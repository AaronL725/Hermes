***** UPDATE 20th Jan 2012 ***** I've noticed there are a few new readers coming in since the thread started up again. The first 9 pages give some good information but the latest reincarnation of this system starts with this post. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...92#post5288392 **************************** I posted a thread a little while ago to try to help newer traders who were maybe struggling a little bit. Unfortunately it got moved to the commercial section due to my excessive enthusiasm for a thread by a commercial member. (I understand the forums moderators reasons for doing this and have no complaints at all). ***UPDATE: I have removed the content of the original thread that got it put into the commercial section. Although the system described there is slightly different than the one I present here there is a lot of good information and lots of charts that you may find interesting and I don't want to have to go over again here so here is the link and you may like to take a look. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=304375 *** At the start of the thread I gave a little of my history and a small breakdown of what it took for me to start to make money from trading. In this thread I am not going to repeat all of that information but rather I am just going to present a system. I'm sure if you wanted to read that thread you could probably work out how to find it and you may find some of the information useful. The system I offer here is slightly different from my system on the other thread. I have included a few indicators in this system because although I can trade perfectly well without them I believe that from a beginning traders point of view it may be useful to have these indicators present to aid in spotting good trades and to aid in entry and exit rules for good trades. The system uses trendlines drawn on the monthly, weekly and daily charts, a 100 ema of the close, heiken ashi candles and stochastics. Drawing trendlines is sometimes a sticky issue but to simplify things we will just say that to draw a trendline you merely connect the lows in an uptrend and the highs in a downtrend. Lots and lots of chart examples will follow. A note on trendlines while we are here. I draw trendlines on monthly charts first. These monthly trendlines are the most reliable s/r levels on a chart. They do tend to cause a reaction in price if not a complete trend reversal. Also, as stated in my other thread, I do draw 2 touch trendlines by which I mean the first touch is the start of the trendline and the 2nd touch is the first connecting point. A lot of people will tell you that a trendline isn't a trendline until the 3rd touch to which I say true but a 4 or 5 touch trendline starts out life as a 2 touch trendline. I use trendlines because they are a good, reliable (on the higher time frames) place to look for reversals in the direction of a trend. I use a 100 ema of the close to help define the longer term trend. Generally I only take trades in the same direction that the ema is sloping unless there is a strong pattern forming such as a flag or triangle. I use Heiken Ashi candles which are average price candles because they filter out a lot of the noise of regular price action. A change in colour at a trendline backed up by stochs in the direction of the main trend gives a good signal. Also they can help you stay in the trade longer as you are less prone to worrying about the day to day noise. I use stochastics (8,3,3,low/high,simple) to confirm the price reversal. Of all the oscillators I find stochastics the most useful to represent what is happening in the momentum of price. I posted a couple of posts on my other thread with an explanation of why I don't like the terms overbought and oversold. Nothing has changed, I still don't like them but I do find that stochs can be useful when looking for good reversals providing you are trading with the trend. Also I believe it is easier to define a good entry point for a newer trader if you use these visual aids. I will post more with chart examples and give detailed entry and exit rules soon. Incidentally this is a system for trading daily charts so if you like to take lots of trades then this is not for you. If you like to make money and don't want to pay your broker a fortune in spreads then you may want to read more.

To set up the charts I find it easier to use normal candlesticks to start with. I move to a monthly chart and zoom it out so far but so I can still see the individual candles. I then draw any trendlines I can see in purple to denote monthly/weekly lines. I then move to the weekly chart and add any new lines I see, sometimes there are none. After that I go to the daily chart and add any lines I see in red to denote shorter term lines. I also "refine" the longer term trendlines on the daily chart as with Metatrader it doesn't put the lines at exact price points. I believe this happens because it puts the lines at the start of the month rather than the specific price. It only takes a minute to turn off the auto scroll and go back and correct them anyway. Once I have the trendlines drawn I can add the rest of the indicators. First I apply the HA candles. These are in Metatrader under custom indicators. Then I add the 100 ema. Since I am using HA candles I also add a 1 period sma of the close to show me the same as a line chart. I don't use the line chart as you can't alter the thickness. Also I switch the chart to a line chart and set the line chart colour as none in the properties box so I just see the HA candles. Then I add the stochastics with the settings 8,3,3,low/high,simple. The first chart is below is usdchf monthly. The second chart is the completed daily chart.

Put quite simply an entry signal for the above usdchf chart would be a heiken ashi colour change back to red at one of the trendlines it is moving towards and the stochastics green crossing back below the red, preferably above the 50 level. Note that you would only take shorts at the moment because the blue 100 ema is moving down and the pair is in an obvious downtrend. Here is an example of eurgbp. I actually took this trade whilst illustrating a trade using my other system but it so happens that I spotted a good trade according to this system too (so much for the indicators but I'm hoping that you will realise that over time anyway). This is a buy entry. The blue 100 ema was breached slighly but nothing to be concerned about as the stochastics and the HA colour change combined with the 3rd touch of the trendline all signals a good buying opportunity. Time will tell if this is going to be a good entry for either system or not. To manage the trade I will move to break even after a move of around 60 to 80 pips on this pair as it tends not to move much more than that. Once it is at break even I will trail the stop behind any minor pullbacks and I will trail more aggressively should the HA change colour against the trend. I will let the stop loss take me out of the trade. Should the trade reach the next trendline I will consider taking profit manually. I have to go to bed for work in the morning now but I will post more about the system and more chart and trade examples as I go along.

It always pays to zoom out your chart a little. Upper channel lines are sometimes very informative too. This is the eurgbp trade, about 30 pips up at the moment. Zoom the chart out a little and you can see an obvious channel forming. The touches are marked in magenta. Is the best place to look for a reversal/take profits in the area marked in light blue? This type of trendline analysis won't work out all the time but it's good to look at possibilities because it may keep you in a good trade for longer.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
having identified the trend based on monthly and daily can you explain your entry like you use lower time frame charts for the purpose of entry

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Hugh I am very interested in your system as I have done the usual and concentrated on lower time frames looking for more "action" whilst losing my money!!! I think the penny has finally dropped (along with a large percentage of my account!) that the longer term charts are a far better place for a fairly inexperienced trader like myself. So I have been searching these forums looking for a simple system that would suit me best. I have found several Trendline based system which really appeal to me and make perfect sense but mostly on much shorter time frames. However your system seems to match my requirements entirely being trendline based on the longer term charts, however I am fairly new to trading so may ask some pretty dumb questions especially around longer term philosophies as I have, up to now been concentrating on shorter timeframes. So heres my first tranche of dumb questions: What time do you carry out your analysis and how often? How many pairs do you monitor and which are they? Which timeframe do you use for entry? Could I use this system on lower timeframes? By that I mean start the process on daily and maybe enter on hourly? (sorry still suffering from an itchy trigger finger) Thanks for sharing your method and explaining it so clearly. I look forward to many successful trades with you. All the best Clive.

Take a look at the chart of eurgbp above. The price approached a 2 touch trendline. The heiken ashi changed colour to green at the trendline and the stochastics crossed at the bottom and started moving up. When these things occur together then you wait until the close of the daily candle and then open your trade. What you are actually trading is the bounce from trendlines with confirmation from the stochastics.

Hello Clive, good to have you along for the ride. Never worry about asking dumb questions because I can guarantee you that even the most experienced traders had to ask the same questions themselves once. Your questions... 1) I love to look at charts on a weekend, the market is closed and I can just spend hours zooming charts out on monthly, weekly and daily. Part of my love of trading these days is just looking at charts! As you are drawing much longer term trendlines you won't need to change them that often. On the daily chart trendlines break more regularly so I will have to move or adjust these on a daily basis. I'd say I look at charts mostly on the weekends but when I check the daily candle each day I will remove or adjust any that are no longer valid as I go along. 2) I monitor all pairs with a spread of 10 or less, depends what broker you are using. As you are only checking the charts once a day this can take as little as 5 mins to check them all. 3) I draw trendlines on monthly and weekly charts and then use the daily for the entries. The exception to this would be if price is approaching a very strong monthly trendline and the daily chart is giving me too much noise in which case I will wait until the weekly chart gives me a better picture. 4) I would really urge you to scratch your finger some other way! The higher the time frame the more reliable the support/resistance that the lines offer. You could trade bounces from daily trendlines using smaller time frame charts which would give you a slightly better entry if it goes right but you have more chance of being shaken out of the trade. It is much less stressful to just watch a daily chart and take your trades on the close of the daily candle. It is possible to use trendlines on the lower time frames like daily, 4 hour and then take trades on 1 hour or 30 min but the lines are more likely to break and less likely to give you good signals. I hope that covers it all? If you need anything else just ask.

Looks like a good system Hugh! I was wondering where your initial stop loss order will be placed? Is it one tick/pip below/above the HA candle before the color change? At the trendline? I agree that it can be less stressfull to trade the day chart, but the longer time frames also have longer drawdowns that can cause a few grey hairs to grow if your money is managed incorrectly. Are the EMA and STOC configs the same for all timeframes? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Some possible set ups to watch. This is gbpusd, first chart is weekly, approaching the trendline again. Will it bounce there? Second chart is daily, stochs are high, 100 ema is sideways. Will it bounce at the trendline and the stochs go lower?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
This next one is eurchf daily. It's in a strong downtrend but currently retracing, maybe a bounce from the trendline and a trend resumption could occur around that location? The good thing about this system is you know what to look for and when and usually a good way in advance.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Chfjpy daily. The daily trendline that it is about to test doesn't look so strong to me as it's only a 2 touch trendline. The monthly trendline in purple just below it looks a much better place to watch for a reversal. It corresponds with the 100 ema and by then the stochs will be quite a bit lower. Notice that in a strong trend the stochs won't always reach the "overbought" or "oversold" areas. If your trading with the trend then a cross of the stochs (with other confirmation such as a trendline and ema) is enough. The other thing to mention on this chart is the apparent breach of the trendline which I have marked in white. This occured around the time of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan which caused a temporary fluctuation in the price. For this reason I do not count those few bars in my trendlines. This is across all yen pairs because in all pairs the price moved swiftly back above the trendline and seems to have resumed the same trend, sometimes to the pip.

Ok, here's audchf, cadchf, cadjpy and usdbgn (yes that is the usd against the Bulgarian Lev, my broker is Bulgarian and it only has a 5 pip spread so why not? Trades pretty smoothly too). I haven't marked the previous touches or the possible touches but if you have read the thread from the start it should be obvious what we are looking at. (if you're really not getting it ask questions, I will answer no problems). One point I want to mention now is not to trade the same pair too many times. Let's say audchf and cadchf both set up in the next few days it is fine to take both trades but be aware that if the chf tanks for any reason then both your trades will go against you at the same time. Don't overexpose yourself to the same currency. When it goes right you will feel like a hero because all 3 or 4 of your chf trades went your way and you made a bundle. When it goes wrong you will feel like a bum for being so stupid. I like to not take more than 2 trades featuring the same currency pair.

Last chart for tonight is gold with fibonacci drawn. Price reached the upper channel line (I posted charts in my other thread, see the first post of this thread for the link), stochs are down. I'm watching the next trendline which corresponds with the 100 ema for a good clear reversal signal in order to buy back into the trend. This will probably correspond with either the 50 or 61.8% retracement level. This is obviously complete speculation, noone can know what will happen next but you can know what you want to see happen in order for you to place a trade and if it happens act on it. If it doesn't happen as you want it to happen then simply readjust your trendlines and wait for the next potential setup to watch. Wait for the trades to come to you and they should be obvious.

Hi RS, sorry I didn't notice this before but obviously your post didn't appear straight away as it needed modding as it's your first post. To answer your questions... one pip one way or the other is a bit close. Usually the stop loss goes the other side of the whole reversal up to 200 pips away but sometimes less. Take the eurgbp trade discussed above, from the entry point to 10 or 12 pips below the last low it is around 100 pips so to keep things round I have just entered a 100 pip stop loss. Eurgbp is not a very volatile pair. Should the HA to change colour and/or the stochs cross against the trade then I would move the stop loss in tight or just close the trade so I wouldn't necessarily always take a full loss. A close the wrong side of the trendline is always a good sign of your trade not going your way. In terms of money management you are rignt that it can seem as though you are losing a lot of pips for every loss. If you are only risking 1 or 2% of your account on each trade then you should still be able to turn the pc off and sleep at night. A 2% loss is unfortunate and feels bad, when it's your turn to catch a good trade that you can add on to as well then you could be banking 10 to 20% of your account on one trade. (or series of trades added on to an original winning trade) I believe these configurations would work for all timeframes. One way to use stochs is to look at the direction of a higher timeframe and only take trades on the lower timeframe in the direction of the higher timeframes stochs. There are a number of ways to look at things and use different indicators but the main indicator and the most reliable at predicting the next price direction (given the right signals) is trendlines and they will be the same on all timeframes. Thanks for your questions and I hope this answers everything?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Great explanation and very clear what you are looking for. It helps to keep that itchy trigger finger under control when I can see possible setups approaching. Thanks again for sharing.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
A pretty quiet week then. The eurgbp trade has been open a week and is a grand 21.5 pips up! It does still look good though. A few trades could be setting up for next week so maybe more action then? Have a good weekend and I'll see you next week.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Eurgbp is grinding it's way slowly in the right direction, still no reason to close the trade. On the face of it nzdchf looks like a good trade, a stoch cross at a decent level and a bounce from not 1 but 2 trendlines. What you have to ask yourself though is how far could this trade go? It looks to me as though there is much too much sideways movement to be able to trade this and there is possible support not far away at the next rising trendline so it's a pass. The second chart is a trade on gbpchf. What worries me slightly about this is that gbpchf needs to continually break historic lows to go further down. I would think this is possible and it's a strong trendline, the trend is obviously down, stochs have crossed at the same level they have been crossing in the past. On the whole it looks like a good trade so I took it. I took the trade a bit earlier than the close of the daily candle but I'm up at 3.30am, such is life. Not too much tends to happen between now and 10 anyway, not usually so much that would change my mind about the trade.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Ted I missed the GBPCHF trade as when I read it the first time I thought you decided against it because it was trading around all time lows. Missed the next sentence which said you took it. As for entering near all time lows, it can also be seen as a very strong indication that the trend down is very, very strong, but maybe when at this level it would be more prudent to trade it as a breakout below the all time low??? Thats what I will do I think put an order in at say 1.2975 and play the breakout or maybe I should wait for break and retest then enter with tighter stop behind 1.3000? Your thoughts on that please? Thanks for a great thread I am definately looking at longer term charts now alongside my day trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
You could wait for the breakout but how much are you missing in the meantime? The signal itself is a valid signal and the all time low thing is only a minor consideration. I would wait for a break and then look for a good entry on the pullback.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
What entry did you get on gbpchf and where is your stop?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
1.3130 and 1.3330

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Here are two interesting charts. First is gbpusd and second is gbpjpy. Both are reaching downwards trendlines. These may well break tomorrow but if they hold, stochs cross and heiken ashi changes colour these could be good trades. Of course I'm already exposed to the gbp twice with my eurgbp long and gbpchf short which means I won't be taking either of these trades but it does tell me something, gbp as a whole is weakening.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Hugh I Like your way of thinking. I went short on the G/J at 123.32 with a stop loss of 132. At the present time I am still short but the whole tendency is downwards. Am I right? John from Durban

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi John, yes the trend is definitely down and gbpusd did turn down away from the trendline today sending all gbp pairs downwards too. The gbpjpy trade is definitely the better trade out of the two despite the fact that gbpjpy hasn't made a significant move down today but I would say that you are better to wait for the close of the daily candle to confirm the stoch cross, etc. Saying that though I am up at 3am again and so I have just taken the trade myself. 132 seems like a very big stop loss, I've just put on 100 pips which isn't much for gbpjpy but I want to see this one go down straight away or I want to be out for not much loss. I took the gbpjpy trade because I closed the eurgbp long today for about a pip profit. The stochs have crossed against the trade and the heiken ashi changed to red. Gbpchf is going in the right direction though, albeit slowly.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hugh, I just came across this thread last night. It seems VERY interesting and I will continue to study it and follow your System. Thank you for your contribution! I'll stay tuned in. Patrick :0)

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Patrick, glad you found the thread, if you need anything let me know.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks Hugh.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi The E/U is moving down with a confirmation on the stochs. My platform is GMT+2 and I am wondering if this is a pullback to continue higher?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Eurusd looks like a nice trade. It bounced slightly above the trendline but the stoch cross looks nice and smooth. Again though it hasn't got far to run so it's not worth the risk. Gbpjpy and gbpchf are both going the right way but they both need to go a bit further before we can move to breakeven or lock in any profit.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hello, sorry, we posted at the same time! I think my post above explains my feeling on eurusd.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Hugh There is plenty news tomorrow, do you mind to upload your chart on the G/CHF please, I have a feeling mine is out of sink. Plenty pips for all John from Durban

Thanks Hugh, now I learned a trick and that is to make a template of my charts and save them for later. Are you working full time? Me, I am a full time pensioner who can't sleep due to ± 40 years of shift work. Plenty pips to all John from Durban

AUDUSD, Daily, 2011 July 29

--- 帖子 #42 ---
CADDKK, Daily, 2011 July 29 CADDKK, Weekly, 2011 July 29 ...and here go Long? If so be aware that the weekly could give a stronger signal for a down. The Stochastics signalize a down at the daily whereas it's a top high at the weekly chart.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
...and weekly candles are looking indifferent with the slightly touch that a more weekly downward movement seems possible. We'll see!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I do work full time, although I am building my account slowly it doesn't fund my lifestyle yet

--- 帖子 #45 ---
As it's such a strong trendline you could take a short given the right signal but the higher probability trades are when the price swings back into the direction of the main trend after a pullback to a trendline or other support or resistance.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
What spread are you paying on that pair? For me the daily is not at a trendline or any other form of s/r so the turn of stochs and heiken ashi are not confirmed by anything. The signal must occur at least at the third touch of a trendline.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes, weekly candles are sideways and it reflects on the daily chart. Nice charts, thanks for posting. Your thought processes are sound and your charts appear well set up.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Some trades picking up this week, gbpchf 170 up so moved to +100 pips locked in. Gbpjpy floating around +100 so moved to breakeven. Not much else setting up for next week at the moment but that can change. If the two above trades keep going we should be banking some good pips for the month anyway.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hey Hugh Is it better to wait for the second candle on the HA? Last night the NZD/USD went backwards and repainted! Thanks!! Tony Costa

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Tony (o hola, verdad?), Heiken ashi candles shouldn't repaint. The definition of repainting is when the candle closes and the bar is one colour and then after a period of time it changes colour again. I have never seen a heiken ashi candle change colour after the candle has closed, once closed always the same. Bear in mind that with nzdusd it is in a major uptrend so any ha change even if backed up with a good stoch cross is always going to be a lower probability trade. The best way to trade nzdusd at the moment is to let it retrace without you and then if/when the trend resumes at a clear trendline you can buy it with much, much higher probability and confidence of the outcome.

Nice thread. Subscribed...

Some things to think about on the weekend... If you are reading this and you are a new trader or not making money yet here are a few ideas to ponder. I've probably said some of this before and most of it can definitely be found already on other threads, particularly some famous and long standing ones. I'm not going to apologise for repeating this and I am in no way claiming these ideas as my own but I figure the more times you read the truth you don't want to hear from different sources maybe the quicker you will believe it and put it into practice? 1) Trading on demo I used to be dead against trading on demo because it doesn't allow for the psychological effect of putting your own hard earned money at risk. The fact is however that if you can't make money on demo then you can't make money live. I understand the argument that unless the monetary sums are meaningful you can't take it seriously, etc but think long and hard about it, if you are a new trader your first goal is to make money and lots of it. The trouble is that if you are a new trader then you have next to no chance of making money anyway. Unless you have intensive mentoring by someone that really knows what they are doing (and still people fail at trading even with that advantage) then you are unlikely to be able to trade correctly and make money consistently so why throw your money down the drain by trading live from the start? Honestly, seriously, please... Try your hand at trading on a demo account first. Your goal in the first year of trying to trade should be just to get the mechanics right, learn when, why and how to take a trade and when, why and how to exit. Once you have been doing this correctly for a period of time and you feel you can do it live then give it a try, just keep your account size and trade size small. I understand that some more experienced traders might read this and say it's rubbish and they made money from day one and demo is a waste of time but for the majority of traders the only way to learn is to lose money live and then go back to demo until they get it right. Wouldn't it be better if new traders knew to start with demo from the start and only go live once they are breakeven or better traders? 2) Leverage I know I've mentioned this before on my previous thread (link on post 1) but it's worth mentioning again. If you do what I did and set your max leverage to 500 to 1 "just in case" then you are asking for trouble. Take the time to work out just how much leverage you need in order to be able to have 2 or 3 trades open with 1 or 2% of your account and set your leverage accordingly. 3) Systems The more I trade the more I realise that it's not about the entry it's about the management. By far the most visited area of this forum is the trading systems section and yet more often than not the focus of the systems on offer is the entry. Trade management and position sizing is usually an afterthought at best (not knocking anyone, I've got this thread there too after all). Let's be absolutely frank, you CAN just look at a chart and say, "I think the price is going to go down", sell it, put a stop loss on and make money. The key is the old phrase, "cut your losses short and let your winners run". If you open a trade and it hits your stop for -20 pips then you have lost 1% of your account or whatever. If it goes your way then when do you close it? That's by far the more important question than when should you enter. Seriously, you can just draw a few trendlines, determine the trend, jump in when price looks like moving away from the trendline and hold the trade until it starts moving against you. So why be so worried about where you enter? Just trade with the trend and enjoy the ride. Risk/reward of 2, 3 or 4 to 1 is easily possible with breakout strategies (or most others) and at 3 to 1 you only have to be right a quarter of the time to break even. Quit worrying about the entry and learn to hold a trade longer. 4) Position sizing Once you've gone live and you're feeling the emotional aspect of trading you will know what this is about. It's true that you do have to trade with a risk level that makes you feel as though your trading is worthwhile but unless you are completely comfortable with losing the amount you have risked then you will be more prone to closing trades early or moving to breakeven too soon. I can lose 1 or 2% of my account and not feel too bad because I know it is only a matter of time until the trade that makes me 5 or 6% of my account comes along. If you are trading with too big a position size and are not comfortable with losing that pound or dollar (or whatever) amount then you will be too emotionally tight to trade properly. 5) Learning to take a loss Related to the above. When I first started trading I couldn't take losses. It's one of the biggest newbie mistakes, either not using a stop loss because it's only a losing trade once you've closed it or possibly worse, moving the stop loss when the price got near (again). After I had experienced a loss (finally) I used to go into a frenzy of emotions and not be able to trade properly for the rest of the day. I lost a lot of money on revenge trades. These days a loss is a loss, it's just a part of trading and I never worry too much because I never lose too much of my balance on one trade (see above). 6) Patience/Little and Often Patience used to be a big problem of mine. I just couldn't wait to be in a trade because you have to be in a trade to make money, right? Wrong! Or right actually but more importantly you have to be in the right trade. Waiting for the right trade can take time but one thing is for sure, taking trades out of impatience will cost you money in the long term. The other aspect of patience is taking small wins often. I've lost count of the amount of times I've deposited 100 or 200 pounds and raced it up to 1000 pounds in a day (I was an awesome trader as long as it went my way) and then lost it all just as quickly. It is simply not sustainable to trade in this way with high leverage and holding on to bad trades until they come good. What I have learnt is that little and often is the best way. I'd rather risk 1% and make a steady stream of 2 or 3% gains than risk 50% (or often the whole balance) in the hope that it goes my way in the infamous s**t or bust method. That has to be enough for now surely? I've enjoyed putting these ideas across and I hope you've enjoyed reading it? If you have any question then please ask.

This system is one of the simplest way of trading with at the end of the month/year a good profit. To all traders I want to say is accept losses from time to time and start trading by weekly or Daily systems, unexperienced traders or beginners will loose a lot of money when they trade on short timeframes and to switch from system to system.. This system works well for me the last years with profits from 20-65% a year. Compare that with youre credit on youre bank... and you are a more succesfull then managers. Dutchsignals

Whilst I'm about it let's discuss some more trading nonsense... 3. a savvy investor buys when everyone else is selling and sells when everyone else is buying. What utter s**t. That may have been true at some stage in the stock market, perhaps. In forex it is just utter s**t. Listen to me really carefully, I want to sell when everyone else is selling and I want to buy when everyone else is buying. You know why? It's because that's what pushes the price in the direction of my trade. Besides that the forex market is so huge that it doesn't matter what you do the market will not react to your individual trade. Besides that again, if you are trading a micro account and/or you are classed as a retail trader then your broker most likely takes the other side of the trade anyway because they know that more than likely you're going to burn your sorry ass sooner or later anyway.

Hey Hugh. This is the first thread that I've enjoyed so far in a long time. Keep up the good work! I'm looking forward to more!!

My sentiments exactly! 20-65/100% a year could be easily earn with this strategy when using it in a correct way (e.g. money management, leverage factor, e.g. # 17 , # 52 , # 58 , p.1 is also clear) like Hugh has described above. FXcube .

Quite a bit of volatile choppy movement today. Gbpchf stopped out for +100 and Gbpjpy stopped out at breakeven. Not bad so far then, eurgbp +1 pip and gbpchf +100 a running total of +101 pips. Not quite as much as I would have expected but we are in the quietest time of the year for decent trends. Gbpusd looks like a possible trade but the movement to the left is very choppy and the 100 ema is moving sideways signalling the lack of much of an acual trend so I will pass. Other than that it is very quiet with not much setting up so now is the time to sit on your hands and watch. When the perfect setup comes along there will be big pips to be had so there is no rush. I'll keep you posted when something comes up.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Not much has been setting up recently, the summer can be quiet for decent trends, so I have adapted the basics of my method to suit the conditions. A viable way to trade Heiken Ashi candles is to draw s/r lines and trendlines on a chart and just trade HA colour changes near those levels. I'll try and post a few more examples tomorrow but here's usdcad taken this evening. The 1.000 parity level looks like holding the price below it, HA changed colour (I missed Fridays entry but today looks ok). That's a 100 pip stop loss.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This is usdchf, be nice to see a red HA candle within the next few days.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Here's another trade, euraud.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I must say pretty good stuff man...nice approach...very clean charts

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks. I'm not trading it so much over the summer period which was why I was looking into that other thread but when things start trending again this is a really good way to make some nice money.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
i m also following similar system down to H4... why is this thread dying.... I request ppl here to share their findings and lets rock the money on the table...... I ll start posting also and ask ppl to please share as well

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Just finished reading and studying the thread. Simple but effective. Nice clean and uncluttered charts. I plan to follow. Looking foward to more posts.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Winston, things are pretty sideways at the moment so not much going on but patience will pay off, when we get back into trending markets we'll be quids in.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Some interesting charts to be watching. We're getting back into trending season soon, there should be some action in the next few weeks.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
At the start of this thread (or maybe the original one?) I spoke at length about new traders needing to only trade daily charts until they get it right. I'm still of that opinion but over the summer whilst it has been quiet I have been trading 1 and 5 min charts using a very similar method to my daily system. My own personal view is that you shouldn't be afraid of trading the smaller timeframes. Daily takes a lot of patience because you can sit and watch the charts for weeks and not have a clear and valid signal and then you get one and promptly lose 200 pips. Of course the long term, 1000 or 2000 pip trades don't happen all the time but you're never going to catch one of them trading 5min eurusd! You need to have a balance in all things and if you have been trading daily charts for a while and got that right then don't be afraid to look at other timeframes. The advantage of course of trading lower timeframes is that you can use a bigger position size and still only risk a small percent of your account. If you're going to start trading 5 min charts then I suggest sticking to the majors because of the lower spread and start with 0.01 (or whatever your minimum is) positions. A 10 pip stop loss at 0.01 is £0.62p at the current pip value! You can lose a lot of those until you get it right and the key thing is to cut your losses short and let your winners run. It's always down to money and trade management. That's why I like Heiken Ashi candles, they nearly always keep you in a good trade longer. If you've caught a good trade and have some pips locked in then don't close it until a HA candle closes against your trade. This can be 10 or 15 candles on 5 min charts netting you 50 to 100 pips on a good trend! Now I have started trading lower timeframes I will definitely continue because it only takes 2 or 3 good trades a week (!) to pull in a nice sum of money and it complements my longer term trading nicely. Maybe it merits a different thread to discuss the slightly different strategies involved. Anyone interested?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Hugh I have read your thread and I find it interesting and enjoyable. I will be following your methods on the long term time frames closely on my demo account. thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Slurpee from the Trading Journal is using a very similar system to yours.(Daily easy no stress charts). He uses the 100 ema as a trend identifier and enters on the stoch cross. With your HA candle, this cross is actually confirmed. I will be following your thread as well. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for the info, I'll take a look.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Usdchf, eurchf and gbpchf are setting up nicely by the look of things. I've got entries on 2 of them already from hourly charts and I've got pending orders so if it breaks todays low then I'm in short at a decent price. Here's a picture of gbpchf, the others look similar.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Hugh, This is an awesome thread so far, thanks for sharing your time. For me Just using PA alone doesn't work. To much ambiguity around what I was supposed to be "looking at'. A lot of traders out there dismiss indicators, as they are "lagging", but quietly Ive found looking at HA Candles and the Stoch helps to frame up what im looking at, helping me to better understand which way the market is moving. Ive found using trendlines helps also. On your last post, the Stoch setting was 8,3,8...is there a reason for this? as Im following along, learning as I go. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi, thanks for your positive comments. PA alone is fine and I did use ordinary candles for a long time but I just prefer Heiken Ashi. Yes all indicators definitely do lag but they are ok to use as long as you understand what they are supposed to be telling you. I find stochs one of the better indicators because once you are used to using them they give you information about the trend and the strength of pullbacks within the trend. A good smooth pullback often leads to a good smooth impulse wave. As for the settings I have been looking into what actually changes when you change them and I find using 8,3,8 makes them appear smoother. I can't find a %K setting I like better than 8. 3 for the sma works fine. I have been using 8 for the smoothing recently and changed the method to close/close and I prefer the smoother look. Also try 6 and see if you prefer that. I think it's a personal preference thing and having an understanding of what the indicator does and doesn't do. Notice also that rather than take entries straight away these days I am putting pending orders below the days low to reduce the stop loss required. The price will get me into the trade only when it starts moving in my direction. Also I have been looking at shorter timeframes for some entries recently such as hourly. The way I see it is that any method you can use to get you into a trade more safely or easily is a good thing. Thanks for reading the thread and hope to see you again soon.

Hey Hugh I am glad you are back....was disapointed when I didn't see you for a while....forgot about the summer months slow!!!! Blessings Tony

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi Tony, I was around but not much was happening. It's time to bank some pips!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
My positions as of now... Usdchf 1 +162 pips Usdchf 2 +36 Eurchf +171 Gbpchf 1 +510 Gbpchf 2 +151 Not bad for 2 or 3 days "work". I've still got entries on euraud, eurcad, audusd and nzdusd which are doing ok but I think these chf pairs are really nice and the reason I keep doing this.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hugh I made 250 pips last night on this system,live!!! A big thanks to you!! By the way, are you not using TL anymore? Tony

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi hugh, like your work and as I want to trade the daylies have a few questions; 1. Low - I asume you are you setting orders under prev day low/high. 2. Pending Orders - how far under the low are you placing orders to reduce fakeys 3. % Indy - can you post the indy shown on your chart in top left hand corner a few posts back, looks interesting

--- 帖子 #84 ---
moving averages are moving trendlines

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Good to hear you made some pips! I use trendlines but sometimes they are "mental" as in I can see them without marking them.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi, glad you're liking what I am doing. You are right that I am setting pending orders under the previous days low to get in with the next wave of the trend. I don't worry about fake moves, I just use a 100 pip stop (200 on chf or jpy pairs) and move to break even fairly quickly. If I am wrong I am wrong. The % indy is a work in progress and does not always work correctly so bear with me and i will release it.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Very true, I like 100 ema and 200 sma. It's not a definite rule but seems to look nice on a chart.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
i know what you mean i also use the 100 and 200 emas with the addition of the 50...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
The more of us the better ;-)

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here is a short trade I took yesterday. +85 pips and counting. I pay attention to the stoch cross momentum. (60-40 levels).

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Nice trade. I posted a chart of that a few days ago with the setup. I'd trail that closely though as you never know when it will snap back and how much further will it go down bearing in mind the huge support not far below? If it breaks that it's going to be a huge trade. One thing that I like the idea of is taking multiple entries with small positions to "test the water". There are plenty of other threads that trade longer term trends most notably building an equity millipede which I think is an excellent thread. It's especially good if you have a small account. Why not take entries for three days in a row with 0.01 or 0.1 whatever you can bear losing 100 or 200 pips at and get to breakeven and leave it for 3 or 4 weeks? By the way I closed out all my trades except for the chf pairs. Gbpchf +546 and +189 Usdchf +194 Eurchf +223 These could run a long way. I'm going to enter more on breaks of support on the 4 hour chart, when it occurs. Also I will trail my stop behind that broken support so it hopefully acts as resistance for a pullback.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I have just placed more pending orders below support, let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi Hugh these have been very bearish until this august when debt issues in US and EURO caused a rally back up. I think as long as we are trading with trend on PWL then should not go far wrong ST

--- 帖子 #94 ---
That's my thoughts on it. I'm happy to keep taking trades at breaks of s/r until I have 4 or 5 positions at breakeven and then hold them until the daily turns around on the heiken ashi.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Here are current trades from my live account. Currently, I'm up +1600 pips on these pairs. Thanks Hugh . Eurjpy +175 Eurchf +580 Usdchf +320 Gbpchf +570 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nice charts, nice trades! Consider taking more entries. Once you have one at break even the rest are easier. I'm starting to use lower timeframes to "load up" these trends. You could get 4 or 5 entries open for small risk and then just hold them for the long term. Trail the stops on those and don't consider closing until the daily shows weakness. In fact if you trail behind the top of the first green candle you shoudln't get shaken out by a small pullback. Glad to see someone has been putting this into practice to positive effect and shown the patience required.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
What direction do you want to trade this and when? Just a heads up, nothing set in stone.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
The biggest point about the above post is to constantly take into account the higher timeframes and work down until you see something tradeable. Monthly, suggests down. Weekly, suggests down. Daily, is down. H4, pulling back, could I sell that a bit higher? Maybe, then maybe trail it on the daily or even weekly. A lot of maybes in trading but nothing lost by just looking and using logic.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Hugh, Just wanted to say thanks for a very nice and straight forward thread. Your explanations of things are very clear. Good luck with your trades ( I,m in most of them as well) Take Care Jay

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi Jay, thanks for the post, I appreciate your time.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
The pairs I am watching now are eurusd, gbpusd, audusd, nzdjpy and audjpy. If you look at the monthly charts these could be ones to get some nice entries on at break even and then just hold them for months.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Hugh Im new to this post . would you mind posting charts when convenient thanks miki

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hello, plenty of charts all over the thread. See above for gbpusd.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Hugh. If you don't mind , can I throw a chart at you for some feedback.... ... Its a pretend/demo trade , no risk... just trying to figure out the Market.... Draw up what I think I see using the methods talked about here. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #105 ---
That's in and out a bit quick for me. If you've sold with the trend just hold it until the HA candles change colour against your trade. Preferably once you've got a good trade at break even then move up a time frame and manage the trade there. The Heiken Ashi on GbpUsd monthly is red and the stochs are high, we could be in for a good drop here, maybe open 2 positions and manage one on the daily and one on the weekly or even monthly until it turns?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
About 50 pips up on all of these except audjpy, I didn't want to double up too much on the same currency. I'll leave these for a while now and try and get another entry in 100 or 200 pips time.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Montly and Weekly looks like sell indeed, but when I look at the Daily the stoch is oversold. Also the EMA 100 and 200 are slightly up with the 100 above the 200. I think I'll wait until a retrace on the daily before entering. I did went short on USDCHF and EURCHF today with help of your system. I am a bit late in actually, because on both pairs there have been some down HA candles already, but I just started today with this system. The pairs you suggested I didn't take. Mainly because the pairs go against or are circling around the 100 and 200EMA. Maybe I give those EMA's to much credit. Don't know yet. But better safe than sorry and better patience than rush into a trade because I "have" to trade! Thanks

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I know what you mean so yes it may be best to wait for a retrace on the daily (look at the 4 hour!) but oscillators can stay oversold for a long time. I've just put pending orders on all pairs below the next s/r and if they get hit then the first order will be at breakeven so my risk will stay constant or I wil have some profit locked in. If it keeps going down and I get some more pending orders hit then I'll definitely have profit locked in. We'll see how it goes, if it does retrace I'll just renter after the retrace. Somehow I want to get those 4 or 5 entries and hold them on the monthly. Also the 100 and 200 ema's are lagging indicators so the start of a downtrend won't pull them into line straight away. These days I'm giving MUCH more weight to the higher timeframes.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Here are my next pending orders. If these hit I'll be a good 100 to 200 pips up on the original orders and I will get them to break even. Eurusd 1.4045 Gbpusd 1.6045 Audusd 1.0495 Nzdjpy 62.40 These are just below some pretty strong daily support. If these break it should be a good move down after.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thanks for the reply. I learned that buying/selling just above/below a swing high/low is a good thing, because the odds the trend continues are better. Support turns in a resistance and vice versa, so the trend has new room to continue. Perhaps indeed a good idea to first open positions when the heiken ashi candles change collors (with trendline / stoch / higher timeframe confirmation) and to add positions on the break of the latest high/low, like you're doing in your latest post. Also it is true that EMA's lag and stoch can be long in overbought/oversold, so I will keep that in mind! Best wishes, Jules

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks for the reply Hugh. Im still trying to work out which time frame is bet to watch, given my demo Acct has 5K in it, and the smallest I can go down on pip size is 1 pip = 1$. This is why I look at the 4h or 1H charts. As stated above, sometimes the timeframes give conflicting Stoch crosses, which leaves me unsure if I should take the trade because of oversold/overbought on the time frame below. Probably better to wait until theres a retrace then take the trade when both line up in the same direction ? Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Exactly!

--- 帖子 #113 ---
That could've worked out better. Swiss National Bank got involved in eurchf and sent everything else flying with it. I've still got a couple of positions open of the originals and when everything settles back down I'll be back to plan A.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Great thread and system Hugh. I've been trying to find a simple, proven system that I can trade on both long and short time frames and just come across your thread. I'd love to hear how you trade the lower time frames using this method and see how it differs and your thoughts on how well it works. How does it vary from the daily system? What time frame/s are you working with? Do you use different MA and Stoch settings on the lower TFs? Does your win/loss ratio drop at the lower TFs? Thanks, J

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Hugh I've been reading your thread with interest. Through long and sometimes painful experience (blow account), I've come to the conclusion that higher timeframes are the ones to trade. I've attached a chart of GbpUsd. Can you tell me if I've setup the trendlines and resistance lines correctly ? and if so is my assumption regarding the next trade correct ?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi PB, the lower timeframe system is a work in progress at the moment but I'm making progress slowly. At the moment I am just trading eurusd on a 5 min chart and the indicators have stayed more or less the same. The win/loss ration is lower at the moment but I believe with experience and practice it will be improved. As soon as I have settled on the plan I will start a new thread to discuss it.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
The chart looks fine to me and that is definitely a good place to look for a trade. You've got trendline and horizontal s/r. Wait to see a clear heiken ashi change combined with the stochs crossed and moving back up above the 20 level. Remember to keep your position size relatively small because it may give you a perfect looking entry and then still go wrong. It happens. The trick on the higher timeframes is to be able to weather a few 200 pip losses in a row before you hit a run of 500 or 600 pip trades in a row!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks Hugh - I'll stick with running the demo on daily and H4 charts for now. Look forward to hearing about your progress on the lower TFs. J

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thanks for that Hugh. I was working from home today, so was able to keep an eye on the charts, and I saw that the Gbpusd had spiked through resistance and the 100ema on the hourly chart, the HA had changed colour, so reasoning that it is hopefully going to hit my buy point on the daily chart I posted earlier, I took a quick small sell trade. Reading your post on using lower timeframes made me look at the possibility. I'm at breakeven now so nothing to lose. :0)

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Looks good but why set a take profit? What if the price rockets through that level? Better to stay at break even until the heiken ashi changes against you which may be soon or may be next week. If you're of a nervous disposition and don't like to give profits back then trail the stop loss 5 pips above the top of the heiken ashi 2 before the current candle to lock in profit as the trade matures but protect you in case it spikes upwards.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I don't know what your take profit was but it looks like trailing it was a good idea ;-)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Hugh, I know you have a few other successful forums going right now, but I thought Id post here as , this type of trading makes the most sense to me. Your thoughts comments of course are welcome. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Looks like a reasonable trade but I'd suggest you don't use a take profit, this type of trade is better left to run as far as it can. I would trail the stop loss behind the high of the penultimate (second to last) closed candle and if it creates a wick then you know the trend is slowing down, trail it more closely.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Just had a look and seen the trade didn't work out. I notice you are trading 4 hour charts, I think daily charts are better. The trend on that pair at the moment is somewhat sideways and difficult to predict, maybe switch to dailies for a while unless there is a very clear trend on h4?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Yeah took a hit on that trade...Bummer what you gonna do. Still in Demo mode. Ill take a look at the Daily time frame, however I have found some success on the 4H charts as well, currently short on the NZ/USD. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Heres my latest trade. Looking at the 4 H chart had some good reasons to try a short trade. It was a break even in the end, but left pips on the table. Any thougts comments welcome... Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #127 ---
My first thought is that you were trying to trade a countertrend move in a strong uptrend. These are always lower probability. The best way to trade a change in trend is to wait for the uptrend line to be broken and retested from below. Then put a pending order below the initial break out candle so that if the trend change continues then you are in the trade with the momentum. I'll try and post an example sometime.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thx Hugh..

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Looking at it again the other thing I would say is look at where it stopped. Right at the previous resistance level of that last move up. Resistance became support.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Your right Hugh, I noticed that as well after the trade was closed. Such an obvious place really. I completely ignored the previous resistance area and was focusing on the indicators getting the entry right. I know you've spoken about this before, it doesn't matter so much on entry as it matters how you manage the trade once on board. That area should have been a clue as to where to take some profit...still learning as I go. I have to say thou the HA Candles with the indicators attached have really helped me identify how the market is moving and how to take advantage of that. Also, moving away from the lower time frames i.e H1 charts and focusing on the 4H charts has been better for me. Who knows maybe D1 charts next ? Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Nothing will tell you the direction the price will move next. Just concentrate on allowing yourself to be wrong more than you are right and making more when you win than you lose when you are wrong and you are THERE! I so wish I had been told this 4 years ago!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I'm really pleased you're starting to get some focus on what actually matters in trading. At the end of the day there is not one indicator that will tell you for sure what will happen next which for me makes them all redundant. The only thing you can know for sure is that if the price is going down it will POSSIBLY go down some more and therefore it is worth selling. If price is going up it will POSSIBLY go up some more and therefore it is worth buying. To get to this stage so early in your trading career is a massive bonus, some people never get there. It took me years to figure this out even though everyone was telling me this from the start! You have the know how at your fingertips you just have to assemble it in the right order. Think about a trend. Does price ever just go in a straight line up or down? NO! So logically you MUST use a big enough stop loss to allow the price to do it's "thing" and not stop you out. As I said before you can't KNOW where the price is going but if you develop enough "feel" for the market then you can form an opinion of where the price is going to reach next. Look at 1.25 in eurusd right now. Gbpusd looks definitely bearish right now. Lots of other examples BUT... Be prepared to be wrong. I drive a lorry for a living at the moment. If I'm wrong in that profession then people can DIE! If I'm wrong as a trader then the best thing I can do is shut the trade down. It's no great shakes to be wrong about the direction of a trade. The wrong thing to do is to convince yourself that you're right and so hold on so long that you accrue a huge loss. That is why most traders lose money and I repeat, don't waste your time with indicators, they can't tell you shit. If it's going up, buy it, if it's going down, sell it. That's all there is to it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really hope this sinks in quickly because I lost a lot of money in the process of finding this out even though everyone told me this from the start!!!!!!!!!!! Reading the above makes me think that Steven Spielberg should be involved somewhere along the line. Actually I'm a bit drunk and thought that I had lost the above but found it again in a different tab and so answered again with the half assed answer above. I can't emphasise enough the importance of not being drawn in to the indicator trap. It's a game of probabilities and in actual fact you could probably change the capitalised words above from possibly to probably and therefore make a killing. Just learn it early and don't do what most people do and try to predict what will happen next because nobody can know. Good luck with your trading and please post results.

Another thing that springs to mind is that Renko is far superior to time based charts. Research it and let me know what you think.

Hugh, I have been trading for over 40 years and have been looking at Forex for the past few. Many years ago I used the FX market to hedge out some currency risk in my Japanese Warrant trading. See my story at www.perfectstormtradingstrategy.com Your thread on using long term trends to trade is the best I have seen at Forexfactory. It clearly will give the so called newbee and hopefully some of the others, a real good way to make some lowere risk profits in this market. Bravo. You may also be able to use RSI set to 10 to help. Again, I agree that the overbought, oversold is basically BS and the cross above 50 is much better. Keep on with the good work!!!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hey Hugh, Just read thru yout last few posts. Your totally right about indicators. For me I use TL S&amp;R and PA analysis to make my decisions, however the TDI indicator (or CCI 6) on the 4H charts helps me look at a potential trade entry in the right direction. Interestingly, I noticed that when the market is/has been trending for sometime, I start looking as to how to get into the market in the opposite direction. (picking tops/bottoms anyone ?) What Ive started looking at recently is what if I drop down a time frame i.e 4H to 1H and trade in the same direction after say a small pullback Im much more successful. Its something Im going to Use/ experiment with more. Anyways, Ill keep posting here, chart examples included, and we'll see what happens. Thanks again for your replies. SR

Thanks for your kind words.

No worries. At the end of the day it is only ever down to what works for you so if that method is best for you then run with it. Don't forget to record all your trades, ideally with screenshots, so you can go back through and learn from mistakes as well as successess. Looking forward to you posting charts here.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi, Im going short on the E/U on the 1H chart. demo of course Im doing this as real time as I can.....so no one can say I posted after the fact LOL, Wish me luck...

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Seemed like a good trade, not sure what's causing this bounce right now but it could easily turn in your favour.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Why 1h charts now though? I still think daily is best. You trade less but less is more.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Hugh !! A quick update...upon looking at the chart Ive posted i noticed the 4H was still going up...I just got in from work and took the trade without completely thinking...Anywho ill stick it out to see what happens. Im still committed to learning and using this system, just need to be more patient...I agree about Daily charts...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Heres the 4h chart i mentioned still in positive territory....Think I jumped the Gun again....must follow the rules...when CCI 6 is below the 0 line on and Stochs are negative on the 4H then look to go short...on lower TF

--- 帖子 #143 ---
The London open will make or break it. I think everyone is still long term bearish the euro but there is news and opinion suggesting we could get a major correction at this point. I wouldn't put too much faith in that but who knows? It's always worth taking the higher timeframes into account. When everything is going in the same direction then you have a higher probability. I think with lower timeframes you need to remember that you will get more trades but with slightly lower probability and with more trades comes more losers. If you trail the winners effectively then you should still make a decent profit.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Yes, you were trading against the 4 hour trend but it could still work out.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
LOL....and that's what happens when you break the rules...out for a loss... All constructive comments welcome...actually encouraged... Im here to learn and this is a good way of doing that. Me first....Points in hindsight 4h clearly still up. CCI 6 above 0 line, uptrend line intact, no evidence on 4 H chart of reversal to downside....

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Heres another chart to look at...all demo of course, until I find the way thru to making consistent profits. The 4h is down on the CCI 6 and Stochs, prices are rolling over to the downside the same direction as the 4h so we'll see what happens... cheers

Sl to BE.. Time to hit the sack,,,,,

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I'm not disagreeing with any of that!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
So we're on 15 min charts now?! Looked like a reasonable trade to take and I see it worked out so hard to say much against it!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi, yeah the trade worked out for a profit....however it was a BE day... Still learning....

--- 帖子 #151 ---
just got in....lets see how this one works out

--- 帖子 #152 ---
You're not trading trend continuations here, you seem to always pick moves against the trend. This type of trade can work out but it's just as likely that this is a pause in the trend, the price will come down and meet a support level and then take off again in the direction of the main trend. I'll try and post some examples in a few hours time.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
sweet...Cheers for that...

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hey hugh heres that trade I did from last night. Its still going up around 77 pips...I like to go back and see how old trades did...I also need to learn to let winners ride...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
And of course my loss as well....from yesterday I guess at least i took the loss which was small and didn't let the move continue against me...

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I was also looking at this one but its in the same currency as im already in a NZ $ trade so dont know if its a good idea...Ill watch it all the same to see how it would have turned out

--- 帖子 #157 ---
This is two entries on eurjpy with the trend, easy to spot. Your trades above all generally go against the trend.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
yip I see what your saying. Back to the drawing board...

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Looks like the USD tide is turning. Most xxxusd and usdxxx pairs are looking similar. This is a 4 hour trade in the direction of the daily trend. By the look of it it will need a 150 pip stop loss. I'll wait til 11am for my 4 hour candle close to take the trade.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Looking through I think euraud or gbpusd might be better trades.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I've gone for euraud, just over a 100 pip stop, let's see how this goes.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hey Hugh, Thanks for posting back man...thought I was out here on a limb on my own. Im just here to learn, nothing more, no ego to damage....your input is greatly appreciated...let me take a look at your last posts...although its Saturday morning here around 1230am... Have a good weekend otherwise.... Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hugh, Heres my take on the E/A trade...you have posted, and I guess its where I need to grow a set.... The Daily is turning up ( both Stoch and CCI but its in a downtrend...clearly. How do you determine when a trade is good going in the oppo from the daily like this one....just curious..as clearly on the 4H it looks like a good short.. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #164 ---
sorry heres what im talking about...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
My 4H chart....just to confirm were looking at the same thing....

--- 帖子 #166 ---
The downtrend is strong enough on the daily to go with what the 4 hour is saying. Overall I prefer taking trades on the daily which would mean waiting for the stochs etc to turn on the daily and the HA to change. The 4 hour just gets you in earlier and the only way you can do this is if the trend is strong enough. Also I'm prepared to be wrong.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Also every pair involving the eur is starting to turn down and every pair involving the usd is starting to move for the USD. Aud looks like it could stay more or less where it is in relation to the usd whereasthe eur is looking weakish so I'm happy to be short euraud.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Sjr, I was looking for your explanation, but where I can found the indictors which u using in you chart, thanks

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Use the search bar at the top of the page for "cci histogram". Sjr is using a 6 period cci to give a similar reading to the TDI indicator (search that too, it's at the start of the "trading made simple" thread).

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Just under 60 pips up after 4 hours, not bad. I won't move to break even yet in case it spikes up before it carries on. I'll wait til it's 100 pips up before I move to BE. Sjr, another point I forgot to mention is the 1.25 round number. The price didn't bounce off it but it did turn close enough for me to put my stop 25 pips behind it. I've now got at least one barrier between my stop and the price. It doesn't mean it won't get stopped out, it justs give me that barrier.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Sjr, thanks ,I will try yo found it, what about the SSTO.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
50 pips up at the moment and coming towards the weekend so I've moved to BE already. Have a good weekend all.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I've sold this eurjpy as well just before the weekend. The jpy weakened somewhat this week but seems to be fighting back, also the eur is just going sideways with a good chance of dropping lower so eurjpy seems like a good pair to be short, also the stochs and HA line up too. The stop is only 75 or so pips away behind the 100 round number. This is one that I will move to break even quite quickly if I get the chance. Euraud trade is now 70 pips up.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hugh, Great work on that call. I can only hope to be that good one day. Its Sat am here so done for the week, with some home work to do..(study Charts) !! I believe this system you introduced here is really good, I just need to practice it more to gain confidence and experience.. Have a great weekend.. SR

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks mate, I only just realised that I called a possible trade about an hour before it came up! There's no mystery to it, it's all there in the charts. The one thing that really helps and that I might not have mentioned before is looking at the major pairs to determine the best cross. Earlier I looked at gbpusd (wouldn't have worked out by the way), eurusd (just went sideways) and euraud. What made euraud stick out was that eur was looking weaker than aud and I initially thought both would go down. In fact eur went nowhere and aud pushed up further but either way the technical analysis on euraud was correct, the stochs and the HA called it, I was just selective in the pair I chose for the reasons mentioned. This is definitely a trial and error thing but I find myself doing it more and more automatically these days. Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Also notice I've got 3 things on my chart. Heiken ashi candles, large round numbers and stochs. That's it. Nice and clean, basic information.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks for the reply Hugh. I looked at the G/U potential trade that you decided not to get in on. Turned out you made a great call. The thing that I want to develop is to use good sound TA using the usual suspects, PA, Trend lines Support resistance etc. But, as I dont have a third eye yet as to how the markets move, and I believe some people do, I need another indicator, or system that helps me stay on the right side of the trade. your clean charts and use of TL with Stochs is just what Im currently looking for. I believe the TDI (cci 6) really compliments your system using the HA candles. However, I have been faked out a few times using the Stochs by themselves, and found the cci 6 can help confirm if its a valid signal to get into the market. See the attached chart that I drew up, confirming your decision not to get into the G/U.. Id really like to hear your opinion, also, if you think it starts to complicate things more, Ill gladly step aside to let this thread develop on its own in respect to you . Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Heres another you were looking at. Both the cci 6 and Stochs crossed but prices havent followed thru ..yet. Im thinking, maybe I need another confirmation other than the cross. Im looking at only entering a trade after a cross, and only when prices break the previous candles low/high. That means prices have to be moving in the right direction to be filled. Also the chart shows no TL break, another clue as to not getting in... Just some thoughts... SR

--- 帖子 #179 ---
eur/aud trade so far with some comments...Im a newbie so take with pinch of salt...lol. TL broken, CCI 6, Stoch crossed. In a downtrend...looks like a good start. will be curious to see how it unfolds... Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I can see your point, on this occasion it would have worked out but then there will be plenty of times when it keeps you out of a good trade. I'm happy for you to discuss and use any indicator you like as long as it makes you money. This is a thread about a particular system or maybe more a style of trading but it's not set in stone and even my ideas about things change over time even though the core system stays the same. I think you will find over time that you need the indicators less and less. If you look at the best trends it is possible to call the turns just using the heiken ashi. As long as your money management is correct then over time you will make money because when you loses you are losing maybe 100 or 150 pips (on h4 or dailies) and when you win you are winning 100, 200, 400+ per trade. Assuming you only win 40% of your trades you're still quids in. The probability call comes when you get a HA change somewhere near a s/r level in the direction of the main trend. Trendlines, stochs, cci, don't really improve your probability that much, it's the location and the direction that matter and then risking 1 or 2% per trade. Trailing your stop fairly loosely is what can make the difference between getting stopped out halfway through a good move or catching the majority of the move and that in itself will make a massive difference to your ongoing P+L.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
This "confirmation" thing is woolly thinking. If your basic criteria are met then take the trade. You will never be able to "filter out" all losing trades but stop being so afraid of losing trades. Accept that you will have losers and keep them small.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I'm not sure what you are basing that 2nd trendline on? It doesn't seem to connect anything? I would worry less about the trendline break on these trades, let the HA change and the stochs get you into these trades and then just put a stop loss just above the top of the last move or behind s/r or whatever.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I see what you mean at first glance re TL 2. Basically I draw a TL back from the low 4H bar when closed until it connects with the last major swing low point. (opposite for uptrend) This is what I call an outer TL, meaning there's nothing below it i.e another up trending TL for prices to run into. For me if prices pass thru both the low of the confirming 4H candle and the TL it can/may lead to a run to the downside....having said that prices have already moved some distance and therefore maybe some profits. The TL 1 is just looking at when prices start stalling and drawing a TL backwards from there. Sometimes dropping down onto the 1h Chart can help ID these areas well. Well, its time for me to go and do some gardening....(hate Gardening)..hope everyone has a great weekend, and thanks againg Hugh !! Cheers SR

Euraud +112, Eurjpy +16

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I've locked in 50 pips on Euraud to be on the safe side. I will take half profit at just above the last swing low at 1.2225. That will be nearly 200 pips. I will move Eurjpy to break even at 20 or 30 pips up, it's a more volatile pair and I don't want to lose my euraud gains on the other trade. Once I have no trades "at risk" then I can take another trade, according to my trading rules. I'll update later.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Eurjpy to BE. Nothing appeals at the 7am close of my brokers 4 hour candle so I'll wait til 11am. Audusd looks very interesting just below 1.05. Have to see what happens.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hugh, That trade above gives me confidence that your system works. Its simple, clean and very little in the way to misinterpret what your loking at. I know not every trade will be a winner, but the important thing for me is Im slowly getting to understand it, and trust it. Im travelling for work until tomorrow, but will check in to see how things unfold. If theres any newbies/lurkers out there please jump in and give comment, post charts as we all learn from everyones involvement. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thanks SR, I'm glad you think my system works Seriously though, you are right, it really is obvious when a trade SHOULD work out. You've just got to learn how to play it. The pips are there for the taking and for the losing. Once you start doing more of the first and less of the second then you've got it. Have a good day travelling.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Out at BE on eurjpy, looks like eurxxx are heading up for a bit. I'll hold euraud open as I have pips locked.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
hi hugh, any update regarding your smaller timeframe? your startegy is simple and effective

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes, here... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=314304 It's another nice simple system but you need time and patience to trade it. I laid out the system and then didn't carry it on due to other projects but it's a good system.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
thank you for sharing your knowledge hugh. hope this helps me to be in the right path and be successful in trading. thanks again

--- 帖子 #193 ---
GbpCad looking very interesting. Have to wait an hour for the candle close. Usdcad is heading down, stochs high and falling, Gbpusd is the same so Gbpcad SHOULD work out as a good sell opportunity.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I cant pull up any charts right now as Im checking in remotely. But I have to say, this system that Hugh has put forward can make $ if followed closely. Keep up the good work Hugh, as I know theres lots of good info here for people to make pips.. Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Thanks SR. Gbpcad opened and gone straight into profit. Let's see how this one works out.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I'm glad to have helped. If you need anything else just PM or post here.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Locked in 75 pips on euraud, like I said earlier all eurxxx pairs turning up so senseless to let more than that go.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
50 pip stop on gbpcad by the way.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Euraud stopped out +75 pips. Gbpcad floating around +20.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Gbpcad +32 pips so moved to break even. Nothing at risk now so I can watch for another trade.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Gbpcad floating between 50 and 60 pips up at the moment and at break even so going to leave it running. Nothing else appeals at the close of my brokers 4h candle so going to sit and watch.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Looking good Hugh

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thanks mate, piece of piss when you know how

--- 帖子 #204 ---
A little bit of sideways movement going on with the gbpcad trade but 38 or so pips up tonight. I'll leave it overnight and see how it looks in the morning. It's at break even so no big worries. Nothing else appeals tonight.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Gone a bit sideways overnight but no good reason to close it. I've attached a pic of gbpusd as well. On the face of it with the HA change and the stoch cross it might look like a good trade and it may well work out but I wouldn't want to sell it so close to the large 1.55 round number. These levels break as often as they hold but it's better probability not to trade directly into support or resistance. Also I'm already short a gbp pair, albeit at break even so I'm not desperate to be short gbp.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Another good example of that is audusd and audjpy. xxxusd do seem to be about to turn down and aud has had a good run up so for that reason I'm not interested in selling this right now. I'd like to see a good move down and then a smooth pullback and turn and then if everything is moving in the right direction and I get a smooth HA change and stoch cross then I'd sell. Both pairs move in a similar fashion so I'd only sell one at a time. I wouldn't be buying this anytime soon due to the possible turn in xxxusd, I want to be trading these when everything is going in the same direction. Last chart is audchf. I really like the look of the 0.97 level. The price seems to be moving really smoothly on this pair and although I think aud may start to fall a little against usd if chf starts to weaken this generally pushes xxxchf higher faster. I'm looking for a HA change and a smooth stoch cross to the upside and I'd be happy to be long with a stop just below the 0.97 level. That should be a relatively tight stop loss for a trade with such good upside potential.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I've got my eye on euraud again. Although it seems to be ranging for a little while it is trading very smoothly. I think eurusd and audusd may fall over the next few weeks but overall I am more bearish eur so I wouldn't be surprised to see another big drop in this pair and a HA change with a smooth stoch cross will see another short here.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Nothing appeals to trade this morning but there's a little watchlist building. I'll check in at 11am gmt. Hopefully SR is back today for another perspective?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hey Hugh... Back from Travels...will look over charts and make comments in what I see... Hope all is well on your end Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Hugh, THe GDP/USD chart mentioned is where I struggle. Maybe you an help. The way i see it is both the CCI 6 and Stoch have crossed, no question. However the uptrend TL isn't being tested ...yet. So the question is do we play a trade to the downside now or wait for the trend line to break. Any thoughts there ?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Yes, gbpusd doesn't look good probability at the moment. The indicators say one thing and I do think it will go down but I just couldn't be selling it. It just doesn't look right. That 1.55 is a good enough reason to stay out anyway.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Another way to explain it is to look at the integrity of the trend. It's pulled back a fair way so the downtrend doesn't look so strong now. The best way we can trade this information is just to think "gbp short" and then look for possible trades in gbpxxx.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Heres another thing i noticed while I was traveling....ie missed opportunities !! When the CCI / Stoch crosses it usually runs for a good couple of candles. How many ??? there's no guarantee but as Eelfranz and his TDI indicator suggests at least 3-8 candles. I don't have TDI so I use cci 6 which was suggested by Eelfranz instead. Even if you got in on every signal, (which I don't think you should..more on that later ), and got out with half your position after 2-3 candles, then bought your SL to BE and trailed the stop, or what ever method you chose to exit, would it make pips &gt;?? that's what im gonna look into... Also, just to be clear, Hugh's method of incorporating TL with Stochs and HA candles blends perfectly into this type of analysis...... Credit to Hugh and Eelfranz.. Heres a chart showing what I mean, its just the first example I picked , I think Hugh might be looking at it currently...... Just to be fair, im going to try and find a real narly one just to make it obvious that this isnt perfect, or anything not real world trading.... Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Have you tried it out on the trading simulator? Try it there first, use control points and the f12 button to go through candle by candle and take every trade that your indicators and the trend give you. You should make a profit. Then consider that we are using the direction of other pairs (sort of relative strength analysis) to pick the best trades and you'll see it's more profitable again.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Heres the crappy example I was talking about... Looking at it thou, its the sort of market that just doesn't look right...I know that sounds wishy washy, but look at the example above..see the difference...this is wheres Hugh's experience with TA , Big Numbers etc comes in to play ,something I need to pay more attention to.... Also, Im just looking at this/experimenting with this from a novices point of view... Any one who wants to add, please feel free... Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I need to look into using MT4 platform more....I guess in time Unfortunately Im using this platform which in my opinion is average, But Ive gotten use to it now. Hugh If you could run the simulator thingy ? on MT 4 ??? let us know what your thoughts are on this ?? That might be cool to explore the results. Dam, this is a tough game man....But I think were on to something here. Next Id like to talk/discuss how I draw Trend lines i.e TL1 and TL 2 for profit taking targets etc, something...which Im still learning, BUT have real significance to where to think about exiting a trade....

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I don't need to run it... I've done it already. Why trade a system if you don't know it works? There is information about drawing trendlines at the start of this thread.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Well...whats the verdict...?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Like I said, it turns a profit but traded in real time with information from relative strength etc it's even better. You should use the simulator yourself anyway to get a feel for what these trades look like as they unfold and then take a decision whether to take the trade or not. It's a fantastic learning tool.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Thanks for the heads up on that Hugh....can you PM me with the details, as we seem to be the only ones here doing the talking here. Man I have to get better with MT4...but it sucks for ease of use, once your familiar with another system...im ready to jump away and do my own thing.....and say adios to public forums....Think I have what I need to take next step, but, as no one is stepping in (other than yourself) to add to this forum.....maybe better to do studies alone...Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I think I sent you the details the other day? Just search forex factory for trading simulator and it's the first one in the list. There are people following along but as you say if noone is going to post then not much point continuing. I've found this before with forums, you can post a money making system but people either don't see it or just think that because it doesn't post 1000's of pips a day it's not worth it. Good luck with your trading and I'm glad to have been of some help along the way.

hi hugh, thanks for sharing great technique... hope i can learn more from you. today i follow your rules to trade GU.. it seem works.. please refer to image below... only... EU seem to be sideway... hope you gan share your tough at EU.. cheers..

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Looks like a good enough trade but what timeframe is it? I think xxxusd pairs are easing up slightly so be careful with that one. Actually, looking again you are trading against the trend.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
hi... aginst trend....? i dont know about that.... but the trade i took purely based on your technique.... as i write this... GU i s already up by 50 pip.... should i close the trade?... Tf is H4 for cs chart and H2 for HA.... shockingly... EU started to fall... see chart below... look like EU n GU not in the same direction.... it make me confuse..... please guide...

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Yes, gbpusd was moving up the page so when you sell it you are going against the trend. This need not be a big problem because if you look at the daily it looks as though it may be about to fall. If you're 50 pips up I would move the trade to break even and then watch the daily chart until the down move stops. Eu and gu don't always go the same direction. It increases the probability of a trade if everything is all going the same direction at the same time but it's no big deal if not.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
hi hugh, based on your explanation above, are you refer to daily chart to see the trend? correct me if im wrong... i really looking foward to learn this technique.. hopefully you can guide me. since this is the 1st time im using this... i will post a possible setup based on your method... hopefully you can guide and give opinion.... thanks...

I can see what you mean that the trend is overall down but it's not a very smooth trend in any direction. If you want to see an example of a good trend look at nzdusd 4 hour. That's the type of trend you want to trade. Keep posting and I'll keep replying. This is a money making system so take the time and give it a bit of practice and you'll be there.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
It's a little hard to see what's going on with the charts squeezed up together like that, can you post them seperately as bigger charts? Your trade ideas are not bad but they don't quite fit in with my system. The idea is that you find a trend and then trade moves back in the direction of the trend. You can use any timeframe to determine the trend as long as you realise that these trends are going to end sooner or later.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hi hugh, i will post seperate chart next time.... what im understand from your reply, your trade system to enter is after retrace? correct me if im wrong.. ... . regards.

update 2: both trade hit tp.... until now, still cant find heiken ashi setup on eu n gu... need to be patient... maybe tommorow.... nite...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You still long on that one Hugh ?...can you show chart to help me see what your seeing...Cheers

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I see what you mean. To be honest I dont really take to much notice of which way its moving as long as its below (above) the 0 line. I still use Stoch/TL for confirmation. I did get into this one later than I would have liked, but I was experimenting with prices break thru the recent candle lows vs just jumping straight in on the Candle open when cci/Stoch had crossed. For me im still trying to find the right balance.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
No, closed that out for more or less break even, it wasn't going anywhere.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
No worries, just wondered.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Any thoughts on this one ?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
It's countertrend but could work. I wouldn't take it myself, I always prefer to go with the trend but I'd never put anyone off a trade.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
morning hugh, this is what i see on eu... look like a good setup because: 1. stoch H2 already cross. 2. HA bar on H2 sign of turn. 3. cs on daily show pinbar and at H4. any tough on this one? thanks.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
update: eu sell post open at 1.3086.. tp target 50 pip...

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Down move for now seems a bit exhausted short term from what stochs are showing doesnt it...or do you not mind the possible drawdown???

--- 帖子 #252 ---
hi pmullin, thanks for the reminder... im taking this trade purely base on what i see on the chart with consideration of H2, H4 n daily time frame... im prepare to be wrong... (add one more experince to me).. thanks again.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Out with 30 pip loss.....

--- 帖子 #254 ---
MrLuckystar... Again it is AGAINST THE TREND. The trend is obviously moving up, why sell it? Only buy into uptrends and sell into downtrends. If you need a visual reminder for this put a 100 sma on the chart and only buy when the price is above it and only sell when the price is below it. I would never put anyone off a trade, it might work out, but think about probability. A trend will PROBABLY continue. Trends in forex tend to continue more than they completely reverse. Saying that the daily trend is down so if you are trading 4 hour charts you have to decide when the 4 hour uptrend is over and the daily downtrend will resume. The time to be taking trades is when the 4 hour trend is moving in the same direction as the daily trend. This equals high probability. Consider the euraud trade I took last week, the 4 hour swung back in the direction of the daily trend. SR, bummer, I didn't like the look of it but I could just as easily have been wrong. Read above, it's a probability thing.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I didn't want to get too indepth and derail your thread or anything but very nicely put and my thoughts exactly as far as how I look at it...

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Yes Hugh your right. Im still looking at indicators (cci and Stochs ) to much, vs looking at the overall trend and PA This is where have discretion comes into play not just blindly looking at indicators. I was really hoping to have a more mechanical approach, using indicators to help make the decision but this has to change. hes a chart what Im looking at considering going long with the up trend. The problem here thou is the indi's show a short trade but the trend is still up...so ignore cci and Stochs ?...:{ SR

--- 帖子 #257 ---
however same chart on the 1H. Interesting indis pointing in same direction of overall trend....

--- 帖子 #258 ---
And perspective on M15...

--- 帖子 #259 ---
So given the above scenarios, maybe look for PA to reach a TL on the 4 H chart. Drop down to either 1H or M15 and using Stochs/CCI when they cross in same direction as 4H trend initiate the trade... Any thoughts there Hugh ...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
hi hugh, this is the guide i need from experience trader... close trade on eu with -30pip... i already put sma 100 at H4 chart... the price is above the line... up trend (will remember this)... looking for setup to open buy trade... thanks...

--- 帖子 #261 ---
hi hugh, i see setup buy at gu... buy stop at 1.5716... any opinion is appreciated... regards.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
update: gu open buy at 1.5716.... target tp is 50 pip.. update1: eu open at 1.3131.. tp 50 pip..

--- 帖子 #263 ---
No problem at all, you are welcome to post anytime. (particularly if you agree with me. LOL)

--- 帖子 #264 ---
No, don't ignore the cci and stochs, just don't even consider the long trade until the cci and stochs agree with the trend. You want to be long this pair because it is trending up. No problem, just wait until you get a bullish candle that is backed up by your indicators. I have something in the pipeline that could take away most of these issues. I have been looking into trading renko charts for a while (search them on FF) and I think I have some rules developed that could be profitable over the long term. I'll continue to refine them and when I have something close to where I want it I will post on a new thread.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
That's a method that a lot of people use. It is very marginally lower probability than just using one timeframe to signal your trade but it does get you in earlier if the trend is about to resume. It's a trade off between getting in earlier into a trend and not being blown about by false moves on lower tf's.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I wouldn't put you off either of those trades, I think they have the potential to work out. Why are you using a 50 pip tp? What if the trade goes 200? I think you are using a 50 pip stop loss as well right? If that is the case then there is nothing wrong with a 1:1 risk to reward as the probability of these entries is quite good but I prefer to let these trades run as far as they can. That's the big benefit to using heiken ashi candles. Good luck with your trades.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
hi hugh, could you eleborate more on "have the potential to work out"... my broker dont have trailing stop.... im using android (galaxy note) to trade... that y i keep at 1:1 ratio... regards...

--- 帖子 #268 ---
That just means I think you will make money on those trades.

--- 帖子 #269 ---

--- 帖子 #272 ---
One win and one loss, can't complain. A 100 pip stop loss would have kept you in the trade you lost. 50 pips on gbpusd is a little tight. Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
It seems as though the up move is now totally exhausted and market might make one final push up with the sunday gap but may sharply reverse as price is hitting critical points on the higher time frames as far as support/resistance or tops/bottoms whatever one wishes to call it...but according to this strategy I suppose that one would have to wait for the down move to establish itself before jumping on board...but daily stochastic seems to have topped off at these critical points on eu gu au nu....of course I do still have a bullish sentiment for these pairs and think ultimately they will end up rising but I think that the daily stochastic needs to drop in the form of a retracement on the higher time frames in order for price to continue to go up...lol but who knows I could be wrong... What are your thoughts Hugh ...???

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Well I try not to form opinions about what's going to happen next as I have a habit of being wrong! I would say that for a while now the general direction for xxxusd pairs has been down and eurusd and gbpusd do seem to have had a good pullback. Audusd and nzdusd are rocketing up the page with no sign of stopping. Usdxxx is acting in a similar fashion so we can tell it is a weak dollar that is pushing all this along. The only question is when is USD going to kick back in and start pushing these pairs back with the overall trend, if at all? I'm happy to continue selling the USD (ie buying xxxusd) until I get a good reason not to and I'm not sure the upwards correction is over yet but I do still see it as a correction and not a trend change. The daily trend aside it is still possible to take pips from these 4 hour trends. Just remember that sooner or later the 4 hour trends will put in some sideways range before the resumption of the daily trend. Not being caught out in ranging markets is every trend traders main aim.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Very nice response...hmmm...I would have to say I wasn't looking for an opinion as much as just getting an idea of your perspective/just curious as to how you view the markets and such as I do know the subjective nature of the markets and these charts and all... but nonetheless...as expected..a very stimulating response...

My new renko trading journal is here... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=339136

--- 帖子 #277 ---
hi hugh, is this mean that you will using renko chart instead of heiken ashi to decide an entry? or you will use both? any different between this 2 chart? any pro n con? thanks...

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi, I will be using both, in slightly different systems. The renko is really good for trading s/r breakouts and heiken ashi is really good for trend changes. Big differences between the two. One is based on time and the other is based on price. Read the other thread for more info.

--- 帖子 #279 ---

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Please post your trades taken for the last week and the profit or loss for each. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
as requested.... this is my trade summary using your method...

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Well that sure looks good to me, maybe there is something in the 50/50 approach? Maybe you could continue as you are and post your results every week? That would be great.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Euraud gave about 120 pips profit but is slowing down a little now.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Currently in this one....demo of course

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I've never liked the idea of taking part profits on trades because when you lose you lose your full risk so when you win why take half profit? However maybe with this system it makes sense to take some profit when you get to 50 pips and then let the other half run at break even? Looking at mrluckystars results above it seems there is a good probability of these trades reaching at least 50 pips. I think it is worth trying this out and reporting results.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Is that on the 4H charts Hugh ?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Out....+47

--- 帖子 #299 ---
What the euraud? Yes Or do you mean the 50 pip tp and sl? Yes, 4 hour. I usually prefer trading dailies but 4 hour charts do seem to give some good signals too.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Nice trade.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
hi hugh, found setup at au and eu... any comment are welcome... this is chart au..

--- 帖子 #302 ---
and this is chart for eu..

both trade open... eu open at 1.3093... au open at 1.6045.. target tp... 50 pip..

--- 帖子 #304 ---
They look like possible trades but be careful because the trend does seem to be slowing a little.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
noted hugh... once it reach +25pip.. i will make it BE... today nfp news... need extra becareful...

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Usdcad may be ready for another push down? Another hour and 15 minutes until my 4h candle close so I'll just keep an eye on it.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
update 1: both pair currently +30pip... move sl ti BE.... cheers..

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I sold usdchf instead, similar setup but cadchf looks a bit bearish so went with the chf.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
update2: both trade hit tp... +100pip... regards

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Keep going Mr L!!! Usdchf moved to BE +40 pips.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
thanks hugh... credit to you.... big news comming in.... enough for me today.... nite...

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Banked 50 pips on usdchf. Got cadchf short and audusd long both at BE with 50 pip target.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Cadchf and audusd trades closed out at BE (or +1 on each). 52 pips banked for the day. Nothing looking right this evening so I'll look again in the morning. Everything seems to be quite extended at the moment and we need a good smooth pullback before we can get involved.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Bit of a long term trade here for you. Could be a few months! Eurnzd. First pic is monthly, then weekly, then daily. You can see what nice long runs this pair puts in, reasonably smooth heiken ashi. So I've sold it. The stop loss is just over 200 pips away behind a round number. Let's see how far it goes.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
A bit shorter term, here's euraud. I've taken the trade on the 30 min chart because 4 hour looks undecided but I think there is 50 pips in this.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thinking of a short entry here.....Thoughts Hugh ?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Yes, looks as though it could work. It's with the immediate trend.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Are you thinking of going with a 50/50 trade or letting it run?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
On other thoughts with trend lines redrawn.....looks like PA has broken above the Down trend line on the 4 H Chart

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Heres that chart on the 1H....Not sure now what to make of it...will wait I think...What do you make of it hugh ?? Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #321 ---
hi hugh... ej price is above 100sma line on H4 chart... if sell, look like against the trend... any comment are welcome..

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Short on demo EJ on 4H chart as originally planned. SL is about 70 pips away..have to keep practicing to get better

--- 帖子 #323 ---
EJ Chart...comments welcome

--- 帖子 #324 ---
SR, Mr L has it right, the 4 hour chart does look as though it is trending down (the IMMEDIATE trend is down) but the 100 sma on the chart would tell you it's still technically in an uptrend and so possibly best to leave. It is a difficult thing to call but the 100 sma rule will keep you out of trouble more often than not. Saying all this though a short may work, eur pairs do seem to be falling. It's a probability thing though, best to always trade in the same direction as the 100 sma is moving.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
well explain... thanks for remind me again... i knew that you will be great mentor.. credit to you hugh....

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Eurnzd +62 and euraud +36. I also sold eurgbp at 11 am (my brokers 4 hour candle close) and now +14. Sorry I didn't get a chance to post the trade before it happened and screen shots.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
ermmm... looks like au n eu going to fly... but... stoch did not cross yet.... patient... patient.... hurmmmmm....

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yep, looking likely, maybe tomorrow afternoon after nfp? Eurgbp stopped out +1.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
a pretty decent set up on the usd chf...could have caught off the thirty minute with the hour stoch in line with the 30...and bouncing off a four hour bearish trend line...is anybody in...??? same on usd cad...

--- 帖子 #330 ---
gbp close to touching a 60m/240m trend line and will just need stochs to turn up on 60m to get in...but its about 10 pips away from touching the trend line and looks like it may not...but now I actually zoomed out and drew a different trend line and price on gbp usd is bouncing right at it now...

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Euraud stopped +1 and sold eurchf. One of these eur trades is going to work out! Eurnzd going ok though, the longer term trade. Not sure about gbpusd, 4 hour stochs are pretty high and turning down. It could work though?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
hi hugh, found setup at eu.... buy stop at 1.3218...

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Looks like you were right Hugh Mr L...a 33 pip loss on that trade...oh well back to the board again...

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Could work out. Your trades usually do!

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Keep going, it's a trend thing. Try a 100 sma on the chart and only trade in the same direction.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
buy stop did not open.... maintain as it is... as hugh said... maybe after nfp....

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hi hugh, this is my opinion on the eu based on bigger tf... on daily chart... 1. trend is down because price is below sma. 2. stoch already cross. 3. HA already have signal turning. by loooking at daily... its waiting time to tank down... on cs chart already have inside bar setup... i rekon if break down this setup... it will go down... i dont play with daily chart coz i think it require huge amount of SL... im more on intraday trader... that why im always check H4 TF... so far a small amount of SL (50pip) is require... my bias for eu still up... until H4 price cross 100sma... once price cross 100sma on H4... my bias will change supported by daily chart.. any comment or opinion are welcome... regards.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
hi hugh, found setup at gu.... post open at 1.5814.... target tp is 50 pip...

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi... Im with u [/quote] hi saffia.. please take note that today is big day where nfp will comeout.. please take care of ur money management... market will be slow until the big news came out...

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I agree with the eurusd analysis. First though remember that everything will pretty much go sideways until after nfp. Things should settle down for the 4 hour candle close after that so we can probably take a trade. Don't forget also that gbp and eur are correlated at least to some extent. Trading daily charts needs around a 200 pip stop which sounds a lot but obviously you will have a reduced position size and the gains will be much higher. Trailing the stop properly can keep you in for 500 to 2000 pip moves. It's just a question of patience. I think the 50/50 approach on 4 hour (or 2 hour) charts seems to be working fine.

--- 帖子 #342 ---

Maybe the stochs are already a little too high? To continue up it needs to break another level of resistance. It may do this or it may not.

Mr L are you using 2H charts for spotting trades ?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
From the screen shots I believe so.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
SR and Mr L, you two and I are the main contributors to this thread. The system described at the beginning of the thread has changed a little, there are some new ideas regarding how to take trades and money management. Do you think I should start a new thread explaining the current system better from the start and then we can all contribute further ideas there? Or do you think we should just keep this one and I can update the first post to point to a post with a new explanation of the system there?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
yes it looks like it....Is that what you mean by 50/50 ? I noticed there were some trades heree recently also that were BE so I decided to relook at tyhe trade I took the 33 pip loss on. Ive added the 100 sma. It still looked like it was going down in the immediate TF I was following. Also, I gave up about 33 pips before it reversed and Stopped me out for a loss. I suppose in hindsight, the trade did go as I had thought, but was poorly managed. I should consider taking quicker profits say at 25 pips, consider move SL to BE and let the rest run.... Heres the updated chart, sorry its a bit congested. There were a few other crosses of CCI/Stoch but not all worked out. Im still trying to work out how to impliment this system.... SR

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I meant 50/50 as in 50 take profit and 50 stop loss. Yes, the trendline was down on the tf you were looking at, in that case it's just one of those things. I have been moving to +1 pip after 25 pips and had one winner for +50 and about 5 stopped out at +1 which is frustrating but when you consider that I have had no losses it is pretty good. Maybe this week has been a little unpredictable or maybe the signal we are following is good for 25 pips more often than not and 50 pips only sometimes? In my head I still like the idea of trailing the stop behind a long move and getting an outstanding risk/reward but I do also like the idea of a 1:1 r/r and a getting in and out with a high probability quick profit. I'm all for testing both approaches on a simulator and forward testing on demo or small live account and see which is most profitable.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Thats a good call there Hugh. I think Ill take another look at my trade selection, look to get out at 25 pips, SL to BE and trail ? accordingly....see how that goes

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I sent you a PM about this...

--- 帖子 #357 ---
hi sjr... if you notice... im always post 2 chart.... chart 1. heiken ashi (HA) chart..... im using 2 hour tf for this chart... reason.. i want to get faster singnal for my entry (instead wait 4 hrs bar to close, im waiting for 2 hrs only).... at this chart i need confirmation of stoch cross and HA bar signal of turning... chart 2. candlestick chart.... im using 4 hoir for this chart... this chart determine the trend (100sma rule) and... here i also can see reliable setup of cs such as inside bar setup, fakey inside bar setup and pin bar... so far... this 2 chart are reliable to me.... any comment and opinion are welcome... regards.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I'll try and run some different ideas through the simulator this weekend and see what comes up. The trouble is I will probably have to do it tick by tick which is very slow and cumbersome. I think some forward testing will have to be done and good recording and analysis of the results will give us the answer.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I like the 2 chart approach and the 2 hour tf does get you in quicker and so far doesn't seem to impact probability too much. Please keep going and posting charts Mr L, your input is very welcome.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
update2: stop out at +12pip... dont want to carry over weekend.... a tough day of trading..... nfp of course....

--- 帖子 #145 ---
thanks hugh, your guide are most important.... cheers..

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Thx Mr. L. Ill take alook at this also, Its a novel idea to Hughs original Trading plan. It makes sense on one hand, ie getting earlier on the 2H, and backing it up using PA and 100 sma on the 4h....following the trend. Maybe that will help keep me out of trades going against the trend, and not just following blindly what the indicators are saying... Cheers SR

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Yes, lots of sideways going on, even after the news. By the way, my eurnzd long term short is +60 pips this evening. Going to keep it open. It was over 100 pips up earlier but that's the way it goes.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
nice trading.... bravo....

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...20#post5354620 New thread here.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
new thread is for H4, is this method still viable on D1, or do you recommend the other on h4? also i read somewhere that you were looking for weekly stochs at extremes and then trading off of H4, is this still a working possibility? thx

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Both threads would work on either timeframe, the most up to date information is in the other thread as it is more active. The weekly stoch idea is over there too.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Everybody, This is my first post on this forum. Hugh, at first I would like to say thank you for your advices and thanks a lot for sharing your strategy. I haven't read the forum in details yet, but I think I understand the main rules. But I think the practice is the best teacher, so I would like to know your opinion about the following situations: This is a daily chart for EURGBP. The Stochastic crossed the 20 level from under, and the second candle closed in raising. The candle is above the 100 MA, so I think it would be a good entry opportunity for BUY. What do you think? http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...6&amp;d=1349212475 The second picture is about EURUSD daily chart. The situation is similar, but there is only one candle yet. I think I should open a BUY position. Do you aggree? http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...7&amp;d=1349212475 Thank you very much for your help! Regards
