Trendlines are significant in any timeframe. 3 touches of any trendline and subsequent breakout should see a retest of the breakout and then the start of another trend. As of current time, eurusd on the 60 min sees possibility of a trend (in the 30 min timeframe) upwards from current levels. Now that the 60 m trend is up how do we play it? 1 Enter on retrace to the breakout level or just above it 2 Enter 1/2 position now, then scale in when the market retraces to the breakout point. 3 Trading trends the stop loss should be larger 100 ticks and over. Just make sure $ risk is 2% of trading account. Aggressive traders can take positions 1 standard lot (100k) per 10K in the account. 4 The 18 simple moving average provide the risk parameters for the trade. If 2 whole candles close below this then it is time to exit. Let's see how it pans out...

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Pullback in eurusd provides the opportunity to get long.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
ok, the eurusd has made its retracement, so the entry point can be anywhere between 1.3550 to 1.3590. Remember this is a trend trade, so the precision of the entry point is not as relevant.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Eurusd has reached a high of 1.3680. Simetimes trading is not rocket science.... Any comments/discussion welcome.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
How far does it have to retrace before you consider it a trade?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
After a valid breakout of the trendline, the price should come back to retest the breakout price level or just above it. Note that the long trade is still valid, unless the stop is hit or there are two bars below the 18 sma line. That will be the condition to exit. Remember that we are trading this 60 min trend. For trend trading there needs to be a lot more room given. Have to knock off to bed now.(2am here) See you on Monday. Cheers

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Great trades. I consider trendline as pure price action trading. How do you determine the take profit targets?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
As one trader once told me, "Entries are dime a dozen and easy to execute, but the real money is made in the exit" Since this is a trend trade (in the 60 min timeframe) we utilise a trailing stop using the 18 sma. 2 bars closing entirely below this sma indicates an exit. That way one can 'ride the trend'. But, it doesn't preclude you to take partial profits at 'psych levels' the 00s 50s etc... dependent on trade plan. Cheers PS I am expecting 1.3800 as a good level to close the trade...

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Now that the eurusd trade is in play, (hopefully it follows through) the next one could be cable (gbpusd). While eurusd was going up, cable dropped, watch the downtrend line...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
On the daily TF price maybe retrace back to the trendline - for a good long entry

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hmmm...It seems to be quite interesting. I will definitely check, whether it really works.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Another great trade opportunity. My first target is EMA200 @ 1,0651

--- 帖子 #13 ---
On daily chart trend is broken. But i think price will retrace back to trendline for another short entry :-)

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Dondoggy Thanks for the charts. Daily timeframe, of course is more reliable, but entail bigger stop loss.... but less whipsaw. But keep the trendline charts coming...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Cable 60 min chart, still a fair way away from the down trendline. However there is a daily gap + divergence... could be a good level for trade long (1.5000) but ensure the stop is in place according to your $ management.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Without 2 closes below the 18 sma of the eurusd, the trend is still intact...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Looking like the long position needs to be exited soon.... according to the plan.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Possible trade to the downside if retracement towards the breakdown point materializes...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
The retracement takes eurusd back to the breakdown point, shorting into this area could be fruitful...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Cable 60 min chart, watching this trendline.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
EURUSD hourly chart update, into the downtrend, hoping it can develop further.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
EURUSD downtrend got to as low of 1.3434. Right now is on another TL breakout, so we'd focus on longs after the hourly candle closed above the downtrend line.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Cable 60 min chart update, failed downside break, now consolidating sideways.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
We had a high print of 1.3595 for eurusd....

--- 帖子 #25 ---
A selloff after the US equity session open provided entry into the trend for eurusd.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
sorry for being a lil bit slow but what does "high print" mean technically? thanks in advance Regards Ali

--- 帖子 #27 ---
There's no such thing as a stupid question... Means high price quoted. In the old days of stock markets, the prices came over in ticker tape. Prices were printed onto rolling tape, hence if the trade was done at the high, hence the word 'high print'

--- 帖子 #28 ---
EURUSD 60 min trend has been up since the trendline break last night...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
GBPUSD, watching the trendline....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
eurusd trend is still up, but there is an uptrend line now...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Cable, classic breakout of TL retrace to retest and go again... Will Sterling Yen do the same? Dailyfx seem to think so..

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Price found support @ 1,344 and trendline is broken. i Think we will see a bullish move next days.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
can anybody tell me if their is a charting what can show me the degree of a trend line

--- 帖子 #34 ---
eurusd and gbpusd 60 min charts, the trend is developing well...

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Not too sure about that.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
eurusd the last hourly candle has crossed the trendline... Focussing on shorts.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Bias on 60 min timeframe is still down, governed by the downward sloping trend line...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
The downtrend in eurusd is developing, so this trendline break was a valid one..

--- 帖子 #39 ---
The 5 min trendline break can be used to time entry, given the short bias.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
in mt4 platform, select Insert/Lines/Trendline by Angle cheers HR

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Eurusd falls nicely on its downward trend. Gbpusd has just started....

--- 帖子 #42 ---
OK, after NFP release, we have a low print of 1.3531 and 1.4998 for EU and GU...

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi emacro, For the entry, do we have to wait until it retraces? According to your experience, what do you think of taking position when the trendline is broken? (will it be too risky?) Regards, bun888

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Cable rebounds through a new trendline.... Jim Rogers who predicted " The pound will collapse within weeks " will have some sleepless nights this weekend.... We need more of these billionaires to share his dough around... I actually want to highlight and emphasize to treat such expert oinion in the popular media or cnbc or bloomberg tv as entertainment, no more no less. As Dr Alexander Elder says, "The popular media only reports on stuff that they more or less 100% certain to be true" In this case the huge move in cable downwards. They are news organisations and are in the business of being 'right'. Hence they always report on a commodity or instrument at advanced stages or exhaustion pahse of the move.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
In my opinion, the entry depends on your individual trade plan, which reflects your personality. If you decide to enter on break of the TL without a 'close' of the 60 min candle, just bear in mind it can reverse before following through. I like to let the candle close then enter on retracement. In the 60m timeframe, we are expecting a larger 'trend' to develop, so it is ok to enter late i guess.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I understand. Yes, I figured that a decision should be made after the candle close. In your experience, is it possible for a trendline to be broken and the next candle came back to the previously broken trendline?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes, that happens. There are situations where the candle pokes through the TL and the very same candle closes below. That is also a signal to go the other way... Remember that markets don't go straight up or down. Inevitably after the breakout and close above/below a TL there is some sort of retracement.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I see. Where would you normally put the stop loss? Is it several (could be 20, 30, 50,etc) pips below the bottom or top candle of the retracement?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hourly Trendlines breaks, sees eurusd and cable now on upside trend...

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Into the US session, the uptrend is still intact for both eurusd and gbpusd, in the 60 min timeframe..

--- 帖子 #51 ---
The trend as of the last trendline breaks is now down for eu and gu.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
How do you know that trend started after a consolidation and that it is not a busted breakout?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Actually when te trend started and when it ends will only become apparent after the whole trend is finished. In this case we are assuming a break of the trendline.(preferably 3 touches) However whether the trend continues no one knows, only time will tell.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Orderly declines in the 60 min timeframe for eurusd and cable to lows of 1.3547 and 1.4945.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Range bound trade, we can watch the horizontal lines for the breakouts.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Update on the horizontal channels, some breaks today, but no follow through for both on downside, seems eurusd is on an upside breakout now.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Cash Nasdaq 100 (NDX) index breaks out of the previous high, we'd expect a pullback to get long...

--- 帖子 #58 ---
One more touch of the trendline on eurusd, then a potential for long breakout...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
OK the last 60 min bar in eurusd has closed in a breakout of the trendline, gbpusd supports with its own breakout of the horiz resistance trendline.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
OK, the breakout for both eurusd and cable is underway into the new 60 min trend...

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Taking a view on cash NDX (post #57 ), the gap down in NQ futures down to 1910 provided an opportunity to go long...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
NQ futures 1 min chart, a nice move up...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Eurusd and gbpusd is on their 60 min trend up, since the breakout of the trendlines yesterday...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I offer the following by way of critique of commonly held TA assumptions that everybody takes for granted and not as a critique of your efforts. Please carry on. Common TA assumptions should be scrutinized by anybody who wants to trade with the probabilities. Ask the following question, how can 2 or 3 data points determine a trend? What about all the other data points - are they less significant than the ones that are cherry picked for trend line drawing? How about another question, why must a trend line be a straight line? There are lots of other basic TA assumptions that need to be revisited. Many of them are detailed in the post linked below. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...58&amp;postcount=3

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Revisiting the NQ futures, here is a 30 min view.... The trade on the gap down yesterday would be the long as the better choice.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thank you for the comments. You have very valid points that all should take note of. If one is talking on pure mechanical systems then significance or non significance of data points or indicators etc definitely are clouded. However TA is like art more than science, there is naother element... the trader who makes the interpretation of the chart. Agreed? But once agian appreciate your critique.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi emacro, I like the simplicity of the trendline. By the way, USD/JPY 1H chart is showing a nice trendline. If you look at the daily chart, it's just in the middle of upward movement. So I'm not sure if it can make a good breakout or turns out to be just a consolidation until US Retail Sales data is released. It could be a false breakout, but anything can happen. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Far East Man I just took a look at usdjpy, I guess you could draw the trendline as in the screenshot. But in hindsight.... The art is to draw it in advance. Hey sorry about this, but this chart seems to be the wrong chart. Charting application is in error. Actually usdjpy is one that I don't follow, simply because of its 'cramped' nature. So apologies.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I'm not sure which part of the chart your screen shot is showing. Mine is USD/JPY Hourly chart. I think either upward or downward break may make an interesting move. Only the market knows though.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Apologies, my charting app was in error for some reason. Sounds good, your analysis of the situation, I concur...

--- 帖子 #71 ---
No worries, mate! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi emacro I follow your thread and I actually use a similar method. I want to ask you if you have statistics about the % of winning trades and the size of the move divided by the syze of you stoploss(the R:R ratio)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Well, we have the parabolic move in eurusd... Not quite to 1.3800 but this trend developed well.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Sorry no statistics, how about you?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hey Far East Man The Usdjpy is now on the 60 min downtrend... Are you from oz?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi emarco, I'm from Japan. Yep, it went down. I actually took a short position by placing a sell stop below the trendline, but already closed it with a small profit. I simply didn't want to hold it longer. Currently, other majors are going up. If this overall move continues, then Yen, a risk-aversion currency, may become weaker, eventually pushing USD/JPY higher later on. I can't tell if this happens or not, really. We'll have to see US Retail Sales data, maybe. Maybe I would regret closing the position too early later on, but it's always good to exit with a profit than a loss especially when you are not confident about the position. I'll look for another one when there is a clearer indication of a trend or a breakout of a trend. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #77 ---
To complete the picture for the week. These are the trends that one wants to be on board.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
....like the big hitters Soros and Rogers,....there is nobody left to buy the US Dollar. This week we will lay off the 'Jim Rogers' bashing... The dailyfx.com report entitled " US dollar at risk for further weakness v euro on FX positioning." The most poignant wording in this report are: "In recent months we have argued that the US Dollar was likely to recover against the Euro and other key counterparts on extremely one-sided bearish positioning and sentiment. Yet the tables have clearly turned in the Dollar’s favor; CFTC Commitment of Traders data shows Non-Commercials at a record net-long the US currency against the Euro. Such one-sided USD-bullish positioning has made it extremely difficult for the currency to eke out further gains. Indeed, a further unwind would almost certainly bring EURUSD rallies."

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Yeah, emacro, actually EUR/USD is now at the verge of an interesting point on daily chart. It'll be either temporarily pullback or a gain after an oversold area on a daily chart (see the chart). On the hourly chart, it will be interesting if EUR/USD made a pullback to the previous swing high and start gaining momentum again. I'll probably ride on it if I have a chance.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
We are looking at the resistance trend lines, that may see breakout. Right now cable has broken out and pulling back...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
So now the trendlines becomes strong resistance. One would have been stopped on anticipation of any cable breakout though...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
3 touches of the trendline makes it have more significance...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi emacro, I think AUD/USD is looking interesting right now on 1H chart. I like breakouts, but I like them more when they are in accordance with the direction of bigger trend. I have personally set a buy triggger above the 1H swing high with a stop loss below the 1H swing low. Cheers, Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Cable on third test of trendline. However the markets are congesting ahead of fomc.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Thanks for the input, always good to hear from other trendliners. Do you use higher TF to determine trend eg 4hr or daily?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yea, I take a quick glance of Daily and 4H, or simply zoom out 1H chart to get a larger view. Diagonal lines are great. They allow you to catch a bouncing point or a turning point.

A bit of patience and we see valid trendline breaks for eurusd and cable...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
The hourly trend for cable and eurusd has made progress to upside, since the breakout yesterday...

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi emacro, Look at Cable. On the 4H chart below, it has broken the trendline upward. Some people may be a bit long-biased right now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also, look at the 1H chart. It has made an interesting hook and the lower tip of the hook touches the high of the previous swing move. So the upward breakout may make an interesting move. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Gbp fuutres on m5

--- 帖子 #101 ---
He hasn't clearly mentioned about how many pips the price actually has to pass over the line. He waits for the price to retrace back to the breakout point to place an entry, so the amount of price buffer may not be a big issue for him. Although I personally tend to enter on an initial breakout, the advantage of emacro's strategy is that he doesn't pick the initial breakout, and just let the market breath and wait for a pull back so that you can safely enter into a trade after identifying a real breakout has occurred or not. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Have been thoroughly enjoying this site. Was wondering why MACD histogram only is used instead of the complementary slow and fast moving average lines also? As oftentimes, divergence may appear on one and not the other? Good investing!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Glad you are enjoying the read... Macd histogram helps give an indication of the momentum. If present then it helps if not, then the momentum is not behind the trade. That still doesn't mean things won't work out. Feel free to contribute to the discussion.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Basically this is a discretionary method, no hard and fast rule. If you notice in the last m5 cable example, the candle that pierced the trendline was a big one. That is also a contributing factor. The main point is to have your trade strategy and plan set out. Whether to do like Far East Man, jump in on penetration or to enter on retrace, that depends on your trade plan, which will reflect your personality.(hopefully) Cheers

--- 帖子 #105 ---

Before anyone asks, the green and white bars represent when momentum and inertia of the market in that timeframe are pointing in the same direction: Momentum=MACD Histogram standard settings Inertia=13 ema This is Dr Elder's 'Impulse Momentum' system in his book, "Come into my trading room".

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks for the encouragement. I was thinking might wrap up the thread here, make it short and sweet. One problem I found with some threads is they are very very long, not easy for new traders to read...

On EUR/USD 1H chart, the trendline has been breached, and now it's back to the breakout point. Will you take this one, emacro? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Far East Man Thanks for the heads up. I am ony just starting today to look at the charts. I'd wait for the Macd histogram to hook up then can go long eurusd. By the time it hook up, momentum is in your favour (at least) and the level you enter might just end up being approx what you enter by catching the falling knife. But if you want to enter on the retrace to the pullback level, it is still ok, as long the risk management stop you can stomach.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
This candle might see the macd histogram hook up for the entry...

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thank you for your reply, emacro! Yea, I tend to jump in. When it works it works without indicators. But nobody knows future. I just like to take it simple. Besides, I use a tiny experimental micro account risking only 2%. So there's nothing to worry about. That said, I think your way of trading is good.

Can you also trade this system using the 15min chart or is it more effective in the 60min chart?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
It's just trendline breaks, support and resistance points being broken. I guess you can use 15 min as trigger, but 5 min is good to trigger the trade, once the 60 min shows heads up. For example, today the 60 min showed a divergence, which as Dr Alexander Elder describes, "The most powerful signal in technical analysis..."

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Completing the picture with the eurusd 5m chart

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thanks for the reply. So you can go down to lower level charts to trigger the trade? Further, can we use the trendline breakout using the 15 min charts? I mean, we draw trendlines on the 15 min chart, not the 60 mins, and enter trade when the trendlines were broken.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Last post for this week. There you go, a 15 min chart of cable.

thanx for all this information,trendline can be best indicator of all to see where market is heading. Ali

--- 帖子 #154 ---
trend lines can be more and more powerful when its a bigger time frams like 4 hr,less then that can give many false signals.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Thanks for the comments. 1 hr is also ok, as long as there are more than 3 touches that bounce off it. I guess trendlines have turned the light bulb on for you as well. Cheers

As with all facets related to trading, one must balance tradeoffs between risk and reward. If you jump in without waiting for retest then your risk is greater and reward commensurate. A retest trade will make the risk lower but the momentum may have waned resulting in lass rewarding gain. With daily charts though as in last week's eurjpy trade there is ample time to make the decision. How you choose to trade depends on your own personality, risk tolerance etc and your trading plan. Cheers

Well, another tl break on the 60 min eurjpy. This divergence (60 min few days ago) trade is really 'the most powerful signal in tech analysis.... couple that with the daily inverted H&amp;S....

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks, that's the best advice I've heard all day.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Yes, it was very deep.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Nice thread on trendlines emacro. Does raise a few questions on your mehtodolgy but I'll start with just a quick one. After the TL break, do you have a set time for the retracement to form? For example, is the next bar after the close below counted as a valid retrace or is it considered too early. Conversely, is there an extended period of time, say 12 bars, after the break that you would not consider taking the retrace trade. Thanks in advance and keep posting the charts. Very interesting. G-Man

--- 帖子 #182 ---
After the breakout, we assume the resistance now becomes support. So there is no time limit, although some would argue that the longer the elapsed time, the less valid the new support is. Sometimes, the faster the retrace the faster the move off the s/r level and vice versa, as per Newton's laws of motion.... Cryptic I know but trading and chart reading is more art than science. Cheers

Hi Emacro, What our your rules for the 5min trendline breaks.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
In the first post. Bear in mind that there is a bit of discretion to use these shorter time frame tl breaks. We need the bigger picture eg divergence, or trendline break in the 60 min or daily, then drilling down to 5 min, 12 min or lower timeframe, one can look for trendline breaks to enter in the direction on bigger tf. You can also dispense with these shorter timeframes and just trade off 60 min. In short, look for a bias or direction on bigger tf, then drill down to 5 min for the tl break to enter.(and try to trade in direction of momentum, green and white bars which is just the ema/macd histogram pointing in the same direction)

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hey emacro! I've just found out about your thread on BO trading! Great thread! and I was looking for a thread just like this! well, if you don't mind, I would like to post my charts and thoughts here... so, my first chart on Eur/USD on 15 min chart!

I just love to long usdchf, when shorting eurusd....

Remember it's more grey than black or white, as it is discretionary. Hence there is no hard and fast data on win% etc, because it is not mechanical.

Best of luck and inform forumers how it goes.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Ya breakout of a valid trendline is a part of it. Oher considerations are trend, divergence etc on higher timeframes, that may support the direction of the breakout. I think for eurusd not I'd wait for some divergence, then look for a breakout long.

Do you like the look of chfjpy, 4 hour chart? That's a sell stop by the way.

Sorry this is the correct 4 hr chfjpy.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I see. I do prefer to trade these when the daily shows a break zoom to the 4 hour for the pullback. I would never look at the 4 hour that close up. Maybe that break you show would have pulled back on the hourly?

Great trading! Remember fractals. I think most charts in whatever timeframe look similar, with the same patterns of tl break. Anyway well done again. Please post more 4 hour charts.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Thanks. I realised yesterday after I posted that I have taken a few of these trendline breaks recently and not lost on one. I had AudUsd go the other way and so not click the trade in but no loss. My normal trading style is very long term trades with the trend from support/resistance but I love these tl breaks! If I take any more I'll post them here. Thanks for your interesting thread.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Great, will look forward to your charts, will add variety to the thread. So I gather you are still in the chfjpy short, since your time horizon is longer term?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hey After Daily I went back on the 4 hr chfjpy chart (attached) Did you take those trendline breaks?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
No, I prefer to take profit at the next s/r level with these tl breaks. I did trade a chfjpy tl break in the past few weeks and that was a good 150 pip trade I seem to remember. My trading record is at the link in my signature, chfjpy is in there somewhere.

Would like to put some thoughts for new traders to consider in money management. Starting capital $50000 divide by 50=$1000 per day maximum loss limit limit losses to a maximum of $400 per standard lot traded With that formula in place you can then at least last 50 days. When one trades and starts out, one needs the ability to be in the game long enough to learn and hopefully fine tune your system to be profitable in the long run. Remember, to get from $1 to $1m is not 1 step, but you must count $1 $2 $3 $4 and so on to hopefully eventually get to $1m.

It has been an interesting few weeks since this thread has started. I enjoy the experience of having my own thread.

With that, this will be my last post for a while at least. Cheers to all

I will address your question. How can 2 or 3 data points determine a trend? ANS: Well, the minimum you need to determine a trend are two data points. You cannot use one data point. You need at least two. This is mathematics. Now, for a given sample size, two may or may not be enough. It all depends on what you are looking for, what function you are using to plot these two data points together, what is the statistics noise level, etc. But just because you have two data points doesnt mean it is meaningless. Also, the presupposition that you have two or 48 data points is simply contextual. That is, it all depends on the timeframe. Using the daily chart, a single data point is 1, but zoom to hourly chart, that same single data point suddenly becomes 24 data points. Since you've converted daily to 24hourly data. You can to this for monthly vs 1hour. In that sense a single monthly data point suddenly becomes an 720 data points(24hours X 30 days). As such, a 1, 2, 3 data points are all in the eyes of the beholder. Why is a trendline a straightline? ANS: In algebra, to draw a line you need at least two points. All algrebaic lines are straight. So, why wont a trading system(trendlines) based on algebraic concept of lines be straight? Of course, it will be straight. Trendlines are straight because they are based on algebraic concept of lines which are themselves straight. Unless you want to challenge the foundational concept of mathematics that derives straightlines. Not to get really off topic, even curves and circles are straight lines when you use differential calculus limit/exhaustion method. dy/dx. That said, any trend determining mechanics doesnt have to be a straight line: moving averages, elliot waves, series of swing highs/lows, etc. all these can determine a trend. But asking why is a trendline a straight line is like asking why is elliot waves a wave or why is moving averages averages. It makes no sense. the nature of trendline is to be a line, and lines are straight otherwise they wont be a line. Asking why a line is straight is meaningless, trendlines are lines, they have to be straight, otherwise, they wont be a line. This is axiomatic. This is a mathematical axiom. It is the same as asking why is a curve a curve or why is a triangle a triangle or rectangle a rectangle.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Very good answers, well done. As prices derived from the auction process (market) are the end result of supply and demand form market participants, there is an inherent randomness and hence madness to market prices. By using assumptions and orderly structures such as trendlines and TA, one can get (hopefully) a more cognisant picture on which to make buy and sell decisions.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thank you. Your response makes sense to me. We are all trying to impose some sorts of pattern on a chaotic market interaction. That is all. We are all working with approximations. The bottomline line is not the philosophical rigour of your method, the bottomline is: are you making money? That is the bottomline. Everything else can go out of the window

hi emacro how do you know which direction to draw the trendline in order for it to break up or down? does it matter? do you consider larger timeframes when you draw your trendlines? when i look at your charts it looks so obvious but when i look at mine i dont know where to start!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Sorry for the late reply. The trendline is a 'line in the sand' between having a bullish bias or bearish bias. Say you choose the higher timeframe as 30 min (as in CAD futures attached) the larger timeframe 30m is showing bearish bias, so on lower timeframe trigger like 1 min etc you'd try to draw the trendline to go with the direction of the higher timeframe bias from which side of any trendline drawn. Note: bottom chart 1 min top chart 30min Hope it helps. Cheers

The problem with your tl's is that: 1. TL's in general are very subjective based on where you draw the starting point. 2. Secondly, you're tl's are so short term in nature that they have not been well tested. I've tried for a long time to trade breaks but its one of the hardest strategies. Breaks fail more often then they succeed, which brings be to a few more questions. 1. Looks like you're going long on the pull backs?.. why?..if most breaks fail, why are you not shorting the pops and at least covering at the retest of the tl? would be nice to see you post entries on these charts when they occur and update them with exit prices. Anyone can throw up charts.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Yes, that's right. Some traders are thinking that breakout is easy to trade compare with trend following. But it is exact opposite - it is difficult to trade. It is easy to see it on the chart (post-breakout) but it is not easy to trade using price action only (sr and tl only).

--- 帖子 #371 ---
This is USDJPY for now as an example - we see breakout levels, besides - the price break one trendline ... I do not remember the name of this price pattern when the price is inside the cross created by 2 trendlines ... cross? so if the price will go out of this cross - it is indicating some movement (to the side the price go to).

I am using very old MaksiGen indicator (attached) with default settings. And I am using M1 timeframe just especially ... to see how the price willm ove in quick way. Of course, M1 timeframe is not a typical, one for this kind of trading.

It is the situation for now: Attached Image Where the price will go? It depends on which trendline will be crossed by price ...

Lower trendline was crossed by price. Downtrend Attached Image

well. do you know why it is so difficult to trade on this way? Because trendlines and support/resistance lines are indicating the following: what is going with the price right now. Right now on open bar. It is very different from standard indicators because we are trading indicators on close (means: previous) bar. And trendlines - on open bar; it means: the situation is changed every moment in case of trendlines.

Price is trying to cross this line, we see it? Attached Image if the price will cross this line so price will go down for some more ... pips for example. It is just nothing for M1 timeframe but if we will use it on H4 or D1 - it may be good profit.

I think emacro is correct (read first post of this thread):

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I agree the trendlines are very subjective, hence the 'art' in tech analysis. The breaks are a reason to trade. What we want to do is to try to get aboard a trend and 'let it run'. The timeframe however will determine how long it can potentially last. No method is 90% or 100%, and at some point, all technical methods will fail. Moves like the eurjpy 1hr will hopefully enable the trader to cover some failed breakout trades. It is good to have others say their mind on whether a method is crap or not, as everyone is entitled to their opinion. Anyway Crude Oil is on its way.

Yes. because everything is going more quicky using M1 so I do not need to wait for half a day to open one trade for example Of course, tl/s/r lines are used in different way in case of M1 and M5 (similar with scalping way sorry).

So, it is metatrader statement. I opened first trade for USDJPY yesterday (see some my previous post on this thread), and finished the trading few hours ago. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Metatrader statement is attached to this post (in rar archive). Please find attached the second indicator I am using: MaksiGen_Range_Move mtf 2. And template is attached too. How to install. - Place MaksiGen_Range_Move mtf 2 indicator (attached to this post) and Maksigen indicator (see link below to download) to indicators folder of Metatrader directory (for example, to C rogram Files - MetaTrader - Alpari - experts - indicators ); - place template file (attached to this post) to template folder (for example, to C rogram Files - MetaTrader - Alpari - templates); - compile indicators to MetaEditor, or restart Metatrader; - open M1 chart, right mouse click on the chart, select our template - indicators will be loaded to the chart. And you can practise for example. Please note: M1 timeframe is used just to practise only. I am using M1 timeframe for trading s/r/tl but using M1 timeframe - looks like trading pure price action without indicators (means: it is difficult and required some experience). But it is really good practise for the people who want to understand about trendlines. After that you can reply to very simple question: "hi guys, it seems breakout is good but what is it all about?"

Well, talk about 'trend following'...

--- 帖子 #390 ---
i've seen your trading statement, one question, how to setup and manage our Take Profit and StopLoss ? I see all your trading closed, some trade differ than take profit or stoploss. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
In case of trading manually - I am always trying to use stop loss. And I am using take profit sometimes. When I am trading manually so I can open one trade .. after that - I can re-enter on same pair (after reversal for example). Because of that (many trades are kept to be opened on the same time) I try to close the trades based on the situation ... and the situation (especially for M1 timeframe) are changed all the time. Besides - I am closing the trades based on margins ... if the price is going against me so I am trying to close some trades with small profit to avoid margin call ... besides, I do not want to receive big floating drawdown because as we know - market was not going in fully trend following way yesterday - it was some ranging time as well. To make it shorter - there are many trading styles (in case of trading manually): - classical trading style (one trade per pair only; next trade will not be opened untill old trade is closed) - re-entering ... ... and so on So, I am using re-enter - re-enter is the term which was originally used in AscTrend software made by american AbleSys Corp, and this term was used by many traders and coders after that in Russia and everywhere. But as I remember - this re-enter trading style came from Ichimoku so it's Japanese originally

I do not have have/use those lines sorry. is it other indicator? MTrendLine alert indicator? never used it. From what I see from your chart image - those lines are the distance between the line and the price itself in points (point = pips * 10 in case of 5 digit broker). But in your case (is it 4 digit broker, right?): points = pips. So, it is the distance. Can not say more as I do not have it sorry. ======= - MaksiGen indicator is on this post (indicator is drawing s/r/tl depends on preselected number of bars). - MTrendLine alert indicator is on this post . - MaksiGen_Range_Move mtf 2 indicator is on this post . - Template to trade or monitor M1 timeframe is on this post .

About re-enter ... It is something what I explained for some other forum. it is classical way of trend following trading (1 trade per chart/pair in trend following way): Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is classical way of trend following trading with re-enter: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is classical way of trading with scalping re-enter: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This trading style (re-enter) was hard coded for some trading platform (very very long time ago; not for metatrader) with exact this word - 're-enter'. Means: we are having the main trade/order, and we are "playing" inside this trade/direction by openning/re-entering. Scalping in this way is the same re-enter but without the main trade/order. There is counter trend style as well but it is something similar: there is main trade/order (or without it if in pure scalping way), and re-enter is made in counter trend way (in opposite direction to the main trend/trade). Difference between classical styles and pure scalping is the following: - in classical way with re-enter - the main trade/order should be opened; - in pure scalping way/style - we are trading without openning the main trade/order just making re-enters (in trend following way, or in counter trend way) taking onto consideration this main trend. ======= - MaksiGen indicator is on this post (indicator is drawing s/r/tl depends on preselected number of bars). - MTrendLine alert indicator is on this post . - MaksiGen_Range_Move mtf 2 indicator is on this post . - Template to trade or monitor M1 timeframe is on this post .

all picture using Maksigen indicators? and H1 time frame?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
yes, except "star" and "cross" marks which I made manually on the chart. Maksigen indicator is having the settings ... did you see vertical lines on the chart? Attach Maksigen indicator with default settngs - and you will see. Name of those parameters? Move your mouse to any of this vertical line - and you will see the name of the parameter in indicator. Those lines are the bars. Maksigen indicator is drawing support/resistance lines (trend line is one of them) calculated for some number of bars. So, if you change the settings in indicator - you will receive different s/r/tls calculated based on different bars. There are some indicators with re-enter (coded by Igorad - ask him please) but I did not use them in trading here. In my trading here - I used exact template which I uploaded here. ======= - MaksiGen indicator is on this post (indicator is drawing s/r/tl depends on preselected number of bars). - MTrendLine alert indicator is on this post . - MaksiGen_Range_Move mtf 2 indicator is on this post . - Template to trade or monitor M1 timeframe is on this post .

trendlines (i use mouteki/tom demark trendlines) is my main method of trading mixed in with a few other deciding factors which i will not mention here because it has nothing to do with emacros way. if your willing to take a few 20 to 50 point losses and let your trades run this method will pay off for you in the long run..

Hi newdigital, Why don't you place your Buy Stop and Sell stop at the lines Blue and red ? Thanks a lot for sharing, King regards !

Yes but when the lines have changed and anyone of stop order is opened, do you change the stop order or when a stop order is took it doesnt change. Thanks!

Yes, dotted lines are moved and I am modifying pending orders. If by few points so not a problem but if some pips - I am moving/modifying stop orders too.

Your screenshot from post #57 is very good. But how can I summarize? This is support/resistance trading ... a lot of information published ... it is impossible to summarize in one-two posts sorry. Just read all my posts here. By the way, this is not good time for trading (Christmas and New Year time). Some people are not trading on December for example.
