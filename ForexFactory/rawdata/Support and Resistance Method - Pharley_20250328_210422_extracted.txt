This method is below in the first few posts, or in a nutshell at Post 185 on Page 10. Live trades taken with result of +60% account growth in 1 trade run starts at Post number 176 on page 9. 1. Weekly candle chart - Draw in areas/lines of SR:

--- 帖子 #2 ---
2. Daily chart (same time period) - move to daily candle chart and watch candle price action and SR area - pin bar at support formed:

--- 帖子 #3 ---
3. Set up target area - I use a modified Fib just for measuring. I take 90% of the previous move as the target:

--- 帖子 #4 ---
4) 4hr entries - I move to 4hr candle and look for my first entry. This one is a 50% retracement entry. All targets for multiple trades at at my target level (see 3 above):

--- 帖子 #5 ---
5) Second entry - on the 4hr candles. I wait until the first 4hr candle closes above yesterdays high. SL from trade 1 is move up to where SL for T2 will be:

--- 帖子 #6 ---
6) I keep entering on 50% retracements and either a 4hr candle closing above yesterday high, or wait until a break above the high comes back to retest the break point.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Approach is: 1) Weekly chart, draw major SR levels 2) Daily chart - wait for price to come to those areas. Look for PA candles - Pin Bars etc 3) 4hr for entries on 50% retraces, confirmed higher breaks, or retraces back to break points 4) Set SL at logical positions - normally last swing H or L 5) Move SL up (or down) to the new trade SL point - this locks in profits 6) Target is the same for all trades - Measure the last move between S and R and take 90% as a target 7) Enter multiple times - Each time I get my SL up to the latest trade, I'm locking in profits. Most importantly my risk is remaining constant. 8) For the very first trade of a move, I only risk half of my normal risk - this is because price can do anything, and it may go against me 9) once price moves in my favour I enter at my normal risk level 10) If I have multiple trades open and they are at risk, the total risk only adds up to my overall risk level 11) I stop trading the run when reward to risk gets lower than about 2 to 1 12) Sometimes I will enter on continuation candles during the run - inside bars, pins, but I try and keep it as simple as possible

I use a position calculator (from Babypips) to calculate lot sizes based on SL position and my risk level. My risk I take in $ and not so much %. I can live off $ but not % ! It's nothing new, nothing complex. I'm not reinventing the wheel. I'm just applying basic price action to enter multiple times on a run - that's where you can get thousand of pips from a 500 to 800 pip run. Normally the reward to risk for the early trades is around 8 or 10 to 1. I started the thread because I've been posting in the Rookies section to help a few there - it's about time I brought it together in 1 place! Less confusing for this ancient brain!

Here's another slightly later trade taken - another 50% retrace. Notice stops have moved up:

Here is trade number 13 taken on the same run, and my last for this run:

And the exits:

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Not all work out - If you look at 2 Daily chart above, I was entering in Jan from the second bounce from support - that failed, but I only risk half my normal amount. I also took the third bounce and it went away in my preferred direction. The big gains really outweigh the few losses I might have in getting in to a run.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Now the boring bit: Been trading for about 8 years. Initially shares/stocks, then CFDs, then forex. Always used market makers - now I've dumped them and gone to ECN. Always used to trade 1m, 5m, 15m charts with MACD, stochs, RSI etc. Dumped them and went with price action, no indicators, just SR. My approach is based on support and resistance being THE most important thing on the charts. Equally as important is risk mgt. It works for me and may be useful to some others. I know PA traders are probably doing all this stuff already. For me it's a no brainer now - after losing and losing some more, I took about 6 months out of the game to rethink, analyse and learn. Then about 2 years ago I came back to it with this approach and it's working very well. UK National, Aussie Citizen, now living in Thailand - the freedom is nice! Don't like waffle or BS. Simpler seems to be better. Oh happy to answer any questions! Cheers all.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Nice system... Keeping it simple.. I see too many on here with 4 or 5 indicators. I love support/resistance myself. good luck!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks bloodpoodle - that's what I reckon as well! Still, if something works for someone then just master the method whatever it is, plan it and trade it.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Please explain how you arrived at your 100% level. From the charts you posted, I can not deduce how you arrived at that level (177.38).

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Tooslow, If you look at the chart at 2, you can see the last price move from support to resistance to the left of the arrow. That height is what I'm measuring, then taking 90% of it for my target. Chart 3 shows a closer view of it with a modified fib on the chart to measure it. You don't have to use a fib like that - just take top from bottom to get the range in pips and calc 90% of it. If you want to go for 80%, use that figure. Cheers

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Do you have a trade explorer providing live examples of the trades you take using this system?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Here is another I took more recently on the GBPJPY. I wasn't able to get in front of the charts as much during this run, and only entered 3 times but still managed to get just under 1750 pips (only 2 trades are shown):

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Rtm, No I've never done a trade explorer thing - not sure what's involved with it. I'll check it out though. Cheers

( 185.06 - 175.42 ) * 0.90 = 8.676 175.42 + 8.67 = 184.09 ?? What am I missing, pharley? Also, do you agree with the S/R levels in this chart? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Tooslow, Not missing anything there mate - I had a TP at 184.04 - just a few pips different. Yes those SR levels look fine to me. Cheers

pharley, thanks for sharing. Your method is simple and rational, both of which is very important. It would be nice to have an explorer, or at least some live calls so that the interested people can learn the method in real time. Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi kprsa, Yes some live calls might be the way to go. Next time I'm trading I'll post screen shots as I'm doing it. I don't have an explorer or anything. I know someone asked me before about trade explorer - I took a look at it, but I can't really see the value in it other than for everyone to see how well or not I'm doing. No one will learn anything from that and it's just an ego booster for me which is a no-no. Ego has no place in trading - we're all here to do our best and try to make some money out of this. Like everyone else, sometimes I win, sometimes lose. But I'm confident with my method and risk mgt so I enter without thinking when I see a set up. Just a further little bit on a 50% retrace entry on the 4hr charts. What I'm looking for is price moving away from (eg) support and moving higher than the recent price action - if this is a pin bar on the daily or engulfing, I'm very interested in trading it. I use the fib by place the bottom (0%) and the low, and as each 4hr candle gets higher, adjust the 100% value of the fib to the top of the candle. Then I place a pending order at the 50% level. Of course the lot size gets adjusted with each move to maintain the same level of risk. If there are a few 4hr candles starting to appear with lower highs, I leave fib at the highest point of the move. If price comes back to fill the trade, great. I trust in the PA and my risk mgt to keep me safe. If price moves well away from that area, I forget that retrace entry and look for others. On the other entry I mainly use - I simple wait until the first 4hr candle of a new day closes above the high (in effect minor resistance) of the previous days high, then enter at market. Continuation candles in the middle of the run are taken normally as pin bar plays, inside bars plays. That's all there is to it. This pic shows 2 x 50% retrace entries on 4hr. The red lines are the SL of T1 and T2 as they are originally placed. I would be moving T1 SL up to T2 SL as price moves up, then keep moving all SL for all trades up to the latest SL area.

Hello Pharley Great method of long term trading and thanks for posting it. How many pairs are on your watch list?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
One of the best threads I've seen here. This method is so solidly-based, on parameters that actually mean something, that even "scaled-down" versions of it, on faster time-frames, can also be steadily profitable, with appropriate position-sizing - albeit with a lower overall win-rate. (I trade this without using the Fibonacci lines, myself, deriving targets from the ATR.) But the time-frame version described here is more reliable. Thanks indeed for a "solid, sensible" thread.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hello, i really like this method. I have a question about the picture that you uploaded (added it as an attachment) - i don't really know why do you have 2 fibos on that chart. What is the reason for it? Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks Xela, Yes I may work on a lower time frame as price is somewhat fractal in nature. Perhaps using 4hr SR with 15m candle entries going off those area? I don't know as I haven't checked it out but might be worth a look. Perhaps I'm getting lazier in my old age but I prefer the longer timeframes! No, really it's because I find anything under 4hr too noisy for me. Everytime I look at a 1 hour chart, I always end up zooming as far out as I can as I feel I can't see the big picture. Anyway good luck with that and your trading - don't worry about the fib lines - I use it purely as a measuring tool and not as a fib at all. Cheers

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi OSsloth, Thanks for the question. I only use a fib as a measuring tool and not as a true fib. I was fed up with taking the top of a range and the bottom, taking one from the other, multiplying by 90% etc. So I just altered the fib tool - took off the normal setting and added my own. On Mt4 I can actually name the lines as SL, 50% entry, 1R, 2R etc. Not sure how to do that on cTrader, but it's the same thing. So on that pic, there are 2 because I'm jut showing 2 retraces. Blue fib for the first retrace and grey for the second. Sorry if it looks a bit confusing - 2 pics might have been better! By modifying the fib (I don't use normal fib levels at all) I can use it for measuring runs and the 90% of them for my targets, also use it for retraces, and also I can see at a glance what risk:reward I can expect to get out of a trade - so it just speeds up the process for me. Hope that helps! Cheers

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Prax and thanks - glad you can get something out of this. I think the key to it is simplicity and just not overcomplicating things. Support and resistance - there are quite a few good threads on here covering these points and they're right - it's a must learn for any trader and I suspect the real key to success. This method is just using a few well known PA methods and principles and applying them in such a way so as to get multiple entries on a run. As a newbie some years ago I never ever thought about entering multiple times. Now with some good set ups, trade mgt and risk mgt, I try and do this all the time. Cheers

Hi 4xplosion, Thanks for the post. I find the chart a bit busy and confusing though. It's probably because 1) I got rid of indies some time ago and 2) also I don't really consider the 1hr charts. I find them too noisy. 3) Plus it's probably my old eyes can't take it anymore! (yes, old fart here). I prefer to just have the SR on and de-clutter the charts like the one below of the eurusd. But look, if you're getting some good wins with it - great! Go for it! I'm really not in to telling anyone how to trade - we're all different and have different preferences.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
thanks for your input, it's your thread and don't want to hijack it.....but I have found that fibs and s/r can get quite subjective....just trying to wrap my head around the whole idea/concept......part of the learning curve.....that being said....could you possibly post some charts B4 you enter a trade so we can all learn together....with 4hr charts...we can all anticipate and monitor together....any input on the nzdusd 4hr from you would be appreciated...I tend to lean towards bullishness atm...the Monthly high is at 6604....seems like if it can penetrate...would be a good place for a run long...

Just thought I'd pop down what made me spend a lot of time investigating how to enter multiple times and gain some big pips. May be of interest. A while back I was looking at forex competition results - you know, crazy high returns, crazy high leverage and risk. I could see returns of 1000% to 10,000% in a month and thought - well these guys must be nuts trading with max leverage, max risk etc. Turns out some of time they weren't taking massive risks. I could see that some big returns were actually possible, but I wasn't really bothered about the $ returns - what really struck me was the amount of pips they could get. The more I looked at their trades, the more I realised that top 10 traders had a lot in common. They had a method that they stuck to. They help positions open for several weeks. They managed their trades actively across the time period. And yes they got a bit lucky - what I mean is, if they were going long on a pair, there was no terribly bad news affecting the currency pair during the several weeks they were trading. Plus - they entered many many times on a single pair. So I went and analysed all their trades - firstly using indicators to see if I could find what made them enter when they did. For most of them I could never match up stochs, RSI, MCD etc with their entries. So I took off indies and went naked. Then things started lining up with SR areas, and mostly not 15m timeframes, but longer timeframes. (all this took me ages to do!). What I realised was that many were looking at the big picture and seeing where major SR points were and trading inbetween them, riding resistance down to support or support all the way back to resistance areas. Note that it was Major SR areas . Yes some of their risks were bigger than I would take, perhaps 20% or so. But when I'm trading for example and use a 5% risk, that's only 5% of my account. Not 5% of my total money available. So I'm not concerned too much with all the advice about only risking 1% to 3%, but I do keep it sensible at up to around 6% or so. (only a guideline as I use $ risk and not %). So I just stopped focussing on the money side of things and looked at how they got the pips. There is another website somewhere called Double in a Day - where they trade mostly 15m &amp; 1hr charts, basically channel trading and try to double their account in a day with 100 pip run. Seems to work sometimes. However, what struck me again was that it was possible - and once again, they enter multiple times. They use auto entries at 40% of the run, 60% etc. I'm not keen on that - I prefer to use PA to guide me on where to enter. So, what's the upshot? It made me look at how to gain maximum pips. The $ comes from risk mgt and can come later - but gaining the pips was an eye opener for me and I put the focus very much on to that goal - get as many pips as possible and how to manage the trades and stops to keep risk constant and sensible. I remember one of the contest winners saying - if you can work out how to do this, you only need to do it once, then you will always know how to do it. Your life changes as you stop trading all the time. Trade every couple of months or so focussing on the big picture, but when you're trading a run, you're flat out doing it. Then have a break. Take your money out of your account and leave enough there for the next run. Go invest that money in something else - pay off debts, property etc. The next time you're trading, you're trading with money you didn't have in the first place. Anyway, a bit boring I know but that's what made me focus on multiple entries. Cheers

Hi mate, Yes I'll take a look - got to go offline for a bit now though - I'll come back later. No worries about comments - all are welcome! Note that I only use the fib as a measuring tool - I don't use it as a fib should be used. I'm not interested in the normal levels 38.something%, 61.something% - it's just for measuring. I can live without it - it just makes measuring runs quicker and visually easier for me. Cheers

Catching sequences with multiple entries lasting 1-3 weeks is something I came to a similar conclusion some time ago with FX but it presents a problem for me due to my timezone. I live in New Zealand therefore much of the good intraday movement is outside my waking hours. Because of this, I find it very hard to get locations where I can add more and then this leads to the question of, OK now that I've added more, how do I manage with the increased exposure at worse prices. Another issue is that of trade frequency. Trying to catch one sequence every month or two is not frequent enough for both my equity curve and my personality. I know I need to be participating at least 2-3 times a week minimum. I know, these problems listed are my personal problems and everyone is different. I definitely see the benefits of playing a sequence, I find it hard to implement, manage, and work into my life and personality. With kind regards, MK

Hi there, I took a look at NZD USD - it's at a monthly support so I'd want to wait for a clear signal before trading it. The weekly chart shows it bouncing around that support without direction - in fact it tried go to up in the last 2 weeks and got pushed down again. The daily doesn't chow anything except it travelling along the support. The 4hr chart shows it in a range of just under 200 pips - but it keeps getting drawn back to the support. I wouldn't trade it until a good signal comes from it and for me to trade it it would have to break above 0.677.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi mate, I've done the pic again - see below. I change the fib settings to get equidistant levels. You can see there are 11 lines which separate the run into 10 equal parts. I put the fib from the bottom of the run to the top - 1 line down from the top is the 90% line I use for targets.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi MK, Yes time zones are always a problem for some - it just comes down to where you're located. Perhaps trade off a shorter time frame, or stay with the longer timeframe and look across a dozen pairs - there's normally something going on. One of the things to keep in mind is that there's not just one way to trade. Sure you can do this longer term trading, but if you want some more action in the week, look at playing 4hr candles with PA set ups. I'd look at 4hr charts for the trend and SR, then 1 hr charts to find an entry - here's a good example below in the usdchf. If you pick say 6 pairs to look at you should see something happening a couple of time per week at least. Then there are the PA candles such and Pin bars and inside bar that can be played - open any chart on the 4hr and look for them - there are heaps.

Hi Pharley, Bless you for for sharing the system, I am still trying to understand a few points before trying, one of the points you mentioned below. 3) 4hr for entries on 50% retraces, confirmed higher breaks, or retraces back to break points a. Is this 50% retracement after it has moved 1 level between 00 and 1R or 1R to 2R fib level and then retraces 50%, we enter immediately or wait for the candle close? b. The trailing stop loss, do you have a pip level below the 4hr swing lows or highs that you use in your trading. c. If trade moves in one swoop three levels like 3R to 6R, and swing stop is at 4R and retraces back to close position, and then starts moving up again from 1R, do you start adding positions again? thankyou

--- 帖子 #51 ---
and another one - seems to be on it's way. Rats, I missed a 50% retrace on this - I've only just seen it as I didn't have the chart open. Never mind, I'll continue to watch to see where I can enter. Pic of day and same time frame on 4hr with fib showing a potential retrace entry. Major resistance turned to support at 1.2985:

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi Alamhakim, Thanks for your questions. I'll try to answer them: 1. It's the move on the fib between 0% and 100%, then moves back to the 50% level. I place a pending order to buy (or sell) immediately with SL at the 0% and TP at an identified target. 2. There is no set pip level below for example a swing low (for longs). I would normally move stops up to the swing low point - I might give it a couple of pips breathing room, but not much. 3. I might do - It depends on the price action on the charts. It may be that if it retraces a large amount that is hits all stops and closes them out. At that point I reassess the charts and decide what I'll do. Each situation can be different so you have to stop and take another look. If it's come back a long way and hit my stops, I look if I'm wrong with the trade, or conditions have changed - market news or something. If I've entered several times by that point, I should have moved stops up enough so that most of them except the last one would have locked in profit. Ooo - just to qualify something - I really don't like adding to any losing position - if it's going to hit a SL and I"m to take a loss, that's fine - I ensure any loss is within my risk tolerance. Hope that helps - I know it's a bit uncertain, but that's the nature of trading. If it was clear cut what to do, we'd all be doing very well ! But it's part art and part science. If ever I'm unsure, I stop and reassess and don't blindly enter. Cheers

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks so much, I thought I understood how you drew the fib, but I have not, as for example the usdcad, we use the 1D to draw the recent swing levels and use the extensions 1R, 2R...9R to mark the levels? So those levels might not be recent for a long time as in USDCAD.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
This stuff fascinates me: http://news.forexlive.com/!/how-geor...hours-20130507 The thing is, I have no idea what made Soros enter these trades, but that analyst has a fair idea where he entered some shorts. Yes, Soros and Quantum fund have access to all the latest fundamental data, but even with that, you have to look for an entry once you've decided on a direction - everyone does. The funny thing is, when I look at 50% retracements at the time he took the trades, guess what? Is that coincidence or not? I have no idea, but very interesting: -

Thanks for answering, still not quite getting the hang of where to draw the top and bottom of the fib tool. I thought I understood how you drew the fib, but I have not, as for example the usdcad you mentioned, we use the 1D to draw the recent swing levels and use the extensions 1R, 2R...9R to mark the levels?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Alamhakim, Not quite right. On the USDCAD chart, I'm only using it to show the 50% retrace, so only using the 0% 50% and 100% - all the others levels I'm not using at that point. It shows 0% at the low, 100% at the top of a little run, and automatically you can see where the 50% levels is for entry. Cheers

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Prax, I'd be waiting to look for a confirmed move - I took a look at the weekly chart and you can see that price has run up to a resistance level from some time back. Price has to confirm it's moving down again or break through and retrace to the break level before I would enter. If it's going to fall, I'd be looking for and engulfing bar on the daily chart, or pin and 2/3 candle formation to reverse. Cheers

Hi all, Someone has sent me an email asking can I show (or give some insights) in to drawing support and resistance levels. For sure I can but there are heaps of well written articles on the web about it. What I'd rather do is instead of taking up space here explaining how I identify SR levels, I'd rather point you to a very good article about it. It's worth a read even if you're familiar - I refer to this every now and again - sort of to clear my mind and get it refocussed on what I'm doing. Some advice for new traders - search and find really good articles that cover specific topics, and keep them as favourites in your browser. Better than that, copy the article and paste it in Word, Excel or something in case the site goes down. Keep them, read them, read them again. In a few months read them again. Practice what they say - open any chart, identify SR levels, identify where an entry could be, look for the right candles. I can't teach the invaluable lessons that chart time can give. There isn't a short way around it - you have to spend HOURS in front of the charts looking for specific things. Get good articles on support and resistance (this one is very good), candles, retracements, risk &amp; money management, psychology of trading. Then get some articles on your favourite set ups - if you want to play off Pin Bars, get 1 or 2 good articles on how the play them and keep them - these are your references. Build up your reference library. Something else I do is identify what I want on a chart and keep a copy and an example of the different entries I look for. Look at them regularly and go find more of them. It's practice and practice. Your eyes become used to looking and quickly identifying your set ups. Here is a SR article: Cheers http://beatfxmarket.com/forex-suppor...istance-lines/

Hi Pharley, I try to reproduce your system on the AUDUSD chart. Attached one example (two attachments), can you please look at them and is this what you mean?? Red vertical line would be the entry (50% fibo). Questions: 1. As you can see there are two pinbars. If I would have act on the first pinbar I would have been stopped out. A situation that is common in these resistance area's. In my example I choosed the second pinbar. Please explain where to wait for. 2. Drawdown in this example would have been 64 pips. Is this normal in your system? You take 50% fibo retracement which could easy also lead to 100% or more as a retest of the last resistance level (see also example of the first pinbar). Please some more explanation about this 50%. 2. I do not understand your 90% target level. From what is the 90% derived, on which chart 4hr, Daily? From which move or levels? What would have been my target in this example? 3. Would you take another trade if the close of today is higher than the close from yesterday. Wait for the 50% retracement before enter? How important are the monthly S&amp;R lines for you? You did not mention them. Already thanks for your answers!!

It is a modified 3_Level_ZZ_Indicator. A very controversial indicator modified by a highly controversial trader. The indicator is labeled "repaint" by some because they don't understand how to use it. The trader asks that his code not be posted because he can't control revisions and bug fixes due to the fact he has been banned from many trading forums including this one. Pharley, your trading style reminded me of this indicator.

Hey Pharley, Great thread. Do you trade polarity flips? EG [weekly] support turning to resistance. If so, how do you set targets for these? Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Great and simple method! Please go on and give out more examples Thank you!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Pharley, Here is a trade I took GBPCAD based on the S&amp;R. GBPCAD reached weekly resistance. On daily chart a pin. On the H4 I looked for the 50% retrace but it was already 100% which I think will happen a lot. Please look at my chart and maybe you like to give me your comments. Already thanks a lot. I am not intend to bombard you with my trades. Once I know it I can do it!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Dutchpips, Thanks for your post. I'll try and answer. If you look at the daily chart below first - I wouldn't have traded anything up to yesterday. What I look for is a daily candle that shows me the way, ie. it's a pin bar or engulfing bar or a real bullish bar away from support. Now have a look at the 4hr one. If I was going to trade this, I place the fib at the high and low of the move, not open/close. Trade would have entered and price would have gone against you by around 40 pips but not hit SL. (Price has started to move away nicely now). So, I wait for a good daily candle to show me the way. In the gbpjpy examples I gave at the start of the thread, you can see that I saw the pin bar occur at support, and then moved down to 4hr charts for entry. Now something important - I don't take every one that I see. First I would draw in the weekly or monthly SR areas, then go to the daily chart to see a set up candle (pin, engulfing, strong move etc). At that point I look at the potential of the move - where is the move likely to go to back up to resistance Is it 100 pips, 200, 500 etc. Then I move to 4hr charts for an entry setup. It may come off a 50% retrace or a confirmed break high or rising trend line. Whatever it is, I look at what my risk reward will be. A ratio of 1:1 doesn't interest me too much - for me its got to be more than 1:2 and I'm very happy when I start seeing 1:5. As for 90% target - it's just an arbitrary figure I use to take profits before a run finishes. You could use 95%, 85% - what ever you feel like. The last pic I post below shows me using the fib to measure 90% of the potential run back to resistance area. It doesn't have to be exact - remember SR areas are not fixed lines, just areas or zones. The timeframe (4hr, day etc) doesn't matter - as long as I can see the last moves. In this example we're looking at, the SR areas are drawn from further away to the left of the chart off weekly SR areas. The monthly are ust as important as the weekly - I just prefer the weekly timeframe as I can see more of the action, but still see what's happening on the monthly timeframe Monthly candles are very important for super long runs! Currently the AUDUSD has finished up on yesterdays candle - what I'll do it look for where I can enter on a 4hr chart and get good R:R back to resistance area If I can't get that I won't trade it. It may be that I if I can't find something on a 4hr I MIGHT go look for an entry on the 1hr - I don't often do that and don't really like to. If I'm not 100% happy with an entry set up, I will just leave it and look elsewhere. But I will watch this pair now and look for entries. Cheers

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi T12 - oh that varies with every trade. Sometimes it could be 30 or 40, sometimes 130. I manage risk by varying lot size so my $ risk is the same whatever size stop loss I'm using. I really don't mind having a 100+pip stop - it doesn't bother me at all. On larger charts with bigger runs you need bigger stops. You just buy less lots. But remember, the aim is to enter multiple times so the gains really increase a lot, rather than just taking 1 trade. Cheers

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi - Do you mean when price for example breaks through support and then retraces to the same area (now resistance)? Yes I'm always on the look out for those - classic set ups on any timeframe. SL would be at the last swing high prior to the break through and set a target off either the weekly Support area. If you just want to take a trade with 1:2 or 1:3 R:R, then just set targets to those - make sure to look you have the room for those targets before trading. Another way to trade these is to just place a limit sell order just before the retrace point. With this you're trusting SR and PA action will work as you're entering without confirmation (I prefer confirmation). SL and targets as before. CHeers

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi MissH, Thanks heaps! Will do next time I'm on line. Cheers

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Dutchpips, That pin bar off the daily chart is not a good one to take - it isn't a classic shape for one and in fact finishes up for the day. I want to see a strong move away from SR areas - see that article link I posted earlier about SR. On the 4hr chart of the same action below, I've drawn the low of the pin bar from the day chart. You can see the next day didn't break below the low of the pin. I'd need to see a day close below the pin bar day with a strong move down. Or a really strong pin bar formed. At the moment I've no idea what will happen with this pair (no one does), If it breaks through resistance I'll be looking for a retrace entry to that area. Cheers

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Something I just thought about. I didn't explain something else relating to that gbpcad daily chart. I realised that when I looked at it I haven't explained fully what I was looking at. If you look at the chart, part of the reason why I didn't like the pin bar was the price action leading up to it. If you see the few days before, price had just run sideways for some time with no hint that it was going to fall. Then it moved up above the high/resistance areas of that consolidation piece with a strong candle upwards. It's the upwards momentum, plus the lack of price pushing down etc for the lead up to this point - that's why I don't like the look of a short yet. It's hard to teach or explain this sort of stuff and really only comes about through time in front of the charts looking for setups, what price does before hitting SR areas. Cheers

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Pharley, Love the thread. Really want to learn more about S&amp;R, if you had to pick, what one book / DVD or learning material would you recommend ?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hi parley, would like to enquire.. for eg today's EUR/USD, the closing of the 4hr candle at 2000-0000 was lower than the lowest low of the previous day, following the rules, we can open up a trade at the start of the 4hr candle at 0000-0400.. is that correct? also, assuming that we carry on for this particular trade, where the start of the 4hr candle at 0000 for today is somewhere in between the 50% and 100% retracements(zooming in after fibo placed on daily TF), how and where do I locate the 90% TP level?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Looking at the 4hr chart on eurusd........couldn't resist....looking at price penetrate (slice) right thru the previous daily low.....shorted at 1.0878....target is currently at 1.0830 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good and simple method.But I need some live examples to learn real time trading.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi kaharris95, I have no idea about the books/cd's side of things. I've never bought one. All I've done is find good PA websites with good articles and read them. Plus read snippets of advice from pro/experienced traders. Then I've tried to use what I learned - getting away from indicators, practising finding and drawing SR areas, learning about candles, channels, retracements etc. Have a look at this one on SR though - it's very good: http://beatfxmarket.com/forex-suppor...istance-lines/ Cheers

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi menpowerup, There aren't any rules as such - well, I don't consider them to be rules. These are just guidelines on how I trade. Re the eurusd - I'm not sure I'd be trading short as price is very close to a support area (see chart below). I'll be waiting to see if it bounces up from support, or crashed through that and retraces for an entry. Cheers

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Just out of interest, don't just limit yourself to one way of trading. There is no right, one way to trade. I really like trading rising or falling channels as well. I posted earlier on another thread about channels so I thought I'd share a pic on here of usdchf. It's been in a good channel for a while which can be seen on a 4hr chart below. For this channel I've been looking at taking entries off the 1hr chart. That's because the runs up are 150 to 200 pips, so the 1hr charts can give me some more opportunities. Don't forget that trading off channel support is just the same as trading off a horizontal support - it's just on a slope. You'll still find pin bars, 50% retracements, minor SR areas - all the good stuff to check out for further entries. The 1hr chart is also shown below, but go check it out on your charts and look for potential entries and where stops would be and targets. Cheers

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Interesting trades on the usdchf:

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Those are from Support area coming back up, a 50% retrace, an inside bar and not really sure why I entered the last one! However, risk is minimal now and I've got my eye on a higher resistance level than the channel.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Sorry mate - I didn't see that post - you were right! Number of trades varies - most of the time I'm not trading at all, just waiting for price to get to a decent SR area. If it looks like I'm waiting a while, I'll look for some other things like channels (plus flags etc). But don't often trade them unless they're really good and strong. Yes I would look across all those pairs plus probably a couple more. Normally when I'm trading I only trade 1 pair though. I just don't like upping the risk at all.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Someone sent me an email about my platforms and why they look different. In fact I have to do a bit of housekeeping on account and platforms - so a good reminder! Yes I use both MT4 and cTrader and they look quite different from one another. My complications don't stop there though - I have Oanda accounts, both MT4 and their own platform, Pepperstone (both mt4 and ctrader) and IC markets (both mt4 and ctrader), plus another one I don't use much any more. I've been trying out the ctrader for a bit, and also comparing brokers with ctrader and mt4. I think I've come to the conclusion I like ctrader now, but have kept mt4 open in a few places as well. Before my memory starts going, I'll have to do a bit of culling and rationalise!!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Thanks for your answear. so at a normal week or mounth how many trades, runs do you get and am not sure about when you add trades on the same run how many percent gain on account can one get this way ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi again, Probably about 1 trade run a week on average I would say. But that could be short trades - a day or so in length, or trades that go on for weeks, or somewhere in between. Mmmm, without trying to complicate the thread, I do enter multiple times at the same time, i.e. place 2 or 3 trades at the same place or very close, either manually or automatically. But think of just entering once initially, then later entering again. I normally add to trades when PA tells me I can - I'm just looking for PA setups to enter again - nothing complicated. Then I try to get all my stops at 1 position as price goes in my favour. Hopefully I can get all my trades at BE or better - as price moves up then my stops move up thereby locking in profit as I go. That way, only the current trade is at risk - I try to always ensure my risk levels remains the same. I don't generally go on a % of risk. I prefer to use a $ risk Having said that I try to keep it reasonable at around the 4% to 7% level. I don't think I've traded with 10% risk. Cheers

--- 帖子 #101 ---
When you add a trade in your run i am confused little bit you have a target for all of your trades the same target and you try to move stop, so the first trades u make are at breakeven ? and you try to get them to the target that is for all the trades. How do you mean you lock in profit ? Pleae explain. Yes you enter with a 4 percent risk of you account per trade but what does that add up to on a run with many trades ? first trade half risk 2 percent as an example 2 and 3 trade 4 percent risk so with an 1:2 risk reward ratio you can have a run that makes a return of about 20 percent on your account that last for 1 week or maybe 2 or so ? Am i understand things right here ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi, Sort of right. If you go back to the start of the thread I explain how I get my target areas. And yes normally all my trades are targeting the same area to take profit. Targets are based off larger timeframe SR areas, normally from the weekly charts. Lock in profit - When I first enter a trade (eg a long), my stop loss is beneath it, say 50 pips away. As price moves up and PA shows me where I can enter again, as I enter a new trade, I move up the old trade SL to the new trade SL point. Sometimes that is at BE (entry point) on the first trade, sometimes it's above BE. THen as I enter further trades, the stops all get moved to the new point. So in that way if price comes back and takes all my trades out, I've made profits from the earlier trades. In effect, I'm locking in the profit gained. THe very first trade I open, I only use half my normal risk, because I don't know if it will go in my favour or not, so that might be 3%. If price goes in my favour, the remainder of trades will be entered at my full risk - let's say 6% in this example. If I can't get earlier trades to BE, then I only enter a trade at a reduced lot and reduced risk, so that my total overall risk remains the same. I normally am targeting a lot more than 1:2 risk:reward. As for gains, well as I explain earlier in this thread, I studied heaps of things to learn how to obtain large returns for a normal risk. Eg if you target say 300 pips and enter multiple times at say 4% risk each time (it won't be quite that due to not being able to get trades at BE) and say your SL is 50 pips, then for the first trade you're gaining 4% for each 50 pips. That equates to around 24% gain on the 1 trade. You can work the rest out. Then it depends on whether the risk remains the same, or $ increases as a % of your account for the remaining trades. So I don't trade all the time - it's not really required. Keep your eye on the charts yes, because we're always on the lookout for the next good run coming up. Cheers

Hi Pharley, Thanks for your reply on my answers! I appreciate your help a lot!! As long as the idea and setup of the trade is good I am happy for the moment. I see that I have to study the candle formations to see where the market wants to go! I asked you about the 2-3 formation. Is this the same as the abandoned baby. See attachment! Thanks !

--- 帖子 #104 ---
That is a candlestick pattern that you show i think this is what he means a pattern that can consist of many price bars or just a few in bigger timeframes It is a reversal when it makes first and high then a low and then a lower high meaning price is weak on the upside it could not make a higher high so now we are looking for price to take out the last low that it did make and it will be a change in trend for a new big or small trend. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...mentid=1222510 http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...mentid=1167969 http://www.investoo.com/reversal-str...1-2-3-pattern/ Best regards

Hello all, Pharley - great thread. I've been trading for a few months and was initially really successful for a newbie but then I got caught up with all sorts of indicators and smaller time frames and everything went to rat sh$t. Now i'm back to where I started using support, resistance and trend lines and things are starting to work out again. I'm going to give this strategy a go too and I can imagine there will be loads of opportunities! Here is a link to an article which has some similar methods and might help some people to understand where to place stop losses etc. http://www.learntotradethemarket.com...ement-strategy

Hi Dutchpips, Thanks for your question. Those types of candle formations do happen in forex - probably with a smaller gap or no gap. Don't forget railway tracks (up then down or down then up), engulfing bars, then things like head and shoulders etc. Also don't forget Pin Bars occurring at SR areas. If you google forex reveral patterns you'll see heaps of info on patterns, single and multiple candle patterns. Cheers

Hi T12, Oh, I don't trade without SL. That's essential for me to manage my risk. Would have been a nice ride down and for sure on a lower time frame (4hr) for entries I think there would have been plenty of entry possibilities! Cheers

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Re trades on usdchf - I got stopped out eventually on all the trades but for some nice pips gained. Interesting that usdchf has continued to climb, although I did mention earlier that I was targeting a higher SR area. I'll keep an eye on PA currently and see if a long entry shows up. Cheers

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I think, that with multiple entry method, most of the time you are stopped out because retracements. Take profit at 90% of the previous move is very rare, right?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hope you don't mind me answering with my suggestion - I am no expert.... But your target is 90%, that doesnt mean that you need to reach 90% to make a profit as long as you move your SL up to the next support level after each retrace. If you manage to do this for entries on 3 retraces then you will have no risk of a loss and you will make a guaranteed profit. The link that I posted on the last page explains this very well.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Just thought about my last post again. I think you need 4 entries for a guaranteed profit but you can break even after the 3rd.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi T12, No, I don't check all the timeframes line up They may do, but it's not something I'm checking for. I'm just looking for good PA set ups when price is at major SR areas (usually off the weekly charts), or on retracements. If you open up 4hr charts and zoom out, you can start to see the SR areas on that time frame as well - happens on all timeframes. It's just the larger timeframes are more reliable I've found. But you can trade off the 4hr SR areas with say 15m or 30m candles charts as well. As I say, there's not just one method or one way to trade. Cheers

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Lapras, Not really - Look at weekly charts to set SR areas. My trades are taken off the 4hr charts, so price has normally (hopefully!) moved away quite a bit from my original entry which allows a good second trade to be placed. At the point I see if I can get the first trade SL moved up to at least BE or further. Wherever my second trade SL is place, I move the first trade SL to that point - sometimes it's below first trade entry (so trade 1 still has some risk), sometimes it's at BE and sometimes at profit. Wherever it goes, I calculate the lot size for further entries based on my overall risk which I try (hard!) to keep at the same level - $ or % risk level. Cheers

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi WIzlon, Thanks for answering. Whether you're in profit really depends on if for second, third, fourth entries, you can move SL for all trades up. Sometimes just on th second entry you can move your first entry SL up to BE or better - then the second entry can be taken at full risk as the first is holding no risk for you. (I hope I explained that ok! - sounds confusing). Cheers

--- 帖子 #128 ---

--- 帖子 #129 ---
If anyone spots something moving to SR areas on the monthly, weekly, daily charts, let us know - many pairs of eyes are better than just 1! I normally try to do some analysis on the weekend to get ready for the trading week if I see something. However, with a wife and 3 kids and a fat lazy dog, sometimes getting free time isn't an option! CHeers

Hi pharley Thanks for sharing your method on S&amp;R. I've been trading for a few years now using Support and Resistance and really suffer from not being able to trust my own judgement. I love your discipline you've described and the way that you have moulded things to suit your personality. I would like to follow you on your journey and to contribute where I can to your thread. A couple of questions: Do you take into account any fundamentals at all or is it all purely PA? Plus do you look at any commodities like Metals or Crude? Best Wishes

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Pharley, Did you spot the GBPAUD last week? Could you still step in this move after a drawback (fib 50%)? Look also at the weekly chart PA, a big candle down. The move after entry on the 50% fib at the 4hr chart is 140 pips up, would this hit your SL or is your SL more then 150 pips? I would like to step in on the breaking of the trendline (see chart).

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Dutchpips; It's all about scale, perception and interpretation.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi T12, THanks for the post. Yes I have SR areas about the same place - could be interesting to keep an eye on this one!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi - yes that looks fine. Remember to check back in time for any higher resistance area that's higher than on your chart. Probably zoom out on the weekly or go to the monthly. Cheers

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Well as we know - no one knows where price will go! So manage your risk. There's quite a it of action around 2.0500 then then the important level of 2.0000. But be careful with it - the Aussie Feb bank is saying they expect AUD to keep going down for a bit. Wish I had a crystal ball sometimes!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Rover, and welcome. I don't really take account of any fundamentals. Any good news is in the charts. Any bad news is in the charts. So I'm not really bothered about the news - I listen to it, read it. Can't help it, hence above where I say the Aussie might go down somewhat yet. But for me it's all PA. No I don't trade commodities - I just like the currencies! Cheers

Hi Steve &amp; Dutchpips, Thanks for the post Steve - that's exactly right Dutchpips. It's always important to look at the higher timeframes and take your cues from them. I hadn't really seen the GBPAUD coming down a bit - I tend to have a few days away from it (charts, analysis etc) after a run.

OK some interesting things to look out for this week:

Worth keeping your eye on USDCHF as well in case it starts to move up away from the current channel.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
It's always easier somehow to draw the SR areas on the larger timeframes. They don't have to be exact - hell, mine aren't. But it reminds me when I'm looking at charts to keep these areas in mind. I leave the lines drawn on for ages - until they aren't needed any more. So there's some interesting ones there to watch, look for bounces and plan some entries. Good luck all. Cheers

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Pharley, the EA has already rejected at support with two bullish candles and it has retraced 50% of this rejective move up. Would this already be an active trade?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Subaal, I'm not sure which you're talking about. Also I don't use EAs with trading - tried them, along with a zillion indicators and they're just not for me. Cheers

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Here's why I love trading channels as part of all this - look at this chart. It looks a bit confusing, but it shows a channel, retracements to 50% plus retracing to support, pin bars, inside bars. Then look at the 4hr chart - so many entry possibilities. Channels are terrific fun.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I meant Eur Aud chart u posted above. Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Breaking that 1d and 4hr chart of eudaud down to a 1hour timeframe for an entry - (for those who want to look for trades on the shorter timeframe). You can still use the larger timeframes to target these sort of entries. Nice pin at resistance turned to support, play the pin, SL at red line, TP at about 90% of the last range upwards at yellow line. That's about 130 pips for a 37 pip risk. Can't really see how to get in multiple times though! Could enter at a given % of the run, but I prefer to let PA tell me where to enter for further trades. What is interesting (look for these things) is that price went back to the high range (yellow line) and fell away again for a short time - that's people closing trades and taking money off the table.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Ah you mean like this one below - yes it would be fine. You don't win them all although this one wouldn't have hit SL yet. but it's a valid trade off rising support (channel support).

Thats the one Pharley. So if this eventually goes up we can add a trade when h4 closes above previous days highs as per your rules. Is there any rules for example the first trade has to be in profit befor adding trades or the stoploss point of potential trade 2 must be higher than trade one's entry. I.e. trading when first trade can be locked and exposure to market would only be 1 trades worth at any given time the stops decide to be taken out. Thanks for your time and response.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi Subaal, For me, a valid entry would have been that 50% retrace, or wait until the 4hr closes above yesterday's high. Looking at the chart now, I'd wait until price moves back up to the 50% retrace point and probably enter there. The first trade I enter at half my normal risk as I don't know what price will do. Other trades are entered at my full risk level - with this proviso - For a second and subsequent trades, it doesn't matter to me if the first one or 2 are in profit I will take a trade if the entry is there. What I will do though is work out what my total risk will be on all trades that are at risk, and adjust my lot size to ensure my total overall risk remains the same or as close as I can get to it. As soon as I can move trades SL to BE then I do it. Think of these rules as guidelines rather than hard and fast rules. All I'm trying to do is maximise profits through multiple entries while at the same time minimise risk through the money &amp; risk mgt approach that I use. Normally a trade would have to move away then I wait for price to give me a PA sign that I can enter again - normally at that point I can move my stops up from all previous trades to the current trade SL and most trades are then normally at BE or better, except the latest one. Hope that makes sense! Cheers

Hi pharley. Thanks for this wonderful thread. There's sth here i don't really understand. when you say 50% percent retracement i don't understand how do you draw them. Is there any special indicator. I remember you said you use a modified fibo. could you explain more about it?

Hello i am Donald and new at forex. I have been reading this forum and installed the expert. What i like about it that there is not a big fall down in pips. I have backtested the expert on the eur/usd but in the long run i don´t make a profit. Maybey it is the setting that is wrong. Is there an profitible setting for the eur/usd with this expert.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Stevepatt, thanks for your reply! Looking at your perspective, a short would not be a good idea here! Although this could have been a profitable one .

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Pharley, Thanks for all the examples, they are really helpfull! Due to time issues I can not look for setups for all of them at the moment but lets start with the EURAUD at the moment. What do you think about long the GBPUSD? It is testing the weekly resistance and pin on the 4Hr. I thought I read somewhere that you do not use a % for your risk. How do you calculate your risk? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi Dutchpips; I thought the idea of this method was to have Weekly and or Monthly Levels of Support/Resistance marked on the Charts and then look for PA on the Daily TF at these Levels of Support/Resistance. Once you have seen PA on the Daily TF, Pin Bars-Engulfing Bars etc, drop down to the H4 Chart to look for entries. This Weeks Candle tells me there is strong Resistance above next Week start looking for Bearish Setups to Trade Short. This Weeks Candle didn't form at an obvious level of Resistance often you only know S/R is present after the Weekly Candle has formed, see the image below.

Can anyone tell me what the difference is between Supply &amp; Demand trading and Support &amp; Resistance trading? Seems to me it's pretty much the same thing you look for.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thank you for sharing. I've been trading forex for almost a year now and have pretty much given up on all indicators. Support &amp; Resistance, Supply &amp; Demand, Bank Trade entries. That is what moves the market. Oh and news...it does the opposite of what you expect

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thank you so much for this "not boring at all" insight! You are an experienced trader of 8 years. I appreciate your insight, sharing and honesty so very much. One thing I want to ask you though is why concentrate on number of pips so much? I've been focusing on just 20 pips a day and gradually just increasing my lot size. Less exposure to the markets. Which means better risk management for me. Your thoughts on that?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Could be a good buy.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
When you have a run of bad luck you will lose a lot of money if you are trading high volume.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Also if you are aiming for 20 pips profit your stop loss should be about 10 pips max. You will always get stopped out.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
What pr is it ?? Please

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Sorry I'm not quite sure what you mean T12. Price hasn't moved much during the Asian market so you could just buy in at the current price and place your Sl just below the trend line and the horizontal support line....then just Wait for pullback and hopefully get multiple entries.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Obviously there is no daily pin bar but I still see multiple reasons to buy. Horizontal support line. Diagonal trend line. Strong pound. Weak Nzd. Nice tight stop loss. Good risk reward ratio. Might not work out but it's worth a shot in my book.

Hi all, Well I took the 50% retracement off support on the euraud and it's started moving up. I'll see how it goes and look for further entries (EURAUD 4hr chart):

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks for the questions and comments. Also thanks to StevePatt for getting involved as well and helping out. LorraineP - Yes I also used to try and get 20 pips a day using increased lot sizes and too much risk (for me). I wanted a way to gain big pips but not spend hours in front of the charts. After analysing some other peoples results, it seemed obvious to me that the way they gained huge pips was to take a big picture approach and price action with multiple entries. Then spent ages learning how I would go about doing the same. Cheers

--- 帖子 #178 ---
What symbol is it ??/

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi Lorraine, The answers above are relevant to this but I also wanted to add something. When I found out that gaining a lot of pips was possible, I focussed on how to do that. The money comes later - what people should focus on is how to spot good trade setups, when to enter, where to place stops and targets and how to manage a trade run looking for further entries. If you add to one of the most important parts - risk mgt - then you're well on your way to achieving your goal. So the focus was on HOW to do it. Monetary gains can come later, moving up lot sizes as your account grows. Learn HOW to trade first, then worry about the money later. Having said that, if you're getting some consistent and good gains from 20 pips per day or so, then great! Every one is different and has a preferred way to trade. I'm just showing how I trade and hoping it can help some others. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi Pharley, Thanks for explaining that, it is becoming clearer to me post by post the trading method. On the EurAud entry did you use daily chart pin bar to start the entry and then 4hr 50percent swing back for entry? For next entry do price have to move to next level 200 percent level and then retrace to 150 percent for with price signal for entry? Thankyou again

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Alamhakim, I wasn't able to get the retrace from the daily pin up then back to support (away form charts). But then I saw it bounce again from support and took it at the 50% level. For the next entry - no. I have no idea yet where I will enter. Price will tell me where I will enter - either at a 50% retracement on 4hr charts, or if a 4hr candle closes above yesterday's high. I only pick that second one as it normally (not every time) tells me that a move up has been confirmed. At the moment I won't enter again until a 4hr candle closes above the previously swing high (just before it retraced). Cheers

I've never understood the Fib and still not sure I use it properly. On the screen below, did I do it right? And according to this method, is it appropriate to assume that price might drop from the R line? Please explain me Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Wattaman, Thanks or your question. No, I use the fib differently - note that I only use it as a measuring device. What I do is this: 1. On a weekly chart, identify and draw in major support and resistance areas; 2. Go down to the daily chart when price nears these areas and look out for interesting PA bars at these major S/R areas - these can be pin bars for example; 3. Then I go down to the 4hr chart to look for entries - this can be playing a daily pin bar, engulfing bars, etc, or look for retracements on the 4hr charts. 4. When I've seen an entry I use the fib as follows: 5. Go back to the weekly chart (or zoomed out daily chart) and measure the last previous run from support to resistance (or resistance to support) - and I take 90% of that run as my target. I use the fib to see where the 90% target will be. 6. My fib also has a 50% retrace level on it - this is what I use to measure where the 50% retrace level is, so I can place pending orders at that level. So basically I use the fib to measure the last big run on weekly (perhaps daily) charts between SR areas and identify 90% for targets, and also use it to show 50% retracements on the 4hr charts. Hope that helps Cheers

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thanks for explaining me. I'm afraid I'm a slow learner. I think I've got it now. The 50% is only for the next trades, to enter the retracements.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi pharley, Thank you for taking the time to do another summary of your method. I've picked a few really nice pointers from your thread and will definitely be applying them to my trading style which I'm currently journaling away in my little space here on FF. I take my key signals from the daily chart and have been entering on the hourly timeframe, but a bit like yourself (wife, 1 child and 2 fat lazy dogs) it is much more balanced if I move back to the 4 hour timeframe for entries, stops and targets. Please keep your posts coming as I for one am learning a great deal.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
HI Wattaman, You're welcome. Note that I use 2 main types of entry - one is the 50% retracement and the other is when a 4hr candle closes above (or below) yesterday's high (or low). Having said that, you would do well just trading retracements - either back to the 50% level, or back to minor support (or resistance) breakout. CHeers

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi Sunny, You're welcome mate - glad I'm not the only one with all those types of interruptions! Yes one of the reasons I started looking at the larger timeframes was to get away from the charts all the time, and to spend more time with the wife and kids. I've had too many dramas in the past watching 15m charts and the kids want to go do something or the wife wants something, or the dog wants feeding/walking etc. Yes I think this method works on many timeframes - daily and 1 hour or probably even 15m trades. One of the real keys is to recognise S/R areas, whether that's fro horizontal lines or channels for example. If you can do that (and that needs screen time to get experience), then you're half way there. Then just look for your setups, and manage the risk and multiple entries as you go. I see the euraud is finally on the move upwards which is great after my entry. Now I'll concentrate on this pair looking for other entries. When I enter a further trade I'll post the entry. It all depends on price action - I'm waiting for that retrace or a break, where I can bring up the SL from the first trade to at least be BE and zero risk. I'm also in on another trade that I'm watching carefully - not a great entry, but what that means is I have to watch my risk levels closely - I never risk more than I'm happy to lose. So I have to watch my total risk across all trades. For the euraud trade, I entered at a 3% risk, and further trades will be for a total risk of 6%, so if it's goes to my target area that will be a tidy return. Still, it can always turn around and go against me, so Risk Mgt is the key now. Cheers

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Got it. Thanks a lot. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Just thought I'd post a quick update. I've moved SL from it's original position to BE plus a few pips as price has moved 176 pips in my favour. I've placed a limit order to buy at 50% of the last big 4hr move up. But what I'm interested in currently is price is at a minor S/R area. Ideally I want to see price break through the resistance, then come back to test it, which would be a good entry.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Why you know it uptrend to place buy limit. It heavy sell on this pair base on a few day

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi all, I entered my second trade on the close of the 4hr candle. SL on T1 is moved up and is now at the same position (nearly) as T2 trade and has locked in profit.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Love, No one knows where price will go and what will happen. However, looking at the zoomed out 4hr chart below you can see the structure and a rising channel.Price had come down to support which is where I look for entries - looking for it to rise again to near the top of the channel.

Hi stevepatt Thanks for posting these areas, helps me a lot

Hi Rover, No probs - I was a bit late getting the pic uploaded - got sidetracked with something. Anyway, we'll see how it progresses. I can certainly watch the current candle closing (7pm for me) but the one after I might be in bed (11pm) - I'll see how I'm feeling! One of the things I used to be scared of was pulling the trigger. I suspect all of us are at some time in our early trading career. Now it honestly doesn't bother me - I've made T1 safe (actually locked in some profit), and now have exposure only to T2 at my predetermined risk level. It just makes trading so much less stressful! Cheers

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Here is my effort on the GBPNZD that I posted yesterday. It hasn't quite worked out 100% as I missed the 1st retrace but I'm hoping to get a 2nd entry if price comes back down to retest the trend line. Really happy with this method though - thanks Pharley.

Just a quick note about the amount of time taken to set these trades up and timeframes. I know many people new to trading forex like to trade the 15m, 5m or lower charts. It's fun and exciting! I used to be one of them. It doesn't take too long to set up your charts, but there is still much to do trading off the weekly, daily and 4hr timeframes. Sure I may have to wait a few days or so to get some good set ups, but when you're looking at even (for example) 5 or 6 pairs, there is always something to do. Plus you'll find the longer timeframes much more reliable as it's what the majority of large traders trade from. We're basically following the big money. So it's not boring - just the opposite - it's terrific to see price go in your favour of course, but then there's all the planning further entries and the risk mgt side of things. Plenty to do and it's great experience seeing and drawing the larger major S/R areas. Glad it's of use to some of the other traders on here. Good luck all.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Pharley, can you take a quick look at my chart below, please? I want to make sure that I got the Fibo right - it's still confusing me. I considered 1.08 to be the support line. So based on your idea, a buy order could have been opened some time on 30 July this would have been the first and the SL would be right below the 1.08... right? or... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi pharley Did you change your mind and enter for the second trade on the close of the big up bar rather than a pull back?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
HI mate, Yes spot on - don't forget to consider where the weekly/daily support is and resistance for targets (I haven't looked at this pair yet). But yes that's right.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi Rover, Yes - I was waiting to see if price went up and then retraced back to that minor support. It sort of happened, but not as clearly as I would have liked. So based on my normal entries, I entered at the close of the 4hr which had a good push up. As I write this, price is hanging around that minor S/R area - that's fine and somewhat expected. If it goes down now I'll win on T1 and lose on T2 - but that's the game. Never know what's going to happen - I only try to put the odds in my favour by looking at larger time frames. Cheers

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi - an update. As price has moved in my favour by 218 pips on T1 and 50 pips on T2, I've moved up the SL on both trades. Note where I've put them - the current run is a fast push up without retracing yet, so I've looked left at previous PA and put them below an important swing low in the circle. It's also below the minor S/R area that price has just gone through. If price comes back to hit SL now I still make a profit which is great - the total positions are positive and locked in. Looking for the next entry point now - probably a retrace. Cheers

--- 帖子 #206 ---
OK, thanks again. Will do

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Yep nice one pharley. I guessed that you'd put your stops there. You're giving me some confidence here, thank you. Your thread's getting some big hits by the way

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Rover, Thanks for the comments mate. Well hopefully people can see that things don't have to be complex - in fact the simpler the better (we're always hearing that!). Good that it's giving confidence mate - go for it! Patience and discipline are the keys on the personal side, S/R with sensible set ups plus risk mgt are the keys on the tech analysis side. That's how I view it so far. Cheers

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Just another quick note about luck as well - I'll well aware luck plays a part in all this. I could have the best looking set ups, entries, risk mgt etc etc, but there's something I just can't control at all and that's bad news. For example, when the CHF was pegged to the euro then de-pegged (not sure if that's the right term!), some people lost big time or gained. You never know - good long runs can be squashed by such news, or another 9/11 (God forbid), or anything. So the risk mgt side of things keeps you safe (hopefully). If you can get on a good run with good set ups, and there's no bad news to reverse the trend, that's some good luck. At the moment there doesn't seem to be bad news affecting the euraud trades, but that doesn't mean it's not hiding around the corner. Manage trades and risk and of the worst should happen, you only lose what you're happy to risk. If you've locked in profit and bad news hits, at least you can normally get out with something. There's ALWAYS more trades to be had - don't chase them, but let set ups show themselves to you, then hop on board. Cheers

Great thread ! Thanks for sharing this Pharley. I am subscribed I think what you are trading is the core of any real trading system. Levels of support and resistance on longer time frames should be included in all systems and I'm currently trying to master this myself. I'm looking forward to follow your trades and posts ! I enjoyed the article you shared on S/R levels. Is there any reason you don't start with Monthly levels before going to the Weekly TF? Right now I'm always moving from monthly to lower TF's to draw important levels. However, I used to draw too many levels (like the article mentioned). Is there a max number of pairs you trade at once? i.e. Do you max your portfolio risk % or $ at any given time? Or do you trade all setups you find? I imagine that beginning traders like me should really only keep 1 to 2 trades ongoing so we can manage them properly. This is another issue I'm having sometimes that I end up with too many pairs to watch. (The fact that I demo trade makes this a lot worse pbb) Do you only trade second / third bounces of Weekly S/R levels? Or do you consider PA setups on first rejections also? How do you handle the measured moves if the answer is yes (i.e. There is not always a previous move from S to R i think) Thanks again for sharing your system and Thanks in advance !

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I had anticipated some shorts on EURNZD on the MC / WRB + pin bar formations (Weekly chart - see below). These went against me today. Are you looking at this pair? Best,

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Tibovwh, Thanks for your questions. Let's try and answer them; I mention weekly levels as that's just my preference - I zoom out a long way to see all the relevant SR areas. I do however look at the monthly charts, but draw SR areas from the weekly charts. The reason is that I can see some major SR areas on the weekly that sometimes are hidden in the monthly charts. Max number of pairs I trade at once - once I'm on a run, I tend to just trade that one pair. I mentioned somewhere earlier I had another trade I had entered when I started trading this euraud, but I've actually closed that other trade now so I can focus on euraud and mange my risk with just these trades. I have a $ figure for total risk that I keep to. If I'm maxed out on the risk side and a retrace occurs that looks good to take, I'll try to see if I can move up any stops to reduce the $ risk I'm facing. If I can, I'll take the trade at reduced lot size thereby maintaining my overall risk. If I can't then no - I'll leave the trade aloe until I can enter again. As I say, there are always other opportunities, so I don't chase them or risk more than I should. Yes I think watching too many pairs can be a problem, especially at first. Even now I miss some good set ups because although I try and watch quite a few pairs, I still miss them - usually forget them, haven't set an alarm, forget them etc. But don't worry about it - there will be others. What works for me (and I must get better at this) is to open the charts on a Sunday, draw the monthly/weekly SR areas and look where price is for each one. Do that on 6 to 8 pairs - pick the good 'uns and not exotics. Be disciplined for each one - study one chart at a time and don't go to the next one until you've finished. Only a few minutes is required. Draw SR areas, see where price is in relation to those. If close, set up and alarm for it, or put an alarm in your mobile phone for it - anything! Then you only need to check them once per day and when trading, once per 4hrs or so. I must admit, I don't really look at any other pair when I'm actively trading 1 pair. If 6 to 8 is too much, take 4 to 6, or 2 to 4. Keep doing it though because you'll get good at it - spotting major SR areas and channels. Also look for those keep breakout and retest areas. They're almost no brainer trades to get in on (along with post weekend gaps). Re Bounces - If a previous support (for example) are has been established and price comes to that point again, I wait. I don't enter on a first rejection. I want to see what price does - it may bounce, it may break through. If it bounces then I look for a 50% retrace. Sometimes price will come all the way back and I'll lose - this is the reason why my first trade of a run is entered at half my risk. If I see a breakthrough, I wait for a retrace and retest. Normally with a bounce you can see some sort of retrace occur - it happens time and time again, so look for those. (check on past charts to train your eyes on all these things). I think I've answered them all - let me know if I've missed something! Cheers

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi again, No I wasn't looking at this one, but see my pic below which is the daily chart. I see what you mean about resistance at 1.70 area, but I have another a bit higher at 1.7115 - not too much difference really. For me, it hasn't got up to resistance yet. Plus when it gets there, then I wait to see what will happen. About removing the 1.5067 level - this would be 1.5000 level and no, I wouldn't remove it. If you look on the daily chart at the price action there, you can see price stalled at it both on the way down and on the way up, so it's a significant level. In fact you can see the breaks and retest of the S/R areas where entries could be taken. Breaks and retests are terrific, and everywhere!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Just to add sometime on time frames. I was once told by a successful trader that the Weekly time frame is quite unique, in that it's the only one that has a definite stop i.e. all markets are closed the world over on a Saturday! Daily charts can vary from broker to broker as does 4hr

Wizlon! I like it ! Great - starting to see those entry possibilities! You've got it right in terms of entries and moving up stops to minimise losses and risk. Good way to really boost some profits. It's terrific to have your earlier trades safe and not at risk as it allows you to take further entries. Remember also, when trades 1, 2, 3 SL are moved up, if you take the same risk (say 5%) on the 4th trade, your gains from T1, T2 and T3 may be more than the 5% you're riskingon T4, so you're actually not risking anything in terms of the overall account for that day or run. You're only risking on the last trade. Cheers

Hi Rover99x. I'm really enjoying your posts keep'em coming. Just wanted to clarify that most people think that the currency market (forex) is closed during the weekend, but this is not true. It is only closed to retails traders, but it is always open for the central banks and the related organizations. Currency transactions are always done electronically and can not be stopped even for one second. When the market is open and buying and selling are ongoing, then the price also goes up and down, because the price changes based on the supply and demand, and when there is supply and demand, the price changes also. That is why when the market opens to the retails traders on Sunday afternoon at 5pm EST, the price has a visible difference compared to the level it was closed on Friday afternoon. If the price opens higher than the Friday afternoon price, we will have a gap up. If it opens lower than the Friday afternoon price, we will have a gap down. Had this copied in my files from an Internet site I came across a few years ago.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Thanks Rover and Sunny for the explanation. That's why I see those pesky gaps! Mind you, I do like to trade them sometimes.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Apparently gaps that appear at market open on a Sunday night close again about 90% of the time. Gaps = good opportunities.

--- 帖子 #222 ---

Trade 3 - not really a pullback on the 4hr, but movement on the 15m - yes I don't normally go to 15m, but it's moving up quickly. Plus, both T1 and T2 are safe and in profit so I had zero risk. Also, if price comes back to hit stops for everything, the profits from T1 and T2 far outweigh a loss from T3. Took early also because I have to go sleep. Cheers

This is turning into a great thread, thanks to pharley for starting it and laying out his Support and Resistance method. I've been a member on FF for some six years now and have been trading Indices and Futures, and lately Spot FX, on and off for longer than I care to remember. And this is the only thread I've felt really able to contribute to to any meaningfully extent. One thing that I've really learnt in this business is that you have to have belief, belief in yourself and belief in your method of trading in that your method gives you an edge. This is a lonely lonely business, there's only you! You're the one that pulls the trigger.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thanks Sunny for your comments and for your better explanation on 'Big Boys' trading. One thing I would mention is that I know that Credit Suisse in London for instance don't really trade Saturdays at all, their trading floor is virtually empty then (unless situations like Greece or the Ukraine crop up). When I first started trading, mumble mumble years ago, I traded the Dax Futures (stupid I know) and I really thought then that at 5pm German time they all packed up and went home lol

This has been a phenomenal trade on EURAUD pharley EA can be like this, when it goes it really goes! It's a 330 pip day so far with no real pull back ! I was forgetting that you're on the other side of the world from me

I can't put a chart right now but there is an interesting possible trade on eurus. The resistance area is not AAA but still a valid short trade. price just wast rejected on 1.11 area so I am waiting to see if itgoes deeper and then retrace 50%. Dependind on the broker I got a pin bar or an engulf 4H.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Might be worth seeing if it breaks below the 200 EMA followed by a pullback and re-test before going short. Don't you think?

EURUSD is in a bit of a wedge. I would wait for a breakout and pullback before jumping in. Just my opinion. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

wizlon32, I prefer to keep things simple, so no indicators, oscilators,etc.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I was just referring to the trend lines mate. Price is currently near the tip of a wedge. Who knows which direction it will break out.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I know I did refer to the 200 EMA above as that was my 1st thought when I glanced at the chart. After drawing on a couple of trend lines I thern noticed the wedge. I understand that you don't like too many indicators and that you want to keep it simple but the 200 EMA is perhaps an indicator to at least be aware of as price certainly respects it. Your call mate, just trying to offer some friendly advice.

In my opinion eurus should go south 3-4 4H candles before considering anything, %. Even though the first support/demand area is not too far away, there is enough room to open 1 or two trades until this first support is reached. The problem in most of the pairs is that market hàve been very slow and quiet lately, average true range for instance on eurus drop from 110 to 80 pips in a few weeks. cheers

Hi Pharley, thanks for the explantions on the EURAUD trade. I am with you on the trade but was not able for entry 2 and 3 due to work. I also run a business and some days not at the office, that is why I like to trade the day and 4H charts. Will wait for a drawback and jump on again. It is all about the momentum! I think the discipline and pull the tricker at the right moment is another part of the work to become a succesfull trader. Hope you will come with more of these examples! Where did you place your stoploss of the 3rd trade?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi Rover, That's great to hear and for sure you're all welcome to dive in with comments, set ups, questions. You're right about believing in what you're doing. If you can learn a good, solid method of trading and look at the big picture in terms of S/R areas, then you can really start to see some positive gains. Getting an edge is hard and it's difficult to quantify. I mean, what is an edge in trading? I think if you can learn how to spot decent S/R areas and be disciplined about how you enter, what that does is put you in the correct position to take advantage of good runs - its gives you the opportunity to be in the right place. I suppose that's an edge. Yes it's been a good trade run so far Rover - but anything can happen. Plus as I mentioned before, there is an element of luck in terms of no bad news destroying the run so far. Cheers

--- 帖子 #241 ---
This is typical August trading with low volume so lower volatility. A lot of bank traders are on holiday and most western governments are on partial holiday close so not many decisions being made and lots of big traders not at their desks. Of course there's always surprises! But watch the volatility and Daily range pick up mid September/October.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi T12, Remember to always look at the bigger picture - see chart below - it's a 4hr chart showing a channel. On the daily chart you can see the channel formed. On this 4hr chart then I put the fib from the top to swing low, then I can see a 50% retrace entry at the red dotted line. Could be worth watching for further entries. Many times we see price already started on it's run through a channel or move away from major S/R areas and think - I've missed the boat on that one. And while yes it's good to get in at the start, there are plenty of opportunities to join the run after it has started. Look for those lovely retracements, 4hr candles closing above/below daily H or L, pin bars, inside bars - all this stuff during a run and try to get on board. But take your target from the bigger weekly chart and make sure there is a good Risk/reward involved. Cheers

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi Wiz, Yeah, perhaps wait for a breakout and retrace before pulling any triggers - keep your eye on it.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I like that one Wiz - coming down to channel support, probably at around 124.50 ? in a general uptrend. Definitely one to watch out for.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi Dutch, Yes it's always a problem when work gets in the way of trading! Still, you're taking the right approach by looking at the daily charts and trading mainly off those and perhaps the 4hr as well. My SL for the third entry (not a great one I admit) was below the low of the previous 4hr candle. I'll try to keep posting other examples of live trades as I do them. Also it's worth us all carrying on posting any major S/R areas that price is approaching - great to have more eyes on the job!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi pharley You were spot on when you said there is of course an element of luck in trading. Take your EURAUD trade today, China deciding to devalue the Yaun by an unprecedented amount sending the Aussie down and news on a new Greece bailout sent the Euro up, pushing EA into orbit! But you saw that trend line, you entered the market and you executed your trade for a great win. Of course it could've gone the other way and you would've taken the loss and moved on to the next trade. You have a great structure here of trade entry and exit enabling you to just 'wash rinse and repeat' because it's the long game that matters not the individual trade!

--- 帖子 #247 ---
That's it mate - you're exactly right. I wasn't really aware of the news coming along - just traded what I saw. What happens after that is anyone's guess. So there is the luck piece displayed as a good example. What we're trying to do is put ourselves in the position where we can take advantage of it with minimal risk. Yes and if a trade loses you do just move on to the next - always try to find out what went wrong with it as everything is a learning process. At the end of this run, I'll be analysing what I did right, wrong, good or bad or downright ugly! But sure, rinse and repeat. Cheers

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Interesting pin bar on the 4hr that I don't like - see chart below with minor resistance shown. So my options are to cash out now all my trades or keep it going to play out. Looking at the 1 day chart it had a great move up so I'm not surprised to see either consolidation or retraces happening. I will just ride things out and let it run. My T1 and T2 trades are in profit and not at risk. T3 is at risk, but minimal with T1 and T2 profits more than covering any loss from T3. So now it's time to do nothing - you've probably heard that a million times. There are many times in forex that you're actually not doing anything. Yes I'll monitor the charts to see if further entries can be taken. We'll see how it goes. Cheers

Yep pharley To quote a very famous trading book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator 'It's the sitting on my hands and doing nothing that made me the most money'

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi all, Ok the run is over after it hit all my TP targets. This morning the euraud went up fast, and with all my trades at BE or locking in profit I bought a further 1 trade until it went up to TP. Results are: Overall pip move during the run from bottom to my TP target was about 480 pips. Pips gained from all trades = 900 % of account gained = 59.9% Total trades = 4 Days length of run (from first trade to exit) = 2.5 days Account Risk level initially 3%, then 6% to 7% So I'm very happy with that result, especially gaining 60% in 2.5 days. Probably could have done better with gains but the pair had 2 quick moves which didn't leave to much time for retraces and further entries. Ok, I'll do some analysis of my trades this coming weekend to see the good and the bad. Now on to the next one! Got to go analyse some charts and find the next one. I hope it's apparent that for normal risk you can achieve some terrific gains. This has been one of the drivers for me putting together this method - seeing terrific returns and at first thinking "they must be taking huge risks". But it's not the case - keep risk reasonable and manage it well and if you do the analysis and get on a good run, terrific returns are possible. Now rinse and repeat - once per month if you can, or perhaps every 2 or 3 weeks if there are set ups, and your trading pot really starts to grow seriously quickly. Cheers

Hi Rtm, Just finished a live trade example. Cheers

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Great work mate and all in real time, too. Really inspiring as you keep it nice and simple and leverage off of your ability. No hurry for the next one, let it come to you.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Well done pharley!!! It seems you got R:R of 10:1 for this 4 trades in total!! Usually how much you risk on single trade? Would you add position when in profit or the position starts to against you? Would you at any one time trade multiple pairs or find the best pair?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
HI mate, Thanks - hope it provides some inspiration and knocks some doubters on the head about what can be done. Yes I'll have a slow look around the charts and see if anything looks interesting. Otherwise I'm in no hurry - I can wait for the set ups. Cheers

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Happy, Thanks - yes it was a nice run of a few hundred pips. I'm always on the look out for those types of set ups. Normally I risk about 3% or 4% on the first trade then 6% to 8% on the remainder. I add to positions when in profit - normally when price action shows me another point to enter. I don't like adding to positions when it goes against me - it's more difficult to manage the overall risk, and I like to keep the risk constant. Normally when I find a good run to get on, I just trade the 1 pair - just concentrate on that one to make the most out of it. Perhaps I'm hopeless at multi-tasking! Nah, really I like to put my focus on the 1 pair that I'm trading. Cheers

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi Pharley, good trade!! I have only half of your result but still good! You show me how to get the most out of a trade with low risk! Perfect. Only a few trades a month would be enough

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Pharley, Absolutely outstanding is all I can say! I think you have shown us all the way to go. Very inspiring. I think that besides the basic strategy one of the most important things that you said is that you just concentrate on 1 pair at a time. This way you are properly investing your attention (plus a bit of time) and not just your money and I think that is also key to success. Up until now, even when I have been in a trade I have always been on the lookout for more and at times this has caused me to over-trade and inevitably pick some (plenty) losers. From now on I am going to properly invest my attention. Thanks, Wiz

Hi pharley Nice work mate A word about your TPs, were they all at 90% of the last swing down on the Daily?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi all, Many thanks for your comments - that run turned out very well and or sure there's luck involved. They're not all like that, but at least we can be in position to take advantage of them when they go. Dutch - how come only about half of that - number of pips different or risk different or different trades? Wiz and T12 - I used to do exactly the same! - I was trying to look at multiple pairs when I should have been concentrating on the one I was trading. There are a few possible trades knocking around including the one relaxtrading (thanks for spotting it mate) quoted above. However, I'm particularly interested in this one below. You'll notice that my SL is below the fib 0% level - I just felt it needed more room to breathe. Oh - a break of the resistance and retrace showing. No idea where things will go at this stage, but:

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi Rover and thanks, Actually price moved that quickly that I moved the TP up slightly to gain another 25 pips on each trade. Not always recommended, but I was in front of the charts and was able to do that - as I moved them I also moved up all the SL to capture maximum pips. Cheers

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I find interesting to open the first trade 3% and then increasing on the following new trades as you point out, however it will be also logical to reduce lots % when price is getting near Tprofit. So something like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4 ,3%. Therefore, highest risk trade should be at half way to the final target. The closer to the S/R the higher chances to get a rejection. my two cents😊

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Good point Relax, Yes it's always good to think of the risk. It really depends on how you want to manage them. I tend to stop entering trades if I can't get at least 1:2, risk:reward out of it and I try to get all trades SL to BE or profits locked in before entering again. But for sure it's worth thinking about how you want to manage trade risks as the multiple entries unfold. In fact, not worthwhile, but critical !! Cheers

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Pharley, when you get the chance can you just elaborate a little on how you made your decision to start your new fib where you did on the EURJPY you've just posted. I understand you're looking for a H4 close beyond a certain level but would like to know why you started it where you did. Cheers Sunny

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Pharley, EURJPY is aproaching an important supply zone so I don'T see much room there. would be safer wait for a deeper retrace? at least something around 137.00 ?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Relax, Thanks mate and I see what you're saying - on the daily chart that could look a bit tight, but I'm taking cues from the weekly. See chart below. You can see a weekly trend line coming down and a strong weekly candle up crossing over the resistance. If you look at the weekly candle before that, you can see a pin bar and even earlier can see bounces off the rising trend line. Price broke through the resistance line and stayed above it with a close of a 4hr candle. Then there's been a 4hr pin bar as well. Also the previous monthly high has been taken out. All this stuff catches my eye as a potential trade northwards. If it keeps going up it will probably stall at that previous supply area, but the strong move up on monthly and weekly candles tells me there may be a continuation upwards. Also on the monthly candles, when price was at that supply level, price didn't come down dramatically the same as for example January this year (monthly candle). We never know what's going to happen, but I'm basing trades off what I see on the large timeframes and price action around key areas. Anyway, risk mgt is key and we can lose at any time so I try to make sure my losses are small compared to gains when they come. Cheers

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Pharley, agree with you. If we are considering weekly chart and the price manage to surpass 139-140 area, plenty room until 150.00.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Pharley, have you got a pending order around 138.30?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Fingers crossed mate - plenty of pips on a run like that!

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi - no, that's the first entry already taken.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi Pharley, that is because I stepped in a little later then you at 1.48531 and exit at 1.52345 and I did not have the 2nd and 3rd trade only the 4th from 1.51205 and exit at 1.52357. Will follow the next trades!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Big balls on this one Pharley! I 'll be waiting for a deeper retracement.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
HI Dutchips, Ah I see. It's good you got some pips out of that! I think that if you can start to trade like that, it's like anything - practice and you'll get better at it. Soon you'll be running up hundreds of pips! What I can say about this way of trading - if you find it successful as I do, and you can learn how to do it, you'll always know how to do it. Plus it will work in any market condition - price action tends to operate well in virtually market conditions. If not this method, then find a good solid PA based method and stick with it, practice it, master it - that's the only way to be successful at trading this game we like so much! Cheers

--- 帖子 #275 ---
LOL, well I like the look of it and as the first entry, it's at a minimal risk level. Cheers

--- 帖子 #276 ---
USDCHF shows a possible retrace from 0.99. W1 forms a bearish harami (if the price will drop more), D1 a long bearing candle and on H4 price doesn't seem to stop falling anytime soon. Anyone waiting for this move? Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi Wattaman, Just a quick look tells me it was in a rising channel previously - could be heading down to the lower part of the channel perhaps? Draw in some trend lines and look at major S/R areas to see where it might get to. Cheers

--- 帖子 #278 ---
You're right, there is a channel. And a support around 0.95, somewhere. So we should probably wait to see if these will stand the price- if it will drop further- and then look for the 50% retrace to enter (+ the other signals, candles, etc)?!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi Pharley, I find this a very good and solid method once you learn the rules and PA. Indeed it is a matter of practice over and over again and learn from mistakes. I tend to look for trades where the price is extreme to the upside or downside (I use TMA indicator for this) and once I found an extreme then to trade it like your system. Soo we will see..... anything can change......I spend 10 month study the forex and at least I know now where I want to go....... Glad I see you trade only one pair at the time. My idea is to have maybe only 1 to 2 trades a week.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi Wattaman, Yes price has come down to that lower channel. It's come down a bit from major resistance (horizontal) on a weekly chart and just crossed back through a sloping down trend line. It's not clear to me yet what it may do - so if it's not clear I just wait. I only try and trade the clearest signals I can - those tend to be the safest. We're cherry picking the best set ups. Cheers

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi Wiz, Looks interesting mate - probably target 126.50 if you're going short.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Was going to target a bit lower Pharley. I thought it might make 124.50. You don't agree?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Ah I see what you've seen now. You might be right!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Oh no-one knows! We're all guessing most of the time, or using some basic PA principles to take a best guess at what price will do. Hard to do that, so just trade what you see. If it works out that's great! If not then let your risk mgt take care of the downside and don't worry about it. I haven't had too much time to look through charts since ending the last run - I tend to try and have a break from them after such runs, or if I'm looking at them, I don't spend too long at it. Weekend is the time I generally have a good scout around. Earlier I was talking about cherry picking the best trades. Set ups that I particularly look out for are horizontal S/R and rising or falling channels. I particularly like breakouts of S/R and retraces to the breakout area. Terrific to trade and really just bog standard PA set ups. It's amazing how often support becomes resistance and vice versa. For me they're must take trades especially if in line with longer term trends. Anyone else got some fave set ups they look for? Cheers

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hey Malcolm, it's Nial here ... This is an important message about using the correct style of forex charts to trade my price action strategies. Many of you are using a broker that probably has the 'wrong' style of charts, and it's big problem... you can read more about this here . Here's the problem in a nutshell... myself and other professionals use ' New York Close Charts '. This style of chart shows 5 true daily bars with the 'open and close' of the price bars falling in line with the New York trading session. Sadly, many of you are using GMT charts or charts with 6 daily bars. (both these charts are wrong and will create problems). I wrote an article on this problem here . You can't possibly see the correct price action signals without having a true 5 day chart which closes and re-opens in line with the new york trading session. This is the same style of chart that professionals use to trade and you need to be sure your looking at the same price data to accurately analyze the price action. You can get the correct charts we use here ... http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/forex-trading-tools/forex-trading-broker-platform talk soon, Nial Fuller What do u think ,???

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi T12, Yeah, Nial sent me the same message a few years ago. I try and get as closely aligned as possible to that time as well. My previous broker had their day finish coinciding with EOD NY. My current one doesn't but I can set the server time to be the same. At the moment I'm less bothered by this - I'm looking at the big picture S/R areas and am only interested in candle shapes when price gets to these areas. I still retain my previous brokers platform so I can check what a candle looks like at EOD. To be honest, it doesn't have that much difference between my previous broker and the one I use now. It's important depending on how out of sync your broker servers are. Best to check candles at EOD and see they stack up. CHeers

Hi T12, I don't think I understand your question. SL is determined by price action, so I normally place mine at swing highs or swing lows. I'ts not a calculated point, but a point where we think that if price get's back to there, then we're probably wrong about the trade. My calculations come about from the size of the SL in pips and my risk level - that dictates how many lots I can buy. Cheers

Hi JimbobJonez, I've had a look at the chart. I don't normally trade this pair due to lower volatility. But I post a week and day chart. If price breaks up from the trendline coming down, then I'd wait for a retrace to it and if everything is confirmed, probably try a target of 0.7370. If it gets past that, and then 0.7450, then it's open for 0.7760. But price may drop again first from the resistance area down to 0.6950. Price is down at a level you can see on my chart between 0.71845 and 0.70144 - these come from way back in 2003 and 2004 (not drawn by me perfectly!). Price stuck around there for some time, so I'm not sure what it will do this time. As it's at a weekly falling resistance, if I were to trade this I'd look to go short. But as I say I don't normally trade this one. Thanks for the question! Cheers

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Now I'm really just looking for my next good set up - I'll do some analysis over the weekend. I'll try to target a decent return and good pips (another 60% would be nice!), but you never know, might be better or worse! Cheers

Hi pharley You wrote a great line here:- ' Oh no-one knows! We're all guessing most of the time, or using some basic PA principles to take a best guess at what price will do. Hard to do that, so just trade what you see. If it works out that's great! If not then let your risk mgt take care of the downside and don't worry about it.' That's why you need good structure for your analysis and entries, and good risk management for the many times you're not right and, IMHO, you have it here pharley! Watch Bloomberg, they're all guessing ........ lol BTW are you still in EURJPY ?

Can anyone explain to me what the Shouts thing is on your profile? What's it for? And while I'm at it, what's this little yellow flag thing by my name? It says medium impact member (top 5%) - I don't understand that either!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi Rover mate, Yes I'm still in that trade - I'm up all of about 10 pips or so! It just hasn't moved since I entered. Never mind - I'll keep an eye on it and if there is something better to enter, I'll close it down and move focus. Yes, the more I looked at analysts and tried to take on board what they say, I realised they can be just as wrong as me! Always worth doing your own analysis - I hardly read anything from DailyFX and the like anymore. I just trade what's on the charts and keep practising/learning all I can about S/R and PA. After I sorted out how I was going to manage risk, my trading has become so much more relaxed! I can't believe the difference - no more worrying at night trying to sleep because I've over leveraged! Lol - I can laugh about it now, but for sure I've spent many sleepless nights in the past, having to get up in the middle of the night and check trades and charts. Now for sure, I really don't worry about it - if I'm risking 3% up to 7% for example, I can take quite a few wrong ones before getting a good run, and then the gains far outweigh any losses. It's true what they say - get the risk mgt side of things really sorted - master how you're going to manage your risk, especially if you're in multiple trades like I do. Otherwise it's gets scary pretty quick! Master setups, S/R risk - all that good advice from Nial Fuller and Lance Beggs has really paid off. Cheers

Hey Pharley...this is an excellent thread! Well done for starting it mate. This is the first one I have subscribed to in FF and I couldn't stop from making my first post. I believe PA on S/R is the simplest strategy and provides great R:R ratio. I think your strategy to enter trade on 50% retrace of Daily candle in 4H chart and more importantly adding trades as it goes in your favour is great and seems to work well. Also, the strategy is great for traders who have a day job as it does not require frequently looking at charts. I find it very useful and it would help me in establishing the missing link between entering trade and taking good profit. Looking forward to happy trading.... AA

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi mate - good to have you on board. You say it all in your profile - PA and keep it simple. That's all I try to do - analyse the PA and S/R, enter multiple times and manage the risk. Great news if it can help you get some cracking trades! Cheers

For anyone struggling with Fib settings here is a link to quite a handy tool. If I remember correctly I think you need to sign up before you can get it but it doesn't cost you anything. It doesn't come with a 50% level but there is a 48.6 level which is close enough. You can use it to quickly add and delete levels that you don't want etc and change the colour if you want to. http://tradingarsenal.com/indicators...indicator.html Attached Image (click to enlarge)

hi Pharley Are you still Long on EURJPY?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Yes mate - down about 2 or 3 pips as I write this!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Pharley, do you ever use the 38.2 or 61.8 Fib levels for entries if you get a valid PA signal at that level?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
No, I use the 50%. Sometimes it doesn't get to the 50% level, but I don't mind - I'll wait for the next set up to appear, either another retrace or a close on the 4hr above yesterday high. There was one I did not long ago (I think I posted a pic of it) where price retraced to the 50% level, but I wasn't able to take it - wasn't in front of the screen to see the set up. (I normally set pending orders to get in at that level when I see a retrace happening or even before). So I just waited, and the next 4hr candle closed in the correct direction, but not too far away from what would have been the 50% entry, so I entered at that point. I had to adjust the lot size to maintain the risk level, but that's fine as long as I DO look after the risk. But there's nothing to say you couldn't use those levels. I'm just happier using the 50.

First supply zone 138 then the important one 137.35, that will be a good place to enter.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Yes, I see what you mean. Below is the same but with a weekly resistance turned support I have - that's the reason I entered. Hopefully it will retrace to the breakout point and bounce up. If not, never mind - minimal risk taken. Oh news is out in 3 or 4 mins.

Hi Relaxed, can you explain how you are seeing these areas please?

I would just like to add my two pence worth on Supply/Demand and Support/Resistance (that's an excellent pdf file on that thread btw relaxtrading) I have a trading buddie that very successfully trades SD using futures data, and I believe that on futures it can work well but on spot FX I'm not so sure (just an opinion) therefore try as I might I cannot get his method to work on my trading. So at the end of the day, for me, it's SR using horizontal lines or diagonal trend lines, which is what drew me to pharley's thread in the first place. Therefore IMHO study both and pick the one that you believe will work for you! That's why I believe you have to find a trading methodology that suits your personality BTW EJ's now beginning to move up in the US session Just as a footnote, my buddie uses volume with his SD trading, now volume on Spot FX is synthetic which is why he uses Futures data where it's real

Can you share your indi?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi, The Supply Demand (SD) way of trading is very valid and is very much related to trading with Support Resistance (SR). When you think about it, trading using SR is virtually the same - we're both spotting areas in the market where supply or demand becomes strong or weak. The main difference seems to be that in SD, those areas are identified and trades taken as price gets to them with SL placed at the other end of the area, or trades taken with confirmation as price moves to the area then away from it. Using SR we're using these areas to identify a place where we want to watch for price action candles to tell us when to enter, whether it's a pin, engulfing, or a range of candles, the momentum leading up to it etc, and a confirmed move away. If I were trading SD, I'd still look for PA in the candles at those areas as confirmation - a mixture of the two. But really, not a million miles difference between the two methods. Both relying on studying the charts, looking for areas of strength and weakness. Relaxtrading and others, if you're finding that SD works for you and you prefer it, that's great! Go for it, and I also encourage others to read up about it. Never stop learning. You'll find a method that works for you and fits in with how you want to trade. Now back to that pesky eurjpy trade - it's been open for a couple of days now and only moved down then up, currently at about +45 pips. Well, it's either going to go on a run or come back and hit my SL. Patience and discipline not to interfere with it. SL and lot size is at a place where any loss would be minimal, so I'm happy to leave it alone. Cheers

Hi all, I am following this thread closely and combining insights from TMS method also that I have been learning. So the indicator on the chart you can ignore safely. I got into EURJPY trade with 4 positions so far and another limit buy order on the break of swing high. (See pic below) If it doesn't break I still have some pending buy orders on further retracement. On the Weekly / Daily chart is there a possible AB=CD ? I see partial PT at 141 but a lot of potential above with next Resistance 150 ? Best,

CHFJPY 126 RN + Resistance on Daily chart. (Unfortunatly not on weekly). Confluence with 200 EMA. Trend has been long for years. Can we consider 11 Aug as a bullish bar? 12 Aug is an inside bar - A very small range one also. Break of 12 Aug IB would coincide with trendline break. But ideally I think 11 Aug high is safer to trade ? I'm looking closely for a break north ! Do you agree ? Best,

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi Tibovwh, Thanks for your posts. However, I just don't trade like this at all and some of the things you've put on I have no idea what you're talking about. What's a PT, a RN etc. And I don't look for AB=CD etc etc. Charts - oh I like them empty - I don't even use MAs. My approach is very, very simple and when I see charts with lines and squiggles all over them, I normally don't even look. I like to see price plus S/R. Everything else for me is just cluttering up the screen. But if it's working for you that's great - my old eyeballs can't take the pain! Cheers

Hi pharley,I agree that simple chart is the best.I myself trade mostly based on PA and S/R.Each one of us has our own system, as long as it makes money, why not?Happy green pips!

Yes that's right mate - everyone is different and if something is working for someone, then go for it and good luck. I just prefer to keep it simple like yourself. But I used to have charts like that - full of indies &amp; MA's, now honestly, if I see them I don't even look as I just can't see the price clearly. Cheers

Any advice on this NJ set up...i took it on !hr chart...just want to crosscheck if am doing the right thing. I seem to have many S/r lines...do you think those are ok...took them off weekly chart... Thanks in advance for your input and thank you once again for sharing your way of trading

The idea of adding, scaling in, instead of, scaling out, is correct...proven to work positively on your bottom line. Scaling out, which means , once in profit, take out half (or any part), and continue with "money from the markets",is very common, but works against your bottom line....it just makes you "feel better..." Why it´s wrong?: because you make sure you take any initial loss with a full load, but your best target is only reached with half or less. Bill Williams , in his second book, has a system that would add positions, based on several indicators, sometimes 20 times....It would multiply the winners.It failed on choppy markets. Overall profitable... The idea is to take out all the juice from a trend....

--- 帖子 #353 ---
The biggest risk to this stategy....is the Big Boys with their stop hunting machines. They can read the stop zones, ( so called "liquidity pools"), and send their programmed robots to hit them, that is the liquidity they need, to push the market in the direction they want... 6 Big Banks own 70% of the FOREX volume(you can Google the exact numbers), and they do manipulate....addd broker slippage (manipulation), news spikes (manipulation), and you get the perfect retail meat served on the plate for the Big Boys.... day in, day out.. What I try, is to enter where everybody has the stop...(obvious places). Maybe, people using this strategy, could add that, to their arsenal of triggers...:nerd: Heres an Aussie 4 H chart, notice the stop runs I marked, just befroe every big swing....it happens on every time frame, the smaller the more it happens...market hits the last majour swing where retaliers are ususally "trailing", by just a few pips (it costs them money and effort to do that)... Then it flies away, with the retail money...

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi all - wow there are lots of messages and comments. I'll try to get through them. Cuchuflito - thanks for your comments. Note that the risk is only the risk you're willing to take and I start initially with half my normal risk - normally 3%, then 6% for further trades. I could use 1% then 2% or anything. I understand what you mean by SL hunts - that's one of the reason I moved away from market maker brokers to ECN and haven't had a problem with that since moving. Sure there can still be some swings that take out stops by moving just that few pips extra, but that's why I normally wait for confirmation of a move, good PA candles/set up appearing etc. Yep there is risk in any method of trading, so the idea is to minimise risk. When I have trade numbers 2, 3, 4 etc in place, normally all my risk from earlier trades is taken off the table as SL is place at BE or better, thereby locking in profits. Actually on the last run, I think by T3 and T4, even if price comes back to hit SL, T1 and T2 profits would have more than covered losses of T3 and T4 so I still end up with a gain. It's crucial to manage your risk so you've never overexposed. Cheers

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi Aaeran, I don't have that pin appearing on my 4 hr chart - must be different server times. But on yours it looks interesting and sure the target is fine. It's probably better to try and enter off major S/R areas - see daily and 4hr charts below for an entry after price touch a lower rising trend line/channel. This is the type of thing I look for - in this example, price came back to within a whisker of SL, but then pulled away and would be in profit by about 200 pips by now. Remember to really analyse those weekly and daily charts to try and find the major S/R areas to get trades from.Good experience though! In terms of a continuation trade taking 50% retracements to get in, have a look at the third pic below. Ideally what I want to see is price moving above a previous swing high - in this case it hasn't so I'd not take that one. It may still work out just fine - you never know! But by taking these types of retracements trades after price has moved higher, you're putting the odds further in your favour that price will continue on its move upwards. Hope that explains what I see there. Cheers

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi, Yes that USDCAD is hanging around a resistance turned support off way back on the monthly chart at 1.306 - could be interesting to watch if it breaks away northwards!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi Rover - yeah hanging, hanging. Not much happening for me on the charts just yet. Mind you I only normally do some analysis tomorrow (Sunday) and haven't checked through them yet. I'm hanging out to see a good channel trade again - oh I like those!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi nogames, Thanks for the question. I don't normally trade off the 1 hr charts, but have posted some things below - a weekly, 4hr and 1 hr chart. You can see the lines I've drawn on those for major S/R - I can't see really where your lines are coming from. Just start with a blank chart on the weekly and identify the major S/R areas that price is currently near. Most often I don't bother with ones further away until price moves a fair way. I see a slight channel there and perhaps if yo're going to trade the 1hr, then wait until price gets to either side of the channel and wait for a confirmation signal of price turning. These signals are better off the longer timeframe such as daily - I normally try to identify good confirmation candles from the daily chart before moving down to 4hr charts for entry. Cheers

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Risk - I normally risk 3% to 6%, but sometimes up to 8% when I'm trading (always half on the first trade), but you could use 1% and 2% or 3% for example. The good runs I'm looking for will still make around 20% with the lower risk figures. The idea is to stay in the game so you're able to trade. Also, if a SL hunt comes along, you're only losing a small amount that you're comfortable with. We can't control what the brokers do, but we can control how much we would lose. I've been SL hunted before with market maker brokers, and I didn't like it at all ! So now the risk mgt side of things is very much a core part of how I trade. Once I realised that for say 4% risk you can achieve gains of 30% to 60% in a single run, that's the way I went and I'm just sticking to it. Took me a while to find it! There's always a method that everyone can find that they're happy with. From my experience I see accounts blown up and people leave forex because of exactly one thing - the risk. Just using too much (I've done it myself a couple of times!). Also the patience and discipline - just got to have it. When I was trading as a newbie, I would read similar things to what I've just said above, and think "yeah yeah, I'll get around to that", then completely forget it and carry on trading how I wanted with too much leverage and no risk mgt. I wish I could get hold of myself from about 8 years ago and say this - "there are heaps of methods that work, just learn one, but the most important thing to learn is how to manage the risk". Happy trades everyone!

Nicely put pharley Thanks

Hi pharley; I guess I'm looking more for Supply/Demand Levels, speaking for myself I find it difficult to locate Support/Resistance accurately because finding levels can be ambiguous. I look for Weekly Swing Points and mark the first Week that indicates a Bearish or Bullish Swing. It's a matter of looking as far to the left as you need to go before finding a significant Swing Point. Often a significant Weekly or Monthly Swing Point will continue to have an influence on the Market well into the future. As you have said it's down to the individual to find what suits them best and then Trading what they are comfortable with. I must admit beyond this point your way of entering a Trade and Trade Management seems very logical. Because of time limitations I enter Trades from the Daily Charts. I'm going to be away for a week or so but when I'm back I'll be concentrating on this method of Trading more closely.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Thanks Stevepatt for your explanation! I think Supply&amp;Demand is similar to Support and Resistance! Resistance lines should also be on points from where big move up or down start.

I've been Hi Pharley, I study the charts to practice your method and look for al kinds of situations that can occur and how I could react. Lots of questions come to the surface and I kindly want to ask you to answer some questions. Attached are two charts of the EURAUD somewhere sept.2014. The first chart are the weekly resistance points and the second chart the daily chart with the following questions: 1. If there is a strong move down breaking the weekly resistance without a good PA candle but with a 50% retracement, see point 1 on the chart, would you see this as an entry? 2. Would you see the break through resistance in the upmove, see point 2, as a good entry? 3. In point 3 we have the situation that the move is not strong enough to hit weekly target but it hits a formed daily target several times, this is a situation you see a lot of times especially on demand levels. (forming of channels). How would you trade this? Take profit at the daily resistance? or take the BE and start again. 4 and 5 . These situations can take about 2 month!! Would you stay so long in a trade? I hope these questions may also serve others that are learning the forex with your method. Thanks a lot for your time and effort!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
... Ignored Hi Dutchpips; Here's how i would look at it more from a Supply/Demand angle. I'm sure Pharley will give you his angle also. If my use of Supply/Demand is causing any confusion just ignore it and carry on.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hi Stevepatt, Thanks for your reaction and explanations . Your charts give a very good overview as far as S&amp;D areas and the market reacts on these zones. As I see it supply and demand work with zones and SR with lines. Where do you place your orders? You work with PA? and where do you put your SL. I experience this (entry, sl, exit) as the most challenging. To search for a strategic entry and SL. Here are the S&amp;R lines very helpfull. Place the order just above the line and SL under the line and stick to the PA and fibo rules. Do you only work with S&amp;D and on daily charts? or do you also work with some indicators to determine the best entry? Have a look at my chart AUDJPY. Is this what you mean? And you trade this from the daily timeframe? Could be an idea to combine the S&amp;R with the D&amp;S.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Pharley so you get out from your trades if they hit targets of 90 percent or if they go to stoplos. Is there another way you interrupt your trades if trend changes ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi Dutchpips; I've been bouncing around looking at different Methods of Trading recently trying to really pin down a complete Trading Plan. I've been combining different things that work for me and Weekly Candles that initiate a Weekly Swing Level is something I've been working on for a while these just happen to make good Levels of Supply/Demand. The Levels I find to Trade from might be slightly different to Pharley's, but as far as how to Trade from these Levels is concerned just follow Pharley's rules. If you have the time, to do it, by dropping down to H4 Charts you should be able to find entries with tighter Stop Losses. I haven't got the time so I Trade from D1. I liked Pharley's approach to Trading but have never really got on with Support/Resistance/TrendLines because I find placing them too ambiguous. The AUD/JPY Chart looks good to me just wait for PA around these Levels and Trade from one level of Supply/Demand to the next.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi all, oooh questions again! I like them!. Here we go - Thanks for your posts Steve. Its terrific to have the contribution and explanation of what youre looking at from the Supply Demand (S/D) point of view. I read quite a bit of differing views on S/D vs Support Resistance (S/R) trading half the time it seems that its similar to 2 scientists working on the same thing but disagreeing on the method and evidential data. I never think of it like that. Here is what I think about S/D and S/R:- Without S/D there would be no S/R areas. The S/R areas can only be marked on a chart as a consequence of S/D. Here's why -if there were no S/D for a stock or currency, the price just wouldnt move at all. Basic economics 101 - if there is no demand for a product, then there will be no supply of it.A company would go bust spending money on production and not having any sales. If a product is made and there is a small demand, but then price is reduced so it's cheaper and perceived as good value, people normally buy more. I know I do (particularly with engine oil for the car and chocolate!). This is applicable to forex price can get high and there are less people willing to enter long trades. Traders see a stall, see the price isnt moving up and then get out of long positions thereby creating sell positions. Traders seeing price move down may be tempted to also sell at that price and with the liquidity of forex being so deep (very), this can be done. When price comes back to an area where traders thought of it as good value previously, they might buy again thus creating S/D areas on charts. What were doing with S/R (whether you realise this or not), is looking to; a) map out these extremities (or near) of S/D areas with a line or two, and b) look within a S/D area for price action setups to trade. When I analyse charts for S/R areas on the weekly and daily, in effect Im looking for those S/D areas then marking lines within those for clues to future movement. Both S/R and S/D traders are watching out for when price comes back to those areas. S/D traders would typically enter either when price gets into that area or moves away from it again with confirmation candles, placing stops at the other side of the S/D area. S/R traders are looking for price to get back to the area and then look for PA setups on candles in relation to our drawn S/R lines for entries. Both S/D and S/R are looking at market structure to map it out - important bit that! Always try to look at these areas on the larger timeframes. Price will react in some way at these areas - consolidate before reverse, break through, breakthrough and retrace. Good article: http://www.maximumlots.com/supply-an...nd-resistance/ Cheers

Hi - yes I leave trades alone to hit SL or move away in my favour. I tend not to interfere with them once underway.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
... Ignored Hi Dutch, Thanks for the questions mate - here's my thoughts: I attach pics of euraud weekly, daily, 4hr charts. On the weekly I draw the S/R areas - have a look at the first pic on the weekly - see the support line formed at 1.38577 - this is why I draw the support line there. And also look at the resistance line at 1.42254. Both identified some times back on the weekly. Now on the second pic, daily, and we can see price had come down to 1.42254 support line, then broke through it you can see in the circle it retraced back to that point, so let's see what its like for entries on a 4hr chart. On the 4hr chart - it looks complex with lines everywhere - I've only got them on there to show a few possible entry points, which are: Point A) - This is a potential entry on the 4hr as a retrace back to the break area; Point B) - After a move down, this is a potential entry as a 50% retrace; Point C) - The dotted yellow line shows another type of entry - just like the major support break and retry, a minor support (yellow line) broke and price then retraced to it - more or less where the major 50% retrace was, but a different reason to entry short. In answer to your second question - In the 4th pic you can see a daily chart. Price didn't retrace the 50%, but it did retrace to just about where the major support was and also the falling channel that had been created earlier. This is also a good entry. I'll answer the others ones soon - I need to look at the charts longer and grab a coffee!

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Dutch, Please see pics below. This is how I would have traded it - note that T1 gets quite a few pips, but T2 and T3 loses, with all SL being taken out when price comes back. (Also note that this is always difficult to be objective with hindsight trading). (Also, also note that I also look for pin bars, inside bars, engulfing, break of resistance and retrace to support etc). If that happens, I then stop trading and analyse the chart closely on the daily. In effect I'm looking for another good set up - that may be another pair altogether. But analysing this pair, yes there is a daily minor resistance that price is hitting - I'd leave it alone or even trade back to major support. At major support I'd try again. It doesn't matter if there are several losing trades at first - (my earlier GBPJPY trades also lost until it eventually got away for big gains). That's because; 1) I'm taking minimal risk on the first trade, 2) Risk is managed all the time through lot size and SL placements, 3) When I'm on a good run, I'll make back all the small losses and normally a large amount more, by having multiple entries and risk reward levels of around 1:10. Regarding length of trade - yes for sure I'd wait. I manage trades throughout the life of the run and they either hit targets or hit SL. As I've said previously, once you can get 3 or so trades in to profit, you're covering any losses you may take on the latest trade. Hope that helps. Cheers

Hi Pharley, I tried to test the EurAud and it was actually difficult to place the stop loss or add trades in retrace even in backtest, if done live would probably have only taken one trade with take profit hit. I would love to know how to manage this as it is obviously a real skill, it is difficult for me even with back testing, just added two additional trades but results speak for themselves risked 5% for gain of 51.3%, more than 10 to 1 RR. Any pointers or experience appreciated.

What are your thought on this Pharley? I am looking for a buy signal at or around the 200 EMA or a support line in that area (I know you don't use indicators but I think the 200 EMA adds weight to my view). The last weekly candle shows a big retrace. The last daily candle seems to have broken a resistance line although it does seem to be in the middle of a S/R area.

Hi Pharley, Thank you very much. This explains a lot! Thank you for this detailed explanation! The entry is the most difficult part of the trade and surely multiple entries. I am very happy with your detailed explanation because it shows me I have to study the chart in detail and everything that is going on there including minor resistance and channels. Although I understand it is not completely objective because of the hindsight trading, it is always good to look through the eyes of the master! Thanks again and I hope you will give more of these explantions in the future!! A.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Stevepatt, thanks for the explanations, they are really helpfull. This thread is blessed with good teachers!! If you only trade the daily how do you deal with your SL, would probable be &gt;200 pips. I also prefer trading the daily charts, it gives me time to study the charts and Pharley is teaching us to get the most out of a trade through multiple trades and risk management! It is not about the amount of pips but more can you be consistent in your trading. You understand what I mean?

I'll echo that Dutch, thankyou pharley for your detail. Also thanks to stevepatt for a look at the SD side

HI Alamhakim, Please see attached 2 pics - the first one is a 4hr - going from bottom to top, my entries are at the yellow lines and there are 4 of them. On the 1 hr chart you can see the red line at top where I exited the trade. A 1 hour candle closed down below a previous bull candle and I decided to stop them there. Originally I had a TP which was lower than that for all trades, but was able to watch the charts as price moved up quickly, so I removed the TP to let the trades run. T1 was at 50% retrace T2 was close of 4hr candle above yesterday high T3 was taken on a retrace back to minor support T4 taken as it broke above a recent minor swing high - see it on the 1hr chart. Cheers

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi Pharley, Thanks so much for your excellent thread! Also, thanks for taking the time to do all your educational posts - they're extremely helpful. I was just wondering if you're looking at getting a 4HR long entry on GBPUSD or whether you're just focusing on EURJPY at the moment?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thankyou Pharley, I understand how the trades were entered and exited very clearly. Can you please show your Stop loss movements in the trades to manage the risk? Thus part I find difficult.Am in trades for Eur Aud and Eurgbp, I will try to use these skills.Thanks againAlam

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Pharley,I will try and manage this trade the same way hopefully.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi mate, At the moment even though I'm in a eurjpy trade, I haven't looked too closely at what's happening on the charts. I probably will after I've posted a couple of things. I did have a look yesterday (normally day for analysing charts), but then got dragged away to do a few things. I'll check out the GU and see what I think. Cheers

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi again, Here are some pics to try and show where I put SL as I entered trades.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I forgot an important one - after the second trade and price was moving upwards, I moved SL from T1 and T2 to this position:

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi Wiz, Both the NZDUSD and AUDCAD seems to be in a consolidating phase - well, not moving anyway! I'd leave them alone until they get going. Plus on the AudCad there doesn't seem to be too much room before a target - certainly under 1:2 risk reward. I try and look for the clearest signals - if I can see them, then others can too - and try to only trade those. Cheers

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thought I'd post an update of that eurjpy long trade I took - I did say I'd post the good, bad and ugly! Price is still hanging around that resistance turned to support. Been in the trade since I think last Thursday. I'll just leave it - either to hit SL or move up. If it hit's SL it's only a small loss so that's fine. Reason for taking the trade was the break and retrace above the resistance back to support. Cheers

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi Pharley I have to be sincere I did read a few post but not all the thread it is going to take me a full day I believe. I like it nice and simple. Only one question if I may. When You say Weekly Support and resistance. Do You mean the SR of the current Week, last Week or a few weeks back till one finds the HL that could be even let'say 10/15 weeks just to say a number Appreciate your answer Thank You Ralfy

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi Ralfy, Not the SR of the current week, but swing highs and lows from the weekly chart - see attached EURCAD weekly chart showing some major SR areas as an example. Cheers

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi Pharley, your SL @ 137.50?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi Happy, yeah more or less - not ideal, but it's ok.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Curious, where are you thinking this will go? TP?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thanks Pharley been very quick to answer. I got it now I think Weekly chart and draw what You see as major SR then go to the daily one and see what reaction there is at those levels and enter a trade even at lower time frame as a 4 hour one if the right candle formation appears as a Pin Bar, inside bar, Engulfing etc. Hope I got it right.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Gdi, Got my TP just under 144 - but anything can happen!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Ralfy, Yep that sounds about right mate. Yes my trades are normally entered at the 4hr level after I see a good setup on the daily candle, which should be around major S/R levels based off the weekly. I must admit though, one of my very favourite set ups using this is with channels - I love trading those! Cheers

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Yea I agree anything can happen, thanks mate.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thanks. Thanks for the patient and relentless contribution in this thread.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Saw a good setup in GBPUSD - H4 with pin bar. Not sure it's a good setup.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi Happy, Thanks mate - well, if I start a thread about how I trade, I'd better be around to post on it and answer questions! I took a quick look at the GU - see chart below. It's currently in between a channel, and also near a resistance off the weekly. Things aren't moving too much on many charts at the moment, so it's one of those situation where I don't trade. I try and wait for clear signals - if you look at the chart, there's no set direction. Sure on the 4hr chart it may drop to channel support again, but at the moment I won't trade it until it does, or shows definite signs of moving up over resistance. Hope that helps Cheers

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi pharley Just picking your brains as to why your TP on EJ is around 144, seems a little way down from the 90%! Or do you see some resistance around there? Cheers

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hey Happy - just looking at the 4hr, if price can get above that resistance and stay above it, look for a retrace back to the same area (now it's support) and look for it moving upwards again for a good trade up to the major channel resistance.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Rover, Yes I've taken something way off to the left from the weekly - see pic of the weekly chart.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hey Happy - I was just going to say, the reason I'm preferring a long rather than a short on the GBPUSD at the moment, is that on the daily and weekly chart, you can see the price is in a rising channel, and I prefer not to go against a trend. CHeers

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Yep got it, ta mate. We're experiencing real August trading conditions currently with daily ranges taking a bit of a nose dive. Your thread's hot hot hot on FF's home page btw! Cheers

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Rover - an important point I was just thinking about is that we're all trying to learn how to trade and read the charts. A really important part of that is knowing when NOT to trade. There are many times I've traded in the past only to go on and regret it. It's a bit difficult to fully explain what to look for, but if I don't see an obvious set up, an obvious trend, channel - and you start seeing mainly sideways movement, it's just best not to trade anything. Far less risky - wait for the terrific set ups. Deciding not to trade is also a valid position you can take. It's why I mentioned a while ago about taking a screen shot of your perfect set ups - retracements, cracking pin bars at S/R, channels etc and keeping those to refer to. I constantly go back to my library of great set ups to reinforce what I'm looking for. I used to chase the market for trades, but having been burned, and burned, and again!, now I wait and wait some more. Hot on FF? Ah well, hopefully it's of use and we can all learn something. I'm learning all the time, and posting trades keeps me honest as well. Cheers

--- 帖子 #408 ---
'taking a screen shot of your perfect set ups - retracements, cracking pin bars at S/R, channels etc and keeping those to refer to' ​That's a good idea, I already keep a trading diary of trades entered and not entered together with my thoughts, adding a screen shot will enhance that. It's surprising how you forget a few months down the road why you took that particular trade. And as I'm ancient memory is not what it once was!!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I hear you mate! In the same boat. Have a look through some charts in the downtime and spot terrific set ups. Make a copy with some notes of them and keep them handy - these are the ones you want to trade. As well as those, take a few shots of charts that you don't want to trade - consolidations and sideways movements. Refer to those often as well. It's all part of training your eyes to see these things as they appear on charts. Cheers

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Thanks pharley for the advice. Will see how it goes.

Hi Pharley, Please review my setup.

Hello Phil, Thank you very much for your thread. I am primarily a day trader and doing well. Nevertheless, your thread inspired me to start a new sub account to try and learn your strategy. I realised that the beauty of your methodology is not the number of pips but the growth in the size of positions by keeping the initial risk factor constant (and decreasing) when a trade goes in the right direction. And it enables alpha returns to account equity :-) On a side note: I read that you are a UK National and OZ citizen.. so just wondering which team you support during Ashes series (of course, if you follow Cricket)! cheers, Johny

Pharley ok i can understand the support and resistance you draw and i learn it from the first article you linked to. What about supply and demand you also linked to an article about that, i read it some times but i dont understand it, can you please explain more about this and how you use it, or if someone else get it please explain ? Best regards and thanks.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
HI ffhung, That looks ok mate. Got the 50% retrace entry ok and it's moving down. Hope it works out - what's the risk reward like? Is that about 1:2? Cheers

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Ah, I have to go for the Aussies! If you can take something from this method and utilise it in how you trade, that's great! Cheers

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Scardi - I'm getting there! At the moment I sort of choose when I want to work (think add more to the trading pot), but it normally lines up with visa requirements and trips back to Australia to see my folks. Trading allows me to live with the wife and kids for extended periods, but when I have to sort visas out, I normally pick up a short contract. Plan is to get just a few more of these longer runs then just do trading full time - nearly there! Cheers

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi jgadefelth, When I'm looking at charts I'm aware of key supply and demand areas. If you're looking at weekly or daily charts, you will be too although you may not be aware of it. A run upwards in price which then weakens and then reverses is a supply area. We draw a resistance line, but it's really an area in which supply outstrips demand (sellers out number buyers), so the price drops. It's at those key areas that supply demand traders expect price to retrace from if it gets up there again. On my side, I'm aware of those areas, and look to draw my resistance line somewhere in that area, either as a horizontal resistance line or a line joining 2 or more tops, where I'm expecting price will bounce away from if it gets there again. That's how people trade with trend line trading (see Myronn's original thread http://forex-strategies-revealed.com...ading-strategy and there are quite a few thread on here that emulate this way of trading. They're all valid ways to trade of S/R and supply demand areas. Just keep things simple - complexity isn't required. Manage your risk, don't over leverage. Practise it and get better at spotting set ups. Cheers

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Update on eurjpy after price moved down before moving up again, I tightened my stop loss, which was eventually taken out. That's fine - although I'd rather get a win, a small loss of only 2.6% I happy to take. Important thing to note - never increase your stop so that you'll take more loss. If you're going to move it, tighten it up so you take a reduced loss. At the moment I'm not in any trades - nothing is attracting my eye on the charts, so I'm happy leaving it for now. I'll keep my eyes on things though and will be reading around the forex subject learning more about shorter term channel trading. Cheers

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I'm about to begin studying your thread. Thanks for your will to share! Kindly point me to risk regard. This ratio should be? Cheers

Hello all New to forex trading and keen to learn. Thanks Pharley for explaining S &amp; R so well.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi ffhung, In terms of risk, that's something that only you can answer. You have to work out what you are happy risking to lose. Everyone is different. That could be a % of your account or a $ risk of your account. If you use one of the online position size calculators, you can enter the size of your stop loss, how much risk you want to take, what you're trading and it will calculate the lot size you should use base on your risk %. Cheers

Hi Terminator12 In my humble opinion the right entry was around 138.30 few bars ago. I am still bullish in this pair and I would not take any short trade yet. Only if I see a great set up, and this one was not.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi Pharley, How do you feel about the GBPJPY? Waiting for a PA on the daily. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Relax I see now what u mean now Still bullish Thanks

Hi Pharley, I have tried analysis on Usd Cad and would like your opinion. The top horizontal red line is weekly support, the break of trend line red also happened and we have one fully formed pin bar and looking like forming another today for a short? The bottom solid red line is support and the green line is support using trend line, which should I use for take profit. Thanks Alam

Hi all! My apologies for my previous charts. I should have removed the indicator from them. I have tried to strip out my charts while looking at this potential setup. What do you guys think about this potential EURCAD trade? Have I drawn the fibonnaci lines correctly? I have not taken a position yet but keeping an eye on it! Best,

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hi T12, I'd just wait until it comes down a bit - on the daily that bottom channel part is the lower part of a big wedge. I'd wait and see what happens - the wedge is getting smaller and smaller!

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Dutch, That rising bottom line in the 4hr tells me to wait, perhaps pressure is building on the upside for it to break through. Could have traded the price up and down, but I prefer to wait until it starts a direction again.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi there, On the weekly we've had 2 tries at pushing price down only for it to come back up again. On the monthly chart the trend has been up for about 4 years, so with those 2 things I'm not going short and just waiting. Price is at an important level - see the monthly chart and you'll see it easily. At the moment price might drop 100 pips or so, but I'm waiting for a clearer signal to either continue the move upwards, or a definite signal tat it's going down. For the downside (for me) it would have to get below 1.28. Cheers

--- 帖子 #436 ---
HI there, The eurjpy looks interesting. Just watch the TP as it's below the rising channel - that's one of the problem in taking trades against the trend. You generally end up with a smaller risk:reward as you've got to make sure price hits the target. But I can see where you got in at 50% retrace etc, so looking good! Now just try and get these entries in line with the trend. Don't worry if it seems ages away - wait for it as the pay off is big. If you do want to enter against trend (not recommended) or even on a smaller time frame, you could do the following - see the attached chart which is 15m (very short time for me!). But even on the smaller timeframe you can see breaks and retraces happening. For the shorter timeframes just stick to a risk reward of 1:2 or 1:3 (better). Just make sure you draw in the major S/R areas first, then you can see if you have room to get 1:3. These 15m or even 1hr trades occur all over the place - look for them. It's sometimes nice to play those while waiting for a big run to be set up. Cheers

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I know this is getting away a bit from the thread and how I trade the long term S/R areas, but I just had a quick look through the GBPJPY bouncing off a rising channel to spot potential 15m break and retrace entries. 4hr chart below shows where it is so you can see. The 15m chart below it shows quite a few potential entries. The problem with is is managing your risk - if you do these, go for 1% risk or something small. Move up SL as we do already to a new SL are to capture profits. We're still expecting it to go to the top channel line, so just ride it up. Cheers

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi Tibovwh, Yes I think there's no need to look at the resistance from early 2014 - it's moved down quite a bit from that peak and now we're more concerned with the moves at end 2014 and start of 2015. In fact with this one I'm focussed on the channel it's in and waiting for it to drop to the lower side before looking to enter long. Cheers

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Regarding breaks and retraces - if you did nothing else but just played these, you'd be doing very well - here's another couple of examples on the 4hr charts. NOte that your SL would be minimal and risk rewards would be terrific. These appear many time on hour or 4 hourly charts as well as the 15m if you don't want to wait longer. Just learn as master one way to trade - look for your setups on charts all the time until your eye gets used to spotting them as they happen. S/R is terrific for all this stuff.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
This could be interesting with a pin for yesterday - probably wait until it gets to that 4hr resistance line though:

INteresting mate - what's the set up you entered short?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Oh the AUDCAD one is really busy mate - here is my chart for that one. To be honest I'm not really a fan of CAD crosses - it tends to jump around a bit so I don't trade that one often.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
It's at 50% retrace of second day. Not safe?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Ah I see, I don't enter at a 50% retrace of a day. I enter at 50% retrace of a move. If you look at some of the earlier posts where I have 50% retracements, you'll see it's based on price movement however long that is, not just the daily candle. Cheers

--- 帖子 #448 ---
A couple of quick examples, long and short. Enter at the 50% mark:

--- 帖子 #449 ---
And remember, here is the Soros trade taken off 50% retracement on the 1hr chart (I posted it way back), then he added to position when price moved down again. If the big players are doing this, then so am I !!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Thank you, Pharly.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi Pharley, Would a pin here on the daily of the AUDJPY also be a valid entry although the pin is not directly on the S&amp;R line?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi Dutch, It could be mate - It's certainly in that demand zone or resistance area. Definitely one to keep an eye on.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
In fact, I might go long there myself.

Pharley more? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thank you for your reply Pharley, So you are always interested in "fresh" zones on the Weekly chart? I've read quite a bit of different things on this matter. Sometimes people argue that markets have a long memory and the longer it goes back to more important the zone. I always try to look at Weekly zones that have been tested often. Could you talk about your view on this? In addition, I'm still unsure how to spot valid signals... Do you take signals ON the zones? If so, what exactly do you look for? Simple pinbars or do you look at other candlestick patterns too? Or do you wait untill it has made a first move and then enter on the 50% retrace? I've been looking at CHF/JPY reaction to trendline and it looks like this atm. It went in a very small range for a week. It diden't quite reach my support zone but this pair has been moving up strongly for years. How do you see this chart ? Best,

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Great! Did you already found an entry on the AUDJPY?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi Dutch, No I didn't enter that one - I was busy watching the price and wasn't convinced of an entry. It's got to be a terrific, obvious set ups for me to enter. Cheers

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Thanks for starting this threath Pharley, very good way to watch the market ... Have a day job, and this migth be relaxed way to get a few pips from the market. Like you simple but effective way to trade with clean charts...

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi Tibovwh, Yes it's true that forex does have a long memory and we look to the left of the chart at historical data to get a feeling of S/R areas on the long timeframe. In this case price had moved a long way from the early 2014 data and in fact had another swing upwards nearly 12 months later, which is much closer to current price, so I take the closer one. If it hadn't had another big move inbetween, then I'd be looking at the earlier data. Now a difficult bit to get your head around, which is what I look for. And I suspect this is the main reason new traders find it all too hard and go back to indicators or lose and give up. There isn't just 1 thing I look for when I'm looking for entries. I look at everything, but there are some key things I look out for. One thing is momentum - how fast is the price moving towards a S/R area? Does it move fast and and does it slow down as it approaches. Are there doji's appearing, are there other candles with long downwards pointing wicks (when looking for a long at support),are there key candles appearing such as pins, engulfing, is there a head and shoulder pattern present, flag patterns. And where is all this happening n the market structure? In short, I look at everything. And that's the hard bit - it's not as simple as black and white. Perhaps that's why people use indicators because it's a yes or a no with those. But they're all lagging so I don't use them. Nothing is guaranteed, but you can put the odds in your favour by looking at what's happening on the charts. As an analogy - does getting a University degree guarantee you a job? Certainly not, but it probably bumps up your chances of one. That applies to trades as well. When I'm working I primarily do master project scheduling using primavera 6 and MS Project. If I do a training course on those tools, does it guarantee me a job? No, but I might get an interview because I have some knowledge (apparently!) of the tools of the trade. If I have many years experience in actually doing the work using the tools and proved that I can do it, does it guarantee a job. No, but I'm likely to be further ahead in the game than someone who knows how to use the tools, but has minimal experience. Throughout the years of experience, I've come across lots of different types of projects in different industries in different countries. Not much surprises me any more and I know the tools inside out. Trading is exactly the same. Exactly. Learn MT4, MT5 - whatever the platform is. That's the easier bit. The harder bit is the experience, and I (or anyone else) can't teach that. I can show examples, try and describe what I look for, but to try and condense years of looking at charts in to a few sentences is truly difficult. All I know is that there are 2 key elements that put the odds in your favour as described above. That's price action and risk mgt. The reason is price action works in any market conditions and has proved itself to work over years and years. Risk mgt keeps you in the game and keeps your money safe. OK got to go - enough of my ramblings!

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Pharley, I appreciate your answer very much. And I understand what you are saying. There is never a black or white situation. I know I need lots more screen time before I will be a good trader but I'm willing to put in the work! So as far as the EURCAD trade goes, Is it the level indicated in the first chart you are looking at? In addition, an update on my earlier posted CHFJPY trade that I had been stalking. It has moved as I expected and I will now look for retracement entry Best,

--- 帖子 #461 ---

First TP option will be 140.00 area. or main R 150.00. If price manage to break 140 and make a daily close above, price might try higher Supply zones. Idealy I will buy more lots if pprice continue up. News can be a pain, so make some room and keep Sl as big as possible. At the moment bullish trades still valid

--- 帖子 #466 ---
EUGBP I think is a tricky one, it likes to make long retracement . I am still bearish on thi one. For a long trade better to wait for a strong pull back to a confluence demand area combined with some bullish pattern. my two cents.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Thanks relaxtrading, I've got a resistance on 140.00 too(will add positions if it breaks and move SL), then a weaker resistance on 144.80(probably just add another position whether it breaks or not) and then my last resistance and final target will be the 149.30 area. But yeah a lot of news tomorrow. Glad I'm starting to make the right calls on my own with the help of this thread. I'm also short on the AUDCHF, entered at 0.7170, 100pips up so far, ultimate target will be around 0.6940 area(not a lot of support stopping it).

--- 帖子 #468 ---
AUDCHF bearish Target1 0.70 T2 0.6885. This is not my favorite pair. I am not trading exotic pairs due to the way that they behave, very unreliable. With 100 pips positive I probably move Sl to BE. I don't see much room for a second lot if you planing to get out around 0.70

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Fortunatly, I am short What would you consider a good S/L to play a rejection of this trendline? Best,

--- 帖子 #470 ---
If I understand your question correctly, Stop loss for a short trade at least 0.7180, however now is attemping for second time so probably I would rather to be out BE or better, depend on your entry.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hi all, Sorry I've been a bit busy with some others things and also trading another method that I have while the charts were quieter. It's only what I consider scalping on 15m timeframes using S/R on the low timeframes. Always interesting to get pips while I'm waiting for clear, larger runs. Cheers

Decided to get out at 0.6980 with the actual target being 0.6940 area, about 190pips made so I'm happy. I usually don't trade any CHF pairs but were extremely positive about this trade. Think I'm sitting out for today as there is quite a lot of news releases.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
My opinion is you should move your stoploss up by at least 100pips and when market breaks the 1.1000 level move SL to current one and i think you are in the clear for at least another move of 100pips down. If the 1.090 level breaks then it could easily go to 1.0700 and potentially 1.06000.

Anybody looking for a trade AUDUSD? Several pins on daily!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Long on ACHF and AJ

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Audus is between 0.745 and 0.725 ups and down, there is not much to do in my opinio. Main trend still Short, until this range is broken stay aside, or entry on S1 or R1.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Yes, I think you are right Relax! It looks like a flag - bullish sign? Waiting for a big move up and enter on the 50% retr. It has to be the perfect setup!

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Idkurv, I have the AUDJPY ready, waiting for PA long on the daily! Thanks! I did not saw the possibility on the AUDCHF! Also waiting for daily PA!

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi Pharley! Need to come back some really good entries comming up! GBPJPY, AUDCHF, AUDJPY, EURUSD etc. Question! I took a trade on the GBPJPY and till now failed to take a 2nd trade because there was not enough retracement. At the moment could be a entry point but price is at a daily resistance point. My choice would be wait till it breaks this point and buy on the retracement. What do you think! I have the SL on the entry price! To early?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi guys, Looks though there are some good trades there and well in profit. Look for those retraces to enter again - just logical place to move SL to and further entry. Now I'll just post a bit of what I've been doing on the shorter timeframes. I'm tired so I'll keep this short plus I don't want to change the thread away from the longer term chart trading, but this is one of the ways I trade shorter term charts. It's still based off PA and SR areas. I primarily use the longer term and this shorter term method together - I normally do the shorter term if I can't see much on the larger time frame charts and it's usually pretty successful. This last load of trades I did went very well. Tomorrow (Sunday) I'll go back to looking at the longer term charts for set ups. For the short term trading, I use 4hr charts for main SR, then go to 15m charts for minor SR and PA. The first picture looks a bit confusing, but I'll explain. I was trading the euraud which was trading up in a channel, then went back down, Then it went up again and finished above the previous swing high. I measure the last run down with my measuring fib and took the 90% level. Then I ran a line from that 90% point at the same angle as the channel to give me a 90% target level all the way up. The second chart shows 15m entries taken off minor SR break then retrace, and other entries off PA. SL were managed the same way as the larger timeframes - if and when I can, I move SL up to at least BE or better so trades are safe. I've put notes on the pics so you can see. It's just another way of trading SR and PA. Cheers

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Just looking through that 15m chart over a couple of days, there are lots of PA entries that could be taken. I've noted some of them on a chart and post it below - not all, but quite a few. These are the types of things I'm looking for on (in particular) shorter term charts. Ones I particularly like are breaks of a minor retracing resistance line (when the overall trend is up), when price comes back to a rising trend line and thirdly when price breaks through and retraces. If you have a quick look at these, see how much risk reward is possible as you can easily spot where you could put a minimal SL. Have a look at eurusd or any chart and look for one that's in a trend up or down, and have a go at identifying entries not just off a 4hr chart, but also a 1hr or 15m chart. As well as multiple entries on a 4hr chart playing major SR, this is how I try to maximise my trading. Hope it's of use. Cheers

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Someone sent me an email asking how I use the fib. I explained at the start, I use the fib for 2 purposes. First is to identify a target point for my exits. This is at 90% of a previous run from support to resistance or the other way. Below is a pic of eurusd of recent PA where I've identified major SR areas with yellow solid lines, then drawn the fib with 10 equal spaces across the last run up from S to R. Then I can easily see where 90% of the run is - shown at the red line. So the next time I'm going long off support, I'm targeting the 90% red line for TP for all my trades. (Trades are taken off the 4hr chart). Cheers

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Same eurusd chart,now with 4hr entries. This is how I use the fib to measure 50% entries. I've shown 2 on there, but if you look, you will see many more, and a logical place to raise your SL to after a further entry.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Someone also asked me why I don't just trade the 15m stuff. The answer is I just don't have time to trade like that all the time, and I also don't want to be stuck in front of the charts day after day. What I came up with for me - i.e. it suits how I like to trade, is 1) a long term method which allows me time away from the charts, spend time with the kids etc, and 2) a short term method for the times when I can be in front of the charts. It's really a good idea to have at least a couple of different ways to trade based on long and short time frames. Both methods are based off tried and tested PA - nothing complex, just as simple as I can make them and hopefully logical. Cheers

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Thanks ,

Thanks pharley mate for posting this, really appreciate it

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi all, Took 3 x 1 lot trades this morning on EURAUD - didn't have quite enough time to take all the pics I wanted, but 1) trade 1 entry shown on first pic ( I hadn't set TP at that point so it's not shown). Entry taken off retrace on 15m chart. 2) trade 1, 2 and 3 in play with TP shown; 3) all trades exit at TP. TP was placed before major SR - even if I'm entering on lower time frames, I try to use the major SR areas as targets. A quick $2100 in not a very long time, for minimal risk. When second order triggered, first trade SL was moved to BE. When third order triggered, SL for trade 2 was moved to BE and SL for trade 1 moved to the same location, locking in profits. Chugging along at a very healthy win rate of 72.5%. Cheers

Absolute carnage in the markets today, maybe a good week to take time out of trading!!

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Oh my goodness. I was trading euraud long all today and it's gone up 750 pips as I speak. I hope everyone got a good load of pips on many pairs. Good grief, I made a shed load today! A terrific day!

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Totally agree.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
You kindly shared the system, I am really pleased for you well done.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
As you said pharley there's always an element of luck in trading and today was one of those days

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi Pharley, Congratulations with your big hit! Your helpfullness has been rewarded!! I had good luck on the GBPAUD that hit TP with 2 entries with the spike up. I am still papertrading on a demoaccount! All the currencies had a big huge move!

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi Idkurv, I did not take those trades because I could not find a good PA moment! I think the cause is China!

--- 帖子 #507 ---
well done Pharley

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hi all, yes some interesting runs - almost no time to look at proper PA set ups as price moved so fast. At least with some decent PA analysis already done on the charts, it puts you in a good position to take advantage of any fast moving runs. Did anyone else score some big runs from the recent moves?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hello Pharley Been following this thread since it started and let me says you are sharing some really great trading insights here. Really thank you much for that. I really like support and resistance along with volume analysis coupled with playing strength/weakness currency. Did make some nice pips since last night on EUR/CAD about 300 pips as I played this pair long since last night a few times. Cant complain Getting a good method down along with only playing with the overall trend is key to me. One just need to get with the flow of the market. Order flow is always a good thing InnerGrowth

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi Pharley, sometime the fibo can draw from both buy and sell angle, both ways seem logical. How you decide which way to go?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Happy - normally the direction is taken off whichever the price is bouncing off. Meaning if price had gone up to a good resistance level, then come down to support, I'm expecting price to travel upwards again. Great on horizontal levels and terrific on channel trading. Cheers

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi InnerG, Great you made some good pips last night! Welcome! Cheers

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi Pharley, Thanks for this great great thread. I am a 2 month old newbie in forex and have been following this thread for quite sometime. I made +1300pips yesterday on GBPAUD long. This has become possible because of your method of adding positions on retraces and S/Ls in a logical way. Please continue posting your ideas so that people like me could learn more and hold on to forex without wiping out our accounts. Thanks

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Temptation got the better of me this morning, went long on the USDJPY and GPBJPY. After both went +-30pips positive I decided to not be greedy and closed both positions and just stay out of the market. Now I really regret it as they are both looking like good trades to be in. It does seem like the market is quite stable again, just think any small rumour could spark another sell-off. Rather safe than sorry I guess.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Can EURJPY Find support? Or are we going lower from here? What's your take? Best,

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hi there, I like the look of that rising support line you have and it seems to be in a bit of a channel there. I'll watch it as well - could bounce away from support up to the top of the channel again. Here's hoping it does and there are quite a few pips to be gained. Cheers

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi Mobber, Yeah markets are a bit funny at the moment. Went from not much movement to explosive! All I can suggest is to take the best set ups you can. This is where a picture library of your favourite set ups comes in handy. I use mine - I refer to them often and cast my eye over the setups I want to see. It's not good to just trade for trading sake - there has to be a reason on the chart. That way, you're putting odds further in your favour. All traders around the world see exactly the same charts and price action as you, me, everyone. So that's a good reason to take the obvious setups - everyone can see it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Yamini, That's awesome! Terrific result! There's always an element of luck on those type of fast moving runs whether it's we were trading a particular pair at the time, managed to spot a good run, nothing stopped price moving in the right direction and no bad news. But at least with this type of PA we can be looking at the charts in the right way and be prepared. I made a lot on Monday and was lucky too but at least I had already drawn in major S/R areas, and price on euraud that I was trading, went straight to it. So it's always good value to study some charts over the weekend and drw/redraw major S/R areas for your week of trading ahead. Anyway, good results mate - keep your risk mgt under control and keep looking for good PA setups. Cheers

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Interesting GBP USD on the 30Min? Best,

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Looks interesting if it takes off northwards. 300 to 400 pips potential run - let's hope!:

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Isn't it quite possible that it goes south? That would also be a huge run.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi Banksia, Yes for sure it could go either way - especially with the markets being like they are! Anyway, I've entered 1 trade and placed several pending orders - you can see on the chart below. The actual entry points for further trades are dependant on price action - these are just there so I'm ready to go with them. First trade is only 0.5 lots, so minimal risk for a nice big overall gain. If it turns south an breaks below, I'll re do my trades for shorts. Cheers

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi - I've moved up SL on T1 to entry point so this is no longer at risk.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hello Pharley Good job on this EUR/AUD trade. Did also got a trade long on this pair and closed it for 20 pips profit. Still need to learn on my confidence to keep those trade longer hehe. Really love your thread and really thank you for the time you take to share your great knowledge. May the divine bless you with immense wealth and happiness as you definitely deserve it. InnerGrowth

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi Pharley, You are moving your SL to entry point pretty fast. This is something I am struggling with in my own trades especially the ones you put in later on the road. The market could easily have a pull back and especially on the entrance market could retest the resistance. Can you have a look at my example of the EURUSD. Would you set SL1 lower? Can you please comment the SL management in this trade? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Dutch, Looking good mate. If you have a look at the first pic below you can see where I've got a SR line - it have previously been resistance, then broke through then eventually came back and acted as support. I'd be putting my stops just above that area - but I don't think you're is far away from it and is based on that last swing high so that's fine. Second pic - In terms of moving my stops up - it all comes down to if I have time to be in front of the charts. Today I was able to watch for quite a bit, but then had to leave them. I moved up my SL to a point just below an hour candle that had first touched the falling resistance line as I knew I couldn't be in front of them. Anyway, price came down and took them out. But that's ok as I had locked in some T1 profits and T2 was at BE. T3 lost some but all together a small loss - almost a break even set of trades, so I'm ok with that. On to the next one!

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi, Well as I changed to a new broker in July, I thought I'd create a MyFXBook thing. If nothing else, it will keep me honest! I've already gone through the analysis and can see where there are weak spots in my trading, so that's good news. Just the last few trades have been a bit slack and I probably shouldn't have taken them. Never mind, I'm always learning - you never stop. There's not much on there at the moment as it only runs from when I started with this new broker, but I'll be able to keep track of how I'm going. For those who are interested you can see performance (or not!) here: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Phar...y-live/1351199

--- 帖子 #531 ---
One of the things I am pleased to see on the analysis side of things is that the Risk of Ruin is very low for busting out the account. Currently only a 0.19% risk of losing 50% and less than 0.01% of losing everything. The others at a 4% chance of losing 30% I can live with, but I'll work on bringing down the 38% chance of losing 10% - I'd like that lower.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Are you Kidding ?, of course everyone is interested!! Nice work, I was proud of myself at 10 - 15 % a month till i saw that, shows you though what trades you were knocking it out of the park on. Im surprised no one mentioned the usd/chf trade though earlier this week, i got 500 pips out of it, would post a screenshot but need to learn how.....

--- 帖子 #533 ---
is it possible to use your method sir for usoil and gold?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi Prsj, Mate, 10 to 15% a month is terrific! If you can keep that going you'll be set for the future. When you're in a run, do you enter multiple times or just take the one trade? You'll see from how I trade I take a few losses that are small in comparisons to the large runs. That's because I've entered once and perhaps twice, then it could turn against me. But when it runs in my favour, I enter more times to really get some big gains. I suppose I expect my profits/graph drop down in small increments, then have a spike up on a large run which is what you can on myFXbook. I'm going to try and spend some time weeding out the bad trades. But how I manage risk is key - if I'm risking about 2.5% on first trades, then about 4 losses equates to around a 10% drop in equity which I'm ok with as the gains on a run are huge in comparison. Anyway keep it up with the gains! Terrific!

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hi Jebataro, Yes I think it would, as it's just based on what price is doing around support, resistance. A quick look at the gold chart shows all the same type of movements to and fro S/R areas. Same goes for crude oil as well. A quick look at that chart shows the potential to go from current price (around $45) to $55 or perhaps even $60 as it's just bounced off support. Good luck Cheers

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Would you be so kind as to make the trade history viewable? It would help people to learn/understand what you are doing. With all my best, MK

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Oh I think I'm happy at the moment to share what I have. How I do things is on this thread. This week I'm primarily looking at: euraud gbpaud gbpcad gbpjy gbpnzd gbpusd usdjpy Have a look at some daily charts and you can see where major S/R are and where price is in relation to it.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Let's see if euraud can bounce up from the channel - good potential for around 500 pips if it can get through the minor downwards trendline.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
ok, now price has moved up to near the downwards trend line - I'm up around 50 pips so far, and it has retraced then moved back up. So now I've moved SL up to entry plus a few pips. Now I wait to see what happens at the trend line. I'm ready for either price heading down - trade is safe with zero risk - or moving through and upwards. If it does that I'll look for a retrace entry back at the line.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I've a pending long order placed if it moves higher, plus I'll also wait for a pullback to the trend line.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
This is enormously helpful Pharley to see how you manage your trades. Thanks so much for sharing!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
OK no problem I understand. Pretty pointless to post your myfxboox link then as there is nothing to learn from it while the real content private. I guess you just wanted to pat your ego some, no problem. That is what trading forums are for.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Gee, I post how I trade on here - nothing else to learn from the fx book. If you don't find it helpful, don't read.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Lol Mid Your comments is too offensive. Pharley is kind enough to share his awesome trading with us. Be content with it or move away lol. Some people are really tough to satisfy lol. Your doing great Pharley. InnerGrowth

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Thanks IG and Banksia - yeah, trying to show how I trade. I can understand though - some people want to see the $. But I've been trying to avoid showing $ gained. I think people focus too much on it - I know I did at first! The important thing is to learn the how - the dollars come later depending on trading pot, risk and lot size. Cheers

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hello Pharley You are exactly right. The amount of $ earned is not what is important but having a consistent profitable strategy is InnerGrowth

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I did not ask for the dollars at all. I don't care about that in the slightest. And Innergrowth, when you grow up one day, you will learn to speak when you are being spoken to.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
The second trade by the way, was taken off a 50% retracement back to the trend line. Price is still hanging around there so we'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
ok, Midnight - I can see you get riled up pretty quick. Is that because you don't know how to trade? Bad results? What ever it is please take a calm pill. I'm just trying to show how I trade, how to maximise growth in a single run of pips. If you can't/don't want to learn something because you already know everything, please feel free to post how you trade as well on your own thread. I'm always happy to learn from someone with experience and knowledge.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
I got out early - I didn't like the look of the current price action so took some profit. If things change I'll enter again. Cheers

--- 帖子 #551 ---
pharley, Mid really did not ask for $ but for trade history. I would love that too. Why? because I can draw your entries on my charts and learn from there. Your screenshots do show how you trade, but often without context that I am used to see, etc. So I don't find Mid's request that unreasonable.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
pharley I want to thank you for posting your 'MyFXBook thing' as it is, in fact all your postings, you've no idea how you've helped me! Please just carry on as you are. I think it may be a quiet day today, certainly this morning, as it's a Bank Holiday here in the UK. So we may have to rely on the US this afternoon

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi Rover mate, Thanks for that. Hey it's good it's helping you! Have you got many pips recently? I don't mind showing the fxbook thing, but I don't really want to give out everything - I want people to have a think for themselves and not just copy trades (although I know it's a retrospective list of trades). Copying trades (I know there are automated ones around) is ok, but what if the person disappears? It's far better to know how to get pips yourself (same as the old saying about teaching someone to fish rather than give them fish!). Keep at it mate. I'm still waiting for the next bigger run - hopefully it wont be too long. I missed some of the shorts recently which is a bit annoying but there's always more trades. Cheers

--- 帖子 #554 ---
i have a question. Where is a logical SL. When trailing a SL? I follow your rule but always got stop out before market run, small loss but miss a huge gain Anyway, your system is good. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi Love and thanks for your question. Can you post a chart showing your entries and where you've been stopped out? Then it's easier for me to see what's happening. Don't worry I've been stopped out recently a few times - price just gets going, then halts and returns! A bit frustrating! During times like that I'm always managing the risk side of things in case price does come back. When price does start to trend though, that's where big gains can be made. Cheers

--- 帖子 #556 ---
GU from july 9 to august 25. There is alot of ranging, how to avoid that and catch the next big run?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi Love, If you're trading GU then you can't avoid it. The only way is not to trade a pair when it's not trending. Take a look at the following during the same time:- AUDJPY AUDNZD EURAUD NZDJPY and there are probably a fair few more that were moving. The trick is to recognise that a pair isn't trending - if you can't see it clearly moving upwards or downwards, then it's probably just ranging. When ranging I either leave well alone, or take a different way of trading. My preference is to leave it alone though and look for another pair. I'm looking for pairs that move from the S/R and away to another S/R area. You can do this on just about any time frame, but I prefer the longer ones as I can't be in front of the charts all the time. Even on a 15m chart you can find the same sort of price action. Look at this horrible chart (sorry for the lines) on a 15m euraud, and see all the potential moves up and down - lots of action. But anyway, try to get your eye in in spotting when things aren't trending - take the longer timeframe of 4hr, daily, weekly for that. If something is trending well on the daily, take entries on the 4hr or even 1hr (or even 15m!!!!) in the same direction when there are pull backs to S/R areas, 50% retracements, off channel S/R areas.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Oh i forgot to tell where i put my SL. If market up i move to a lowest of yesterday candle, market down i move SL to highest yesterday candle

--- 帖子 #559 ---
and don't forget some correlation - I think most pairs that were USD/something or something/USD weren't moving much back then. But others were, so if you find yourself being mired down with a pair, always look around. Try and have half a dozen pairs as your go to set for trading.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi Pharley, Markets are moving, did you pick a trade this morning (evening for you)? I am into EURUSD and GBPUSD! Also EURAUD because of bouncing off the trendline and currency strength

Also went long on the EURUSD, GBPUSD I am still waiting for the to go up a bit for confirmation. EURAUD looks good but I missed that one.

Hi Mobber and Dutch - hope you get some great pips. I'm having some pain in the backside problems with my wifi. I managed to trade a bit today and got some, but at the moment it's terrible for me to connect without it dropping out every 2 mins it seems!

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi Mobber, The trades where not lucky shots. EURUSD and EURAUD closed at BE and SL on the GBPUSD. Lessons: I did not look at the news and there was economic news for GBP at 10:30 and I opened the second trade for the EURAUD at a point of resistance. So I closed the two trades at BE. Next time better,

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I'm on my 3rd entry on EUR/AUD - initially entered @ 1.57150, on about 410 pips for the 3, have moved 2 of the trades SL into positive positions. Really want to close out the first one which is at 240 pips but going to hang in there as I feel there is further to go.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hi Dutchpips; Look for Market Momentum and lack of it as the Market approaches significant Levels. I hope the charts below help.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hey Dutch, I am still in the EURUSD trade but things are looking very slow. If price breaks above 1.1365 it should take-off, I'm going to stick it out tomorrow and if it doesn't break the level I'll close the trade tomorrow after the US session. The market is really not volatile at the moment so hopefully things will look better next week. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Looking EURAUD it seems to be making a nice move up now. This week is filled with news events, tomorrow probably the last day to enter any kind of trade as it's NFP friday and it will be a volatile one.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi all, Hope some people made some good pips! I had internet probs last night, then most moves for me happened overnight while I was in the land of nod. Interesting - I just looked at myfxbook thing - it shows my account as -99.75%. I've sent them an email as I know that's not correct. Should be around +215% as I gained some yesterday. Perhaps it's to do with the fact that I use cTrader and not Mt4. Not sure, but rest assured, I've not blown the account! Cheers

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi Mobber; We see things in a slightly different way.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hey steve I totally agree with you, my initial target on the EURUSD was 1.158. I missed the bigger picture. Going to close the trade now for +-20pips profit. Thanks for the charts. Need to clean up my charts so I can post them along with my trades to show the picture I'm seeing.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Agree on all those Steve. But to risk going long, I would rather wait for some "completed retracement"...and having all those stops being wiped out of the way...and the Big Boys fat with their liquidity. There´s some exhaustion on the long side in my opinion..

If your nearing a trend channel line once your in a trade, would you exit all positions or keep moving stops along to see if you reach the 90% mark between weekly S/R

You're right it has. Looks like it may have broken below that trend though and it can't go up forever can it? What goes up must come down!

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Yeah it has broken below all my longterm trendlines, I would go for a sell if it breaks below the 121.70. It's stalling a bit now, but if it breaks I think trend can be confirmed as broken and reversed in the short term. Would be looking at the 120.00 level for some support again and then below that to the 116.00 level.

You could have a point! Thanks for sharing your view.

Hi all, Yes indeed I've had some bad internet problems! The damn thing keeps dropping out - done it twice just trying to log on now. Last few days haven't been good - probably because I'm trying to place trades in a hurry before I lose net access. Even then I can't manage them properly as I can't get back in. Frustrating in the extreme!!! I just have to try and remain calm (that's difficult when I want to throw stuff through the window!), focus again, try and bring the charts up on the longer timeframes and do some more analysis of what's happening. Hope you're all having better luck! Cheers

Interesting how Pharley disables myfxbook whenever it does not show profits...

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Oh well, here we go. 1. Previously I had a problem with myfxbook showing a loss greater than the actual equity in the account - I disabled it and packed in the account. I received an email from myfxbook saying that they had a problem with cTrader accounts and it should now be ok; 2. I reactivated it but I've decided to use it as an analysis tool for my trading rather than (as some have said) an ego booster, so I thought I put the setting on private, but obviously hadn't - so then I did; 3. I've also had previous comments about how good my hindsight trading is. So I posted live trade showing how to get some big gains and have tried to explain how I do that. If that's of use to some people that's terrific; 4. I'm not trying to sell anything, but provide some (hopefully) helpful information; 5. Yes I have losses - everyone does - ever seen a method that doesn't? But on a good run the gains far outweigh the losses and it's the long term goals we're after; 6. Having said that, I know there will be people who will knock any method, any post online. But I'm still up around 140% mark since mid July which I'm really happy with. 7. It's easy to criticise, much harder to do something positive yourself. At least I've posted what I do and shown it live. You should be braver and have a go yourself.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
I found your method interesting, so I wanted to see how you can do it in the long run. That's why I was monitoring your myfxbook. Posting a few live trades is all well and good, but can mean nothing in the long run, the market changes all the time. I am also monitoring this thread for new posts from you, but they are not here. I am not criticising your method, just your way of sharing data. You did come here to share did you not? You say yourself that this is not an ego boost. Well then share, share your wins and also losses.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Pharley is under no obligation to share anything. If you find the method interesting, then roll up your sleeves and do your own testing. No number of posted wins and losses will guarantee that you are able to succeed with this method. That's something only you can do. And thanks Pharley, for what you have contributed. I'm glad to see that you are having continued success.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Where did I have ever said he is obligated to? And that's just it, I *don't* see the continued success! The last thing I saw was a steady decline, before myfxbook got disabled. I do think that S/R or S/D methods are in principle working stable methods, I was interested in the details that pharley uses (fibo H4 swings etc.)

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Your statement that Pharley should "share his wins and also losses" implies that he is obligated to do something, which he clearly is not. And why this burning need to see proof of Pharley's results? If you think the method could work for you, then do some testing to find out. And quit being such a troll!

--- 帖子 #589 ---
"Do some testing of a method that does not produce gains even for its creator" wow, such logic. And stop being such a white knight

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Will you please leave our teacher alone.......If you don't like this thread just leave and find something else!! Pharley has been of great contribution for me and my trading.........

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi Pharley, I would not even react to this Plague. You will always have people like this, don't give them any attention. We love this threat and I have learned so much of it... I thought it is time to show my teacher the result I have made with his tradesystem the first month: Total of 2977 pips in 1 month. 6 winners and 7 losers 10-8 EURAUD 496 pips 2 entry 12-8 EURJPY -100 pips 13-8 CADJPY -100 pips 21-8 GBPJPY +550 pips 2 entry 24-8 GBPAUD +1270 pips 2 entry 24-8 GBPJPY -90 pips 25-8 GBPAUD -90 pips 26-8 EURUSD +430 pips 6 entry 27-8 EURAUD -67 pips 1-9 GBPUSD -100 1-9 EURAUD -83 pips 2-9 AUDJPY 44 pips 7-9 EURAUD +800 pips 5 entry See attached the last result

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hi Stevepatt, thanks for your explanations, I really like them! Momentum (Divergence) on the Weekly EURAUD and Support area on the 4hr decide for me to step into the trade and brought me 800 pips. I wanted to stay longer in the trade but due to work I had to take the profit early.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Impressive with the result. Thanks for sharing, mate. How many pairs you look at normally?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Happytrade, I am not looking at all the 28 pairs. I am still in the process to decide which pairs to trade. It is too much time consuming for me to check all the 28 pairs. I am still learning to check the charts on the different timeframes (weekly, daily, 4hr, 1hr and 15min) to find a oppertunity to step in, watching for main resistance levels, support demand in combination with divergence, channels and ofcourse PA too pull the trigger. I think it is about training to learn to recognize these things and I think to start with just a few pairs would be the best. After all you only need a few good trades per month I also want to trade the S&amp;P 500. My main focus at this moment is try to be consistent with only a few pairs. Dutch

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Thanks dchristi for the comment, You're right as well - any half decent method from anyone won't guarantee success for an individual. That's because much of trading comes down to yourself. How many times do we read that the biggest blocker to success in this game is yourself? Have to find a method that works for you and master it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Oh, a +140% in less than 2 months isn't successful ?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hey Dutch - awesome results! That's really terrific! Keep it going and build that account. Imagine the returns when trading 1 standard lot. Yes I suppose you're right in not replying to Plague. I was speaking with Lance Beggs (of YourTradingCoach) the other week. He said to me ages ago I should do a website or blog, but recently warned me that trolls and nay-sayers would be there no matter how well or bad I did. Guess he was right! Anyway, really pleased that's going so well for you mate - Doesn't matter if you're adding to it in terms of what you're looking for (divergence etc), as long as it works for you. My advice to anyone is to take a method of trading that is based on sound S/R or S/D principles and make it your own, master it, trade it. Because using S/R or S/D based trading ensures that no matter what happens in the market, you'll be ok. S/R is tried and tested and works over any market conditions. Good luck with it mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Appreciate if you could share more on how you look at the chart.. Hope to learn more from you.. I also try to focus on 3 main pairs: EJ, EA and GU..

--- 帖子 #599 ---
In two swings only? That's not a well tested method for me, no. You people are using words as "nay-sayers" and "trolls" just to hide the fact, that you are not providing all info you could be providing, because you simply do not want to. I don't have a problem with your method, or with the info you currently give out. I have a problem with keeping myfxbook private, learn to read.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Plague do you valid reasons this system cannot work (other than it has not been tested enough, that's what we are all busy doing here) or valid additions to the method? Pharley has shared his method with us because he wants to. If you don't have constructive criticism or something to add, I really don't see the point in you being here. No one asked him to share his myfxbook. He shared it in any case, now he has made it private so what. It's his decision, his account. If that bothers you so much, click the unsubscribe button easy as that. Hope you find that button, cheers!

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hi mate, I've been reading the thread from the start and I hope you can fix your issues soon! It's a great thread and I would love to learn more from you. I agree with what your saying that "My advice to anyone is to take a method of trading that is based on sound S/R or S/D principles and make it your own, master it, trade it. Because using S/R or S/D based trading ensures that no matter what happens in the market, you'll be ok. S/R is tried and tested and works over any market conditions." I am trying to incorporate these basic S/R stuff into what I have been trading (TMS). I believe any system needs to incorporate basic S/R and what you are doing is just stripping it down to the essence... i.e. taking trades off S/R ! If anyone doesn't believe this is a tradable system, I wouldn't pay too much attention to it. GL to all ! Best,

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Plague It just goes to show that you haven't really read pharley's method, he doesn't use fibs!!

Hi all, Here's some background reading on price action. Well worth the download and reading through it. It's by a bloke I was in contact with some years ago. This ebook explains so much about how to trade different set ups using PA and is one of the best I've come across. Nice and simple with lots of charts. The bloke who wrote it made a lot on a demo account at first, then went live and continued to make a heap and do very well. It's all common sense stuff and is a terrific referral book to look at and use to try and spot the same sort of set ups. Hope you find it useful as I have. It's a link to the download page - and I've tested it to make sure it works and doesn't come with any bugs! If it doesn't work let me know. http://swing-trading-strategies.com/...ding-download/

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Thanks! Something to read over the weekend!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Mobber - yes that's what I thought about - nice weekend reading! There's lots of info out there and written on the forum about all this. I suppose this puts it nicely in one place you can keep and refer to. The early bits of the book are for real newbs (if anyone is new to trading, read all of it!), but it soon gets interesting for the more experienced traders as well.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Thanks Pharley. Will take me more than a weekend.

Hello, Quick question: You've done your Weekly chart analysis and see that price has bounced off a support level and that the next significant resistance level is 1000 pips away. Your buy has worked out nicely and you're 150 pips in the green. Price isn't likely to move up 1000 pips by breaking out then pulling back before breaking out again (oh that it would!). What's the strategy for riding the move for the full 900 pips? thanks baked

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi Pharley, Thanks for your compliments. The PDF you shared resently is very usefull. I understand it comes down to a lot of screentime and learn to recognize the patterns to be succesfull in Forex. Thanks a lot for this PDF!! Just want to tell you I only us divergence (CCI, MACD) as a confirmation not as a main indicator and then mostly for trading S&amp;P500. The divergence shows if an overbought or oversold situation is exhausting and a early sign for the market to turn. It is is very usefull in combination with S&amp;R, but the main indicators for me are S&amp;R lines, channels and PA. Thanks to you! Question: Because of my work my time to trade will be limited in the next few month. I would like to trade on the daily charts and spent not more time then 30 to 60 minutes during daytime. Say only to check trades at different times. Should I only trade a few currencies 5 to 10 or what is your experience in timemanagement and forex? Already thanks for your answer, Dutch

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi Happytrade, I am just a student and still in the process of learning and still on demo! There are some good teachers here on this forum like Pharley and Stevepatt! Lots of succes! Dutch

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi, Yes you're right - price isn't likely to move that significant amount before retracing heavily. What I do is look for the most logical place to take profits. I attach a picture which shows 4 trades I took. When I look at this now price should have (and did eventually) move up to the top channel line. However I decided to take profits at near the high of the previous significant swing. I was pretty sure it would get to that level, but I'm never sure it will go the full distance - especially on channels. So take your profits at a reasonable level - don't be greedy to squeeze the last pip out of it as there are always more trades to be had. If I can get trades SL up to entry or better after a retrace, enter again and maintain the risk, then I just let price action go. Yes sometimes price comes back big time and hits SL but hopefully you've got the risk side of things sorted to lose a minimal amount. Then sometimes price only retraces a normal amount and just keeps going - these are the ones where you can make big dollars and % gains on your account. Each trade is unique due to the price action, where price is in relation to S/R etc. So it's important to be patient, look for price action and candles to tell you what's happening and manage the trades from that. Cheers

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi Dutch, Glad you find the pdf useful - I think it's terrific! Yes - no problem in trading off the daily chart at all. See attached pic which is the daily chart of GBPAUD. There are always trades to be taken off the daily as well and it has the added advantage of avoiding noise from lower time frames. At position 1 on the chart - resistance is drawn from the left out of shot, but the daily candle bouncing away from this resistance is great to play. Previous day had been up to it. So how to play? Various ways, but what about this - After yesterday had been up to that level and bounced away and closed, the next day price tried to get up there again. It also bounced away - you could enter short as price moves below the close of the previous day with SL above the resistance line, and target the last swing low - some 400 or 500 pips away. At position 2 - price went through the resistance and closed on the daily candle above it. The next day price went back (retraced) to the break area - typical price action. Enter long at the line or place an order to enter long above the high of the candle that closed above resistance. At position 3 - Price retraces again - same sort of thing as at position 2. In between 2 and 3 there are a couple of resistance/support flips. The first time price went through (now support), it went back up to the level, then fell around 200 pips. Then there was some ugly price action - may have lost a bit there, but nothing like the gains from all the other trades. Now if you look across several pairs (yes, say 5 to 10) there will normally be something to trade every other day. Here's the key - get your levels right. The support and resistance levels. Zoom out on the daily and draw in trend lines ad S/R - not many, just 1 or 2 near current price action. Wait for price to get there and see what happens. Look for where price may go to - what's the potential. Place limit orders if you can't watch the screens. Another advantage of this is you're letting price come to your trade and you're not chasing trades. If it triggers, great. If not never mind - there are always more to be had. Oh and look at daily candles for pin bars (limit orders playing the break in trend direction), piercing, railways, engulfing etc. Hope that helps mate.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Here is one I'm waiting for on the daily GBPAUD. I'm waiting for price to break above yesterday's high. I'm particularly interested when a 4hr (or even 1 hour) candle closes above it. Potential is about 400 pips or so. If price gets above yesterday's high, I'll look for a logical place to put SL based on 4hr or even 1hr candles, and try a TP at the top. But my TP will be either 90% of the move or just below the close of the swing high candles. I haven't had time recently to get on the forum or even look at charts too much - so I understand you Dutch in terms of time available! Try drawing S/R on daily charts like this and spotting some good set ups - there should be quite a few. Cheers

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hi Pharley, Thanks for your examples and good idea!! Did you place a pending buy stop order on the GBPAUD daily? Dutch

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi Dutch, Yes I did and due to work couldn't enter as I wanted. Ended up taking some stupid trades - see attached with green arrows showing the trades. Crazy - I'm trying to get away from trading like that. What I should have done is analyse the chart properly and taken a long trade off the support shown in the circle, or a long on the retrace back to yesterday's high, and targeted the next resistance line shown. That would have been a nice 150 pips. This is what I'm trying to aim at currently - getting those retrace back to support/resistance sorted and correct and leaving the trade alone to run to next logical level or hit SL. I'm getting there - it's just screen time, practice and patience. And hopefully not too many interruptions with work! That's always a pain. Cheers

Hello Pharley.. I must say i'm really happy i stumbled on your thread. its been an eye opener for me. Another strategy added to my trading arsenal.

Hi Pharley, many thanks for your refreshing and stimulatory thread. Having traded PA and SUP/RES in former times inspired by the James16 thread I went to other approaches cause it didn`t fit to my personality (need action, daily trades and quick results) though knowing that PA is - to my opinion- the best method to beat the markets. Having minimized my live account again I now learned from your posts that its possible to use PA almost daily with respectable efforts by building pyramids of trades if in a run....Your logical concept gives me the hope to build up my mini-account again... . Hope to be able to contribute to this thread if wished. Happy trading to all

GBPUSD Dayly Almost 500 pip range... The big question: are we going to bounce below again? I will be specially looking for a stop run...and some bullish candle after... At the moment, all those stops sitting there, work as an "magnet" for the big boys...relentlessly pushing in that direction...wonder how many retailer newbies are on their knees praying....

I agree with with you bro. The 200 EMA is one indicator to really watch. many traders make trading decisions around that level which then makes it a self fulfilling prophecy.

Hi Cuchuflito, I keep an eye on GU too, yesterday candle look like a doji, it can be nice. Otherwise, I look GJ too (look like pin bar on trendline support), and maybe I can take a better signal by knowing USD or JPY which is stronger (see UJ, it make a triangle, so interesting!) But I think I should wait more, today is friday, let action next week. This is only my view. Have a good time

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Check the level, and how it was stopped ran before... Stop runs, since created and executed by the Big Banks (liquidity pools for them),are followed by strong moves, cause they are behind the manipulation... Need to work for a confirmation, if the stop run happens, like a pin bar closing above the level, and above the body of the running candle...if it fails, then the level will become a resistance to go short later...

--- 帖子 #632 ---
The blue lines on these charts, are mostly taken from the monthly ... majour S/R... I´m just observing them...will study them on the weekend...see what people in the thread come up with as to trading opportunities... (BTW: Thanks Pharley,...thanks a lot!! I read a lot about adding to winners, definitely my style...exactly the opposite as to scaling out...which works negatively on your bottom line. The golden rule to trading:" keep winners big, loosers small." Scaling out, makes sure that your big winners will be half load, but your loosers are full loaded against you. With your method: the big winners are massive...patience is the key.) Nice weekend to everyone.

Between the bottom line (weekly Support), and the top (monthly), theres about 600 pips if you take the last pin bar long... I bet the Big Boys will run stops, either the bottom first, or the top first...or both....The top didnt get ran yet...only approached...not enough..cause probably now theres many people short, with a stop up there...waiting "sitting ducks".. BTW: if you look carefully, after the first run down from the top, there was a clear push up, to enteice retailers long, they got stopped out already...thats a bullish sign in my book.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi cuchuflito; It's all about Order Flow and who has control of the Market. Find where the losing Traders are going to have their Stop Losses and Trade into them and you will always have Market Momentum at your back.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Just a thought here... This may blow your mind.... Pick a random spot on your chart..... Draw a random horizontal support and resistance line at the spot you chose. Does price react to that level? Does it appear to be acting as support / resistance? How does this Random line hold up over time? Could you have taken good trades off this random line?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Hi Doerpn, thanks for your reaction. I was already in the trade on the 2nd break through the ema 200. There was some price action on another timeframe and the whole trend was going down. I thought it was a probability of 70% it would break the 200ema. Dutch

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Huh, I was just thinking of resurrecting this thread, and here we are. Looks to be lots of possibilities after brexit. E.g. NZD/USD. White lines are weekly support/resistance, dotted is daily. Price is sitting about the 50% retracement of that last huge down move and lots of wicks to the upside. Looking left there appears to be minor resistance about where it is now. I personally would put my stop above .73 (last highish), but you could also try above the area marked in red for something more aggressive. That's my take on it, definitely not advice, as I'm not even profitable on demo yet.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi Rub and thanks for your comment. The thread isn't dead - I've another one I'm also working on. Personally at the moment I'm leaving trading alone for a few days - although SR areas are normally respected by a great many pairs, these are not normal times in the FX area. Although the votes has been cast in favour of a leave for the UK, things are still up in the air with much turmoil. Trade at your own risk and be careful. Cheers Pharley

Well, I've got a 50% fib limit order in on EUR/NZD, but I'm starting to think it won't get hit. Also looking at NZD/USD, and maybe AUD/USD. Not seeing anything else at the moment though.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
All my entries so far have bombed. Couple at break even, most have been at a loss. If anyone's interested I'm doing a quick and dirty dump of Pharley's posts in this thread to a word document, which I'll upload when I'm done. Going to leave out the fluff if I can, and keep it to posts on how he runs things, and usefull comment.s currently looking at the aussie, kiwi, usd/chf and eur/nzd, for long, long, long, and short respectively. Maybe long gold if it breaks above my upper trendline.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Thanks for that - hope you get something out of it!

--- 帖子 #672 ---
thank you, I have learnt a lot from your posting, i hope you can post more live examples on this thread, i will keep learning, thank you !

Hi Pharley. Just reading through your support and resistance thread again. I had forgotten the the price action pdf download by Mandi Medang. Thanks for sharing this with us If you ever get the time to set a blog or a website up it would be great. regards kev

Hi Kevin, Thanks for your post. Yes I've been asked a few times to do one and haven't got around to it. At the moment I'm trying to stay away from doing a web blog - I just haven't got too much time currently to give to that. Perhaps in the future. Been an interesting week! I missed the huge move down on GBPJPY on USA election day - wrong time of the day for me entirely. But I scored huge when it went back up which is great. I hope others got some good trades out of the movement, tricky as it was. A huge pin bar appeared and I trades that, adding to it a couple of times - pin below. Hope others saw it too.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Besides the pin bar, there was also a nice break and retrace on the 4hr and 1 hr charts on GBPJPY - you can see the area below. These are 2 major things I look for - pin bars and break and retrace. The other major things are 50% retraces, inside bars and 2 bar reversals.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Pharley, Could you please restate you strategy if it is different from page 1.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi Earlroy, The strategy I posted on page 1 is still valid and I still use it. What I just posted about GBPJPY during some pretty extraordinary circumstances is something a bit different but not that much. I have a variety of approaches to trading - it's in my trading toolbox. The key things for me I mentioned above and involve support and resistance as does the method on page 1. I can't stress enough how important SR areas are (or supply/demand) ad together with that, candles and patterns. If I'm playing a pin bar, I'm looking for a major SR area where it forms. If I'm trading continuation patterns, I'm looking for inside bars on a trending pair and price is between major support and resistance areas. If I'm looking at 50% retracements (or any retracement), again I'm looking for the retracement to happen between major SR areas and a trending pair. Hope that helps. Cheers Pharley

Hi Pharley. Thanks for the reply. The two threads that you have kindly given here on forex factory have been enough. Thanks again Regards Kev

I am happy to see that you are back after your summer break Pharley. - I discovered this thread sometime in August and was worried that newcomers to this thread might not be able to ask questions from you that we may have in our endeavor to beat the market using your excellent thread. I agree with all those who think that current live trading examples are the best in order to enlighten us to fully comprehend your method. As for me I think this is the very best thread I've ever found on Forex Factory. Please keep up the good work Pharley. - I use your summary when I look for any potential trade setup: 1) Weekly chart, draw major SR levels. 2) Daily chart - wait for price to come to those areas. Look for price action candles - Pin Bars etc. 3) 4 hour chart for entries on 50% retraces, confirmed higher breaks, or retraces back to break points 4) Set SL at logical positions - normally last swing High or Low 5) Move SL up (or down) to the new trade SL point - this locks in profits 6) Target is the same for all trades - Measure the last move between S and R and take 90% as TP 7) Enter multiple times - Each time I get my SL up to the latest trade, I'm locking in profits. Most importantly my risk is remaining limited. 8) For the very first trade of a move, I only take half of my normal risk - this is because price can do anything, and it may go against me. 9) Once price moves in my favour I enter at my normal risk level. 10) I stop trading the run when reward to risk gets lower than about 2 to 1. 11) Sometimes I'll enter on continuation candles during the run, e.g. inside bars or pin bars, but I try and keep it as simple as possible.

Hi Seatac - and thanks for your comments and a great summary! What you've described is spot on for this method. Don't forget to look for flip trades on the daily, 4 hr, 1 hr candles as well. They form part of this method and happen all over the place time and time again. I often take flip trades as stand alone trades without adding to them, but I'll do the analysis as you've described to see if there is potential for a larger move and try to enter multiple times. Cheers Pharley

Hello Pharley, Thank you for sharing your 4H trading method, really quite valuable stuff for anyone migrating from indicators to PA. As I am going through your thread, taking notes, etc., i've noticed the website on SR is no available anymore. Do you have by chance a copy of this article? Cheers

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hi, Have a look at these 2 articles. http://maximumlots.com/supply-and-de...nd-resistance/ http://swing-trading-strategies.com/...rading-system/ Cheers Pharley

AUD/USD is at approx. the 50% retrace of the recent down move. I have entered a short.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hey guys, is there anyone who is still trading this method?

--- 帖子 #687 ---
I certainly am. There is another thread here https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=592827 but as with this one, not much activity, which is a shame. It's always good to have a chat about what we are looking at and possible setups but not much interest in it

--- 帖子 #688 ---
simple trading system make profit, thank you, pharley

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Hi Pharley! Thank you so much for your threads! Both of them are amazing thread for SR fans like me. I learned a lot from your shares and really want to thank you for your kindness to document it online in the free space like here. You could easily sell this for many thousands

--- 帖子 #690 ---
You're welcome!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi does anyone have a copy of this article. seems that the site is no longer available. could be worth a read to brush up on R&amp;S. if anyone has downloaded it or stashed it somewhere in the cloud / net, please assist. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hi Membina, you can go to post 683, Pharley gave another 2 links which are still working. And also it will be useful for you if you go through the whole thread to get better picture about Pharley's system. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #693 ---
What an informative thread ..... hats off to Pharley !!!

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Sorry, Is there any templates or indicators to use as part of this strategy?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
No template or indicators. It's a clean chart with lines for support and resistance levels. Go over the first post or the summery in post 176. It's all pretty simple, just takes practice. Here's an example of a trade run I've just started.

Got stopped out for a small loss.

NZDUSD is on weekly support. NZDUSD H4 : buy at 50% fib retracement.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Wow, thread sort of still going! Hope people have found some useful things on here. Keep it simple! Cheers Pharley

--- 帖子 #699 ---
A couple of simple flip trades on daily and 4hr charts recently taken - Spot these levels and trade them. See how price returns to the level. That's why SR levels/areas are so important. Look for these on your charts. Never forget flip trades!

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi Pharley! How are you? Hope you and your family are doing great! I missed your charts so much! Do you still trade the W1 levels and swing it with multiple positions? or you are actually doing the more relax trading now (1:1RR at S/R Flips)? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Pharley. Just a quick question. You are using fib on daily or 4hr time frame ?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
fx4shami, Pharley uses the fib on H4 timeframe to check 50% retracements. He uses modified fib on the D1 to look for the 90% profit area.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Pharley, Nice strategy. I'm a new trader and currently studying price action. I like this strategy of your that capturing very big profit because I don't mind the winning percentage. Currently trading CHFJPY with 4 open position and 500pips+.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Happy trading all - careful over December breaks.

Hi all, Well it's been about 8 years since I posted this thread and the other one, and getting on for 4 years since I posted at all. Been busy with life, work, trading etc. I'm just about retired now - forex trading has replaced my salary so I don't need to work any more. In fact I live overseas from my home base now. I hope people are still using price action - support and resistance. I just use horizontal lines on the simplest of charts and it seems to work for me nearly all the time. It's an old method to trade, but it works. Don't give up with it. Risk only 0.5% or 1% with a RR of 1:1.5 or 1:2 and following a decent strategy the profits should come. I'll mention it again - only risk max of 1% of your pot or funds if you can. Risk Mgt is THE most important part of trading. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hello PHarley, i have been learning how to trade since 3 years ago and yet haven't seen a single day in profit. Can you suggest me where to focus or what to be aware, maybe i am wrong all these years.I dunno I would really appreciate if you respond me, thank you

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi there, Sure I can try to help. It's best to send me a pm - let me know what you're doing with trading - how you're trading, timeframe, method, risk etc. Cheers

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Great to see you around pharley. One of the "Good Guys"folks.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Out of curiosity if you are still around Pharley, why did you first enter? I thought you were waiting for Daily to reach a support zone, which it did, and then give you a PA "confirmation" like a Pinbar or something.
