Hello everyone,

I’ve been working tirelessly over the course of the last few months to develop a system that I could be proud of and I believe I have finally completed my work. I’m bringing it to Forex Factory because I am of the opinion that its membership includes the best and brightest retail Forex minds in the world! I would appreciate all of your thoughts, comments and CONSTRUCTIVE criticisms as we move forward and attempt to perfect the following method.

Please do not post any additional indicators without valid back test results. The results should be posted for everyone to see. Similar to the results I have posted below.

I would like this thread to accomplish two goals:

1)      Educate new and experienced traders on the use of my trading method/system.

2)      Optimize the method until it reaches its maximum potential.

Now that we have the formalities out of the way I’ll go ahead and explain the method. I have attached all of the necessary components.

Pair: GBP/JPY (we may be able to add more pairs in the future)
Time Frame: M30

Indicators:
20      period RSI with the 50 level clearly defined 14      period ADX with the 25 level clearly defined Custom      Trend with default settings Forex Off Trend with default settings

I will explain the entry and exit parameters in the next few posts.

Please read post #250 after you have read posts 1-4.
Just a reminder, if you have not signed up for the trade signals via  Yahoo IM or Skype please send me a PM with you user ID and I will add you to the  list ASAP. It is much faster and easier to communicate with you all on  IM. There will be additional content available to those who join  such as updates to the system, a new and more aggressive system, videos  and much more. Those who sign up for IM or Skype will get updates and trade alerts long before  the forum will see them. For those viewing the thread who are not  members, my Yahoo IM ID and Skype ID is: fxtakeover

Feel free to add me and I'll return the favor!

Alright, let’s get to it. We are only concerned with three bars. The bar that starts at 9:30 AM EST and ends at 10:00 AM EST, the bar that starts with 10:00 AM EST and ends at 10:30 AM EST, and the bar that starts at 10:30 AM EST and ends at 11:00 AM EST. On my MT4 with forex.com these bars are: 13:30, 14:00, and 14:30.

Buy Signal:

If the following parameters are “TRUE” at the close of any of the bars mentioned above we will BUY at the market price.

1)      Custom Trend must be blue (teal)

2)      RSI must be above 50. Any reading above 50 is acceptable.

3)      ADX must be above 25. Any reading above 25 is acceptable. However, the ADX is more of a "Condition" than a trigger. If it is not above 25 at the close of the first bar there is no trade for that day.

Stop Loss = 100 pips (plus spread)

Break Even = Multi-purpose trade manager should move stop to break even at plus 100

Take Profit = 125 pips

Exit Buy Signal:

1)      When Take Profit or Stop Loss is reached

2)      If, on the following morning, you receive a signal in the opposite direction.

3)      If you are stopped out at break even.

4)      I will explain add-ons at a later point in time.

Please look at the screen shot(s).

Sell Signal:

If the following parameters are “TRUE” at the close of any of the bars mentioned above we will SELL at the market price.

1)      Custom Trend must be red.

2)      RSI must be below 50. Any reading below 50 is acceptable.

3)      ADX must be above 25. Any reading above 25 is acceptable. However, the ADX is more of a "Condition" than a trigger. If it is not  above 25 at the close of the first bar there is no trade for that day.

Stop Loss = 100 pips (plus spread)

Break Even = Multi-purpose trade manager should move stop to break even at plus 100

Take Profit = 125 pips

Exit Sell Signal:

1)      When Take Profit or Stop Loss is reached

2)      If, on the following morning, you receive a signal in the opposite direction.

3)      If you are stopped out at break even.

4)      I will explain add-ons at a later point in time.

Please look at the screen shot(s).

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Add On Signal:

If your first trade hasn’t reached its take profit by the next morning and you receive a new signal in the same direction, add on to the position. If the first trade has 50-100 pips of profit move its stop to break even. The take profit for the first trade should now be placed at the same price as the add on trade.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Wow!!!! I feel like I just wrote a novel!!! Feel free to comment and/or ask questions.

Michael

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Michael,

You sound like a proud papa! Can you supply your trading results with us? How long have you been trading your system?

Thanks,

BC

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks for posting.. Will give it a shot tomm morning

What are the other indicators in the 1st post

Multi purpose trade manager and GBPJPY daily buy/sell

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This is a brand new system. I have 16 months worth of back testing data starting 01/01/09 and ending 04/30/10. I would have tested farther back but the results I've come up with are fairly consistent and manual back testing takes FOREVER! Feel free to test it beyond that point if you wish. I am definitely NOT opposed to other traders checking the data and back  testing it to check for any errors I might have made. I started forward testing on a demo account this week but there have been no valid trades. Here is a spread sheet with the data.

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #9 ---
The Multi purpose trade manager is an EA that everyone can use. I'm using it to move my stop to break even after the trade reaches 100 pips in profit. I'll attach the instructional pdf to my first post. The GBPJPY Daily Trend Buy/Sell are scripts for entering the market. I find that it's much faster than manual order entry but that's just my preference.

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hey everyone,

I just updated the Entry and Exit posts. I forgot to add a sentence about the ADX. Make sure you read it. I've also update post #1 to include the instructional pdf for the multi purpose trade manager.

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #11 ---
What is the use of Gbp/Jpy Daily Trend Buy / Sell indi?????

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Please refer to post #9. They are scripts.

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Michael,

Did u try this method with other currencys than G/J ?

Thanks iT

--- 帖子 #14 ---
No. I haven't got that far yet. I would think the more volatile pairs such as GBP/USD and EUR/JPY would be interesting pairs to look at. Feel free to test it on other pairs and let us know what you find. I'll begin to look into it as well.

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Less than an hour to go before trade time. Looks like a short may be setting up.

Michael

--- 帖子 #16 ---
If all three bars, this morning, satisfy entrance requirements, will you open three trades, or is it just one a day?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Just 1 trade for now. It looks like we will have a sell signal when the current bar closes. The other bars will not matter. Maybe we can look into that in the future

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Took the sell signal @ 136.44

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I think I need to review the scripts. The stop loss was a bit too high. I'll work on that for you all.

Michael

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Did anybody take that trade?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I took it on a demo.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Can you show the present chart with entry rules?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Here ya go.

Michael

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Same here.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
why didn't u chose 9:30 AM EST candle, RSI is above 50 and ADX is above 25, Trend is also Red..

any specific reason??

--- 帖子 #26 ---
That was the 9:30 AM EST candle.

It ended at 10:00 AM.

He shows entrance at 10:00 AM.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Take another look at the screen shot. The 13:30 candle on forex.com MT4 starts at 9:30AM EST and closes at exactly 10:00AM EST. So technically, I did use the 9:30 bar. If you need further explanation let me know.

Michael

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for the help Bill.

Michael

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Here's my screen shot.  Looks good to me.  What do you think?

=Ed=

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I got it thanx a lot.

thnx bill.

I made little late now is on our way.

Good Luck Allzzzzz

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Looks like you entered an hour late.

Michael

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Here's a better screen shot that clearly identifies the 09:30 bar.

I outlined the three bars in yellow to make it easier to see.

We'll see how the trade goes.  =Ed=

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Ed,

Did you enter at the close of the 9:30 AM EST bar? If not, you should have.

Michael

--- 帖子 #34 ---
OK.  Let me get it straight then:  If all the conditions are met at the close of the 10:30 bar (which will be 11:00 Eastern), then you enter the trade; otherwise not.

Correct?

Thanks,

=Ed=

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Oh crap.  I just re-read the conditions and have answered my own question:

"If the following parameters are “TRUE” at the close of any of the bars mentioned..."

Sorry.  I simply must learn to slowly read these things!

=Ed=

--- 帖子 #36 ---
LoL......that's ok man. I think we all have that problem. I've had to edit a bunch of my posts to get things straight so don't feel bad!

Michael

--- 帖子 #37 ---
OK.  I just bailed out of that trade I took, fortunately making a $211 profit!

I'll study the system a lot more over the coming days and be much more careful in the future.

Thanks for giving us a good system to work with.

=Ed=

--- 帖子 #38 ---
No problem Ed. Hopefully you are trading on a demo account. Looks like it's time for me to mow the lawn. I'll be back on this afternoon.

Everybody feel free to ask questions and post screen shots.

Michael

--- 帖子 #39 ---
No; I trade live.  Been trading for quite some time and manage to keep a lid on things.  Just looking for ways to make my life a bit easier, rather than to sit here and stare at the computer screen all day.

Will catch you later,

Ed

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hey.....whatever works for ya, right??!!

Michael

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You got it!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hello MichaelLee_8,

The pdf says "Put remove stop losses" in the script folder. I don't see any file named this. Also where do the 'daily trend buy/sell' go. Are they scripts?

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #43 ---
The PDF is for the multi purpose trade manager. I didn't write the EA or the PDF. I found it here on forex factory. So I don't know what "Put remove stop losses" means.

Yes, the GBPJPY Daily Trend Buy/Sell are scripts and should be placed in the scripts folder. I have been away at a friends all evening but will try to update the scripts tonight. They have a tiny issue with the placement of the stop loss. I think they place it at 110 or 115 instead of 100.

I will read over the PDF to see if I can figure out what you mean.

Michael

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Oh, by the way, my trade from this morning was a winner. Anybody else have the same result?

Michael

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I'm still in it.

It missed TP by 4 pips. That's probably because of the spread.

Do you take trades on Friday and carry them over the weekend?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Bill,

Yes, take Friday trades and hold them over the weekend.

What was your entry price? I'm showing a low of 134.92 between 8:00 and 8:30 PM EST

Michael

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Entry price was 136.36.

Low was 134.90.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Interesting.....did you not get a fill on your exit order? Take profit should be at 125 pips and looks like there was a 146 pip move in your favor?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Today's trade seems fine, but if I look at other 3 days, all seems to be either looser or no trades. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
1st trade with this system. seems good let's see what will it produce in next 1-2 weeks.

Thanx for sharing...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
My mistake.

I set it the TP at 150.

I hit it though.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes, this was the first trade of the week. The first two trades here in May were stopped out and the next two were winners. That puts us up 50 pips for the month.

Michael

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks for taking the time to try it out.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Nice.....a few extra pips to pad your.....uh....Demo account LoL

--- 帖子 #55 ---
If the ADX doesn't have a change of heart here in the next 15 minutes, there will be no trade for today.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
It's official. No trades for today. Once again, thanks for checking out the system and feel free to post any questions or comments. Have a great weekend everyone!

Michael

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thank you, Michael and have a good weekend too.

Just small question, before entry, is it important that price is closing above or under Custom Trend line?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
No, not at this time. I have several similar variables that I need to back test. Unfortunately, manual back testing takes a lot of time. Feel free to look back over the last 1-2 years and see if that could be a good filter.

The other filter that I'm looking at is the possibility of using the 25 level on the ADX as an entry trigger. Right now the Custom Trend and RSI(20) are the triggers and the ADX is a simple filter.

The screen shot below is a good example. If we follow the rules laid out at the beginning of the thread we would not take a trade. However, if we allow the ADX to act as a trigger along with RSI and Custom Trend we would have a long entry at the close of the 14:30 bar. See the difference?

Michael

--- 帖子 #59 ---
First of all, many thanks Michael for sharing this strategy with us.

I'm following all the subject since the beginning and I have a little question, or just a confirmation for the entry.

As you can see on the picture, I've marked the 3 bars in a yellow box according to your settings, a sell signal appears, so we enter a sell order at the open price of the next candle (the 4ht) isn't it ?

And just to be correct, the TP of 125pips is hited the next day (14 May) at 134.62 ?

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks for the kind words. Your entry is off by a few bars. Please go back and read the posts 2 and 3.

Sell Signal:

If the following parameters are “TRUE” at the close of ANY of the bars  mentioned above we will SELL at the market price.

So, in short, your time range is correct. Your RSI is below 50, Custom Trend is red, and ADX is above 25. So you did everything the correct way except for which bar you entered on. Here's a screen shot.

Michael

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks Michael for your explanations,

but I think we are saying the same thing  on your chart you enter the new sell order the 2010.05.13 15:00 at the open price of the bar 135.88 and on my chart I open the new trade the 2010.05.13 at 18:00 (GMT +1) with the same open price.

So  all seems OK.

Thanks

Regards

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Incorrect. I clearly state on my chart that you should have entered at the close of the 13:30 Bar. That bar represents 9:30 AM - 10:00 AM EST if that makes it any easier.

Let me know if I can do anything else to help you.

Michael

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Arff I think I find my misunderstood :-(, I have to improve my english I think

I believed that the Buy/Sell signal should be on the 3 bars and not at ANY of these.

Before, I checked all settings for the 3 bars and if only one do not correspond to the expected settings, the signal was not valide.

But according to your rules, only one bar (on your chart 13h30, 14h, 14h30) corresponding to the settings validate the signal.

I think that now I understood exactly your rules

Many thanks Michael, I forward my tests.

Regards

--- 帖子 #64 ---
It's no problem. Let me know if you need anything else. I'll be posting all of my trades so you should be able to follow along.

EURNZD daily ADX at max ..what we do?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
You've posted in the wrong thread; this method is about the GBP/JPY.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Michael,

Could you explain what the reasons you choose 3 bars that starts at 9:30am EST? Is it based on the New York open? If it is true, can we also use others market hours, for example London open at 7:00am GMT 0 (2:00am EST) for this wonderful method?

Many thanks for sharing this method.. may the green pips always be with you

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yes the New York open had a lot to do with it. I have noticed that the markets usually find their direction between 9:30 am est (N.Y. Open) and 11:00 am est (London Close).

I would encourage you to test out the different sessions and see what you come up with. I can only test 1 variable at a time so that would be a HUGE help. The other times that I would like to test are 7:00 PM EST and 5:00 AM EST.

Michael

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Nice to have you here Dreamliner. I read through your thread about correlation trading and really enjoyed it. I hope it's still working for ya.

Michael

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks Michael, yes I still do correlation trading. It's got a lot of down points to it because of the scaling of the program, so I only do one a month or so.

Looking forward to seeing your plan in action here.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yeah, the scaling did cause quite a few problems. That's why I like to use the correlated pairs as a leading indicator.

Hopefully this method will come through for all of us!!

Michael

--- 帖子 #72 ---
It looks good so far, on backtesting at least. I'd love to see someone take you up on the 7:00 PM backtest.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Busy taking myself up on that right now!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Great! Maybe some helpers will come along too.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thank you for sharing your system. I have been interested in the GPYJPY pair as well as the EURJPY. I'd like to ask some questions about it:

Have you considered measuring the volatility as a way of updating your SL and TP, maybe using ATR? In more volatile days/weeks the SL could be hit easier and the same trade could aim for more profit as well.

Also, did you consider alternative exits like scaling out of your position? For example, taking a portion of the order at 100 pips and the rest at 150? I wonder if it would work out.

Cheers,

TF

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Michael,

For what it's worth, let me tell you the future of this thread. Because you have asked for input (admirable) and have placed no rules around the kind of input, you will have everybody and their brother giving you a thousand different indicators as ways to enter, manage or exit. Your thread will become entirely bogged down in indicators. I have seen this over and over.

People will come here and say "what about this?" or "what about that?" And nobody will have done any backtesting on it, they will just add their favorite indicator into this system you have developed.

My suggestion to you would be to request that people not simply say "what about adding..." but rather that they actually do some backtesting and provide their results. You have provided your results in a nice Excel file, they would simply need to show the difference in results using their favorite indicator.

This way your thread will not become bogged down with a thousand "what ifs".

It's your call, of course, I am just telling you what will happen to your thread if you don't require people to do any work in backtesting before presenting their favorite indicators/methods.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thanks for taking the time to give the system a try. Let me know how EURJPY works out. I haven't had the chance to test it.

Yes, I have considered the topics in your questions. The ATR is something that we can probably add to our forward testing in the future. In my opinion it is pointless to use it during back testing.

I'm not against anyone scaling out of a position. However, I tried to optimize the sl/tp as much as possible and the best settings I found were 100sl and 125tp. I also tried 50sl/50tp 50/75 50/100 100/100 100/150.

Anyway, I'm just going to try and keep things simple until we get a solid base of traders who understand and are trading this system. But feel free to tweek things as you see fit and let us all know how it goes.

Michael

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Very excellent and valid point. I'll try to add some language to the first post to make that clear. Thanks for the insight!!

Michael

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Good morning traders!! I have attached an updated spread sheet for everyone to look at. During the craziness that is back testing I make a small mistake on the first 4 months. I have adjusted the numbers and the total pip count is down about 350 pips.

Transparency is key and I will give additional updates if I find any more mistakes. Once again, thanks for joining the thread and I hope this system serves you well.

Michael

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Traders, please go back and read the first post. Thank you for cooperating!!

Michael

--- 帖子 #81 ---
MichaelLee_8

If I have your timming correct, we are waiting for two more bars to start looking for a signal. Can you confirm. If I'm right it doesn't look good for a trade today.

Mitch

--- 帖子 #82 ---
The current bar is not relevant. The close of the next bar is what we are concerned with.

If the risk rally continues we will have a trade.

Michael

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Barring a huge sell off, we will have a trade in approx. 29 minutes.

Michael

--- 帖子 #84 ---
GBPJPY found a bit of resistance @ the 38.2% ret. Looking for more of a rally. The sell off has been extreme.

Michael

--- 帖子 #85 ---
This would be a perfect entry for a push into the 50% ret. The dominant down trend has me a little paranoid but the recent higher low could be in our favor. Thoughts anyone??

Michael

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Follow your system.

If you make it up as you go, it isn't a system.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Easy there bill. The system will be followed I assure you. It was just a question.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I probably didn't mean it the way it came across.

If you have backtested a set of rules and they are profitable, then go with them.

Don't try to second guess yourself.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Cool. A misunderstanding......I was talking about a good system entry. It's cool....I get what you are sayin.

Michael

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I believe in sticking with your system but the 38.2 has been a strong resistance. Would it not be wise to wait to see if one of the 3 bars closes above the 38.2 before taking a Buy Trade

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I hear ya. However, we are going to forward test the same way we back test. Entry in less than a minute baby!!

Michael

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Went long and got filled @ 133.49

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Bought at 133.50

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I think there is always a TA reason to not take a trade.

It may be a fib you don't like, some candle formation you don't like, it may be butting heads with some moving average...etc.

Something can always be found.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Long at 133.53

--- 帖子 #96 ---
In at 133.53

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Couldn't have said it better Bill! BTW, I hope everyone is trading this on a demo account.

For you crazy people who are willing to trade it live, I suggest 1% risk.

Michael

Rockin out to a little AC/DC baby!!!! Gotta love Pandora.com

Good luck to all.... Go Blackhawks!!!!!

Currently working on the 7:00 PM EST back test and rockin out to Motely Crue! So far, so good! Will post results when I'm done.

Michael

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Looks like the risk rally is having a difficult time.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
There it is traders....the first stop out.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Total May Pips: -50

--- 帖子 #105 ---
That's what you want- the results of a forward test.

Forward testing your rules will let you know if you need to change them.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Yep

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi,

The buy signal was here , the RSI was just a little over the 50 level  argg

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Did everyone else hit SL today?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I here ya...

Almost done with the 7:00 PM EST Back Test...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hey traders,

I just attached an updated spread sheet to post #1 that has the back test results for 7:00PM EST. It returned just over 2500 pips in 16 months (01/09-04/10). The results include trading on Sunday. However, I'm currently looking back at the data to see if trading Sunday night is lucrative. My first impression is no but we'll see.

Michael

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I'm still live on this mornings trade, shame on me forgot to place my stop-loss! I'm testing live, .01 lots, currently at 42 pips. Retirement is just around the corner at this rate!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
You're crackin me up mitch!! I'd move that stop up to break even if I were you.

Maybe you should use the scripts that I've provided in post #1.

Michael

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Yeah I was stopped out.....technically, everyone should have been stopped out....MITCH

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I never get stopped out. I sometimes get phone calls from my broker asking me to add money to my account but I never hit Stops.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
LMAO!!! That's awesome!!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Michael, in your 7:00 PM backtests, I assume you mean EST correct?

Are you still looking at 3 bars? The 7-7:30, then the 7:30-8, then the 8-8:30. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
WoW!! Great timing. I just finished. Yes, I am still looking at 3 bars and yes I mean Eastern Standard Time.

The bars are actually 6:30-7, 7-7:30, and 7:30-8 (all EST)

I've updated the spread sheet in post #1. Take a look. I think that trading on Sunday night makes things a bit more smooth. What do you all think?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Long at 134.02

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Darn.....I was doing the dishes and missed it. I'll put in an order for the closing price of the 6:30-7:00 bar.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
That's the one that just closed; you mean you'll put an order in for the 7:00-7:30 bar?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
No...I really did mean the 6:30-7:00 bar's closing price. It's the exact same as the morning trade.

Michael

--- 帖子 #122 ---
But you wrote that at about 7:15. How could you put an order in for the bar that closed at 7:00?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I'm not in the trade yet. I just put a "pending buy stop" order for 133.98 with a stop at 132.93 and a take profit at 135.23

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi:  I just came across this method an I am a newbie, but I went back and looked at all last week and todays trade and each time there was a trade which I think there were 3 trades last week and today's trade and each trade got stopped out.  Is that correct.

Thanks

Darvin

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hey Darvin,

Nice to see you here. The first two trades of the May were stopped out. The next two were winners. Today's trade was stopped out. Total May pips: -50

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Traders,

The 7:00PM EST trade Total May Pips= 118

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Guys i have tried this  method on the 4 hour charts with good results, no timing required, just make sure the indicators line up. SL & TP are last significant S & R.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hey Cosmo,

Thanks for looking into my method. What you are proposing seems a bit different than what we are doing here. Would you mind defining "good results" for us?

Michael

--- 帖子 #132 ---
This trade has not hit either take profit or stop loss, we are still in this trade.

Entry was at 134.02.

Low after that has been 133.11

High has been 134.82

Is this your calculation too? (Give or take a few pips)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
That's funny I was just about to comment. You're talking about the trade from 7pm last night correct?

I'm a little sea sick from watching the price action on that trade. We stay in the trade until the SL or TP is hit. Although, we may look to change that in the future, that's the way I back tested it.

Michael

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Good morning traders! I'm currently back testing 5:00AM EST to see if it's a lucrative time to implement this method. I'm done with May, June, and July of 2009. The results aren't looking very good but I'll keep you all updated.

Watching Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It's crackin me up!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yes, that was the trade I am talking about. I just noticed you posted this: "The 7:00PM EST trade Total May Pips= 118"

So I was responding that this trade has not hit take profit or stop loss.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I was talking about the Total number of pips for May. Not last nights trade.

NO Trade today

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Even if next two candles closings will qualify for entry?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
No. If ADX is below 25 at the close of the 9:30-10:00 bar there is no trade. ADX is not used as an entry trigger. That's what the RSI and Custom Trend are for.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Is it the same for 6:30-7:00 pm candle?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yes. Everything is the same except for the time.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Traders, last nights 7pm trade was just stopped out. Total May Pips: 18

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Looking to go short in a few seconds.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Short @ 131.38

Please remember that the 7:00PM trades were not nearly as profitable as the 10:00AM trades. However, both times combined returned approx. 8500 pips in 16 months according to the back test. That's why I made the decision to trade it as well as the 10:00 AM.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I entered short half hour later... got confused with the times. Now I know it is half hour earlier. At least I entered in a good spot @ 131.62. I'm +24 as we speak.

This is a stress-free and easy to follow system. I think the afternoon trade is worth pursuing based on the backtest data.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Michael,

I am on Forex.com (UK) and at the close of the 14:30 bar I had the trend indicator red, RSI at 46,8890 and the ADX at 25.2018 (moving up from the  13:00 bar). Wouldn't you consider this an a sell signal, marginal I admit)? An easy win, just like the Blackhawks tonight!

Mitch

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Yeah....I got in late yesterday because of dish washing duties. I just put a pending order out there and got a good fill.

Thanks for the compliments. I've put a lot of work into this system and I hope that people stick with it for a couple months.

Michael

--- 帖子 #153 ---
What day are you looking at? Remember that the ADX is NOT a trigger for entry. Give me a minute and I'll find a good example to post.

Michael

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Michael, I'm looking at this mornings bars. Let also go back and re-read the first post.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Sounds good. Almost ready with the example.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Michael

I now understand the condition, we take the ADX reading on the first bar only!

Sorry for the confusion

Mitch

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Not quite......hang on

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Ok, here they are.

Now, if the ADX had gone below 25 we would not have taken this trade. Regardless of the RSI and Custom Trend. They are triggers and ADX is the filter. The filter has more weight than the other 2.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Michael,

Thanks for the example charts, I have a clear understand now!

Mitch

--- 帖子 #160 ---
No problem.

Missed the break even point by 4 pips!!!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I know... momentum seems to be in our favor and hopefully the trend will resume.

Have you thought of giving a name to your system?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
No not really. I don't know what to call it. Do you have any ideas?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
You can call it anything you want. I would name the system after a river, based on the way the Custom Trend moves.

Tonight trade is not looking so good...

Michael, i have looked back at trades to the start of 2010 and your method seems to filter out 'bad' trades on the 4 hour TF.

I normally only trade the daily TF but am using your method on the 4 hour prior to entering a trade on the daily, also thanks for sharing your method.

Traders,

I just tested 4/09-8/09 and used 5:00 AM EST as the start time.

Total Pips: -1396

August was down over a thousand pips by itself!! So 5:00AM EST is a no go. I think someone mentioned 2:00 AM EST so I'll test that next.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Euro rallying hard here......Could be the start of a massive and overdue short squeeze.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
How about ADX 25 System?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Michael,

I guest that was me who said that  My question first, it it correct that the 3 bars you pick is 1,5 hours after the NY open? NY open at 8:00 AM EST right? If it's correct, so for the London open we would be using the bars that start at 4.30 AM EST, since London open at 3:00 AM EST.

Let me know if it's wrong..

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hmmmmmmm.....catchy. I like it. Anybody else have any ideas??

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Yes, you are correct. However, the last hour of trading for London is 10-11am est. That's part of the reason I picked those bars. The market gets a lot of it's direction for the day during this time period.

I believe that every open/close is going to be different. For example, most of the European markets open BEFORE London. Germany is the largest economy in Europe so I think starting 2 am est would be a good time to start. However, all of my thoughts and beliefs are subject to back testing.

Thanks for your thoughts and feedback. I appreciate it!

Michael

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Traders,

Looks like a long trade is setting up but who knows. It's been a crazy morning! Been up since 4:30 est and the moves have been completely insane!

Very nice movements off of the pivot levels recently.

Cool.....did you trade the 7pm signal from last night?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Reached my TP too

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Long @ 131.74

The spreads I'm getting on Forex.com MT4 are lame. All my live trades are placed with fxcm. I usually don't see a GBPJPY spread outside of 4.8-5.1

I'm seeing spreads of 5-10!! Maybe because it's a demo.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Long - 131.69

--- 帖子 #184 ---
You suck

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Yes, actually I don't like starting at 4:30 AM EST too. It would be a big missed. I noticed the price usually move right after London open. So, I agree with you at 2:00AM

I'm finding a few interesting tid bits of information from all of the back testing data.

1) February has not been positive for the last 3 years!!!

2) May has not been positive for the last 2 years. (We aren't done with 05/10 yet)

3) I'm going to test a new entry condition. Price must be within 130 pips from the Custom Trend.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Traders,

Should be long from around 131.94 for the 7:00pm trade.

Anyone else in on the 7pm trade?

Cool....working on a bunch of modifications.....does anyone have any free time on their hands?? LoL

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I'm workiing on forward testing on a small Live account I opened up for testing secondary methods. I will post updates of results here in this thread.

Since you coded the indicator, I was wondering if you could code some kind of alert sound/email notification that notifies me of a change of the trend bar color from red and blue when a bar closes.

This is your indicator. Can you add this to help with forward testing. If you can't do email an alert sound / popup will be fine.

(hmm something seems to have happened to my account...my posts are reset)

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I found the indicator. It's also called Slope Direction Line. I have attached one with an email alert that I found here on FF.

I would not test this method on a live account. May has not been friendly in the past and is certainly not being friendly now. I would only take it live when we have all the bugs worked out.

Thanks for your interest in the method.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi

I'm keeping an interested eye on your experiment. I trade longer time frames using support and resistance lines and trading in direction of trend.

Right now this pair is at important support around 130. It looks like you may have a trade upcoming on your system for a short, is that right?

Larry

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Yes that is correct. Thanks for your interest. It is definitely an "experiment". I'm just about done testing all of 2008 for the 10:00 am trade and the results have not been kind. There were massive amounts of counter trend trades. It was as if Europe started the counter trend rally and it ended around 10 am just in time to stop the trades out. If you look at the trades from this May you will notice that 3 of the trades that have been stopped out have been counter trend. This is a BIG problem and frustrating to say the least! Any ideas on how to stay out of those counter trend trades?

However, this method was actually spawned from another that closely mirrored one of TEB's systems. Once I complete the testing of 2008 I'll begin to see how my original thought played out in 2008. It's based on taking the first signal you get between 10am-1pm with a target of 200 and stop of 50. I only have a few months of data for the original so it may be a while before I can post a valid spread sheet.

Traders,

If you have any ideas or thoughts that could make the system better feel free to share them.

Michael

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Michael, Do you add Trailing stops to the trade? I thru a T/S 24 on the trade and it still hit TP 100.

I was thinking that Trailing stops would help get to Breakeven faster to minimize the stop loos.

thanks

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Yeah I've had the same thought. It's just hard to back test a trailing stop. Why don't you keep trading it like that and let us know how your trades do? I think that would be easier than trying to back test it. Plus, I only have so much time on my hands

Michael

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I will keep you updated, I just attached Steve Hopwood's Trade Management EA. I love this EA because of all the different settings in it.

It has TP, S/L, B/E and T/S settings, all you do is put the settings in the EA and when you make a trade (manually)the Ea puts in TP, S/L, B/E and T/S for you.

You should be able to find the EA on forex factory or by doing a google search.

thanks

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Yeah there are a bunch of those out. I have the multi purpose trade manager attached to post #1

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I forgot to ask what are the time you look to trade this system?

I saw on the 1st post that you only trade once a day, but it looks like that you trade during the day and evening too.

Can you clarify.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Currently looking at 10 am est and 7pm est

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Traders,

Just finish testing 2008. Ugly, but could have been much worse! Take a look.

I'm also including a template that marks where all of the trades are. I had to test it on FXCM instead of forex.com mt4 because of a lack of history. Don't pay attention to anything outside of 2008 because it might not be correct. Most of the entry lines are at 14:30(10am on FXCM's mt4).

Blue Vertical Line= Buy

Red Vertical Line= Sell

White Vertical Line= Exit

Please let me know if you have any ideas that can increase the performance. It would be a big help.

Current Filter Ideas To Test:

1) Don't take the trade if price is more than 130 pips from the custom trend

2) Change the settings on the Custom Trend

3) Only take short trades when price is below 200 EMA and vice-versa for long trades

4) Experiment with trailing stops

5) Use an ema cross as an entry trigger instead of Custom Trend. This would eliminate "blind" entries but we would probably have to wait a while for a signal.

I won't be able to take the 7pm trade (if there is one) tonight because I'll be out putting a swing together for my nephew. However, I'll check in later tonight.

7:00 PM trade was stopped out. May continuing to be a rough month. Like I mentioned earlier, it does not have a good historical performance.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi,

Please find a small backtest for April 2010.

* 20 period RSI with the 50 level clearly defined

* 14 period ADX with the 25 level clearly defined

* Custom Trend with default settings

Stop Loss = 100 pips (plus spread)

Take Profit = 125 pips

Break Even = 100 pips

For the moment, I do not handle correctly the ADX filter, because I check it at 9:30 AM EST, 10:00 AM EST and 10:30 AM EST like other indicators to confirm a signal.

Michael, could you please check the trades and tell me which were wrong and should not be taken.

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks for putting some work into the system. I really appreciate it! Checking your back test now.

Here is another template which has the trades from 5/09-present marked the same way as the template above. You should find it useful.

Michael

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Yousky,

There was a long entry on 4/1/10 that was good for approx 168 pips because of a weekend gap in our favor.

Trade #1 is not valid. Remember, if the ADX is not above 25 at the close of the 9:30-10:00am bar there is no trade for the day.

Trade #4 should be short not long and should have been stopped out.

Trade #9 according to my data would have been a 125 pip winner. However, everything depends on spread. It was very close I'm sure.

Trade #12 was good for approx. 201 pips because trade #13 was an add-on signal. Remember, the take profit for trade #12 should have been moved to match the take profit of trade #13. In other words, the take profit for both should have been 144.84 according to your data.

Everything else looks similar to my results.

Michael

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Traders,

Looks like a short trade is setting up.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Well Scratch that.....ADX now below 25 and picking up steam. Personally, I'm kind of happy about that especially with the week that we've had. I would hate to get nailed with a gap against us!

Michael

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I realise that the trade is valid according to the rules, but I am so uncomfortable with the price being above the trendline that I am waiting for the next candle/s

Larry

ps. made some pips on a late entry to the afternoon trade on my demo a/c, exit came from the trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
That's fine Larry. At the end of the day it's your account.

I realize that the entries desperately need to have greater accuracy. That's why I've been working so hard on finding a better set-up and I believe I'm on to something.

Preliminary Results:
Original 10am Trade 5/09-present

4998 Pips 53.59% win percentage

New 10am Trade 5/09-present

5450 Pips 62.26% win percentage

I'm now going to compare the results for 2008.

Traders...I have a few exciting updates that I should be able to post in a few minutes. Looks like we have a long trade setting up for 10 am with the original system. However, the modified system I've been working on is not confirming that signal.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
sounds great on more confirmation for the signals.

last night was ugly for GJ.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
This will be the last week for the original system. The decision is not based on May's performance but on the performance over the last 3.5 years. Take a look at the attached spread sheet and you'll see the difference. I've also attached a new template and indicator for everyone. I'll post a couple of screen shots to show you all the new approach. It's almost identical to the original.

Thanks for sticking with me,

Michael

--- 帖子 #247 ---
thanks for you hard work, can't wait to try the new system.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
No problem. Thanks for sticking around. Did you check out the spread sheet?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Ya it's looking good, we'll just have to keep working and refining the system.

I like trading the GJ monster but it's a really crazy pair to trade.

thanks

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Here are some screen shots for everyone. All of the original system's rules still apply. The difference is the forex off trend indicator. If the blue line is above the red and all of the other conditions are met, you have a long trade. If the red line is above the blue line and all of the other conditions are met, you have a short trade. The blue line seems to have a shift of -1 and I couldn't figure out how to remove that from the code. So, if the lines are too close and the trade isn't obvious, use your cursor to define the values. Remember, this system is a work in progress. We will add and subtract from the system according to valid back test results.

Michael

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yeah....I call it the beef eater!!

I took the 10am trade at 130.81 and it has done well stop is above entry already, what about the new system, any entry?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
So no 10 a. m. trade today?

Well now we need to wait. The ADX is still above 25 so we need to see if our triggers line up here on the next two bars.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Bay,

It looks like the custom trend is going to be red at the close of the current bar if the current bar stays at it's current level.

Michael

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Aga, we have two more candles. If ADX will go less then 25, at the closing of 10:30- no trade?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Very good!. I think you've got it down.

I don't think the ADX is going to be a concern though. It's well above 25 and is slow to change course. The custom trend is what we are most concerned with at this point.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Yes....we only exit a trade based on the parameters laid out on page one. Gaps tend to play in our favor on a historical basis.

I've got to go for now. I have a few things to take care of. I'll check back this afternoon.

Michael

Dont see much downside in G/Y, because EUR/GBP is crashing

E/Y is better short

--- 帖子 #290 ---
This system is for GBPJPY. I understand your opinion. Take a look at these screen shots.

If you would like to back test the system on EURJPY and report back with your results that would be great.

Michael

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Looks like we may have to wait for a bit....indicators are in lala land right now....

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Looks like it's trying to roll over from the 50% ret of the last leg down.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
No entry for this bar.....the waiting game is on

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks for the offer. The information found in this thread should be enough to get you started, correct?

Michael

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Two more bars, yes?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
GBPJPY trying to get a hold on that 50% ret level @ 133.65

Next stop would likely be 134.25 (61.8% ret)

--- 帖子 #298 ---
are we buying on the next candle?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Yes.....if price stays where it is currently.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Long @ 133.643

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I have a feeling that this could be a short trade...

--- 帖子 #303 ---
What do you all usually get for a spread?? I'm getting 4.5-5

--- 帖子 #304 ---
mine is 8.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Ouch.....who is your broker?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
i'm from Ukraine, so you probably don't know it. it's "brokbusiness"

--- 帖子 #307 ---
You should find their office and kick someone in the balls!!

They should give you a better spread than that. Oh well. Work with what you've got, right? How's your country holding up with all of the crap hitting the fan in the EU?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
haha, they have the highest spread for gbp/jpy (well, except gold).

Ukraine isn't in EU so it doesn't affect us that much but we have our own problems as corruption, mafia etc.

Our currency "grivna" is 9:1 to eur.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I think every country has a problem with corruption. Believe it or not I did know that Ukraine wasn't a part of the EU. I read something recently that was saying that interbank lending was getting all screwed up for everyone over in Europe so I thought it might be affecting you guys.

Wasn't Ukraine trying to get into the EU here in the last couple years? Or maybe I'm thinking of one of the other western European nations.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yea, we were, but now we have different president - Yanukovich wich is prorussian

Sell Setup on daily chart

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Correct, but if you would test the new strategy, I need "blue & red line cross" indicator with the new rules (i.e.: margin of crosses)

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I think page 17 has the information that you are looking for.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
The ADX is well below 25 so I doubt we will have a trade today.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Looks like Buy trade coming in at 10 a.m.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Yep....Hey, I was thinking of a name for the system....How does MADX sound?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Long @ 133.139

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Long 133.18

--- 帖子 #319 ---
MADX-what is M standing for?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I'm in the process of trying to figure out how we can eliminate the break even trades. It's a lot more difficult than you would think.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
M = Michael

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Sounds good

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Would anyone here be willing to help me out by testing some different parameters? By "parameters" I mean trade management parameters. (SL, TP, etc.)

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I take that as a no....

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Michael,

the best way to do it- create EA and we can optimized it and see results for different TP, SL and time periods (like last two or three month)

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I'm not convinced that it's the best way, but it's definitely the easiest. Unfortunately, we don't have an EA yet.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
hello everyboddy

I am very intresting by the nice system..

a question : are you trading the system in demo or in real ?

thank you

bourseok

ps : sorry for my bad english, i am french

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I believe we are all trading it in demo accounts. No apologies needed. Thanks for checking the system out.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
i intend to trade it on mini-account in real..

what do you think about it ?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
To be honest, I am too. I wouldn't risk more than 1% of your account balance. It's definitely up to you but just remember, this is a new system.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Traders! I see divergence on GU.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Thanks for the chart and it looks great. However, this thread is for my GBPJPY system. Please make sure your future posts are relevant.

Thanks,

Michael

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Traders,

Markets have been in wave 4 correction mode all week! I don't think the ADX is going to make the climb above 25 by 10 am.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
ok an what about the trade ot yesterday (+52 pips for me).. ?

do you wait for the break events (100 pips) or do you close the trade or do you wait for 125 pips ?

bourseok

sorry if my questions are stupid ...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Never think that your questions are stupid! People will only put you down to make themselves feel better.

When the trade reaches +100 move the stop to break even. Then you wait for the market to hit your target of +125 or take you out at break even. I'm currently testing to see if we should be moving our stop to +25 after the market reaches +100. I'll let you know how it turns out.

Michael

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Traders,

Looks like we have an ascending wedge and that give me a bullish bias. Thoughts or opinions anyone??

Michael

--- 帖子 #337 ---
rsi >50

adx =24,28 (at 10:35)

custom trend blue

line blue > line red..

wait for a long at 11:00..

--- 帖子 #338 ---
No, if the ADX is not above 25 @ 10am est there is no trade for the day.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
ok thank you even if at 11:00 the adx is>25 but if at 10:00 is not>25  no trade..

is it a rule of your system ?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Yes it is. Make sure you have read page #1 carefully.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
sorry i have not read carefuly

so finish for today

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yes that is correct. No problem. It always takes a while to get used to something new. I would not be opposed to you testing the ADX as a trigger LoL

--- 帖子 #343 ---
If my math is correct, version #2 is up 175 pips in June.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
what about a short at 10:00 ?

rsi<50 (38 at 9 h 35)

adx >25 (26,03 at 9:35)

custom trend ok

red ligne above the blue one..

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Yes, there should be a short trade here in about 20 minutes.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
The ADX is has gone flat.......please watch it carefully. This will be a close one!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
No trade for today.....ADX is moving south of 25

--- 帖子 #348 ---
adx<25 short not ok ?

no trade for today ?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
That is correct. At the close of the last bar the ADX read 23.1583 so we have no trade for today.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
thank you ..

the trade of yesterday will be ok for me (in demo mode)

now i will take all the trade in real mode (micro-lot with risk=1% of my account)

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Sounds good.....have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Interesting method  I just came across it and downloaded the templates. How did you come up with this perfect storm?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Market observations over the last 6 years, taking bits and pieces from other good systems, and a little help from above!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Sorry I'm late! Had a few personal matters to attend to. Was there a long signal?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Yes, long 135.35

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Nice.....

--- 帖子 #357 ---
It was misprint, long 135.35

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I figured that's what you meant.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
No trade today.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
just a quick question, why I can't seem get the red and teal colored line? I've copied the .tpl and .mq4 files into templates and indicators folder respectively. A little help please?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hmmmmm.....you're talking about the custom trend, right? I'm not sure.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
No trade today.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I'm new here, so bare with me

ADX has been above 25 so far for the 3 bars. I am clear on the part that the ADX must be above 25 at the close of the 1st 30 min bar, but must it remain above 25 for all bars?

RSI is now dipping below 50, which would signal a sell.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #364 ---
That's correct.....right now the custom trend is not in agreement so we need to wait and see if it gives a short signal as well.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
No trade at 10 a.m., we have two more bars closings to wait

Michael, if ADX will drop below 25 at closing of 10:30 is it any trade even at 11:00 adx will go up(>25)  and everithing else will line up?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thanks for bringing up the divergence in the custom trend (currently teal). I was going by the ForexOffTrend red and blue lines, which currently the red is above the blue. Do we use those lines for anything?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
If the ADX drops below 25 at the close of the next bar = no trade

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Yes, but everything has to be pointing to a short signal. Right now the red line is above the blue, the rsi is below 50, and ADX above 25. We need the custom trend to turn red in order to enter short.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
All clear now, thanks!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Great! I know it can be a lot to digest but you'll get the hang of it.

Would any of you be interested in just getting a trade signal? For example, I could send out an instant message that tells you to buy, sell, wait, or no trade.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Well.....we are playing the waiting game again

--- 帖子 #372 ---
That's not a bad idea. I am also going to practice myself, though, so I can catch my own fish

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Sounds good.....

For those who are interested in getting the trade signal, I use Yahoo IM. If you don't have it already, go to Yahoo and sign up for an email account. Then send me a pm here on FF with your user name and I'll add you to my friends list.

I'm also working on getting my blog and website off the ground. You should be able to follow me on those over the next couple of weeks/months. There will be additional trading content (videos) and a new, more aggressive, trading system. I'm pretty excited about it.

Michael

--- 帖子 #374 ---
No trade today.....what a slow week!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
What is statistic for the month?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Total June Pips= 75

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Looks like No Trade today because the ADX is well below 25.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
That is correct....working on a post right now. I sent you an IM.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Traders,

The ADX is well below the 25 level. No trade today.

Just a reminder, if you have not signed up for the trade signals via Yahoo IM please send me a PM with you user ID and I will add you to the list ASAP. It is much faster and easier to communicate with you all on IM. There will be additional content available to those who use Yahoo IM such as updates to the system, a new and more aggressive system, videos and much more.

Bay,

You should sign up for the signals man. Would love to chat with you. You've been active in this thread for a while now.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Traders,

One of the greatest attributes of this system is ability for it to say "No Trade". The last 2-3 weeks have been a mess and we have had little to no market exposure.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Good morning traders! Looks like the yen crosses were lower over night as well as yesterday afternoon. Hopefully we can get out of this lame range we have been in. I will be posting a link for a video I made yesterday sometime after 10:00am.

Well it looks like GBPJPY has held that 134.75 level that I mentioned on IM. For now anyway.......

--- 帖子 #401 ---
The RSI is still flirting with the 50 line.....looks like it will be close yet again

--- 帖子 #402 ---
That was the closest trade yet. GBPJPY flashed down just before the close of the bar.....No Trade Today

Did I mention that I'm feeling a bit sick LoL

Why no trade today? ADX > 25, RSI < 50, red line above blue, and custom trend is red

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Not at that specific moment in time......

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hey traders. New parameter update......

Move Stop to +25 instead of break even when the trade hits +100

--- 帖子 #415 ---
WoW.....the price action is lame today!!

Yahoo Instant Messenger members were given access to my website yesterday. If you would like access please join the IM group. Read post #1 for more details or pm me.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
No trade today......I know it's been slow but at least we are not getting stopped out right??

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Good morning traders! No trade for today. Market is really slow and the ADX is well below 25.

I will be sending out a weekly newsletter to those on Yahoo Instant Messenger starting next weekend. If you would like access to the newsletter, videos, etc. make sure you sign up for IM. It's very simple and easy to join the group. Just follow the instructions given in the video on Page #1 of the thread.

This is the slowest trading day in recent memory!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi Michael, I  found your system and since then has done a great and hard work.

I wanted to ask  if the time change we must change the time of sailing by taking  reference to begin. I am currently in Spain (GMT  +1). Comparing  their charts with mine when I see that my Entry is 17:00. Then, in winter  would be 16:00 hours?

And the last question, is implementing the crossing  lines? ie if the blue line is above the red does not go long and vice  versa?

I attach a chart to see if it matches yours.

Thank you very  much for, attention.

http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4070/trend.gif

--- 帖子 #420 ---
within  35 min would have a sell signal, but the blue line is above the red  line, then should not be done, correct?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Give me a few minutes and I'll check that for you.

Michael

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Here is a chart showing why we didn't take the entry. Let me know if you have any other questions and I'll be glad to help you out. Also, you should join the Yahoo Instant Messenger group so you can chat with me at any time, instantly.

Michael

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Trade time in 5 minutes!!!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Traders, sorry for the trade delay. My computer froze on me right as I was giving the signal to IM members. Anyway, you should have gone short. Unfortunately, I never got in......me and technology have a love/hate relationship!

--- 帖子 #425 ---
That was a crazy reaction to consumer confidence.....133 support just broke

--- 帖子 #426 ---
What did you guys get for an entry price?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi michael, thankyou very much for the help. I forgot to tell you that my english is very poor. For that reason I can´t to speak with you in yahoo, sorry...

Now i am in a trade, all conditions have been.

I´ve a question, all the year is the same hour to entry in a market or in winter we have to change the hour in one hour less ? now my entry hour is 17:00, in winter will be 16:00 ?

I show you a picture of the last trade. Iwas entry later because i wasn´t at home.

A greeting and apologize for any inconvenience

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I'm not exactly sure how the time change will affect things. I tested the system using the time we are on now. So I'm not sure what my broker will do this fall when the time changes again. I'll definitely keep you posted on this issue.

I know the language barrier can create a few issues but there are lots of different people that chat with me from all over the world. And I assure you, their english isn't that great either but they are willing to learn so I try to work around it. Give it a try, you might just surprise yourself! Plus you'll get access to all of the videos and such.

Michael

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Traders,

No trade today......move stop on yesterday's trade to +25. I will explain later.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
End of the month and end of the quarter and a short week!!!! Should be fun!!

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I'm working on a few updates to the system as we speak......looks like we will be changing the parameters just a tiny bit.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
For those of you who prefer skype you can add me there if you wish. My ID is fxtakeover

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Daily Trend Method can't show any real signals in the last 24 days which could brought a good profit I think, because there is a range between 130.40 and 136.02 and the range in the last 13 days was between 132.80 135.88. The trend indicators react too slowly for getting a right entry signal.

Trend systems are extremely good when market goes really up or down over several days or weeks.

And when you take a look at 2010.05.06 there was one extremely downward movement from 142.30 to 129.73 in a given day, which has nothing to do with a trend method where prices go in one direction over several days.

Nevertheless nice work here!

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Thank you for the constructive comments. I appreciate it. This is definitely NOT a range trading system so I tried to make it so it would keep us out of the market during those times. The ADX does a fairly good job at this but, as with any system, you will be stopped out and you will have "ugly" trades. Again, thank you for your observations and for the nice compliment. It's posts like yours that make me feel validated!

Michael

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I will try and update you all with the new parameters and such this evening.

Michael

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Traders, no trade today. Our last trade hit it's target yesterday

--- 帖子 #437 ---
hi michael, thankyou very much for response all my questions. Now i am out home for work. In about ten days i´ll come home , and i´ll try to speak with you online with yahoo. i´m following the system with a demo acount. In fact the last trade was closed with 25 pips.

The trade for today will be in one hour ?

you say that don´t will be a trade because the adx in unde the 25 line, is right ?

Greetings.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
dorry, the trade will be when close this bas, but yhe adx is under the 25 line don´t trade ... ?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
That is correct. If the ADX is below 25 there is no trade for the day.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hello traders! No system trade today. ADX is below 25. For a list of the other trades that I'm interested in, join me and the other group members on Yahoo IM or Skype. My ID for both is fxtakeover.

If adx will cross 25 with the bar of 10:30 do we take the trade ?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Sorry for the late reply.....No, If the ADX is below 25 at the close of the 9:30 bar there is no trade for the day.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
What is the position size recommended ?

Thank's in advance for your reply

--- 帖子 #485 ---
If you are going to trade it on a live account, I would say no more than 1% of your account balance.

Traders, working on a parameter update for the method here. I will try to post the update video to page 1 of the thread by the end of today.

Good morning traders! Will today be the day that the markets break their respective ranges?? Your guess is as good as mine.

We still have our open position from Friday.....The new position is considered an add-on. Move the stop from Friday's trade to +35. The new target from Friday's trade is now the same as the target for today's trade. The stop for today's trade is still 100 pips from your entry.

Ex.

I'm short @ 131.815 for today's trade. My target is 125 pips lower @ 130.565

So, the target for both positions is now 130.565

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hey Michael. I'm in short. Do you still think's it's going to drop?  I'm negative 50 pips.

Now down 57 pips.

Sorry for the late reply Mary.....My pc just came down with a virus that I received through IM.......Yes, I was dumb enough to click on it LoL

Anyway, this is a trading system so I try not to carry too much of a bias...but I do agree that today's trade is not looking good. Friday's trade was stopped out at +35

Let me know if you have any further question.

Hi Michael,

I like your idea and patience with entering the trades.

I specially got interested in your thread because of my new found love for ADX.

but...

I am not sure the dragon is the right pair to trade at the moment, since may2010 it has been in a tight range of less than 500 pips. This for a pair with an atr of close to 200. Compare this with EURUSD over the same period which has been in a nice trend. I think using your method would have netted some nice pips.

To use atr for defining trending or ranging market, here is a great technique that can be added to this system, imho

hi

can ur trades be used on a spread betting account as well?

i mainly trade on igindex and fxcm spread betting accounts and not all systems work on that.

thanks

You may take those trades at your own discretion. Just remember to watch the video on the new parameters.

Thanks Michael and everybody in this thread!  I made a EA for this strategy (using fixed sl and tp; close position when reverse signal appears).  I tested it with Aug. ~ Sep. Gbp/Jpy 30m data.  However, the result is not good enough.  Here are my suggestions:

1) "Custom Trend" and "ForexOffTrend_Alert" is not important. You may want to remove the two indicators and simply use ADX's DI+ and DI- to show the trend.

2) Currently ADX>25 is required to open a position; I suggest adding one condition: ADX<35.  When ADX is bigger than 35, the trend has ran for a long way, the risk of reverse becomes bigger.

Attached please see test results and the EA file.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Thank you for all of your hard work! I'll take these comments and suggestions into consideration. Thank you so much for your contribution. Keep us posted on your testing results!

Michael

--- 帖子 #638 ---
By the way, there was no trade today. The ADX dropped below 25.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
i did one more test and found RSI is not necessary either.  also, it is better not to use the 3rd bar.   this way the system will become a "time + ADX" system.

Hi,

Thanks for the EA (shinetrip). I tried it to today and didn't get a trade.  The ADX for me was over 25.  Any reason why I didn't get a trade?  I am also thinking, if the EA could send a message the reason why the trade wasn't made?  It might say what parameter is blocking the trade.

Thanks for the pic! Good analysis, however, this is a mechanical system so I take every trade that it says to take. As far as outlooks are concerned, I always use the daily and 4 hour charts for my analysis with MA's, fibonacci, s/r, and elliott wave.

Hi MichaelLee 8

I have just been reading through your thread, I have a few questions if your don't mind.!

Are you still using the same strategy as posted on page one many months ago?

Do you only trade the one currency with this strategy?

Have often can you get in to a trade?

What is the percentage win ratio?

Thanks

WFX

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Thanks for taking the time to read the thread! I like it when people ask questions. It clarifies the method for everyone who is involved.

1) I officially modified the system on May 27th. You'll find details regarding the modification on page 17 - post 250. I also had additional modifications that came out on June 24(page 28 - post 414) and July 14(page 34 - post 497). The first video on page 1 covers all of the latest and greatest features and parameters of the system. Let me know if you need any help getting set up.

2) Yes, the system only trades GBPJPY. However, I am aware of about a dozen traders that have put their own twist on it and have been successful. Several have mentioned that it works out good with EURUSD but I'm sure they are not using the same parameters that we use with GBPJPY.

3) The system in it's current format trades a maximum of once per day. However, there are quite a few days throughout each month where we don't take a trade because the indicators are not in agreement.

4) To my knowledge the win percentage is between 50-60%. I must admit that I've fallen off of the record keeping as of late and I apologize for that. Thankfully I post all of the trades here on FF. It may take a while to add up the number of trades but we have good forward testing results to look at from May 2010-present.

Thanks again for the questions and your interest in the thread and system. Let me know if I can help you out with anything else.

Hi MichaelLee,

I have been following your strategy for the past month now but I get lost here and there.

For instance: 12 October is a now trade day because of the first bar of the ADX indicator being below 25. Perhaps I am using incorrect trading times. My broker is FXDD and my trading times are at the close of 14:30, 15:00 and 15:30 bars.

Please fill in the blanks if i'm missing something.

Thanks

Hi,

If it is completely mechanical, why not just build an EA to do the trade for you?  Then you could backtest and assess to some degree on the viability of this technique in differing market conditions?

I saw you forum that you always unable to trade due to your time trading. I have some advice for you.

If you want to trade 30min chart, I strongly suggest you to start trading from 6:00 GMT to 14:00GMT

especially on 7:00 GMT there usually have more opportunity on some of the currency pairs not only GBP/JPY.

In this chart is show that it start the trade from 9:00. 9:00 is my broker time (+3 GMT) which mean if you trade at 6:00 GMT, you have have profit on 30M

Hi Michael,

I understand the rule about the time at which ADX is above 25.  Is this condition critical for the overall profitability of the strategy, or is it an enhancement?  Would it be totally wrong to simply use the ADX value at the time all other parameters are satisfied?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Good question

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Sandy,

Sorry about the delayed response. I just got the email notification of a new post. The ADX is used to keep us out of range bound markets. When GBPJPY is consolidating the ADX tends to be below the 25 level. Of course with any system, there will be times of chop that are unavoidable. So it's not perfect.

I am not in any way opposed to using the ADX as you suggested previously. In fact, Bob and I had a lengthy conversation this morning about how to improve the method. He had an idea regarding the London Gold Fix and I am looking into the higher time frames for trading possibilities there. So, in short, feel free to tweek the method or change parts of it outright. The only thing I ask is that you report back here if you have any positive developments so all of the members can see the progress.

Thanks,

Michael

Michael thanks for this interesting system will study it and see if a mechanical backtest will give good results.

Do you think this system would have worked two years ago or is it an adaption for the current market?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Hey Saidar,

Thanks for joining up with us and your interest in the method here. I'm sure that the approach had different results two years ago when compared to 2010. The later half of 2010 was fairly rough for gbpjpy as a currency pair. Volatility decreased significantly and it was caught in a small range for weeks, if not months. I'm currently researching a few different things including higher time frames and the implementation of a more dynamic target (take profit). Any ideas or testing that you can bring to the table would be much appreciated!

Michael

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Yes that is usually the problem with any mechanical system, once the market changes the rules change.

Your idea to only trade 3 30min bars a day is excellent, backtests over 10 years always prefers one hour a day where propabilities are very high compared to the rest of the day.

For a more dynamic take profit I would suggest you look into donchian channels.

What you can do is use the top or bottom area of the channel, or use the channel for a fibo retracement and use one of the levels for a TP, or all of the levels to close a part of the order.

Bollinger bands may also work but I prefer donchian channels as they are real SR areas

Hey guys, I've just found this system and I consider it a great idea (the time really fits me). Ok, now questions xD

First question for Michael - in third post you wrote 9.30, 10, 10.30 EST. If i recall correctly EST is GMT -5, so 9.30 EST is 14.30 GMT, right? You use forex.com broker, I thought it uses GMT time, but your first bar stars at 13.30...I believe you get, what I mean

And second question - In winter New York open hour is 8:00 EST, but in summer (daylight saving) it is 8:00 EDT (EST +1 I believe). This system is basing on New York opening hours (if I've got it right) so times of our 3 bars should change... Well, maybe I misunderstood everything, but better to ask the way than go astray ;D

So keep on, guys!!! You do great job and you can count on me...

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Thanks for taking the time to look into the method. The time has always been an issue so don't feel bad for asking. It's tough to figure out at first. The three bars that we are concerned with are:

The bar that opens at 9:30am and closes at 10:00am

The bar that opens at 10:00am and closes at 10:30am

The bar that opens at 10:30am and closes at 11:00am

The times that are listed are according to the time in New York City. Daylight savings time only affects things in terms of GMT because, to my knowledge, GMT never changes.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Michael

P.S. I used to be with forex.com but I moved over to FXCM.

Hey Michael, the ATR is good, but try to use support/resistance areas for a stop loss (few pips above), and modify the take profit so that the risk to reward ratio stays the same.

I've been very busy this week, will develop an EA for this system soon so that we can do some mechanical backtesting.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Using s/r for stop loss levels turns it into a discretionary system.........unless there is an automatic way to define s/r......

--- 帖子 #819 ---
yes you are completely right and we do not want it to be a discretionary system.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Use the highest high and lowest low of a certain time period, good way to define SR.  Donchian channel is a good indicator for this.

Just an idea you don't have to use it

--- 帖子 #821 ---
No problem with the idea.....just wondering how you were going to incorporate it into an EA's code.....fractals maybe??

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Nah it's easy hehe no problem.  Basic EA finished based on your first rules with a take profit of 100 and stop loss of 120, see below for backtest results (past 2 years).

I did not use the offtrend indicator as I'm not sure what to use it for ? ?

Your strategy works, with some good money and trade management this strategy is definitely a winner.  Not sure what the markets holds for the future but for now it will work if managed correctly.

As you can see it fails in a ranging market, and builds in a trending market.

I really like this strategy will write an advanced EA maybe we can do this on auto pilot

--- 帖子 #823 ---
nice..thanks..

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Thanks for the hard work you are putting in! I really appreciate it and I'm sure others do as well....So if I'm understanding you correctly, you used the very first version of the method for the EA? The settings were TP=125 and SL=100 move the stop to +25 when the trade reaches +100.

Thanks Again,

Michael

--- 帖子 #825 ---
I did not use the breakeven method, from my experience over a long period a breakeven strategy does not really improve your balance but it does reduce drawdowns.

Will add it soon

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Ok, let me explain this.  Many people don't get it, but backtests never lie.

Moving the stop loss IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

In mathematical terms you are messing with the statistics.  Yes some trades will benefit, but other trades will suffer from this action.  At the end of the day you are running in a circle not really getting anywhere.

The guy who keeps his stop loss will more or less have the same balance as the guy who changes his stop loss over a long period of say a year.

I know this is a diffcult concept to grasp, but I have done numerous tests on this issue and it always gives me the same answer.

If you REALLY want to change your stop loss, modify it after the break of a resistance area, and move with the resistance (fractals or donchian channel etc).  Using a set number of pips won't work.

What is more important is to look for patterns like wedges, triangles, and major support and resistance areas.  If a trade is in danger close it don't move the stop loss.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
GBPJPY DAILY TREND METHOD: Wait

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Not difficult to grasp at all.....just thinking that there maybe be a better way to control risk than the original......don't get me wrong....I'm still trading with the old parameters, just curious. As far as patterns and the like are concerned, I agree. However, if one started to intervene on trades it could have the same affect as adjusting the stop. Just my thoughts.....

Again, thanks for the work on the EA....I'll trust your judgment and recommendations on it...

Hi Dear Michael,

Thank you for sharing your wonderful strategy which I would like to learn and apply with.

At the moment, I saw the off trend blue and red lines are at the same value above the 3 bars( while other conditions are met for a LONG trade)..Is it  the reason you say WAIT?

I spoke with a trader from Canada this morning on Skype. We hadn't spoken in quite some time (glad he is ok) and he let me know that he is having GREAT success with this method on GBPAUD! He said that he starts looking 30 minutes before we do with GBPJPY and his parameters are slightly different as well. 135 pips for the target, -100 pips for the stop, and move the stop to +35 when the trade gets up +100 pips.

We are still working on the EA for those of you that might be interested in that development. It is coming along nicely and I'm pleased with the results so far. However, we are going to continue to test it in private instead of releasing it on the forum. There are obvious reasons for this. Thank you for understanding.

Thanks again to all of you who have contributed and stuck with the method! I really appreciate you time and efforts! (Bob, Franco, Michael K, Ron)

Stop hit at +32 if you are using the ATR parameters

Still in our last trade......if you were using the ATR parameters you would have been out with around 30 pips on Friday......I'm down about 20 right now with the old parameters.....

Hello Micheal,

at first, I'm new on this board and i have to say this site very interesting. Especially your thread! =)

But i have a problem, my english is not the best,so that I cant understand any comment in this thread. For that reason my following question you definitely answered, but perhaps you can do it again for me!

What is the custom trend? How can I determinate it on my charting tool? What are the settings?

By the way, i dont use the metatrader4!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Gbpjpy daily trend method: Wait

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Sorry about this everyone but I didn't realize that the ADX is under 25.......meaning there will not be a trade today.....

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Thanks for following along. The custom trend is also known as the "slope direction line". To my knowledge it is a derivative of typical moving averages. Sign up for a demo account with any broker that offers mt4 to see how it functions. I use it's default settings.

Hey there,

I picked these particular bars because they represent the "London Fix". The idea is that we will often see direction for the rest of the day established between 10:00 am and 11:00 am EST. Now this isn't perfect by any means but I'm sure you get what I'm saying.

I know a few traders that use it on GBPAUD and GBPCHF. But the times they trade are different than the time for GBPJPY. On a side note, the custom trend indicator is the same as the "slope direction line" indicator. Just a different name....

At the close of the third candle RSI was below 50 and ADX below 25 and custom trend was red.

At the close of it we were supposed to sell gbp yen at around 138.95.

That what I did as my first deal with this system.

Am I right?

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Gbpjpy daily trend method: No trade today.....adx is below 25

If the ADX is below the 25 level at the close of the first bar there is no trade regardless of what happens afterward. That being said, if you would like to trade it that way and put your own "spin" on the method that is fine. I encourage people to try different things with it.

Michael

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Michael have you tried using the trend of a lower TF. Rather then a daily, with this method.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Hey bud,

The trades are taken from the 30 minute time frame. I know the title of the thread can be a bit misleading. I just didn't know what to call it to be honest with you LoL. There are a few traders that have mentioned to me that they are using it in conjunction with their own approach on the 4 hour and Daily. I've looked into it a little bit myself but haven't ever done anything with those time frames.

Michael

--- 帖子 #969 ---
........Thanks for all your hard work and effort you have put into this method, however there are a few things not quite clear to me:

1. Generally RSI is set on the CLOSE, but this is not mention in post 1, can you please confirm?

2. There are 4 Indicators but only 3 parameters for both BUY and SELL in post 2 and 3; what is the function of the Forex Off Trend Indicator?

I will post a chart shortly as I want to do a time and price check with your broker, regards, John

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Here is my chart, can you please confirm that the time and price is correct for Friday, 4/8/2011?

Also, you say no trade because the ADX is below 25 but I have it above, please check.

No mention of the Custom Trend or Slope, I'm showing green so that would also be no trade, correct? (assuming my trade time zone is set right)

Do you ever take notice of the ADX +D and -D readings? I don't see it on the charts I have seen so far; I believe you are missing out the great power of the ADX !!!

Seems to me that the RSI setting need to be made quicker, maybe 10 or so, to make it a bit more responsive?

Also, the Slope Indicator seems to be way behind the price action, see the chart, have you tried different settings?

I know some of this may already be discussed, I am still reading the thread; weekend soon, so hopefully you have some spare time for this, many thanks, John

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Gbpjpy daily trend method: No trade today....adx is below 25

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Yes, the RSI is set to CLOSE. We are using the forex off trend cross as more of a short term confirmation. However, the blue line of that indicator "repaints" so I decided to use a 5 ema crossing with the red line instead....It's kind of weird how the blue line repaints but the red line doesn't....

--- 帖子 #973 ---
1) I can confirm those prices. They are almost identical to mine.

2) Brokers are different. I use FXCM so my ADX readings might be different than yours. If your ADX is above 25 and you like the direction of the trade, feel free to take it.

3) If the ADX is below 25, the custom trend (slope line) is not relevant. However, according to the ORIGINAL METHOD and YOUR CHART that is a buy signal. I hope I didn't just confuse you .

4) I never use the +D or -D lines. That is not to say that they cannot be used. I encourage everyone to tweak and adjust anything and everything as they see fit. The ADX line is used as a trend filter. It isn't perfect but it tends to keep us out of a lot of range bound PA.

5) The RSI period of 20 is just a favorite of mine. I promise I wont be offended if you change it.

6) I haven't really experimented with the settings on the custom trend (slope line). I didn't see a reason to change it.

Thanks for following along and for asking questions. They add clarity and help out others who are viewing the thread. Let me know if you have any other questions or comments.

GBPJPY DAILY TREND METHOD: NO TRADE TODAY.....Indicators are mixed

I studied this thread few days ago and felt it has a winning edge and decided to give it some intensive research.   Like any other thread or systems it has ups and downs and work extremely well in some markets but does not perform well in other markets. Mainly most systems requires volatility.   So I made manual back tests with various parameters and various currency pairs.    One of my main purposes was to adjuste it in a way to perform and survive all kinds of markets and also to assign a low stop loss to open positions.  For the lowest the stop loss the greater the profits.  For the size of open positions are proportional to the risk factor assigned to each position which is often 1%.
i.e. a  40 pips gained on a stop loss of 30 is equivalent to 80 pips gained on a stop of 60 and 120 pips on a stop of 90.   So below are my finding:

Currency euro/Yen.    Take profit: 72 pips.  Stop loss 30 pips.    move to Break even at 32 pip.
I made some adjustment and I applied it to USA opening as well as Europe opening.  i.e.  two possible entries per day.
If at  USA opening at 9:30 EST time all requirements are met (RSI, ADX CUTOM TREND) enter position and if not do not enter.  That is all, a more simpl entry rule.  Enter at 9:30.
Do the same things for UK opening.

Here are the results which I checked four times manually:
2011:    Jan:  +190     Feb:     -14        Mar:  +61
2010:   Dec   +441     Nov:   +440      Oct: + 22        Sept:  -265    Aug:  +139
July:  +34       June:  +124      May:  +480     April:  +606

Total of last 12 month = + 2258 pips  a monthly average of: + 188 pip.
N.B. Again + 188 pips on a 30 pip stop loss only.  This would be more than 3 times if the stop was 100.
If someone asks I will include detailed excel sheet..
I hope I stayed faithful to the core and spirit of this thread.

I have another questions on exit point no 2:

"2) If, on the following morning, you receive a signal in the opposite direction."

The opposite signal meaning all signals must be met?

say we are on long trade, the opposite signal include RSI AND ADX AND ForeOffTernd AND Counter Trend? or only either one of them show opposite signal?

Thanks

Correct, all parameters must be met. For example, let's say that we are in a short trade but the market remained close to our entry price. Then on the following morning we get a signal for a long trade. We would then close our short trade and open a long position.

hello Michael,

i have been looking at your method over past couple of days. havent finished reading entire thread to be honest but will do within next few days.

i installed your system on alpari uk demo and the MT4 from forex.com, however I have trouble backtesting this system because the red line can only be seen for few weeks back in the history. how do you get so much data in the history with a red line?

as per `modified system` in your excel sheet from page 1: do you move SL to +25 or +35 once you are up 100 pips?

have a good evening

Hi Michael,

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
According to video on page 1 you move sl to +25 after you are up 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
hi hankt

if i am not wrong Michael mentioned 35 in one video and 25 in the other

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Yeah, those parameters have changed......it is now +35 when you are up 90 pips.....I believe I answered your other questions on Skype....Let me know...

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Thanks for checking it out Tonny! You can change the number of bars that show the red line in the indicator properties window....I believe it is the first setting listed (Count Bars). Just change it to some high number. I've found that it tends to bog your platform down if you have too many bars showing the red line so I did my testing offline. It makes a world of difference...

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Yes, if the indicators are mixed and we have an open trade, we leave the trade open.

I'll be around to give out the trade signals next week but won't be online for long......

TO: everyone asking about daily progress report, very easy to calculate when the entry is known, as per 1st post, Stop Loss = 100, Take Profit = 125

So, SL is 132.525 and TP is 130.275, I am making the assumption that you are actually looking at charts while following this method, so just draw 3 lines when there is a trade on, then look at the chart to see the position of the trade

GO Markets showing a low of 130.274 so congratulation to Michael Lee

what's the prev trade status 12/May/2011 ? when are we supposed to close it? should be closed right before we open this trade on 24 May 2011?

wtjs1971 = posted earlier

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
The entry from that trade was at 131.525 if I remember correctly. If you are still in it, you forgot to do two things.

1) Place a 100 pip stop

2) Move the stop to +35 when the trade gets to +90

The specific trade that you are inquiring about was taken out at +35. Please refer to post #1045 on page 70.

Thanks for your participation,

Michael

may  know why have you chose this pair gbpjpy and not any other currency pair?

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
Sure. I always found gbpjpy a difficult pair to trade in my discretionary trading but I loved the volatility. So I set out to "conquer" it by utilizing a more mechanical approach. That's really the only reason why I chose gbpjpy over the other pairs.

Michael

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Thanks michael. I may have no time to monitor changing stop loss.

is there away (ie using EA) to move the stop loss once it hits +90 (is it 90 not 100? I remember reading somehwere in this thread it was mentioned 100)

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
The first video on post #1 has the details of the stop movement.....Post #1 also contains the Multi Purpose Trade Mananger EA.....

I wanted to ask why you do it from 9 am. For the night is already a tendency to rise. And my observation is always a tendency to go contrary to 9 pm. a few pips. For example,  40 pips or more.

Linas,

If you want to try and use it at a different time that's completely fine. If you look back through the thread you'll see that I've constantly encouraged people to try different things and do what's best for them.

Just thought I would let you all know that I'll probably be away from the trading room, Yahoo IM, the forum, and the gbpjpy daily trend method signals for 2-4 weeks starting on Monday June 27th. I'll be helping a friend on a project at a Merck facility in Cleveland, TN.

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
Is really profitable?

MM is a very suspicious part...

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Suspicious?

Stop= 100 pips

Target= 125 pips

Jumping Stop= move stop to +35 when the trade gets to +90

I'm sorry if those parameters don't suit you or your style of trading. Feel free to change them around to fit your needs. If that's not something you are interested in then this thread is probably not for you.
