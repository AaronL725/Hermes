So, I figured I'd take some time to outline my basic pivot point trading method guidelines, which is what I use on a daily basis to take advantage of intraday price swings between pivot points. For several months, I have posted about this method on DailyFx's Trading Journal forum. Originally, the intent of my journal was to evaluate and test the Mirror Trader Platform's "free" automated strategies to see whether a method of choosing and using the strategies could be developed that would be profitable, save me time, and, quite honestly, whether they were worth anything, given the fact that they were "free." Much to my chagrin, I was unable to be consistently successful using the suite of strategies they have available, having been frequently aggravated by some of the trading decisions made by the strategies I'd set up to run. To be completely fair, however, I virtually abandoned trading using the Mirror Trading strategies within a month of carefully picking, implementing, and then managing the chosen strategies, primarily due to the fact that (1) I am a control freak; (2) virtually learned nothing of value looking at the trades the strategies took, since their methodology was not transparent and was not always readily apparent from looking at the charts; and (3) I was at a loss as to why certain strategies would pass on a 50 pip gain, only to let a trade slip into and stop out in the red, eventually ascertaining that these strategies were -- to use a baseball analogy -- batting for the wall when all I wanted to do was hit well placed ground balls to get to first base. I simply am not the kind of trader who can tolerate or wait for a strategist to strike it big on one 2-1 risk/reward plus trade to offset their slow torture of my equity in the mean time, especially in these low volatility markets where one has to inevitably settle for less. I also think that, as a trading community, Forex Factory tends to be a little bit more active than DailyFx, since I imagine that the vast majority of users there are due to their being associated with one broker, FXCM , while here there are folks you use a wide number of brokers, so I figured I'd start a thread here instead. In any event, ... As with any method, I tweak these rules or guidelines from from time to time or exercise common sense and discretion with individual trades. I know that this method may violate several cardinal rules. However, the method tells me when to enter; when to exit; can be done with a minimum of time before the New York and Asian sessions; gets me in and out of trades in fairly short order; and frees me from paralysis by analysis. I refer to the method as "dollar cost averaging," since, in essence, you are buying a pair with a lot size that remains constant intra-trade for the cost of that fixed size lot at the time it is purchased. Does it, for example, on occasion have large intratrade drawdowns? Certainly. Do you add positions to what traditional traders would label "bad" trades? Yes. Is failing to use stop losses crazy? Yes, to some, it is insanity; however, one of the hallmarks of the system is the virtually miniscule position sizes as compared to what I've seen traders using. Naturally, if you're going to use 10 x equity (10%) of your margin per leg of the trade, you're going to quickly run into trouble with doing things this way, and you'd best move along. But I assume you, like me, are also tired of having your trades stopped out, only to have price move in the direction of your original trade and then to your TP in short order. Again, I'm not batting for the wall; I'm trying to make singles ... . Stops get in the way of the relatively small movements I want to take advantage of intraday and jack up an otherwise good trading choice when the only thing that is lacking is the preciseness of my timing as to entry. In a nutshell: The basic set-up is a 1H chart with the following indicators: Fib Retracement Pivot Points (Daily) and 200 SMA. You can also use an RSI, other MA's or indicators to assist you in your decision-making process as to the direction your trade should take. If you platform doesn't have Fib Retracement Pivot Points, you can also use Classic or Camarilla pivot points as guidelines for entries and TP's. Small lot entries/small lot positions: .25-.5 times equity for each entry. For example, if you have $10,000 worth of equity, your lot sizes should be between 2 and 5K for each entry. Try to keep in mind that you may want to add to a given position if the TP is not hit immediately and where the set-up remains valid. Where possible, keep the total size of any position to &lt;1 times equity. What is of primary importance to me is that, under no circumstances do I want to get near having a margin call, with the destructive result being that the system shuts down positions. You may be comfortable with larger positions; this size suits me, at least for now. My routine is to first check what's on tap on the econ calendar, focusing primarily on medium or high level reports; generally, low level reports don't move the market much. I generally want to avoid pairs that are most likely to be affected by a given report. I then start scrolling through the charts shortly after the New York close (as this is when "new" daily pivot points are formed), generally looking for 200 SMA's with fairly flat aspects, price action that moves back and forth across the SMA, or price that is hugging the SMA. I may also look at how the RSI is behaving in attempt to validate the direction I think I should go. Additionally, I will also just look at price action for swing highs and lows and see how well those levels have been respected. In other words, I am generally looking for pairs that are range-bound, at least for the short term. Additionally, I will use multi-time frame analysis to examine how the pair's price is doing with respect to the 200 period MA. Generally speaking, if price is below the 200 SMA on the 1 and 6H time frames, I will look to fashion an entry order to sell; if it is above, I look to fashion a buy. Also, I may look at even higher time frames (8H, Daily) to see if the pair is in a discernible range, short term or otherwise. Naturally, if it is ranging, but in a wider range, I may opt to wait until price moves more to the top or bottom of the range to consider a trade. For buys: entry order at .236, TP at .764. For sells, entry at .764, TP and .236. I virtually never set an SL, unless it is ensure profit or avoid loss after price has moved into profit. Where a position opens and the TP is not reached by the close of the following day, reset the TP to the new levels established by the newly formed pivot points and, assuming the set-up is still valid, create appropriate entry orders to add to the position in the direction of the original trade if it makes sense (again, sells at the .764, buys at the .236). If the resetting of a TP to the new pivot point would result in a loss, I generally set the TP to at least a 10 pip gain. If the order for the additional leg executes, adjust the TP to the greater of the appropriate pivot point or 10 pips, whichever is greater. Use common sense to avoid situations such as doubling up on currencies or closely correlated pairs, onerous swaps that will cut into your profit, and pairs that just aren't worth wading into due to the narrow range in which they're trading. For example: (1) if you've got one Yen long cross, leave it at that. There is little point going long with CHF/JPY and EUR/JPY; they're basically the same thing. Doing that can amplify your gains, but can set you up for multiple "dog" trades that you have to gracefully exit, rather than just one. Look for other set-up's with other currencies. They're virtually always out there. (2) Right now NZD short has an onerous swap. Since you can't be absolutely certain that you'll be able to exit that before incurring a negative swap, it is best to avoid NZD shorts for the time being. Look for NZD long set-up's going forward. (3) There are several currency pairs whose movement is glacial and not worth bothering with. For example, and against my better judgment, I entered into a EUR/CHF trade earlier today that only had a potential range between the .736 and .234 of less than five pips. The pair ran through my range, and I gained some pips (2.7 to be exact), but really, are you that desperate? (well, I guess I was, because I took the trade). * * * I would note that I frequently violate a couple common rules regarding risk management and risk/reward ratio with this method. First of all, I almost always do not apply stops. However, the lot sizes are so small that I would have to endure a 200 pip spike for me to begin to feel the pain. Use common sense; if you've added to a position thinking that your set-up is still valid and your position is approaching 1 times equity, place some kind of reasonable stop if that is what you need not to have a heart attack. Secondly, while the risk-reward ratio sometimes starts out pretty good (from .236 to .764 is a pretty good gain with most pairs), this ratio will narrow if the pivot box contracts due to less volatility or the pair moves against you. Again, though, you're looking for singles; not home runs. You may, on some occasions, want to let certain trades run. If that is the case, however, you want to at least consider taking some of the meat off the table at the .764, 1, or 1.272 (in the case of a buy), and placing a stop in such a way that you are trading with house money at that point. As with all things, some patience is required. In my case, I examine the charts, place the entry orders, and then try not to look at the charts again until the following morning or evening. The movement of certain pairs, after all, can be maddening in the short-term either because they're moving at a glacial pace (EUR/CHF) or because they seem to be bouncing all over the place (GBP/JPY). There's no point in staring at the screen; it won't help the price move in the direction you want. Believe me, I've tried. Moreover, quite frequently, you may have to hold a position longer than you'd like. Ideally, you'd like to be out of positions by the weekend so that you can sit back and relax without having to think about that "dog" trade you made that is weighing you down, but that's not always possible. Sometimes, you may have wait for the right moments to add a leg or legs to the position to allow you to exit the net position profitably; don't panic, pairs are in ranges 70% of the time and sometimes all it takes to be successful with a net position is time and for the pair to fall back into a range or begin consolidating. * * * Lastly, it is unfortunate that I am a Mac user and don't use Metatrader, which I have found to be unstable. Consequently, I can't set up a Trade Explorer (at least right now, the techies here have told me), which would save me tons of time. I will try to post examples of trades and results here on a regular basis. I am not here to pump a system or to advocate a particular way of doing things. This is just an idea you can look at and consider, along with the apparent gajillion other ideas posted out there on the web. Also, this is not the only tool I use in my toolbox; there are plenty of trade set-up's out there that I look at that involve somewhat intricate charting and examining the precise point at which I am going to consider a buy or sell and that may require several weeks of waiting for the set-up's to develop. This is just what I use on a day-to-day basis. Regardless of whatever system you use, happy trading! (Or, at least, heart attack free trading). Mike, The ZebraSquirl

Here's an example of an open position I took early today, an AUD/CHF long, price for which has going back and forth across the 200 hour MA for at least a few days now and appears to be (somewhat sloppily) in a range.

Early New York Session EUR/USD Short TP hit for small profit: Attached Image (click to enlarge) EUR/JPY Short TP hit for entire span from .764 to .236: Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUD/CHF Long TP hit for the entire span from the .236 to the .764: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The EUR/USD short entry order that was intended to add to the existing short that hit TP is deleted. The USD/CHF long entry order is deleted; price is now outside the .764, and I don't think it will retrace back to the .236 before the New York close. The GBP/USD short entry order executed. The long-term (non-pivot point based) GBP/AUD short order executed. Current Open Positions GBP/USD Short at 1.71258/TP 1.70888 GBP/AUD Short at 1.82948/TP 1.81180 Pivot Point Based Entry Orders None at this time. Long-Term GTC Non-Pivot Point Based Entry Orders EUR/AUD short at 1.48635 GBP/NZD short at 1.98507 EUR/NZD short at 1.61901 Usable Margin: 98.11% Usable Maintenance Margin: 96.21% Current Position/Leg Size .5 x equity/.5% Margin Other Notes Obviously I could have stayed in the EUR/USD and NZD/USD shorts longer and captured more pippage. This is just how it works out sometimes. Frankly, I was just happy to get out of the NZD/USD short with a net profit on the position before I incurred another swap, which had already sucked about five pips out of the trade. At the end of the New York session, I'll consider adding entry orders to the open positions, as well as look at other pairs to dive back into. I am currently in GBP (2x), AUD (1x), and USD (1x), so I'll want to look at wading back into EUR, JPY, and possibly CAD, although CAD has some settling down to do after last week's movement. I consider the GBP/AUD short a long-term play; you can see I'm looking at trying to capture over 150 pips there, at least the way the order is fashioned now. With that particular position, I'll look at adding positions based up longer-term Fib levels. You can see, for example, that the 1.8375 is an important level to watch going forward and may be another place to consider adding a position, depending upon how the "big picture" looks: Attached Image (click to enlarge) See you at the end of the New York sesh!

So basically you are working with micro lots (10c per pip) on a 10k account, right?

Post New York Close My GBP/USD short did not hits its target price, so I will move the TP for the position up to the new .236 and will fashion an entry order to add to the position, selling at the .764 should price reach that level, as I think that the short is still good. Rather, coincidentally, the price associated with the .236 has not changed substantially, so I will leave it alone as the TP. As previously noted, the GBP/AUD short is a long-term position. I have looked at that chart and price is currently around break even. I am going to wait on fashioning an entry order to add to the position to see if the pair breaks higher or if it's going to retrace its advance, which may take a couple of days to develop. Moving on to consider my other options for pairs to add into the mix, my choices appear somewhat limited. I am in GBP (2x), AUD (1x), and USD (1x). I don't want to double up too much on any one currency, so I think the focus should be on EUR, JPY, and possibly CAD. I am reluctant to wade into NZD short, so the kiwi is off the table, since I want to wait for my long-term NZD pair set-up's to occur instead (since they would be NZD long). I am also temporarily turned off by recent impulsive CAD movement and would prefer to wait until that currency settles a bit directionally before visiting it again. So, it seems like I should revisit last night's plays of short EUR/USD, short EUR/JPY, and possibly long AUD/CHF (which is basically the inverse of EUR/AUD short). Out of those three, neither EUR/USD nor EUR/JPY looks particularly promising. Prices at the end of the New York close are both below the .236, meaning that they would have to retrace all the way to the .764 before my short would execute; the same would go for AUD/CHF, only it is currently above the .764, so it would have to retrace all the way to the .236 before the long would execute. I did consider a EUR/AUD short set-up, but that is another pair that has retraced below the .236. As a last resort, I will look at USD/JPY and AUD/JPY (long only due to swap). Although there is some equivocation as to direction between shorter and longer time frames with repsect to USD/JPY, I think it is in somewhat of a longer term range, that the price it is currently hovering around is the bottom of that range, and that it might be a fairly good place to go long (although lower toward 101.25 would be better). AUD/JPY looks like it is in a bit of short-term consolidation (or at the very least, performing within a tighter range) than USD/JPY. I can do one of two things here, do an OCO order for these or go long with both, and I think I'm going to choose the later, opting to go long with both of these in the event they hit their respective .236's, with their TP's being at the .764. This will result in my being in GBP (2x), USD (2x), JPY (2x), and AUD (2x), assuming the USD/JPY and AUD/JPY longs execute. Current Open Positions GBP/USD Short at 1.71258/TP 1.70888 (Unchanged) GBP/AUD Short at 1.82948/TP 1.81180 (Unchanged) Pivot Point Based Entry Orders GBP/USD Day Entry Order to Short at 1.71594/TP 1.70888(Addition to Current Position) USD/JPY Day Entry Order to Buy at 101.522/TP 101.688 AUD/JPY Day Entry Order to Buy at 95.187/TP 95.492 Long-Term GTC Non-Pivot Point Based Entry Orders EUR/AUD short at 1.48635 GBP/NZD short at 1.98507 EUR/NZD short at 1.61901 Usable Margin: 98.11% Usable Maintenance Margin: 96.21% Current Position/Leg Size .5 x equity/.5% Margin Other Notes You can see that I have used very little of my margin. I will naturally consider increasing the leg size to greater than .5 x equity as I cycle through a couple of weeks of trades with that size. I recently increased the size from .375 times equity to .5, so I naturally want to see how that size feels in terms of intratrade drawdowns and such.

Do you at any point decide it is time to exit a trade at a loss? Since you began trading your method, have you closed any trades at a loss? And by closing at a loss, I mean closing the entire position for a loss, not losing on one or two entries of a multi-entry position. I have tried similar strategies in the past, but ultimately found that one loss, however one decides to take it, wiped out all of any gains made previously. Nonetheless, it was nice winning 99% of the time for weeks and months on end; perhaps I was doing something wrong. Thanks -

Exactly. My lot sizes are somewhat ridiculously small (this week, I just bumped it up from 3k to 4k per leg of the trade). I used to trade primarily equities, so moving over to forex is somewhat of an adjustment. I figured I would start out small in terms of lot size and then increase it once I became comfortable with how the intratrade drawdowns were going and saw how positions that I could tolerate at the same time using a particular lot size. It's looking right now that 5 pairs max is a good rule of thumb, especially if you make a concerted effort to avoid weighting the open trades toward a singular currency. That's why I look at what I've got open and what's not represented in that mix and choose to focus on unrepresented currencies for considering trades. But, in keeping stats on the Usable Margin/Usable Maintenance Margin percentages I'm using, it's probably safe to assume that the leg size could be more like 1% than the .5% I'm currently at, which is not particularly aggressive.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
When I first started doing things this way, I closed a number of them out for losses on the net position. I attribute that primarily to a lack of experience, impatience, and periodic panic as to where a trade was going. Point in fact, I almost closed out that NZD/USD short position for a loss on that net position, just because the swap was sucking so hard at the limited gains I wanted to achieve. However, a little patience (and confidence that my short was good) paid off. The thing I like to emphasize with anything like this is that you need to assume that you will need to take multiple positions in a pair in order to make the net position profitable. And that is why the leg size is intentionally small. Say, for example, that you need to take 5 positions over time in a pair in order to make it net profitable (which I have had to do on occasion; this is, in fact, the max number of positions I have taken in a pair before realizing a net gain of some kind). Keeping the leg size small allows you to do this without, at the same time, committing a large percentage of your margin to do so and without panicking intratrade about the drawdown. This is why using a more ample lot size (like 5 x equity or 5% per leg) would probably eventually kill my equity. In the alternative, you can look at it from the perspective that you should keep the leg sizes small enough so that your entire position with this kind of system is not more than what you'd risk on a trade using traditional methodologies and rules of thumb (no more than 1% per open trade; no more than 10% for all open trades). Also, examining closely as to whether you should add to the position at a particular point is critical. You don't just want to mechanically add to the position; you want to make sure the set-up is still valid or, if you've made a mistake with the initial entry, add when it is most advantageous to do so. This might require you to be in the trade longer than you'd like. For example, if the initial leg executes, but fails to hit the TP the first day, and then you add to the position at the appropriate pivot point the second day (which executes) and price still doesn't hit your TP, then you should probably step back from the trade, reevaluate the direction, and wait for a more advantageous entry point, which may not occur until the following day or the day after that or even the day after that. This may require you to dig other tools out of your tool box: is it in a channel? is it moving to a new range? is there a longer-term S/R level in play? is it breaking out? Here's a good example of that: the entry of the first leg of the GBP/NZD trade below was awful and it moved against me -- significantly. I didn't close it out. I waited. And waited. And waited far longer than I wanted to for price to top out before adding to the position, ultimately realizing a fairly good gain on the net position: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Certainly, the traditional trader would think that this is a stupid way of doing things. Why not just let the first leg stop out and then wait for a better entry point? Well, because if there's anything I am particularly bad at, it is figuring out a good point to make a good entry (as is obvious from the above example) and a good point to exit, especially if a trade goes against me. Do you panic and bail now at market? Or do you wait and attempt to bail at a better price? Ugh. Moreover, the other, related shortcoming I have is that my difficulty in setting a stop and a target price and just leaving them alone once the trade has executed. That being said, I've only starting piddling around with doing things this way since the beginning of May (which I don't think is statistically significant). Only time will tell ... . Also, we're in a particularly low volatility market. What will happen when things get a little more jumpy?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Also, the GBP/NZD example above is a stark example of one of the pairs that can move violently and is more amenable to traditional, long-term trade set-up's that will take greater advantage of this pair's movement. A system of this nature, which takes advantage of the fact that pairs are in ranges 70% of the time, is best confined to less volatile pairs (although I have, from time to time, inadvisably traded the "widow-maker" (GBP/JPY) with it as well), which I will avoid going forward. I would say that EUR/NZD is another one of those pairs that I won't trade this way; this is why I have a traditional short from a particular long-term Fib level for this pair and for GBP/NZD.

Asian Sesh My AUD longs (AUD/JPY (which executed earlier) and GBP/AUD) are looking a bit tattered ... . That's okay; I'm a patient guy. Also, it appears that a number of others have attempted this method in the past (see "Similar Threads" on the left sidebar). It appears that these threads are all defunct and haven't posted in ages. I can only assume that these traders failed or are millionaires living on their own private island; unfortunately, it is most likely the former. See you at the beginning of the New York; GBP promises to be frisky with upcoming employment data ... .

Moved TP on GBP/AUD short to 1.82118 (the .236 pivot point). This was to be a long-term non-pivot point based system trade, although I would welcome the pips if I could hit this particular TP (&gt;80 pips). I was frankly surprised that the entry order executed, since I originally thought that it might take a couple of weeks for the set-up to occur. With this particular trade, though, I'm looking to add a position if it fails a retest of the 1.0 Fib shown on this chart and retraces; if it blows through that, I'll reexamine where the next level of resistance is and wait before considering the addition of positions: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
This is what I am asking about specifically. Sometimes trades never come back. How do you decide when to exit those first two entries? Or you don't exit them, you just wait for another advantageous time to build the position?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
My general rule is don't exit unless you're at least break even. However, I do want to get something out of every net position, even if it's just five pips. I am comfortable with the fact that I might have to wait to add for a few days, especially where I've got a positive swap working in my favor. It is possible that I will run into a situation going forward where I have to hold something for several weeks, but that hasn't happened yet. Looking at even some of the more high performing folks' Trade Explorers, it appears that this is not an uncommon practice.

7/16 New York Session Current Open Positions GBP/USD Short at 1.71258/TP 1.70888 GBP/AUD Short at 1.82948/TP 1.82118 (Moved to the .236) AUD/JPY Long at 95.181/TP 95.492 Pivot Point Based Entry Orders GBP/USD short addition; USD/JPY long entries deleted. Long-Term GTC Non-Pivot Point Based Entry Orders EUR/AUD short at 1.48635 GBP/NZD short at 1.98507 EUR/NZD short at 1.61901 Usable Margin: 97.51% Usable Maintenance Margin: 95.02% Current Position/Leg Size .5 x equity/.5% Margin Other Notes Unfortunately, nothing hit its TP last night. AUD was initially somewhat depressed but appears to have regained some of its lost ground, moving my AUD/JPY long position into slightly positive territory and my GBP/AUD short to nearly break even. The GBP/USD is hovering ten pips north of my sell entry between the pivot and the .618 line where has settled for the past few hours. I have deleted the GBP/USD short addition and the USD/JPY long entry orders, as I don't think price will hit the specified levels by the end of the NY sesh. At the end of the New York, I will again look at adding to the currently open positions and thinking about a few new ones. As with yesterday, however, there are likely to be slim pickings. This is because I am in GBP (2x), USD (1x), AUD (2x), and JPY (1x). I definitely don't want to be entering another GBP or AUD position, focusing instead on EUR, CAD, or CHF. I am waiting on the RBNZ's rate decision coming up this following week to revisit trades in the kiwi. So my possible combo's might be EUR/USD (since USD is only represented once in my current mix), EUR/JPY (JPY is currently only represented once), EUR/CAD, CAD/JPY, USD/CAD (USD only represented once in current mix), EUR/CHF, or CAD/CHF. However, if you're not in AUD already, you may want to have a gander at EUR/AUD (a short of this from the .764 would have been the better play yesterday than the AUD/JPY long; it hit the .764 and has retraced through the .236, which would have been a 30 pip + rip): Attached Image (click to enlarge) This, in fact, has been one of my favorite pairs to play recently due to its both short- and long-term range characteristics. Once I am able to exit my current AUD positions, I'll naturally revisit that pair and consider deleting my long-term play to take advantage of this pair's nice, rangey intraday movement. See you at the end of the New York session ... .

ZebraSqurl your method is quite sound because I am using the similar approach but with regular pivots.. The only thing different is I am using aggressive full lots on 10k account which has it's ups and downs.. I want to test and see if it can be possible to withstand some heavy DD before realizing net profit.. The obvious good thing would be to go with mini lots...also I am using heavy Fibonacci progression in averaging...1,1,2,3,5,8 .... (so far only went to level 4) Anyway keep up the good work

Yeah, I've seen a couple of videos of professional traders doing seminars using Daily Classic pivot points (using R3 and S3). One of the ones I looked at wasn't using the full span between those two levels, but looking primarily at retracements from, for example, the R3 to the R2 or a bounce from the S3 to the S2. Other methods I've looked at use Camarilla pivot points (daily), but look for price to oscillate between the Camarilla R3 and S3 or for breakout opportunities below or above those levels. The important thing for me, though, is not the size of lot, but how much the relationship of the lot size is to equity. If the rule is to confine my leg sizes to a percentage of equity, the lot size will vary depending upon how much equity you've got.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
This is why I'm keeping track of the amount of margin I've got as the trades cycle through the process. This will help me evaluate whether I can go bigger or need to go smaller with the percentage of margin I'm using per "leg." Right now, it looks like it's been behaving fairly well, with max open positions &lt;5% of usable margin/&lt;10% of usable maintenance margin (my account allows up to 50:1). Along with my avoidance of doubling up in currencies/keeping a balance of currencies for all open positions, this also keeps me from overtrading and being too exposed to the market. This may seem somewhat conservative, but I'm going for small, incremental increases in equity over time. You can, after all, get to a million dollars from $10,000 in 5-7 years if you can earn 8.3% return per month/100% per year (and compound (increase lot size as equity increases)). (Not a particular goal of mine, but wouldn't that be nice ... .) I have read comments by traditional traders (the ones that are shooting for 2-1 risk/reward with each trade), however, to the effect that 100% per year is unrealistic, but I have seen Trade Explorer stats here that bring that notion substantially into question.

Usable Margin: 97.51% Usable Maintenance Margin: 95.02% Current Position/Leg Size .5 x equity/.5% Margin Other Notes This being Wednesday, I ordinarily am reluctant to open new pair positions, since ideally I want to be out of everything or most everything by the weekend. However, I want to take advantage of any bounces EUR/USD experiences in tomorrow's session in light of U.S. data announcements, so that'll be my only new position. I looked at various other pairs, particularly those not represented in my current mix, but nothing sticks out as particularly attractive to me right now. The Fib boxes on all my open trades have contracted significantly, so I am likely going to have to settle for 10 pip gains on these (which is fine) to get out of them by the weekend. I had originally intended to ride the GBP/AUD bus for a while, but I don't want to have to keep a constant eye on it, so I'm kind of converting it to a short-term pivot trade.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
The positive swap on the GBP/AUD short is almost screaming out to me to hold it long-term (it is better than the AUD/JPY long), so I'm going to keep the AUD/JPY where it is, but move the GBP/AUD TP to the resistance level that appears at 1.81757. Hope I don't regret it later. (Gosh, make up your mind.)

Here are the levels I'm watching for a possible NZD long opportunity post-RBNZ rate decision: 1.858 (Long-Term Confluence) 1.8400 (Long-Term Confluence &amp; Psych Level). I sincerely doubt we would go all the way the to 1.8400 in the short-term (however, keep in mind that we were there only 5 weeks ago), but a reversal below 1.858 could spell a deeper pull back for the pair, especially against the overall backdrop of Fed tapering and 2015 interest rate hikes (USD strength). We'll just have to see how it plays out: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Also, I could see day trading doing this with a multi-screen or other set-up so that you could efficiently look at a large number of pairs at the same time or one after another in short order, looking for when price hits a pivot point for a given pair. If you're just staring at one pair, it could take hours for price to hit the pivot you want to look at. I assume that the basic cycle is to (1) wait for price to hit the S3 or R3; (2) wait for the following candle(s) to provide confirmation; and (3) exit at the opposing pivot. As far as SL management is concerned, you'd probably want to set it at the S4 for a buy or the R4 for a sell. I would think that the vast majority of times, the risk-reward would be greater than 2-1 from the S3 to the R3 if your stop is placed at the S4 or R4. You could also watch the pivot points for breakout opportunities. Naturally if price hits the pivot then blows through it, price may be breaking out. I think that this article covers the basics of trading breakouts: http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/educati...ot-Points.html and this one the basics of trading intraday reversals: http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/educati...Reversals.html If you have the time to devote to having your eyes on the computer screen to watch these unfold in real time, you can also consider dynamic trades, selling from the R3 and then buying at the S3, selling again at the R3, which I would personally love to be able to do.

Was hoping that my addition to my GBP/USD short would execute before hitting the hay so that I could adjust the TP, but price appears stalled on the ask side at 1.71411, and I need bid to reach 1.71410 for my order to execute. Remarkable how the ask is so diligently hugging that .736 pivot point.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Spoke too soon; addition order just executed. Average sell price is now 1.71334, so TP moved to 1.71234 (which is around the .236).

Zebra have you tested Camarilla Pivots vs the Standard Pivots? I trade breakouts and retracements from standard pivots, but for price to brake from R2 to R3 or S2 to S3 on standard pivots you have to wait a looong time for that because I'm trading 2,3 pairs (majors) and that doesn't happen that often I am intrigued by the Camarilla pivots, but never used them so don't know how they work in theory...will try to find something to read about them Btw. I have time for daytrading, that's why I want to master in pivots

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Using Classic pivots for day trading doesn't seem productive, unless you're only going from like the S3 to the S2; going the full span would take some time. Here's the explanation of how Camarilla's are calculated here: http://www.futuresmag.com/2012/10/24...marilla-pivots The article has to do with trading futures that way, but the same principles apply with forex. If you compare the size of the "box" between Camarilla and Fib retracement, they're actually very close, and I imagine the central pivot is, in fact, exactly the same. I never gave Camarillas a good run (which is funny, since the origin of use of pivot points is that DailyFx article the link to which I posted above, and he uses pivot points). I guess I just fell into using Fib retracement pivot points, got comfortable with them, and have used them ever since. But I don't think there's a significant difference between the two.

AUD/JPY TP hit ... . Doesn't look like I would've gotten much more out of that trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I posted last night that my GBP/USD short hit its TP, which was the .236. If I could have stayed awake and monitored the trade, however, it would have benefitted me to stay in it a bit longer, moving the SL to BE or the .236 (since it ran 20 pips past that): Attached Image (click to enlarge) At the time it hit its TP, moving a stop loss to BE would have been far too tight. Just goes to show ... would be nice not to have a day job.

Well, having just looked at USD/JPY, it is surprisingly near the buy area I mentioned in one of my earlier posts (around 101.25), so that may be worth looking at. If you have time to watch it today, it might be worthwhile to see how it reacts to 101.25 and taking a long there or, if it blows through that level, looking at 101.08, which would be a retracement all the way back to the 7/10 low: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
GBP/JPY is presenting with a similar trajectory as USD/JPY. Ordinarily, the set-up would be ripe to consider a "buy" for GBP/JPY, as it appears to be approaching a level tested on 7/10. My concern with that, however, is that Cable is generally at quite elevated levels and may have gotten ahead of itself somewhat on the heels of Carney's "sooner than later" interest rate hike speech in mid-June, so I would prefer a buy at a much deeper retracement (ballpark: pre- or near- 6/12 levels, which would be south of 172.00). That being said, it might be worth watching price's reaction to the 173.1 level (it's very close to that right now; not sure it's really tested it with any conviction) to see if it's worth a scalp of some kind on the bounce. Also, trading this pair is not for the light of heart; swings can be quite violent, and you can quickly find yourself 25 pips on the wrong side of the trade. Even given these low volatility conditions, the ATR is almost at 90 pips on a daily basis, and it has moved a bit more than that today.

7/17 New York Session Current Open Positions USD/JPY Long at 101.150/TP 101.478 Usable Margin: 99.5% Usable Maintenance Margin: 99.01% Current Position/Leg Size .5 x equity/.5% Margin Other Notes Wow. This is just one of those days that nothing -- and I mean absolutely nothing -- looks attractive using pivot points for short term range trading, at least at the end of the New York session. Everything I've looked at is outside its Fib box, short-term trending, and is breaking out to the one side or the other ... in other words, a poor environment for short-term, rangey movement within the .236 and .764 lines. Also, we've only got one day left in the trading week, and I don't want to commit too heavily to a bunch of different positions that would have to worry about over the weekend. So, perhaps this is a good thing. Consequently, I will have to break other tools out of the tool box to make a trade of some kind. As previously mentioned, I was interested in waiting for USD/JPY to hit a buy zone around 101.25 or even 101.08, a set-up based upon longer-term Fib levels and/or support/resistance. (Hey, sometimes you have to adapt). Because it is basically at the "0" line, I set the TP at the pivot point two levels above that, or the .618. And we'll see how that goes ... .

After looking over a couple of more charts and longer-term set-ups, I've also fashioned an entry order to short GBP/NZD at 1.97401/TP 1.96899, which has executed. This is one of those highly volatile pairs that are not for the faint of heart. Nevertheless, price was in my sell zone for this pair, so I don't feel like I should pass it up with trading set-ups I like so few and far between. Moreover, it's another one of those pairs with great positive swap for a sell position so, like GBP/AUD, I feel comfortable carrying it for several days and letting it run .... .

GBP/NZD short TP deleted. This is one of those trades that has the potential to run a significant distance if it doesn't get wild and run up to retest my sell area. What I'm going to do is just let it run free, check in on it from time to time, and then move the SL to capture any gains it makes. My SL is at break even now, so it is basically a risk free trade.

Hi mate, when you say you use Fib Retracement Pivot Points (Daily) are those regular pivots or the Camarilla pivots? I also use FXCM and can't find the Camarilla pivots (I have an option for Fib Retracement but nothing about Comarilla). Also do you set the fibs to the high/low of the last daily candle? One more question, do you trade the breakouts of R4 / S4 according to that link of Camarilla pivots you posted or just the bounces between? Cheers

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I use the Trading Station web platform, since I'm a Mac user. But if you click on the add indicators icon, then the PIVOT indicator, a dialogue box should open. Click on the Parameters tab. To the right of "Calculation Mode," click on the box where "Classic Pivot" appears (which is the default). A drop down box should appear with various pivot point types, the last of which listed is "Fibonacci Retracement." That's what I use. The Camarilla is listed after the Classic Pivot. Camarilla are substantially similar, but use a different formula to calculate them, and I think that both are pretty much fine (the ranges of the two are extremely close). The Daily Classic pivots tend to involve too great a range to be useful for short-term trading. You can naturally manually do your own Daily Fib Retracement pivot points manually by going from the previous day's high to the low, but the indicator should do that for you. I primarily do bounces between levels, although I've been thinking about adding breakouts to my "tool box." This would give me more trading set-ups, I imagine. Happy trading!

Well, I stepped out, got something to eat, went to the gym, and then had another look at my charts just to see if anything stuck out that would be worth attempting to get in and out on Friday, but nothing particularly pops out that is exciting and that can't wait a couple of days. Going forward, I naturally want to get back into EUR (and particularly EUR/USD), but the substantial downward movement it experienced in the last couple of days (ending in a thud at 1.3525) has me wanting to wait for a little bit of a bounce before going short again using the pivots (my long-term outlook is bearish due to ECB easing and Fed tightening, so I could arguably just start shorting on any bounce to the daily .764, holding, and then unloading when it's particularly profitable). I also want to pay some attention to GBP/USD, but have some concerns about its current levels. It seems poised to break lower, but has been in such a long-term bull trend ... and near a multi-year high. In fact, multi-time frame analysis would suggest to continue to buy it on dips; it's just that I can't bring myself to do that at this level. Moreover, pulling back to larger time frames (e.g., 4H) shows that it's been largely moving sideways since 7/1 -- perfect conditions for range trading, really, so I should just suck it up, use the pivot points to trade intraday movement, and not get excited if it moves against my position. Similarly, AUD/USD has been basically sideways since 7/1, but there I want to focus on longs, since if I do get caught in a position and have to wait out more advantageous entry points to add to the position, I don't want the usually modest pippage I'm going for to be eaten alive by swap. Again, however, it should be ideal for pivot point-based trading since it is currently within a range and certain AUD crosses like EUR/AUD are similarly attractive for that reason. Yen crosses are, on the whole, a mixed bag. I have been a big fan of EUR/JPY, but like with EUR/USD, recent large movement has kept me out of the pair while it decides to settle into a new range, bounce, or decline further. I have also liked CAD/JPY, but recent data has contributed to substantial movement both long and short, making it unattractive. GBP/JPY has suffered from similar movement at the beginning of this quarter. I am waiting after the RBNZ rate decision next week before wading into any NZD cross; like AUD, I only want to be long NZD due to swap. As far as CAD is concerned, it is likely going to take some time to settle after more data tomorrow ... . And my small USD/JPY long position is grinding slowly higher, although it appears to be having some trouble clearing the .382. It's always nice closing out all the trades you had for that week in profit, leaving you little to worry about over the weekend ... . Tomorrow I'll naturally check in on my USD/JPY long and post stats for how the week went ...

For example, one leg of a GBP/NZD short position was -128 pips, even though the net position resulted in a 50.2 pip profit. (You can clearly see the dip in the equity curve that this negative leg produced around 7/7). Nearly 36% of the month's gross loss is attributable to that leg: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It just goes to show how I might want to avoid more violently moving pairs ... . All in all, though, what I'm looking for is present in the smooth, upward movement of the equity curve ... .

Well, Monday's back to the day job (been on vacation for a couple of weeks here), so I'll probably have less time to post my trading blow by blow, but I naturally want to keep track of the trades, the margin being utilized and such because I think it's important to look at the way I'm trading, see where my weaknesses are, and attempt to improve in some small way. Although I don't agree with everything traditional analysts have to say about what to look for in a trade (largely because, from a purely psychological perspective, I just want to capture what I can fairly quickly and then get out and lack the patience for these 2-1 risk reward set-up's these guys are always waiting for; that's just me), I can say I agree with two things and that is (1) keep a journal; and (2) adhere to something close to the &lt;1% per position/&lt;10% total exposure rules. Even if you're too busy to keep a journal, adhere to the exposure rules. They'll give you room to make some mistakes and experiment with different tools and methodologies in the short run while keeping bigger goals available to you in the long (and you won't have a heart attack or be in a sweaty panic over every adverse movement a particular trade takes). Were I to have adhered to this one basic rule when I started out trading Forex about a year and a half ago, my learning curve would have been a much less bumpy and nerve-wracking road and my equity curve would look a little more like what I'm looking at now. Moreover, if you're just starting out with a live account, use the smallest lot possible for the first several weeks and, potentially, for the first several months as you assess your trading style and what works for you. I know that virtually every trader wants to just hop in and start the process of getting rich quickly, but every learning process takes time and mistakes will be made. You can naturally make bigger mistakes with smaller lots as you go through this process.

One last little "report". It's always interesting to see where you're making you're money, and here's where I made it month-to-date, with the top five highlighted: AUD/CHF 31.3 pips AUD/JPY 20.8 pips AUD/NZD 10.5 pips AUD/USD 26.7 pips CAD/JPY 31.0 pips CHF/JPY 30.7 pips EUR/AUD 25 pips EUR/CAD 10.1 pips EUR/CHF 2.7 pips EUR/JPY 78.5 pips EUR/NZD 10.6 pips EUR/USD 76.9 pips GBP/AUD 24.7 pips GBP/USD 77.7 pips NZD/JPY 10.0 pips NZD/USD 36.4 pips USD/JPY 74.2 pips GBP/CAD 70.4 pips GBP/NZD 49.4 pips CAD/CHF 10 pips Now this is only three weeks, but the thing I find interesting about this is the fact that I could literally just stick to the majors (CAD, EUR or CHF, GBP, JPY, and USD) without resorting to looking at a bunch of exotic crosses to find gains (I am intentionally leaving out AUD and NZD; not that there's anything bad about them, it's just that their swap forces me to only look at longs; EUR and CHF are so strongly correlated that you're basically trading on the same trajectories). Point in fact, I stumbled across one guy who just primarily trades gold, EUR/USD, and USD/JPY and finds success at it. https://twitter.com/Break_Retrace3 Imagine having to only look at only three different charts for your trade set-ups ... . Oh, and I guess I was net positive in every pair I traded, which kind of amazes me (although clearly that EUR/CHF trade was a waste of time ... 2.7 pips). Unlikely that I'm going to be able to repeat that month to month (just being realistic).

So, for this week, a couple of tweaks are in order. First, I requested a withdrawal of some money out of my account to play with elsewhere (if paying bills is called "playing," then that is what I was doing with it). Because this is "in process" and likely to take a few days, it is going to affect my usable margin/usable maintenance margin percentage later in the week, even though I am going to be keeping my lot size the same for my legs for now. The equity in the account will be $7,000 once that goes through, so the legs of my positions (4k) will be a rather weird number (4/7th's or .57% per leg). At this point in time, I view my putzing around with a system or strategy as largely educational, with the first several months or so of learning apparently being devoted to exactly what not to do so that when I actually eventually get serious money to play with, I won't be fumbling about trying to figure that out that, and I think that devoting risk capital of $5-10k for this purpose will be worth it in the long run. If I make some money while learning, well, that's icing on the cake. Point in fact, I am, at this point in time, still 2400 pips/$100 in the red from my first six to eight months of screwing around with various attempts to short-cut things using EA's, trading signals, Mirror Trader strategies, ill-advised oversized trades, and the like. I hate to repeatedly emphasize this, but it's a testament to the value of keeping things small when starting out: a $100 fee for 2400 pips of mistakes is a pretty good fee to pay for a schooling in what not to do. However, this is also why I am not yet too excited that I've been doing well in the past several weeks after just chucking all that crap out the window and starting from scratch; at least I have begun to feel comfortable with the fact that I might be on the path to knowing what I'm doing. I digress ... . The second tweak involves the number of pips to be taken when I can't exit the net position at the .764/.236 where doing so would result in a net loss for the position. Traditionally, I have just been saying, "Well, I just want to get out of the position ... . I'll settle for ten pips for the whole kit and kaboodle ... ." However, in looking back, for example, at the MTD's stat's, 62 trades were made for a total of just shy of 710 pips. I am not sure how many of those I settled for 10 pips on the net position, but my guess is quite a few, so I am going to seek out 15 pips net profit for those mult-leg positions going forward. I understand that this is a somewhat arbitrary number, but I'm going to use it for a while and see how things go. And so now on to looking at charts for the upcoming Asian ... .

7/20 Asian Opening So if you've dropped in on this thread from time to time, you kind of know my cycle. Today's a bank holiday in Japan, so the Asian session is likely to be sleepy, and the thing that sticks out at me for this coming week is the RBNZ's rate decision, which is now forecast for a .25% bump up (thought they were forecasting no bump last week?). As is my usual routine, I start out looking at EUR/USD and EUR/JPY first charts and then go from there. EUR/USD &amp; EUR/JPY. Ideally, I still would like to see a bounce more toward the 200 hour SMA before wading in short again for either of these pairs. However, I am going to go out on a limb here, and fashion an entry order to short EUR/JPY at its .764 with the TP being the .236. GBP/USD. On the 1H, the pair has broken through the 200 SMA, but remains above that MA on higher time frames. Nevertheless, the pair has been basically moving sideways since 7/1. Although the apparent consensus is that the BOE will hold its rates at their current levels at their next meeting on Wednesday, Carney will also be speaking and (as we saw on 6/12), his speeches can move the market significantly, notwithstanding the actual rate decision. Because of its short-term movement, I will be fashioning an entry order to short this pair at the .764 with the TP being the .236. So, so far, I've got EUR, USD, GBP, and JPY movement covered with my entries, leaving me to look at CAD, AUD, and NZD to fill out. As I have previously mentioned, I only like AUD and NZD longs due to swap, and I want to stay out of NZD until after the rate decision, which will be somewhat limiting. AUD/CAD. The 1H chart appears somewhat bullish, but higher time frames appear to conflict with this assessment. However, the pair also appears to have dropped into a range, at least extremely short-term, so AUD/CAD long entry at the .236/TP .764. This first round of entries basically covers all the bases that I want to touch: AUD (1x), CAD (1x) EUR or CHF (1x), GBP (1x), JPY (1x), and USD (1x). Now, I move onto a second round and see if there are any other pairs I want to get into, keeping an eye on not overemphasizing one currency over another if I can. EUR/CAD and CAD/CHF appear to be only similar, albeit inverse trajectories, with the former bearish, the latter, bullish. EUR/CAD short at the .764, TP .236. After that entry, I would be AUD (1x), CAD (2x), EUR or CHF (2x), GBP (1x), JPY (1x), and USD (1x), leaving AUD, GBP, JPY, and USD open to consideration (i.e., GBP/AUD (short), AUD/JPY (long), AUD/USD (long), GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY as possible combo's). GBP/AUD is already below the .236, making a retracement back to the .764 less likely; and AUD/JPY is an unattractive long right now. Similarly, an AUD/USD long from the .236 looks comparatively attractive, but the pair is already above the .764, making all of these combinations either unattractive or unrealistic. Sometimes you just can't get all pairs equally represented in your mix. This kind of leaves me with settling with an entry order in either USD/JPY or GBP/JPY. Quite frankly, I rarely visit GBP/JPY, at least recently. Movement can be violent. Like GBP/USD, the pair is bullish long-term, but has taken a bearish turn in the short-term. USD/JPY is on the bear side of a fairly long-term range, so I'm going to opt for a GBP/JPY short at the .764, TP .236. That should just about do it ... .

This is a really cool thing: http://fxtrade.oanda.com/analysis/to...ers-statistics One thing sticks out: Oanda 's Top 100 traders on average are going for extremely short-term plays (&lt;4 hours) with small pippage (&lt;20 pips) (wow). Oanda says that "These forex traders are not selected exclusively on their overall amount of realized Profit and Loss, since that would skew the results toward hedge fund and big institutional accounts ... [but] are sampled from a wide range of account balances, from the micro, to the institutional." This leads me to believe that the analysts who are going for "moon shot" trades with large movement using Daily charts may possibly be going about things all wrong or, at least, aren't representative of the vast majority of traders and, possibly, are not even representative of winning traders. The only way we could get stats like those posted by Oanda would be if the vast majority of traders were going for small pippage on short-term trades, thus offsetting by some margin winning traders who use more traditional approaches (large time-frame charts, few trades, and holding positions for days if not weeks). Too bad Oanda doesn't break the stats down to see exactly how traders who use longer-term strategies are fairing as a group; then we could really see if the "old" school of trading is actually the "bad" school or the at least "less successful than the extremely short-term trader" school.

Adding a USD/JPY good for day entry to buy at 101.187 (the .236); TP 101.356 (the .764). The pair has been in a range for a good, long while, and this is the same buy zone as last week. If you have a chance to keep eyes on the pair, though, you may want to wait to see if the pair returns to the 101.08 level, since there is a level of resistance there that's been tested twice (7/10 and 7/17) in recent weeks and also at the end of May. Also, my GBP/USD short executed. Ugh, day job tomorrow.

7/21 Early Asian The GBP/USD short hit its target price: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... and the AUD/CAD long executed, as well the EUR/CAD short; the remainder of the orders expired without executing. The first thing I will do is adjust TP's to the new, appropriate pivot point. EUR/CAD's TP is moved to the new .236 (1.45143), and an entry order is fashioned to add to the position should price hit the new .764 (1.45324). AUD/CAD's TP is moved to the new .764 (1.00847). Because current price is below the .236 and because there is a support level at approximately the -.272, an entry order is fashioned to add to the position should price hit the -.272 (1.0050). Moving on to consider new positions: my currently open positions consist of EUR (1x), AUD (1x), and CAD (2x), leaving GBP, JPY, and USD currently unrepresented, with GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY as possibilities. I would like to avoid GBP/JPY due to its volatility. USD/JPY as already above the 1 line. Consequently, I am going to repeat yesterday's choice of shorting GBP/USD at the .764, the TP being the .236 (sell at 1.70882/TP 1.70678). Nevertheless, I'd like to attempt to get into some kind of Yen cross, but nothing looks particularly attractive to me right now. I may check in a bit later ... . In summary: Open Positions EUR/CAD short at 1.45413; TP 1.45143. AUD/CAD long at 1.00611; TP 1.00847. Good for Day Entry Orders EUR/CAD short at 1.45324/TP 1.45143 (Addition to Open Position) AUD/CAD long at 1.00500/TP 1.00847 (Addition to Open Position) GBP/USD short at 1.70882/TP 1.70678.

The AUD/CAD long hit its TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... as did the EUR/CAD short: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The other entry orders did not execute in the Asian/London sessions, so I am going to delete those, look at charts in the early New York (day off, whee!!!), and reload set-up's that have a shot at executing in the New York. These two charts are also kind of a demonstration of why you don't want to double up on currencies. Although I benefitted from favorable CAD movement for both of these pairs on this particular occasion, it could have also amplified adverse movement if it had gone the other way ... .

The things that stick out on the calendar for me in the next coming days are GBP rate decision/Carney babble and the RBNZ rate decision (tomorrow). I am staying out of NZD entirely until after the RBNZ announcement, and will probably avoid GBP for a couple of days as well. As you might recall, it was not really the BOE's rate decision last time that prompted GBP/USD's run up to nearly test 1.72, it was Carney's comments afterwards. Looking over the charts, it looks like the USD is displaying some strength post-CPI data, and that this is affecting a lot of pairs. I imagine that the data suggests that the U.S. economy is "on track" for the end of QE and eventually rate hikes in 2015 some time. Also looks like I missed an opportunity to short EUR/JPY from the .764: Attached Image (click to enlarge) My notion there was that price (at the beginning of the Asian session) was already over the 1 line and was unlikely to retrace to the .236. I probably should have just set up the entry order to short at the .764. Naturally if it just kept going up, the order would not have executed, which would have been fine ... . In any event, nothing looks particularly attractive right now from the use of pivot points perspective to capitalize on specified intraday ranges ... . Although as I'm writing this, it looks like USD is retracing a bit of its strength ... (check out USD/JPY): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Another missed short last session ... GBP/AUD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) (A EUR/AUD short had virtually the same trajectory ... .) Sometimes my effort to not double up on currencies causes me to miss set-ups. I missed this particular opportunity because I already had an AUD long (AUD/CAD) and had an entry order to short GBP/USD (which didn't execute). I figure it's better to be safe than sorry in the long run. (But not doing an entry order to short EUR/JPY was kind of stupid; I wasn't in EUR or JPY ... .) I used to be less careful about doubling up on currencies, and it has caused me problems on occasion. For instance, I can recall one time where I was basically "shot-gunning" set-ups, setting up entry orders for basically everything that met my criteria. This approach caused me to take positions in three Yen crosses at once. To make a long story short, they all took virtually the same trajectory, amplifying adverse movement by factor of three. I eventually got out of the positions net positive over the next several days, but convinced myself not to do that again where possible or, at least, keep a balance of currencies across my open positions if that was possible.

End of New York Session Here's what I'm going to look at today. I'm going to stay away from GBP and NZD for the next couple of days until after their respective rate decisions, since that is likely to make things particularly turbulent for pairs involving those two. Unfortunately, Euro weakness has infected virtually every Euro cross, making them unattractive as short-term pivot point based range range trades. I'll just have to wait for the Euro to digest its weakness in the coming days; I'm still looking for some kind of short-term bounce of the Euro to wade back in short. With my staying away from GBP and NZD, and now EUR, my choices are somewhat limited. EUR/USD: Unattractive. Pair has moved below the .236 and movement is somewhat impulsive. AUD/USD: Possible long trade. Pair has been somewhat rangebound/short-term bullish on 1-6H charts. EUR/JPY: Unattractive. Similar trajectory to EUR/USD: short-term impulsive movement. USD/JPY: Possible long trade. Pair inhibited by support in the 101.10-.25 area and resistance in the 102.75 area for time now and would arguably be toward the low end of this range. AUD/JPY: Possible long trade. Pair has broken 200 hour SMA; higher time frames are somewhat equivocal with price action either waddling back and forth across the 200 period SMA or on the bearish side of it . USD/CAD: Possible long trade. Extremely short-term range-bound on the 1H (since 7/15) with support at 1.073/resistance 1.077, but bearish on higher time frames. USD/CHF: Unattractive. The inverse trajectory of EUR/USD. EUR/AUD: Unattractive. Similar trajectory as EUR/USD. CHF/JPY: Unattractive. Inverse trajectory of EUR/JPY. AUD/CAD: Possible long. Somewhat short-term narrowly rangebound since 7/15 (much like USD/CAD). EUR/CAD: Unattractive. Similar trajectory as EUR/USD. CAD/JPY: Unattractive. Unusually narrow rangebound conditions. AUD/CHF &amp; CAD/CHF: Unattractive. Inverse trajectories to EUR/AUD and EUR/CAD. Ordinarily, I would not want to double up in currencies, which I would be doing were I to take all the trades that have been highlighted. However, sometimes you have to do this when that is all that the market gives you. That being said, I am going to fashion entry orders, see what executes as I check in from time to time, and then potentially delete orders as is appropriate to minimize the doubling of representation of currencies if that is possible. However, if you do want to take the ideal "no doubling up" trade combo, I would go for the USD/JPY long and AUD/CAD long and just leave it that for this evening's trading. In summary: Open Positions None Good for Day Entry Orders AUD/USD long at .93767/TP .94069 USD/JPY long at 101.409/TP 101.530 AUD/JPY long at 95.109/TP 95.405 USD/CAD long at 1.70388/TP 1.07518 AUD/CAD long at 1.00713/TP 1.01011 Usable Margin/Usable Maintenance Margin 100%/100%

My sidelining myself from GBP and NZD because of upcoming news events related to those currencies leads me to wonder whether I am missing out and whether I should consider deploying news-driven breakout plays using the pivot points, something I confess I haven't tried before. This is largely because I think breakout plays should be monitored closely with eyes on the applicable chart to move any SL up to break even as soon as the opportunity presents itself. Breakouts, after all, don't always materialize or there's a lack of follow-through subsequent to the breakout. Because I have a day job, I don't always have time to monitor such plays when the data comes out. For example, Carney is speaking tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. my time, which is usually when I have to leave for work, leaving the timing of the announcement kind of poor for my monitoring a breakout play. In any event, this is how the breakout play would be set-up. First, look at that day's pivot points. You would be looking for a long entry a pip above the 1.272 line or a pip below the -.272. Since you will have no idea of which way the market will respond to the rate announcement and Carney's speech, you will want to fashion a "One Cancels Other" (OCO) entry order to go long if price hits 1 pip above the 1.272 or go short if price hits 1 pip below the -.272. If price goes to the long side at hits the entry price, the order to go short would be cancelled, and vice versa. The TP, however, is a somewhat delicate matter and would be assisted, naturally, by an eyes-on approach where you can look at the candles and see whether the trend is exhausting and then exit. In an unmonitored trade situation, however, you are going to have to pull a TP out of your butt or use some tool other than the pivot points to assist you as to what that target should be. For example, I might pick a fixed amount of pippage or (if I were more ambitious, the nearest swing high or low, the nearest obvious S/R, or the nearest Fib level). In the case of GBP/USD, then, I would set an OCO order to buy if price hits 1.70972 (1 pip above the 1.272) or to sell if price hits 1.70301. The TP (if price goes long) would be set at the nearest Fib (and also resistance at 1.7165 or so); if short, at 1.6973 (which is the nearest Fib line below). If possible, it would probably be best to wait shortly before the BOE rate announcement/Carney's speech in case the pair gets unduly frisky ahead of time and hits one of the prices because of that. This is also one of those times (a news announcement driven play) where you will want to have an entry order in place ahead of the news announcement; attempting to get into the trend mid-stream immediately after the announcement is often difficult where price is changing rapidly. Not suprisingly, price is currently sitting at the pivot point for the day, probably because traders do not want to commit to a position long or short so close to the rate announcement. If I do such an entry order, I'll post it here. It is possible that I will use a comparatively small lot size this time around and a modest TP (+15 pips) just to see how it works out.

AUD/JPY spiked in the long direction, but unfortunately didn't spike downwards first to catch the .236 and is now above the 1 line. Consequently, the AUD/JPY long entry order is deleted, as it is unlikely to retrace to the .236 given the impulsive movement. Also, the USD/JPY long entry order executed ... .

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I've gone ahead and set up the GBP One Cancels Other (OCO) order to accommodate breakouts in either direction (long/short). Because this is somewhat of an experiment and because I won't be awake at the time of the BOE announcement (4 a.m. my time), I am going for a modest 15 pips of action to either side of the pivot point box. Here's how it looks on my FXCM Trading Station web platform, with the top order being the short, the bottom being the long: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We'll see how that goes ... .

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Here's the previous rate announcement's effect on price action: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I guess I was previously mistaken about the timing of Carney's speech, which was on June 12th (prompting a 100 pip bull run) and occurred before the rate announcement on June 18th (which tacked on an additional 100 pips in the 24 hours thereafter (and then more ... and more until nearly testing 1.7200 nearly 400 pips later)). Naturally we're at a different juncture in GBP/USD price at this moment in time, which may result in a more muted reaction to the rate announcement (pure speculation here).

--- 帖子 #82 ---
But the concern with breakouts is this kind of thing (see ovals) -- the dreaded break and retrace: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is why I like to be awake and actively monitoring these trades. In both of the highlighted situations, the SL could have been moved to break even before the retrace, making the trade a no risk proposition.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Wow ... very little reaction to the BOE minutes, at least not enough to push GBP/USD into breakout mode, so I'm deleting the OCO order. Price may be waiting on Carney, but I now have my doubts about that given what's contained in the minutes, which points out a muddled picture regarding UK economic growth going into Q4. Would have been better off doing the standard pivot-point based range trade, as price did move from the .764 to the .236 and, in fact between the 0 and the 1. So, the actual rate decision resulted in a collective yawn from traders (although at the New York open, it appears that GBP/USD is primed to break lower). In comparison, a breakout play above the 1.272 would have been productive in, for example, AUD/USD long, although the use of Camarilla pivot pivots (in that case, a break above the R4) would have been more productive as compared to a breakout above the 1.272 using Fib retracement pivot points, although it remains to be seen whether price will follow through higher. As far as my remaining positions are concerned, the USD/CAD long slumped by 15 pips in overnight trading; the USD/JPY long is virtually flat at -3 pips shortly before the New York open. See you at the end of the New York session.

This is going to be a really quick posting ... (a bit pressed for time).

If you don't want to double up, I would compare rewards of, for example, EUR/CAD vs. GBP/CAD (pick the one with the greater) and then either EUR/JPY or GBP/JPY. If you pick EUR/CAD, then pick GBP/JPY; if GBP/CAD, then EUR/JPY. Happy trading!

USD/CAD hits TP: {Personal Info Removed} Other entry orders expired, unexecuted, leaving me with only my EUR/CAD short open, the TP for which is moved to the new .236 (which happens to be just about 15 pips away). The short on that pair still looks like a pretty good set-up at this point, although there are some concerns with the way in which it has bounced off the lows yesterday. Nevertheless, I am generally bearish on the Euro, so I will add to the open position should price revisit the .764. With a position only open in EUR and CAD, the world is my oyster, but I want to be somewhat conservative here in the sense that it's Thursday, and I don't want to carry a bunch of stuff over the weekend unless it's really to my advantage to do so. Looking over the charts, the following are candidates for this type of trading and, I think, could easily traverse the .764 to .236 between now and the New York close tomorrow: GBP/JPY AUD/JPY (long only) Other pairs have experienced recent impulsive movement, which I want to stay away from, are trading in extremely narrow ranges that aren't worth wading into (EUR/USD), or have price currently outside the .236 to .764 range. GBP/JPY is range-bound on an extremely short term basis between 173.45 and 172.70-ish, with the floor providing more tidy resistance than the ceiling. It is bearish (below the 200 SMA) on the 1H through 4H, but transitions to bullish on 6H + time frames. AUD/JPY is now bullish on the 1-6H time frames, but the concern here is that it is not all that far away from its yearly high of 96.50, and there is a bit of impulsive bullish movement nearby leftover from 7/22 data. If AUD/USD is any indication, there may a little bit more retracement ahead for the pair, presenting a better buying opportunity. As you know, I generally only like to long AUD and long NZD due to swap, since I never know when I may get caught in a trade with these currencies that may require a longer term commitment than I would like. Since I've all but eliminated AUD/JPY as a possibility right now, I will look at GBP/JPY a little more closely, using traditional Fib retracements on both a 4H and 8H chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Directly below the current range of price action is a confluence of levels at 172.44, which may provide a bit of solid, short-term resistance. Directly above is resistance at the .618 Fib level formed from the 5/29 low to the 7/3 high, but S/R around this level has not been clean. Above that is the .764 Fib formed from the 3/18 low to the 7/2 high, around which there are plenty of wick-throughs and false break-outs. The 8H Alligator for this pair is clearly bearish, but as you go lower in time frame (and particularly below 4H), the lips, teeth, and mouth of this indicator have intertwined, indicating there may be indecision as to direction. Although the reward of a trade that shorts at the .764 with the TP being the .236 for this ordinarily violent pair (17.9 pips) is that great, I am going to go out out on a limb and short it from the .764, since the short-term trajectory for the pair is bearish. In summary: Current Open Positions EUR/CAD Short at 1.44660/TP 1.44448 (Moved to the New .236) Pivot Point Based Entry Orders EUR/CAD good for day entry order to sell at 1.44694/TP 1.44448 GBP/JPY good for day entry order to sell at 172.943/TP 172.764 Usable Margin: 99.09%; Usable Maintenance Margin: 98.19% Current Position/Leg Size .57 x equity/.57% Margin

GBP/JPY hits modest TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Current Open Positions EUR/CAD Short at 1.44647 (Net Position: 2 Legs/TP 1.44448) Pivot Point Based Entry Orders None Usable Margin: 98.18%; Usable Maintenance Margin: 96.35% Current Position/Leg Size .57 x equity/.57% Margin Notes Of modest concern is the bounce against my EUR/CAD position that mimics USD/CAD's upward trajectory. I am likely to stand aside from adding to the position until the pair sorts itself out; my long-term sentiment remains bearish with respect to the Euro, and EUR/CAD's bearish decline has been lengthy with the year's low set in January (1.4411) within striking range of current price. Nevertheless, it is critical with this particular strategy not to mechanically enter additional positions, even if the movement against the direction of the original trade ultimately proves to be fleeting, but rather to wait for price action to reaffirm the overall downward trend, by, for example, rebreaking the 200 hour SMA, which price sits above at the moment. There is also some argument for the notion that the pair is short-term range-bound, with the floor sitting at 1.4445 and the ceiling potentially at the 1.4615-35 area. If that is the case, the pair is at the lower end of this range, and it is best to wait until it moves higher, potentially testing the aforementioned area once again: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Week's Results Well, it's hard to have a week better than a 100% win rate: {Personal Info Removed} 8 Trades 167.9 Pips 100% Win Rate/0% Loss Rate APT: 20.99/ALT 0 Naturally, next week is bound not to be as fantastic, as the task of gracefully exiting that EUR/CAD short position lies ahead, and at least one of those legs will no doubt be in the red. Nevertheless, this marks the fourth net profitable week in a row since I've been keeping stats on this methodology's performance, and the fourth week in a row in which every net position was exited in profit.

During a recent, eventually totally off-topic discussion in a thread, the issue of "reasonable expectations" came up for forex trading. Point in fact, I barely give the issue of my "reasonable expectations" for my trading a thought prior to that discussion. I was surprised to learn that for the vast majority of brokers (and perhaps all of them), less than 50% of their forex trading retail customers are profitable. On average, across all brokers, studies of retail traders show that they are abysmally unsuccessful, with only an average of 35% for all brokers in the study showing profitability: "During the [FY 2013 third quarter], brokers reported that 35% of US retail forex traders made money, with 65% experiencing losses." http://forexmagnates.com/exclusive-q...-clients-gain/ That turned out to be kind of a "wow" to me ... . You mean to say that I am far more unlikely to be unsuccessful than successful at this? Bummer. So, I thought about it ... what exactly do I expect to get in terms of returns -- 1% a month, 2%, 20%? Am I doomed to lose money? Do I even have a clue? When I first started out, quite frankly, I bought into the hype a little bit. You've read the stories about one trader or another making a gajillion in three days or or the first three hours of the week, doubling their equity in 30 days, or having 180 winning trades in a row, etc., etc. Yes, I know those traders are out there, and there's probably a few highly successful traders here at ForexFactory, and you've no doubt enviously eyed the stats showing in their Trade Explorers and asked yourself what they could possibly be doing right and you could be doing wrong. It is obvious that it is possible to be hugely successful trading forex, but is it likely ? Unfortunately, that forexmagnates article says "no." Well, what about a middle ground, then? One between raking money in hand over fist and blowing up your account? Where is it? What amount of return is a "reasonable expectation" in this business? Quite frankly, I don't know ... yet. I know that, to a certain extent, reading about other traders' expectations is not particularly helpful for me, since everyone trades a little bit differently. But keeping track of the pips I have gained, the average profitable trade, the average losing trade, and my win rate over the past month has helped me begin to hone in on particular numbers that will tell me that "This is the number of pips you can make during an average week; this is what you should be using for a lot size per position; and so this is what you can make, on average, per month." In short, this is what your "reasonable expectation" should be for the way you trade. For the last four weeks (which admittedly isn't all that statistically significant), that ROI is 3.63% -- 3.63% per month, and that is using .5 x equity per leg of my trades, and keeping somewhat below 10 x equity for all open positions (which is what the gurus recommend). So, I guess that number is my current "reasonable expectation" for a return on my trading going forward. Naturally, the percentage seems kind of paltry at the moment, but if I can improve on that, I'll be happy. It is less than the 8.3% per month (100% per year) I would like to be doing, but hey ... you gotta start somewhere ... , and for me 8.3% per month may simply not be a "reasonable expectation" for the way I am trading right now. It just goes to show that it pays to start slow and set your expectations low ... .

Coming up on the formation of new pivot points ... . Here's what pairs generally meet my criteria (agreement between 1H and 6H charts as to price's relationship to the 200 period MA): New Entry Orders EUR/USD short GBP/USD short (however, slightly above 200 period MA on 6H) AUD/USD long EUR/JPY short USD/JPY long (however, right at 200 period MA on 6H) AUD/JPY long EUR/AUD short GBP/AUD short I am currently in EUR (1x) and CAD (1x), so I will want to avoid doubling up in those if possible. Open Positions EUR/CAD short (possible addition at/near resistance, but there is no agreement between 1H and 6H charts; 1H is above 200 period MA; 6H is below) Notes I still am leaving NZD out of the mix, as I am only looking for longs due to swap, and the kiwi appears to be in bearish mode. I'll post entry orders in a few minutes after the pivot points form ... .

Current Open Positions EUR/CAD Short at 1.44647/TP 1.44448 Pivot Point Based Entry Orders EUR/AUD good for day entry order to sell at 1.43079/TP 1.42802 EUR/JPY good for day entry order to sell at 137.099/TP 136.816 GBP/USD good for day entry order to sell at 1.69887/TP 1.69715 Usable Margin: 98.17%; Usable Maintenance Margin: 96.35% Current Position/Leg Size .57 x equity/.57% Margin Notes I decided to stand aside from a EUR/CAD entry right now. Price is above the .764, and I think it could use some settling before making an addition. When I looked at my other candidates, they were either outside the .764 or the .236 or the range between those two levels was too small to monkey with. I would note that I am taking multiple positions in EUR, which is ordinarily inadvisable. I think what I will do there is check in from time to time and see what executes first and then possibly delete the other EUR entry order at that time. It is possible that the EUR/JPY entry will not execute because it is currently at the .236, but I've said that before, too. Calendar events look kind of light to me through the middle of the week ... .

As I do from time to time when I don't feel comfortable adding to a position using the Daily Fib Retracement pivot points, I resort to other tools to try and figure out a good entry point for the addition. This is because I lack the luxury of being able to monitor the trajectory of a given pair I'm interested in and/or have a position in (damn day job) and basically just have to figure out a point where an entry makes sense. I naturally don't want to miss an opportunity if at all possible, especially if my ability to exit a position net profitable is at stake. So, I've got a current position open in EUR/CAD (short). Using the pivot points I ordinarily do for an addition doesn't make sense at this moment in time; price is above the .764. I could naturally use the 1 or 1.272, but it's usually better to step back and look at the bigger picture. In this case, I'm going to look at Fib levels. Drawing a Fib from the 7/14 high to the 7/23 low on a 1H chart shows that there is a .50 Fib level at 1.45368 or so. Even without having the Fib level there, you can tell there is S/R around this level, with all sorts of tests of it dating back to 7/10: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pulling back to a 4H chart and drawing a Fib retracement between the 6/6 high and that same 7/23 low, there is also a little bit a confluence between that larger time frame's .236 (1.4548) and the .5 Fib on the 1H: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This may show that an entry between 1.4536 and 1.4548 may be a good place to make an addition, which is exactly what I've decided to do here: EUR/CAD good for day sell entry at 1.45366. I have the TP the same as the net position for now, but if it executes, I'll move the TP for the net position to +15 pips.

Why I Can't Force Myself to Go EUR/USD Long 65% of traders at Forex Factory are long this pair. Am I missing something? I don't think so, which why I cannot force myself to be long on this pair, and that's pretty much regardless of whether you're a swing trader or a scalper. On a long-term basis, using a daily chart (something I almost never do; I'm a scalper/day trader), EUR/USD is descending into hell: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It has already broken the 2014 low, which, if you were trying to call a low in the pair, you were incorrect to go long at that point. The next level of long-term resistance is at the .50 Fib (drawn from the 7/9/13 low) at 1.3373, so that might naturally provide some short-term resistance (which is always what I am looking for -- short-term plays). What about at the 4H? Ugh, it is at the -.382 level for the Fib drawn from the 6/5 low to the 7/1 high: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... and that Alligator indicator formation still looks bearish there (bearish trending parallel lines). The 1H paints a similar picture, with a series of bearish Alligator formations: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For my part, what I'm looking to do with this pair for short-term plays is to sell on bounces. However, you can see why this has been difficult since the beginning of the month. The bounces have been non-events. Instead, the pair slides down to a level, consolidates in a particularly narrow range, and then slides down to the next, and so on, with little opportunity to get in on the slide in a bounce unless you want to buy the pair at market, which I virtually never want to do. Naturally, I can see some movement on a 5 minute chart that would allow for selling on bounces in the downward trend, but even there you'd be largely bucking a short-term bearish trend if you're going long in the pair: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the next week or so, though, it may be worthwhile to watch how price responds to the 2014 low at 1.3478; although tested once on 7/24, the pair appears to be poised to "thunk" down another level against the larger backdrop of ECB easing and Fed tightening.

Where This System Can Fail As a realist, I think it's important to recognize when and where your system or method of doing things can fail and naturally attempt to avoid being put in such a situation, since that will naturally result in your incurring a loss. With this system in particular, opportunities to fail exist, and it is really quite simple to illustrate how they will occur. If you've read this thread at all, or similar threads, the basic methodology is to take an initial position and set a target price. If the target price is not hit, you add to the position in the direction of the original trade in a lot size that is the same amount as the original entry. So, say your original entry is a sell of 1K lots at the price 1.0, and your next entry is at price 2.0 for the same number of lots (1K). The average value of your net position is a sell at 1.5, and you've got 2K lots out there in that position. By adding the position, the average value of your net position has moved .5 units closer to current price, and is .5 units away from current price. Unfortunately, price moves against your position, and your next 1K entry is at the price of 3.0. Now, you have 3K lots in a position that is the average of those three entries (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0/3=2.0). While price again has moved .5 units closer to current price, it is now 1.0 units away from current price. Price again moves against your position, and your next 1K entry is at 4.0. Now, you have 4K lots in a position that is the average of all entries: (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0)/4=2.5. Price again has moved .5 unit closer to current price, but it is now 1.5 units farther away from break even. Well, you get the picture: as you add positions of like size to the net position, two things occur. First, the potential benefit of movement due to the addition of a "leg" to the net position may diminish -- having started out at a ratio of 1/1 (the total size of the open position/the size of the added position), the ratio diminishes from there to 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc. Secondly, your total lot size has increased, thus exposing your equity to greater loss if price continues to move further and further against your position. Knowing that both of these circumstances can occur is good, but knowing how to avoid them is better. Naturally, I totally misgauge the market from time to time or overlook an important piece of upcoming economic data that screws up my set-up, moving price against me. I could can panic and bail immediately, but that is unlikely to be the best price at which I can exit (which is one of many reasons that I do not use a fixed and visible stop loss). Instead, I do exactly what I do not want to do, and that is wait. I wait until the set-up is good again in the direction of my trade, price hits longer-term resistance, or experiences characteristics (crosses a critical MA, for example) similar to those that existed when I entered into the trade in the first instance, before wading back in with entries in the direction of my original trade.

A Longer-Term Sell and Hold for EUR/USD Using Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Points Given my studies of the EUR/USD charts above, I am going to undertake a longer-term sell and hold approach with EUR/USD, something I wish I would have done when the pair topped out at 1.4 (or shortly thereafter). The strategy will use smaller legs than usual, since I anticipate holding the net position for a few weeks, and use the Weekly (instead of the Daily) Fib Retracement Pivot Points. To start things off, I am setting up a GTC entry order to sell the pair should price reach the .764 (1.35184). Naturally, if price doesn't hit that by the end of the New York close on Friday, I'll delete it out, wait for the new weekly pivot points to paint on Monday, and enter a new order. TP for the net position will be set at around 1.3, a level it hasn't visited since July of 2013.

End of New York Session My GBP/USD short order executed, but the others expired unfilled. The price is nearly unchanged from the entry price, so there isn't much point in adding a position at this time. However, the TP is moved to + 15 pips instead of the new .236. I probably should have did the same thing with EUR/CAD; after entering the initial position, I set up an entry order to add to the position at nearly the same price (which I didn't think about at the time; I guess this is a new kind of "rule" -- don't add to a position if price hasn't changed substantially). My attempt to add a position to my EUR/CAD short was unsuccessful, which is somewhat of a good thing. At least temporarily, it is a sign that the pair is not moving immediately higher. That being said, it is not moving dramatically lower either. Another attempt will be made to add to the position in the next day of trading. Scrolling through the charts, nothing really stands out as being stellar. Many pairs have fallen into extremely narrow ranges between the .236 and the .764, which make them uninteresting for my purposes. Goofing around in such narrow ranges means that there is indecision as to direction and that a small impetus may set the ball rolling suddenly and unexpectedly, however. While I would like to revisit NZD, it would only be as a long, and I am not ready to call a bottom in NZD/USD (or a top in EUR/NZD or GBP/NZD). All of the NZD pairs appear momentarily stalled, and it is not yet clear whether NZD will continue lower or consolidate and attempt an upward move. As far as Yen crosses are concerned, both GBP/JPY and USD/JPY are of interest; the former because it appears to be appear to have fallen into a short-term narrow range, the latter because I am generally long dollar against the backdrop of Fed tightening and BOJ easing (although I don't know how raising tax rates can be aiding "easing"). Unfortunately, the .236 to .764 span of USD/JPY is &lt;10 pips, but I am going to do an entry order anyhow to capture that or, in the alternative, to establish a foothold for a longer-term play in the pair. I think that an AUD long has become somewhat attractive, but not necessarily when paired with USD. GBP/AUD and EUR/AUD shorts are frankly more interesting to me as long AUD plays, and I am opting for a EUR/AUD short entry due to the Euro's weakness relative to the Aussie as compared to Cable's. Lastly, I decided to transition to a larger lot size per leg (from 4K to 5K for approximately $7k of equity). It is apparent after looking over the UM/UMM percentages for the past several weeks that I have never approached using 10% of my usable margin, which indicates that I am trading quite conservatively. I have also given some thought to the notion that a 10% rule doesn't necessarily make sense with this kind of system (because, for one thing, there are no stop losses in play). Nevertheless, I don't want to go hog wild; I think 10% is a good rule of thumb. It is not, after all, just about the percentage of UM that is in play, but rather my comfort level with the dollar and cents intratrade drawdowns. So I'm going to bump it up 1K at a time, let that lot size cycle through a week or more of trades, see how I feel about the drawdowns, and move up if I am comfortable with the situation. Truth be told, I think the 10% rule will accommodate up to 1 x equity per leg with the way I trade (attempting to avoid doubling up in currencies where possible; careful addition to open positions that have not hit their target price); whether I would be comfortable with that remains to be seen, but I should know in a couple weeks whether that size is too rich for me personally. Current Open Positions EUR/CAD Short (Two Legs) at 1.44647/TP 1.44497 GBP/USD Short (One Leg) at 1.69888/TP 1.69738 (Moved to +15 pips) Pivot Point Based Entry Orders EUR/AUD short entry at 1.43020/TP 1.42830 USD/JPY long entry at 101.802/TP 101.885 EUR/CAD short entry at 1.45274/TP 1.44497 (Addition to Open Position) Usable Margin: 96.83%; Usable Maintenance Margin: 93.67%

What It Would Take For Me to Go NZD Long As you may know from reading this thread, I am not a big fan of NZD shorts due to the onerous swap/rollover. For example, FXCM is currently quoting EUR/NZD roll on the sell side as .85; -1.88 on the buy side; GBP/NZD: .94 on the sell, -2.09 on the buy; NZD/JPY: -1.22 on the sell, .56 on the buy; and NZD/USD: -1.11 on the sell, .52 on the buy. When you're looking to get in and out of trades quickly and for oftentimes for less than 25 pips like me, being on the wrong side of these equations for longer than you'd like can quickly eat into your pippage, and that's just not something I like to have to think about when I'm trading, so my basic attitude is no NZD shorts for me. So when will I wade into a long? Typically, the vast majority of trades I get into involve agreement between two charts: the 1H and the 6H. Generally speaking, I want to see price below the 200 period MA on both charts or above that MA on both charts. If it's above, I look to buy; below, to sell. If the charts conflict, I generally don't want to enter a trade for that pair, except in limited circumstances, such as where the pair is in a range and flopping back and forth across the MA. USD/JPY is a great example of this, with the 8H chart showing a long-term range in play: Attached Image (click to enlarge) However, if you look at the 1H, price looks bullish (it's above the 200 period MA), but price has been on both sides of the 200 period MA in recent history and, moreover, the MA line is somewhat flat. But the 6H is equivocal with price sitting right at the 200 period MA. I still might trade that pair, depending upon where the pair is in the longer-term range, even though the 1H and 6H charts really aren't in agreement as to price's relationship to the 200 period MA. In contrast, there is agreement as to NZD/USD's direction between the 1H and 6H charts (as if it wasn't obvious just by the pair's overall trajectory); it is solidly in bear mode. Where will the pair turn bullish? What will I be looking for? Looking at a daily chart, on which I've drawn a Fib line from the 8/13 low to the 7/14 high, there are all sorts of places where this might occur: Attached Image (click to enlarge) First of all, there is an argument to be made that it is testing some sort of support right now. It doesn't really precisely coincide with any of the Fib levels I've got on this chart, but it's there nevertheless, tested from below in 10/13, and tested from above in late March and late April of this year. Price blew through that in late May all the way to the .618 Fib line (leaving in doubt the relative strength or weakness of this support), but rebounded all the way to the 7/10 high. If that is the case, I would want to see it test that support (around .854) and go back through the .764 (which it is below now) with conviction and then perhaps test the .764 from above a couple of times to show. Naturally, if it finds substantial resistance at the .764 (around .858), then that is likely to portend a further decline, and the next test would be at the .618 (around .841). Also standing in the way is the 200 day MA, currently at .846, but this particular pair does not show a tendency to take that into consideration during movement. However, to some traders, a cross of this level would spell the end of the pair's bull run and have buyers running for the doors. Regardless of where exactly the bottom occurs, this is the visual picture I will be waiting to see on the 1H, a bullish 'Gator formation, followed by a cross of the 200 period MA: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Point in fact, this is what I would want to see just to start considering a long. Ideally, you would want to see this develop on the 1H and then see the same bullish 'Gator formation and the 200 period MA cross on higher time frames as well. I'd also be fine with the pair consolidating into and then oscillating about in a range, like it did between late October of last year and early February of this, largely between the .382 and the .618 Fib lines on the Daily: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If there's one thing I won't do, however, it is to call a bottom in the pair. Let the institutional traders do the heavy lifting and lose their shirts trying to do that. In the meantime, I'm standing aside.

EUR/AUD short executed. Upon reconsideration, deleting USD/JPY long. Here's why: I think the pair is constricted to a longer-term (and wider) range and that it is best to wait to buy "at the bottom of the box" (101.20-ish): Attached Image (click to enlarge) (This is what happens in a slow market; you get indecisive, reconsider positions, second-guess yourself ... . Damn, you slow markets).

You'll notice on the chart posted above, that the pair is slowly undergoing some constriction, apparently having greater and greater difficulty clearing the 200 period MA on the 8H, let alone making it to the top of the box ... . I assume that it will eventually break to the upside against the larger backdrop of Fed tapering and BOJ easing, however, ... eventually ... .

Right now, I'm watching EUR/JPY for a bounce/sell opportunity, but it is something that may just have to wait (at least for me) until tomorrow. The pair is currently testing the 1.272 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point line. While I am looking to short this pair, if you can have eyes on it (i.e., stare at your computer screen), it may be worth a very short-term breakout play if it clears the 1.272 and that line becomes support. My guess is that the reward would be 25 pips or so, as I would expect resistance at 137.25-ish (tested on 7/21 or 22). I thought about shorting at market right here, but resisted the urge ... .

New York Session Mid-Day EUR/CAD addition order executed.

Every so often I get caught in what I like to call a "dog." "Dogs" for me are trades that I have to hold longer than a few days to become net profitable, and this is looking like one of those. In one sense, they are kind of more "enjoyable" than a trade that you set up at the end of the New York session that hits the TP within a few hours, since they require more thinking about where the pair is going, where your additions should be, etc. Patience is key.

I've also been keeping an eye on USD/JPY. Previously I noted that it was in a long-term range, and that I preferred to buy at the low end of the box (around 101.2) as a range play. Now it appears that it may have some momentum behind it, having crossed the 1H 200 period MA and, since yesterday's New York close, the 6H 200 period MA. The only problem with that that I can see is that there may be some resistance to its moving significantly past the price it's currently at (102.10-ish), given the fact that there is a fairly long-term Fib level just a bit overhead (at about 102.23) which has shown to present resistance in the past: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It may be worth it at this point to buy on dips, targeting 102.56 (which would be the .50 Fib line) for the net position. This is plenty of pips to play with in my mind for my sort of trading. Something to ponder ... .

Why My EUR/CAD Short May be a Dumbass Play Short-Term Every so often (well, it seems like once weekly), I do something stupid, resulting in a "dog" trade. I naturally start to wonder whether I've made the right decision with a particular trade when it starts to look like a "dog," so I usually go back and ask myself what the hell I was thinking. Naturally, given multi-time frame analysis, I figured the pair would continue lower. It may do that eventually, but it is certainly not doing that in the short-term. Now that I look at it, EUR/CAD looks to be in a short-term range, and I probably couldn't have shorted at a worse spot (toward the bottom of the range): Attached Image (click to enlarge) My short-term stupidity aside, my longer-term sentiment on the pair remains bearish, since price is still below the 200 period MA on the 4H and 6H charts. However, it may be advisable to stand aside from adding to the position until I can see what the pair does with respect to resistance at the top end of the "box" (around 1.4615). I'd prefer we never get there, but nothing I say ever really seems to affect the way in which a pair will move (unfortunately).

New York Close EUR/CAD: I am equivocating as to whether to add a position here. I naturally want to take advantage of the bounce, especially if it is temporary, but don't want to do that if the pair is going to move higher. I am going to go out on a limb here and add a position if price hits the new .736. The other pairs I am considering are a GBP/JPY short for an extremely short term range play (it's just begging for pivot point treatment) and an AUD/USD long (which I am not particularly excited about; price has broken below the 200 period MA on the 1H, albeit in a slightly impulsive manner). I am still waiting for a EUR/USD bounce that I can take advantage of for a short, as well as a bottom in the Kiwi to take a long in NZD/USD or a short in GBP/NZD and/or EUR/NZD. That's probably going to be it, given my habit of trying to avoid doubling up on currencies -- got EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, and USD all represented in the open positions and in the entry orders.

End of New York Session Wow. We finally got some movement today, but unfortunately it was not in the direction of the three positions I've got open now. I added positions to the EUR/CAD short, the AUD/USD long, and the GBP/JPY short (for the EUR/CAD I did a market order (something I don't usually do, but since price was already at the 1 line, I went ahead and added the position); the AUD/USD long from the .236 and the GBP/JPY short additions from the .764 executed almost immediately). Naturally, I'm a little big concerned about the EUR/CAD short given the number of legs involved and its seemingly ceaseless movement upward since my first entry, and also because it has broken the 200 period MA on the 4H (even though it remains below that MA on the 6H). On a positive note, a sell for the pair has a positive swap, making a long-term hold while price sorts itself out not totally unattractive. Nevertheless, given where usable margin is at this point in time, having to hold onto this position for a period of time may impair other trades, since I do want to try to adhere to the &lt;10% total exposure rule (although that may prove hard to do, since I'm so close to that right now). In fact, I'm not going to consider any other pairs for trading until I get one of the open positions closed in net positive territory (which will probably take some patience). I previously noted that the top end of the "box" (the short-term range) for EUR/CAD was about 1.4615; we'll see if that holds up as resistance. Current Open Positions EUR/CAD Short (5 Legs) (2.86 x equity) at 1.45232/TP 1.45082 GBP/JPY Short (2 Legs) (1.14 x equity) at 173.491/TP 173.341 AUD/USD Long (2 Legs) (1.14 x equity) at 1.93553/TP 1.93703 Pivot Point Based Entry Orders None Usable Margin: 91.74%; Usable Maintenance Margin: 83.47% Current Leg Size .57 x equity (4k lots)

At some point in the near future, I am also going to be piddling about with a "Modified Grid System," described here with sufficient particularity for me to form ideas as to how to set it up and manage it effectively. http://www.forexrazor.com/en-us/scho...e-and-modified I'm always interested in trying new methodologies although, like all others, it is likely to have flaws. The one glaring one I can see is having a "dangling" trade that does not hit the next point in the grid before price retraces. It might dovetail nicely with pivot points, since the pivot point box would be an ideal area in which you would want to set up your grid. I am not sure exactly how I would deal with a dangling trade in light of FIFO rules, but that's naturally why I'll be piddling with the smallest possible lots to begin with. Because I want to continue what I've been doing with pivot points, I may limit that methodology to a single currency pair so I can keep track of its performance and how well it works (or doesn't).

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Real quick post: adding to open positions (none of which hit TP) as follows: AUD/USD long at the .236. GBP/JPY short at the .764. EUR/CAD short at the .764. No new positions due to my nearing 10% use of margin. I've begun to play with a "Modified Grid System," which I am probably going to combine with the pivot point system if trades using the grid result in a "dangling" trade, and I'll post about it here once I figure out how to work it best ... . I can already tell that a grid system is going to be comparative "fun" (if that is possible). This will keep me busy while my pivot point trades go on about their business. Looks like the GBP/JPY short is nearest its target, but it still has 28 pips to go. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Finally, GBP/JPY position closed for small profit: Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUD/USD long and EUR/CAD short still open and in the red, so they are now longer-term propositions, which is okay, since I've been playing around with grids for a bit with a little bit of success while those two trades resolve themselves. (Hope I'll be able to get the Mirror Trader Platform to load after work so I can show my equity curve for this week, as well as the grid trades; the equity curve graph is, in fact, the only thing I use that platform for anymore ... ; it loads halfway right now, but doesn't display anything ... ugh.) Point in fact, I actually gained more pips using the grid system this week than the pivot points (because I was stuck in those trades ... ).

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Well, I ended up doing okay this week and this month. For the week: 19 trades, 229 pips: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For the month: 89 trades, 1104.5 pips: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That being said, I now have two "dog" positions open -- the EUR/CAD short and the AUD/USD long. On a positive note, the Aussie recovered somewhat from its slump, but still has some ways to go to hit my TP. However, EUR/CAD continued to surge, mimicking the movement of USD/CAD and no doubt slightly aided by EUR/USD's bounce. Fortunately, these are relatively small positions percentage-wise, have good positive swap, and I can just leave them out there for the time being. I think AUD may be recovering, but EUR/CAD continues to surge, and I don't want to add anything more until it is obvious that it has turned a corner (it has not) (naturally, I've said that before, but added to the position anyways, like a total doof). I had been waiting for EUR/USD's bounce for some time in order to get a better short in, but was not set up to take advantage of it because I believed I was on the edge of overtrading and did not want to get into another position. Oh, well; I hope it will present a good opportunity to get shorts in going into next week. Toward the end of this week, I noted that I would start to look at so-called "modified" grid trading with small lots. I piddled around with a little bit at the end of the week due to boredom associated with having to wait for trades to hit their TP's. "Modified" grid trading is directional in nature (you only set up your grid on one side of price), as compared to traditional grid trading (where you set up your grid on both sides). You pick the direction of the trade (I will probably continue to use the 200 SMA on the 1 and 6H charts), and then set up your grid in the direction of the movement. Say, for example, your multi time frame analysis shows that EUR/USD is going to sink and price is currently at 1.34100. You set up your grid as follows: Sell at 1.34000, limit 1.33910 Sell at 1.33900, limit 1.33810 Sell at 1.33800, limit 1.33710 Etc., etc. So, price drops to 1.34000, the order executes, and then price drops further and the limit is hit at 1.33910 (9 pip gain). Price drops further, the 1.39000 sell order executes, and the price drops further and the limit is hit at 1.33810 (9 pip gain). The reason I put a small gap between the limit and the next order is to accommodate a little bit of slippage and/or spread to allow the limit order to execute before the next grid level is reached, if at all possible. More volatile pairs (like GBP/NZD and GBP/JPY) may require a bigger gap since they have a bigger spread. In any event, say the 1.33800 sell order executes, but price retraces before hitting the limit. This is a "dangling" trade. Naturally, you could set an SL, but I'm not a fan of that in light of the fact that you're only looking at 10 pips between levels. Rather, I would prefer not to use stops, but keep the limit order there as is, and wait. This is where FIFO sucks. If I didn't have FIFO, I could just set that particular trade aside, and continue trading in the pair, basically ignoring that one small, open position and let it go about its little business. Having FIFO requires me to address that one trade and either close it out, wait, or add to the position later. If I choose to add, I will probably employ the pivot point trading system I've described above to do that. Naturally, while I'm waiting for the pair to either hit its limit or present an opportunity to add a position, I'll have to move on to a grid with another currency pair and goof around with that for a while. As with the pivot point trading system, diversification remains key, lots should be small (&lt;.5 times equity), sides of pairs with negative swaps should be avoided, and having a great deal of patience may be required at times. Additionally, you do not want to be placed in a position of an overabundance of dangling trades at once. Once you reach two or three dangling trades that you have to wait on, you should probably stop grid trading. I cannot emphasize enough, in fact, that using extremely small position sizes for this system is critical, since I can contemplate having to stay in positions for days, weeks, and, in some limited cases, months. This is the kind of patience I'm talking about, taken from hayseed's "It's a small matter" thread: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Eight weeks to become net profitable in a USD/CAD trade; that is epic patience. One last thing to mention is how deep you will want to go with your grid. I don't really have the answer to that yet. You may want to go as deep as the last swing, a particular MA, a more robust pivot point or Fib level than the daily Fib retracement pivot points (the range of which can be quite narrow), and an obvious area of support/resistance.

I've got some messes to clean up for positions that were entered into last week. As previously noted, while I was waiting for my AUD/USD long, EUR/CAD short, and GBP/JPY short positions to clear, I piddled around with grids, which left me with a few dangling trades. Here's what I got open now: Open Positions (Pivot Point) EUR/CAD short at 1.45306/TP 1.45156 AUD/USD long at .93365/TP .93415 Open Positions (Grid) EUR/USD short at 1.33800/TP 1.33705 EUR/AUD short at 1.43746/TP1 1.43709; TP2 1.43603 EUR/NZD short at 1.57374/TP 1.57324 Usable Maintenance Margin: 89.59% Notes The EUR/AUD short grid opened one position (first grid entry) and then another (second grid entry) before hitting the first grid level's limit before it retraced. I obviously did not have the gap wide enough between the limit for the first grid entry and the next grid entry ... . The first grid entry limit was never hit ... . Live and learn. Also, the UMM is above where I would like it to be. This the first time I've had it over 10% in quite some time. Clearing a dangling trade or two, as well as either the AUD/USD long or the EUR/CAD short would get the UMM under 10%, which is what I'd prefer. Also, it is clear that I may need to tweak the lot size for grid trading; I first tried it with 3k lots (about .5 times equity), but I think I will be less stressed with 2k lots (about .25 times equity), since it is clear that I'm going to be left with dangling trades quite frequently. The object now is to work at clearing the dangling trades, as well as considering more robust additions to the AUD/USD long and the EUR/CAD short that use either Fib levels or standard S/R. New pivots form in about half an hour from now ... .

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Methodologies for Clearing Dangling Trades I've been giving some thought about the method I'm going to use for clearing dangling trades. Naturally one method is to simply do nothing with the position, take a wait and see attitude, and see if it hits the original limit without adding positions. One method would be to continue to use a grid in the direction of the original trade to add positions. Another would be to use something akin to the pivot point method to add positions. And yet another idea would be to look at the bigger picture, and add positions based upon traditional S/R, longer-term Fib levels, or something of that nature. I think it's largely going to depend upon what the chart looks like for the given pair ... .

--- 帖子 #126 ---
So here's what I'm going to do with the respective open positions: EUR/CAD short. Unfortunately, I've been chasing this thing up the ladder for several days, and it doesn't appear that it's yet prepared to turn over or, at least, doesn't show any signs of that occurring, so I'm going to stand aside from entering any more positions until it sorts itself out. (I know I've said that several times before ... , but have nevertheless added to it; impatience is not a good trait in this case ... ). AUD/USD long. I'm only going to add to this position if it hits an extreme price, that being about .928. It is sufficiently near its TP not to devote additional positions to it. EUR/USD, EUR/AUD, and EUR/NZD shorts. These were grid trades, and I really only want to take advantage of their bounces if they retrace. So I will set up a grid below current price, but it is likely to only have less than five levels to it, since there are only 50 pips between current price and my original entries in all three of these cases. So, here is the EUR/USD grid: Attached Image There aren't any limit prices because I've got an open position. Naturally, I'll want to change the target price for the net position should these additions execute, the object being to get out of the position net profitable. EUR/AUD short grid: Attached Image EUR/NZD short grid: Attached Image I may hunt around for an additional grid trade with extremely small lots, since I think that the system has a lot of tweaking that needs to be done (i.e., what lot size to use; what gap you should use between the limit of a particular grid level and the next entry, etc.).

--- 帖子 #127 ---
The modified grid trading system also has me thinking of an EA that would use grids. It would be nice, after all, to have an EA set up a grid when a price hits a certain level (like the daily Fib retracement 1 pivot point or R3 or something like that). Otherwise, you will have to watch the chart, wait for that level to hit, and then begin setting up your grid on the fly for the retracement ... .

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I keep on looking at NZD/USD. It appears short-term range-bound or in consolidation around .85 and appears hesitant to give up that level ... . Only time will tell, since I do want to long eventually ... .

Dont you think daily chart is a bear trap?EJ Weekly has a nice bullsih engulfing.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Truth be told, I'm not much of a candlestick guy; I'm a moving average guy, if anything. It's not that I don't think candlesticks can be useful, I just think that for me personally they don't really add anything to my analysis and can create indecision. The primary thing I look at with trade direction is the 200 period MA. 4H and above, price is below that moving average, so I regard the pair is bearish. There is also short-term resistance at the approximate level it's at now (which I am relying upon somewhat). Against the backdrop of Euro weakness, I am generally short the Euro on the vast majority of Euro pairs, this being no exception. Here I think 138.000 is the short-term cap on strength. Naturally, should it continue to drive upwards, orders in the directional grid below current price will in all likelihood not execute or will not execute deeply into the grid (fingers crossed) before a substantial, bullish retrace occurs.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Could the bullish engulfing be partly due to that impulsive movement on Thursday? (Confess I don't know the answer to this ... .)

Okay, I'm not very good at candlesticks, but I don't see a bullish engulfing on my weekly ... . In fact, it kinda looks like a doji ... . (I would note that the color might be off, since I use Heikin-Ashi): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This candle could be also a retest of area 138,000 so we could go lower but with EU changing trend now because i dont see it to going lower atm EJ could follow.Also this weekly is candle created from news (dont remember exaclly from what kind lol) and EJ opened with a bullish gap.

Thanks for that ... . My candles look kinda squashed ... . Well, the EUR/JPY executed the first grid order, hit the first limit, executed the second, but now appears in a bit of consolidation or is going sideways: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Early in the week, so we'll see how that goes.

Mac user. I can run Metatrader using PlayOnMac, but it is unstable and glitchy. I'll eventually get a Windows machine to trade on, which will make things a lot easier.

Kind of a drag, since I really like the Mac ... .

Cleared the EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD grid trades for an (extremely) small profit, and EUR/JPY ground through a couple levels of the grid before stalling out and retracing: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The Usable Maintenance Margin is now on the edge of where I would ordinarily want it to be, which is not more than 10%. The AUD/USD long is nearing its modest target price (designed to just clear the position net profitable so that I can clear the decks), and I don't think I'll be adding to it. EUR/CAD finally appears to have turned over. I will look at what I am going to do with that in a separate posting, since I want to chart it a little bit to see if I should continue to hang back from adding to it. Current Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.34000/TP 1.39910 (dangling grid trade) AUD/USD long at .93365/TP .93400 (pivot point trade, but have the TP set up so that I can run a grid to capture any bullish follow through if I choose to do that) EUR/JPY short at 137.499/TP 137.409 (dangling grid trade) EUR/CAD short at 1.45494/TP 1.45410 (pivot point trade, but set up for a follow-through grid (if it every gets near the TP)) Entry Orders/Grids EUR/USD (grid below current TP) EUR/JPY (grid below current TP) UMM: 90.05%

What to Do With the EUR/CAD Position 1H. Price on the 1H is above the 200 period MA (bullish). It has come off its early London session high, and is currently sitting at the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point 0 line. Typically the pair does not move a great deal in the Asian, so what it does in the next few hours probably will not be telling of what it is likely to do in the next London or New York session. 4H. Price on the 4H is above the 200 period MA (bullish). What is interesting here is that the pair appears to have been rangebound for a period of time between 1.464 and 1.445. The current problem is that price is now butting up against the upper end of the box, which could provide resistance for the pair: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily. Price on the daily is below the 200 period MA (bearish). However, there is an argument to be made that price has broken through a descending trend line (albeit by virtue of largely sideways motion). Weekly. Price on the weekly is above the 200 period MA (bullish). Ordinarily, I don't zoom out this far, but I wanted to see where the historical lows were for the pair and to draw a decent, long-term Fib line. You can see the pair has been on somewhat of a bull run dating back to August of 2012, that paused briefly between January and May of 2013, only to continue ripping higher. It is now below the .762 at 1.4772, but above the .618 at 1.4267. The slow stochastic (not shown) is decidedly bullish, but nearing the 80 line, indicating that there may be some bull left in it: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Monthly: Just for kicks, I did have a look at the Monthly (virtually a first for me). The low set on 8/2012 is historically significant, but doesn't help me make a decision here To a certain extent, none of this helps out much with an entry, except to indicate that I should wait, the concern being that the pair may be establishing a new range. Naturally, if the pair merely impulsively broke the range (as has been known to occur from time to time), it may be that once the pair breaks though the top of the box, it will continue lower and resume the range it has held since the end of June.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Any Other Pairs Ripe for a Grid? I am keeping an eye on USD/JPY and GBP/USD. Naturally, I wish I would have gridded USD/JPY long when it was around 101.25. I was long at that juncture (in mid-July), but bailed out early to lock in the gains (doofus). The pair has been ranging between just north of 101 and 102.7 or so for months, and it's at the top end of that range. I'm not sure I want to short it against the backdrop of BOJ easing and Fed tightening, so I'd like to see it dip more before considering a long. GBP/USD is another one I wish I would have gridded short when it was toward the top of its bull run. It has receded substantially since (and turned has turned bearish on everything below Daily), and I also bailed out of that early to lock in gains. It tested the 1.6817 level (the .236 line for the Fib from the 6/3 low to the 7/15 high), but I am unsure if it's going to resume its bull run, or continue downward in light of mixed UK data and fleeting expectations for a "sooner than later" rate hike. That being said, there are 50 odd pips to take advantage of from the 1 to the 0 line of the Fib Retracement Pivot Point box, so it might be worth it to set up a grid that is three to four levels wide starting with a sell entry about 10 pips below current price.

Otherwise, I will probably use the pivot points to add to the position at opportune moments. That EUR/CAD short just refuses to give up the ghost ... . Made more so far on the positive swap than the price movement (lol).

The grid trade returns are somewhat productive pip-wise, but the equity curve is a bit choppier than usual, probably because I have not been effectively exiting the dangling trades (or haven't been systematically doing so): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also, I haven't honed in a lot size that works for me yet. I think I am going to stick to &lt;.5 times equity for now and see how that works for cycling out of the dangling trades ... .

Still got eyes on the Kiwi ... . NZD/USD has retraced almost all of the gains it made between 6/3 and 7/9: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It appears as though that it might be shooting for .8400, which is when I might begin to consider a long (or shorts in GBP/NZD and EUR/NZD), as there is a confluence of support there (the .618 for the line from the 8/13 low to the 7/9 high): Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... not a fan of shorting Kiwi due to horrible negative swap ( FXCM currently quotes NZD/USD rollover as -1.11 on the sell side, .52 on the buy).

USD/JPY is kind of pissing me off ... . Well, not really. I'm more pissed off at myself for not holding my long that I entered at around the .5 Fib from the line drawn from the 10/13 low to the 1/14 high (slightly north of 101). This is because the S/R is so clean at that level, and it is not very clean where we're at now, making it hard to make a decision as to an entry: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It looks like there is short-term hesitancy to push beyond 103.00 and the slow stochastic makes it look like the air is slowly going out of its tires: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Best to keep an eye on it and wait for another opportunity to go long at the 101 or so ... . There may be also an opportunity at the 102 psych level, since that is confluent with the .618, but S/R is sloppy at that level ... . Fortunately, there are more interesting Yen cross pairs to dabble in.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Speaking of more interesting Yen crosses, I need only point to GBP/JPY, which has made a series of lower highs and lower lows since early July (although its most recent lowest low is basically a retest of the low set at the end of June, which it has not penetrated (around 172.38). This series of lower highs and lower lows is also reflected in a series of bear formations in the Alligator indicator: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm going to consider selling this on bounces with the TP being 172.38. There's not a huge amount of pippage between current price and that level, but plenty to play with for my purposes.

Actually, I think the GBP/JPY is worth setting up a directional grid: Attached Image

Coming up on the New York close ... . Current Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.33600 -- The grid below will be left in place. Currently there is a gap of about 17 pips between the entry price and the current price, so I will leave it alone. GBP/USD short at 1.68500 -- The grid below will be left in place. Currently there is a gap of about 35 pips between the entry price and the current price, so I will be adding to the position using the Fib Retracement Daily Pivot Points with a Good For Day entry order to short it at the .764. When and if that price executes, I will modify the target price to fit it above the current grid and add any grid levels between the new TP and the next grid level so that I can take full advantage of any further downward movement. EUR/JPY short at 137.099 -- The grid below will be left in place. Currently there is a gap of about 11 pips between the entry price and current price, so I will leave it alone. EUR/CAD short at 1.45594/TP 1.45510. I am going to add a position should price hit the .764 and will modify the TP should that order execute to fit the TP in with the grid below, which is set up beneath 1.45510 in the event that there is dramatic movement in connection with Canadian data later this week (Ivey PMI + Unemployment).

Actually had to set the GBP/USD short addition order at the 1 line, as price is now over the .764.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
FYI: Price hit one of the grid levels for the GBP/USD short, three for the EUR/USD short, and three for the EUR/JPY short (so far). These are basically 9 pip levels, so that's a total of 7 levels x 9 pips each, for 63 pips total.

Well, last night's action ripped through the entirety of my EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY short grids, and most of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD short grids. Both EUR/USD and GBP/USD have retraced somewhat, as have EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD (after setting up the short grid in GBP/NZD, I decided to set up one in EUR/NZD after the Kiwi fireworks had settled near the top of their trajectory). At any rate, it looks like (of all the grids that were set up), 56 grid levels in total were blown through for a total of 519 pips (a one day personal best for me): Attached Image (click to enlarge) I still have a few levels in place for EUR/USD and GBP/USD, as well as for GBP/NZD and that pesky EUR/CAD, should price ever hit my modest TP. Here's what I've got open now: EUR/USD short at 1.33400 (grid trade): There is a 40 pip gap between current price and the entry price. I will fashion an entry order to sell the pair should price hit the current .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point. Should that execute, I will modify the TP to fit in with the remaining grid below and add grid levels if there is room between the new TP and the next level. Grid levels are currently set all the way down to 1.3300. GBP/USD short at 1.68299 (grid trade): The position is doubled up, since two grid level sell orders executed before a grid level limit was reached (probably when it was ripping down). TP is altered for the two positions to a single TP at 1.68210. There is a 25 pip gap between current price and the entry price. I will fashion an entry order to sell the pair should price hit the current .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point. I have deleted the remainder of the grid, because there appears to be some hesitancy to move beyond 1.68200 for the time being. EUR/NZD short at 1.57600 (grid trade): There is a 37 pip gap between current price and the entry price. However, due to yesterday's movement, I am going to leave the pair alone for now. There are no grid levels below; price blew through all my levels last night, and I am not going to add any here due to apparent resistance right where the open position limit is located. GBP/NZD short at 1.98596 (grid trade). There is a 33 pip gap between current price and the entry price. However, due to yesterday's movement, I am going to leave the pair alone for now. Grid levels are currently set all the way down to 1.9800. EUR/CAD short at 1.45690/TP 1.45610 (pivot point trade). I have fashioned an entry order to short the pair should price hit the .764, thus adding to the position. Should that execute, I will modify the TP to fit in with the remaining grid below and add grid levels if there is room between the new TP and the next level. Grid levels are currently set all the way down to 1.4450. I am beginning to be interested in going USD/JPY long, but given today's impulsive price action, I will probably hold off on that for another day. What is likely to be most interesting this evening is AUD employment data. If last night's Kiwi data is any indication, there will be fireworks with AUD crosses in a little less than three hours time. I usually stand aside from potentially market moving data events, but the aftereffects of the data could present opportunities for me to buy the pair at a better price ... .

Also, Usable Maintenance Margin is at 88.27%, so I am in fairly good shape there. Higher than I'd like, but not totally out of control ... . Would be enormously happy to get that oversized EUR/CAD short out of the way, though. Still hoping for CAD strengthening Ivey and employment data in the next couple of days ... .

--- 帖子 #163 ---
In addition to stalking a good buy opportunity in NZD/USD, I'm stalking a similar thing with AUD/USD. I think that I prefer .92 as an entry point for a long because it is the .50 Fib drawn from the 10/13 high to 1/14 low and because it has at least been tested a couple of times in both early and late May: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The pair is also arguably in a fairly long-term range here between .92 and .95, and I'd prefer to take a long at the bottom of the range or at least to examine PA at that level: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Naturally if it tanks after tonight's data, that might set up a nice buy opportunity. However, it is difficult to see how they can miss so small a target: they're only forecasting 13.5K. However, the devil's in the details; last time's overall numbers were better than forecast. However, the previous report's data was revised downward, making for a "mixed" report. Price initially embraced the positive details of the report, but then, upon examination, shrugged off its significance, eventually returning to its pre-report levels: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... all in all 95 pips from head to toe ... .

Setting up GBP/AUD short grid from 1.815 down to 1.802 in 10 pip increments with 1 pip gap between limit and next level ... .

--- 帖子 #165 ---
In winding down the week, I decided to delete out the remainder of the GBP/NZD and EUR/NZD grids to allow those to wind down and close out, which they did. EUR/USD also hit a couple of levels and a EUR/AUD short grid I set up at the same time as the GBP/AUD short also hit a level. Not as good as Tuesday, but pretty much fun nevertheless: Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP/AUD has done very little, which is disappointing ... . Current Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.33400 (grid trade). Price currently 22 pips above entry. Will add position should price hit the .764, modify TP on net position to fit into the grid, and change the grid below should there be room for another level. The grid below all the way down to 1.33100 remains in place. GBP/USD short at 1.68299 (grid trade). Price currently 4 pips above entry. So close, so ain't gonna do squat. The grid below all the way down to 1.68000 remains in place. EUR/CAD short at 1.45680/TP 1.45610 (pivot point trade + grid below TP). Price currently 35 pips above entry. Will add position should price hit the .764, modify TP on net position to fit into the grid, and change the grid below should there be room for another level. The grid below all the way down to 1.44600 remains in place. I would note that price wicked down earlier in the day and grabbed one of the grid levels below without hitting the net position's TP before retracing (oh, so close; the ask low was 1.4562). GBP/AUD short at 1.81433 (grid trade). Price currently 20 pips above entry. Price is currently above the .764, so I'm not going to fashion an entry order to sell at the .764 right now. I'll check back in on the pair later for that, but am going to add a few grid levels back in place at and below 1.8140 and all the way down to 1.8110, which would be reasonable for a retrace. Naturally, there may be some movement in AUD later in the evening due to the upcoming RBA statement ... . Entry Orders I am not particularly hot to enter into a bunch of stuff going into the end of the week, but I'll go through the charts and see what may be attractive, even if I don't opt to partake ... . The other consideration is my UMM which is at 86.56%, which remains somewhat higher than I normally have it. I'll post those separately.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I scrolled through my charts, and nothing in particular interests me; I'm already in EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EUR/CAD, and GBP/AUD, so the logical place for me to look would be at Yen crosses. Naturally, AUD may become substantially interesting later in the evening, but it is doing very little now as traders await the RBA ... . Unfortunately, while I was goofing around with NZD and AUD crosses, I missed excellent opportunities to take another short dip with both EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY on bounces. USD/JPY bounced as well, but not nearly enough to present an interesting opportunity. I considered going short in USD/JPY, but the 1H and 6H currently conflict; I'd rather wait until my longer term 101.25 play. EUR/JPY would have been an excellent short pivot point play from the .764 to the .263 (about 42 pips if my measurement is correct). GBP/JPY never did hit the .764, but if you could have had eyes on the pair, you could have set a grid below the top out and netted 20-30 pips with minimal effort.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
And now, I am cursing myself even more for overlooking that EUR/JPY short yesterday ... . It's now penetrated 136.00 ... . One thing I am sure of ... . It will be there next week.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I've decided to start preparing for the weekend. (Woot!) Wherever possible, I like to be out of all the week's trades by New York close so I don't have to think about things over the weekend. With that in mind, I've deleted all my grids and (fingers crossed), hope that my remaining positions close out nicely (fingers crossed ... fingers crossed ... fingers crossed ... ). ... Don't like to get greedy on Friday ... .

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Closed out GBP/USD short grid for miniscule profit, leaving me with three open trades leading up to the weekend, the EUR/CAD short, the EUR/USD short, and the GBP/AUD short. I am fairly confident that both the EUR/CAD and EUR/USD shorts will hit their modest TP's. The GBP/AUD short's closing out before the weekend is likely to be problematic; AUD appears to be in somewhat of a nosedive at the moment ... .

--- 帖子 #170 ---
GBP/AUD hit its modest price target ... . Now down to a EUR/USD short position and that pesky EUR/CAD short (with the good swap ... ). I might have mentioned this guy before, but he's worth a book mark I think so that you can see what his systems are doing: https://twitter.com/Break_Retrace3 One of his systems has just bought EUR/JPY "seeing signs of basing at major support." Me, I'm not there yet for that pair. Plus it's Friday ... .

--- 帖子 #171 ---
A great week (but for that EUR/CAD short which I'm still holding): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Other than that, I probably got a bit off track this week playing with the grids, but they worked out well in the end. Naturally, the priority remains to dump the EUR/CAD short at the earliest opportune moment this coming week, but CAD weakness is preventing that from happening and the EUR rebound from its lows also assisted with EUR/CAD's not hitting the now extremely modest target price. Nevertheless, with good positive swap, I can hold onto the position for a good deal of time without feeling too bad about it (although it requires more patience than I'd really like to give to the position). The only other position I've got open is a EUR/USD short, which I am not particularly concerned about. For me, the bounce is another selling opportunity for the pair, although we could see some sideways movement as the pair sorts out the level at which it's comfortable. Have a good weekend!

Going into next week, this what I'm going to be looking at: EUR/USD . The pair may be in consolidation mode with price capped at around 1.35. http://www.forexminute.com/technical...e-bottom-41092 I maintain a bearish sentiment on the Euro generally and believe that any consolidation is likely to be temporary against the backdrop of ECB easing and Fed tightening. So in the near term, I am going to sell bounces. EUR/JPY . Like EUR/USD, EUR/JPY may embrace into a consolidative frame of mind, but is poised to break significantly lower. http://www.forexminute.com/technical...ine-2012-41029 For this reason, EUR/JPY's bounce toward 137.00 may present an excellent selling opportunity going into the new week. Like EUR/USD, I am also going to sell bounces in this pair. USD/JPY . Absent something earthshaking, I maintain a generally bullish sentiment for the dollar in light of Fed tightening and kind of neutral sentiment with respect to the BOJ, which appears hesitant (or just plain slow) to ease further. As previously posted here, USD/JPY appears to be in a long-term range, the bottom of which is around the 101.25 level, which is where I would start seriously looking at buys. For the time being, I am going to wait for price to settle or, if I can antsy, buy dips. GBP/USD . I am in a bit of a quandary with respect to Cable. On time frames shorter than the Daily, it appears to be in bearish mode, but price is still above the Daily's 200 period SMA. But the 4H makes it looks like the pair is in a free fall. Nevertheless, there appears to be some possible support coming up at the .764 Fib for the line drawn from the 7/2013 low to the 7/2014 high (1.6638), and that is not all that far away -- a mere 50 pips or so. While I remain bullish on the dollar because of Fed tightening, the BOE appears clearly far more itchy to pull the trigger on interest rate hikes than the U.S. -- at least if we listen to Carney ... . If there anything is indicative of the fact that this pair may have a bit more bear left in it, it is that it experienced none of the bounce that EUR/USD experienced today ... . Sell bounces for now. GBP/JPY . Like GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, at least on lower time frames, presents a bit of connundrum. Today, it appears to have just whipped around just south of where it droppped at the end of Thursday's New York session. Although it has paused temporarily, I think it is possible that it could plunge all the way to 169.50-170.00, where there is obvious support (169.56 is the 5/29 low and also the April low). In the way, however, is the .236 Fib for the line drawn from the 5/29 low to the 7/4 high, a level it wicked to today. Sell bounces for this pair, too. AUD/USD . Although I am getting old(er), I seem to recall that not too long ago the RBA was bandying about the notion of a rate hike. I was somewhat shocked to learn that the possibility of a rate cut was actually being batted back and forth among pundits, in spite of RBA's saying that it will hold the line as to rates for now. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-0...-tensions.html (traders revive bets that RBA will cut interest rates in light of recent lackluster employment data). That being said, I am only interested in AUD long due to onerous swaps associated both with the Aussie and with its neighbor's currency, the Kiwi, and expressed the notion earlier in the week that .92 was a good place to start looking. If price doesn't get there, however, I won't be unduly disappointed; GBP/AUD (short) and EUR/AUD (short) present more than ample opportunities to take advantage of AUD strength should it present itself. Since we're not there yet, I am going to wait on trading this pair for now. NZD/USD . The pair is on the fringes of testing .84, which is what I have said would take me to even consider going long in this pair. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with this moron at Nomura cited in the Bloomberg article that you should go long dollar with either NZD/USD or AUD/USD as a long-term proposition. Apparently he is oblivious to the swaps associated with shorting either AUD or NZD. As with AUD, I gravitate toward other NZD crosses than NZD/USD as a matter of taste. Like with AUD/USD, I am going to wait for a long opportunity below current price. Although GBP/NZD is not for the faint of heart (it is more of a "widow maker" than GBP/JPY in my opinion), it is fairly easy to scalp 20-50 pips off the pair any given day, assuming you are correct as to direction. With the pair's having recently tested 2.0000, I look for it to revisit that level in order to set up another short. Wait for a retest of 2.0000 The less jumpy EUR/NZD appears to be right at resistance now (at about 1.586) and appears to beg for a short, although naturally caution should be exercised since NZD/USD has yet to test that .84 level. Sell bounces. USD/CAD . It is possible that a double top is forming at or near its current level. That being said, CAD has expressed a good deal of weakness lately and may be poised to move higher given relative dollar strength and the fact that significant CAD data that could return some strength to the Loonie will be absent for quite some time. I don't generally trade this pair specifically, but this could prove interesting in other CAD crosses. Wait for the double top to form.

A couple good articles that are worth reading to add to the "tool box", both of which deal with trading "opening ranges." http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technic...0000000Nc3RAAS http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/educati...ange-Bias.html I confess I don't really consider opening ranges in my trading, but they could come in handy to guide the setting up of directional grids. Point in fact, the strategy is a breakout strategy, with the trigger being the break of a particular time frame's opening low or high. Although there appears to be no clear rule of thumb as to how long to wait for the Weekly OR to establish itself (the 1H chart example appears to show more than 1 day's worth of candles) or for the Monthly OR to do the same (3-5 days is recommended), in shorter time frames the example given for trading session opening ranges is to use the first three 30 minute candles to determine the opening range. Naturally, if you're later in the month or week, the OR for the week or month will pretty much be "I know it when I see it" sort of thing.

To a certain extent, though, the use of certain pivot points mimics this approach, although it keys off the previous time period's price action ... . For example, the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points are established using the previous trading day's high and low, with the 1 line being the previous day's high and the 0 line being the low; the Weekly Daily Fib Retracement pivot points would also reference the previous week's high and low ... . (Camarilla Pivot Points also use the previous period's price action to establish pivot points).

Major Pair Multi Time Frame Analysis As you know, one of the first things I generally do to look at trade direction is to compare the 1H 200 SMA with the 6H 200 SMA. If price is below both, I look to sell; if above, I look to buy; and if the two disagree, I generally stay out of trading that particular pair unless other characteristics are present that would make me want to enter a trade (e.g., near top/bottom of longer-term range). So, here's where the major's are at right now with respect to their 1H and 6H 200 SMA's, with pairs showing consistency of direction between the two time frames highlighted: EUR/USD Above/Below GBP/USD Below/Below AUD/USD Below/Below NZD/USD Below/Below USD/CAD Above/Above USD/JPY Below/At or Near EUR/JPY Below/Below GBP/JPY Below/Below EUR/AUD Above/At or Near GBP/AUD Below/At or Near EUR/NZD Above/Above GBP/NZD Below/Above Naturally, this isn't the end of the inquiry, but it helps me kind of cull out some pairs that are equivocating as to direction or that I'll have to look at more closely if the 1H and 6H disagree. For example, I may want to look at an even higher time frame than 6H to see if the pair may be testing a top or bottom and whether I should look at a range trade that won't necessarily agree with the price's relationship to the 1H 200 SMA or the 6H 200 SMA. EUR/NZD is a good example of this. It may be topping out short-term, and I may want to scalp a few pips off of that if that is the case, even though that move would disagree with the multi time frame analysis. Moreover, due to the onerous spread associated with going short AUD or NZD, I only want to look at AUD or NZD longs, so even though EUR/NZD is Above/Above, AUD/USD Below/Below, and NZD/USD Below/Below, I don't really want to go long EUR/NZD, short AUD/USD, or short NZD/USD. In any event, half hour to Aussie open ... .

Aussie Open Current Open Positions EUR/USD Short at 1.33599/TP 1.33449 EUR/CAD Short at 1.45812/TP 1.45666 Entry Orders EUR/USD Good for Day Entry Order to Sell at 1.34108 EUR/NZD Short Grid from 1.5830 Down to 1.5760 EUR/JPY Short Grid from 136.80 Down to 136.10 USD/JPY Long Grid from 102.20 to 103.40 UMM: 86.76% Notes The entry orders are the ones that seem interesting to me as of right now. I considered a pivot point entry for a GBP/USD short, but there appears to be support a little bit below price right now, and we could see a bounce off of that that presents a more attractive sell opportunity. For the same reason, GBP/JPY looks a little bit unattractive, although perhaps even more so, since it has been moving somewhat sideways for the past 20 hourly candles or so. I also like EUR/AUD, but I want to wait a little bit on that. The pair was range-bound for several months (during which I traded the crap out of it from the "top of the box"). It has recently broken out of that range, and I want to see whether it returns to that range or establishes a new one: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also took a EUR/CAD market short to capitalize on the height of current price (between the 1 and .764 lines). I was hoping to patient enough to wait longer for a more favorable USD/JPY entry more toward 101.25. However, I think I've decided that this is going to be somewhat of a long-term play and that I should either buy and hold or just use a grid and see how it goes.

An afterthought on CAD/JPY ... . I used to trade the crap out of this pair, but moved on to other things. Having committed to the EUR/CAD short, however, has drawn my attention back to CAD in general and caused me to look at CAD/JPY once again: Attached Image (click to enlarge) To me, it doesn't look like it is necessarily ripe for a trade right now other than a short-term scalp to the downside. That being said, a reversal might arguably be on the horizon as it approaches the .236 Fib drawn from the 1/14 high to the 3/14 low. This would be in the vicinity of the 92.70, which isn't that far away. Moreover, the RSI on the Daily touched and bounced off the 30, which may indicate that sellers are beginning to take profit as that .236 Fib level approaches. In comparison, the Slow Stochastic indicates a lack of any directional enthusiasm to the upside. However, I would also not get excited about going long at the .236 if the pair shows no inclination to reverse in light of recent lackluster CAD data. CAD data that could arguably strengthen the Loonie appears to be somewhat thin for the next couple of weeks, so it's entirely possible that the pair will hesitate and move sideways at the aforementioned level before data, favorable or otherwise, moves it. This level, after all, has proven to be of some significance for the pair, its having tested it several times between mid-April and late May. Similarly, the .382 has proven to be a somewhat formidable level of resistance for the pair when below: it wobbled just south of this border in late May to early June before hesitantly penetrating it and heading higher.

Ugh. Carney's on tap to blather this week on Wednesday (a bunch of Cable data out that day will no doubt, in itself, move GBP all over the place). I generally stand aside from Cable until his stench clears the room, which may not be until late in the week or even early next week. Naturally, should his claptrap drive Cable higher, I'll be there to pounce on the opportunity ... .

Unfortunately, there generally wasn't a great deal of movement in the open positions I've got in EUR/USD (short), EUR/JPY (short), USD/JPY (long), EUR/NZD (short), and EUR/CAD (short) to either grind up the grids I've got in place or hit the TP's I've established. EUR/JPY ground through two of the grid levels; EUR/NZD, one, and price hasn't changed much in the rest of the open positions throughout the day, with most of the grid trade positions being within 20 pips of the entry price. That being said, the oversized EUR/CAD short made constructive progress toward its TP, with the pair shaving off more than 75 pips from its 8/8 high of 1.4736, with price breaking the 200 SMA on the 1H. Open Positions/Additions EUR/USD short at 1.33599/TP 1.33510 (grid in place from 1.335 down to 1.330): Current price is 26 pips over entry; good for day short entry order is fashioned to add position at the .764. Should it execute, TP will be adjusted to fit in with grid below, and grid positions added if room permits. USD/JPY long at 102.20 (grid in place from 102.30 up to 102.90): Current price is 3 pips under entry; no action is taken. EUR/JPY short at 136.599 (grid in place from 136.50 down to 136.10): Current price is 18 pips over entry; good for day short entry order is fashioned to add to the position at the .764. Should it execute, TP will be adjusted to fit in with grid below, and grid positions added if room permits. EUR/CAD short at 1.45812/TP 1.45762: Current price is 49 pips over entry; no action is taken given the unlikelihood that price will strike the .764. EUR/NZD short at 1.58100/TP 1.58010 (grid in place from 1.580 down to 1.576 is deleted): Current price is 23 pips over entry; good for day short entry order is fashioned to add to the position at the .764. Should it execute, TP will be adjusted to + 15 pips. I am deleting the grid below to close out the position should it hit the next level in order to reduce overall equity exposure. Because I am exposed quite a bit (more than I would usually like), I'm not particularly interested in opening any other positions in other pairs. With Cable in particular, I think I will wait until later in the week to see what transpires after Carney speaks and GBP data is laid out on the table. While I could continue to trade GBP crosses until then, GBP/USD, for example, was virtually lifeless throughout today's New York session meaning that it is not a particularly attractive trading set-up in any event.

I always love these "over the top" prognostications ... . http://www.efxnews.com/story/25598/u...s-late-12-citi I can understand 103.00, even 104.00, but 105 and 110 as targets? A rally through 103.14 would be a decent short term break while the more important medium term level is still the double bottom neckline at 104.13. A rally through there if/when seen would suggest a move up to 107.50. In line with this view, Citi maintains 2 long USD/JPY positions targeting 105+ and 11o with stops at 99.75 &amp; 100.50 respectively. And the stops ... almost aren't stops at all ... . 100.50 is more than 150 pips below where price is at right now; the 99.75 even more ... . Guess they must be playing with other people's money ... .

A real quicky post here ... .

EUR/JPY short at 136.400 (grid in place down to 136.00): Current price is 35 pips over entry; good for day short entry order is fashioned to add to the position at the .764. Should it execute, TP will be adjusted to fit in with grid below, and grid positions added if room permits. EUR/CAD short at 1.45812/TP 1.45762: Current price is 27 pips over entry; good for day short entry order is fashioned to add position at the .764. Should it execute, TP will be adjusted to +10 pips (really want to close this position up; been holding it for more than a week -- unusual for me). EUR/NZD short at 1.58244/TP 1.58144: Current price is 34 pips over entry; good for day short entry order is fashioned to add to the position at the .764. Should it execute, TP will be adjusted to + 10 pips. Like yesterday, I remain exposed quite a bit, so I'm not particularly interested in opening any other positions in other pairs. Naturally, I'll look at Cable pairs post-Carney to see if anything looks attractive there. GBP/USD bounced a little bit today; ordinarily, I would probably want to take advantage of that with a pivot point based short, but with Cable data coming up tomorrow, I think I'll stand aside for now. CAD may experience some gyrations between today and Friday; it appears that July employment data may have been mucked up and will need to be revised. Announcement of this revised data should occur some time on Friday. http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php...29#post7669700 (Has me on the edge of my seat ... .)

Finally closed out EUR/CAD short for an extremely small profit (but also a good bit of positive rollover): Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... which I'm kinda glad I did because it took a bounce from the bottom of its trajectory (after this screenshot was taken).

Sometimes "oops" trades end well ... . For example, I mistakenly left part of EUR/CAD's short grid in place before closing out the open position for a small gain (.6 pips plus the good positive swap). Well, the trade executed, and I came home to close it out at market for a 32 pip gain ... . Nice ... : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Oh, were I not to have closed the oversized position out last night ... . Also, the EUR/NZD short hits its TP in the early New York session, and USD/JPY ground through one more grid level in the early London:

Well, looking over the charts, it looks like this was one of those days I wish I didn't have a day job, since there was good movement in both Cable crosses and the Euro ... . I mean, look at the GBP/AUD chart (GBP/NZD has a similar trajectory): Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... Would have been perfect for a grid trade set up from around the 200 hour SMA ... . Oh, well, can't catch everything ... . In any event, here's what I've got left for open positions: Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.35568 (grid trade) (grid in place down to 1.3260): price is currently 7 pips above entry price. No action will be taken. (I think the order to add to the position at the .764 executed, thus changing the net position price, so I moved the TP to fit into the grid at 1.35510 and inserted an additional level or two where there was room in the grid). USD/JPY long at 102.501 (grid trade) (grid in place up to 103.50): price is currently 8 pips below entry price. No action will be taken. EUR/JPY short at 136.577 (grid trade) (grid in place down to 136.10): price is currently 32 pips above entry price. An entry order will be fashioned to sell the pair should price strike the .764, at which time the target price will be adjusted to fit into the grid, and grid levels added if there is room. New Positions I've been waiting until after today's Cable announcements to wade back into GBP crosses. However, the price action appears to be impulsive, so I'll naturally want to let things settle for a few days before considering a Cable cross play. In all likelihood, I will continue to short Cable, but GBP/USD isn't necessarily the best pair to do that with (GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD make for dramatic, explosive movement, which is not only productive if you have the direction correct, is incredibly fun to watch as price explodes through your grid ... .) AUD/USD really never did test the .9200 level (which is what I was waiting for), and I want to wait until NZD/USD retests the .8400 area before entering another NZD cross. NZD/USD appears to be moving sideways in the short term between about .8425 and .8490 (which is plenty of room for my smash and grab way of doing things), but it's also unclear to me whether NZD may settle into a range around the level it's currently at or break even further to the downside.

The EUR/USD short position consisting of a grid level trade and a .764 sell, hit its profit target late last night: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Other than that, the trading day was fairly uneventful for the positions I've got open. Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.33500 (grid trade) (grid in place down to 1.3260): price is currently 17 pips above entry price. An entry order will be fashioned to sell the pair should price strike the .764, at which time the target price will be adjusted to fit into the grid, and grid levels added if there is room. USD/JPY long at 102.601 (grid trade) (grid in place up to 103.50): price is currently 15 pips below entry price. An entry order will be fashioned to buy the pair should price strike the .236, at which time the target price will be adjusted to fit into the grid, and grid levels added if there is room. EUR/JPY short at 136.731 (grid trade) (grid in place down to 136.10): price is currently 24 pips above entry price. An entry order will be fashioned to sell the pair should price strike the .764, at which time the target price will be adjusted to fit into the grid, and grid levels added if there is room. New Positions As with yesterday, I am not incredibly excited about anything I see. Cable did virtually jack diddly squat today. After dropping yesterday, GBP/USD has spent the entire day in an extremely narrow range. I am still not excited about the possibility of taking an AUD long or NZD long at current levels. AUD/USD never really did test .9200 (and maybe it won't), which is where I would want to go long. NZD/USD nearly tested .8400, after which it bounced higher somewhat; I was screwing around with other things and missed a buy on the dip. Additionally, a lot of air has been let out of GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD's tires; I would prefer GBP/NZD reinflate toward 2.000 and that GBP/AUD be at 1.8100 +. Similarly, I missed the EUR/AUD short boat somewhat, and EUR/NZD appears to be right at support -- 1.575-ish. As you may know, I only like AUD and NZD long due to positive swap/rollover. I considered the possibility of returning to some sort of CAD pair, but the concern there is the revised July 2014 Canadian employment numbers due out tomorrow. The revised report presents somewhat of an unusual circumstance. A July 2014 number was already disseminated with accompanying market reaction. Now, however, we may get a completely different number before the Loonie has settled, causing unusual movement in Loonie pairs. Given the fact that tomorrow is Friday, I don't see a huge point in diving into a CAD trade given the circumstances.

Have I Changed My System Entirely? In mid to late June, when I first started using pivot points to enter and exit trades, that's all I did and that's all I settled for. In looking back at the charts, though, I found I was potentially missing a good deal of follow-through beyond the pivot point TP's, especially where a longer-term trend was in play. This kind of ticked me off. So, at the beginning of August, I started using directional grids, thinking that this would be a peachy way to catch movement that had been identified using multiple time frame analysis for the pivot point method and that, in the event of a dangling grid trade, I would use the pivot points to add to the dangling trade position and modify the net position to fit into the grid. Ultimately, it now kind of looks like I'm primarily using directional grids, with the pivot points as an afterthought to make sensible additions to positions resulting from dangling grid trades. Naturally, we'll have a look at the stats at the end of the month to see how well this is working. Has Average Profitable Trade (APT) increased? What's profit factor like? (This is why I wish I had a Windows machine and could set up a Trade Explorer; the TE would do all the work for me ... . Guess that's what I'm going to ask for for my birthday ... .) Happy trading!

Week's Results Here's the equity curve for the week: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That big hump at the front is due to that oversized EUR/CAD short position I closed out for nearly breakeven for the net position. Of the total 657.6 pips gains, 543 were due to various positions taken in EUR/CAD some of which were grid trades and some of which were pivot point trades; in a nutshell, a "fierce hot tranny mess." I guess the lesson there is: don't switch systems once you're into a trade. Stick to the system you started with respect to that trade ... . The week was otherwise fairly ho-hum, with about 114 pips gained aside from the EUR/CAD trade.

EUR/USD Outlook The long-term outlook on EUR/USD shows it coming up against resistance at the .5 Fib line drawn from the 7/13 low to the 5/14 high at about 1.3370: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Because I remain long-term bearish on the EUR/USD (against the backdrop of USD tightening and ECB easing), my bet is that this resistance will not hold for long, but has faked traders out with numerous false breakouts below this level. The pair appears to be in a short-term range, with the floor being 1.3330 and the ceiling being 1.3425: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For my part, I am going to continue to short the pair on bounces.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
GBP/USD Outlook GBP/USD is a somewhat more complicated matter than EUR/USD. From a fundamental standpoint, the BOE stands on the cusp of raising interest rates, but recent data has caused Carney to backtrack on his mid-June "sooner than later" statements, leaving in doubt the timing of such an event. Looking at the weekly, there is long-term support at the .764 running from the July 2013 low to the mid-July 2014 high (at about 1.663): Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see by the chart, this is historic S/R; the pair has tested it from below on several occasions (11/2009, 4/2011, 8/2011) and hesitated below that level earlier this year before driving through it on its way to the July 2014 high. Drilling down to lower time frames, the pair is butting heads with the 200 period SMA on the daily (currently at about 1.667), but I am going to keep an eye on that 1.663 level before committing to a direction, since we're so close to that level now.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
USD/JPY Outlook If you enjoy range trading, then this is a pair you should be looking at. It has been locked in a narrow range since mid-April and seems hesitant to move higher: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The floor is about 101.15; the ceiling, 102.76-ish. Against the backdrop of Fed tightening and BOJ easing, I am generally bullish on the pair, but prefer buying opportunities toward the low end of this range, where possible. Naturally, you'll want to keep an eye out for the psychologically important 103 level is see whether a breakout is in the making, but on the two occasions earlier this year when the pair broke above that level, follow-through was shallow and fleeting in spite of the fact that the 2014 high is 105-ish.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
AUD/USD Outlook Rather surprisingly, AUD/USD -- like USD/JPY, appears to be locked in a range between .9220 and .9470: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Because of the negative swap associated with shorting the pair, I am only interested in taking longs in the Aussie and would prefer doing so more toward .9220. From a fundamental standpoint, I am bullish on the USD, but in the past AUD/USD has displayed an occasional disconnect with USD strength or weakness, no doubt primarily because its ties with Mainland China are more substantial than those with the U.S., so it reacts more heavily to P.R.O.C. data than to USD data. Additionally, like the BOE, the RBA appears itchy to raise or normalize interest rates, with lukewarmly positive to negative Aussie data standing in the way of that. Ultimately, I am going to wait for an opportunity to buy the pair more toward .9220 ... .

--- 帖子 #195 ---
NZD/USD Outlook The Kiwi is another currency for which I am waiting for a good long opportunity due to swap. Like the Aussie, I am waiting for a particular level to be tested, and in the case of the Kiwi-Greenback, it is around .8415 (the .618 Fib from the 8/13 low to the 7/14 high; tested on 6/4/14): Attached Image (click to enlarge) With its recent bounce upward, I may be waiting for a while or will have to turn my attention to other Kiwi crosses (such as EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD) to get a piece of NZD action.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
EUR/JPY Outlook If you look at EUR/JPY's weekly chart, you'll easily recognize that the pair was on a bullish tear between July of 2012 and the end of last year, but that it is ripping no longer: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In fact, it appears to be slowly deflating, something that is evident on the 6H: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will continue to short the pair on bounces until such time as the pair approaches 136.35-ish, as that is a level the pair tested back in February. The pair attempted to break 1.36 on 8/8, but did not follow through lower.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
USD/CAD Outlook Point in fact, I don't trade the Loonie a great deal. Every so often, however, Loonie crosses get interesting, and this might be one of those times. Currently on the Daily, USD/CAD is near the .618 Fib line from the 9/13 low to the March 2014 high (around 1.0863), with CAD having experienced some strength due to revised employment data that came out on Friday: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This level has proved to be quite reliable support, although price didn't express much hesitation in breaking through this level on a dip between mid-June and mid-July. The problem for me with CAD is that data has been wildly inconsistent and forecasting appears to miss the mark more often than not. Fundamentally, I view USD from a bullish perspective, but view the Canadian economy has more sluggish in terms of improvement as compared to its neighbor to the south, leaving me temporarily neutral on the Loonie, but slightly bullish on the pair. That being said, other Loonie crosses may provide more attractive opportunities because greater polarities exist between the BOC's monetary policy and the monetary policy of the opposing currency than those that exist between the Greenback and the Loonie (for example, EUR/CAD or CAD/JPY).

--- 帖子 #198 ---
EUR/CAD Outlook EUR/CAD is at something of a crossroads. Price is currently smack dab at the .5 Fib drawn from the September 2013 low to the March 2014 high (around 1.4619) and with overwhelming evidence of Euro weakness in the background and moderate Loonie strength (or, at the very least, flat economic improvement), the pair may be poised for a significant move lower: Attached Image (click to enlarge) On shorter time frames, the pair appears to be arguably short-term range-bound, with a ceiling around 1.4740 and a floor 1.4440, with the vast majority of its time between mid-June and the present spent in the lower half of this "box" and in fact below the above-referenced .50 Fib: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For my part, I am going to short the pair from current levels or on bounces with a TP around the 1.4440.

Was a bit tired yesterday, so I focused on what remaining positions I had open (EUR/USD short, EUR/JPY short, and USD/JPY long) ... and then went to bed. The EUR/USD short closed out, as did the USD/JPY long, but the EUR/JPY short is still open with a little bit of grid in place below the position to catch any downward follow-through. So here's my multiple time frame analysis for today, with the ones showing consistency of price in relation to the 200 period SMA in bold (excluding the ones showing "nearby impulsive movement"): Pair Price in Relation to 1H/6H 200 Period SMA EUR/USD Below/Below (Consider Shorts) GBP/USD Below/Below but w/Nearby Impulsive Movement (Consider Shorts) AUD/USD Above/Below (Take No Trades) EUR/JPY Above/Below (Take No Trades) USD/JPY Above/Above (Consider Longs) GBP/JPY Slightly Above/Below but w/Nearby Impulsive Movement (Hesitantly Consider Shorts) NZD/USD Above/Below (Take No Trades) USD/CAD Below/Above (Take No Trades) USD/CHF Slightly Below/Above (Hesitantly Consider Longs) EUR/AUD Below/Below (Consider Shorts) CHF/JPY Above/Below (Take No Trades) GBP/AUD Below/Below but w/Nearby Impulsive Movement (Consider Shorts) GBP/NZD Below/Above (Take No Trades) AUD/NZD Above/Above (Consider Longs) (however, a long would involve a fairly significant negative swap) CAD/JPY Above/Below (Take No Trades) EUR/CAD Below/Below (Consider Shorts) EUR/NZD Below/Above (Take No Trades) So, in summary, here are the pairs in which I want to consider trades: EUR/USD short , USD/JPY long , USD/CHF long , EUR/AUD short , and EUR/CAD short -- not an incredibly exciting collection. Unfortunately, I am still waiting for GBP to settle after its recent drop and in light of upcoming Cable data and the BOE's rate decision, it's probably best to stand aside for the next few days with respect to GBP pairs. With the shorts, I'll be fashioning entries to sell at the .764, with the target price being the .236; with the buys, vice versa.

After I have done my multiple time frame analysis and winnowed out a few pairs, I can now spend my time focusing more closely on the remaining ones: EUR/USD short, USD/JPY long, USD/CHF long, EUR/AUD short, and EUR/CAD short. EUR/USD Short For the past several days, the pair has been moving choppily sideways. At least one article I have read about the pair has suggested not ruling out a bounce toward 1.3450, which is at the edge of a downward sloping trend line. http://www.efxnews.com/story/25693/e...vg-commerzbank That being said, even these analysts cannot overlook the obvious long-term bearish trend the pair is likely to enjoy against the backdrop of ECB easing and Fed tightening, with the former likely to come sooner than the Fed's interest rate hikes. For my part, I will be fashioning an entry to short the pair should price strike the .764 level. USD/JPY Long As noted in my post of yesterday, the pair is in a long-term range, the ceiling of which is the 103.00. Although I would prefer taking a buy lower in the range, given the fact that the .236 is at about 102.34 and there are 65+ pips between the .236 and 103.00, I think it may be worth taking a long here at the .236. USD/CHF Long Because I'm probably going to delve into a EUR/USD short, I'm not going to take advantage of the USD/CHF long, due to the close correlation between the two pairs. EUR/AUD Short I am not precisely sure what this pair is up to yet. For several weeks prior to 7/18, the pair was in a nice range between 1.4550 and 1.4400; I repeatedly shorted the pair from the "ceiling" of this range (due to positive swap). It may be that it is falling into a new "box"/range below the former range; it certainly doesn't appear to be decisively trending. That being said, the positive swap is such that this is one of those positions you can hold for lengthy periods of time without watching your modest target price being eaten into. Fashioning an order to short should price strike the .764 level. EUR/CAD Short Given my trouble getting out of a EUR/CAD short position last week, you'd think I'd stay away. But nooooo ... . This is because I believe that EUR is weakening and likely to weaken significantly going forward, but that the Loonie going to be experiencing level to modest economic improvement, albeit at a slower pace than its neighbor to the south. Short at the .764.

Shortly after Kiwi data last night, I decided to set up a directional grid for the pair going short all the way to 1.54400: Attached Image My analysis is pretty much consistent with this article: http://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/tec...ng/2014/08/11/ The article ultimately targets 1.5400 (which is ambitious).

Not a single one of my entry orders executed ... . I had hoped to get a bounce with EUR crosses -- never happened. And USD/JPY never dippped. With USD/JPY, I'm keeping an eye on that 103.00 level; it's provided some resistance in the past.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Today, I'm pretty much not going to add any new positions. I've got a EUR/USD short grid in place all the way down to 1.3200, a EUR/JPY short grid all the way down to 136.00, and that EUR/NZD short grid I mentioned above. Unfortunately, GBP/USD did another drop and roll ( sans bounce), leaving me peeved that I didn't set up a short grid for the pair. With Usable Maintenance Margin at 87.07%, I want to leave some room for an AUD position of some kind after I see what RBA Governor Stevens has in store in a few hours from now (probably going to revisit a EUR/AUD short). Don't know what he can possibly add on top of the RBA minutes which were a snore.

If these stats on NZD/USD tell us anything, it's that too many people who want to go long have been unsuccessful in calling a bottom: Attached Image While I was looking to consider a buy around the .8400 level, I think it's too early to tell whether that is going to stick. I think I am going to have to wait until (at the very least), price crosses the 200 period SMA on the 1H before committing to anything ... . As usual, I let all the people attempting to go long here do the heavy lifting for me ... . Although I'm hardly a fan of indicators, the slow stochastic on the 8H is showing some evidence that the pair may be preparing to turn higher, but the RSI displays weakness and indicates that the sellers may not yet be done. Additionally, the MACD points lower ... . All in all, not a time to wade in long unless it's on a measured risk basis (proportionally smaller lot than usual).

Well, EUR/USD ripped through a bunch of grid levels, but Euro weakness (if that's what it was, as opposed to Greenback strength), did not help a great deal in exiting my net positions in either EUR/JPY (short) or EUR/NZD (short); JPY weakness was responsible for the former; NZD weakness for the later. Current Open Positions EUR/USD short (grid trade all the way down to 1.31500). Current price is .08 pips above entry price; no additions taken. EUR/JPY short (grid trade all the way down to 1.36000) + pivot point additions. Current price is 56 pips above the net entry price; price currently outside the .764, so no additions taken. EUR/NZD short (grid trade all the way down to 1.54400) + pivot point additions. Current price is 57 pips above the net entry price; no additions taken. I am concerned here that the Kiwi has yet to bottom out. It is below .8400 and does not appear to be motivated to reverse in any meaningful way yet. Given the fact that current Usable Maintenance Margin is hovering around 83% (I've been experimenting with lots that are 1 x equity for each of my trade legs -- a bit rich for my blood), I'm not going to be entering any new positions. I've been waiting for a Cable bounce (that has not been forthcoming), for AUD to bottom (not yet), and for a good CAD opportunity (looks like I missed a bit of the boat with CAD/JPY, although it's probably because the 1H and 6H were not consistent, although the pair's just poked its head above the 6H 200 period SMA). You'll also notice that I'm violating one of my cardinal rules -- not to double up on currencies. In fact, I'm now tripled up on the Euro. Well, that happens every so often. The weakness of a particularly currency is so compelling that you just can't pass it up.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
EUR/USD managed to hit another level before retracing a few pips providing another possible selling opportunity going forward. However, it is also possible that the pair is losing some steam, and so the grid has been truncated to down to 1.3210. Unfortunately, EUR/JPY continues to move toward the 108 level, leaving me standing aside until the pair settles, especially since the pair has managed to claw its way over to the bullish side of the 6H 200 period SMA. 108 has provided some resistance in the past; we'll naturally see how that plays out. The grid there has also been truncated, given the fact that we are almost 100 pips away from the entry price. Exiting this position "with grace" (i.e., net positive) may take a little doing, especially given the weakness the Yen has experienced in the past several days; however, with a nearly breakeven swap and a tolerable drawdown attributable to the position, I can afford to be quite patient with the pair as it sorts itself out. EUR/NZD engaged in some constructive movement toward my target price with a bounce being experienced by the Kiwi. The entire grid has been eliminated in order to potentially devote resources to other Kiwi plays and to retire at least one of the Euro positions. Frankly, I will hate to see the position go given its heavy positive swap, but do what you gotta do. Current Open Positions EUR/USD short (grid trade down to 1.3210). Current price is 33 pips above entry price; no additions taken, as price is currently above the .764. EUR/JPY short (grid trade down to 1.3640) + pivot point additions. Current price is nearly 90 pips above the net entry price; no additions taken, as price is currently above the .764. EUR/NZD short (grid trade + pivot point additions). Current price is 16 pips above the net entry price; no additions taken. And now to grind through the charts to look at pairs that aren't represented in this mix: AUD, GBP, and CAD, with particular focus on GBP/AUD, GBP/CAD, and AUD/CAD (long only do to swap) ... .

--- 帖子 #210 ---
So taking a gander at GBP/AUD (which I'd want to short), AUD/CAD (long only), and GBP/CAD, I'm not particular excited about the prospects. GBP/AUD is currently hanging around the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point 0 line, which represents yesterday's low. That being said, there is a nice double top formation on the 1H around the .764, so it might be worth fashioning an entry order to short there: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am not particularly thrilled about that however, in light of nearby impulsive movement (no doubt primarily attributable to Cable's recent descent) and the fact that AUD has made a sizable bounce from .9250, its possible descent back toward that level may provide a better selling opportunity for GBP/AUD than exists right now. AUD/CAD is currently at or around the .764 and is arguably in a short-term range or, at the very least, capped by a particular ceiling around 1.019 that is cleaner than its floor: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In 20-20 hindsight I probably missed a long opportunity toward the bottom of this range; since we're near the top, I'm not fond of going long here until the Aussie figures out some kind of directionality or falls into a cleaner range. GBP/CAD presents an interesting set-up. What it looks like to me is that it has been range since May, but the range is large -- about 300 pips wide: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ordinarily, if the pair is in a range, you would buy at the bottom of the range and sell at the top. Fundamentally speaking, the U.K.'s economy has been improving somewhat, and there appears to be a hawkish minority of BOE chair members that are beginning to get antsy about increasing rates. The Canadian economy's improvement has been halting and data has been all over the map, it seems, painting Van Gogh "Sunflowers" one month and Edvard Munch's "The Scream" the next. The Loonie economy is either flat or improving in bits and spurts and in an inconsistent fashion. However, GBP/USD has been in a virtual tankathon since testing the 1.72 mark mid-July. Ultimately, this is the point at which I tear my hair out: (1) if GBP continues to weaken and CAD remains flat, the pair tanks; (2) if GBP flattens and CAD strengthens, the pair tanks; (3) if GBP strengthens and CAD remains flat, the pair rises; (4) if GBP flattens and CAD weakens, the pair rises; (5) if GBP strengthens and CAD weakens, the pair rises. Because GBP may not be done weakening, and my view on CAD is that its relative strength will remain flat or improve modestly going forward, I think the play to make here is either (1) do a breakout play below the current range using a grid; or (2) wait until the pair is near the top of the range (around 1.8475) to short it. As purely a short-term play, I am going to chose the former, setting up a short grid below current price starting at around 1.8100 and reaching down around 100 pips.

Current Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.31939 (grid trade w/grid down to 1.3100). The beginning of this week's session saw the pair hit two of the grid levels as the pair grinds lower. Price is currently in the green for the third grid level it hit, so no additions are taken. EUR/JPY short at 136.934 (grid trade + pivot point additions w/grid down to 136.40); TP 136.934. The pair is moving constructively in the direction of my TP. Price, however, is currently 57 pips over the entry price and appears to have come off its highs, at least in the short term. An entry order is fashioned to add to the position should price strike the .764. Should that order execute, the TP will be modified to +10 pips, and grid levels will be fit below it should there be room. GBP/CAD short at 1.81299 (grid trade w/grid down to 1.8070). The trade I hoped would be a breakout has basically gone sideways. Price is currently 21 pips above entry, and an entry order is fashioned to add to the position should price strike the .764. Should that order execute, the TP will be modified to +10 pips, and grid levels will be fit below it should there be room. EUR/NZD short at 1.57262 (grid trade w/grid down to 1.5400). After the short position I held for a good part of its last week hit its TP, I decided to reimplement the grid I originally had below. At the beginning of today's session, price ripped through one level during the massive session open 125 pip + wicking event, but then (due to the accompanying massive slippage) caught three sell orders of the grid virtually simultaneously without hitting any of their limits (reminder to self -- reset the default order execution parameters to FOK (fill or kill) or to within a reasonable number of pips of the order rather than to best market price, as they are currently). After price calmed down a bit, I fashioned a sell order to execute should price strike the .764, which it did. Unfortunately, with all the gyrations, current price is now 85 pips over the net position price, which is kind of a bummer. That being said, the pair enjoys good positive swap on the sell side ... . New Positions At the beginning of today's session, I had thoughts of attempting to push a GBP/AUD or EUR/AUD short into the mix if at all possible, since AUD is not currently represented. Between the two, EUR/AUD looks better as a general matter. GBP/AUD has experienced a bit of a bounce or is going sideways since Friday's session, but EUR/AUD appears to be taking on the trajectory of EUR/USD, grinding downward as the Euro inevitably loses traction against its various counterparts. The problem with that is that EUR is currently overrepresented in my mix. This could turn out to be a good thing, but a major retracement could also ripple across all three of my currently open EUR cross positions. This is one drawback (if it can be seen as that) with my effort to not double up on single currencies if all possible or, in the alternative, to create an even balance of currencies across the entire portfolio. With that in mind (not doubling up or creating an even balance), I should probably turn my attention to other, underrepresented currencies in this mix. These would be AUD (0), CAD (1), GBP (1), USD (1), NZD (1), and JPY (1) or AUD/CAD (long only), AUD/USD (long only), AUD/NZD (sell has a better swap than buy), AUD/JPY (long only), AUD/CAD (long only), USD/CAD, GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, GBP/NZD (short only), and NZD/CAD (long only), NZD/JPY (long only), NZD/USD (long only), and USD/JPY. I have highlighted the "consistent" pairs below, with the exception of the pairs that are consistent, but which have negative swap in the direction of the consistency (e.g., AUD/NZD is consistently above the 1H and 6H time frame 200 period MA's, but positive swap is on the sell side for that pair). Multiple Time Frame Analysis Price in Relation to 200 Period MA on 1H and 6H AUD/CAD Above/Above AUD/USD Below/Below AUD/NZD Above/Above AUD/JPY Above/Above USD/CAD Above/Above GBP/USD Below/Below USD/JPY Above/Above GBP/JPY Above/Below NZD/JPY Above/Below NZD/USD Below/Below GBP/NZD Above/Above NZD/CAD Below/Below The problem with some of these pairs (USD/JPY and GBP/USD, for example) is that they have already experienced substantially rippage and there is a danger that traders will shortly near exhaustion and that a big retracement (temporary or otherwise) is in the making for them. If that is the case, it is better to wait until that occurs to take advantage of it, rather than to dive in here mid-stream. For example, GBP/USD is showing thorough exhaustion of sellers on the daily, and USD/JPY should be exhausting buyers ... . I thoroughly regret deleting my USD/JPY long grid above 103 and not setting up a GBP/USD short grid south of 1.69 ... , but, hey, you can't catch everything ... . All in all, I think I'll stand aside for now with respect to adding new positions in new pairs, with an effort being made to exit the EUR/JPY position gracefully, thus freeing up a spot in my four pair open position set-up (it kinda seems like that is the way I'm going to be trading most of the time -- four open positions in four different pairs ... .) Notes With the addition of those positions in EUR/NZD, my usable maintenance margin (at 81.70%) moved quickly above where I have been targeting it to be. That being said, my general rule is to keep maximum exposure to &lt;10 x equity, and total positions are still under (barely) that level. I continue to confine the legs of my positions to 1 x equity, looking to cycle through a few weeks' of trades at that level to see what maximum intratrade drawdown looks like, how many pairs I can trade simultaneously (it's looking like four to five), and the like without feeling a sense of panic or discomfort with what the equity is experiencing and ensuring that I never approach a margin call which I haven't in the approximately two months I've been trading using Pivot Points and directional grids.

Deleting remainder of GBP/CAD short grid to make room in the mix for a more productive pair ... . It's not doing much since my entry on Friday -- sideways at best.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Also, I am going to transition over from the EUR/NZD short to a GBP/NZD short grid once the EUR/NZD short grid position closes out. GBP/NZD short probably has one of the better positive swaps out there and this will eliminate some of the Euro doubling up I've got out there right now.

I'm going to sideline myself for a few days from opening new positions until I can clear at least one of the positions I've got open now: EUR/JPY short at 136.934 (grid trade + pivot point additions): price currently 33 pips above entry price; entry order is fashioned to add to the position should price strike the .764. GBP/CAD short at 1.81559 (grid trade + pivot point additions): price currently 52 pips above entry price; no additions taken, as price is above .764. GBP/NZD short at 1.98051 (grid trade + pivot point additions): price currently 70 pips above entry price (I just had to open this one ... . Couldn't help myself ... .); no pivot point additions taken, as price is above .764. EUR/NZD short at 1.57262 (grid trade + pivot point additions): price currently 94 pips above entry price; no pivot point additions taken, as price is above .764. Out of all these positions, I'm betting on EUR/JPY going first. I don't have a huge problem hanging on to it (mildly positive swap), it's just that it's taking up a position that could be used for another pair (although it might ultimately pay off to set up the grid below the TP again since it appears that the BOJ is not going to be undertake the stimulus package that was advertised last week and may have contributed to Yen weakness. The same would go for the GBP/CAD short, which I intended to be a breakout play (that never materialized); just rather use that slot for something a little more productive. EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD have always been frisky, so I am not yet concerned that price is currently an undesirable distance from the entry. Moreover, I am a huge fan of positive swap for these; if I could only have two pairs on the desert island, it would be these two ... . One of the things that you have to do from time to time with this method is look at your usable margin/usable maintenance margin and decide whether you should continue opening positions or whether you are at risk of overtrading at some point in light of what you already have open. I don't believe I'm at that point yet, but don't intend to get there ... . I'll post when I free up a slot ... .

So much for my prognostication skills (which betted on the EUR/JPY short closing first) ... . The GBP/CAD short hit its TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This leaves me with my EUR/JPY short at 136.934/TP 136.834, my GBP/NZD short at 1.98202/TP 1.98102, and my EUR/NZD short at 1.57359/TP 1.57249. The EUR/JPY has approached the 137.00 level several times, but appears hesitant to pierce that level and hit my TP. It could be that, going forward, it falls into a range here between 138 and 137 ... .

At this point in the day, I pretty much know what I'm going to do with my Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points at the end of the day. This is because my current total exposure is greater than I would like it (usable margin is currently at 80.15%/exposure is at 11.7 x equity, which is a little over of where I want to be), so I want to focus on closing out what I've got to get the max exposure under 10 x equity (60k lots total for all positions). With the EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD short positions, I am comfortable with waiting to add to those for substantial periods of time. The positive swap is so good that I can probably just hold those without addition to see if they hit their TP's unassisted or present better selling opportunities to add to those positions if the Kiwi does not settle on a bottom somewhere near its current level. The EUR/JPY position seems poised to move lower below the psychological 1.37 level, but appears hesitant to do so. While it enjoys a modestly positive swap, it is not enough to make me regret when the position hits its TP. Out of all three positions, I would prefer to close out the EUR/JPY position first, and that is what I'll concentrate on in the short term, leaving the NZD longs to sort themselves out unassisted. Currently, I have an open entry order to sell EUR/JPY should price strike the today's .764 at 137.527. Should that expire unfilled by the end of the New York close, I'll fashion a new entry order to add to the position should price strike the new .764 formed after the New York close.

Hi ZebraSquirl, I like the thinking "no panic! urgent to do nothing and be patient", even more when you explain that the swap is nicely on your side, especially with the 2 Nzd positions. Just one thing I do not catch so far: How come you are 11.7x equity with just 3 positions (3 pairs)? I guess it is because you have already taken actions and averaged the entry price 2 or 3 times depending of the position. Am I right, or I am missing something? I do appologise if it is explained already in on of your posts and I have somehow missed it :oSS Thanks again for your thread, it actually helps me a lot and makes myself think. Cheers, J-F

Exactly right ... . With EUR/JPY, for example, I've taken five positions or so over the last week for a total of 30k in the net position. With EUR/NZD, I've taken four 6k positions and one 2k position for a total of 24k and with GBP/NZD, I've taken a total of two 6K positions and one 2k position for a total of 14k. (I decided to take the 2 2k positions at the top of each of these pairs' trajectories just as a measured risk type of position to take advantage of the price extreme ... .). This is for a total of 70k. My current equity is about 6K, so 70K/6k = 11.7 x equity. The EUR/JPY short position is the cleanest example of my trading strategy (all legs of the net position are the same size -- 6K or 1 x equity). As I've made various tweaks to my way of doing things, I've been playing with lot size to see (1) how many pairs I can have open at one time; and (2) the maximum exposure I experience as that trade cycles through to net profit for the position given a particular lot size for the legs of that position. It's kind of looking like the largest lot size I want to go per leg is 1 x equity with four pairs open max. But during this 1 x equity per leg trade cycle, I kind of wanted to push the limits of my max exposure rule and test my comfortability with intratrade drawdown to see whether I could go higher than 10 x equity exposure and still not have a heart attack. I think my approach going forward will be to stick with 1 x equity per leg, but to discontinue opening trades in new pairs until I have closed out problematic net positions, which I call "dogs." For example, I initially tagged the EUR/JPY short as a "dog" when the pair moved somewhat substantially against my position (nearly to 138 from 137). Late last week, I had actually closed out all the other pairs' trades in net profit, leaving the EUR/JPY as sole remaining open position(s). At that point, recognizing that it was a "dog," I should have stopped trading in other pairs altogether until I was able to close out that position in net profit. When I've only got room to trade in four pairs, having one "dog" in the bunch is plenty to have on one's hands ... . In practice, however, this is tough to do. I naturally want to keep trading since I want to try to keep making money somewhere. Yet, by continuing to do that, I open up the possibility that I'll acquire another "dog" in the mix, thus increasing my exposure. "Dogs" generally require greater patience and the addition of more positions in order to get the net position into profitability or the possibility of profitability ... . If I would just stick to this rule, I could probably go larger with each of the leg sizes, but I'll stick with 1 x equity for now ... .

Current Open Positions EUR/JPY short at 136.934/TP 136.834: Price is currently 18 pips above target price. An entry order is fashioned to short the pair should price strike the .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point level (137.309). Should that order fill, the TP for the net position will be adjusted to +10 pips for the net position. GBP/NZD short at 1.98202/TP 1.98102: Price is currently 24 pips above target price. An entry order is fashioned to short the pair should price strike the .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point level (1.99108). Should that order fill, the TP for the net position will be adjusted to +10 pips for the net position. EUR/NZD short at 1.57359/TP 1.57259: Price is currently 64 pips above target price. An entry order is fashioned to short the pair should price strike the .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point level (1.58465). Should that order fill, the TP for the net position will be adjusted to +10 pips for the net position. Notes Earlier today, I figured I would focus solely on closing out the EUR/JPY position in net profit. Unfortunately, that pair is appearing to be uniquely stubborn in moving past the 137 handle, at least in the short term. Consequently, I need to focus on exiting all three pairs in net profit in the event that my efforts to close the EUR/JPY position in net profit prove unavailing. As previously noted, I am fine with carrying EUR/NZD and GBP/NZD shorts for quite an extraordinary length of time due to their positive swaps, but also have concerns with my maximum exposure, which is above where I'd like it to be (still at 11.7 x equity). Closing out any one of these three positions would be put max exposure below 10 x ... . It is also kind of nice to take a break from looking at opening new positions in other pairs for a bit, especially since we are coming up to the end of the month/the beginning of the next. This can produce some more than usual volatility as traders look to close out trades, lock in profit, etc.

Okay -- I really did not see this coming ... . Both EUR/JPY and GBP/NZD shorts hit their respective TP's: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This leaves one open position -- the EUR/NZD short at 1.57359/TP 1.57259. Price is currently 13 pips away from the net position entry. Entry orders to add to the EUR/JPY and GBP/NZD short positions are, of course, deleted. Since price is so close to the TP with respect the EUR/NZD position, I'm deleting that, too. The remaining open position is 4.16 x equity and usable maintenance margin in now at 93.35% -- back in my comfort zone ... .

Multiple Time Frame Analysis Pair/Relationship to 1H &amp; 6H Period SMA (Consistent Pairs Highlighted) EUR/USD Below/Below (But How Much Lower Will It Move?) GBP/USD Below/Below (But May Be Short-Term Range-Bound) AUD/USD Above/Below EUR/JPY Below/Below USD/JPY Above/Above (But How Much Higher Can It Go?)

EUR/NZD (Below/Above) (But May Be Short-Term Range-Bound; Reinstate the Grid Below Down to 1.5500?) Well, there's a number of pairs that have good consistency between the 1H and 6H time frames. Ordinarily, I would figure that all of these would be good candidates for pivot point plays. There are also a few pairs that may be inconsistent between the two time frames, but are on the verge of presenting interesting set-up's for range plays or longer-term enter and hold plays where positive swap is on your side. On a more macro level, EUR crosses generally appear to be reaching historic S/R of some kind reaching back into late last year. The question is, "How much lower can the Euro go?" Well, quite a bit. The thing is that you have to reach quite far back into history to figure out how low that might be, and I would say it is all the back to the 7/2012 low of around 1.2100 or, at the very least, to the financial meltdown when EUR/USD came off its high of slightly north of 1.61 in July of 2008 all the way down to 1.24 in October of that year (three months; 3,600 + pips; wow). That being said, traders may hesitate to push it lower amidst the muddled timetable for U.S. interest rate hikes and the ECB's glacial pace of easing (which should have been done a long time ago in the scheme of things). Wait to sell on bounces, I say, ... . GBP/USD, however, has got a lot of air under it of more recent vintage. It appears to have temporarily taken a respite from its steep dive, but it could naturally dive even lower, and it has plenty of room to do so before meeting stiff resistance, with the next stop on the elevator ride down being the .618 of the line formed between the 7/13 low to the 7/14 high -- around 1.6284 or so. That being said, Cable is not sitting in the same seat as the Euro. The BOE is itchy to normalize; the ECB is on the verge of ... kinda ... sorta ... well, easing (if they ever figure out how to do that). More positive labor data for the U.K., for example, could stop the slide dead in its tracks. My love affair with EUR/JPY, I think, has somewhat come to an end ... at least for now. The pair is on the verge of this year's low, which has provided some mild resistance. The Yen weakened a bit on a short term basis merely on rumors that the BOJ was considering an additional stimulus package (an idea quickly squashed) causing the pair to bump upward, but it remains to be seen whether it will have the gall to break 136 convincingly or continue to muddle somewhat directionless in the short-term between that level and something north of 137.00. USD/JPY. Well, what can I say. Too high to wade in now, which is all I would want to do with the pair, and the dips aren't really that deep presently. Moreover, if we do get a short spell of bad U.S. data, we could get a better buying opportunity lower. With EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD, or EUR/NZD , I think there is still room to short these and hold them for a bit, which I would like to do due to positive swap. I am going to go make some dinner and be back with my final selections ... .

You might have noticed that I added the "ZigZag" indicator to my charts (the idea was borrowed from Hayseed, who employs the ZigZag in various ways to fashion his entries and exits), and I'm going to start experimenting with these with certain pairs to see how they work out. In particular, I am going to focus on using the ZigZag with pairs that offer good positive swap, as I anticipate holding these positions for longer term plays, such as on shorts for GBP/NZD, EUR/NZD, EUR/AUD, and GBP/AUD, all of which have stellar swap. I will probably do my same, multi-time frame analysis to figure out which direction I want to take a trade for a given pair or, in the case of the above-referenced pairs that a short is a good play. The principle of entering at "price extremes" applies with equal force to the ZigZag as to the use of pivot points. You are looking at previous price action (as shown by the ZigZag) to fashion entry orders where price has previously turned. For example, say I was going to use the ZigZag for an NZD/USD long set-up, where I would want to buy on dips: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I can see how the ZigZag might offer some advantages over pivot points, at least over the ones I am currently using, which use Fibonacci calculations based upon the previous day's high and low. Don't get me wrong; the previous day's high and low are important, as are the week's high/low, the month's high/low, etc., it's just that the levels within that high/low may not necessarily hold particular significance (with the probable exception of the pivot point). In all likelihood, traders are looking at obvious support and resistance, some of which may or may not coincide with the particular day's pivot levels. Naturally, everyone would like to know where price has previously actually turned, and the ZigZag will show that.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
So, here's an actual set-up I have for a EUR/NZD short play. The entry (shown by the red arrow) is an f-up (always check to make sure you are not entering a market order before you click "OK"). Each of the horizontal levels you see drawn on the chart represents a level where I have fashioned an entry order to go short should price strike that level, as price has shown a tendency to turn at these points in previous history: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this particular case, I want to attempt to accumulate EUR/NZD at price extremes and then hold it to take advantage of its positive swap, so I will be taking a few small positions in the pair over time (although you can naturally also use ZigZag's to just do a single entry) and then will bail out of the net position when it's to my advantage. In the case of EUR/NZD, my target is quite ambitious (although you could limit the TP to the 1.57319, an area at which price has previously turned): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although price bottomed out at 1.54156, my TP is going to be set north of that at 1.5500 for the net position I accumulate (assuming I don't grow impatient and bail out of it earlier).

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Fashioning entries based on the ZigZag are proving to have additional advantages over the Pivot Points. If you are using Daily Pivot Points (whether it be Camarilla, Fib Retracement, or the like), you will have to wait for the New York close to fashion your entries, since that is when the new pivot points form. Fashioning entries based on the turning points or pivots established by the ZigZag can be done without regard to the New York close ... . Made a little bit on the EUR/USD short pivot point trade, the EUR/CAD grid (which I ultimately deleted out to play with the ZigZag for a bit), and an AUD/NZD short, which was an afterthought after my posting yesterday regarding pivot point trades I was looking at. Current Open Positions GBP/USD short at 1.65911/TP 1.65690 (pivot point) CAD/JPY long at 95.559/TP 95.903 (ZigZag short term) GBP/NZD short at 1.97849/TP 1.94000 (ZigZag long term/carry) AUD/NZD short at 1.11531/TP 1.11355 (ZigZag short term) EUR/NZD short at 1.57369/TP 1.55000 (ZigZag long term/carry) Usable Maintenance Margin 91.96% Notes Obviously being tripled up in NZD long is not ideal. I kind of got carried away with the ZigZag I guess. Fortunately, when I experiment with something new, I generally do it with smaller lots than usual, which leaves me room to play around without getting burned or getting backed into a position that is difficult to get out of. After I scarf down some dinner, I'll be back to look at pairs to see if there's anything else I want to get into. I am not enthusiastic about getting into too much; this will be a long weekend due to the Labor Day holiday on Monday ... .

--- 帖子 #234 ---
One thing I have to figure out with the ZigZag (if I'm going to use it in the long term) is what lot sizes to use on what trades. With the long-term carry trades (like EUR/NZD short), I may want to make the lot sizes smaller; the short term trades, larger. Naturally, I'd prefer just using one lot size and sticking with it regardless of whether it's a short-term or long-term trade, it's just that I anticipate adding to the longer-term carry trades more throughout the history of the trade.

I modified the GBP/NZD and AUD/NZD shorts to take profit at 10 pips for the net position out of concern that I was overly exposed to NZD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see where I entered positions around short positions around the tops of Zig's ... (although I think I goofed up both initial entries as market orders; sleep deprivation is bad for your trading). Holding on to the EUR/NZD as the Kiwi long-term play.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
The GBP/USD and CAD/JPY shorts hit their target prices, leaving me with only the long-term EUR/NZD carry position in place over the weekend. Usable maintenance margin is currently at a more than comfortable 97.25%. Week's Results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Month's Results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I started out the month with a balance of $7099.29, withdrawing $1412.44 mid-month to bring the account down to $6000 even. Even assuming that I had kept the entire 7k plus in the account, I earned a total of $649.46, resulting in an ROI of $649.46/$7099.29 or .0915 (9.15%) with per leg lot sizes that I ran at .5 times equity through the middle of the month, 1 times equity mid-month through the 25th or so, and then with .5 times equity for the few ZigZag trades I finished up this week with. Although I think a 9.15 % ROI is more than satisfactory for my purposes, that number could be improved modestly upwards if I consistently use lot sizes that are larger than .5 times equity and up to 1 x equity, as I long as I don't go overboard with my maximum exposure, which I think can be achieved through limiting the number of pairs in which I have open trades and keeping the amount of usable maintenance margin at or above 80%. I don't think I've really thoroughly tested my tolerance for an exposure that involves legs of 1x equity (I only did that for a couple weeks, really), and I may continue to attempt to do that as I test entries and exits using ZigZags throughout the month of September. I want to continue testing out different things until the end of the year before settling on a strategy I like and can be successful at (and by successful, I mean, 5-10% ROI per month), at which time I will devote more substantial capital to this type of trading. I naturally don't want to do that if I am unsuccessful (like I was January through the end of June doing things the "old school" way) or inconsistently successful, and, frankly, eight weeks of success is not enough to go "all in" ... yet. I would also note that this marks the eighth consecutive profitable week in a row, and the eighth week in a row during which I have been able to close out all positions (initial legs plus entries) in net positive territory for the entire position. For some reason, this month (in terms of pure pippage gained) was far better than last. In July, I made 81 total trades for 1007.5 pips; this month 204 trades for 2525.5 pips. Without digging into all the trades, my sense is that this month saw a little bit more dramatic movement in certain pairs than last and the directional grid trades I had set up as an experiment took major advantage of that. That being said, those are not particularly consistent results; they are both positive results, but this month's pippage is two times larger than July's, leading me to believe that it will not always be possible to get a 9% + ROI each and every month. I guess time will tell ... . The average pippage for July and August is 1766.5 pips per month ... .

I have one position left over from last week -- a EUR/NZD short that I am thinking will be a long-term hold type of proposition, with the intent being to take advantage of positive swap the pair has to offer, so setting up entry orders to add to that position is the first order of business today. As I mentioned at the end of last week, I am going to continue playing with fashioning entries based upon the ZigZag indicator. Looking at the 15 minute chart, I see a couple of levels that are of interest (indicated by the horizontal lines): Attached Image (click to enlarge) You'll notice that there are two horizontal lines, each of which represent levels at which price has turned previously. The question is, should I place entry orders at both levels, just one, or should I look to enter at an even higher level? I am going to pass on at least an entry at the lower level (at about 1.57488), and this is why. If you look at price action with respect to this level, price has turned at this level only once, at least on the 15 minute chart. With respect to the higher level, though, price has either tested this level on multiple occasions or, at least, has shown a tendency to retrace from it, especially if you go out to higher time frames, so I will fashion an entry order to sell the pair if price strikes that particular level before the end of tomorrow's New York close (good for day entry). The entry will be slightly below the peak of that particular Zig. You can naturally set up other entries at higher peaks if you'd like, but I'm going to limit entries to one per day if I am adding to a position. Additionally, you should be looking at the valleys for potential entries, since previous support could arguably become resistance. With positions that you are considering for longer-term holds (like I am for this one), you may want to consider taking off pieces from time to time as long as it's profitable to do so in order to ensure that the net position doesn't become unduly large. In this particular case, the first leg of the position (I'm subject to FIFO, so this will be the first one that I will have to close) is in profit (it's not much -- 8.2 pips), but I'm going to close that leg at this time. The other question you will want to answer is whether you want to change your TP. Currently, the TP for the net EUR/NZD short position is 1.56300. However, in looking at the charts, I see some hesitancy to move past 1.57 and the fact that it hasn't been at 1.563 since mid-July. My short-term trading mindset is to generally smash and grab what I can. Here, however, I'm going to wait to see what the pair does; it's nearly at 1.5700 and is poised to break lower, should the Slow Stochastic be an indication of what's in store. And now I'll move on to see if there's anything else of interest out there ... .

I am not unduly excited about adding a bunch of positions today due to tomorrow's Labor Day holiday here in the U.S., which is likely to make for fairly slow trading during the New York session, and then potential volatility when New York opens after the holiday. Nevertheless, it can't hurt to do some multiple time frame analysis to see if there is stuff out there that is simply too good to pass up or that will do an adequate of job of gaining a few pips here and there. This time, I've put the consistent pairs in bold, and pairs that are inconsistent, but nevertheless might be of some interest, as underlined. As previously mentioned, look for longs if the pair is above the 200 period SMA on both time frames; for shorts, if the pair is below on both time frames. Multiple Time Frame Analysis on 1H and 6H Time Frames Pair/Price in Relation to 1H and 6H 200 Period SMA EUR/USD Below/Below GBP/USD Above, But At or Near/Below (Basically Sideways Since 8/21) AUD/USD Above/Below, But At or Near (With Arguable Resistance at 6H 200 Period SMA) EUR/JPY Below/Below (With Arguable Resistance at 6H 200 Period SMA) GBP/JPY Above/Below, But At or Near (With Arguable Resistance at 6H 200 Period SMA) NZD/USD Below/Below (But Unattractive as a Short Due to Negative Swap) EUR/AUD Below/Below GBP/AUD Below/Below NZD/JPY Above, But at Or Near/Below GBP/NZD Above/Above (But Unattractive as a Long Due to Negative Swap) AUD/NZD Above/Above (Of Interest as a Short Due to the Fact That It May be Topping) CAD/JPY Above/Above EUR/CAD Below/Below EUR/TRY Below/Below (Of Interest as a Short Due to Positive Swap, With Big Spread Being the Drawback During Certain Sessions) USD/RUB Above/Above (Of Interest for a Short Due to Positive Swap, With Big Spread Being the Drawback During Certain Sessions) I'll fashion whatever entries I'm going to do and post them here shortly ... .

Well, it appears that there are bunch of pairs that could be interesting. Currently, I only have a EUR/NZD short open, so my tendency is to look for other pairs that don't involve either of those currencies to round out my open positions. So this would involve looking at GBP, USD, JPY, AUD, and CAD. A few of the charts involving these pairs show substantial directional movement without retrace, which is not attractive to me as a set-up. I'd prefer to have a lot of Zigging and Zagging going on (more rangey type motion) than substantial trending. So here's what I'm going to go with: GBP/JPY long good for day entry at 172.195/TP 172.619. AUD/USD long good for day entry at .93053/TP .93275 USD/CAD long good for day entry at 1.08411/TP 1.09722 It's not particularly exciting, but it'll prevent me from having trading withdrawal today and Monday.

As an alternative, you can do a "shotgun start" (i.e., do entry orders for everything that appears attractive) to the week, see what fills, and then go with that. As an example of a "shotgun start" to the week, here would be my good for day "shotgun start" entries: Attached Image Ordinarily, what I've done with shotgun starts is check in on the platform from time to time to ensure that too many positions don't open. I generally don't want to have more than five (5) open positions at any one time. It keeps it simple, and my exposure limited. However, the drawback is that it is possible that you'll get doubled up on currencies ... .

I'm going to move up the TP of the EUR/NZD short position I've got open to 1.5705. Price is almost there, and I want to grab the profit here (for a nice start to the week, if possible). I will naturally regret doing this if price follows through lower, but, hey, can't catch everything ... .

I don't trade "exotics" much, primarily due to their large spread and strange charges per pip. That being said, I've been waiting to go long on the Ruble (short USD/RUB) for quite some time due to its positive swap and the Bank of Russia's interventionist policy in the currency when the value of the Ruble gets out of hand. I think it's time to consider that short now. I went all the way back to 6/2010 (which is all the data my broker has, perhaps because it was simply not traded before), and it is at an all time high. Unfortunately, the price movement turns upon events in the Ukraine more than anything else, and it is now impossible to tell what Putin will do next (that is, unless he is trading Forex, in which case I would short here if I were him, withdraw his troops and equipment, cash his position in, and then lather, rinse, repeat). However, the economic backdrop is one of increasing sanctions on the Russian Federation by both the EU and the U.S. which will probably have the effect of devaluing the currency (thus driving USD/RUB up further). Moreover, a decrease in the value of the Ruble will have negative economic effects on the R.F., as its consumers will have less and less buying power for foreign goods and the slump in exports due to sanctions will add additional fuel to worsening economic conditions. Ordinarily, a slump in the value of a currency would bolster exports as they become cheaper to foreign buyers, but not so here. Naturally, Russia's Central Bank could sell dollars and buy up Rubles to bolster the currency as they have done in the past. http://rbth.com/business/2014/03/21/...oat_35269.html For that reason, I am going to take a measured risk position (comparatively small lot as compared to other entries) and short the currency should price strike 37.15 with a TP of 36.239. Keep in mind that the pair has an oddball price per pip ( FXCM quotes .27 per pip; the vast majority of other pairs is .08-.10 per pip).

Ugh. I starting looking over my "shotgun start" orders for the week ... . I don't know if I was half in the bag or what ... . With ZigZag's, you'll notice that there is some variance between the ZigZag's depending upon the chart you're using (30 min., 1H, etc.).

I am going to fashion an entry order to add to the GBP/USD short should price strike the level of the next highest Zig (peak): Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm not going to change my target price just yet, as it's currently at the nearest Zag (valley) below. With the USD/RUB short on the 1H time frame, no higher Zig has yet formed. However, if I drill down to the 30 min., a higher Zig has developed just short of 37.50, with the current bid being about 20 pips short of that level, so I am going to fashion an entry order to short the pair should price strike that level. While I could change the TP here to the next lowest Zag on the 30 min., my target is a bit more ambitious -- the obvious congestion area between 36 and 36.50: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As I may have mentioned in previous posts, the USD/RUB short is a bit of a gamble.

Here's one of my ZigZag set-up's for a EUR/JPY short ... . On the chart, you'll see several levels. These represent places where price has turned previously, and it is at these levels that I'll be fashioning entry orders should price for the pair strike those levels: Attached Image (click to enlarge) These will be GTC (good until cancelled) entries. As far as the target price is concerned, I will set it at the Zag (valley) that is nearest current price (about 136.8).

So, here's all of my ZigZag entry orders: Attached Image Attached Image Attached Image Now it does seem like there are a lot of orders there and lot of exposure could open were I to just let them all go. However, I will naturally check in from time to time, see what executes, and then delete other pending orders if it appears that my exposure is becoming or could become uncomfortable or unmanageable. Generally speaking, I have found that I don't like it when I have positions open in more than five pairs. I would note that the EUR/TRY short imposes a heavy margin burden as compared to other pairs (something I don't usually have to pay attention to). For example, if you open 10 microlots of EUR/USD, you will use $320 of margin, but 10 microlots of EUR/TRY will use $800 of margin.

I will say one thing, describing the entries and exits using Pivot Points is a lot easier than describing where to enter/exit with ZigZag's. With the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points, it was always "sell at the .764 with the target price set at the .236" or "buy at the .236 with the target price set at the .764." For ZigZag's, I guess my description will generally be "Sell slightly below the nearest Zig (peak) with the target price being slightly above the nearest Zag (valley) below .. " or, conversely "Buy slightly above the nearest Zag (valley) with the target price being slightly below the nearest Zig (peak)." You will notice one thing with the ZigZag entry orders, and that it is that it looks slightly like a grid. However, the levels of the orders are not equal distances apart like in a grid; they are at levels that the ZigZag indicates price turned. Just thought I'd point that out ... . Setting up these levels of entry orders was something I couldn't really do with Pivot Points, since they're different every day (at least the ones I was using), so I guess in that sense the ZigZag has an advantage over Pivot Points. You can also set them up at the beginning of the week, and kind of leave them where they're at, too, which is nice; I don't have to enter new orders on a daily basis, unless it is to take advantage of a new Zig or Zag that has formed.

So, a few of my positions have opened at this point, and I basically want to look at what I've got open, what is pending, and delete any pending orders that I am not particularly attached to. This is what I have right now: GBP/USD short at 1.66090/TP 1.65900: I moved this TP up and deleted out the addition order. GBP/NZD short at 1.98536/TP 1.98000 EUR/NZD short at 1.56957/TP 1.56610 EUR/JPY short at 137.134/TP 136.810 USD/RUB short at 37.166/TP 36.498 Note: While I was writing this, the GBP/USD short hit its TP. I also deleted out the EUR/TRY short orders because they take up quite a bit of margin, and I'm at 95.23% Usable Margin at this point. Not that that level's outrageous, it's just that EUR/TRY is problematic due to spread, and I've already got a large spread position (the USD/RUB short) on the books at this point. Once I've got the USD/RUB short off the books, I'll take another look at EUR/TRY to trade on an experimental basis (since I generally do not do exotics).

EUR/JPY's price struck two of the Zig levels, resulting in a net position of 137.251 (it's on a bit of a tear). My target price is currently 136.873. I can either just leave it alone or bring it up to a higher Zig level. The nearest level below current price and that would result in profit for the net position is at 137.071 or so. While the profit to be made between the net position price and the new target isn't much (18 pips), I'm a smash and grab kind of guy, so I'm going to move the TP up to 137.071 for the net position. Current Usable Margin: 93.98%

--- 帖子 #257 ---
My shotgun start to the week resulted in quite a few things opening in the Asian. I modified several TP's on the fly to the nearest Zig or Zag, depending, so it may not match my shotgun start TP's exactly: Open Positions AUD/USD Long at .93054/TP .93457 EUR/JPY Short at 137.251/TP 137.071 GBP/NZD Short at 1.98536/TP 1.98000 GBP/AUD Short at 1.78206/TP 1.77732 EUR/NZD Short at 1.56957/1.566610 USD/RUB Short at 37.166/TP 37.066 Current Usable Margin: 91.52% Now that I have a fairly full boat, I'm going to look at what's not represented in the mix and delete out pending orders in light of that. Basically, only CAD is not represented now, so I'm going to delete all the penders for everything other than the penders to add to the above-referenced positions, except for the CAD crosses. I've got penders for CAD/JPY long, EUR/CAD short, and GBP/CAD short. Yen crosses are on a bit of a bullish bender, so I'm going to remove CAD/JPY long from consideration. Since the EUR/CAD short and GBP/CAD short are kind of on a similar footing, I think I leave both of those sets of penders out there for now, see what executes first, and the delete the other set.

The good news is: it was a 91.7 pip day: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The bad news: I've got more positions open and greater exposure than I'd like, thanks to my shotgun start: AUD/USD long at .92913 EUR/JPY short at 137.505 GBP/JPY short grid down to 172.20 EUR/AUD short at 1.41504 EUR/CAD short at 1.43161 EUR/NZD short at 1.57259 USD/RUB short at 37.308 ... with Usable Margin Currently at 76.67%. Point in fact, that margin use is not totally out of hand, but I also have to anticipate adding to positions, so I need to leave plenty of room for that to occur. In any event, using the ZigZag requires some adjustment. My original thinking was just to set up a good until cancelled grid at the Zigs/Zags and then just let it run. I'm not sure that's the way to go unless you're using .5 x equity or .25 equity leg sizes, and I'm currently running a cycle of trades at 1 x equity per leg to see how many pairs I can run at the same time at that exposure level. Previously, with the Pivot Points, I would just set up one entry per day at the end of the New York close, and that may be what I end up doing here. That way I would avoid what happened with EUR/JPY (I set up the grid to short from four different peaks, and price ripped through all of them, and is currently at the highest Zig peak at which I had an entry order). In any event, what I'm going to do is fashion entry orders to add to all of the above positions with the exception of the GBP/JPY (a grid trade) and the USD/RUB short (an experimental exotic with good positive swap). For shorts, the entry order will sell at the next highest Zig (peak); for longs, at the next lowest Zag (valley). As far as target prices are concerned: for shorts, move the TP to the Zag (valley) nearest current price or +10 pips, whichever is greater; for longs, move the TP to the Zig (peak) nearest current price of +10 pips.

Oh, and the other thing I wanted to mention (something I touched on briefly before), is the fact that different time frames give you slightly different ZigZag's. I previously indicated that I was going to look at the 1H only, but I'm also going to play with other time frames to see what works best.

As an example of what I'm talking about, here's how I'm going to fashion an entry order to add to my AUD/USD long: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've already taken a position from the level of the Zag (valley) that is nearest current price, so I'll fashion an entry order to buy should price reach the Zag below that one ... . With respect to Target Price, it is not exactly a clean decision on this chart due to choppiness ... . You can either shoot for the next highest Zag (valley) (on the basis that support becomes resistance) or the next highest Zig (peak), but it isn't particularly clear ... .

With respect to the GBP/JPY short directional grid, my net position is currently 173.047. This is because the bid hit the sell grid level at 173.10 and then the bid hit the sell grid level at 173.00 before the ask price reached 173.00 and before rebounding, thus doubling up the position. So, now that the average sell price is at 173.047, I'm going to adjust the TP for that net position to 173.00, and then squeeze in another level in the grid to sell if the bid = 173.00 with the expectation that price will continue lower (although there is some doubt that this will occur in light of RSI). Regretfully, I was goofing around with other stuff when GBP/JPY's price was hitting just shy of 174.00 and the RSI was indicating exhaustion in sellers (which is ordinarily the best time to set up a directional grid): Attached Image (click to enlarge) (GBP/JPY 4H w/14 Period RSI).

Awww, my USD/RUB short position hit its modest price target: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I was hoping to hang on to that position a bit longer to generate some positive swap and probably set the target price too close to do that ... . Oh, well ... . My EUR/CAD short also hit its TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That leaves me with two open positions: EUR/JPY short at 137.896 EUR/NZD short at 1.57497 My current exposure is 8 x equity with a usable margin 87.11%, so that doesn't leave me with a great deal of room to play with if I want to be a stickler about the 10 x equity max exposure rule. But I think there's enough room to add to these positions should price strike the next highest Zig (peak) to current price. The next highest one for EUR/JPY is about 138.24, so I'll fashion an entry order to sell the pair if it strikes that level. And the next highest one for EUR/NZD is about 1.5828, so I'll also fashion an entry order to sell the pair if it strikes that level. Next, I will look at pairs not currently represented in my mix, which are GBP, USD, CAD, and AUD (i.e., GBP/USD, GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD (short only due to swap), USD/CAD, AUD/USD (long only due to swap), and AUD/CAD (long only due to swap).

GBP/USD : The time to have taken notice of the pair's dramatic downward movement has passed somewhat (and I'm sad I missed it; would have been perfect for a directional grid; that being said, I did catch a piece of GBP weakness with my GBP/JPY short grid ... .) I'm going to wait for the pair to experience some kind of bounce before looking at it again. GBP/CAD : Like GBP/USD, I missed an opportunity to short from the consolidation area that immediately preceded the pair's post-holiday plunge. Like GBP/USD, I'm going to wait for a bounce of some kind ... . GBP/AUD : Hoping to see a good set up here ... . Good positive swap on the short side ... . Nope ... . Same trajectory as other Cable pairs ... . USD/CAD : I trade this pair infrequently for some reason, preferring to trade the Loonie when it is coupled with the Euro, Cable, or the Aussie. Multiple time frame analysis paints an equivocal picture, with price being below the 200 SMA on the 1H, but above it on the 6H, so I'm going to pass on the pair for now. AUD/USD : Wow ... . The upward trajectory over the past few days has been somewhat dramatic. Were it to be another pair, I would be tempted to short it, but shorting AUD involves negative swap. I might consider wading in were price to dip back toward .9300 and, more attractively, in the vicinity of .9275. AUD/CAD : On the 1H, this pair is a fierce hot mess and way more choppy than AUD/USD which, point in fact, suits me just fine, except for the fact that an entry would be quite sloppy; there is wicking all over the place. I could choose the next lowest Zag (valley) as an entry point (which is a scant 10 pips or so below current market price), but I think a bolder move may be in order, so I'm going to drill out to the 2H chart to see if a clearer picture emerges. One does: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So I am going to fashion an entry order to buy the pair should price strike the lower horizontal line (1.01213), with the target price being the higher one (1.01710). And that'll probably be it given my current exposure ... .

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Lastly, I'm going to scroll through the 4H charts with a 14 period RSI tacked on to see if there are any directional grid set-up's in the making. I usually like to take these where price may be near an inflection point (as indicated by the ZigZag) and the RSI indicates potential exhaustion of buyers (about the 70 line) or sellers (below the 30 line). Point in fact, one pair does meet this criteria (kinda), and that is AUD/NZD. The RSI has topped the 70 line and appears poised to retreat downward. I say "kinda" because price is now above the highest Zig (peak) on the 4H. Nevertheless, I think it is worth setting up a small short grid below current price in 10 pip increments starting at about 1.1210 ending at 1.1140, which would involve a decent amount of pippage if it retraces that much ... .

Holy cow -- a hot day here for September ... . Came in from working all day out in heat, laid down for a little bit to take a short nap ... . Four hours later, I wake up. So much for a short nap. In any event, my last open position for the week is likely to be that AUD/NZD short that was intended to be a grid trade, but didn't pan out. Although I usually play through economic announcements, tomorrow there is NFP's, and I'd prefer not getting caught up in something that turns out to be a total dog at the end of the week. I had to drill all the way down to a five minute chart to find a usable Zig (peak) which marks today's high at 1.1287, so I am going to fashion a good for day entry order to sell the pair should price strike that level.

I will add to that position should price strike the next highest Zig (peak). Unfortunately, with respect to a large number of pairs, we still have leftover impulsive movement from Thursday and Friday. I ordinarily stand aside from trading those pairs (virtually every EUR and GBP cross, it appears) until they have had time to digest the impulsive movement, but will nevertheless have a gander at them to see if anything pops out as worthwhile ... .

Oh my goodness ... . Cable in the process of tanking post-Scottish independence poll news ... . Kind of takes Cable crosses off the table for a bit ... . Virtually everything looks somewhat unattractive to me ... EUR and GBP impulsive movement post-Draghi, JPY crosses ripping higher ... . However, NZD/JPY might be a diamond in the ruff here ... . It is looking slightly rangey and differs in trajectory from other Yen crosses, all of which have been ripping higher for the past several weeks, so I'll fashion an entry order to go long should price strike the next lowest Zag (valley) on the 4H (which is around 86.687), and leave it at that for now ... . TP at 87.578.

In addition to that NZD/JPY long position, I figured I'd set up ZigZag entries using the 6H chart for entries that I would consider "ideal." These are good until cancelled entries that are meant to take advantage of longer-term swings (while I am waiting for last week's impulsive price movements to settle) and are at extremes of price action. I naturally hate doing nothing at all, but also don't want to make trades simply because I am bored ... : Attached Image On the other hand, sometimes it's best just to sit it out for a few days, sit back, relax, let the market sort itself out ... . This is probably one of those periods ... .

Speaking of boredom ... . I've been looking at EUR/TRY for quite a long time. Its positive swap on the short side is almost too much to resist, but the oddball pip cost (.05 per pip) and the onerous margin required to carry the pair (more than 2x most major pairs) has led me to hesitate entering a position. That being said, taking comparatively modest positions (.5 x equity) at price extremes might prove productive, so I'm going to set up some GTC entry orders to sell the pair should it strike extreme price points (as indicated by the ZigZag), like so: Attached Image I would note that, in light of Thursday's price movement in the Euro, EUR/TRY's price is quite distant from the first possible sell point, so an entry might take some time to develop ... .

AUD/NZD short position TP hit: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Between yesterday's Asian open and today's New York close, a couple of my ZigZag entry orders executed -- a EUR/GBP short at .80293/TP .79343 (3/5 x equity [the cost per pip of this pair is a bit oddball; I tried to make it as close as possible in cost to the other 1x equity positions]) and an NZD/USD long at .82791/TP .83430 (1 x equity). Total exposure is currently at 1.6 x equity/98.13% Usable Margin. As noted yesterday, I set up a bunch of GTC entry orders for entries at ZigZag extremes that I considered "ideal" based upon the ZigZag indicator showing in the 6H chart. I would note that I am still tweaking what time frame I should use for the entries and am yet unsure of whether the ZigZags that show on the 6H chart are the way to go for the type of trading I want to do, which is largely trades that I can get in and out of within a week or so (with the possible exception of trades I want to carry due to positive swap). What I will do is go through those orders now and tweak the entries if I think that is appropriate or to bring the entries closer to current price so that a profitable exit is achievable within a fairly short time frame (3-5 days). Naturally, the first thing I will look at adjusting will be the TP's of the open positions I have right now. Looking at the NZD/USD long TP, I'm thinking that where I've got it set right now is a bit ambitious for a trade that I want to get out of within the week, so I'm lowering it to .83269, which is a nearby Zig (peak) that is indicated on the 1H chart. I think that the EUR/GBP short TP is also overly ambitious, so I've moved that up to .79954 (a nearby Zag on the 1H). With respect to my remaining GTC entry orders, I am going to tweak the entries based upon the 4H chart, looking for nearby Zigs and Zags to modify my orders. Some I changed a little bit, some not at all, and some somewhat dramatically due in part to Cable's tumble yesterday. In any event, here's how the new orders came out: Attached Image And since the EUR/GBP short and the NZD/USD long orders were executed before the end of today's New York close, I am going to consider adding to those positions now. With respect to the NZD/USD long, I'm virtually at the lowest possible Zag (valley) from which to fashion an entry order, so I'm going to pass on adding to that position today. As far as the EUR/GBP short is concerned, I've already taken advantage of the highest local Zig (peak), but it's come off that level a bit, so I'll fashion a good for day entry order to sell at virtually the same peak I utilized before at around .8033-ish. Lastly, now that I exited the AUD/NZD short position, I may want to set up another short at the Zig (peak) that has formed at about 1.13, which I will go ahead and do with the TP being the nearest Zag (valley) at about 1.114.

My EUR/JPY short entry order has executed, along with a EUR/JPY short, and an EUR/GBP short addition with current open positions now as follows: AUD/USD 1x equity long at .92792/TP .93651 NZD/USD 1 x equity long at .82791/TP .83269 EUR/GBP 1.2 x equity short at .80293/TP .79554 EUR/JPY 1 x equity short at 137.385/TP 136.793 EUR/TRY .8 x equity short at 2.80822/TP 2.79697 Total Exposure: 5 x equity/91.27% Usable Margin Generally speaking, I only like to have between four and five total open positions at a time. This is to give me more than ample room to add to the positions if necessary without exposure getting out of hand. Consequently, I need to consider which pending entry orders I should delete at this time. The first ones I am going to delete are the Cable crosses. Cable is likely to be volatile in the next coming days, and I've already got the currency represented in my EUR/GBP short, which is probably all the exposure I want to the currency. Additionally, I am going to delete out the NZD/JPY long and the AUD/NZD short. I am in both AUD and NZD, and I'm not particularly attached to these trades. CAD is the only currency not represented in my current mix, so it is a contest between whether I want to keep the USD/CAD entry or the EUR/CAD entry. I generally favor the EUR/CAD over the USD/CAD, since EUR/CAD is better as a weak/strong pair, so I'll leave that one in the mix. The EUR/NZD and EUR/AUD shorts are reaching price points that I want to take advantage of and are good carry trades, so I'll keep those in the mix. With EUR/USD, I'm going to change my tactic with respect to that pair and use a directional grid below to take advantage of the pair's continued slide, which is likely to be a long-term event. I will continue to sell on bounces, but will employ the grid for the foreseeable future, as I envisage the pair declining substantially throughout the remainder of the year in light of the fact that the ECB is just beginning its easing measures.

My foray into the Lira is going to be interesting. It clearly will take some getting used to. In purely pip terms, the price appears to move dramatically with a current Daily ATR of about 240 pips. Price is currently 330 pips above my entry price, which I would ordinarily consider absolutely devastating were it one of the run-of-the-mill pairs like EUR/USD or USD/JPY. Fortunately, I considered this fact ahead of time, and my EUR/TRY position is proportionally smaller as compared to my other positions in light of its per pip cost, which is 1/2 what EUR/USD's is. But, again, I just can't resist the positive swap on the short side ... . Over $1.00 ... .

The Power (or Lack Thereof) Of Positive Rollover So I make a great to-do about positive rollover and choosing pairs and trade direction that will allow you to do that, and I virtually never trade in the direction of negative rollover unless it's so minor that it's not worth thinking about. (You might as well take advantage of it now; there will come a time when the carry trade becomes all but extinct but for emerging market pairs as various countries normalize their interest rates ... . Several years off, I know, in many cases ... .) Frankly, I haven't paid much attention to the precise contribution positive rollover makes to my profit, so I figured I'd crunch some numbers and see. Quarter to date, it appears that my overall profits were made up of about 3.34% net rollover/swap. That's not huge and could probably be improved were I to hold my positions longer (something I am unlikely to start doing). Additionally, toward the beginning of the quarter, I really didn't pay swap much attention until I got caught holding an NZD/USD short longer than I would like and began to realize just how much negative swap can eat into your profit, especially if you're shooting for relatively small gains out of a position.

To make room, it would be nice if I could get one of the open positions to close in net profit before the beginning of the New York session. For that reason, I've basically moved all of the target prices (with the exception of the EUR/TRY short and the EUR/USD short grid) to +15 pips to place myself on a more comfortable footing ... .

--- 帖子 #300 ---
... and when I say "clean up," I am putting it mildly. If you've read this thread, you'll probably already know that I'm testing the lot sizes that I am comfortable with as I move through the trading cycle in a particular pair with this particular system. Currently, it is at 1x equity per leg. Additionally, I am seeing how many pairs I can trade at once using this particular lot size and how far I can reasonable push the maximum exposure beyond 10 x equity without, in essence, driving myself batty. For one thing, I think I've honed in on the fact that I really don't want to have more than four open positions at any one time. In other words, I only want to be trading four pairs simultaneously, not only for exposure reasons, but because it keeps things simpler as I take those trades through their cycle. I am not only finding that 1 x equity per leg is proving a bit rich for my risk tolerance, but that pushing exposure beyond 10 x equity is uncomfortable. I'm always amazed by the folks who have live account Trade Explorers out there that show them exposed beyond 10 times, but that also show them continuing to be successful which leads me to wonder if it's just about developing a tolerance to that kind of exposure without going nuts. It's important to me to figure these things out with a small amount of money before I start using larger amounts of money. All of the open positions I've got now are in the red and intratrade the entire account is down (at the New York close when the spreads are ridiculous) more than 20%. Back in the day, I would panic now and close everything out at the earliest possible juncture to avoid compounding my losses. I have learned, however, that this is probably the stupidest thing one can do -- attempting to make an informed decision in a moment of panic and move to close positions at possibly the worst possible prices. Point in fact, sometimes the best thing to do is absolutely nothing (which is all I can do over the weekend, as markets are closed anyhow). My job in the coming days is to try to close these positions out in net profit, which may involve the exercise of a good deal of patience. Fortunately, some of these positions have good positive swap, which will allow me to wait, potentially several days if not weeks for good set-ups in the direction of my original trade to add to these positions or for them to hit their respective TP's (I am settling for +15 pips in the vast majority of cases at the moment: EUR/USD short at 1.28900 (Grid trade) AUD/USD long at .91892/TP .92042 NZD/USD long at .82251/TP .82401 EUR/JPY short at 137.987/TP 137.900 (Grid trade upon TP being hit) EUR/AUD short at 1.42349 (Grid trade) EUR/TRY short at 2.84192/TP 2.83000 (Carry trade) Wish me luck ... .

Pre-Weekly Open Current Open Positions EUR/USD short at 1.28900 (Grid trade) AUD/USD long at .91892/TP .92042 NZD/USD long at .82251/TP .82401 EUR/JPY short at 137.987/TP 137.900 (Grid trade upon TP being hit) EUR/AUD short at 1.42349 (Grid trade) EUR/TRY short at 2.84192/TP 2.83000 (Carry trade) Current Exposure: 16.2 x equity/63.32 Usable Margin Notes My first order of business is attempting to reduce my exposure. However, current price for most of my open positions is so far off from my net entry prices (with the possible exception of EUR/USD), that this is likely to take several days. On the 1H, only one pair has a higher Zig (or lower Zag) from which to fashion an entry, and that is EUR/USD (at about 1.28962), so I will naturally fashion an entry order to sell that pair should price strike that level. With respect to the remaining pairs, I have a couple of choices. I can either wait for price to settle and for Zigs and Zags to develop on the 1H or simply drill out to higher time frames in an attempt to spot good entries. AUD/USD long. With AUD/USD, I literally have to drill all the way out to the Daily chart to find a lower Zag (not a good sign), and it is at about .8910. NZD/USD long. With NZD/USD, I similarly have to drill all the way out to the Daily, with the next Zag below around .8100. EUR/AUD short. The next highest Zig on the Daily is at about 1.44553; the next highest, at about 1.45806 ... . EUR/JPY short. The next highest Zig on the Daily is just short of 140.00, at 139.9 or so. EUR/TRY short. The next highest Daily Zig is at just about 2.9200. The other question is what lot size should I use in light of my current exposure. Should I continue to use the 1x equity legs, or a different size? Naturally, were I to have endless equity, I would just keep on adding to the positions in like-size lot sizes at favorable junctures until price moved in the direction of my original trade. Unfortunately, I do not have that luxury here (i.e., neither my equity nor my margin are endless), so I am going to dramatically reduce the size of my legs because I anticipate that it is likely to take several days (if not a couple weeks in some cases, ugh), to clear these positions. Naturally, should I be able to close certain positions, that will free up equity, and I can examine the lot size question again at that juncture. I would note that having this number of "dogs" open at one time is somewhat unprecedented. Ordinarily, if one dog develops during a trading week, I stop opening new positions in other pairs until that dog is cleared in order to avoid this very situation from developing. In that regard, I guess the dramatic movement downward in the Aussie, along with the substantial weakening of the Yen caught me somewhat flat-footed. Oh well, live and learn ... .

I've still got the EUR/USD short grid set below my current TP for my open position, starting at 1.288 and going all the way down to 1.25 for now.

While I'm waiting for my open positions' TP's to hit, I generally go through the charts, mark them up, and see where I would want to enter a position with certain trades, usually more long-term propositions than Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point entries (which look to catch intraday movement). One of the ones I frequently look at is GBP/JPY, since it's a mover and can make for quick profit assuming that you can catch it at the right juncture. With the Scottish independence vote right around the corner, I'm pretty much staying out of Cable for the time being, but I may want to wade into the pair after that settles because, like USD/JPY, the BOE is tightening and the BOJ is easing, meaning that it is likely that the pair will continue higher for some time to come, although it is likely that it will continue to gyrate violently between price action levels as it has done in the past. So, here is the pair on the 4H: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ideally, I would like to initiate a long position around 170.50, which is confluence of a couple of Fib lines, as well as well-tested support (but for the impulsive penetration of this area earlier this month). This opportunity might occur post Scottish vote, depending on the way it goes. A less aggressive option would be to pursue an entry between 171.80 and 172.00, which is the .5 Fib line from the 7/15 high to the 9/8 low ... .

AUD/USD: Will .9080 Become Support Post-PBOC Announcement of 500 Bil. Yuan SLF Program? If you've been following the markets at all, you'll know that AUD/USD is processing a significant tumble, but has recovered somewhat today from lows near .9000 on news that the PBOC is rolling out what, in essence, is an easing program worth 500 billion Yuan, presumably to keep the Chinese economy trundling forward at an ungodly rate. The Australian economy has close ties with the Chinese, so what's good for the Chinese economy generally turns out to be good for the Aussies. In any event, I went long AUD/USD around .9200 (foolish at this point, I know, given increasing dollar strength). Now, however, AUD/USD is above .9080, the .382 Fib line from the 10/23/13 high (.9758) to the 1/24/14 low (.8660): Attached Image (click to enlarge) My take on it is that the PBOC program is pretty major. Unlike the Japanese, who have fiddled around for literally decades with various economic mechanisms (some of which are, quite frankly, bizarre [i.e., raising taxes to combat deflation]) and take a very measured approach (that is being kind), it is apparent that the Chinese will not hesitate to pull the trigger if things are out of whack with where they want to be yesterday. That being said, FOMC is right around the corner, and I fully expect another ding (temporary or otherwise) in AUD/USD's armor after policy wonks interpret the crap out of Janet Yellen's statements and prognosticate as to when the Fed will begin to raise interest rates. Long-term, though, I expect a turnaround in the currency as the PBOC program works its way through the Chinese economy ... . Would I buy here were I not already long? Probs not, but I would keep an eye out for signs of a turnaround (and buying opportunities) after the FOMC dust settles ... .

First, the good news: The EUR/USD net position consisting of a grid trade added onto with ZigZag inspired entries, struck its TP, and then price drilled through three levels of the grid: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The bad news is that movement did not translate across to my other EUR crosses -- my EUR/JPY short, EUR/AUD short, and my EUR/TRY short carry trade, all of which are up from the New York open until now. Moreover USD strength post-FOMC motivated my AUD/USD and NZD/USD longs to plummet, and they're beginning to look like long-term carry trades more than the short in-and-outs of 3-5 days or less I like to see. But the good news is that all of these trades, with the exception of the EUR/JPY short, has positive rollover/swap, so I need to exhibit a little patience and watch for opportunities in these pairs that favor the direction of my original trade and afford me a chance to get out net positive.

This week's results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Every single pip was from a EUR/USD short. That being said, still got a pre-FOMC week mess consisting of an NZD/USD long, an AUD/USD long, a EUR/AUD short, and a EUR/JPY short. I'm kind of enjoying the positive rollover on that EUR/TRY short, so I'm glad I didn't set the TP so tight that it hit it this week. Nevertheless, with that particular position, I don't want it to get overly large and want to keep the TP around 100 pips of market price if possible. If necessary, I'll close it out if it get oversized, and then reload it at appropriate junctures in price.

I'm probably not going to be getting into many new positions as I work to clear my AUD/USD long, NZD/USD long, EUR/AUD short, EUR/JPY short, and EUR/TRY short (a carry trade which I am not sure I want to clear necessarily), but I thought I'd go through my regular analysis to see what looks good and whether there is anything that is just too good to pass up. However, I think that post-FOMC (and, to a lesser extent, post-Scottish independence vote), the market has some settling to do, so it may be best to sideline oneself for a few days for all but the most short-term scalping set-up's that you can get in and out of in short order. The Majors EUR/USD : Below/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. What can you say? The long-term sentiment is bearish, and I will be selling on bounces, as well as taking advantage of a grid below once my max exposure permits it. The nearest Zig (peak) above current price is around 1.2925 and would consider fashioning a sell entry should price strike that level. GBP/USD : Above/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. Post-Scottish independence vote, the pair has some settling to do. Although the pair appears to have made a higher low and higher higher on a very short-term basis (1H), it is unclear whether a new higher low is forming ... . Frankly, I would look to other Cable crosses to trade Cable that pit potential BOE tightening against another currency Central Bank's easing regime (e.g., EUR/GBP or GBP/JPY). AUD/USD : Below/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. This pair is in the crapper. That being said, price is hovering around the 2014 low of about .8900 so caution might be in order should you still be inclined to continue to short the pair. I personally think that the recent drop may be overdone, but that is just a gut assessment that is not really based on technical/fundamental analysis (although the Daily RSI says "oversold"). NZD/USD : Below/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. Price is not all that far away from the 2014 low of .8066. As with AUD/USD, the Daily RSI points to oversold conditions. USD/JPY : Above/Above 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. Regrettably, I bailed out of the low end of this pair's rip around 103. Now I don't know what to make of the pair. The SMA says keep on buying, but the pair is at a 2014 high and has wicked through the 200 month (yes, month) SMA at 106.508 and doesn't show a great deal of signs of a pull back, at least at this moment in time. The Daily and Weekly show overbought conditions ... . I would look to other Yen crosses ... . (However, most of the other Yen crosses -- CAD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY have exhibited the same sort of rippage ... .) USD/CAD : Above/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. For some reason, I just don't like to trade this pair too much, generally favoring a more strong/weak pair such as EUR/CAD to trade the Loonie. But it may be ranging a bit in the short term, so it might be worthwhile to look at shorting from the top of the purple box (around 1.030) with a TP around the bottom 1.0930. That being said, the light blue box is an area of concern, since price has broken out of the purple range fairly recently: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Other Pairs of Interest EUR/CAD : Below/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. As with EUR/USD, I am long-term bearish on this pair and look to sell on bounces. That being said, Loonie data is a tad bit more erratic than US data, so the pair is subject to greater movement because of that. EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD : Above/Above 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. Because I think the decline of AUD and NZD are overdone, I am looking for AUD and NZD bounces pitted against long-term Euro weakness and am looking to enter short at price extremes as exhibited by the ZigZag. I generally prefer EUR/NZD short over EUR/AUD short due to positive swap associated with the latter pair; unfortunately, I am already in EUR/AUD short ... . I would look at a EUR/NZD short as a possible carry trade with comparatively small entries made over time at price extremes with the intent to hold the pair for a period of time (in excess of a week) to take advantage of the positive swap. EUR/GBP : Below/Below 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. Recent Cable movement has made this pair a bit wilder than ordinary (it is usually a calm affair with minimal movement, making for nice, small pip scalping), allowing it to break out of the range it has been in since late June: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price is now butting up against the bottom of that previous range, and the question becomes whether its being below this range is a temporary matter or whether a new range is now going to form ... , so I would keep an eye on that former support at .7877 to see how price reacts ... . EUR/TRY : Above/Above 1H/6H 200 Period SMA. The attractiveness of this pair is its long-term carry potential on the short side. Last week, I expected greater Lira strength (and therefore pair weakness post-FOMC), something that did not materialize, which is okay, since I want to be in the pair as long as possible without the exposure created by the position becoming unduly large (in which case I will look to exit the net position at a suitable point and then reload). The pair has fallen into a short-term range with 2.8820 being the approximate roof and 2.530 being the floor, so I will look to add to the position around the ceiling: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Like any other carry trade, I look to use comparatively small positions for entries over time ... . USD/RUB : This is another carry trade I have been looking at for quite some time; there are other pairs with better positive swap, but I also think that this pair has huge potential to the downside if the crisis in Ukraine resolves (which may not occur for some time). That being said, the pair could continue to move substantially higher before a RCB intervention occurs to inflate the Ruble's value, thus driving the pair lower. See USD/RUB Posts, http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...37#post7743037 I am looking particularly at a short entry at about 40.00, which currently in the vicinity of the Daily Classic R3.

I am way more exposed than I would like to be and am not going to open any new positions in any other pairs until I clear this deck (with the possible exception of the EUR/TRY carry). Given the current exposure (16.8 x equity), I am going to do this one pair at a time, focusing on what I think is the easiest pair to exit in a profitable way the soonest and then moving onto other pairs as the exposure is reduced. In this particular case, it is a close race between the NZD/USD long (a 3.2 x equity position) and the EUR/AUD short (a 2.4 x equity position), but I think I will first focus on the EUR/AUD short (I have an affinity to holding the NZD/USD long as long as possible due to positive swap), and I will fashion a good for day entry order to add to the position should price strike the next highest Zig, which is around 1.4433 ... .

Well, I decided to close everything out, except for my EUR/TRY carry position at a point at which I was break even for the quarter -- the cost of my forex trading education, as one old codger here has put it. Things were getting far too exposed, I had opened up positions in far too many pairs, and 1x equity per leg was clearly not the way to go with that number of pairs open when you're stuck with 50:1 margin. But, hey, that's what I wanted to find out by pushing the per leg limit as far as I could. I think the way to go is with .25 x equity per leg, max four pairs open, and no doubling on currencies, as tempting as that might be. So, back to the extremely conservative square I was originally on ... . That being said, there is an extremely good short grid opportunity with GBP/NZD ... . I am setting up the grid in 10 pip increments below current price. If you end up with a dangling position, the pair is great in terms of positive swap, so you can hold onto it and not sweat it too much. Also, that EUR/TRY short is turning out fantastically (one bright spot) as a carry trade with entries using the ZigZag indicator.

Three Good Carry Trades Worth Holding Ordinarily, I enjoy getting into and out of trades as quickly as possible -- in 3-5 days or less. That being said, there are also times when nothing looks particularly attractive to me in the market or when I just don't have a great deal of time or energy to devote to pouring over charts to look for ideal trade set ups. That's when I turn to carry trades to keep me entertained, and there are at least three good carry trades worth holding for substantial periods of time to take advantage of positive swap without doing a great deal -- GBP/NZD short, EUR/TRY short, and USD/CNH short. You'll see by the screenshot here that they enjoy a good deal of positive swap on the short side: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Your goal with carry trades is to acquire positions slowly and over time at price extremes and then to hold the net position as long as possible (without going crazy on exposure) to take advantage of the positive swap/rollover. For this, I use the ZigZag indicator to tell me when those points are reached, with each of the purple ovals potential areas where I would fashion an entry order to sell the pair should price strike that level: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Similarly, I use the ZigZag's to assist me in setting a reasonable target price for the net position, shown by the horizontal blue line here: Attached Image (click to enlarge) (I have set my TP here, since this is where I would be profitable for the net position; I also don't want to set the TP too close and have it hit too soon, since I want to carry this trade as long as possible without getting ridiculous with the size of the position). Keep in mind that some of the per pip charges for these pairs are somewhat unusual and that your lot sizes may not be what you're used to dealing with and will require adjustment. For example, the per pip cost of a USD/CNH position is .02 per pip, whereas most other pairs are .10 per pip. Additionally, margin requirements are likely to be different for these pairs as compared to majors: the margin used for USD/CNH is 50.0 per pip compared to EUR/USD's 32 per pip (for my broker; yours may differ).

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Alright, back to basics ... . I'm basically going to focus on what I started out with some weeks ago, which is I will look at having an equal balance in EUR, GBP, JPY, and CAD to the extent possible. It's not looking like AUD or NZD are on the horizon as potential trades for me, as I only like those long (and they've tanked as of late). Price in Relation to 200 SMA on 1H/6H (Pairs that Are Consistent Are in Bold) CAD/JPY Above/Below EUR/CAD Below/Below EUR/GBP Below/Below EUR/JPY Below/Above EUR/USD Below/Below GBP/CAD Above/At or Near Below GBP/JPY Above/Above GBP/USD At or Near Below/Below USD/CAD Above/Above USD/JPY Above/Above Well, there's quite a bit to choose from ... . Ordinarily, I would go straight for EUR/USD, but EUR/CAD offers a slightly more positive swap and is a little bit more "bouncy" than EUR/USD is at the moment. And although I'm slightly on the fence about it, I think I will also enter GBP/USD short. The Yen is somewhat troubling at the moment for my purposes, since it appears to be undergoing a correction in many pairs after weakening substantially and then strengthening modestly. Naturally, I will consider getting into a Yen cross going forward, but today is not the day I'll be doing that or, in the alternative, I'll be looking at scalping a Yen cross as an extremely short-term play. So, these will be my good for day entry orders using .5 x equity legs: EUR/CAD short at the .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point/TP .236 Pivot GBP/USD short at the .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point/TP .236 Pivot

And this is what overexposure and the ensuing panic does to your equity ... . Lol. (Laughing on the outside; crying on the in ... .) Two months of work down the pooper in a week all because I wanted to see how far I could push it: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... My guess ... a bit too far ... . That being said, no experiment is a failure unless you don't learn anything from it. 1 x equity per leg is too big for the way I do things unless I'm going to confine myself to less than four, non-correlated pairs at a time. .5 x equity per leg is great, but .25 x equity is the most stress-free/comfortable. And ... watch the total exposure ... . The 10 x equity rule of thumb for total exposure is a good rule, especially when you've only got 50:1 margin to work with (eyes 200:1 margins enviously). Back next week, ready to continue the experimentation!!!! Mwah hah hah hah.

Despite the final failure (which was due to getting involved NZD and AUD long right before they tanked [Why'd I do that again?]), there were some bright spots this quarter, like EUR/USD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... USD/JPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... and GBP/USD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... which kinda makes me wonder why I am always fishing around for good pairs to trade. Just do the majors and you'll do fine (as long as you don't try to call a top or bottom).

--- 帖子 #330 ---
And ... just ... one ... last ... thing ... . I love the directional grids, especially where we've had the kind of movement we've had recently. When the trend is your friend and you can easily identify that trend, grids capture movement for impatient traders like me who want to lock in profit as the pair ascends/descends its trajectory and impose minimum demands as to the timing of the entry especially if you've missed a more ideal entry point. (I know, I know. A lot of folks poo-poo the grids as no brainer, "0" analysis trading for the weak-minded ... .) One of the drawbacks, I know, is the dangling trade when the trend temporarily peters out and the pair falls into a short-term range or consolidation, but that is a good point at which to apply the pivot points and or ZigZag indicator to capture that range/consolidative movement before the trend resumes (or reverses). (An additional drawback is the fact that, with each level in the grid, you are handing over a spread fee to your broker, which over the course of a 50-level grid (500 pips), can be quite significant. Alternatively, you can just close out that last dangler at a small loss or at break even, knowing that the trend of which you were taking advantage has been temporarily paused. Personally, I kind of value "the dangler," though. It importantly tells me that "Hey, price is taking a breather here. You may want to reevaluate the trend, check S/R, etc., and see whether we can continue this way or whether our love affair is over."

Current Open Positions EUR/USD Short at 1.26800 (Grid Trade): This is the dangler left over at the pair's pause at this level on Friday. The grid remains in place at 1.267 and below all the way down to 1.265 for the time being. I will add to the position should price strike the .764 or the next highest Zig to catch any bounces the pair might experience. USD/JPY Long at 109.40 (Grid Trade)/TP 109.5: This is also a dangler left over at the pair's pause at this level on Friday. I have deleted the remainder of the grid to the upside; the pair appears to be moving sideways in the short term. I will add to the position should price strike the .236 or next lowest Zag to catch any dips the pair might experience and will reconsider a grid to the long side should it become apparent that it is done ranging. GBP/NZD Short at 2.06145/TP 2.0610: This was probably an ill-advised scalp that goes against the trend and was intended to take advantage of intraday movement. Penders GBP/USD Short Grid: I have set up a grid to catch movement to the downside from 2.624 at the way down to 2.61.

Was expecting a little bit more movement today, but no grid levels struck ... . Mmmm. That's not very entertaining. So I've still got the same basic grids in place -- EUR/USD short and GBP/USD short. I decided to reinstate the USD/JPY long grid ... . I've got danglers left over from those, and I will add to the positions should price strike the .764 for the shorts or the .236 for the long. I also decided to do a measured risk USD/RUB short at 39.172/TP 38.562, which is designed to be a long-term carry trade which I will add to from time to time at price extremes. The pair currently has a bullish trajectory, but is capable of dramatic retracements and somewhat unanticipated major wicking. (I had to turn away from NZD long carry trades due to the volatility that the Kiwi is currently engaged in, making it unattractive for carry trade purposes). I may work to wrap things up before the end of the quarter here as best as possible; weird stuff seems to happen at the end of the quarter/beginning of the next, and I generally like to sit it out for a few days for things to settle before diving in again. Could use a break in any event ... . Current Exposure 3.75 x equity/92.78% Usable Margin/85.55% Usable Maintenance Margin

GBP/USD TP Hit: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
So, after getting burned a bit last week with NZD and AUD, I figured I'd attempt to calm down a bit and use some basic common sense. One of these common sense tactics is to set a stop when the position is in profit and make it a break even proposition when it is possible to do so. I can still add to the position at price extremes assuming that the pair continues the trajectory I originally got into the trade for in the first instance, and this will free up exposure to make plays in other pairs without going overboard. So, here is an example of this -- EUR/USD (which started out as a grid trade): Attached Image (click to enlarge) The entry was at 1.26697 and it is currently in the green by 40 pips or so. An SL has been set at 1.2669, and I will just let the trade run at this point, adding to the position should the pair continue down, as I am now basically playing with house money ... .

They are based on 4H time frame ZigZags in the vast majority of instances. The carry trade entries are made using .25 x equity or less with the expectation that they will be long-term holds and will be added to over time to take advantage of positive swap. With respect to the USD/RUB short in particular, this is a contrarian, measured risk position (i.e., a pure unadulterated gamble). The technicals indicate a bullish trend. However, the pair is at historic highs and is amenable in part to news-based movement relating to the conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, the Ruble is subject to Russian Central Bank intervention at certain junctures if the Ruble weakens more than is desirable. I've posted quite a bit about the Ruble on the USD/RUB thread, and you can see where I'm coming from with respect to this currency there. Similarly, the EUR/NZD short carry is probable going to prove to be undesirable, especially in light of the BNZ's "goldilocks" statement, which may push the pair higher.

Most of my entries are working out smashingly at this moment in time, allowing me to place stop losses at +10 in virtually all my open positions except for the GBP/JPY long, the USD/RUB short, and the USD/JPY long position which executed while I was at a meeting: AUD/NZD Short at 1.12236/Trailing SL (TP 1.09400) CAD/JPY Long at 97.752/Trailing SL (TP 99.682) EUR/AUD Short at 1.45458/Trailing SL (No Target) EUR/NZD Short at 1.61536/Trailing SL GBP/JPY Long at 177.281/No SL (TP 178.613) USD/JPY Long at 108.592/No SL (TP 112.50) USD/RUB Short at 39.172/No SL (TP 36.00) The essentially means that the positions in which I was able to place a stop are now all at least +10 pip propositions and are risk-free.

Well, I am always game for using new tools to potentially refine my view of trade direction, and one of those tools would be the PSAR. For example, if you look at EUR/USD using the PSAR, this is the picture you get: Monthly: Down Weekly: Down Daily: Down 4H: Down 1H: Down Obviously the trend is down on virtually every time frame, although you'll notice that there is some "up" among the "downs" on the 1H chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... which could arguably make the PSAR a good tool to reinforce scalp entries (and exits) on lower time frames. In any event, here's what the PSAR shows for the major pairs on the above-time frames (with inconsistent direction indicated in bold and predominant direction underlined): EUR/USD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Down GBP/USD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Down USD/JPY M/Up W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Up USD/CHF M/UP W/Up D/Up 4H/Up 1H/Up USD/CAD M/Up W/Up D/Up 4H/Up 1H/Up AUD/USD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Down (But Waffling Between Up and Down on 4H/1H) NZD/USD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Down (But Waffling Between Up and Down on 4H/1H) Obviously, the predominant theme is to continue to go long dollar. ... and for other, selected pairs ... : EUR/GBP M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Down EUR/JPY M/Down W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Down GBP/JPY M/Up W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Down EUR/AUD M/Down W/Up D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Up EUR/CAD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Down CAD/JPY M/Up W/Down D/Up 4H/Up 1H/Up GBP/CAD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Up AUD/NZD M/Up W/Down D/Up 4H/Down 1H/Up EUR/NZD M/Down W/Up D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Up GBP/AUD M/Down W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Up GBP/NZD M/Up W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Up Well, you get the picture ... . With those pairs that show inconsistency, you're naturally going to want to look at S/R or the ZigZag to see if they're falling into a range; whether the strength of the trend, for one reason or another, is petering out; or whether the pair is taking a dip/bounce that would make for a good entry.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
So here are my GTC penders that are based upon the 3H ZigZag: Attached Image I would note that at least one trade could be considered contrarian -- the AUD/NZD short. On the Monthly, Daily, and Hourly Charts the PSAR is up; it is down on the Weekly and 4H. Looking at the chart, however, it appears that this swing back and forth with direction using the PSAR on various time frames may be indicative of a range: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Obviously, it is both sloppy and short-term, so I lack a huge degree of confidence in the position, but it's enough to give it a shot ... .

However, everything will now work out fine, since -- at worst -- it is a break even proposition. I was hoping to add an entry to the GBP/JPY long that was a little bit closer to current price than the entry order I've got now (at 173.153), but no Zag has yet formed closer to current price with which I can fashion an entry.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
And here are my penders based on the 3H Zig Zag indicator: Attached Image There are a few changes from yesterday. For instance, I decided to delete the EUR/JPY entry, as I'm kind of torn as to the direction it's heading. It could be falling back into its August range, but it's hard to determine at this point. Additionally, once the AUD/NZD short I've got open now closes out, I've deleted out additional positions in the pair (as much fun as it's been ... ). ... And the GBP/CHF position is kind of an afterthought ... .

--- 帖子 #357 ---
... and just as I was writing that last post, AUD/NZD (the stop for which I changed to a dynamic trailing), stopped out for a small profit: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Current Exposure: 4.35 x Equity (4.35 x equity at risk/0 x equity no risk) Usable Margin 92.40%/Usable Maintenance Margin 84.81% Current Intratrade Drawdown: 2.63%

It is possible that EUR/JPY is reverting to the August range here ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... motivating me to set up a short entry order for the pair should price strike 137.75 (the next highest Zig). I also notice that price has temporarily been unable to clear the .384 Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Point, which would have been a good scalp were I to have had eyes on the chart ... .

--- 帖子 #359 ---
AUD/NZD has proved entertaining due to its volatility, and is poised to test the September 5th and 8th highs: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So, I'm going to fashion an entry order to short the pair should price strike what is currently the 1 line of the Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Points (last week's high and the next highest Zig) with a target price of about 1.11300.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Now that my exposure plate is pretty much full, I'm going to delete out most of my penders for pairs other than the ones I've got open now, with a couple of exceptions. Borrowing a page from Hayseed, I'm going to begin accruing short positions in EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD, and EUR/CAD using the ZigZag indicator and, borrowing a page from Allirajaje (think I spelled that right; he's got a couple of high impact explorers called Persian Gulf (which I can't access now to check the spelling; server's down)), I am going to be accruing short positions in GBP/CAD. Hayseed, if I understand it correctly, basically uses mean reversion, and Allirajaje hedges, but best as I can tell, uses ZigZag's for his entries. For good measure, however, I am also going to use mean reversion/ZigZag entries for a EUR/TRY short carry position, as well as for EUR/USD. The other positions I will dispose of with patience and additions at favorable prices as indicated by the ZigZag in order to be able to exit the positions net positive. (In case you're wondering, the basic notion of mean reversion is that prices will eventually move back toward the average or mean over time and so you attempt to enter trades at price extremes with that notion in mind.) That being said, here's what I've got open now: CAD/JPY Long at 97.236/No Stop (TP 97.764) EUR/CAD Short at 1.41493/No Stop (TP 1.39113) EUR/GBP Short at .78257/No Stop (TP .78155) EUR/TRY Short at 2.88041/No Stop (TP 2.80000) EUR/USD Short at 1.26400/No Stop (TP 1.20000) GBP/CHF Long at 1.54240/No Stop (TP 1.54500) GBP/JPY Long at 177.281/No Stop (TP 178.053) USD/JPY Long at 108.582/No Stop (TP 109.302) USD/RUB Short at 39.471/No Stop (TP 38.395) Current Exposure: 6.94 x Equity (6.94 x equity at risk/0 x equity no risk) Usable Margin 87.75%/Usable Maintenance Margin 75.50% Current Intratrade Drawdown: 5.0% Notes I would note that my GBP/JPY long is severely off its entry price (by greater than 300 pips) (Yen crosses took a beating last night if you were long and expecting further Yen weakness). Naturally, were I to have an unduly large lot size for that trade, I would be in something of a panic. That is, after all, relatively huge movement no matter which way you cut it (GBP/JPY is not referred to as "the widowmaker" for nothing, after all). However, with a strategy that anticipates multiple entries over time (regardless of whether you use Pivot Points, ZigZag's or some other indicator or tool), the key to working your way through that intratrade drawdown/adverse movement on your way to a profitable net position is extremely small lot sizes, preferably less than .5 x equity per leg of the position, as well as an uncanny amount of patience. It is now entirely possible that I will have to hold that position for several weeks, making additional, more favorable entries before price returns to its mean and before I can exit the position net profitable. In case you're wondering, the monthly mean (as shown by the Monthly Camarilla Pivot Point) for GBP/JPY is currently at 177.805, and I bought slightly below the mean ... .

--- 帖子 #361 ---
It is kind of interesting how longer-term means (such as the one based on the Monthly or Weekly charts as calculated by their corresponding Camarilla Pivot Points), can create congestion as traders decide direction. You can clearly see the congestion around those points on the GBP/JPY chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I would note that those means are the previous month's and previous week's means or, in the case of the Daily, the previous day's mean.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
The alternative way to look at means is by use of Fibs, with the .5 line being the mean for the range ... . For example, EUR/USD's monthly chart shows that 1.2145 is the midpoint from the 7/1/2008 range high to the 10/1/2000 range low: Attached Image (click to enlarge) On a shorter term basis, however, a literal "reversion to mean" is clearly not in play; it is below the .5 Fib line on the Weekly (at about 1.3510) and has made little effort to return to "mean" since the beginning of 2014: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In that sense (i.e., returning to the actual mean for the range or over a given time period), I don't see "reversion to mean" from a literalistic perspective -- that is, that price will return to the average price over a given period or even to an average price for a given range. Rather, I look at it as the notion that the pair, although undergoing dips and bounces over a period of time, will return to the overall "mean" or prevailing trend.

Wow, it looks like there were some fireworks today while I was at my day job. I did manage to dispose of my CAD/JPY, USD/JPY, and GBP/CHF longs for a small net profit on their respective positions, and a bunch of penders based on the ZigZag filled as price apparently pounded through EUR/CAD ZigZag levels, and -- to a lesser extent -- EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD only to retrace ... : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Unfortunately, however, I still have a few "problem children" -- a EUR/GBP short, a USD/RUB short (which I am growing less and less enthusiastic about by the day as a carry trade, but I went into it knowing that it might be a very long-term proposition), and a GBP/JPY long, which I would like to dispose of as soon as I can do so at a profitable juncture (although that EUR/GBP short might be a good mean reversion trade now that we've got some sort of retracement out of the Euro, which was far too long in the making [in my humble opinion]).

One drawback (I guess) of the way I'm doing things here is waiting for the rollover to accrue. As a general matter, rollover accrues daily; except for the weekend rollover for Saturday and Sunday, which doesn't accrue (for some strange reason) until Wednesday, at least with the broker I'm using. So, to a certain extent, in order to maximize rollover for certain pairs (like EUR/NZD short), I'm going to have to wait until Wednesday for the best rollover to accrue. Now naturally, I'm not going to wait until then if I want to close the position out before Wednesday because I want to capture gains ... .

Pre-Sydney Open PSAR Outlook -- Majors AUD/USD M/Down W/Down D/Up 4H/Down 1H/Down EUR/USD M/Down W/Down D/Up 4H/Down 1H/Down EUR/JPY M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Down GBP/USD M/Down W/Down D/Down 4H/Down 1H/Down NZD/USD M/Down W/Down D/Up 4H/Down 1H/Down USD/CAD M//Up W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Up USD/JPY M/Up W/Up D/Down 4H/Up 1H/Down As you can see, there is a predominant theme in place with respect to the dollar -- some weakness in the Greenback was experienced last week, offering opportunities to get in on bounces or dips to ride the longer term wave, which for the time being remains one of Greenback strength. On shorter time frames, the vast majority of major pairs resumed the predominant theme, although it remains to be seen whether this week will offer more of the same. AUD/USD is near its yearly low of .866, which may provide some temporary resistance. I generally don't trade this pair normally, opting instead to trade other Aussie crosses such as EUR/AUD, where Euro weakness may provide a cap of sorts to further Aussie weakness, if that occurs. EUR/USD may be at ZigZag indicated resistance (Daily; 1/12/12 low), with the next major Zag below at 1.2050. I am pretty much in the camp that continues to sell on bounces; last week's retracement was a welcome opportunity to get in short again. EUR/JPY is right at its yearly low, making me regret not shorting it higher. I would hesitate to get in short here unless it's on a bounce, as I'd like to see whether it moves decisively past the 8/8 low. GBP/USD is also right at ZigZag indicated resistance set on 9/10 shortly before the Scottish independence vote, with the next Zag lower on the Daily shown at 1.586. I am kind of neutral on this pair, at least for the time being. But would continue to short on 4H+ time frames if there is a substantial bounce of which to take advantage (which there was last week). NZD/USD's next ZZ low is at about .77 as shown on the weekly. Like AUD/USD, I generally opt not to trade this pair, choosing instead to trade EUR/NZD, where -- like EUR/AUD, Euro weakness provides a dampening cap on the Kiwi's movement. USD/CAD is nearly at its yearly high set back in March, making it unattractive to dive in long at this point. The Loonie is another currency that I chose to trade in tandem with currencies besides the Greenback, such as EUR/CAD or GBP/CAD. USD/JPY's next Zag below is at 106.9. I am not currently in the pair, but might look at getting in long again at this juncture, since it is a bit off that 110 high ... .

Most of the ZigZag-based entries I have in the Trade Explorer appear to still be good, so I've pretty much left them alone. One thing I wanted to adhere to was a .25 x equity per leg size, so I reduced the leg sizes to 50/4 = 12.5 (rounded down to 12 microlots per leg) for trades going forward. The idea is to start to compound at the beginning of each month based on the equity that exists at that time. So, for the first month, the leg sizes will be 12 microlots. Assuming that I am able to hit 6%, this would bring equity up to $53,000, and I would increase leg size to 13 microlots (53/4 = 13.25) and so on and so forth ... . I am halfway to 6% already for this month, but that is due to the first test trade for the Explorer (which was a humungous 15 standard lot trade that lasted all of 4 minutes and garnished 12.8 pips ... [way to mess up the stats, bro ...]). A USD/JPY long entry was added to buy if price hits 106.88 ... .

An interesting article ...: http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;id=508152 Although the article focuses on the Yen, there is also cause for concern from a fundamental standpoint that U.S. equities markets will undergo the modest correction/slump they have cyclically experienced during mid-term elections. http://blog.wrapmanager.com/how-mid-...e-stock-market In my view, however, this particular U.S. mid-term election cycle may produce more than average correction for a couple of reasons. First of all, the mid-term election this cycle happens to be coinciding with the end of the Fed's QE, which arguably made more cheap money available to investors to invest in the market than they would have ordinarily. Secondarily, this cheap money has contributed to what some have described as a speculative bubble in U.S. equities markets. While some have continued to assert that the market is "fairly valued" or, at least, not overvalued in terms of profit-to-earnings ratios, there is no denying the fact that equities are at or near all time highs and that a correction of some kind is overdue. In my mind, this correction is -- like all the post-speculative bubble corrections that have come before it -- likely to be substantial as investors who got caught up in the "irrational exuberance" late in the game panic and dump their holdings in just as an irrational manner as they acquired them. This is why I have elected to park my employment-based retirement funds in something other than equities for the moment; I just can't stand buying into funds at some of the most expensive share values that the equities-based funds have experienced. It is not beyond contemplation that a 7-10% correction in the S&amp;P 500 could occur in the weeks leading up to the election, as well as shortly thereafter as the markets muddle through the implications of what has occurred which run the gambit from the status quo (the Democrats remain in control of the Senate by virtually the same number of seats as before the election; the Republicans, the House) to a virtual sea change (the Democrats lose the Senate; the Republicans gain a substantial number of seats in the House). A substantial slump in U.S. equities markets could result in lower demand for the Greenback as investors look to other places in which to park their cash, and the wind behind the sails of the U.S. dollar could soon become dead air, with all the long-term prognostications that, for example, envisage a Euro at parity with the dollar a thing of the past.

In the attached example, the TP has been set at 1.82311, although 1.829-ish would also be a good TP, since it is the next lowest Zag (valley) below the entry.

Now that Cable thoroughly tanked last night, it is probably time to go in and modify existing orders and Target Prices with that in mind, so I've tweaked those and they should appear in the Demo TE shortly.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I fully realize that some of these are now pipe dreams given the Cable slump: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In particular, the GBP/NZD (which the Demo profited from nicely) and the GBP/AUD entries are quite a bit above current price. That's okay; you never know when some kind of violent price movement might occur that might hit those.

In preparation for transitioning to MT4 (if that's what I eventually decide to do; I'll make that decision in the next couple of months), I'm winding down my Trading Station live account. MT4 takes some getting used to. As a graphical user interface, it leaves something to be desired as compared to Trading Station (the web-based one, which I am forced to use because I'm a Mac user). For instance, one of the features I value in TS is the fact that you can set entries on the chart. You can naturally do that also in MT4, but it seems that once you set the entry price and the target price, if you want to move the entry, the target price moves with it, which is a somewhat annoying feature. If anything, you should be able to move these levels independently of one another, and you should be able to enter the order by clicking on the side of the chart as you do with Trading Station; in order to enter a new order in MT4, you have to click on the "New Order" button, squint at the chart for the price at the level you desire, and then manually enter the entry and TP prices, which is kind of a drag. Additionally, I frequently take multiple legs in a pair to build a position. Unfortunately, while TS groups these entries together as a "net position," MT4 doesn't. I'd like to know by glancing at the platform whether the net position is in positive territory in order to adjust my stop loss for the net position if that's what I'm going to do. MT4 makes me calculate that manually, which is a total drag. I imagine it's fine if you're a single entry trader, but that's not how I trade. That being said, MT4's supposed advantage is the ability to use EA's, scripts, and other add-on's. At present, the ability to use an EA is somewhat lost on me; I never intend to use one to actually enter trades, although it would be nice to get more push notifications based on the indicators that I like to use than are available in the web-based Trading Station, which are somewhat limited. Lastly, the web-based TS -- unlike MT4 -- doesn't interface with anything; not with Forex Factory, ZuluTrade, or any of the other websites that analyze your trading data for you, and that save some time if you really want to look at how you're trading from a statistical standpoint. So, at this juncture, I'm leaning toward sticking with Trading Station until I can get Windows-based hardware that won't require the running of an emulator like the Mac does and will probably end up going with the Windows-based Trading Station, which I understand has more features than the web-based, "lite" version. I previously tried loading the TS platform using the emulator I'm using, but had so many problems getting it loaded that I basically gave up.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Amazingly, got the Trading Station platform to install on the Mac using an emulator (Play on Mac) and updated versions of Wine and Gecko. However, can't seem to log in with the login I've got now. I assume it's because the Web-based platform can't talk to the Trading Station platform or MT4. I assume that I will have to open a new account for the Trading Station, move funds over there, yada yada, just as I would have to do if I wanted to go with MT4. Ugh.

Oh, my, what to make of EUR/CAD? When I entered the first leg of my position several days ago, I fully expected Euro weakness to cap the pair at around 1.4242-ish. This, after all, was where a couple of Zigs (peaks) were located and I expected resistance there, with retracement back to the "bottom of the box." But no -- Loonie weakness is currently dominating the pair, driving it upward toward the top of the range that has arguably been in place since early September: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Naturally, this could still be the case, but were I to have taken the time to pull out to the Daily time frame, I would have noticed the channel that the pair has respected since early April and chosen a more appropriate entry toward the top of the channel as a place to enter, currently around 1.434, ultimately targeting the base of the channel (I dunno -- 1.3750-ish): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just goes to show that looking at a pair on multiple time frames can lead to a better entry (rookie mistake). We are, in fact, at about the top of the channel currently. If you want to examine the trade from a risk/reward perspective: entry at 1.43400, take profit 1.38000 (550 + pips); SL at 1.44200 (slightly north of next highest Zig) for 80 pips of risk, so 80 to 550 risk-reward.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
A word of caution about this trade, though ... . We have come upcoming Loonie data in the next few days/weeks that may push the pair out of the channel ... . In looking at the Daily chart, I also notice a potential floor of resistance at 1.3915 which is a low that goes all the way back to November 2013, which is where I'm going to place my target price. I'll move the SL to break even to make it a no-risk proposition at the earliest possible juncture. The Daily ATR for the pair is currently about 100 pips, but I'd probably move the SL earlier than 100 pips into the move.

Ordinarily, my weekly cycle is to open up positions early in the week, and then begin to taper off mid-week. So the first order of business will be to delete those penders in the TE that (1) have not executed and (2) are not intended to add to existing, open positions. The intended goal is to attempt to get as many positions as possible to close net profitable by the end of the week, but I may be be satisfied if the entire "basket," so to speak, of open positions is net positive at the end of the week, at which time I'll consider closing them all out. Having done that, the only remaining penders are intended to add to existing positions that have not yet reached their target, and this should now be reflected in the TE.

Oh, snap, Euro positions took a hit today in the demo ... .

But, actually, after I read the news, is more like the Greenback took a hit ... .

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Well, over in the FXCM forum, I learned that the Trade Explorer (I assume demo or otherwise) -- for all practical purposes -- will be worthless. Apparently FXCM doesn't store data for more than a month, so you won't get any long term historical data and won't be able to have your data analyzed over a several month period. That blows. So, in the end I'll probably just delete it since a four week period isn't squat in the scheme of things ... . Ugh.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Well, all this goofing around with MT4, the demo Trade Explorer, the Windows emulator on my Mac has been a tremendous distraction ... . Time to get back to what matters most -- actually trading. With that in mind: I've been fiddling with ZigZags for a good period of time now, and I like certain aspects of them. I also like certain aspects of the pivot points. At this juncture, I am gravitating toward using pivot points as the main go-to tool because of the cleanliness of the entry -- the .764 and the .236 are right there ... . Those are your entries and exits. The ZigZag indicator is not always that clean, and I had trouble narrowing in on a time frame that would work best for my impatient trading style where I want things to be occurring on a daily basis ... because that is what, in part, makes it "fun". So, I am back to (1) picking direction using the 200 MA on the 1 and 6H charts; and (2) fashioning my entries and exits using the Daily Fib Retracement pivot points. From that perspective, I probably would have avoided a EUR/USD trade today. This is because price in relation to the 1H and 6H were inconsistent at the end of yesterday's New York close; the 6H says the pair is still headed down, but on the 1H, price was above the 200 period MA. That to me says stay out until the pair can figure out which end is up. That being said, I am long-term bearish on the pair, so I've set up a 10-pip wide grid below to catch any retracement the pair makes since I think that long-term fundamentals support EUR/USD moving lower and beyond the monthly low of 1.25000.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Point in fact, the only two trades I would have probably entered today would have been GBP/USD short and EUR/JPY short, which are both consistent on the 1H and 6H time frames, although there might be an argument to be made for having shorted USD/JPY. It has just broken the 6H and broke the 1H on 10/6. I had anticipated sitting out most of the week while I attempted to figure out what platform I was going to use going forward and (now) whether I was going to stick with this particular broker (FXCM). I naturally didn't want to be in positions if I was going to pack up and move out to another broker, so I haven't been doing jack diddly this week and, at this point, might as well take the rest of the week off ... . See you at the beginning of next week ... .

--- 帖子 #394 ---
A goofy week for me, most of which was spent sidelined screwing around with trying to get various platforms to work on my Mac. Here's my month to date, though, which still looks okay: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That dip in the middle of the week is the result of a screwed up EUR/USD position that I did not double check and that (unfortunately executed), closing out a EUR/USD short prematurely (always check, then double check your entry orders ... ).

--- 帖子 #395 ---
On the demo side of things (the former post is for my live), I basically closed the week at break even as compared to the start. The demo is ZigZag indicator-based (4H chart), so it is a lot slower going than I'm used to. In fact, I'm kind of surprised any of the targets were hit for that this week, given their ambitiousness. For example, the EUR/CAD target is some 250+ pips away, which seems like quite a bit when I'm used to settling for way under a hundred pips. Those targets, however, I've tweaked from time to time, moving them to closer ZigZags as price has moved away from the initial entry. Naturally, we'll see how next week goes. Can't wait until FXCM gets its poop together so that I link my live Trading Station account to a Trade Explorer.

Price in Relation to 200 MA on 1H/6H Charts AUD/USD Below (But at Or Near)/Below EUR/JPY Above/Below EUR/USD Above/Below GBP/USD Above/Below NZD/USD Above/Below USD/JPY Below (But at Or Near)/Above ... And so you can kind of see a theme here: short-term Greenback weakness (as evidenced by movement past the 200 period MA on the 1H) set against a backdrop of Greenback strength (as shown by the 6H's). This may provide opportunities going forward if the pairs turn over and resume the longer-term trend of Greenback strength, but it's too early in the week to tell what theme will predominate this week. Last week it was U.S. equity market uncertainty, along with speculation regarding the timing of any Fed interest rate hike. That being said, I remain committed to selling EUR/USD on bounces, and there is a bounce here of which I'll take advantage by fashioning an entry order to short at the .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point should price strike that level prior to the New York close (i.e., good for day). There also may be a Yen theme of sorts developing with temporary Yen strength last week (as a compliment to Greenback weakness) fading as the markets settle. Again, too early to tell. For my part, I'm going to have to look at other pairs for 1H/6H consistency in order to commit to positions. Unfortunately, scrolling through the pairs in which I usually dabble, the predominant theme is that markets, for lack of a better word, are unsettled with pairs deviating from longer-term propositions in the short term. In my mind, best to wait for markets to settle for a few more days before diving in. If we are going to be experiencing more of last week's volatility, then I pretty much want to stand aside .... . So much for my live account ... . As far as my demo account is concerned, I am going to continue to fashion entry orders at the next highest Zig (in the case of short positions) and at the next lowest Zag (in the case of long positions), adjusting Target Prices where desirable to exit the positions in net profit.

Mmmm. Doesn't look like the demo is syncing up with my MT4 (doesn't show new orders). Hope that'll be resolved at some point ... .

If you've read this thread at all, you'll know that I'm kind of a fan of grids. Late last week (primarily out of boredom), I searched through the MQL4 community looking for EA's that would set up grids for me, and I kind of stumbled across one that does a fairly good job of it: Attached File(s) 204060_program_V0_02.mq4 39 KB | 278 downloads Naturally, I wouldn't recommend just setting it and letting it go. Rather, I would look for good places in trending pairs and then start it running at that juncture. Unfortunately, I am subject to FIFO, so the way this particular EA is set up may not work well with accounts subject to FIFO. In that regard, it probably could use a module that takes profit when the net position is in the green. Additionally, the EA is set up for a 20 pip grid and 50 pip TP. While this kind of grid may work for some pairs (like EUR/USD, which is what I backtested it on), you may want to examine ATR to determine what a reasonable grid size would be for a particular pair ... .

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Lastly, the goal for the demo is 6% per month. I previously mentioned that the first trade was an oversized test trade that resulted in a $1502 profit. To be absolutely fair about it, that trade should be excluded from the goal and so the dollar and cents goal will be $50,000 x 1.06 + $1502 or $54,502 for this particular month ... .

EUR/TRY is kind of my new carry trade darling ... . The pair remains rangebound between approximately 2.92 and 2.86, with possible sell areas around 2.918 and 2.901: Attached Image (click to enlarge) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1413772907 Currently, price is approaching the .50 Fib for the range between the 9/7 low and the 10/15 high, so the .50 level may bear watching ... . Me personally, I'm going to wait for another opportunity to short toward the top of the range, rather than entering here on the notion that the pair is going to continue lower. Such good positive carry on the short side, but it requires some patience and calm. Price frequently moves wildly, warranting small position sizes ... .

Here are my open positions on the live side of things: EUR/CAD Short at 1.42524/TP 1.42424 EUR/GBP Short at .79061/TP .78961 EUR/USD Short at 1.27728/TP 1.27600 w/10 pip grid starting at 1.2760 down to 1.2550 GBP/JPY Long at 173.231/TP 173.331 USD/RUB Short at 39.756/TP 39.656 Notes I held the EUR/CAD short, EUR/GBP short, and GBP/JPY long throughout last week's roller coaster and now basically want to exit those positions, albeit at an extremely narrow profit so that I can move on to other trades I'm more excited about. Additionally, I'm naturally leery about getting into additional pair positions at this point given last month's debacle where I ended up far more overexposed than was comfortable due to my continuing to trade 1 x equity leg positions after the usable margin level exceeded 70% (by quite a bit) and when I was carrying, I think, 2-3 "dogs." In any event, the EUR/GBP and GBP/JPY positions are now quite close to their TP's, after which I can concentrate on EUR/CAD, which is quite a bit off its entry price. The USD/RUB is a long-term carry trade that I'm primarily in for the swap, but also wouldn't mind getting out of that position because it does not appear to be very productive from the mere price side of things. Due to the fact that EUR/GBP and GBP/JPY are in an extremely narrow range today, I'm passing on adding any positions to those. EUR/CAD is above the .764 at this point in time, so I will also be passing on an addition there. I fashioned an entry order to add to the EUR/USD short at the .764, which executed almost immediately and changed the average price for the net position; I consequently changed the target price for the net position to fit into the grid and added grid levels between the TP and the next grid level. I'm standing aside from adding to the USD/RUB short position for the time being. Usable Margin: 80.41%/Usable Maintenance Margin: 60.81% On the demo side, I've made a few minor tweaks to target prices in light of the 4H ZigZag indicator, as well as added some entries where it seemed appropriate ... .

I've placed a grid below the current TP, since my original TP was quite ambitious -- below 1.4100. I had hoped to be out of the GBP/JPY long position last night, but after price broke through the 200 period MA on the 1H, it has wandered around a narrow range (i.e., didn't follow through higher), but you can't have everything. USD/RUB's trajectory has flattened somewhat in the past couple of days around the 41 mark (at least on the bid side), leading me to set up an entry to add to the position at 41.141 which is the highest the bid side made it to last week.

On the demo side of things, which is ZigZag indicator-based entries and exits, the EUR/NZD short hit its target price last night (186+ pips) (a little patience pays off) and the EUR/AUD short positions are nearing their targets as well. Hayseed turned me on to a good ZigZag-based indicator which may assist in picking out entries going forward: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The easiest way to attach this to your MT4 chart is to open the Navigator window, scroll down to the "Indicators", click on where it says "xxx More", find the 3_Level_ZZ_Semafor indicator (you can sort the indicators alphabetically by clicking on the "Name" column) and then drag and drop it on to your chart. The indicator labels ZigZag price extremes by level of extremity (i.e., 1, 2, 3), with the 3 being the most extreme over a given time period.

I'm also nearing the point at which I can arguably compound. As previously noted, I've calculated that you can get to 100% return (well, not quite, but nearly) if you earn 6.0% monthly (hey, I like even numbers; the actual percentage to reach 100% compounding monthly is somewhere between 6.0 and 6.5%) and can compound on a monthly basis: Month 1 $50000 Month 2 $53000 Month 3 $56180 Month 4 $59550.80 Month 5 $63123.85 Month 6 $66911.28 Month 7 $70925.96 Month 8 $75181.52 Month 9 $79692.41 Month 10 $84473.95 Month 11 $89542.39 Month 12 $94914.93 Month 13 $100609.83 The notion was to start with .25 equity legs (50/4=12.5, .12 lots if you round down), with the lot size per leg can be increased when .13 lots x 4 or 52K equity is reached. Naturally, reaching that 6.0%+ on a monthly basis will require quite a bit of consistency ... .

After finishing this post and entering orders on the demo side of things, I'll see if anything looks good. Similarly, my USD/RUB carry trade hit a new high today, so I'm not going to add any positions to that at this time. I'm earning good swap on the short, but that's the only good thing I can say about the trade, since I haven't seen a significant retrace of which I can take advantage in order to exit the position.

Longer-term, the theme looks to be bearish, so I would look to sell on bounces, namely around the monthly high near .8900: Attached Image (click to enlarge) EUR/USD also looks to have taken a break from its downward trajectory. Long-term, I remain bearish on the pair for the foreseeable future against a backdrop of Fed tightening and ECB easing and will look to sell on virtually any significant bounce as indicated by longer-term ZigZag indicator-based price extremes with a short-term target of 1.25000: Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP/USD is a more complicated sort of fellow. Fundamentally, there is Fed tightening and BOE desire to tighten, but insufficient positive data to pull it off convincingly. To add to the complexity of the situation, 1.6000 may represent a temporary higher low, at least on the 4H chart. Long-term, the theme is lower; short-term, the theme is higher (based on the PSAR): Attached Image (click to enlarge) My preference would be to trade other GBP crosses that may provide a more attractive set-up. NZD/USD's plot line, despite the overarching theme present in USD crosses of a brief reprieve from Greenback strength over the past several weeks, is predominantly one of decline. I had thought that the pair had been moving constructively upward in a channel, but it then proceeded to break that. Consequently, it may really be in a period of consolidation between .8000 and about .7720, so I would look to sell the pair on bounces toward the top of the "box" (.8000 or so) with a short term target around .7800: Attached Image (click to enlarge) USD/CAD: the predominant theme here is bullish, but this could ultimately be short-term as oil prices stabilize and concurrently boost Loonie strength, driving the pair lower. Additionally, there is the fact that the pair is at quite long-term highs, leaving me to hesitate thinking about going long here. I would vastly prefer shorting the pair from these levels ... . That being said, the pair is coming up against the arguable Double Top resistance shown on the attached chart, which might make a breakout play worth while: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Were I a breakout play kinda guy (I'm not), I'd fashion a short entry to execute should price break through 1.1180 or so with a stop loss at that 10/15 high of 1.14 (about 200 pips risk) or so and a target of 1.092-ish (about 250 pips reward). Not a great risk-reward set-up, but greater than 1 to 1. USD/JPY, having taken a break from its upward trajectory based on a little bit of Greenback weakness and a little bit of Yen strength, has now returned to an area of resistance around 108.25 and has been dawdling there for the past several 4H candles (many of which are doji in nature) which evidence indecision. Due to Fed tightening and BOJ "easing" (it is so hard to tell with the BOJ's manner of doing business), I remain cautiously long on the pair, but look to buy only on fairly large scale dips at places where the 4H ZigZag indicates: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the Demo Side : Well, I've got a virtual bevvy of penders set up based on the ZigZag indicator to take entries at price extremes, should those opportunities present themselves. Naturally, some of the entries are quite remote possibilities (such as the GBP/NZD short from 2.10, which is some 600 pips away), but I figured I'd set up and leave it there. It may not execute in the foreseeable future, but one never knows ... . I also hate it when I was merely "keeping an eye" on certain pairs, only to take my eyes off them, and then have them strike the price extreme at which I was looking to enter. Better to set the entry up now when it's on my mind than later, when I bound to space it out. I am naturally keeping in mind that this month's target is $54,501 (and that I got somewhat of a late start setting the darn thing up; the first test trade was on 10/9).

So annoying that my live is less productive than my demo (started on 10/9). The demo: Attached Image The live: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3,000 pips plus in the demo; 1800 in live -- quite a diff. But I think that there's a simple explanation for this. The demo, since it doesn't involve live funds, allows for greater patience. For example: so what, after all, that your demo's in a 20% drawdown ... . It's a demo. Acting under duress with live money is a whole different show. If I could just incorporate that lack of anxiety into the live, I'd be golden. Truth be told, I didn't make the exact trades in the live as I did in the demo, but it just goes to show.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
So, ultimately, one of the things I'm going to do in order to get some kind of similar performance in the live as I'm getting in the demo is ( ) to ditch the grids on the EUR/USD and EUR/CAD shorts. I will continue to short these pairs based upon 4H ZigZag indicator values with the TP for the EUR/USD short net position at 1.2520 and the TP for the EUR/CAD net position at 1.40532, setting a fixed stop loss to establish a no-risk proposition for these positions when the opportunity presents itself. This will also clean up my Trading Station orders window ... . Hard to wade through and check 60 penders for a grid set up that is done manually ... .

Long-term -- sell on bounces ... . But retracement to 1.2875-ish certainly not out of the question. Here's another take on the long scenario (which I consider somewhat remote due to fundamentals surrounding Eurozone strength): http://www.efxnews.com/story/26689/e...gher-jp-morgan

--- 帖子 #432 ---
And then there is this view at the other extreme, with a prognostication that EUR/USD will reach 1.15 within three years: http://www.efxnews.com/story/26682/e...orecast-socgen But to contrast the two forecasts, so to speak ... . One is a relatively short-term proposition (the J.P. Morgan), the other, a long-term one. I am in the long-term, sell-on-bounces camp with this pair (although I think it's ridiculous to forecast three years out; they're basically just picking a number out of their butts). So I'm taking relatively miniature positions at price extremes over time, looking for large pip movement on the net position. This, in fact, is one of the few pairs that I'm comfortable doing this with; I otherwise want to be in and out in less than a week if possible. Just not comfortable trading this pair "dynamically," since there is a profound downward trend in place.

Live Penders Here are the penders for the live (based on the 4H ZigZag indicator): Attached Image Attached Image I would note that the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator available in MT4 is a bit nicer to use, since it indicates where the most extreme Zig or Zag is (which makes the decision-making process as to which Zig or Zag to use kind of a no brainer). Here's is an example of the EUR/CAD 4H chart, with the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator: So, assuming that EUR/CAD is in a down trend, you would look to sell at the high 3's with the TP's being the low 3's ... .

I see your point. That is a typical situation in all broker in USA. They also have the FIFO rule that mean first in first out, so if you buy EURUSD you can open another long position but, if you want to close just the second position, you are no allow to do that, the first one has to be closed first, FIFO. That is suck, isn't it? Thanks for answer my question.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I've gotten used to FIFO, but think it's a pain in the ass at times unless you're a trader that just takes a single position, one-time entry, and that's not how I trade. I frequently take multiple positions at various price points and so have to look at whether the net position (all of the entries together) is net profitable ... .

thank you for sharing your experience. i have been looking for reliable fibo pivot indicator for MT4. pls advise if you come across any..

I've been playing with a couple of different things, to be honest. When I was primarily using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points to fashion entries and exits, I would first attempt to determine trend direction using the 200 period SMA (Simple Moving Average) on the 1H and 6H charts. If price was below the 200 period SMA on both charts, I would look to fashion sell entries; if price was above the 200 SMA on both those charts, I would look to fashion buy entries. If price was above on one, but below on the other, I would stay away from trading that pair temporarily. For buys, I would fashion a good for day entry order to buy at the .236 and take profit at the .764 of the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points; for sells, vice versa (sell at the .764 and take profit at the .236). If price didn't hit the TP price by the end of the New York close, I would look at the pair again to see if there was still agreement between the 1H and 6H charts and then add to the position in the direction of the original trade (if there continued to be agreement), adjusting the TP accordingly to ensure that the original position (plus any additions to the position) would result in a profit for the net position. If there was no agreement, I would generally stand aside, wait for agreement, and then add to the position in the direction of the original trade when agreement returned. The problem that I encountered from time to time if I limited myself to the 1H and 6H charts was that I would frequently overlook the fact that a given pair was potentially in a range and that price in relation to the 200 period SMA wasn't necessarily helpful in that instance. Where a pair is ranging, you should be selling at the top of the range and buying at the bottom end, a fact that may conflict with price's relationship to the 200 period SMA in some cases. So more recently, I have not only been looking at intraday time frames for a determination of whether a pair is trending solidly in a given direction, but also have been pulling out to a Daily time frame to make sure that I am not missing a "bigger picture" such as where a long-term range is in place and where I should be standing aside from a trade in order to take full advantage of the range. More recently, though, I have been resorting to the ZigZag indicator for entries. This is due in part to the increased volatility we have been experiencing in the markets where intraday movement can easily exceed the span between the .764 and the .236, potentially cutting short profits and the practical fact that ZigZag points that indicate support/resistance areas that have occurred do not change, as compared to pivot points, which change regularly. For example, if you're using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points, which are calculated based upon the previous day's high and low, those will change every day at the New York close. So, it's kind of a time saver to, for instance, look at your chart with the ZigZag indicator, and then fashion entries for the entire week based upon immediately preceding previous price action. For instance, I am looking to sell bounces in EUR/USD, so I will fashion good until cancelled entry orders to sell the pair in the event that price hits the levels indicated by the "3's" (the most extreme ZigZag) on the attached chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And then, for my take profit, I will look to exit the position when price hits an "opposing" "3" (i.e., sell at 1.27690, TP 1.25000). If I continued to use the Daily Fib Retracement pivot points, I would be forced to hop on and enter orders when the new pivot points form (after the New York close). Naturally, you can go to Weekly Fib Retracement pivot points (which are calculated based upon the previous week's high/low), something I haven't really tried ... . Also, use of Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points (or any other pivot point which looks at the previous day's high/low in its calculation of levels) is going to be a short-term, intraday trading methodology; using the 4H Chart-based ZigZag is going to probably involve several days from entry to TP (at least that's been my experience; naturally, if you try to use the ZigZag indicator intraday, you might be able to get in and out of trades in short order; again, something I haven't tried). Hope this info is helpful to you ... .

That being said, I am hesitant to get in on Yen crosses long this late in the game. I had entry orders set up for that last week (to get in on USD/JPY long on dips); it's just that the pair didn't dip enough for me to get some skin into the game. We need merely recall the BOJ's recent reaction to the quick run up to 110.00 for USD/JPY which led to statements of concern about the quick run-up to that level and subsequent Yen strength as a result, so my feeling is that I will not buy at mere "casual" dip in the pair's price; I'm going to look for a dip shown to have support of significance on a higher time frame (4H+) (e.g., around 108.25, which may take some time to develop). Secondarily, Euro weakness predominates, not only in EUR/USD, but in virtually every other major Euro cross (the possible exception being EUR/JPY), so I will look to short those crosses (EUR/CAD, EUR/AUD, and EUR/NZD) on bounces. Cable crosses are kind of a mixed bag, depending upon what they're crossed with. GBP/JPY appears bullish (duh, Yen weakness again), as does GBP/NZD. Out of all the GBP crosses that continue to appeal to me is GBP/CAD short on bounces or to the top of its arguable range (in place since early September) between 1.82 and 1.79. That being said, I am keeping a close eye on GBP/NZD for the development of a short (I don't think it's necessarily there yet except as an extremely short-term play for example from resistance at 2.06-ish with a TP around 2.04): Attached Image (click to enlarge) (I see the pair kind of reverting to a range enjoyed around the beginning of October with some excursions beyond that in the middle of the month). Additionally, I am eyeing an AUD/NZD short for a potentially large move off the double top or the September 5th high I discussed in postings last week (price is right at the 2014 high right now). Folks have talked about a breakout above the aforementioned high, but it has yet to materialize and short-term RSI may indicate decreased buyer interest in driving the pair higher: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Well, there are three parameters to the ZigZag indicator: Depth (12 as the default on the Trading Station platform); Deviation (Default: 5), and Backstep (Default: 3). The 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator I am using in MT4 uses the exact same parameters ... . Now that I compare and contrast the MT4 and Trading Station ZigZag's, it looks like they're exactly the same, so I don't know what I was gandering at before ... . Lol.

Thanks ... . My positions are looking a bit tattered today though ... . The beginning of the month always seems to be a bit of an odd time ... .

The AUD/NZD is kind of a second attempt to short the pair from the top of its arc and 2014 high. The previous attempt (which I was not particularly excited about), I set a stop at +10 pips, and the position stopped out, so this is kind of a second attempt. CAD weakness (I assume) caused all of my extreme 4H ZigZag entries in GBP/CAD to execute, and the pair is now arguably at the top of its short term range. I'm kind of surprised that my GBP/NZD short is still hanging in there; it appears, however, to be going somewhat sideways, so I've moved the stop to break even. My USD/RUB short carry trade (which added a leg at the top of its current trajectory) continues to accrue good positive swap, but price is not being particularly cooperative if I want to exit the position in short order.

On the Demo Side : I've tweaked a few of the penders, but didn't add anything really. What I did do is delete out the USD/JPY longs for now. I'm frankly more interested in a EUR/JPY short at current levels than a USD/JPY long, but the way I've got the EUR/JPY short penders set up is to take a short at virtually this year's extremes, which naturally may not come to pass. That being said, I think it's probably work keeping an eye on the pair for a short opportunity, but things need to settle a bit post-Abe bombshell ... .

As previously mentioned, my EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD, and (I think GBP/NZD) shorts for which I had set up +10 pip SL's all stopped out at +10 pips or so yesterday, which I was fine with. After all, if the pairs were not going to follow through lower, it was best to get in at a higher price in any event. Well, I got my wish in spades, with three of the ZigZag level sells for EUR/AUD executing, 1 of the GBP/AUD, and 2 GBP/NZD. To offset that, though, the EUR/CAD short net position moved into the green and GBP/CAD moved more toward the average sell price (although still in the red). The EUR/JPY position was basically flat. But the most notable thing that occurred today was USD/RUB's break of 44.00 and its venturing toward 45.00. I had fully expected to be in this trade for a lengthy period of time, but here we are going on week 5 since initiating the short position, and there is very little evidence of a reversal or correction, and it is starting to become kind of a drag, given the amount of intra-trade drawdown associated with this one position alone. Current Usable Margin 80.79%/Usable Maintenance Margin 61.58% On the Demo Side : I am experiencing a similar headwind on the demo side, mostly attributable to movement in the Aussie ... . It is possible that an additional "breeze" will blow against those positions come Australian jobs data time. I looked at most of the penders and decided that little needed to be touched for the time being in light of what the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore was showing.

Naturally, those gains could improve, but I think I will go ahead and lock them in here, and then reset penders.

But just to keep myself entertained, I am going to directional grid EUR/JPY short on my live with weenie lots: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Okay, so my first EUR/JPY short entry in the grid has executed at 142.50. There is now a gap in the grid where that order used to be: Attached Image What I do now is wait until one of the grid levels above or below that gap executes and then I fill the gap back in with another entry at that level (142.500). Additionally, since that order executed, I only have five levels below current price, and I can either just leave those alone or place another level below the lowest price on the grid (if it makes sense in light of where the next S/R is; I have it far below at 139.50, so I'm going to fill in another level below the current grid at 141.00).

--- 帖子 #491 ---
So, between my last post and the current one, four grid levels in addition to the initial entry at 142.50 were struck, leaving me with this pender set-up: Attached Image So there is a new gap (the levels at 142.50, 142.75, and 143.00; I think I filled in one or more of those levels as they executed, so it could be that one level executed a sell twice at that level at different times) which I'll fill in on Sunday after the markets open. The net position, now consisting of five legs, has an average sell value of 142.765 and the current ask price is 142.812. At this juncture, I can consider doing a couple of different things. First of all, I can leave my take profit (TP) where it is (it is somewhat ambitious), fill my grid in above and below current price and watch where the pair goes (my position is that it is at the top of a long-term range, and that it will retreat once the effects of last week's Abe bombshell wear off). Alternatively, I can say to myself that I want some fixed number of pips out of the trade or that I want to bail out of the trade at a fixed number of pips for the net position to lock in profits, reloading the grid if the trade direction still looks promising. In that case, I could, as an example, say that I wanted 10 pips out of the net position and move my TP to 142.765 minus 10 pips or 142.665. (I'm subject to FIFO; folks not subject to FIFO could arguably peel off individual profitable legs as they hit particular profit targets or move into profit). Lastly, you can wait for the net position to move into profit at some point, and then fix a stop loss at BE + 10 pips, and then cease adding grid levels at that juncture. Given the fact that I have used the smallest possible lot size (1k), I am going to stay in the trade for now, adjusting the grid around current price (5-6 levels above and below seems good for this pair; that's a total span of 250-300 pips, and the current weekly ATR is about 240 pips; the current monthly about 475).

Week of 11/9: Pairs of Continued Interest As with last week, the same pairs continue to draw my attention: EUR/CAD, EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD, GBP/AUD, GBP/CAD, AUD/NZD, and EUR/JPY. The predominant theme amongst these pairs is range, whether it be long-term (Daily chart) or shorter term (4H), with the general object being to take short positions toward the top of the range, especially in AUD and NZD crosses, where negative swap can suck on your profits if you go long in these pairs. The CAD pairs can arguably be traded dynamically, taking short positions at the top of the range and long positions at the bottom, although I would exercise caution going long EUR/CAD due to Euro weakness. EUR/CAD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The EUR/CAD range is somewhat sloppy at the top, with excursions of price past 1.4370, but with the bottom a bit cleaner at 1.403. I will continue to short upon price's hitting extreme values as shown by the ZigZag. EUR/AUD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Like with EUR/CAD, EUR/AUD is sloppy around the edges, but I'm going to take shorts positions around the top of the range ... . EUR/NZD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The EUR/NZD chart's a bit cleaner with respect to the floor and ceiling of the range ... . The same tactics will be employed here as with EUR/AUD. GBP/CAD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'll be employing the same tactic here as with EUR/CAD -- short near the top of the range ... . GBP/AUD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Well, by now you should be able to read my mind: short at the top ... . AUD/NZD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm not terribly excited about trading this pair, but it's got a 300 pip plus range between 1.13 and 1.10. In the alternative, I would also consider an entry at 1.13 with a TP at 1.112, where price has experienced previous resistance. EUR/JPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is one of the only Yen crosses I'm currently interested in right now. GBP/JPY tends to be too wild for my tastes; USD/JPY appears overbought, and I don't favor shorting the dollar in this market; and I prefer blowing my devotion to AUD and NZD crosses on non-Yen pairs. But my position here is that the pair is near the top of quite a long-term range, with price having wicked through the 2014 high, and that it is now in overbought territory as shown by the Daily Slow Stochastic. So, short from this level, is my take with lots of air below ... . GBP/NZD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I don't anticipate taking a position in this pair right now, but like to keep an eye on it. This is because I only like to short the pair due to onerous swap, and the pair appears to be making higher lows and higher highs on the 4H in a channel ... . However, I would consider a short from the 2.100 level should that present itself or, alternatively, if it breaks the channel and falls apart thereafter. (You'll notice that the pair is kind of neatly tracking the 4H 200 Period SMA on the low end ... .).

On the Live Side: My first order of business is to fill in the gaps in my EUR/JPY short grid that were created when orders in the grid were executed on Friday, so I've gone ahead and done that, with the following result: Attached Image The net position is 10 pips or so in the money right now, so I could close it out and lock in the profit, but because I anticipate the pair moving lower, I'm going to wait on that. Also, if the initial position ever goes into the green, I can consider closing that leg out, since it wasn't at the greatest price, but it isn't quite there yet. Still got that USD/RUB short position open, which I want to clear before venturing into other pairs ... .

A bit of a snore so far this week ... . On the Live Side: Well, EUR/JPY is basically moving sideways here between 142.75 and 142.25, so I've had some levels hit between those (which I filled back in this morning), but not the downward movement that I was looking for, at least so far. Currently, I've got 10 micro legs in place, with the average net value being 142.674. As previously mentioned, I can do one of two things at this point: (1) start peeling off legs as they become profitable (I'm subject to FIFO, so it's a pain in the ass); or (2) take profit on the net position. Just to show you how ridiculous working with FIFO is, here's the chart which shows all of my entries on it: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You'll see that I've got the "first in" trade labeled with its price -- 142.499 (1k), as well as the "second in" trade labeled with its price -- 142.752 (1k). That "first in" trade, per FIFO, must be closed out first. So, I would have to wait until price was below 142.499 in order to close out just that leg in profit, and would have to do so before closing out any subsequently entered legs. However, I could combine that "first in" trade with the "second in" trade to take profit on just those two legs either on (1) an average sell price basis (just as I would do for the entire net position) or (2) when both are in profit. The average sell price for these two legs is 142.499 + 142.752/2 = 142.626. But looking at the chart, I think it's easily conceivable that price will slosh around a bit and that it will hit 142.399, which would result in a 10 pip profit for the first leg, and a 35.3 pip profit for the second -- not great, but one of my objects is to reduce exposure, and if I can do that profitably, well, then it's all good, so that's what I'm going to do in the instant case: fashion an entry order to buy 2k EUR/JPY when price strikes 142.399.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
On the Demo Side: Around $56,000, the point at which I can bump lot sizes up to .14 per leg (although those profits aren't locked in yet). I will probably wait to bump up to .14 after I close out all the positions as a basket (as I did last week), so I don't have to go in and change all my penders to .14 (lazy). ... And all this is assuming that some disaster doesn't strike ... . I added a couple of entries based upon the 1H ZigZag (not much; kinda quiet as far as movement is concerned) and (tearing a page out of Hayseed's playbook), added a couple of NZD/CHF longs to the mix (basically they're the inverse of EUR/NZD). Current equity: $56,002 This Month's Goal (Percent): 6.0% This Month's Goal (Dollars): $57,805 Distance to Goal (Dollars): $1,803 Next Compounding Increase (In Lots): To .14 lots Next Compounding Increase (Dollar Level): At $56,000

Increasing lot size of buy order to 4k (on the notion that I will pick up a position or two if price strikes a grid level on the way down at 142.50 or bounces up to 142.75). This should take out the first four legs in profit (circled in red): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the Demo Side: So, I've been banging the drum on going long the Ruble for quite a bit now in the USD/RUB thread (positive swap, historic highs, all that jazz), so I thought I'd dive in and fashion an entry order on the demo side.

On the Live Side: Still waiting for that USD/RUB short to clear ... . Snore. But I still have that EUR/JPY short grid in place while I'm waiting. Here's all my penders for that as of right now: Attached Image You'll notice a gap at 142.750, which I'll fill in if price takes out another grid level either higher or lower, but it's still moving pretty much sideways ... . The average sell price for the net position is 142.666, so I'm basically break even for the net position, but will peel off four legs at 142.399 if the opportunity presents itself.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I filled in the gap at 142.750, only to have it execute (what can I say, the pair likes that 142.750 level), bringing the net position average sell price to 142.679 (consisting of 13 microlegs). I will peel off 4 legs via entry order to buy 4 micros at 142.399. ... And then another 4 with an order to buy at 142.150 ... .

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Zowie kapowie! EUR/JPY went higher overnight, which is not necessarily a bad thing, and now the position has 19 legs in it and an average sell price of 142.952. Because the position is reaching the limits of how big I'd like it to be, I'm going to bail out of the entire net position at +10 pips (at 142.852) and then either reload or switch to a 10 pip directional grid below the average sell price.

On the Live Side: Current Open Positions EUR/JPY short at 143.254/TP 143.154 w/10 pip grid below. USD/RUB short at 44.569/TP 44.469. Notes That USD/RUB short is holding up my parade a little bit, but the position made some positive progress today. At this point, I just want to get out of the trade at basically breakeven so that I can devote my time to more quickly productive trades; the pair is a margin eater and probably requires more patience than I really have. Sometimes I just prefer getting problematic trades closed out before moving on, since you see them every time you open your trading platform, and it can be a downer. Nevertheless, it brings a welcome break to things just to have a couple of trades ... . As far as the EUR/JPY grid trade is concerned, I would say that I prefer the x-pip (x being the number of pips for each grid level) grid below if you're going short or above if you're going long and then dealing with any dangling trade by ZigZag indicator inspired additions or any other reasonable method that moves the net position price closer to current price. (I noticed that I had difficulty setting up a grid this way in MT4 as compared to Trading Station, which is kind of a bummer if I want to use this method with MT4 ... ; it is entirely possible that, being an MT4 novice, that I just don't know what the hell I'm doing.) In this way (grid below price for shorts/grid above for longs and exiting each level as price strikes, for example, +10 pips), you don't get caught in a large position consisting of a large number of small legs, but rather just one dangler. Naturally, you won't catch all the movement with such a system and you're arguably repeatedly cutting your profit short, but to me it's more important to limit exposure if price suddenly moves against you than capture all the possible profit you can, for example, by just making a single entry at the top or bottom of the range or in the direction of the trend. Moreover, you lock profit in as you go without the prospect of price never hitting the TP you've set ... . On the Demo Side: I had a bit of fun last night scalping EUR/JPY (due to boredom associated with my live and the fact that not even much was happening with the demo). But these trades represent a good example of a MT4 grid trade (selling at levels above current price, with a set exit for all positions which in this case was based on a ZigZag low): Attached Image (click to enlarge) (You'll note I had a couple of losers in there; I tweaked the TP based upon the 1H ZigZag after the losing entries had executed, not paying attention to the fact that the TP level was above a couple of the entries ... .) Three other trades were in and out in less than 12 hours, which is always nice ... . At this juncture, since I've only got two trades open, I am going to clear all the penders and then reset them with .14 lots given the fact that I've cleared the 56k mark ... .

Not much going on this week ... . The market seems to have been lulled into an eerie calm ... . On the live side, still waiting on my USD/RUB short to resolve itself, as well as my EUR/JPY short which started out as a grid trade, after which price popped up to between 145 and 144, where it has kind of wandered for the past several days ... . You can kind of see the effects of this market lull on the demo side ... . Very few entries, which I think has something to do with Euro crosses generally. Looking at the charts it appears that many Euro pairs on the verge of breaking lower or have broken slightly lower; my entries are based on ranges that were in place up until last week and many of those are now some distance from current price action. One of the exceptions is EUR/GBP, which popped up in response to Cable weakness ... . Off to tweak entries on the demo ... .

I've looked at all of the pairs that I have pending orders currently and, believe it or not, I didn't add orders to any of them ... . Virtually to a one, there is no new "3" level on the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator I use as a template in my MT4 to take advantage of other than the ones I've got currently set. As I indicated earlier in the week, the vast majority of these pairs are in one range or the other, and now (with a couple of exceptions), the vast majority of the pairs are at the bottom of the ranges that have been in place for several days or weeks ... . I don't want to short those from these levels, but will wait until they revert to their previous ranges or show something to indicate that the days for those ranges are over ... . One exception, though, is EUR/GBP, which has popped up substantially due to Cable weakness ... . So with that one, I have "gridded" EUR/GBP (for the lack of something better to do), with my TP for all these entries being slightly north of .7800: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you're of the more patient variety, you may want to wait it out to short at the high "3" around .8040, shown on the 4H here (far left): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It seems to me that all of them have their various merits, but I haven't decided yet which one I like best (I continue to gravitate toward the ZigZag, but it appears to require a degree of patience if, for example, you're using the ZigZag on the 1H; even then, it seems like you need to expect to spend 3-5 days in a trade ... .) A common theme, though, is the taking of multiple, smaller positions at different junctures in a pair's trajectory, rather than a single, one-time entry ... .

Unfortunately, I finally had to bail out of my USD/RUB short for a loss. Great swap going on, but overnight, the broker increased the MMR from 50.00 to 125.00 -- too rich for my blood ... . Oh well, I pretty much knew that that particular trade could have been the best of the year or the worst ... .

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Now that I've shed myself of that USD/RUB short (sheds a tear), back to basics on the live: Current Open Positions EUR/JPY Short at 143.504/TP 142.25 Penders Attached Image Notes The live entries pretty much mimic what's in the demo, with the exception of the EUR/JPY short, which is now a multi-leg, long-term proposition with an ambitious target that is now some 400 pips below current price.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Closed out that EUR/JPY short at a loss and deleted all penders ... . Currently only have a EUR/USD short at 1.25333/TP 1.25233. My plan is to use the live to scalp; the demo to look at longer-term propositions. I think it really helps to have two separate accounts: one for short-term stuff and one-for long-term stuff. That way you can still scalp or intraday trade pairs that you've already taken positions in. This would not be necessary were I not subject to FIFO/anti-hedging rules ... . I'll probably get things set up this way at the beginning of the new year ... . I still consider this first year of trading my "education." I've tweaked the demo a little bit, adding orders here and there ... . Looking slightly battered right now, but now particularly worried (unless for some reason I have problems getting to the six percent by the end of the month).

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Made minor tweaks to the demo ... . To relieve my boredom, I've started a separate thread on Asian session scalping: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...88#post7885188 As I may have mentioned previously, I started trading forex about a year ago and regard this year as "educational." One of the last things I wanted to do before going whole hog into trading forex at the beginning of next year (been mostly trading with an account of &lt;$5,000 in risk capital), I figured I'd try some scalping to round out my "forex degree." Having positions in a bunch of pairs in the live account may interfere with pairs that I want to scalp in the short term (in and out during the first hours of the Sydney/Tokyo sessions), so I'm going to do the long-term stuff in the demo and devote the live to scalping.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Locking in my profit on the demo ... . Will check to see if I actually made the 6% goal for this money already after today's close. Naturally, it's only a demo ... .

--- 帖子 #523 ---
On the Demo Side: Current equity: $57,914 This Month's Goal (Percent): 6.0% This Month's Goal (Dollars): $57805 Distance to Goal (Dollars): +109 Next Compounding Increase (In Lots): To .15 lots Next Compounding Increase (Dollar Level): At $60,000 Notes So I've made my 6% goal for this month (November) about a week ahead of schedule. I don't think that's particularly significant in a way, since there will no doubt be months where you are "behind schedule"; the demo's only been running for a couple of months, which isn't statistically significant in the grand scheme of things, since the notion is that I am shooting for wealth building over a fairly large window of time (1 to 5 years). The one thing I like about setting up several different pairs in which positions are running is that I treat the entire balance of open positions as a basket. There are good ideas in the basket; there are crappy ideas in the basket. Naturally, the hope is that the good ideas outbalance the bad ones and that the basket, as a whole, will be profitable at some point in time. By setting up a basket, my feeling is that I get to avoid the bad psychology associated with single trade success/failure which can lead to bad trading decisions on a trade by trade basis such as the feeling that you have to "make up lost ground" to a bad trade by going in bigger on the next trade or some other bad approach that can easily lead to disaster (been there, done that). Naturally, I know that some traders are able to deal with a single trade loss on an unemotional basis, tell themselves that it was just a bad idea and move on to another pair or for a better entry in the same pair at a different point in the pair's trajectory, but this is probably one of the toughest adaptations for traders to make. Setting up your ideas as a basket can help you work around this problematic aspect of losing from time to time. Additionally, if I compare and contrast scalping, day trading, position trading, etc., this is the approach that works best for me in terms of devotion of time to the task of setting up trades and monitoring them. This is because I am in the U.S., still have a day job, and can only do screen time during the Sydney and Tokyo sessions (these are frequently like watching paint dry for me). I feel that certain types of trading like scalping and intraday trading (which I think require virtually continuous monitoring of trades while open) are best done in the busier London and New York sessions when I am either asleep or at work. Don't get me wrong; I think scalping and day trading are perfectly fine ways to go about being profitable in these markets, it's just that they require a greater devotion of time. So, enough of my philosophy ... . Next month's (December's) goal: Current equity: $57,914 This Month's Goal (Percent): 6.0% This Month's Goal (Dollars): $61,389 Distance to Goal (Dollars): $3,475 Next Compounding Increase (In Lots): To .15 lots Next Compounding Increase (Dollar Level): At $60,000 If you go through the trade report and look at all the trades, you'll see a common, large theme with the trades, which I intend to continue with in the coming weeks as long as these larger themes hold: Euro weakness, Dollar strength, Yen weakness, Cable weakness (at least short-term). Consequently one of the emphases will continue to be on Euro crosses that are either trending downward or are rangebound (EUR/NZD short, EUR/AUD short, EUR/CAD short, EUR/USD short), with entries being taken on bounces. I was in Cable crosses for a period of time, but then GBP dipped substantially, and I have avoided GBP crosses for the past week or so as GBP digests lackluster economic data which will likely motivate the BOE to push rate hikes further down the road. I had looked for Cable crosses to experience somewhat of a substantial bounce (which did not occur), so my entry orders using the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator never executed, since they were at price extremes of the previous ranges that various Cable crosses held for a period of time. The Yen has experienced substantial weakness over the past week. Various Yen crosses have been screaming out "bull" for a good period of time, but many of these pairs have been in substantial overbought territory for a period of time, making me wary of wading in long. Both EUR/JPY and USD/JPY experienced some retracement late in the week (I caught a bit of EUR/JPY's in my live ... ), but it remains to be seen whether there will be continuation of this correction this week or whether Yen weakness will continue. Personally, I think that the weakness is way overdone, but "way overdone weakness" is not an actionable trading idea. My notion with Yen crosses such as EUR/JPY and USD/JPY is to trade them intraday if possible, looking for breakouts or retracements from the daily or weekly open/closes or other obvious S/R. There is quite a bit of economic data going on this week, coupled with a U.S. bank holiday on Thursday (Thanksgiving). Liquidity is likely to be diminished on both the holiday and on Friday, which will make next week's return to full trading on Monday (which also happens to be the first of the month) more volatile than usual, as there is likely to be profit taking on Wednesday (instead of Friday), since, for all practical purposes, this will be the last day of the trading for the month of November ... . I considered just sidelining myself for the rest of the month since I don't like these periods, but my general assessment is that these periods can present good entry opportunities as pairs move briefly move contratrend due to profit-taking and so-called "squaring up."

Did notice one thing on the demo stats. I guess because it is a demo account, some data is being deleted as we go. Consequently, while the overall balance will show accurately, the YTD gains will not, which is kind of a bummer, since I will not be able to look at long-term performance, but only a couple of months' worth. Oh, well.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Well, I did expect one thing out of this week and that is that it would be "funky." End of the month, end of the week, U.S. holiday. As I recall, this month started in a similar funky fashion, with pairs trading all over the place toward the end of October, and then returning to some semblance of normalcy in the following days, at which time I was able to lock in some profits in pairs whose movement toward the end of October was puzzling and, yes, a little bit disconcerting. Naturally, I don't imagine that the beginning of every new month is exactly the same in this respect (there are so many factors present in the market), but I'm hoping that the beginning of December and the beginning of the new week shines a little bit brighter than this week did. Unfortunately, I got home too late to look at whether anything hit TP in the live today ( FXCM 's server is down for the weekend); a few did in the demo, with the GBP/USD short being the highlight: Attached Image Both of the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore-indicated entries/exits for GBP/USD worked out quite fantastically ... .

Tweaked entries and exits on my demo (which mimics my live) based on the 3-Level Zig-Zag Semaphore.

A Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point play in EUR/GBP for 41.8 pips:

--- 帖子 #534 ---
So, for the remainder of the month of December, I am going to largely be doing trades in my live using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points and the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator in my demo. Unfortunately, there isn't a comparable indicator to the 3-Level ZZ Semaphore in Trading Station and cutting and pasting trades from the demo into my live is either burdensome or I'm just plain lazy or I want to see how one stacks up against the other. I already know, for example, that the 3-Level ZZ Semaphore requires a greater deal of patience for trades to reach your TP; with the Pivot Points, you're in and out of trades within 3-5 days in most instances. Unfortunately, I still have some ZZ-based trades in my live that I will have to dispose of using the Pivot Points. In addition to the EUR/GBP short PP-based trade, I was also able to get some pippage on GBP/NZD and EUR/NZD short PP-based trades and was able to exit a EUR/CAD short ZZ-based trade for a small profit on the net position; the GBP/JPY trades were scalps that I worked on last night: Attached Image (click to enlarge) To avoid your having to scroll through the entire thread to find the basic gist of using the Daily Pivot Point Fib Retracement Pivot Points, here are the fundamentals: 1. Look for consistency in terms of price's relationship to the 200 period SMA on the 1H and 6H charts. If price is below the 200 period SMA on both charts, look to go short by fashioning a Good for Day entry order to sell the pair at the .764 with your TP being the .236. If price is above, look to go long by fashioning a Good for Day entry order to buy the pair at the .236 with your TP being the .764. 2. If the order executes, but price does not hit your TP the first day, look to add to the position if and only if price's relationship to the 200 period SMA on both the 1H and 6H are consistent. Otherwise, wait until they are consistent to add. Move the TP to +10 pips or the new appropriate Fib Pivot Point (whichever will result in greater profit). 3. This system does not use SL's generally, although I periodically place an SL if the position is in profit in order to make the position into a no-risk proposition. Current Open Positions EUR/AUD Short at 1.45878/TP 1.45778 (ZZ-Based Trade) (Price is above both the 1H and 6H 200 Period SMA; no positions will be added until price is below both SMA's) EUR/JPY Short at 146.350/TP 146.250 (ZZ-Based Trade) (Price is above both the 1H and 6H 200 Period SMA; no positions will be added until price is below both SMA's) EUR/USD Short at 1.24566/TP 1.20000 (ZZ-Based Trade) (Price is at the 1H 200 Period SMA; below the 6H 200 Period SMA; the .764 is right at where a "leg" was added shortly before the New York close, so I will pass on adding to this today; I regard this as a long-term position, so I won't necessarily bail out of it unless the position becomes too hefty in terms of exposure) GBP/AUD Short at 1.83567/TP 1.83467 (ZZ-Based Trade) (Price is above both the 1H and 6H 200 Period SMA; no positions will be added until price is below both SMA's) GBP/CAD Short at 1.78034/TP 1.77934 (ZZ-Based Trade) (Price is above the 1H, but below the 6H 200 Period SMA; no positions will be added until price is below both SMA's; moreover, price is quite close to TP). GBP/CHF Short at 1.51608/TP 1.51000 (PP-Based Trade) (Price is above on the 1H, but below on the 6H Period SMA; no positions will be added until price is below both; TP, however, is moved up to today's .236 at 1.51097) GBP/USD Short at 1.57093/TP 1.56442 (PP-Based Trade) (Price is above on the 1H, but below on the 6H Period SMA; no positions will be added until price is below both; TP, however, is moved to today's .236 at 1.56278) New Positions GBP/NZD short at 2.00240/TP 1.99472 (I am somewhat equivocal about this one; price is right at or slightly above the 1H 200 Period SMA ... .) EUR/NZD short at 1.59458/TP 1.58422 AUD/NZD short at 1.08353/1.07889 Notes I considered Yen crosses other than my EUR/JPY short, but USD/JPY is quite close to 119.00 in the scheme of things, has been in overbought territory for several days, and may be due for a correction lower. The same can be said for GBP/JPY, which is currently testing 186, which has provided some resistance previously. Additionally, you may have noticed that I am settling for getting out of my ZigZag-based positions for 10 pips on the net positions. I would prefer doing that so that I can deploy Pivot Point-based entries on those pairs, which are of shorter duration and require less patience, quite frankly.

I will add to it using the Pivot Points as a guideline as long as the entry is below the net position's average sell price (the old "add to winners" saying). I am basically targeting the 6/2010 low here, although there is a higher low at 1.2075-ish in July 2012, which I will naturally keep an eye on.

Current Open Positions AUD/NZD Short at 1.08356/TP 1.07889 (.764 &amp; .236 virtually unchanged; no changes or additions) EUR/AUD Short at 1.45878/TP 1.45778 (price still above 1H/6H 200 Period SMA's; no changes or additions) EUR/JPY Short at 146.350/TP 146.250 (price still above 1H/6H 200 Period SMA's; no changes or additions) EUR/USD Short at 1.24566/TP 1.20000/SL 1.24446 (current price above yesterday's .236, but below today's; SL moved to today's .236) GBP/AUD Short at 1.83567/TP 1.83467 (price still above 1H/6H 200 Period SMA's; no changes or additions) GBP/CHF Short at 1.51608/TP 1.51508 (price above 1H/below 6H 200 Period SMA; no additions, but TP moved to +10 pips) GBP/NZD Short at 2.00240/TP 2.00140 (price above 1H/below 6H 200 Period SMA; no additions, but TP moved to +10 pips) GBP/USD Short at 1.57093/TP 1.56442 (current price above yesterday's .236, but below today's; SL moved to today's .236) New Good for Day Entry Orders AUD/USD Short at .85167/TP .84593 EUR/CAD Short at 1.41518/TP 1.41200 EUR/NZD Short at 1.59010/TP 1.58352 EUR/USD Short at 1.24534/TP 1.24000 GBP/CAD Short at 1.78392/TP 1.78045 GBP/JPY Long at 186.256/TP 186.730 GBP/USD Short at 1.57166/TP 1.56585 NZD/USD Short at .78659/TP .78103 USD/CAD Long at 1.13441/TP 1.13996 USD/JPY Long at 118.479/TP 119.041 Notes I have kind of added some hedge positions here (against my AUD and NZD cross shorts) with the AU and NU shorts, as well as a couple of Yen cross longs to hedge my EUR/JPY short; I don't ordinarily bother to do this and may naturally regret it since I've been describing certain Yen crosses as "overbought for days" and amenable to substantial correction. The EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD shorts are somewhat discretionary, as they do not fit into the "below/above both 1H/6H 200 Period SMA's" rule. If you drill out to the 6H time frames for these pairs, you'll pretty much see that they are rangey. Ideally, you would just place an entry to sell at the high and (possibly), an entry to buy at the low of the range (I prefer to short these pairs; the 6H 200 Period SMA slopes somewhat gradually downward), but I'm looking to catch somewhat short-term movement ... . With EU and GU, we had some good price movement today which I intend to lock in should a retracement occur. Consequently, with both of these pairs, I've set the SL's at today's .236, fully expecting a bounce of some sort and for the currently open positions to be closed. If that occurs, I've got good for day penders for these pairs to capture any significant bounce. Otherwise, I naturally hope they move lower ... .

Having added legs to my EUR/AUD short (previous month's high), GBP/AUD (previous month's high) (due to Aussie downturn in light of lackluster GDP data) (I don't ordinarily do that, but sometimes you have to strike while the iron is hot), my boat is looking pretty full, with my usable margin down to 86% or so. While I do have two "no-risk" propositions out there right now (EU short and GU short with SL's in the money), I want to make sure that I don't get too exposed, and so I'm deleting the remainder of my penders (with a couple of exceptions) to allow room to make additions to my "problem children" if necessary going forward. The two penders I'll leave hanging are my EUR/USD and GBP/USD shorts (which would only execute if my current positions stop out in the money).

I think this has more to do with Euro weakness than Yen strength, since USD/JPY and GBP/JPY continue to burn higher. EUR/USD: I expected to wake up this morning and find this trade stopped out. At this point, I'm going to exercise some patience (which I don't usually have) to let it run a bit. With the stop placed below both of the legs I entered using Pivot Points, I will attempt to add to the position after the New York close, assuming that the .764 is below my stop. GBP/AUD: Some Aussie retracement of its downward movement during yesterday's Asian session has helped this position out, but it is not there yet ... . GBP/CHF and GBP/NZD Shorts: Okay ... . Okay ... . Okay ... . Why? Well, sometimes you enter crappy trades. These fall into that category.

As I expected I would have to do earlier in the year, I will need to wind down my Trading Station only FXCM account before opening an MT4 account (which, ironically), I will then be able to access from Trading Station. I assume that Trading Station can interpret MT4 data, but that MT4 cannot interpret Trading Station data. (Ain't that the crappers!) In any event, I probably won't be posting much here (at least regarding my live trades) until that is done, since all I'll be doing is closing out existing positions once they move into profit, yada, yada. Naturally, I'll continue goofing around with the demo, trying a few last minute things before heading into 2015 which, (oh my God!), is right around the corner. Kinda kicking myself for not doing this when I had everything closed last week or the week before. Would have been a lot easier. Oh, well ... . Trade safely!

--- 帖子 #548 ---
That being said, I am looking forward to what the ECB does tomorrow, as I am currently EUR/USD short at 1.24566 with my SL set at 1.23801. I have about 65 pips of wiggle room between current price and the SL, but would naturally like to see the pair move lower. The current target price is 1.21000 (although I am doubtful we'll get there tomorrow), even assuming that everything goes my way: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Unfortunately, I'll be asleep or at work when the fireworks occur ... . I hope to wake up tomorrow and see my position still there. (Fingers crossed).

... and the demo continues to be somewhat brutalized by AUD, NZD, and JPY weakness ... . The fortunate thing, these are .25 x equity legs for each of these positions. If I would have gone larger with each of the legs (say, for example 1 x equity (which would be like 56k per leg)), I'd be a good 14% down ... . As far as the Yen trades are concerned, I am gambling (pure and simple) on a correction. There is absolutely no evidence that the bullish trends for USD/JPY and GBP/JPY are yet at an end. EUR/JPY is slightly different in my mind; Euro weakness is beckoning that pair lower or, in the alternative, the pair is somewhat rangebound as compared to UJ and GJ. The preferable thing to have done with these pairs would have been to wait for a break of the 1H or 4H SMA or obvious support before going short. Just thought I'd let you know ... . Moreover, the method being utilized, which is basically a "mean reversion" method, seeks to buy or sell at price extremes (repeatedly, if necessary, and as indicated by the ZigZag indicator in this case) and then wait for price to revert to a mean or average which will ideally mean that your multi-leg position will move into profit for the net position. Naturally, this requires some patience; as you can see in the open positions section of the demo, many of the positions are quite far away currently from their target prices. From time to time, I tweak these targets if it is becoming apparent that the target price in relation to current price does not appear to be attainable. This results in some legs being "in the red," but the intended result is that the net position be profitable, rather than a single entry. To me, it is simply easier to identify larger/longer-term trends or themes and to take several, small entries consistent with that trend rather than take a single entry and hope for the best. Additionally, I think it is harder to be wrong if you use several entries (not all of which, of course, are always profitable) than it is if you just rely upon a single one. The last thing I need to constantly remind myself of is that this is just one day or one week in which the portfolio is down; the goal is consistency over the long term, and one day or even a couple of days or even a week is not long-term.

Unfortunately, I again got home too late to look at how my live's sitting (not nearly the exposure to the Yen as the demo). Clearly, though, going contra-trend with the Yen crosses ... Eh ... not such a good idea. I'll naturally see how those positions are doing come the Monday open, but my guess is that I'll have to devise something to exit the Yen cross positions gracefully, and it is likely to be a reverse Martingale set-up which I will use to pick those positions off one at a time (or at least reduce the Yen strengthening gamble down to, for example, one pair). Hey, it's a demo; it is for experimentation, and the word "Martingale" generally implies that the account will eventually be blown up, so I am not sure that I would necessarily use this method on a live unless the position I am trying to dispose of is quite small, which mine generally are ... . However, a reverse Martingale to me is better than a blind forward Martingale where you buy or sell at set levels, increasing the lot size at those levels, which are really quite arbitrary ... . With a reverse set-up, you know where price has been and potentially can discern where it might go short-term, so that you don't need to take a loss on the net position (ideally), which is really what the game is all about -- some winners, some losers, but, in the long run, net positive. That being said, I bet that there are plenty of little reverse Martingale horror stories, the likes of which are: "I went in for 15 x equity with a TP only 15 pips away, and my order executed, but price bounced up a hundred pips and never hit my TP; now I am in a world of hurt." My guess, however, is that these stories are likely to be smaller in number just because every Martingale system I've seen is "blind" and looks to take profit moving forward into the future before price has moved ... . So, just because you have the benefit of looking back at where price has been in setting up a reverse Martingale doesn't mean that it is any less fraught with risk than a forward. In fact, it is entirely possible that a reverse is more risky ... . This is because a forward Martingale starts out extremely small and can, by design, have capped doubling at a particular exposure level. A reverse looks at where price is now and then assesses BE at that juncture, and a BE proposition could be (at the point at which you're making the attempt), be very dicey and increase your exposure quite substantially all in one fell swoop. Well, enough of the relative merits of the system ... . The basic reverse Martingale requires you to first calculate the current average price of your net position. With my GBP/JPY entries, I have 14k at 188.18, 14k at 186.92, and 14k at 186.00. The average price of the position is 187.033, consisting of a total of 42k (or, in decimal terms -- .42 standard lots). Secondly, you will want to choose the price at which to add your reverse Martingale position. There are naturally the usual considerations about where to add the position, such as nearby S/R, historical highs and lows and that sort of thing, but let us assume for the moment that I want to add the position at 189.20. Thirdly, I need to ask myself at what price point I want the entire position (original entries + reverse Martingale position) to attain break even, so that I can determine what the size of the reverse Martingale position should be. In this case, let us assume that I want to enter the reverse Martingale at 189.20 (just below current price) and that I want break even to be 10 pips below my reverse Martingale entry. What will the size of the reverse Martingale position need to be in that case? A calculation is required: my current position is .42 at 187.033 for a total of 78.55386 so the calculation is (78.5536+(x)(189.20))/(x+.42)=189.10, where x is the number of lots required to be sold at 189.20 in order to achieve break even at 189.10. Solving for x, the number of lots you will need is equal to (Desired Break Even Price)(Size of Current Position) - (Current Position Average Price)(Size of Current Position) Divided by The Difference Between the Entry Price and the Desired Break Even Price In this particular example, the result is 8.68 lots at 189.20 to achieve BE at 189.10. If I wanted BE to be 5 pips below my reverse Martingale entry, I would need to sell 17.79 lots; 15 pips below -- 5.65 lots. Purely as an experiment, then, I will fashion an entry order to sell 8.68 lots of GBP/JPY at 189.20 with a TP at 189.05. Naturally, I will have to change the TP's of all the outstanding positions so that when price hits 189.05, the entire batch will sell at that point, and my GBP/JPY positions -- as a whole -- with be net positive.

Hey Zebrasquirl, first thank you very much for your tread. Very well written (even if English is not my first language, I appreciate it a lot. It is easier to follow, thank you), and provokes everyone to take a step back and think. Personally it is one tread that I follow on FF, even if I do not post :o) From your last post above about “saving”your long Yen, it kind of makes me “shiver”, if I can say so. I completely see your point, but I feel (and I am most probably wrong ;o) that doing it the other way might bring better odds in your favour. Do exactly the same approach, but put your “big saver order” going with the trend. With what happened on the last day of October from the BOJ, people are more incline to short the Yen than to long it the way you would do it with your “saver”. Thus it seems a lot safer, and logic, to short the Yen with your “saver”. So why not close your losing trades (it is hard, but really it does completely make sense to just stop the bleeding) that are long Yen, and place your saver short Yen, using whatever entry approach you normally use and are experienced with? It would make a LOT more sense to me. Moreover, by doing so, going with what could be a reasonably long trend, why going to 10 pips only? I completely understand that you want some reasonably quick results (so not going for the 500 pips trade just yet...) to clean your sheet, and feel “good” about it, but why not reducing the order by 2 and going to 20 pips? or by 3 and going to 30 pips? Etc... you see what I mean. 30 pips going with the train is quickly done if right, and the position size would be a 1/3 of what you would use going for that 10 pips counter trend, just in case something goes really wrong. With that 10 pips counter trend idea, with such a leverage, I feel it can jeopardize your whole account (" blow your fingers off " as your signature says) and your confidence really quick, whereas you are actually doing really well so far. OK I stop here I speak far too much ;o) It is just some thoughts from a total noob, because I know nothing about forex or trading actually. So do not trust what I say, and no worries at all if you feel it is bullsh*t (it probably is anyway!!! ;o), I won't be offended at all. Have a great day, Cheers, J-F

You are exactly correct. There are three things I can do with these Yen cross trades in the demo: (1) just close them out, take the loss, and look for a better short entry; (2) exercise some patience and wait for the anticipated correction (the first week of the month, after all, tends to be somewhat unsettled); or (3) do something high-risk and somewhat stupid by attempting to exit the positions net positive by, in essence, loading up on the position at this level, even though it may continue higher. Because I am attempting to test a method (a mean reversion method that intentionally does not use stop losses), and I wanted to keep statistical track of whether I could get a 6% ROI on such a system with minimal heartbreak, I've decided to just let these positions ride for the time being; doing a reverse Martingale will screw up my stats, even if it is successful, and I'd prefer not doing that at this point. But the fact is is that the short entries (long Yen) were against the trend and were based on the mere fact that these pairs were in overbought territory and were due for a correction (which is not really enough to enter a trade on). Also, I would note that a smarter thing to have done if I wanted to take a counter-trend trade in the Yen based upon merely my "gut" feeling that the Yen would eventually strengthen, would have been to limit my Yen exposure to just one pair. Tripling up on three crosses only magnifies the problem if the "gut" feeling does not pan out, which exactly what happened here. But this is why demos are good to use for a period of time trying different things, especially if you try to treat your demo somewhat seriously and learn from the lessons your demo trades teach you.

Live Results -- First Week of December The first week of December went well after a losing month (due to a "gamble" on USD/RUB short that I bailed out of at quite a loss; I knew that it could have been the best trade of the year; it turned out to be the worst): Attached Image (click to enlarge) I do have some scalps with larger than usual lot sizes sprinkled in there, some of which panned out, some of which did not. The scalps I have been doing use the "fingertrap" method, extremely tight fixed stop losses, and scaling in and out, but turn out to be very time-consuming for a guy with a day job who is largely relegated to the Asian session (which can be like watching paint try for a scalper who is looking for follow-through movement), so I am likely to do little of that going forward (gotta get your sleep some time, and three to four hours a night just doesn't hack it).

Live Account Current Open Positions EUR/AUD Short at 1.46983/TP 1.46000 EUR/GBP Short at .79228/TP .784000 EUR/JPY Short at 147.424/TP 147.224 GBP/AUD Short at 1.84508/TP 1.84408 GBP/NZD Short at 2.00921/TP 2.00721 Notes Every so often, I like to tweak my method, see how the "tweaking" works out and then incorporate it into my trading methodology if it works out. Previously, I was largely entering and exiting at the .764 and .236 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points, but I am modifying that slightly to fashion entry orders to enter/exit on the Daily 1 and 0 pivots, but also on the Weekly and Monthly 1 and 0's. There is often some retracement from Weekly and Monthly 1 levels, as well as bounces from Weekly and Monthly 0 levels that I want to take advantage of; these levels also represent price extremes for given periods of time. The Good for Day Penders will have to be redone on a daily basis after the New York close; the ones based on the Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Points once a week at the beginning of the new week's session; and the ones based on the Monthly's once a month at the beginning of the new month's trading ... . I am also kind of reverting to just trading EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/CAD, EUR/AUD, and EUR/NZD (and possibly GBP/CAD). While EUR/USD is in a prolonged down trend, the other weak/weak pairs (I don't really know how else to describe them) have characteristics that make them ideal for a mean reversion methodology, which is why I imagine why traders like Hayseed like to use them so much (Alirajaie likes to scalp GBP/CAD from the bottom and top of short-term ranges, best as I can tell). Without going into too much chart analysis, you can pick one or more of these pairs out and see the rangeyness that I want to take advantage of with them (with the exception of EUR/USD, which I just intend to short on bounces).

--- 帖子 #557 ---
There is also one other option (kind of): exiting the position at a loss, but at the best possible "loss" price. And by the best "loss" price, I am speaking of the nearest swing low (for a short) or the nearest swing high (in the case of a long) ... . It's less of a loss than a standard stop, which usually does not represent the best "loss" price ... .

Demo Account With the demo, I am using the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore ... . The entries/exits are at the points where generally the 1H "3" Semaphore indicates. In this example, I've made several short entries over time, with the original TP at the "3" level to which the Yellow arrow is pointing. Unfortunately, the position has not gone my way, so I will be revising the position to TP at the "3" indicated by the red arrow: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I guess this is what I am talking about when I say that I am taking a loss at the best loss price that price action indicates ... .

--- 帖子 #559 ---
In comparison to the GBP/JPY example above, the USD/JPY has not yet given me a revised exit point, so (at least for the time being), I'm keeping my TP (indicated by the red arrow) in the same place in spite of the fact that the position has moved against me: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Naturally should the indicator provide me with a new "3" exit point, I will revise my TP to that level ... . (Point in fact, though, I expect it to "paint" a new low "3" level soon ... .)

Live Penders So, here are the live penders ... . You'll notice that some are "Good for Day" and that some are "Good 'Til Cancelled". The Day orders are based on the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points; the GTC ones based on weekly and monthly's: Attached Image I would note that some of the entries are virtually the same for the Daily, Weekly, and Monthly because some of these pairs reached weekly and/or monthly highs last week. Naturally, if these entries are particularly close, I only take one entry ... . Also, if I just had an entry at or about the same price as what current pivot points would indicate, I don't bother setting up another entry for the time being (EUR/JPY, for example, is literally at daily, weekly, monthly highs, and I just had an entry late on Friday around these levels, so I didn't fashion any entry orders for that pair).

Ewwwww .... . The demo is looking somewhat brutalized at the moment ... , as is the live ... . Live Current Open Positions EUR/AUD short at 1.47751/TP 1.47551 EUR/CAD short at 1.41402/TP 1.40404 EUR/JPY short at 147.424/TP 147.224 EUR/NZD short at 1.60217/TP 1.60117 GBP/AUD short at 1.85944/TP 1.85744 GBP/CAD short at 1.79419/TP 1.78000 GBP/NZD short at 2.02254/TP 2.02054 Penders EUR/USD short at 1.23211/TP 1.2000 (Good for Day) EUR/JPY short at 149.413/TP 147.224 (Good for Day) Notes Shortly after the New York close, I added legs to the EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD, GBP/AUD, and GBP/NZD shorts, since they were at or nearly at daily highs. I would naturally like to exit these positions (preferably at a small profit), and devote my leverage to more worthier causes (or, in the alternative, catch these pairs at better entry points than I did, particularly the EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD shorts). I am perfectly fine with settling for 10 or 20 pips in many cases where my strategy has proven unproductive; this may seem like an awful lot of effort for 10 or 20 pips, but it adds up over time ... . In light of these additions, my usable leverage is kind of at the maximum of what I consider ideal (10 x equity or less; it is right at 10 x equity right now), so I naturally want to limit the number of additional positions that can open up while I attempt to close the currently open positions I've got, so am limiting good for day penders to EUR/JPY (which has fallen quite a bit off last week's high) and my old standby -- EUR/USD, which I want to get back in after having my rarely asserted SL hit last week after Draghi's talk ... . I feel sort of stupid setting my SL in so tight, getting stopped out, and then having price move in my direction after the post-Draghi spike ... . All that being said, experiencing days like the past few can be discouraging, regardless of the method you're using. All of sudden, you're in a bad streak, and you begin to question what you're doing, whether you should continue doing things that way, or whether you should make drastic modifications to what you're doing. Don't panic, is what I tell myself. If necessary, shut down your platform for a few hours, step away, do something else. It will be there when you return. Think about what's occurring with your trades, but don't be so hasty to change the way you've been doing things merely on the basis of a couple of days of poor performance, especially if what you've been doing in the long run has been profitable. By the same token, be prepared to question whether what you are doing is fundamentally sound, especially if it has not been working over lengthy stretches of time. Additionally, review your trading plan (you should have one) and ask yourself whether you are adhering to the rules you have established, especially when it comes to risk management. Good risk management will allow you to weather fairly significant trading mistakes ... (which is kind of what I am doing now -- "weathering trading mistakes").

... But it's interesting how quickly the tables can turn on you, even if you're being fairly conservative.

But if the last few days are any indication, things can turn as quickly in your favor just as quickly as they turn against you ... .

But to keep things in perspective, only the closed trades really count; the open positions could go nowhere or, of course, go quickly south. If my math is correct on the demo side, the trades closed today represent about 875 pips in gain: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #577 ---
On the demo side, the closed represent 108 pips or so: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The primary reason for the difference between the demo and the live is the demo is more conservative in the sense that I didn't do something as foolish as tripling up in Yen cross shorts ... . Naturally that paid off in the demo, but it is not something I want to generally do as a matter of course. If you're going to take a position as questionable as shorting a Yen cross on the notion that a correction is overdue (which is basically where I was going with those Yen cross shorts), then you should probably limit it to a single cross. If shit hits the fan and the position moves against you, you're not tripled up and can potentially hedge against your bad decision by going short Yen in one of the other crosses (for example).

--- 帖子 #578 ---
On the demo side of things, I have moved up the TP's to BE + 20 pips for the net positions represented by EUR/NZD, EUR/AUD, GBP/NZD, and GBP/AUD. (You can have an EA calculate the average value of your net position in MT4; use a spreadsheet; or do it manually; Trading Station does it for you, so it's a bit handier that way.) Some of the positions are getting quite long in the tooth in terms of the number of entries taken, so the TP's will now be somewhere other than at a "3" of the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator. Naturally, I could exercise patience and see if price moves in my direction all the way to the next "3" level, but it is sometimes better to take less, reduce your exposure, and then move on to attempting slightly better entries ... . The past few days have been quite volatile, so if I can get out of these positions for +20 pips on the net positions plus the swap, I'll consider myself both lucky and happy. The EUR/CAD, GBP/CAD, and EUR/GBP positions I'm leaving alone for now, as I've just initiated entries on those ... .

Tweaked a few things on the demo side. Looks like we're experiencing some USD weakness (supposedly on the back of a "risk off" environment generated by concerns over Greece), which may provide good entries on bounces, for example, in EUR/USD and GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
That very same USD weakness, however, is not assisting me with exiting my EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD positions in either the live or the demo. This is because the bounce being experienced by AUD is being replicated (perhaps to a greater degree) in EUR and GBP. I will need EUR's and GBP's assistance to the downside in order to exit those positions ... .

One problem I noticed on the demo side with the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator is that it does repaint. Consequently, if you already made an initial entry in a trade, you may end up chasing the most recent "3" level up or down the ladder (depending which direction you're trading) with your entries, and this is the cause of so many entries in EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD. Consequently, I'll have to modify the way I make entries after my initial entries and not make an entry on the last "3" Semaphore until a new swing high or low is established, at which time I assume the immediately preceding "3" is set in stone ... . Tweaking the current demo entries in light of that fact now ... . (Another reason to do a demo on an indicator that may have little idiosyncrasies like this that require accommodation in the way you trade ... .)

--- 帖子 #585 ---
On the live side, I just use a plain old ZigZag indicator, so I don't necessarily suffer from the same problems as with the MT4 "bells and whistles" indicator. However, it is entirely possible to chase price with various set levels using just the plain old ZigZag if you're not careful, which has ironically led me to be in the same boat in the live as I am in the demo with EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD (albeit with far fewer entries). I think the thing to do is pause for a little bit on those pairs, watch how they are moving in relation to the 200 SMA (up, for now) and wait until they break beneath the 200 SMA on various time frames before considering additions. The fact, however, is that by the time price breaks the 200 SMA (for example, on the 1H), the TP will be hit which is, naturally, fine ... . Off to look at potential scalps in Yen crosses ... .

Barring some titanic market movement between now and Friday's close, this is likely to be this week's results for me in my live: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Bumpy in places, but it'll do ... . That being said, still have open positions to dispose of with EUR/CAD, GBP/CAD, EUR/AUD, and GBP/AUD -- as in the demo, all short, and all in the red ... . As previously noted, I need to examine the manner in which I add positions after the initial entry. I think I have gotten in too mechanical a mindset with the additions and should evaluate open positions each day before deciding whether to add at a particular point. Consequently, in the live, I've deleted out all of the open orders for the time being, so that I can look at the entries with a fresh perspective come next week's open. Happy trading and have a good weekend!!!

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Well, this week has been a roller coaster. First it looked particularly disastrous and then I was able to bail out of my Yen cross positions, at which time I felt better about what was left -- EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD, EUR/CAD, and GBP/CAD shorts. Well, not so fast ... . I am literally back in the crapper. Oil prices, thought to have stabilized around $70/bbl., dropped even further. Equities markets tanked a bit. Risk-off seeped into the market on the back of concerns about Greece (remember Greece?), giving the Yen a brief bout of strength and the Greenback a bit of weakness. Everything, it seemed was upside down. So, given where the portfolio was at -- the crapper, I think it was wise to step back, not get into any new positions, and then look at the situation with fresh eyes starting next week. Now, some may say "Why don't you just use stop losses and/or just bail out of these horrible trades, and move on?" And that is a very good question. For the demo, my answer is that it is test, in essence, of a mean reversion method (which has been touted as an effective way of trading; I am in that camp, although I am beginning to doubt that in markets as tumultuous as this), and I think that stop losses could get in the way of that by stopping positions out at price extremes when the theory is to stay in the position until such time as price reverts to a mean and presumably to profit. The key to such a method is obviously the decision-making process behind when to add to a losing position (a contrarian view, I know) and something I confess I have not fully figured out. Obviously, it has not proven to be a good thing to just mechanically add positions without evaluating the direction in which price is moving at that particular time. I have said this to myself a million times, but I can't seem to follow my own advice and that is: don't add unless price in relation to the 200 SMA on the 1 and 6H time frames (you can use others, I'm sure) is divergent and/or is no longer in the direction of your original entry. Wait to add until price in relation to the 200 SMA is convergent and price in relation to the 200 SMA is in the direction of your original entry. Also, a chart with the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore attached to it may present several possible entries above current price. Fashion only one entry order, for example, for the "3" immediately above the price, with the TP being the "3" immediately below the price. And then wait ... . If the order executes, but price does not hit the TP, consider adding additional positions as long as the set-up is still good. As tempting and easy as it is, I now recognize that is probably a mistake to set up three or four entry orders above current price where 3's exist; depending on the market environment, price can drill through those levels in quick succession, leaving you with a larger position than you would like and catch you in a trend that was not anticipated and that goes against your position. Obviously it is much easier to address problems associated with one leg than with four legs that executed one after the other in quick succession ... .

While I'm waiting for my various trades to resolve themselves, I usually go out and do a little surfing to see how other folks are doing things. I came across this guy, who has a similar trading style in terms of entries and additions: Inserted Video It's worth watching the whole video, but in essence here is his entry/exit system: 1. Chart set-up: Renko/Heikin Ashi, 20 Period EMA, Either CCI or MACD. 2. Entry/Leg Sizes: 1/5th of what you do were you making a single entry. 3. If HeikinAshi is green, price is above 20 Period EMA, enter long with confirmation from the CCI or MACD; vice versa if HeikinAshi is red. 4. Add to position if original set-up is still valid with similar leg sizes. 5. Exit upon change in Heikin-Ashi trend direction. It is unclear, however, as to whether he sets a price target upon initial entry or just lets it run until a particular time frame's Heikin-Ashi changes color. Similarly, it is unclear as to whether the initial entry is "at market" (which I virtually never do) or is at a particular price within the Heikin-Ashi candle or at some other price point. He mentions making entries across multiple time frames for a given pair (5 min., 30 min., 60 min., 240 min., 1D). Naturally, if you're trading manually, juggling trades across multiple time frames could be unwieldy; I prefer just sticking with one time frame for entries and exits for simplicity's sake, although I can see some advantage to entries across multiple time frames so as to catch a particular move at its beginning or to catch dips and bounces within a larger time-frame's trajectory. He also uses to hedging to basically wash out adverse movement during the course of a trade, something that is easier if you're not subject to FIFO, although I imagine that if you're subject to FIFO, you could set up two accounts (one for the primary move; the second to hedge any adverse movement). But the most interesting part of his method is his "Zone Recovery" trading methodology, which is a hedging strategy. Again, however, if you're subject to FIFO, you would have to set up two accounts, one for the primary move, and then one to hedge that move in the event that your assessment of trend direction turns out to be incorrect. The example given in the video for this strategy is for a EUR/USD 1 lot long entry at price x with a TP of x+150 pips. If you've properly predicted the trend and price moves up to x+150, you book your profit. If price does not strike x+150, but instead moves lower, you fashion an entry order to short the pair with 1.4 lots at x-50 with a TP for the short of x-200. If the pair moves lower and strikes x-200, the net trade (the long position is at x-200; the short position is x+150) will net 10 pips. If price does not strike x-200 at that point, but instead moves higher, you fashion an entry to buy the pair again with 1 lot at your original buy entry at x, so you are now 2.0 lots long, 1.4 lots short. Unfortunately, however, to make the sequence work mathematically to net pips upon a strike of either the upper or lower TP requires you to increase lot sizes over time: Attachment Attachment ... and I could contemplate a situation where price wobbles back and forth over the Zone Recovery area for substantial periods of time (for example, during a price consolidation period) and the exposure to that one trade could easily become 10 x equity. So part of the mathematical trick is to choose TP's that are achievable within a fairly short number of iterations of the sequence (for example, based on Daily ATR) and a so-called Recovery Zone that doesn't result in a huge multiple of entries within the sequence such that the net position overwhelms the account. Point in fact, though, I don't know how given brokers treat hedged positions in a single account from a margin standpoint; at one point, they were deemed "flat" with no margin required. http://forexmagnates.com/fxcm-makes-...ged-positions/ But I do know that if you are subject to FIFO and want to hedge, you will have to set up two accounts, and you are going to be subject to margin requirements on your primary trade account and margin requirements on your hedging account, which would be a major drawback to such a system. Also, the additional drawback relates to account size. This is because in order to get the correct multiple for the hedged position (in the above example, a EUR/USD long), a 1K intial entry would not work. Doing the math, the short, hedged entry would have to be a 1.2k lots and brokers who only allow trading in multiples of 1K will not allow an entry of that sort. The minimum entry initial entry in the above example would have to be a 5K lot, with the first hedged short position 7K lots (1.4 x 5K) and things would get funkier as you go through the sequence and the math requires you to round up in order for the net position to become profitable with these kind of lot sizes ... . Obviously, being able to trade in standard lots would relieve you of this problem, but not everyone (me included) has accounts of such a size as to permit that. The alternative would be to go with a broker that permits trading in "units." (Don't quote me on this, I think Oanda allows trading in units of currency, rather than in 1K lots ... .) So, it could be a great system for folks: (1) not subject to FIFO; (2) with brokers who treat hedged positions as "flat"; and (3) account sizes that will accommodate the math required for the lot sizes in the sequence without rounding up and/or a broker that permits trading in "units" as opposed to set lot sizes that are multiples of 1K.

Live/Demo Well, looks like I've got some waiting to do. Although there are differences between the live and the demo, they are basically the same in the sense that they are both short EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD, EUR/CAD, and GBP/CAD and are both in the red for each of those net positions. Looking at the charts for all of these pairs, it makes little sense to add positions at this juncture; they don't appear to yet to be poised to give up their recent moves' upward. History has shown that it makes little sense to continue to add positions until such time as a pair appears to be topping or bottoming or reversing its recent trend, in spite of the fact that those additions might move the net positions' prices in your favor in the long run. (Point in fact, once it became apparent after the second addition or so that these pairs weren't going anywhere but up, I should have paused and waited, but hey, all part of the educational process ... .). That being said, does my current exposure in the live or the demo permit dabbling in other pairs? Probably not, given the current level of exposure versus my total exposure rule-of-thumb (10 x equity max). The usable margin in the live is 85.0% or so, and we're at 10 to 1 in the demo. I could wade into another pair in the live, but have to keep in mind that I may have to add positions to the current open positions there going forward; the demo is basically maxed out, especially when I have to keep in mind that I will in all likelihood need to add positions there to get out of the positions net positive ... . I know it's just a demo, but in order for it to be a true test, I have to attempt to adhere to my rules and not do anything funky (like my reverse Martingaling idea, outlined above). Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes you just have to wait if you've gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle. It's part of managing your bad trades. Additionally, these positions might get a boost out of upcoming economic data (who knows, though; been a weird past few days; they could tank further), and it might be worth waiting until after that data comes out to see where things stand at that point ... .

--- 帖子 #590 ---
The one thing I'm going to do in the demo, though, is move all the TP's to BE +10 pips ... . This has already been done in the live (although to +20).

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Alrightee ... . Doing a little bit of a different thing with the demo to dollar cost average ... . A couple of things: First of all, I know that I should not add a position unless the original conditions that prompted the initial entry remain true (i.e., that, for a short, price is below the relevant MA). If conditions change such that the direction is no longer valid in light of price's current relationship to the relevant moving average, then you should not make an addition, but rather wait until the conditions that prompted the initial entry are true ... . But, here we are; I've added too many positions with a couple of pairs. Generally speaking, I only want to have 4-6 legs in any position max before being able to bail out of the net position in a positive manner. There are a couple of things I can do here: (1) I can treat the entire net position as a single entry at the average price for all the positions and add legs of equal size to the entirety of the current position as though I had made a single entry at the average price; or (2) treat the entries to date as 2, 3, etc. legs by dividing the current size of the position into 2, 3, etc. positions as though I had taken fewer positions, but at larger sizes. The former would involve additions, in certain cases, larger than I would like to expose, so I have opted to take, for example, the entire GBP/CAD position, which consisted of 5 equal legs of .14 lots (for a total of .70 lots) and treat it as though I had made only 4 entries of .175 (rounded up to .18 lots) per entry. I have done a similar thing with the EUR/CAD position, although I probably did not need to do that, since it only consisted of two entries to date. Although this smacks somewhat of a Martingale, it is the only mathematical way in which to make the additions effective because, as you add legs, the impact of a given addition diminishes. Naturally, were I not to have gronked up the additions in the first instance, I would probably rarely be placed in a position of increasing the size of an addition in order for that particular addition to remain of use in bringing the target price closer to current price ... . Edit: I'm adding positions in the demo to look at how this might work, but I won't be doing that in the live. Prices still above relevant MA's, and I'm short in all these positions, so not a good place to add (still).

--- 帖子 #592 ---
With the live, I am probably going to be attempting to pick off one position at a time in order to avoid overexposing myself (which sounds dirty). The live is somewhat different, since there are fewer legs involved: EUR/AUD short at 1.48313, consisting of 4 legs (8 k total) EUR/CAD short at 1.42408, consisting of 3 legs (6 k total) GBP/AUD short at 1.86622, consisting of 6 legs (12 k total) GBP/CAD short at 1.80491, consisting of 3 legs (6 k total) So, with GBP/CAD (for example), I could treat the average sell price as just one leg of 6K at 1.80491 and make subsequent additions of 6K. Alternatively, I could treat it as though I had made two 3k entries at 1.80491, and make subsequent additions of 3k to dollar cost average. Or, I could just continue doing what I'm doing and add 2k legs until I have a total of 10k legs (5 legs at 2k each) and then reevaluate the position at that point. In contrast, I've got too many legs with GBP/AUD ... . The next leg would be the 7th leg. So, by way of example, I could again treat that trade as a single 12k entry at 1.86622 and make subsequent 12k entries; two entries at 1.86622 of 6k; three entries at 1.86622 of 4k; or four entries at of 3k at 1.86622. At this point, adding anything to any of these positions is academic. Prices are still above the relevant moving averages across multiple time frames, and there is no point in adding positions until these pairs break lower or, at the very least, fall into a range at current price levels. But, when I do add, I am likely to do the following: EUR/AUD short additions that are 4k in size (i.e., treat the current position as two legs) EUR/CAD short additions that are 3k in size (again, treat the current position as two legs) GBP/AUD short additions that are 6k in side (treating the current position as though two legs were entered), and GBP/CAD short additions that are 3k in size (treating the current position as though I only entered twice). Naturally, this is less than ideal; it smacks somewhat of Martingaling, which usually ends in a dramatic implosion. What you want to do is be patient (unlike me) and wait for the trend to revert to the direction of your original trade before making additions. This might be a couple of days, a week, or a month, but you wait. This is the only way a dollar cost averaging methodology will work ... .

From an AUD bloodbath to a CAD bloodbath ... . Demo Side I am not sure I did my additions to the shorts entirely correctly from a mathematical standpoint (in particular, GBP/CAD, which I recalculated and found out that my additional, oversized position should be .35 lots, so I had to add another piece separately). That being said, I have checked the Daily ATR's for these pairs, and it looks like I am relatively close to something like 2 x the Daily Average True Range for the Target Prices. Nevertheless, absolutely horrid intratrade drawdown from my perspective. (My sole defense is that this is attributable to something like "funky market syndrome," which appears to have been in place for a couple of weeks here ... .) Live Side I am basically letting the positions in the live ride for now until prices move to the short side of the SMA. I've already goofed up the additions with GBP/AUD (too many, as it was with the demo). But the two pairs I am considering adding to the mix are EUR/NZD short and EUR/GBP short, if only because the movement is largely sideways, somewhat rangey, and centered around a fairly flat 200 period SMA. I look at both of these pairs as more suited to longer-term set-up's that may take several days to develop given the breadth of the ranges, so I won't be using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points for the entries, but rather range floors/celings for entries and exits. Given EUR/GBP's longer-term range profile, I may fashion a GTC entry order to sell at around .8015-.8030, with a TP around .7850. With EUR/NZD, I may fashion a GTC entry order to sell at around 1.6240, with a TP around 1.5910. There is a lot of wickiness at both the floor and ceiling of this range, unfortunately ... . While I am waiting for EUR/CAD, GBP/CAD, EUR/AUD, and GBP/AUD to become more favorable for additions, I will probably be scalping most of the time, which is what I've been earning pips with this week so far: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm a rookie scalper, so some of the entries have been rather inept, but have yet to turn off the platform with my head held between my hands in sadness and dismay ... .

Demo Side Post FOMC, EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD shorts very near their respective TP's, but the EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD positions still have some work to do. Naturally if there are ZigZag "3" semaphores above current price, I may add short positions should price strike those levels. Live Side It is basically the same story on the live side, with prices very near TP with the EUR/CAD and the GBP/CAD positions, but somewhat distant from the EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD positions. On the 1H, both EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD appear to have broken the 34 EMA (I've been using the 8 and 34 EMA's to scalp; might as well use them here ... ), but have yet to do so on the higher time frames. That being said, I think I will now start adding positions here, and will fashion good for day entry orders to short both EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD should they hit their respective Daily Fib Retracement .764 Pivot Points (which are now some distance overhead).

Live I've got two positions left: EUR/AUD short at 1.48313 (consisting of 4 legs) GBP/AUD short at 1.86622 (consisting of 6 legs) Additions to Current Positions Currently, price has just broken the 1H 200 SMA for EUR/AUD, but nothing doing for GBP/AUD, which remains above that line. As previously noted, I am going to treat the EUR/AUD position (which is 8k total), as though I only entered two legs for that position (this is somewhat arbitrary at this point; frankly I never considered rules for adding when you've, for example, already entered 5 times (5 legs), but have yet to reach your target price). While I could enter one more 2k leg (for a total of 5 2k legs), I am more interested in motivating an exit from the position, rather than being patient (which, as I have noted, has burned me in the past). Additionally, the closing of the EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD shorts has freed up some margin, and I am now back at a comfortable margin level, so I don't have a particular problem adding here (Current Usable Margin: 91.02%). 8 divided by 2 is 4, so I am going to treat the position as though I only entered 2 4k legs and make my additions of 4k size and fashion a good for day entry to short EUR/AUD should price strike the current .764 at 1.51467. I will revise the TP in the event that that order fills to +20 pips for the net position. With GBP/AUD, I am going to continue to wait out of concern that not only Cable may strengthen, but also that AUD may weaken further, thus causing the pair to move higher from where it currently sits. New Positions The following pairs appear to be either range-bound or convergent in terms of prices' relationship to the 200 Period SMA on the 1H and 6H charts (i.e., they are both on one side of the line for both time periods): EUR/USD (convergent short) EUR/GBP (rangebound between .800 and .784) EUR/CAD (reverting to rangebound between 1.433 and 1.404) EUR/NZD (rangebound between 1.62 and 1.577, albeit with a tendency to slop over the ceiling and floor) USD/JPY (convergent long) (although I would exercise some caution here going long; price has just cleared the 1H 200 Period SMA) GBP/USD (convergent short or rangebound between 1.56 and 1.575) For my part, I am going to fashion good for day entry orders to short EUR/USD, EUR/NZD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/GBP should price strike their respective .764's, with the TP being the .236's.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Demo With the demo, I am not completely following my trading plan. If the past few weeks have shown anything, it is that I do not have a plan for when the plan I've got reaches five legs and the TP is not struck. Do you continue adding? Do you change lot sizes? How do you treat the net position at that juncture? I think that treating the net position as though a smaller number of legs has been entered for the net position is fine, but what number of legs should you treat the net position as? Clearly, I think treating it as a single leg might be inadvisable; the additions get too large. Looked at another way, should I reduce my lot sizes for the legs from 1/4 of 1 times equity to something smaller like 1/5th, so that when I do reach the fifth leg, I am only at 1 x equity for the net position? Since this element of the trading plan requires tweaking, I figured I would just treat the net positions as though a certain number of legs were added, divide the net size of the position by the number of legs, and then add that new lot size for additional legs in an attempt to close out the position net positive. For instance (and I know I've gone through this math before), if the net size of your position is .70 lots and you've entered 5 times and decide to now treat the .70 as though it represents only two legs, your 3rd, 4th, and 5th additions under this new series should each be .35 lots (.70 divided by 2 legs equals .35). Naturally, all this dividing of the net positions by a set number in order to continue adding with the goal of exiting the net position profitably would possibly not have been necessary were I to have followed the trading plan of not adding unless price was convergent on the 1H and a higher time frame (e.g., 4H) in the direction of the original trade and had realized that the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore repaints. Looking at the GBP/AUD chart, for example, I would basically only have made the first entry and then waited, and waited, and waited for a higher 3-Level ZigZag "3" Semaphore to Paint and then waited for a lower "3" to paint before fashioning an entry order to enter in the direction of the original trade at the higher "3". Instead, I chased the repainting "3" all the way up the ladder ... . This naturally did not occur in the live, since there is no semaphore, but just Zigs (peaks) suggestive of where an entry should be made, although I did do a little bit of chasing there as well, but not as much in the live with the 3-Level ZZ, which is why I am out of both my EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD positions in the live, but not in the demo. All that being said, I find that the matter of being patient and waiting for price to be convergent in the direction of your original trade is harder said than done. For example, the GBP/AUD position looks to be deep underwater at the moment. You start to panic and tell yourself you just want out of the position net positive, and you really don't care if it's just for 5 pips at that point. You are tempted to fashion an entry at the swing high, even though there are no indications that price is breaking lower and, in fact, may break higher, merely for the purpose of moving price for the net position closer to current price. It is enormously difficult, I have found, to resist the urge to enter and steel yourself to the fact that an intratrade drawdown, sometimes larger than you would like, is occurring, and to convince yourself that if you just wait, you will get a sounder entry. Basically, however, I'm looking to hone in on a set of rules that I can apply somewhat mechanically, not only for the initial entries, but for the additions of legs, such that the system is profitable while at the same time reasonable from an exposure standpoint. While I think the system is sound as long as you're able to exit net profitable within five legs, I think my treatment of additions after the fifth leg has been added but the TP has not been reached has been sloppy and less than systematic. From that perspective, I think it's worthwhile to ask myself that if I were going to design an EA to do what I do manually, what set of rules would I give it for the entries, additions, and TP? If I don't know what rules I would give it for additions and for situations in which the max number of additions is reached, well, that's an aspect of the EA that I need to work on ... .

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Let me give you some ideas. I look at your trade explorer and found that you make a lot of SELL orders in bullish trend, but why? You need look for tools that help you detect real trend (not indicator). About zigzag repaints, it should do that. To use zigzag you need split your graph using zigzag and then statistically calculate probability of each legs movement in pips, with this information you'll have a more chances to place order at right time.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
You're absolutely correct in terms of misreading trends. I generally do not use an indicator, but rather moving averages to assist in picking trend direction. Not sure why I missed trend direction, for example, with GBP/AUD. With respect to ZigZag, I have heard mention of using it the way you suggest, but was unable to find a variation of ZigZag that measured, for example, average length of the Zig or Zag or a particular period of time. Right now, I think it's best use (at least for me) is for pairs confined to a range.

Demo The demo added a single position today, another GBP/AUD leg short. I will adjust the TP once the markets open on Sunday and will probably delete any pending orders in pairs other than those for which a position is currently open. There aren't that many days left in the month, and I'd naturally like to see what the month-end stats are for the use of the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore, and would like to have the current open positions close for that. I always find that if I want to get my spirits up, switching to the "Balance" stats does that, which show locked in gains (unfortunately, data more than a certain number of days old gets deleted from FXCM demo's): Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is naturally the kind of balance curve I like to see -- smooth and up ... .

Out of all the stats for the demo, though, this is the one I like least -- intratrade drawdown: Attached Image That occurred during this odd-ball, topsy-turvy month, and is no doubt the result of a couple of my trend mis-reads and improperly made additions to the initial entry ... . Nevertheless, way too big (even if it does all work out in the end ... ). This kind of motivates me to think that each leg should be 1/5th (rather than 1/4th) 1 times equity. Smaller legs means smaller exposure, bigger room to make mistakes, and smaller intra-trade drawdown for a dollar cost averaging strategy.

Basically on and off today, the goal being just to really check the EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD, and GBP/CAD positions that are currently open to see whether additions are advisable there. Looking at the charts, it seems that the answer is "no." A couple of these have broken the 1H 200 SMA, but are way above the 4H (demo) or 6H (live) 200 SMA ... , so I'm going to leave those alone for now. EUR/AUD and GBP/CAD's TP's, after all, are within their respective Daily ATR's, so they might hit without doing a darn thing ... . GBP/AUD is somewhat farther out, so will require more patience. But just for good measure, I've thrown in a few penders just to push me toward that 6% goal (hopefully).

With EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD, this led to the positions' becoming overly large. Looking back on those particular trades, I think my original thought upon first entry was that these pairs were in a range; unfortunately, they broke out of the range and continued higher, against my original entry. I am basically fine if that happens, but I continued to chase price up the ladder mechanically, which was counterproductive. So, I am tweaking my set-up in order to prevent or otherwise minimize additions in that kind of situation. Originally, my basic chart set-up was the 200 SMA and Daily Fib Retracement Points, and I don't think anything is going to change there. I used the pivot point values to enter and exit, since they did not change throughout the trading day, and this is ideal for a person who, like me, has limited time to hop on the platform, figure out trend direction, formulate entries, and get the heck off. At most, I'm looking at having a couple hours at the end of the New York trading session to do this. In looking for an "ideal" trading methodology, one of my considerations was how much time I wanted to devote to trading every day, and it frankly isn't all that much. I don't want to be staring at a screen for lengthy periods of time looking for a set-up; I'd vastly prefer just hopping on a prevailing trend or into an established range, setting up entries and exits and be done with it. At any rate, as an alternative to entries using the pivot points themselves, I think I am going to use the 200 SMA value for my entry values. Naturally, there are a couple of drawbacks to doing this, especially on the lower time frames. The 200 Period SMA value changes over time as additional candles are added, which affect the average price, so you will have to tweak the entries over time as price moves, since the SMA value will change. However, in the event you've made an initial entry short, going forward, you're only going to want to take additions where price is at or below the 200 SMA; if it is not, you stand aside and wait until price is at or below (or at or above in the case of a long) ... . (It is odd how that 200 SMA was on my charts all along (in black and double-width), but that I continued to add in the direction of the original entry even though my rule was that "if price is not on the side of the 200 SMA that is consistent, stand aside and wait"; tweaking my rules will make me take notice of that line ... .) In this set-up, the Pivot Points will continue to act as good guidelines for exits. I am hoping that this will help avoid my making additions that are against a trend that has developed after my entry or where I've totally misread the initial trend ... .

The Biggest Mistakes (and Best Changes to My Trading) I Made This Year As you might know from reading this thread, I regard 2014 as my educational year in forex. I fully expected to make a number of mistakes along the way, and they proved to be exactly the kind of mistakes that everyone says you should not make. But having someone tell you that you shouldn't do this or that versus actually doing what they advised you not to do are two different things; your mom can tell you not to stick that fork in the toaster while it's plugged in, but actually doing it and then getting mightily shocked ... , well, you're even less likely to do that again ... . So, here they are, my biggest mistakes and best changes I made to my trading in 2014: Biggest Mistakes 1. Calling a Bottom or Top . Don't do it. Let the market do it for you. Naturally, you'll miss part of the move, but it's far better to do that than get caught on the short end of that stick. As if once wasn't enough, I called tops in a couple of different pairs twice in 2014 (once in GBP/USD, once in USD/RUB). Both resulted in big ass losses (although eventually GBP/USD did retreat substantially; were I to have stuck that trade out, I would have eventually profited, but panic set in). 2. Not Realizing that the Trend is Your Friend/Doubting Whether the Trend Is Going to Continue to Be Friendly. It is until it isn't. All trends end at some point, but follow it until it ends and then get out. If you have any doubts as to whether a trend might be ending, however, you shouldn't be entering that trade. Unusual consolidation, historical price highs/lows, etc. all lead to potential doubt. 3. Goofing Around With Discounted "Systems". At several junctures throughout the year, I have piddled around with various systems or methodologies that have been universally poo-pahed by experienced traders. Using directional grids is just one of these systems that I tried out. Sometimes they worked (for example, when I was trading in the direction of a solid trend), but sometimes they proved somewhat disastrous, with the disastrous aspects of them outweighing their benefits, at least if my balance sheet is being truthful with me. 4. Dabbling in Emerging Market Currencies When There Are Plenty of Lower Risk Alternatives Available. Don't get me wrong; emerging market currencies can be profitable in the right conditions. There were, after all, several junctures throughout the year that I was able to gain some pips from EUR/TRY, for example. Unfortunately, however, I got seriously burned on USD/RUB short. Trading EM currencies requires a different mindset, at least from my perspective, and isn't for anyone. Spreads can be monstrous; swaps, onerous; and the weird margin requirements a tough sell. Naturally, they have periodically looked attractive from a price movement perspective, but that attractiveness can also spell trouble from an exposure perspective if your open position is weighing on your portfolio's exposure. There are plenty of pips to be made in less volatile pairs ... . 5. Believing That I Could Effectively Trade the News (or Do Anything Else that Wasn't a Good "Fit" for My Trading Style) . Truth be told: I suck at trading the news. I have tried Donchian channels (a breakout strategy), entering on the first 5 min. candle after the announcement, and various other shenanigans that have proved to be frustrating for me from a profitability standpoint. To a certain extent, I think it's simply that I lack the patience to watch the chart and wait for a proper entry. That's just me. The same thing, I think, would go for scalping. I like to scalp, but I don't have the patience or time to "plan my trades and then trade my plan" for the scalping strategy (finger trap) I would like to use in the vast majority of cases. The Best Changes 1. Realizing that Signals, Etc. Are Inherently Unsatisfactory. Relying on someone else to decide to enter a trade is extremely attractive; what if, after, I could make money by virtually doing nothing? Unfortunately, signal providers can be good, but they are rarely good all the time; if you catch a signal provider with fairly good stats in a bad streak, you're screwed (it's easy to find statistically successful signal providers in, for example, ZuluTrade; you'll see the good stats and ... then you'll see all the thread comments about "What the hell are you doing?", "Why did you open that trade?", "Why are you settling for 2 pips?" -- in short, a virtually endless stream of criticism about how the whole signal is suddenly a piece of crap). For me, I not only want modestly good performance; I want consistently modestly good performance, which for me means 3-9% per month. At the very least, I would think it reasonable not to expect a net loss over a four weeks of trading; heck, I'm able to get at least 0.5% or .25% in any given month ... . Aren't these guys supposed to be "experienced" traders with tested methodologies? Well, you get the gist ... . 2. Realizing that I Suck at Single Point Entries. There are plenty of traders out there who go for "single point," "one shot, one kill" entries. They look for at least a 2-1 risk reward for their set-ups, fashion their entry orders, and then, basically, walk away from the trade. If they're right, they're right; if they're wrong as to the timing of that entry, they potentially stop out at a loss, and it is game over for that trade. It's great if you can be successful that way, but it makes very little statistical sense to me. Wouldn't you want essentially four or five chances to get an average entry that was more on the money that the "single point" entry? Don't markets inevitably whip around from time to time, making the exactitude of any given single entry problematic? 3. Realizing that Stop Losses Can Erode Profitability in a Non-Single Point Entry Methodology or Where Advantageous Positive Swap is Present . I know, I know ... . Crazy not to use stop losses, right? SL's, I think, have a good role to play in "single point" entry methodologies where you're putting your entire position on the line in one shot. Even there, though, I have trouble wrapping my mind around one's wanting to take a stop-out at potentially one of the least advantageous prices available. I naturally understand one's wanting to cut short further loss, but wouldn't you want to cut short your loss at some other point than the point furthest away from your entry? Just sayin' ... . Moreover, a large number of my trades take into account positive swap where there is an advantage to holding onto a position for the longest period of time possible. In those particular cases, I don't necessarily want to take profit too soon, and I certainly don't want the position to stop out when I am holding it, in part, due to positive swap associated with the position. Lastly, and this is just purely anecdotal, it has been my experience that a good number of stop-outs result from impulsive price movement or "stupid wicking," after which substantial retracing occurs. It is enormously aggravating to have your trade stop out only to look at the chart several hours later and realize a retrace has taken place that would have hit your TP were you to have not had an SL in place. From that standpoint, my not using SL's is out of pure aggravation that this circumstance occurs from time to time. (I understand that there are studies that have looked at SL vs. no-SL setups that find that SL set-ups are more profitable than non-SL ones; however, these were systems that used "single point" entry systems). 4. Realizing that With a Multiple Entry System, You Don't Need to Let Winners "Run". I know that the standard adage is to "let your winners run; cut your losers short." With a multiple entry system like mine, though, you can have a little of both. I can naturally lock in modest profits on the legs I've got open in a pair, but I can also set up orders for additional entries to catch continuation should that occur. 5. Realizing that the Rule of "Not Adding to Losers" is a Load of Crap for a Multiple Entry System. Now I know that there is a thin, philosophical line between adding to a losing position in an effort to move your price closer to current market price versus taking multiple inexact entries in order to get a good, average entry price. Some traders consider the former rule as one should not be violated; the latter one an "okay" thing to do. My methodology is designed to get a good average entry that I can exit net profitable; that being said, it generally has the effect of moving my average position price closer to market price, making the position easier to exit net profitably. (If it makes people feel better about doing things this way, I feel dirty every time I add to a losing position .... ). In an ideal world, I would only add to my winners, since all of my entries would be perfectly timed, but that naturally doesn't happen all the time or even a majority of the time (although I have read of traders saying that they can guess trend correctly 70-85% of the time using a 20 EMA and, for example, the color of the immediately preceding heikin-ashi). But the fact is that the market is not an "ideal" world; you take what it gives you ... . 6. Realizing that Smaller Is Better. I've probably repeated this a million times in this and other threads dealing with risk management, trade position size, and overall market exposure size. The basic rules of thumb are: no more than 1 x equity per position and no more than 10 x equity for total exposure. Naturally, even I violate these rules from time to time when I've got a series of trades going. Unfortunately, the fact is that if you adhere to these rules, your progress will be comparatively slow. You won't become a millionaire overnight, in a week, or even a year, especially if you're starting out with some pitifully small sum. You won't be making 1,000% per month like some of the Trade Explorers show. But ... you'll survive . You'll make mistakes, but you won't blow your account up, and you'll sleep far better at night with open positions since, even if one of those positions goes terribly awry, your account will be there tomorrow, and there will be no margin call. Although I don't think this month (December) is really representative of these risk management practices (went a bit large on some positions and overall exposure creeped up to 15 x equity at one point), it does show that you can still be profitable without going totally overboard on per position/overall exposure ... . I remain amazed at traders who are able to do a "single point" entry for 20 times equity and not be on pins and needles every time they open their platform. 7. Considering All Your Open Positions as a "Basket". From time to time, I open my platform and, lo and behold, I am in net profit for all the positions I have open at that time. Naturally, there are losers in there, and there are winners in there, but the winners outnumber the losers. That may be the time at which to consider yourself lucky and close out all your positions as a net profitable "basket" rather than looking at whether each individual position is in the money. * * * Naturally, I am looking forward to a less "educational" 2015 (i.e., more profitable). After all was said and done in 2014, my "education" cost me about $1,701 (it was looking like a marginally profitable proposition toward the end of September, after which I proceeded to muck it up with a costly USD/RUB short carry trade). I regard that $1,701 as my tuition ... , and am hopeful that my "degree" will pay off this coming year ... .

For the live, a positive month to end the year (1700+pips) (albeit a little rough around the edges): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Starting Balance 3958.93 Ending Balance 4342.03 Net Profit: 383.10 ROI: (4342.03/3958.93) = 9.68% Better than the demo ... . This may be partly due to the fact that legs for most positions were .5 x equity (unlike the demo, where they were .25 x equity per leg). Unfortunately, though, I was unable to do the kind of "global close" (closing all positions in the portfolio as a basket) in the live as I was in the demo; I still have a GBP/AUD short position open that is some 240 pips away from break even. Price has broken the 1H 200 Period SMA, but things have been so unsettled since I initiated the position that I figured I'd let the pair settle a bit, rack up the positive swap associated with the position, and take more cautious additions than I did in the demo. I am unsure if this is the way to go if I want to exit the position in short order and free up the margin associated with it; I may have to get a little more aggressive with lot sizing when I do make additions ... . In the demo, I treated the lot size of the open position as though it represented a certain number of entries (for example, four), divided the entire position by that number, and then proceeded to make additions using that particular lot size. For example, the GBP/AUD position is currently 19k; I could treat that as though four, equal sized entries were made, each of equal size (19/4=4.75, which I would round up to 5 ...) (something to think about after this truncated trading week is over, after which I will revisit the GBP/AUD chart to see what price is doing; last time I checked, it appeared that it might be falling into a short-term range, but I'd naturally prefer if it would just break more convincingly lower ... . ) Here's what I have open going into the New Year: EUR/USD short at 1.22098/TP 1.20000 (Market Price Currently 1.21002) (+109.6 pips) GBP/AUD short at 1.88499/TP 1.88400 (Market Price Currently 1.90880) (-238.1 pips) GBP/CAD short at 1.80830/TP 1.80050 (Market Price Currently 1.80955) (-12.5 pips) GBP/USD short at 1.55666/TP 1.55000 (Market Price Currently 1.55771) (-10.5 pips) USD/JPY long at 119.937/TP 120.750 (Market Price Currently 119.892) (-4.5 pips)

Purely an afterthought: I am amazed that I did not jack up my demo in the same way I jacked up my live ... . You would think that it would have been the exact other way around; toying with goofy stuff in the demo (which is what you should do) and staying conservative in the live ... . But noooooo ... . I did goofy stuff in the live; conservative stuff in the demo ... . My thought on that is that folks are looking at the Trade Explorer, and I want to show at least some degree of success at achieving the goals outlined in it trading in the manner in which I describe, so perhaps a bit of self-consciousness about achieving (in this case) a 6% monthly ROI/a 100% annual ROI is beneficial to the trading demo, but not so much with the live. I'll remedy that in the coming year by doing a TE with live funds, but it is simply just not as much fun playing with $4,000 as it is with $50,000 (even if it is imaginary). Happy New Year, FF community!!!!

Why I Post So Much I recently came across a thread and some comments about the inverse relationship between the number of posts one makes here, there, or elsewhere and a given poster's degree of success in trading. The consensus seems to be that successful traders don't have the time, need, or inclination to post, which is entirely possible. However, I think that any relationship between a given trader's posting and their success is quite beside the point ... . One of the standard pieces of advice given to traders is that they should keep a trading journal. There are various reasons for this, but I think that the best reason of them all is that, at least for me, it is part of the process of planning my trades and trading my plan. Posting or writing in some type of journal of my plans for the coming session, week, or whatever is a step in my process as much as looking at the econ calendar is or reading articles about various forecasts or other people's ideas as to where a pair is going or what the fundamentals are saying at a particular point in time. Naturally, one can do journal entries in their own private journal that no one else can see, and that, I think, is a perfectly fine way of doing things if you're more comfortable with doing that as part of your process. Personally, I post here largely out of convenience: I'm running a TE (albeit a demo), am already on the site, and it seems to make perfect sense to post here at the same time. Moreover, if someone can possibly benefit one way or another from what I post (especially the dramatically stupid stuff I have done), then great ... .

Live Account Current Open Positions EUR/GBP short at .78303/TP .77550 EUR/USD short at 1.22098/TP 1.17000 USD/JPY long at 119.873/TP 120.700 Penders (Entry Generally at 200 EMA (1H and Above)/ZigZag Indicated Exit) Attached Image Usable Margin: 99.14%/Usable Maintenance Margin: 98.28% Notes Holy crap! Some rips lower right out of the gate in early Asian ... . Unfortunately, I was unable to adjust my TP on that GBP/AUD short to give me a better exit price (gap down + impulsive rip lower). Oh, well, got out of the position net positive. I'm assuming that most of these rips are attributable to traders who exited dollar long at the end of 2014 to lock in gains and who are now wading back in ... . EUR/USD has now broken 1.2. Where does it go from here? Fundamentals still say lower ... . You'll have to drag your monthly chart out for the pair to potentially see where: the 11/05 low of 1.164 is a possibility, as is 1.124 (the .382 from the 10/2000 low of .823 to the 7/08 high 1.6038). That being said, the .50 Fib is, in relative terms, just slightly overhead at 1.2163, so it is also within the realm of contemplation that there could be a bit of consolidation here or a bounce higher before lower (I'm not an Elliott wave guy, but Elliott wave analysis might help here ... ). For my part, I am now targeting a level slightly above that 11/5 low (1.17) and will add to the position on bounces ... . USD/JPY may also proceed higher on renewed Greenback strength/continued Yen weakness. A similar long-term outlook is necessary here: drilling out to the Monthly is required to see where we may go from here. Currently, price is at the .618 Fib created by the line drawn from the 8/1998 high of 147.59 to the 10/11 low of 75.32, with the next level of interest being the .764 at 130.53. The alternative is to draw a line from the more recent 1/02 high of 135.15 to the aforementioned low, which shows that current market price is right at the .764 level for that line, so there may be some resistance at this level to move higher to 135.15 (the 1 Fib) -- resistance that we've basically already seen in the pair's hesitation to break 121 ... . Ultimately, for me, I naturally wish I'd gotten in earlier on the trajectory or, alternatively, gotten in earlier and stayed in (I was in and out of the part for part of its break upward starting at around 103, but turned my interest to other pairs), so I'm likely to settle for getting in and then bailing out as more near-term targets are hit, especially since the Yen seems to be particularly sensitive to risk-on/risk-off environments which may wreak havoc on longer-term set ups at this point. Consequently, my near-term target for now is the modest 120.75 level, where resistance has appeared in the last few weeks. My affinity for continuing to trade EUR/GBP, EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD is centered on the fact that they are basically weak/weak pairings that are amenable to a certain amount of rangeyness and EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD short continue to offer good positive swap in the event I'm required to hold them to endure an unfavorable bounce. I have tweaked my entries somewhat to base them on the 200 EMA. Sometimes this will be the 30 min. 200, sometimes the 1H, and sometimes higher time frames, with the predominantly used time frame being the 1H. To a certain extent, I look at where the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points are and see what a reasonable entry level is in light of the previous day's movement, always verifying that the fashioned entry is below the relevant 200 EMA if I am going short and above it if I am going long. Naturally, you can fashion entries all at once for the 30 min., 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, etc. 200 period EMA's and then tweak them as the EMA changes, but I'm choosing to generally make only one entry per day so as to avoid the orders executing a bunch of entries all at once, for example, during extreme wicking or remarkably impulsive price movement which could signal a reversal of the trend of which I am taking advantage and which would militate in favor of waiting to make additions until a break of the 200 EMA. Unfortunately, I wish it could be an exact science, but sometimes price action is consolidative and in a narrow range; that might be an instance where you would want to move to a higher time frame to avoid a bunch of entries in a narrow band ... . My current EUR/GBP short addition is a good example of this. I have one leg that is a mere 11.5 pips above current price and right at where the 1H 200 EMA is currently sitting. To me, it makes little sense to take another leg at this level, so I drilled out to the 4H, and fashioned an entry slightly below the 4H 200 EMA which is also above the current .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point for my next leg. With exits, I am generally using a ZigZag to point out where a good exit might be or settling for an exit at the appropriate pivot point (.764 if long; .236 if short).

Ideally, I would want a large enough balance to trade legs that are 2/5th's x equity (twice as large as the legs in the demo), but 2/5th's of 4342 is actually less than a 2k lot, so I'm rounding up for now until I can add funds either at the end of this month or the beginning of next. The alternative would be to trade 1/5th x equity per leg or 1k lots per leg for now, 2k lots at $10,000, 3k lots at $15,000, etc., but it would take a good while to get from here to $10,000 doing 1k lot legs ... .

Right now the position only consists of one leg, so there isn't much to peel off ... . With USD/JPY, we've seen a dip, but I'm going to hold off adding another leg for now since price has broken the 1H 200 EMA, and it may move temporarily lower, providing additional (and better) buying opportunities. Although I'm not at break even for that position, I'll peel off any less favorably entered legs should we move higher ... . I am now targeting 123.50.

Short-term, it looks like we may be entering a short-term consolidation period/decrease in volatility in advance of FOMC or in in connection with traders' beginning-of-the-year positioning, and I think that capturing these little intraday price movements are the way to go, at least temporarily. Demo With the demo, I'm doing something more akin to the live due to the fact that using the 200 Period EMA as an entry requires constant tweaking, since the average changes as candles close. Instead, I am using Hayseed's Box Fib indicator and using it on the 1H chart with the indicator set to the past 24 bars and doing entries and exits in a similar fashion to the live due to time constraints and keeping a more watchful eye on price's relation to the 200 Period EMA than I have previously.

The demo has additional entries that the live does not have. This is because the demo uses "rolling" Fib Retracement Pivot Points. For example, if you set the demo Fib indicator to 24 bars on the 1H chart (representing price and their respective Fibs for the past 24 bars), those pivot points change with each additional bar/candle. The Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points on the live represent the previous trading day's price which do not change throughout the trading day until the New York close, at which new Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points are formed. Ordinarily, there is not a great deal of difference between the two, but if I get on the platform particularly late (for example, three hours after the close of the New York session), there may be a slight difference between the demo and live entry/exit prices (which is what happened yesterday). For purposes of the stats, I am going to be using the balance to calculate whether the particular goal is being achieved. In my mind, a trade is not a loss or a gain until it's closed, but I also fully understand the importance of looking at where the equity is at in relation to the actual balance and that some folks might consider a particular goal not achieved in light of that. It's just easier for me to do the math using the balance figure ... . Moreover, my tendency has been to close all open positions out (regardless of where they're at (i.e., in profit or otherwise)) once the equity equals the monthly goal, and then to start on the next month's goal from there -- from a clean slate. Speaking of those goals (6% per month for the demo; 12% for the live), on one level I find them somewhat ridiculous, at least in comparison to, for example, my retirement account returns. Here's the 2014 results for the various funds in which I can invest my retirement funds: Attached Image These are the only funds I can choose from ... . The best performing fund out of them, the so-called "C" fund, is a fund intended to replicate S&amp;P 500 returns, coming in with a return of 13.78% for 2014. Yes, that's 13.78% for the entire year which most consider quite "good"; most folks are more than happy with an average annual rate of return of 7% or greater. In comparison, I'm shooting for that kind of return in less than 3 months for the demo and less than 1 1/2 months in the live. In fact, I've achieved 24.91% ROI on the demo since it's October 2014 inception. Now I understand that equities fund managers for 401(k)'s here in the U.S. are subject to various rules, can't do a variety of things you could do were the money not parked in a 401(k), that you're getting various tax advantages from having the money parked there (if you're in a traditional 401(k) and not a Roth), and that you're also probably getting some employer matching of funds that you contribute. So, there are various advantages to contributing to your 401(k) for your retirement here in the U.S. The disadvantage is that you're handing your money over to fund managers who are taking astronomically large fees from the overall fund for essentially just replicating what (in the case of the "C" fund) the S&amp;P does, a fee that they collect regardless of the performance of the fund. Point in fact, it is entirely possible that all you're paying these managers to do in this particular kind of set-up is to go out into the market for you and purchase an ETF based on the S&amp;P 500 ... . A monkey could do that, and for less than the fees these fund managers are charging (probably for a banana ... ). So my question becomes, is even a 6% per month goal (which I've indicated in one of the posts would result in a 100% return per year, although it's really something between 6 and 7%/per month) realistic? I think it is (even though the prospect of an annual return of 100% when compared to the paltry 14% made by the "best" fund in my 401(k) plan just seems ludicrous). Here's an article I stumbled across when researching the subject: https://www.dukascopy.com/fxcomm/fx-...90&amp;language=en Now, naturally, this involves stats from 2011, but I can't imagine that the spectra of performers is that much different today. The discouraging thing is that only one exceeded 100% ROI and, unfortunately, the author of that article points out that the average of all profitable forex money managers was a paltry 18.65% and that the average 1-year profit of all forex money managers (both profitable and unprofitable) was less than 5% per year (which is absolutely terrible; I may as well keep my money in one of those 401(k) funds). The vast majority of these guys must either (1) suck hard; or (2) 100% per year is nearly unachievable ... . I may be fooling myself, but I just can't believe that it is anything other than a case of these so-called "professionals" sucking and sucking hard with their once a month, moon-shot 2-1 risk-reward ratio trades ... . A few of the live TE's posted here more than disprove the notion that 100% per year is not achievable (although I wish there was not only a weekly, monthly, and annual ROI for the live TE's, but also a "since inception" ROI ... .). Only time will tell ... .

A side note on the goals: I think that consistency is the key, but that is harder said than done. On the demo side, the 6% goal came somewhat easily in both October and November, after which I proceeded to muck things up in December, climbing up the ladder with EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD instead of waiting to make additions. Doing that made it harder to achieve the goal, increased intratrade drawdown past ideal levels, and required some mathematical sizing of legs to offset too many additions, something you just don't want to do except in all but the most unusual situations (if at all). It all came out fine in the end, but could just as easily been a much longer waiting game, greater drawdown intratrade, and the like. So, patience, patience, patience ... . Currently, patiently waiting for the open to make additions/entries ... .

USD/JPY, like EUR/USD, is one of those pairs that I take a longer-term view on and want to attempt to get greater pippage out of if possible. Consequently, I want to get in at a good price and then ride it for awhile (in comparison to my other trades, which I ordinarily want to get in and out of in under a week if at all possible). I want to go long, but multiple time frame analysis is getting in the way of that, at least at this point in time. Short-term, UJ looks bearish, having broken the 1H 200 EMA, after which it proceeded to do somewhat of a nosedive toward 118: Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the 4H, price is sitting right on top of the 200 EMA: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not that the 200 EMA is the be-all and end-all of all moving averages, but the pair could be poised for a break lower, and I naturally don't want to buy it at this juncture if that is going to occur. On the daily, the 200 EMA is still bullish: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... with the 200 EMA value currently at 109.225 (way below current price), the RSI at 47.15 and trending down. I have considered the fact that the pair might be rangebound, with a ceiling at around 120.75 and a floor around 118, but both of these are somewhat messy and ill-respected. Ugh, maddening. But one thing I've learned is that if you are doubting as to whether you should enter a particular trade a particular point, then you should probably just pass on it, which is what I'm going to do here. Naturally, should price dip all the way to that mid-December 2014 low of around 115.50, I'd probably bite on a long ... .

Other pairs are modestly above the .764, so it makes sense to wait on additions in that case as well in they event they go higher; all in all, I'm only setting up one order to add to a position and that is to the GBP/USD short, price for which is setting just smidgens below the .764 (and which executed while I was writing this post, so the GBP/USD TP will be moved to the .236 or to +10 pips for the net position, whichever is greater ... ).

The notion behind this whole "system" (if you can call it that) is to spend a minimal amount of time watching the screen, ideally hopping on around the New York close, setting up the entry orders and then leaving them alone until the next New York close, at which time you consider additions and new positions. I am still watching USD/JPY for a long entry; the 1H 200 EMA continues to have a downward tilt to it, and it may be temporarily rangebound between 118.00 and 120.00 -- plenty to work with, but I still don't want to get in here if the Yen is going to strengthen due to, for example, U.S. equities markets being down due to oil prices (which in turn affect oil companies and oil companies stock prices). I think we saw a similar thing occur in mid-December when we saw a drop in price down to 115.50 (which I regret not getting in on, although my rules would have told me to wait for a re-cross of the 200 EMA after that dip, which would have been about 117.40 ... .).

A minor correction to what I posted earlier regarding the difference between Trading Station's Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points versus Hayseed's Boxed Fib indicator ... . With TS's Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points: when set to "Daily", the indicator takes the previous day's high and low and makes its pivot point calculations from there. It does not change throughout the trading day regardless of whether price breaks the previous day's high or low. With Hayseed's Boxed Fib indicator: when set to 24 bars on the 1H (which equals 24 1H bars or 1 day's worth of 1H bars), the indicator will recalculate the Fib lines if price makes a new high/low ... . They will otherwise stay the same if, during the previous 24 bars, the high and low have not changed. It usually does not make a huge difference for me, since I am setting up most of my trades at a given point of the day (around the New York close), but this is why there is a slight bit of difference between the trades in the demo versus the live ... . In any event, Hayseed's indicator is posted here at Post 175: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=462458&amp;page=9 ... Incredibly handy ... .

Demo The demo is pretty much in the same game as the live, with one exception of note. When you drill out to higher time frames on GBP/CAD, you'll notice that it is fairly range-bound between 1.85 and 1.75 (huge range, obviously). The entry order is based upon the Daily chart and is toward the top of its 24-day range (particularly at the .764 of that range) ... . My sense is that for range-bound pairs like EUR/CAD (if you drill out to the 4H, the 200 EMA is flat as a pancake), relying upon the 200 EMA to guide trend direction won't necessarily be that useful, since you may catch the pair toward one end of the range ... . Instead, drilling out to see if the pair is particularly rangebound over a period of time may be more useful. Here is the EUR/CAD 4H Chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We naturally had that huge, mid-December deviation, but the 200 EMA was perturbed quite little by that event, which only lasted about two weeks before price reverted to the mean ... .

EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD were moving against my short positions due to a drop in oil, and the remaining positions had moved somewhat distantly from my entries Overnight, however, the SNB unexpectedly abandoned the 1.2 floor, which sent EUR and GBP crosses tumbling; oil prices surged, restoring some strength in the Loonie; and all of a sudden, I am out of all of my positions ... .

USD/JPY Long So I initiated a long in USD/JPY shortly north of 116. The size of the entry is the usual, conservative size (&lt;1/5th 1 times equity). One-half of that position will be disposed of should price strike the current .764 Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point, with the remainder being allowed to run to the 10-Day .764, which is currently at 119.5-ish. Naturally, I'll add to the position where it is opportune, as well as potentially tweak the TP if things go awry or price moves in my favor. I don't want to overthink the trade, but my basic notion is that the pair has been moving sideways between 115.5 and 121 or so for some time now; if that notion is somewhat correct, I am buying at the bottom of the range ... .

Consequently, there's no way I'll make my goal in the live ... . I understand that FXCM obtained a $300 million bailout loan financed over 2 years at 10% interest. They simply are not generating the kind of income required to pay this loan back in that time period, so I think it is only a matter of time before they either have to shut down entirely or are acquired by some other entity ... .

Down to one of two platforms: CitiFx and E*Trade. I'm currently leaning toward CitiFx due to (1) U.S. publicly traded; (2) U.S. regulated; and (3) market cap. I thought about Oanda , but it's not publicly traded, so I can't really check on their current financial well-being ... . Like their philosophy, trading model, etc., but don't want another FXCM experience with a company whose financials are opaque ... . I've deleted out the SixPercenter TE ( ); it was based on an FXCM demo, which will probably expire shortly after I actually close out the FXCM live account.

Was FXCM's Failure Due to the Fact that Its Traders "Suck Harder"? Homework on FXCM, Oanda, CitiFx, and ETrade ... . Well, when I said earlier that not everything about Oanda is necessarily transparent (because they are not publicly traded), I dug a little more into Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filings, which are a snore, but here's the CFTC filing data as of 11/30/14 for various companies registered with the CFTC: http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/publi...cmdata1114.pdf ... and you can kind of see immediately why FXCM got into trouble ... As of 11/30/14, FXCM only had $14,584,303 of funds in excess of required capital, which at that time was only $31,424,016. Put another way, FXCM was maintaining less than 1/2 of its required capital in excess; Oanda, more than twice, and it clearly would never have been enough to survive a $225 million negative equity balance: FXCM: Required: 31,424,016 Excess: 14,584,303 Total Amount of Retail Forex Obligation : 238,480,311 Oanda: Required: 26,104,387 Excess: 57,022,159 Total Amount of Retail Forex Obligation: 132,087,732 CitiGroup Global Markets: Required: 1,100,614,141 Excess: 4,270,110,326 Total Amount of Retail Forex Obligation: Not Reported For that matter, Oanda would not have survived such a hit either, even if you adjust the potential magnitude of it to Oanda's size relative to FXCM. When interviewed about the hit that Oanda took, Oanda CEO Ed Eger was somewhat evasive regarding the question of how exactly Oanda fared and was able to forgive clients' negative balances, merely citing the fact that they were amply capitalized. http://www.bloomberg.com/video/how-o...NQk1sldtA.html Part of the answer as to why FXCM took such an oversized hit may be in the fact that FXCM retail traders as a whole, suck harder than Oanda's. Depending upon which quarter you look at, Oanda retail clients are frequently 10% or more profitable as a group as compared to FXCM clients (e.g., 2014 2Q; Oanda clients: 45.5% profitable; FXCM: 33.0%, http://www.scribd.com/doc/242954766/...Preview#scribd ). Naturally, the answer to why that is so is elusive.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Oanda has an algorithm that allow for variable position sizing. This means that you can tailor your risk down to the penny, and it also allows for stacking and variable TP strategies without worrying about FIFO. So traders have many more tools at that broker than at FXCM.

Thanks for the info ... . I may PM you to see how they've been ... . I've looked at their general, Java-based platform, and I am not particularly fond of it (although I confess I haven't played with it much); I'd probably just go with MT4 if I went with them, since I have MT4 custom indicators that I would want to use. E*Trade, I think, is off the table for me as an alternative to FXCM. Basically, if you're trading forex with E*Trade, you're dealing with FXCM: Attached Image ... got through most of their online app before realizing this ... . I've submitted an app to CitiFxPro, but getting that set up will probably take days; the thing that blows about them is that they may deny my application to trade forex if they think the asset class I want to trade is too risky for my financial profile ... . Can't believe that I may have to circle back to FXCM out of sheer frustration ... .

I kind of like the "unit" model as opposed to the 1k increment model; easier to start extremely small and scale up/compound ... . Moreover, with those kinds of increments, you can test strategies live with extremely small amounts before going whole hog ... . I'm fine at this point with 1k increments, but 1 unit increments would have been really nice at the start, especially were I to have been starting out with less than $2k US. I've always been one to advocate that, when starting out, people go absolutely miniature with their lot sizes, look at their performance with those, and then examine whether those sizes should be increased, always keeping in mind rule-of-thumb exposure rules ... .

--- 帖子 #680 ---
That java platform is ridiculously clumsy, but the pricing model cannot be beat. I use MT4 for the charting and trade with fxtrade. Works well for me. I have been with Oanda for my entire FX career, so I can say that I have never traded demo for the reasons you said in your other post. I can live test strategies with 10 bucks if I need to.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Thanks for the info. That's kind of the set up I have with FXCM ; there's stuff in MT4 that just isn't in Trading Station (various little clever MQ4 indicators that people have developed over the years that I have taken a shine to), and there's stuff in Trading Station that just makes it easier to actually execute trades and that displays various information about trades in a format that I prefer. I guess my frustration, in part, is due to the fact that I'm basically sidelined while FXCM sorts its stuff out (they claim to be doing "biz as usual", but that doesn't necessarily equate with my having the same level of confidence in them) or I just move to a new broker. I've got Oanda set up and just need to fund it; FXCM is still in the process of disgorging what I had with them (which frankly wasn't much, under $5k that was basically being run as live methodology test ... ). Oh, well, sometimes taking a break is a good thing ... . I just hadn't planned on taking a break right here ... .

--- 帖子 #682 ---
But just to be fair to FXCM, I put in the withdrawal request on Friday morning ... . I am assuming the standard 3-5 biz days will apply to the withdrawal, so I won't start to get concerned until the end of next week ... . TS still indicates that the funds are still there, but I don't want to open positions with those funds ... . I also requested a new MT4 account with them at virtually the same time in the event I decide to stick with them ... . This will allow me to both trade via MT4 and via Trading Station; apparently the way I've got it set up now (which opened an account just in TS), I can't access the current TS account in MT4 ... .

While I have a little bit of time, figured I'd calculate the ROI MTD for the live: Live Goal Starting/Current Balance/ROI to Date: $4342.03/$4673.42/7.63% This Month's (January) Goal (Percent): 12.0% This Month's Profit/Ending Balance Goal (Dollars): $521.04/$4863.07 Distance to Goal (Dollars) from Balance: $189.65 Next Compounding Increase (In Lots): To .03 lots Next Compounding Increase (Dollar Level): At $7,500 Balance May end up just leaving these funds here for now ... .

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Ultimately, decided to let the sub-$5k ride in the FXCM account (FXCM was able to cancel out the pending withdrawal request), since I'm more itchy to trade than continuing to fiddle around with a broker search ... . Still have to find somewhere to park an additional $30k, though, so that broker search was not for naught ... . I'll continue to ponder that ... .

At some point, I may want to look at initiating a position in USD/CHF (long) against a backdrop of Fed tightening and ... What exactly is the SNB doing? Easing, I guess, by dropping its interest rate below 0%. Obviously, though, the pair has some sorting out to do (to say the least): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Moreover, the margin requirement for the pair is currently prohibitive (right now, it's 10 x what USD/JPY requires). Naturally, I'll also keep an eye on other CHF crosses, but it is likely that they will also be equipped with onerous margin requirements for quite a bit of time (EUR/CHF is 20 x what USD/JPY requires; CHF/JPY -- 13 times USD/JPY requirement).

--- 帖子 #686 ---
So, I've got two weeks left to trade in this month and $189.65/4.37% left to get to the goal ... . Seems like I have some work to do. However, half way through the month, I am more than halfway to the goal, so I guess I should be happy with that. That being said, I don't set these goals necessarily to achieve them, but to see if they can be achieved using a particular exposure level or a particular lot size per leg without getting into some huge intratrade drawdown, which, to say the least, is unpleasant. Naturally, if I can achieve a particular goal (in this case, 12%) with a particular leg size, I don't see a need to go bigger or expose myself to a greater degree ... . 12% per month, after all, will eventually get you to that million with patience and consistency ... .

While no one can really say that EUR/USD will make it to parity, it is kind of pointing in that general direction, so I am going to continue to short on bounces until the charts tell me to do something else ... . I see the whole "Fed tightening" thing as a painfully slow, measured, process over several months, if not years ... . Cable has been basically moving sideways since the end of the first week of the year; I'll continue to short Cable crosses against a backdrop of Fed tightening, but will look at crosses on a case by case basis, since some of them (GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD) tend to be quite frisky/volatile. Moreover, I've always got BOE tightening in the back of my mind; they're not there yet, but they sure want to be there ... . For Yen crosses, I am largely going to confine myself to USD/JPY. Not that there is anything wrong with the other Yen crosses, it just seems to me that the Yen is subject to a lot of that risk-on/risk-off junk and is overly sensitive to U.S. market performance with folks fleeing back and forth between the Greenback and the Yen, depending on which how the S&amp;P or Nikkei is doing. My only request there is that UJ please get on with its trend or fall into some insanely clean range that I can work ... . The fundamental outlook, after all, is one of Fed tightening and, well, BOJ flopping about in an attempt to ease ... .

Current Oil Prices : Attached Image I don't trade oil, but I do check in on the price from time to time, not only to see if it's possible for gas prices to go any lower, but also to see how it's potentially affecting trades I'm in, particularly those in the Loonie, since the Canadian economy is so heavily petro ... . That being said, I don't initiate trades in the Loonie one way or the other based on oil prices; I initiate them based what the EUR/CAD or GBP/CAD chart is telling me about their price movement. This is one thing about trading forex as compared to stocks that has taken me some time to wrap my head around. With equities, I was basically "investing" (as compared to "trading") and did a heckuvalot of research before I bought or sold a particular stock. With forex, virtually all my trades are just that -- trades, trades that are intended to capitalize on price movement and little else. If I had to delve into a lot of research as to where a particular pair was going or the absolutely ideal price at which to buy or sell, I would probably rarely enter a trade and would spend most of my time figuring out what the "ideal" price point was, analyzing one currency or the other's strength or weakness at given points in time and various other things that influence price movement. Makes me wonder whether I should examine a return to equities, confining myself to "trading" them, rather than "investing" in them. Not that I wasn't a good stock picker for "investing," but it frankly just took too much time ... which why I now pretty much strictly dollar cost average into an index fund; a lot less work ... .

You may notice that the EUR/CAD and EUR/NZD positions in the "Twelver" TE appear to be in bad shape; that would be a true statement. Most traditional old school traders would have set a stop loss and then been stopped out for a loss already and then moved on ... . What I do with those positions is to hold them ... and wait for the trend to resume (i.e., for price to break below the 1H 200 EMA); until then, I do nothing. With the EUR/NZD in particular, however, I also earn positive swap, so it's actually to my benefit that price doesn't hit the TP right away and that I don't stop out. When I do eventually add to the positions, I add with a similar leg size, and then move the TP to the value of the net position +20 pips ... . Sometimes, I merely have to wait a few days; other times a few weeks to exit the position net positive ... . Patience is key. While I'm waiting for those to resolve, I naturally continue to trade other pairs to my heart's delight, naturally always keeping in mind exposure rules of thumb ... .

I saw your thread and it's very interesting. But i don't understand what is real reference for put Fibonacci. You said pivot point but you seem use zigzag highs and lows...

--- 帖子 #702 ---
If you use Trading Station, there are several different Pivot Point options available ... . Most people use what are called the "Classic" Pivot Points (R1, S1, etc.). But one of the options is what are called "Fibonacci Retracement Pivot Points." These are calculated by taking a particular time period's high and low (e.g., Daily, Weekly, etc.) and determining the Fibonacci levels for those. I use the "Daily" Fibonacci Retracement Pivot Points, which calculate Fib levels based on the previous trading day's high and low (the day runs from New York close to New York close). (I have read of people also using Camarilla Pivot Points for entries and exits, but I haven't really tried those in any depth). If the particular platform you have does not have this particular type of Pivot Point as an option, you can naturally draw a Fib Retracement/Extension line between the previous day's high and low and get Fib levels that way (kind of pain). MT4 has a variety of Pivot Point indicators available, but none of them that I looked at were quite what I was looking for; the closest and best thing to the Trading Station Fib Retracement Pivot Points is Hayseed's "Box Fib Indicator" which I use on a daily basis in MT4 to set up my entries and exits. I gave the ZigZag indicator a bit of a try for entries and exits, but eventually abandoned those in favor of just using the Fibonacci Retracement Pivot Points. The ZigZag is good for showing established support and resistance zones .... . Hope this is helpful ... .

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Here's a really good example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You'll see by the chart that EUR/USD is in a downtrend. Where that is the case, I look to sell the pair and set up an entry order to sell it if and when price strikes the .764 level and to take profit when price strikes the .236 ... . All this particular chart has on it is the 1H 200 EMA and the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points which is all I need to determine (1) trend direction; and (2) entries/exits. Edit: Oops, I guess it does also have the ZigZag indicator on it, too. Quite frankly, I don't really use those much anymore ... .

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Where the 200 EMA is fairly flat or trendless, I may actually draw a Fib line manually from the high to the low shown for the period being used (in this case, the 1H): Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this particular case, you'll see that the 200 EMA wiggles around a bit, but is fairly flat, which indicates to me that the pair is ranging. With a pair that is trendless, I may actually want to take an entry that is more toward one end or the other of that particular range, rather than just confining myself to a day's price movement (which is what I'm doing when I take an entry based upon a Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point). In this particular case, rather than using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Point for my entry, I may opt to choose to use the manually drawn Fib line levels to fashion my entries, for example, fashioning an order to sell EUR/CAD should price strike the .764 Fib of the manually drawn line ... .

Ultimately, I did manage to grap a few more pips for my FXCM today: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I purposely wasn't asking for much out of these; I like to have as few positions open into the weekend as possible. That much closer to the 12% goal ... . (If my math is right, only $106.54 to go ... ). Still have a GBP/CAD and GBP/NZD short open in that account, basically waiting to make additions of legs. Both of those pairs have been uncooperative in breaking back below the 1H 200 EMA, so it might be awhile ... .

Hello Zebra, The 'ZR', or I'd rather call it 'LMD - Let Market Decide' is a nice and tricky idea I also had it on my mind and gave quite a lot of thoughts and calculations to it. I even created an EA I set 'free' and it was just taking the necessary trades as price was passing the price levels. Nevertheless I had to come to terms with that it is just another martingale system with all its drawbacks regarding growing risk versus a constant reward, so sooner or later resulting in a loss. It only worked well in strong trending environments, where you can make profits using all the directional trading methods as well. What happens is when you try to define 100% probability factors in an environment which is statistically not predictable (ie. markets) you end up with other factors with so low overall probability that renders the idea as a whole void. Eg. it is true that price will move away from a certain level, however you cannot tell when and what extent. And then when you start making this strategy work live you may find it tricky to deal with all the technical difficulties of watching the market constantly. Regards, Áron

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Thanks. Now it's clear. I saw interesting alternative way for trading using your rules. If you want trade more short and less risk operations you can draw fibo between pivot points ( i use MT4 ) and only work inside 0.23/0.78 levels. Normally at that levels inside pivot level price do full travel with little reverse risk before touch tp fibo level... I hope this useful for extend your strategy.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
I have doubt with this example. If you use previous H/L ( 1/22 ) for operate day 1/23, how can you sell at 0.76 fibo if day 1/23 is below 0.23 and day 1/21 you can't get that fibo levels you drawed because H/L not happened yet?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Thanks for your comments. As always, it is an ongoing process. I have found that you will always get caught at one point or another in reversals of the prevailing trend (the basis on which you entered the trade in the first place); these can be prolonged or short-lived ... . Hardly a flawless system, I know, from various perspectives ... .

If I understand your question correctly ... . Here's my cycle of doing things, which may answer your question. At the end of the New York close, which is when the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points "reset" based upon the previous day's high/low, I look at all the charts with their Pivot Point levels again. I then usually proceed to delete out the previous day's orders (if they are not "Good for Day" orders, which expire at the end of the New York session and therefore delete themselves) and set up new, Good for Day orders just for that trading day using the newly drawn Pivot Points ... .

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I also looked at that chart again and see what you mean ... . Price on that chart is already below the .236 ... . In that particular case, I set up the order to sell at the .764 anyway, pretty much knowing that it will not execute during that particular trading day (but then again, I've seen weirder stuff happen) ... .

--- 帖子 #712 ---
I've also read about other folks putting more emphasis on the .618 and .382 levels as levels of interest ... . Narrower range, after all, and more likely to hit ... . Truth be told, I haven't tested doing things using those particular Pivot Points as compared to others. At one point late last year, I considered getting an EA set up with the basis rules of the methodolgy and for which I could input which Pivot Points would be used, so I could run strategy tests on which type of Pivot Points were best (Classic, Camarilla, Woodie, Fib Retracement) as well as which particular levels on which to enter an exit ... . Unfortunately, I kind of got side-tracked ... . Still may do that if I get time .... .

My focus continues to remain on shorting Euro crosses with ECB QE having begun and Fed rate increases around the corner (and by "around the corner," I mean some time in 2015 ... ). You'll see me virtually continuously shorting EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, EUR/GBP, and EUR/NZD on bounces until I see some kind of sign that the Euro is bottoming, which might be some time away. My enthusiasm in USD/JPY long has waned somewhat ... . It has been virtually sideways since the beginning of the year. Naturally, that may change, but it's not on any kind of rip right now. I'm satisfied to buy the pair on dips in light of Fed tightening and whatever it is that the BOJ is doing (which has been described as easing). I may turn my attention to EUR/JPY, but that is probably another pair that I should have been keeping an eye on for a short opportunity, but by now have missed most of the run. With the exception of the GBP/USD short I've got open now, I'm hesitant to enter other Cable crosses. With GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD, I generally prefer waiting for short set-up's due to positive swap; with a GBP/CAD set-up, well, I've probably missed the boat on a long for now, so will have to wait until some Loonie strength returns or Cable weakness resurfaces.

In the process of winding down the FXCM live account and am just waiting for a few final trades to clear. The number of changes to per pair margin requirements and the extremely short notice they have given regarding these changes have been more than a little unsettling and require some adaptation, to say the least. They haven't affected my system that much, but their new margin regime does result in a greater use of margin than I like and/or am used to. So, I have decided to open an E*Trade Fx account (yes, even though it uses FXCM as the "referring broker") and move the FXCM funds there. The E*Trade will be more flexible in terms of my being able to move the funds from the FX account to other accounts with the same broker rather than moving funds in and out of an external bank account. Some people, in order to accommodate broker risk of failure, keep cash in their bank and as little as possible with the broker, moving money in when necessary to accommodate positions that may temporarily require greater margin and then moving funds out again. In any event, now is actually when things get interesting (to me, hitting your take profit on the first try isn't "interesting"; it's nice ... just not interesting): Attached Image As you can see, I've got no penders left; they all executed while I was asleep ... . Moreover, they don't appear to be in particularly good shape at the moment. This is where keeping a cool head, exercising some patience, and waiting to make additions comes in. Shortly after the New York close, I'll have a look at all the 1H charts for the pairs I've got open. With the exception of the USD/JPY long, all of the positions are short, so I'll be looking to add shorts at the .764 if and only if price continues below the 200 EMA. If price has broken above the 200 EMA, in most cases I will pass on additions. The other thing I will do is modify TP's where appropriate, moving them to the "new," post-New York close .236 or +20 pips, whichever is greater for the net position. The other thing to watch for is the number of pairs you've got positions open in. Currently, I have trades in 6 pairs open, which is more than I usually like (which is around 4-6; keeps things simple and panic-free). I may consider adding other pairs should one or two of these currently open positions close in profit, but will generally focus on closing out what I've got in profit before diving in to something else. This keeps my exposure managable for my per leg lot size (.5 x equity). Naturally, I could go for more positions were I to just reduce my per leg lot size (some folks seem to be in virtually everything all the time, which I would find maddening -- just me). See you at the New York close ... .

What I Would Trade If I Traded "Everything" As you know if you've read this thread, my trading has mostly focused on shorting Euro crosses (hey, it's all the rave). But if I were to trade "everything," as it were, this is what I would trade. First of all, I'd avoid exotics. They have weird margin requirements, can be volatile, and are therefore a pain to deal with on a day-to-day basis. Secondly, and although I used to like to trade CHF, it's kind of off the table as a trade for obvious reasons ... . That being said, here would be my list: USD Crosses -- 6 Possible Pairs EUR/USD GBP/USD USD/JPY USD/CAD AUD/USD (Long set-ups only due to onerous swap on the short side) NZD/USD (Long set-ups only due to onerous swap on the short side) Euro Crosses -- 4 Possible Pairs EUR/GBP EUR/CAD EUR/AUD (Short set-ups only due to negative swap on the long side) EUR/NZD (Short set-ups only due to negative swap on the long side) Cable Crosses -- 3 Possible Pairs GBP/CAD GBP/AUD (Short set-ups only due to negative swap on the long side) GBP/NZD (Short set-ups only due to negative swap on the long side) Yen Crosses -- 5 Possible Pairs CAD/JPY EUR/JPY GBP/JPY AUD/JPY (Long set-ups only due to negative swap on the short side) NZD/JPY (Long set-ups only due to negative swap on the short side) Aussie/Kiwi Crosses -- 3 Possible Pairs AUD/CAD (Long set-ups only due to negative swap on the short side) NZD/CAD (Long set-ups only due to negative swap on the short side) AUD/NZD (Slightly positive swap on the short side) This would be a total of 21 pairs. Assuming that (1) I used my current method to trade all of these pairs (and some, admittedly, I would hardly every trade since their profile only makes certain set-ups attractive right now (e.g., AUD/USD is in a downtrend, making longs unattractive there and a negative swap is associated with a short)); and (2) used 1k legs and attempted to exit the positions net positive at or before the 5th leg was taken (i.e., 5k max for the entire net position), my total exposure were the unthinkable to happen (5 legs open on all 21 pairs at once), my max exposure to such a scenario would be 105k -- in other words, just a touch more than about 10 times my current equity, which would make it doable ... .

New Positions EUR/AUD Short if price strikes the current .764 w/TP at current .236 EUR/GBP Short if price strikes the current .764 w/TP at current .236 Notes Well, NZD spiked bearish on news that the RBNZ would maintain the current rate, allegedly "leaving the door open" to a rate cut going forward in light of below-target inflation, so I might be in that EUR/NZD short position for a bit as the Kiwi sorts itself out and traders price in a potential rate cut. That's perfectly fine with me as long as price doesn't get too far away from my net position value, since positive swap is associated with this position. I was hoping that the EUR/CAD position would make more positive progress toward my TP in light of today's Euro movement, but ... no deal. This is probably because oil gave up some ground today, which no doubt affected Loonie strength. I considered entering USD/JPY long. It appears short-term range-bound at this point between 117.30-ish and about 118.70-ish, which is plenty of room to work with: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I may ponder that over dinner ... .

Eww. Sometimes you just hate to open your platform ... . This is one of those times. My positions are looking somewhat battered going into the last day of the week and the end of the month, and the charts are telling me to only add positions to my EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and EUR/GBP shorts (the last of which I took at market). Every other pair is just going to require patience and waiting for good additions. For the EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, and EUR/NZD short positions, I need to wait for buyers to exhaust and for a downtrend (temporary or otherwise to resume). I may be waiting for a bit, it seems, but you never know going into a new month, when things tend to get a bit frizzy as traders exit positions at the end of the month and position themselves at the beginning of the next. In looking at the USD/JPY long chart, I am now kind of regretting not going long yesterday. That being said, it still has yet to break out of the range I mentioned yesterday. Tomorrow being Friday and the last trading day of the month, I think I will wait until next week to consider whether it is worthwhile to add another position to the mix, especially since I now have quite a bit on my plate to deal with and don't want to get overexposed ... . Better to have one "dog" position, than three, I say ... . I've now got three arguable dogs (EUR/NZD, EUR/AUD, and EUR/CAD short), and it's probably best to wait until I can close one or two of those out before getting involved in another ... .

In spite of the disruption of the SNB (which left me scrambling researching for brokers other than FXCM out of obvious concern as to whether it would fall like Alpari UK and kept me out of the market for several days), I guess that I should be happy with the results I had with the FXCM account for the month: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The ROI was 10.38% -- somewhat close to the twelve percent goal I had for that account, but falling short ... .

I know that people poo-pah the balance curve (since it does not show current open trades and, in my case, we're in a bit of a drawdown) ... . That being said, I nevertheless often refer to it as a measure of how I'm progressing toward the goal (with naturally the understanding in mind that it assumes that all open trades will be closed either in profit or, at least, break even). Here's the Twelver's balance curve so far: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It's really too little data to say that "I'm on track" to 12% after only ten days or so, but it kind of looks that way. And naturally I understand that it's when equity hits the target that's important, not the balance, so I'll naturally be looking at equity going forward to see whether the 12% goal can be reasonably met. I hope next month goes a little more smoothly. Had a great start out of the gate with the account, after which we got RBNZ and sympathetic AUD movement, Swissie Euro manipulation (looks like the SNB might be showing some remorse for its just letting the peg suddenly go), the BOC's rate surprise, some apparent hesitancy from the FOMC as to the timing of rate increases, ugh ... .

Well, the week could have ended worse ... . It could have ended better, but it could have ended worse ... . That being said, I obviously got caught in parts of pairs' cycles that were unfavorable to me, something that I naturally hope to remedy next week. Naturally, this happens all the time; you're going along, taking solid advantage of a particular trend and then ... BOOM! ... the trend reverses, temporarily or otherwise and you're left holding the bag. For me, the bag is usually larger than most other traders because I do not use stop losses; it is, after all, a mean reversion methodology and I've found that stop losses can get in the way of making money because they stop me out at a less than ideal price, which I find incredibly counterproductive. But the result for the methodology is usually larger drawdowns in the short term, which I have come to terms with. As everyone's no doubt heard a million times, it's how you react to and deal with the drawdown that's important. If you're going to panic, then perhaps you should consider smaller positions the next cycle of trades or positions open in fewer pairs so that you don't start panicking or losing sleep while the drawdown is occurring. This, again, is why you want to demo with constant lot sizes with a constant set of positions open, increasing lot sizes and/or positions to determine what you can handle psychologically. You can then determine what you're comfortable with in terms of drawdown percentage and whether you should adjust your lot sizes or the number of positions in pairs you've got open at the same time when you actually go out and trade funds live. Not everyone's comfortable with a 10% drawdown intratrade; others are able to tolerate 25% plus. I kind of fall somewhere in the middle ... . Naturally, I would prefer 0% drawdown, but we all know that's never going to happen. (This issue is somewhat separate from margin usage. Rule number 1 is, of course, that you never get a margin call. It is commonplace (at least for me, it seems to happen once a month or so) to be enduring what I would consider an uncomfortable drawdown without being anywhere near a margin call. I mean, look at my exposure now in the TE; it's 4:1, but I'm in a 6.1% intratrade drawdown ... .) In any event, when I'm placed in the position I'm currently in, namely, EUR/AUD 1 leg 249 away from TP; EUR/CAD 3 legs 309; and EUR/NZD 2 legs 459, I need to start looking at where I can potentially reduce exposure and/or get out of positions the most quickly net profitable. Ordinarily, my rule is to wait to make additions until price returns to the correct side of the 1H 200 EMA; that way, I don't get caught entering additions at prices if the trend is going to continue to move against me. Where I generally make a discretionary exception to this rule is where the pair is potentially ranging. This is, in fact, why I made two additions to the EUR/CAD position even though price was above the 1H 200 EMA; I thought the pair was in a range, but unfortunately misread exactly how wide that range was (a mistake I admittedly make quite frequently). Now, in fact, the pair is at the top of its range (even though there was a bit of an excursion from that in light of CAD data today): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although things may change with the start of the new week, my likely concentration will be on disposing of that EUR/CAD position on the notion that it is currently at the top of its range. The EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD shorts will be addressed later, most likely after the RBA's rate announcement, which may cause the Aussie to tank even further, depending upon the announcement. Until then, have a good weekend.

Twelver Open Positions EUR/AUD short: Passing on addition; price currently above 1H 200 EMA. EUR/CAD short: Passing on addition; although the pair could be described as in a fairly wide range, I think I'm going to wait ... ; we have some CAD data later in the week that might make the pair a bit jumpy. EUR/GBP short: Passing on addition; price is relatively close to TP, although I may adjust the TP when markets open in about 1/2 hour. EUR/NZD short: Passing on addition; price currently above 1H 200 EMA. New Positions EUR/USD short at the .764/TP .236. Notes I am hesitant to add additional, new positions beyond the EUR/USD short heading into the new week. I'd like to exit at least one (preferably all, of course) of the outstanding positions before dipping my toes in the water further, especially given the current drawdown ... . But if I were the daring sort, I would probably go short EUR/JPY and GBP/USD short in light of the 1H charts as they stand right now. USD/JPY continues sideways in rangebound fashion between 117.50 and 118.50, so that might be a nice range-bound play long at current levels ... .

Twelver February Month-End Goal Starting/Current Balance/ROI to Date: $9835/$9835/0% This Month's (February) Goal (Percent): 12.0% This Month's Profit/Ending Balance Goal (Dollars): $1180/$11,015 Distance to Goal (Dollars) from Balance: $1180 Next Compounding Increase (In Lots): To .05 lots Next Compounding Increase (Dollar Level): At $10,000 Balance Notes The 12% goal for February may be somewhat of a tall order, since I am starting behind the 8-ball being in an approximately $600 drawdown. We'll just have to see how things go. Moreover, I may pass on increasing the per leg lot size to 5 micros upon reaching $10k if things appear to be going okay and the 12% appears achievable.

Looks like another day of waiting to add legs to my open positions. Some progress was made today toward the 1H 200 EMA in most cases, but not enough. Moreover, I want to wait for the RBA rate statement to pass (which may rock the boat in my EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD shorts) before doing anything with those, so everything is pretty much the same as it was yesterday (although my EUR/USD short did execute): Open Positions EUR/AUD short: Passing on addition; price currently above 1H 200 EMA. EUR/CAD short: Passing on addition; price currently above 1H 200 EMA EUR/GBP short: Passing on addition; price currently above 1H 200 EMA (although barely so). EUR/NZD short: Passing on addition; price currently above 1H 200 EMA. EUR/USD short: Passing on addition; current .764 nearly the same as value of initial entry. New Positions None Notes I look at USD/JPY long again and again, but it doesn't seem to want to break higher. Nothing says rangebound like a flat 200 EMA: Attached Image (click to enlarge) However, it might be worth long scalps from 117.25, since this has been an area of resistance in recent days ... . However, the 1H 200 EMA has begun to "droop" toward the end. Although the EMA lags, the "droopiness" (for lack of a better term) indicates that the breadth of the range is decreasing in this particular case in recent days and may indicate waning enthusiasm of buyers to wade in for a push higher ... .

EUR/JPY The other Yen cross pair of interest is EUR/JPY. However, I am quite pissed at myself for not being more attentive to the pair, especially in light of the 4H 200 EMA break at the end of 2014 (at around 145.75), a level from which it has plummeted in the past several weeks: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Unfortunately, the pair now appears to be at a level at which I am hesitant to short. I naturally might reconsider that if the breaks the weekly 200 EMA, which is currently at 129.40; in the scheme of things, that's not all that far below. That being said, I've been somewhat disappointed with the Yen lately, at least when paired with the Greenback. Its strength/weakness appears, at times, manic, probably because it is regarded as a "safe haven" currency into which skittish U.S. dollar investors flee when the U.S. equities markets weaken, temporarily or otherwise. This naturally clouds my fundamental view of Greenback strength in light of Fed tightening and Yen weakness in light of BOJ easing.

Oil Prices I am beginning to learn far more about oil than I ever intended, first in connection with the Ruble, and now in connection with the Loonie. Consequently, I find myself dropping in on price movement in oil on a daily basis. Not that I ever intend to trade oil (not my cup of tea), but oil prices can apparently move the Loonie as much as Copper or Iron Ore can move the Aussie. In any event, oil advanced again today: Attached Image ... no doubt the cause, in part, for my EUR/CAD short's moving more toward its TP. In a related note, sometimes even the "pro's" suck (at least when it comes to commodities which are the whim of a wide variety of factors, some of which are beyond everyone's control (i.e., Mother Nature)).

Using Multiple Accounts to Catch Inevitable Market Cycles One thing I'm noticing just operating two different accounts (one with FXCM , one with Oanda ; additionally, just funded one with ETrade today with no open trades) is the notion of their being cycles in the markets. I am not a big fan of using these "invisible" and somewhat unquantifiable cycles of buying and selling that go on, but you'll obviously notice as you trade for a period of time that the beginnings of weeks, months, and quarters tend to be marked with different market behaviors as traders assess their positions and what trades to get into and out of going forward. Additionally, you'll also notice that a trade that looked great one day goes down the pooper the next. The particular methodology I am using has the potential to catch me in positions for substantial periods of time while I wait for the trend to resume or for the pair to fall into a range that I can get out of net profitable. During these periods, it frequently occurs during the reversion to trend/range process that opportunities appear that would be great as initial entries were I not to be in a position already. This potentially makes it advantageous to cycle in and out of trades on one account, while staggering initial entries on the other to take advantage of the inevitably cyclical nature of the market. A case in point is GBP/CAD. Currently, I am in a GBP/CAD short position in the FXCM account, but not in the Oanda/Twelver account. With the FXCM GBP/CAD short, I am waiting for the pair to resume a downtrend (i.e., cross below the 1H 200 EMA) before adding a leg, but that would also potentially be a good initial entry for the Oanda account, where I don't currently have a position in that pair. In that particular case, staggering the entries by merely a few days may allow for profitable initial entries in one account that are no longer possible in the other due to the fact that a position is already present in that account. Now that I've got three accounts (which is not ideal, two is plenty to juggle), it may be worthwhile to stagger entries between the two (or three), for instance starting to look at initial entries in one on Sunday night, initial entries on the second on Tuesday or Wednesday, and then initial entries on the third on Thursday or Friday. Something to think about ... .

Against my better judgment, fashioned a couple of discretionary entries ... . First, I decided to take an addition to the GBP/CAD short, gambling on a retrace of Cable post-BOE announcement (and it's exactly that, a gamble). Additionally, I decided to fashion an addition to the EUR/CAD short at the .764. It appears to have temporarily fallen into a short-term range, wherein it is likely to fluctuate in light of the fact that oil is probably going to stay between $40-$50/bbl. short-term, and the Loonie will weaken/strengthen somewhat accordingly. Lastly, I decided to take a USD/JPY long at the Daily Fib Retracement .236, with the TP being the 10-day high of 118.80. The pair looks delightfully range-bound, which I generally like trading. My only concern is that range appears to be contracting/consolidating ... .

Starting to get itchy to exit a few of these positions ... . This is not a good thing ... . Closed out the USD/JPY long, thinking that it was continuing to go sideways, which is fine, but I figure I have enough on my plate for now. When I opened the MT4, EUR/NZD was right at the .764 for the past 24 bars, so I added a leg to that position and moved the TP (that in spite of the fact that it is on the wrong side of the 200 EMA (bad boy, violating your own rules)). The only other addition today is a EUR/CAD short entry order should price strike the .764. * * * On a side note, I opened an E*Trade account, and then proceeded to fund it, only then discovering that the minimum trade size was 10k. This would be fine were I not splitting funds across accounts, and I could fund it with at least $20k, but I am not going to do that. ETradeFx uses FXCM's Trading Station, but I found it somewhat glitchy for some reason as compared to the Trading Station platform launched with FXCM. The last thing I need is glitchiness on top of the shuffling of funds around post-SNB ... .

Fortunately, my lack of patience waiting for price to break again below the 200 EMA on 1H (something I should perhaps look at going forward; many of my shorts are in obvious downward trends on higher time frames ... ) didn't hurt me, and sometimes one day (with the right data) makes a difference ... . The Twelver gained 1586 pips over where it started the week and 5.7%. That being said, I'm not hugely thrilled with that since I started the month out with a $600 drawdown in place (which is going to monkey up this month's stats, although the goal is 112% of the previous month's ending balance ). I'll naturally be happier once the EUR/USD hits its TP and/or the EUR/CAD short closes out net profitable. Point in fact, very little has been actually added to my balance this month so far: Attached Image ... and so I view achieving 12% in February as highly unlikely ... . Oh well, that's what a short squeeze will do to your plans. On the FXCM live side, the week was somewhat lackluster with most of the gains being accrued today as a result of positive U.S. employment data and confined to EUR/USD (although I did manage to exit the EUR/CAD position there net positive; that's what that hump's about ... ): Attached Image (click to enlarge) And although I have said that I was swearing off grids, the 10-pip directional grid for EUR/USD proved to be quite a bit of fun, although I was left with one dangler when it was all said and done: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The EUR/USD grid shorts don't represent much in terms of ROI, but every little bit counts while I'm waiting to dispose of the remaining FXCM live positions before I move the funds over to the MT4 account (which I should have done when I had everything closed out toward the end of last month ... ugh).

And one last thing before I lay off before the weekend ... . The FXCM live generally uses Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points. These are calculated based upon the previous day's high and low and remain the same throughout the trading day. In comparison, Hayseed's Boxed Fib Indicator will calculate the Fib lines based upon user input, so it is inherently more flexible. For example, I have been using it on the 1H and setting it to 24 bars (which means that the Fib lines will be calculated based upon the previous 24 hours of candles), but I also look at the Fib lines on the Daily chart for the previous 10 days of price action to see where the previous 24 hours/trading day lines up with price in relation to the previous 10 days of price. In that sense, the Boxed Fib Indicator is far more flexible than Trading Station's Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points, which can be set to the previous hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, day, week etc. of price action, but can't be set up for other time frames that might be attractive to a trader or peculiar to a particular pair's trajectory, which is why I prefer it over TS's "presets." Additionally, for a multiple entry trader like me, it displays the average price of the net position without having to bring up iExposure in MT4 (which appears below the chart), making it easier to set TP's for multiple leg positions ... .

10PipDirectional TE I went ahead and set up a TE for the FXCM MT4. It should be up and running with funds shortly. Pair Focus The TE will focus on pairs with obvious and prolonged trends on higher time frames (Daily) and will largely concentrate on the majors (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY; I may throw in EUR/GBP, too), in order to take advantage of the lower spreads /commissions for these pairs. Basic Set-Up 1. Lot/position sizes will be between .5 times equity and 1 times equity. I have yet to decide on the factor of equity I will use, but given the number of pairs that are likely to be open at any given time, even a 1 x equity per position should provide an adequate safety margin between max position exposure and 10 x equity, which is the maximum exposure I want to have to all open positions at any time. 2. The Grid. The best way to illustrate the set-up is by way of example. EUR/USD, for example, is currently trading at 1.1315. Assuming that I ascertain that EUR/USD is likely to continue lower, the directional grid will be set up as follows: Sell EUR/USD at 1.1310/TP 1.1300. Sell EUR/USD at 1.1300/TP 1.1290. Sell EUR/USD at 1.1290/TP 1.1280. Etc., etc. 3. Size of Grid. In most cases, I will let the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator be determinative of how deep the grid goes, with the last grid level in the series stopping slightly above where the indicator shows is a previous low or slightly below where the indicator shows a previous high is present. 4. "Danglers." With this type of grid, "danglers" are inevitable. This occurs when price hits a grid level and then retraces. I will dispose of these as I would with any Fib Retracement Pivot Point-based entry. In other words, I will add to the position as appropriate using the Fib Retracement Pivot Points as a guide, proceed to adjust the TP for the net position to fit into the directional grid, and add grid levels between the net position TP and the next outstanding grid level, assuming that it is apparent that the direction of the grid is consistent with a pair's long-term trend. 5. ROI Goal. There is no ROI goal for this particular TE.

Twelver ( Oanda Live TE) The EUR/USD short hit its TP nearly straight of the box during the Sydney session, which doesn't leave me with much to dispose of in terms of multiple leg positions: EUR/NZD short (3 legs), EUR/CAD short (3 legs), and EUR/JPY short (1 leg). With respect to the EUR/JPY short, I have revised the TP to the .236, rather than to the lower "3" Semaphore. I'm not terribly excited about the position at this level, my thinking being that I missed out on most of the downward move as I was playing with other pairs. In the grand scheme of things, both the EUR/NZD short and EUR/CAD short are within relatively short striking distance of their TP's, which leaves me feeling a whole lot better about these positions than I was feeling at the beginning of last week, when the short squeeze in Euro crosses had me somewhat concerned. That being said, there is always room for another short squeeze to occur, although at this point most of squeezers probably exited the market and are now looking to get in short again at some juncture, which will push Euro crosses downward in a new cycle (that's the hope anyway ... .) My biggest regret is bailing out of that USD/JPY long mid- to late last week, having been dissatisfied with the pairs movement, only to have it pop 200 pips or more post-NFP. Oh well, can't catch everything ... .

Mmm. Didn't realize that you couldn't do "peg orders" in MT4, which will prevent me from setting up a directional grid in MT4 ... . Guess I'll just have to go for the run-of-the-mill pivot point trading as I do in the Oanda. Bummer. Were it not for FIFO, I've got a splendid directional grid EA that I could run. Oh, well, I guess I can still run the directional in my small Trading Station (only) FXCM ... . Had planned to close that out once a couple remaining trades close. I may need to rethink that ... .

In lieu of the directional grid for the FXCM MT4 account, I am going to base entries and exits on the 30 Min. chart using the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator, so the entries will be quite a bit different from the Fibonnacci Retracement Pivot Point entires on which the "Twelver" is based ... . However, for the time being, the pairs traded will be virtually identical ... .

How Fibs Can Help You Decide if You Should Enter "There" If you look at the "Twelver" at this moment in time, you'll see that EUR/CAD has experienced a bit of a retrace: Attached Image Naturally, this is kind of a short-term bummer; at the opening of the New York session, the net position was close to its TP, and now it isn't. So, did I do something wrong with my additions? Could I have added legs at better prices? Traditionally, after identifying a fairly long-term trend, I add positions on using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points (in Trading Station) or (in MT4) The Boxed Fib Indicator (the credit goes to Hayseed for this clever indicator) set to the previous 24 bars on the 1H chart. This is all fine and well in the vast majority of instances. However, a problem develops when a particular pair is oversold/overbought, raising the specter of a squeeze as traders recognize this condition and move to close out positions to lock in profit, thus exiting the market; ordinarily, this results in short-term, counter-trend movement as the market adjusts to the exit of traders who were trading a longer-term trend. In a case where a pair is "bottoming out" or reaching a point of long-term support/resistance, it may be of value to move to a higher time frame and seek an entry there instead of merely assuming that the trend will continue in the short-term. The EUR/CAD short is an obvious example of this. In this particular screenshot, all my my entries/additions were at the then-existing .764 Fib: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For whatever reason (probably oil prices), EUR/CAD experienced quite a significant bounce. Moving to a higher time frame (Daily), you can see where the pair has been for the last twenty-four trading days and potentially see where it would have been more advantageous to either fashion an addition or initiate a position (at the .764 for a short, indicated by the red line): Attached Image (click to enlarge) In my case, this is particularly useful. I generally use the 1H chart and the 200 EMA to fashion entries, with a general rule being not to add if price breaks to the opposite side of the EMA from my trade. Zooming out to a larger time frame, however, I can potentially fashion an entry that continues to be in the direction of the larger time frame, but at a more favorable/extreme price than I would if I fashioned an entry using the 1H time frame's Fib lines.

Every so often I stumble into trades. It's like I'm walking along, and I've run into a telephone pole that I didn't notice standing there because I'm looking at my phone or doing some other distracting thing. Every so often this happens when I'm going through my daily routine, looking at the econ calendar, my charts on various time frames, and other pairs that I'm basically watching long-term, but aren't currently in the state that I would want to initiate a position in them. Ordinarily, I do this after my day job shortly after the close of the New York session, but sometimes I do it when I have a day off, the wife isn't home, and there are a minimum of distractions. I stumbled into a couple today as I was looking at my open EUR/CAD short position in the Twelver across several time frames and decided to take a couple of shorts in the 30MinZZ account in EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD based on the fact that the Boxed Fib indicator was telling me that the pairs were at or near 10-day highs: Attached Image Hoping they work out, which would be both ridiculous and welcome ... . Edit: I considered opening these in the Twelver as well, but didn't want to mess with my testing of the methodology there.

Well, sometimes you have to adapt ... . The pairs I usually like to play with in the Twelver are looking, in some cases, a bit overextended, and, moreover, the Greek issue is leading to pairs trading in extremely tight ranges in some cases, particularly Euro crosses. I can understand shooting for less than 50 pips, for example, with EUR/GBP, but don't want to do that over a bunch of Euro crosses ... . So I've decided to delete out the penders in the Twelver that are based on the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points and replaced them instead with ZigZag based entries that are somewhat far off current prices in case what comes out of the Greek/ECB/EU/IMF meetings causes a bit of a stir in the markets ... . * * * My EUR/CAD position is getting a little heavy for my comfort level, as I've already taken five legs in the thing. I'm not unduly concerned in light of my overall exposure (4:1 right now), but my net position value is currently 1.41451, more than 100 pips below the current pivot point. The fact that oil inventories came out higher than forecast today probably didn't help matters (since they pushed down oil prices a bit and therefore weakened the Loonie). The natural concern, though, is that it is a Euro cross that is currently at about 2 x equity in size and the Grexit could cause havoc with such a heavy position (or help it hit its TP, depending on what comes out of the meetings) .... .

One of the pairs I'm waiting on to "resolve itself" is EUR/JPY. Currently, the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore has painted a "3" at 136.20. Ordinarily, if I am using the ZigZag indicator for entries, I would use this "3" Semaphore as a guide in fashioning an entry (usually slightly below the "3", in the case of a short; above, in the case of a long). With this particular "3", however, I am not going to take an entry ... yet: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You'll notice on the chart that this is very last Semaphore that the indicator has painted. It is a "3" -- for now. Naturally, if price moves directly higher, the "3" may repaint at a higher level, and you could end up chasing the "3" Semaphores "up the ladder". My general pattern here is to wait for a lower Semaphore to paint after this particular Semaphore; the pictured "3" Semaphore should not repaint thereafter, but rather should be set in stone from that point forward (at least on that particular time frame).

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Well, the whole Grexit discussion between Greece, the EU, the ECB, and the IMF is messing with the way I go about things in the short term. On the other hand, Euro movement might provide some opportunities here, depending upon its depth. For example, I am not hugely into shorting EUR/USD from this level; I'd prefer some sort of substantial bounce before doing that, but am going to have to wait, probably until after the whole Greece thing is resolved to resume using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points, since they are intended to catch intraday movement within a pronounced trend, and the uncertainty about Greece means a whole lot of sideways movement in a narrow range, at least for a few more days. They're talking about "hopes for an optimal conclusion on Monday" ... .

I modified the penders, as well as the addition orders in the 30MinZZ TE. Some of them, at the moment, seem ridiculously far away from current price; however, that's what the 3-Level ZZ Semaphore is showing me at the moment on the 1H time frame. Ordinarily, I would look for entries on the 30 min., but with the Grexit discussion and/or agreement/non-agreement around the corner, I would prefer entries at greater extremes than the 30 min. will currently provide ... .

Week's Results In spite of the fact that I started out the week somewhat scatter-brained, attempting to figure out whether the Boxed Fib indicator/Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points was the thing to go with given current market conditions versus the 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator, I finally settled on setting up entries with the ZigZag, but still couldn't help tweaking the entries and exits it seemed like a million times, thus defeating one purpose of my general methodology, which is to set up the trades after the end of the New York session and then just leave them alone. If a trade opens and hits the identified TP, great; if a trade opens, but doesn't hit your TP, you just look at the chart again, see if the set-up is still good and then either wait or add. But my intention is to try to only look at the charts once a day (shortly after New York close), do what I'm going to do, and then get off and do something besides starting at the screen. The reason why I chose the ZigZag over the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points is because it appeared we were trading in somewhat tight ranges for some pairs and that attempting to use the Fib Retracement Pivot Points for such narrow ranges might cause me to get caught toward "the bottom of the totem pole," so to speak, in some trades. In fact, that is what I think happened with the EUR/CAD short trade in the Twelver. I started out using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points for the first couple of entries during an extremely tight consolidative period and winded up making entries toward the bottom of the range. Were I to have been using the ZigZag for that, I would have fashioned an entry higher up and possibly have locked in profit already. In fact, that is what happened with the Experimental TE (renamed it from "30MinZZ"). I fashioned an entry based on a "3" Semaphore more toward the top of the pair's range, and it hit its TP near the lower "3" Semaphaore: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Point in fact, I could have "double-dipped" that particular trade; you'll notice the same movement between the same approximate high and low later on ... . Overlooked it, however. In any event, I did okay for the week in terms of locking in some profit with the Twelver (in spite of my piddling around): Attached Image (click to enlarge) That being said, I fully recognize the fact that I'm in that EUR/CAD multi-leg short, as well as a couple of other trades, and that I'm currently in a 1.6% intratrade drawdown, which I'll be perfectly happy enduring assuming I can get that EUR/CAD to close early next week (I need a little more help from oil prices or a little more weakness in the Euro, please). The so-called Experimental TE got off to a late start, as I finally quit dicking around and got the thing funded: Attached Image (click to enlarge) From an equity standpoint, finished the week dead even with the so-called Experimental ... .

Are Oil Prices a "Fundamental"? Given the amount of time I spend looking at oil price news, I am beginning to think that oil prices are, in fact, a "fundamental," particularly with those currencies that are affected in some major way by oil prices like the Loonie, which I generally trade as a cross with the Euro (although I am keeping a wary eye on USD/CAD and CAD/JPY). Point in fact, oil prices and their movement are now becoming as significant to me as unemployment rates, CPI, GDP, easing/tightening, and the rest of what we generally have been led to believe are "fundamental" drivers of a currency's movement. Before the massive decline in oil prices, I barely gave oil prices any attention, choosing instead to primarily let the spot chart tell me "what was up." In any event, here is my article of interest for today on oil prices: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articl...matter-anymore The reason I find it somewhat interesting is the fact that oil traders possibly relied on such a number for informing their trading of oil futures. To me, I would think it would be common knowledge that the quality of wells in terms of per rig average production varies widely; it would make sense that producers would sideline operations for subpar performing wells. This would be like looking at the number of farmers moving out of planting corn as an informative number for corn futures when the farmers who are moving out of planting corn may not necessarily affect overall corn production if the remaining fields are or will be more productive as a whole due to weather conditions, crop yields, etc.

Getting in At Best Retracement Points Every so often, someone recommends something to me ... . Sometimes I think the light bulb goes on right away and that I have an understanding of what they're saying; and then later, the bulb actually comes on. Reading through Hayseed's thread caused a light bulb to go on regarding my trading methodology and, particularly, the points at which I enter trades, his basic recommendation being to wait until a pair experiences a 50% + retrace before entering in the direction of the prevailing trend (it's more nuanced than that, but that's the basic gist of it). Point in fact, I have not always done that; it may be impatience, a lack of time, and getting the prevailing trend stuck in my head for periods of time such that I overlook what the chart is telling me, especially on shorter time frames. What ultimately happens in those instances is that I catch a trend toward the bottom and then have to dollar cost average out of the position over time, which can be frustrating and counterproductive. The attached chart is the EUR/USD 1H chart with Hayseed's Boxed Fib Indicator set to 240 bars (which represents 10 days of data) with the 3-Level ZigZag Indicator and a few EMA's (they're not particularly important here; I use them on higher time frames to tell me trend direction). The green line to the left is the 50 line: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The Hayseed 50% retracement rule says to pick entries where there is at least a 50% retracement (obviously the greater the retracement, the merrier). In the attached example, only two "3" level Semaphore levels qualify to fashion short entries ... . If a "3" level Semaphore appears below the 50 line, don't take an entry there ... .

EUR/CAD one hour with a bunch of bad entries on retracements below the "50" line (indicated by the magenta arrows): Attached Image (click to enlarge) That trade may ultimately work itself out in my favor, but I made a lot of work for myself by not waiting to take trades at those higher "3" Level Semaphore Points ... .

GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD Countertrend Opportunities Ordinarily, I don't like to trade countertrends for obvious reasons: they have a tendency to blow up in your face. But I've been keeping an eye on GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD for quite some time now for one of those opportunities to materialize, since they frequently retrace quite wildly even when maintaining their long-term trend. On 4H+ time scales, you can clearly see how these pairs are in a rip to the bullish side. But on lower time frames, it is possible that short-term opportunities exist to short these pairs (I don't like to go long with these due to negative swap/rollover). For example, GBP/NZD appears sloppily range-bound between 2.05 and 2.08: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... and I am kicking myself somewhat for not taking a risk on shorting it from the level of that far-left "3" Semaphore; oh, well, 20-20 hindsight. I may end up setting up an entry order to do just that, but will probably go for a lot size that is 1/2 of what I ordinarily do given this pair's volatility (current 14 period Daily ATR is a hefty 275+pips). While GBP/AUD's Daily ATR is a modest 250+ pips (said sarcastically) and it is not so clearly short-term range-bound on the 1H, it may also be worth a 1/2 ordinarily traded lot size to go short around 2.00 even, although I am more hesitant about that particular trade given the possible transition the RBA may be making to lower interest rates ... .

Just so I don't space it out (as I frequently do when I get focused on other trades), I've set up an entry order for a EUR/NZD short at the .764 line for the previous 10 days of price action (which is when I might become interested in shorting the pair again): Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see price is at the bottom of the range for the previous 240 hours of price movement, which is naturally not the best place to enter short.

Progress Toward Twelver February Month-End Goal Starting/Current Balance/ROI to Date: $9835/$10266/4.38% This Month's (February) Goal (Percent): 12.0% This Month's Profit/Ending Balance Goal (Dollars): $1180/$11,015 Distance to Goal (Dollars) from Balance: $749 Next Compounding Increase (In Lots): To .05 lots Next Compounding Increase (Dollar Level): At $10,000 Balance Notes Well, the 12% goal for February started out as something of a tall order, since I started the month with an approximately $600 drawdown. Made some good progress erasing that, but the 10.9% gain is from the drawdown starting point (i.e., -$600): Attached Image In real dollar and cents terms, I've got about $750 to go if I'm going to make that 12%, but won't sweat it much if I fall short ... . Sometimes progress comes in bits and spurts and is not capable of ready prediction. I fully expect to be below that figure some months and above it in others. As far as increasing the lot size is concerned, I think I'll leave it alone for now. It seems to be a good per leg lot size (.5 x equity or below) if the progress from last month's end to date (10.9%) is any indication.

Well, I think it's been something of a weird week ... . Given the fact that a number of Euro crosses have fallen into fairly narrow trading ranges, I've returned to the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points as way of attempting to eek out a few pips while the whole Grexit thing unwinds itself. Point in fact, I was expecting greater volatility ... . We've had less, at least in Euro crosses. Given that fact and that some of my open positions were already below the .236 line using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points, I've closed those out for a few pips here and there. Suffice it to say, my GBP/USD short has yet to work out ... . That was probably an ill-advised counter-trend trade where I was attempting to catch the pair at price extremes. I have paused making additions until price breaks the 240 H EMA (I decided to start using a 240 hour EMA instead of a 200; just seems to make more sense to me than a 200 H EMA as it represents 10 days of trading data ... .) It is entirely possible that price will hit my TP before that occurs. I see some waning enthusiasm to push the pair higher on the Daily, where the CCI has just dipped below the 100 line, but it naturally could bounce around there for quite some time. The Daily RSI continues to point upward, however, and shows little sign of waning. That being said, the Daily's bearish run still remains intact, but I may have some waiting to do on that position. My enthusiasm for the Yen (more particularly EUR/JPY and USD/JPY) is waning. USD/JPY, in particular, continues to move sideways, which perhaps is the way I should trade the darn thing -- with the preference being to buy at the bottom of the range with the TP at the top ... .

Speaking of the GU short, I make it habit of going back and looking at where my trades went wrong or what I was looking at when I entered them just to see if I could have done something different or was missing something. Here's the chart, with my initial entry indicated by the magenta arrow: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Well, first of all, the trade violates one of my general rules. Go short if price is below the 240 EMA; long if above. Although I understand what I was going for here was a retracement off of established resistance, clearly I was going against the trend. If I was going to trade the pair that way (short off of resistance), I probably should have waited for the retracement to actually start to occur after price met resistance, for example, where the EMA's cross as they did before this little bull run we're seeing now. (Circled area; the EMA's pictured here are the 240, the 120, and the 24). Were I to have had a little patience, I'd still be waiting for that short opportunity; the 24 has yet to cross the 120, let alone the 240 up to this point ... .

The only thing that would have made the end of the week a little better (equity +3.8% for the week; balance +2.9% for the Twelver) was getting out of that GBP/USD short position. Oh, well. You can't have everything. Point in fact, it looks like I'll be waiting to add to that position for a little while longer. Although it does look like we may have put in a lower low and a lower high off the 1.5475 high, and the 24H EMA is headed lower with the 120 is flattening, that doesn't necessarily mean all that much when there may be some resistance at 1.5340-ish, which was just tested and has been tested repeatedly since 2/16 and held up rather nicely: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now that the Grexit can has been temporarily kicked down the road, anything is possible ... .

GBP/AUD -- Watching for a "Heel Over" I've been keeping an eye on GBP/AUD for a few weeks here, looking for a short opportunity. It has not materialized ... yet. On the 4H chart, it remains decidedly bullish: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That being said, the 4H 24 EMA has begun to "heel over" there and has begun to possibly "heel" lower. This is more obvious on the 1H time frame, where the 24 EMA has heeled over nicely, crossed the 120 EMA and begun a cross of the 240: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price is now below the 1H 240 EMA which would meet one of my criteria for a short (i.e., that price be below the 1H 240 EMA). But one of the reasons I probably won't go short yet has to do with something I haven't written about much here, and I guess I would call it "the right look." So, you ask, what is this "right look" you speak of? I am not sure it is precisely quantifiable, but I think it partly has to do with the angle with which the EMA's are ascending or descending, as well as the separation between the lower time frame EMA and the higher time frame one (and particularly the 120 as compared to the 240). The 24 is just too sensitive to be incredibly useful for entry decisions, but can alert you to a possible turn. More particularly, in a short situation (which is what I am looking for here), the lower time frame EMA will have crossed the higher time frame EMA and then move somewhat parallel with it, separated from it by some measure. You can clearly see on the 4H chart what I'm talking about were I to have been considering a long back when the 120 crossed the 240 around the end of January: there is a good upward trajectory to both the 120 and the 240, as well as separation between them ... . I'm waiting for the inverse of that to occur here, but it may naturally be a while ... . Edit: GBP/CAD exhibits similar characteristics; GBP/NZD looks to be on the verge of a break lower, it is hasn't already begun one ... .

EUR/GBP -- A Classic "Good Look" for Shorts In my last post, I indicated that one of the things I was looking for was the "right look" in setting up longs or shorts and thought I'd post some examples as I went along. EUR/GBP currently represents an ideal "look" to go short on bounces: Attached Image (click to enlarge) On this particular 1H chart, I've set up a virtual rainbow of exponential moving averages that illustrate what I'm looking for in a "classic" short: (1) easily discernible downward angle; (2) separation between and parallel movement of moving averages of differing time frames. (This is not to say that this particular set-up is going to last, particularly if we see a nasty caving of Cable strength in the next several days ... .)

USD/JPY -- Still Rangebound In contrast, we've got USD/JPY. Notice how the moving averages are intertwined and flat on the 1H. This spells rangebound in the short-term: Attached Image (click to enlarge) But just because it's rangebound doesn't mean I can't potentially trade this pair for some pips. This is where my 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore indicator comes in, which readily identifies the short-term highs and lows of the range (where the 3's appear). However, I am probably going to want to first zoom out to a higher time frame to see what the longer-term trend is, which is bullish, so if I am going to play this range, I will likely go long from a lower "3" on the notion that the bullish trend is basically intact on the longer time frame ... . For that reason, I am unlikely to short this pair from the top of the range, since we've seen the pair break higher recently ... .

EUR/USD -- Remarkably Rangebound In Spite of Grexit Drama EUR/USD is remarkably rangebound in spite of all the drama surrounding Greece: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am likely to continue to short this pair on bounces toward the top of its short-term range, which appears to be around 1.143, since on longer-term time frames, the bearish trend is intact.

GBP/USD -- Bulls Not Done Yet While I am already in a GBP/USD short position (net value 1.53701), I am not sure that the bulls are done playing with the pair yet: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Were I not to have already initiated a position, I would probably exercise caution going in long at this point. The 1H is bullish, as is the 4H, but the Daily says that the bear trend is still intact and will probably remain so (in my estimation), all the way up to 1.595-ish, which would naturally be a big move should the market push it in that direction. Moreover, the CCI is equivocal across various time frames, indicating that the pair is potentially overbought on the Daily, but ... eh ... not so much on lower time frames. This is probably why I indicated on the GBP/USD forum thread that the pair's current state is "maddening." Additionally, we're receiving horribly mixed messages from the BOE and Carney regarding the timing of an interest rate hike. This last BOE meeting, the vote was 0-0-9 for a rate increase against a backdrop of deflationary pressures mixed with favorable wage and employment data, and the Fed is spinning a cautionary tale about moving too quickly toward a rate hike; from a fundamental standpoint then, we have two Central Banks essentially on the cusp of raising interest rates, with the question being who will pull the trigger first ... .

CAD Crosses At one point in time last year, my sentiment on the Loonie was bullish. My thinking on that was that while Canada lagged its neighbor to the south in economic progress post-global financial crisis, it was basically following a modestly improving trajectory over time. Well, that was before oil prices tanked, and now my sentiment has changed, at least in the short term. Lower oil prices have naturally put some pressure on certain Canadian petroleum operations, and a shakeout of nonproductive operations has begun, some of which will fall by the wayside, after which I imagine oil prices will stabilize and/or OPEC will adjust production targets to minimize U.S. and Canadian production from some of the more expensive wells, keeping that oil out of the pipeline ... . This situation led to a surprise rate cut by the BOC and another cut is certainly not out of the question. http://business.financialpost.com/20...-says-td-bank/ Nevertheless, EUR/CAD (at least), has continued its bearish decline, so I am going to continue to short the pair at price extremes: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ordinarily, I short the pair based on the previous day's high/lo (using Fib Retracement Pivot Points), but it may be more productive to wait for 5-10 Day extremes instead, since there has been a bit of whipsawing in the pair in light of oil price changes and, of course, Grexit ... .

EUR-NZD -- At the Bottom of Its "Slow Burn"? For anyone who follows my trades, you'll know that I don't like to short the Kiwi due to negative swap/rollover. That being said, we won't find me going long NZD/USD either. So, it's EUR/NZD short for me ... . And EUR/NZD has been on a slow burn lower for the past couple of weeks, which has been nice, because that's the way I've been trading the pair. That being said, we may be near the bottom of its slow burn: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We are way off the highest high of the last ten days and more toward the bottom of the 10-Day range ... . Like EUR/CAD, it may be worth waiting a bit to take the pair on a short ride at greater price extremes, but, knowing me, I am likely to continue to short the pair from the previous day's high/low .764 line until I go blue in the face ... .

EUR/AUD, in contrast to EUR/NZD, is a bit flatter, which can be a good thing in terms of squeezing out pips from the pair: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That being said, we're in a similar situation to EUR/NZD in terms of where price is sitting "in the box" over the previous 10 days -- it's in the lower half, which may militate in favor of waiting until we get a bounce in the pair to short -- for example, at the .764 line of the 10-day high low around 1.47 even ... .

The Look of the Charts May Change After this Week's Open -- Particularly in Euro Crosses Late last week, I read a bit of "grunting" from various brokers advising traders to be prepared for gaps in light of a potential Grexit deal, uncertainty over the Grexit deal, and various other Grexit deal maneuverings by various parties involved in the whole process. This may naturally monkey with my charts and change my outlook on the week, but I think it is somewhat unlikely. Most gaps have been of a fairly mundane nature in my mind and I have, in fact, benefitted as much from them in the past as I have been "hurt" by them. And, to the extent that I've been "hurt" by them, this has been in the vast majority of the cases of a temporary nature as markets settle and buyers and sellers jockey about in early week trading ... . That being said, I can see how gaps would piss off a traditional, single entry trader who has a 5 times equity position in a pair with a SL in a potential gap area ... . This, in fact, is just another in my long list of reasons of why I don't ordinarily use hard SL's for positions, especially those that I intend to carry over a weekend; it is simply one less thing to worry about -- getting stopped out by a gap at the beginning of the trading week ... .

Enormously glad to have settled for Friday's low to get out of my GBP/USD short position ... . Now virtually every Cable cross is looking unattractive to me because I either missed the run up and don't want to get in long here or a set-up for a good short has yet to present itself in, for example, GBP/AUD, GBP/NZD, or GBP/CAD which I will wait for to heel over for a good short opportunity, but that may require some waiting ... . Cable weakness has yet to materialize ... . The possible exception is EUR/GBP, which has it's own unique way of doing things. It's not very glamorous, and you won't see a lot of movement pip wise in the pair, but it gets the job done. The Yen crosses that are ordinarily of interest to me -- EUR/JPY and USD/JPY (GBP/JPY's a bit wild), continue flat, probably waiting somewhat for Yellen ... . * * * Before I forget, one of the things I've started getting sloppy in doing is checking pair trend across multiple time frames. In Trading Station I use the 1H and 6H; in MT4, I use the 1H and the 4H. The general rule is not to take a trade in the direction of the higher time frame unless the lower time frame is in agreement with the larger one. An exception might be, however, where the 240 EMA is flat and you see that -- drilling out to the higher time frame -- a range is in play. EUR/CAD is a somewhat classic example of this, with its flat, intertwined or nearly coincident EMA's: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Where such ranges are in play, you naturally want to sell at the top of the range and buy at the bottom of it, although with EUR/CAD, my general notion is that (because it's a Euro cross), the Euro half of the equation makes it more amenable to shorting from the top of the range ... . ( Note: Since I use Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points which are based on the previous trading day's high and low and are intended to capitalize on intraday movement, I use the 1H and 4H/6H for trend confirmation. While it's perfectly fine to use higher time frames (for example, the 4H and Daily or the Daily and the Weekly), using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points will probably not work well for exit and entry points if you use those higher time frames. Although I haven't personally tested using higher time frames, you'd probably want to use the Weekly Fib Retracement Pivot Points (in Trading Station) or set the Boxed Fib indicator to a higher number of bars (for example, a week or even ten days' worth ... ) in order to take advantage of bigger movement over several days/weeks).

This month's 10-pip directional grid results on my small, FXCM Trading Station only account, most of which were in EUR/USD short: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Currently, I'm playing with the position/leg size; it is currently 3/5th's of equity, but will ramp it up, since I am likely to only trade 1-2 pairs that way ... . With EUR/USD, most of the month was occupied by the Grexit drama, so the pair traded in a fairly narrow range. Price would drop through 1-4 grid levels, leave a dangler, and then I would dollar cost average out of the dangler leg using Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points. Made for a slow go ... . Naturally, next month might be dramatically different, although the whole Grexit deal can has just been kicked down the road ... . I was hoping to use it on USD/JPY long for a bit, but the pair never rallied out of its range ... . The other obvious, strongly trending candidate for a directional grid would be EUR/GBP, but I'm expecting to see moderate retracement while Cable sorts itself out here ... .

Pair Watch for First Week of March CAD/JPY : 4H: below the 240 EMA, but "rainbow" of EMA's present flat aspect: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Bottom Line: Unattractive right now ... . Naturally, if oil prices take off from here, this could result in CAD strength and movement upward in the pair, but I'd like to see a break of the 240 EMA in that event ... . EUR/AUD : 4H: Below the 240, and, in fact, every EMA of the "rainbow". Will look to short on intraday bounces ... . EUR/CAD : 4H: Like EUR/AUD below every EMA of the "rainbow." As with CAD/JPY, however, sensitive to oil prices. Will look to short on intraday bounces. EUR/GBP : On a tear lower on the back of Euro weakness and Cable strength. Will look to short on intraday bounces with the expectation that renewed Cable weakness could cause the pair to unexpectedly strengthen (in my mind providing further opportunities to short the pair). EUR/JPY : 4H: Having broken out of a flat period, the question remains whether there will be continuation lower for the pair. The yearly low is some distance below at 130.14, so there is ample room for the pair to decay further. Will look to short on intraday bounces. EUR/NZD : The pair is on a tear lower. However, the pair is now at the yearly low, so patience may be in order to catch a retrace of greater significance than a mere intraday retrace. I'll have a look at more longer term charts at the beginning of next week's session to see what levels I might wait for. For example, 1.5130-ish would be around the .764 Fib level for the 10-day hi/lo ... . EUR/USD : Now that the pair has broken out of its "Grexit" range, I'll continue to short it on intraday bounces, keeping in mind that the yearly low isn't all that far away at 1.111-ish, so some buying interest might return there. GBP/AUD &amp; GBP/CAD : I waiting for short opportunities in both these pairs ... . They haven't materialized. The pairs are basically flat on the 4H, and I need for them to break through the 4H 240 EMA before considering a short. They've got quite a ways to go, and the 1H doesn't make it look like any kind of break lower is imminent ... . GBP/JPY : Goofing around with other trades, I unfortunately missed the obvious signs to go long with this pair around 180. I'm keeping an eye on it, but bullish continuation or a breakdown back lower will hinge on Cable strength which could continue or evaporate suddenly as the BOE dawdles with rate hikes, the Fed dawdles with rate hikes, or a combination of the two. GBP/NZD : As with the other Cable crosses, I'm looking for short opportunities now (having missed substantial runs up). As compared to GBP/AUD, GBP/NZD looks poised to break lower on the 1H. On the 4H, eh, not so much -- still flat. But the yearly low is hugely below ... . GBP/USD : Currently, between a rock and the hard place. On the Daily, the EMA's say it's still in a down trend, but with room to retrace substantially and to have that downtrend preserved intact. On the 4H, we've seen a break of the 240 EMA and quite a run upward. On the 1H, we've seen quite a retrace from the high at 1.5550-ish, as well as a brief incursion back across the 1H 240 EMA, above which it now hovers precariously. The inconsistency of price in relation to the 240 EMA tells me to keep watching, but to stay away for now. USD/CAD : This is one of those pairs that I continue to watch, but don't ordinarily trade. The run up on the back of decaying oil prices (resulting, in part, in a surprise BOC rate hike) has been dramatic, and so I'm naturally looking for some kind of collapse on improving oil prices. Naturally, I don't expect oil prices to get back to +$100/bbl. in short order; however, I would think prices ranging around between $45 and $70 wouldn't be out of the question and so it is possible that a good short opportunity with some room to run is on the horizon. It could be weeks or months away, but something to keep an eye on. USD/JPY : UJ has been basically sideways for most of the month, which made for nice range trading opportunities. However, now the pair is developing a "good look" and longs on intraday dips may become attractive: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although I have difficulty quantifying the "good look," it basically begins with the sort of multiple EMA cross we have here, followed by parallel movement of the EMA's with some discernible separation between them, and a "good angle" of the EMA's that readily show that a trend is in place. UJ has made a good start, but it remains to be seen whether it will clear that "3" ZigZag Semaphore at 119.80-ish and continue higher or merely slump back down disappointingly as it has done for the past several weeks. Summary Shorts : Will look to short EUR/AUD, EUR/CAD, EUR/GBP, and EUR/JPY on intraday bounces at the start of the trading week. Longs : Will look to long USD/JPY on intraday dips. Watching : Cable crosses beyond EUR/GBP appear problematic or poor set-ups for my methodology for the time being with inconsistency of price in relation to the 240 EMA over multiple time frames or price being on the wrong side of the EMA for short set-up's where negative swap is a concern (GBP/AUD and GBP/NZD). So, watching GBP/AUD, GBP/JPY, GBP/NZD, and GBP/USD. EUR/NZD is at or near a significant low, so I'll be watching that pair for a more opportune moment to enter short on a significant retrace (the average ZigZag retraces are: 312 pips for the 4H and a whopping 1011 for the Daily; the 10-day .764 is at 1.5131; the 20-Day .764 is at 1.55583). Additionally, I'm watching CAD/JPY for a discernible trend and consistency of price's relation to the 240 EMA on the 1H and 4H time frame, as well as USD/CAD for a potential breakdown off the recent highs, but this is not likely to come for several days, if not weeks.

This would require virtually error free decision-making processes such that I do not get caught in position from which I cannot profitably or "gracefully" exit at some point in the next nine months. Moreover, those kinds of gains would represent a 345% ROI, a patently ridiculous number for an annual ROI. Then again, knowing that there are traders around like Alirajaie (60.1% YTD) and Hayseed (108% YTD) who have been around a bit and do manage these types of returns, I have some hope that this "patently ridiculous" goal might occur ... . That being said, I do know of one error set I need to work on, and it is simply this: patience. And particularly, patience after initial entry if the trade goes somewhat awry after that point. Patience to wait to make an addition when the setup becomes good and not a candlestick before ... . Naturally, should be interesting ... .

GBP/USD -- Close to a Short After the last couple of weeks since GBP/USD made a bit of a bullish run-up, extending what has been described as a "short squeeze" (... and there was all that Carney talk about "sooner than later" interest rate increases), I've been looking to the Greenback to renew its strength when pitted against this pair. And it's almost there, at least for me. On the 1H, price has broken below the 240 EMA, but is literally sitting on top of it on the 4H: Attached Image (click to enlarge) (My general rule is to trade in the direction indicated by the 1H and 4H if there consistency in terms of price's relationship to the 240 EMA).

What I Look at For Performance: Profit Factor, Drawdown Percentage, and Win Rate Doing well, ... so far ... . I generally look at profit factor, drawdown percentage, and the win rate in looking at how I'm personally doing and when I've evaluated signal service providers or EA's in the past: Attached Image With profit factor, I regard anything greater than 2 as good; this generally means that each of your winning trades, on average, is twice as profitable as your losing ones. With me, drawdown is, to a certain extent, a matter of comfort level and risk appetite. Anything less than 10% is peachy for me, but when it gets to 20% intratrade, I start to get "itchy" (which results in my spending too much time constantly checking where my trades are at, defeating the whole purpose of spending an hour or so at New York close, looking at charts, the econ calendar, setting up the entries, and then letting the trades run undisturbed). Additionally, drawdown percentage informs me as to whether I'm trading too big and should dial it back a notch; conversely, it also informs my decision as to whether I can reasonably go bigger. Everyone likes to win, but a high win rate is not necessarily a sign of profitability; profit factor trumps win rate, since you can have a 2:1 profit factor and a 50% win rate and still be profitable.

Still watching GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD, and CAD/JPY ... . GBP/CAD and GBP/AUD are on the cusp of meeting my criteria for going short; CAD/JPY nearly meets my criteria for long ... . Prices are literally at the 4H 240 EMA for each of those. However, I don't want to get too deep into the Loonie due to CAD's being subject to fluctuations in oil prices and the direction of oil is anyone's guess (I'm thinking basically flat between $45/bbl. and $55/bbl. for WTI short-term). ... But GBP/CAD short looks attractive due to the amount of "air" below current price; I mean, just look at it: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The yearly low is at 1.778-ish (breathtaking). However, I don't anticipate a fall back to the yearly low; some of CAD's weakness is due not only to oil, but also to the surprise BOC rate cut, so CAD weakness is likely to remain in the background for quite some time.

Well, can't say I didn't tell myself so ... . I knew that GBP/NZD could be a wild ride going into it, and it has not disappointed. So, assuming that price doesn't hit my take profit by the end of the New York close, I do several things: 1. I adjust the TP to the .236 Fib for the previous 24 hours/day's hi/lo or +20 pips, whichever is greater. 2. I look at the chart across multiple time frames (usually the 1H and 4H) to see whether my set-up is still good (the short set-up's still good if the current price is below the 240 EMA on both the 1H and 4H). 3. If the set-up is still good, I fashion an entry order to add a leg to the position at the .764 Fib for the previous 24 hours/day's hi/lo (in the case of a short). If the set-up is no longer good, I wait for the set-up to become good. This may happen in a day, it may happen in a week, or it might happen in several weeks ... . 4. If the order to add executes, I then move the TP to the .236 Fib for the previous 24 hours/day's hi/o or +20 pips for the net position, whichever is greater. I would note that the 20 pips is somewhat arbitrary. However, when I have to add to a position, it's generally because I did not get in at an ideal price, and it's best to get out of the trade with a small bit of profit rather than continuing to shoot for the moon ... . I can always reload ... . The alternative is to look at the ATR or what the average retrace would be for the pair from a ZigZag turning point (I've got a script for that, courtesy of Hayseed) to guide your take profit. Currently, the average ZigZag retrace for GBP/NZD is about 230 pips on the 1H; assuming that 2.0390 is the ZZ turning point in play (it may repaint), a TP would be 2.0390-.0230=2.016 ... . My TP right now is at 2.013-ish, which is in that general vicinity ... . The current, 14 period Daily ATR is around 200 pips, so my TP as it stands right now is in the ballpark, too ... .

Sometimes dramatic wicking or whipsaws end in your favor ... . Both of these trades were set up at the previous New York close to sell at the .764 with TP's at the pair's respective .236 Fib lines for the prior trading day's hi/lo: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 75 pips in less than half an hour ... .

We're coming into the New York close here ... . Looking at my two open positions, I am reluctant to add to either. GBP/NZD has poked its ugly head above the 4H 200 EMA, which means that my short set-up is temporarily "no good." Moreover, price is currently above the .764; it could move higher, and I'd rather not add if it's going to do that: Attached Image (click to enlarge) With the EUR/NZD position, it's a lot more simple. Price is nearly the same as my initial entry, so there's no point in doubling up at this price. I will, however, go ahead and move the TP for each to their respective .236's once this hourly candle closes in about a half hour here ... .

I don't usually trade during the day, but every so often I've got a day off. Right now I've got an open short in GBP/NZD and have been watching the chart for a bit. I can see a potential news trap if we ever get back down around 2.025: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ... so I've moved my TP down slightly to potentially catch some downward movement that would result from the triggering of stops placed by the buys that entered at that point (although my guess is they've already moved their stops up somewhat).

Here are the FXCM accounts results for the week: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The smaller positions (2k) were prior to consolidating funds in the account and represented .5 times equity legs. One thing you can see there is the fact that there are some grossly bad legs in the GBP/NZD position that were over 500 pips in the red (nature of the beast), offset naturally by some really nice legs resulting in a net profitable week ... . In part, I was trying to see how long I could stand carrying the GBP/NZD short position (which was initiated several weeks ago and was larger as a whole than ordinary) because of its positive swap characteristics ... .

GBP/USD -- Here We Go ... Again After all of Carney's "sooner than later" talk the past couple of weeks, GBP/USD is back where it started on the back of renewed Greenback strength in light of favorable U.S. employment data. Generally speaking, I continue to trade the trend until there is an indication that it has exhausted or that it might exhaust. On both the Daily and 6H, we're back to fairly long-term support around the "magical" 1.50: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Prior to the bullish run-up to 1.55, various analysts were advising to sell on bounces, with one of the long-term targets being 1.38 (which is around the March 2009 low). As Carney started to blather, however, the tune changed somewhat with a number of analysts going the other way, advising to buy on dips. As the small bull run evolved, I found the set up somewhat maddening, since the Daily said "short" and lower time frames said "long" at various junctures. And now the set ups all say short both on lower and higher time frames, but for the fact that we're coming up against that 1.50 support level again. From a more fundamental standpoint, I regard the race to raise interest rates as somewhat of a dead heat between the BOE and the Fed, with the BOE having a small edge as expressed by the Carney's "itchiness" to again communicate to the market that the BOE wants to normalize rates, like, yesterday, while Janet &amp; Co. are in a "play it by ear" mode ... . At this point, the pair remains maddening for me to trade either way ... .

Euro Crosses -- Beware (or Embrace) a Repeat of Last Month's Short Squeezing With virtually every Euro cross I trade, the picture remains bearish, virtually regardless of the time frame on which I trade (1H or greater). But some caution may be in order as the Euro grinds -- although I don't know that "grinding" is accurate -- lower; I think it's more like "dropping," "plopping," or "base jumping" at this point. If you recall late in January, shorts were allegedly caught in a squeeze toward the end of the month as sellers supposedly locked in gains and then waited to reenter on a bounce, leaving late comers to the exit party holding the bag: Attached Image (click to enlarge) From my standpoint, these squeezes provide an opportunity to add to my short position; the bearish case is so overwhelming at this point that not only is the trend my friend, patience is, too. Naturally, I'm hoping for bounces this week to get in short; for most of late last week, I was unable (and didn't try) to catch the falling Euro knife, although I'm kind of pissed at myself for letting my EUR/USD directional short grid run out of levels, but I didn't think that it would break 1.17 as quickly as it did and then move some distance beyond that ... . Oh, well, can't catch every move.

GBP/NZD Short -- Did I Get In Too Soon? The one trade I am carrying over from last week is a GBP/NZD short that I initiated after price broke the 1H and 6H 240 EMA. Currently, it's nearly 200 pips in the red. During Friday's New York session, I fiddled around with the TP multiple times, questioned whether it was a good entry, and then finally moved the TP back to the Daily .764 Fib Retracement Pivot Point and threw my hands up in disgust: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is entirely possible that I got in short at a bad point in its trajectory. It may not, after all, break lower, but may, in fact, be in a protracted range or be poised to break higher. When trading pairs like GBP/NZD and GBP/JPY (both of which have been described as "widow makers"), I need to remind myself that being 200 pips in the red on the position is perfectly "normal." The pair, after all, currently has an 14 Period Daily ATR of over 200 pips and recently has been as high as 320-ish ... . If I don't like the fact that the pair could possibly move 200 pips against me in a given trading day, well, then, I shouldn't be trading it or should be trading it in smaller lot sizes to accommodate the extreme movement ... .

Well, that gosh darn GBP/NZD short isn't working well at all ... . Price has not only moved above the 1H 240 EMA, it has moved above the 4H 240 EMA. What that basically means for me is "wait" -- wait for it to at least break back below the 1H 240 EMA and -- even better -- to break back below the 4H 240 EMA. So, in this particular case, I've fashioned an entry order to sell the pair should price penetrate the 1H 240 EMA ... . Until then I wait, painful as that is in the short term. It could also be that, in spite of that trade being a dog, I can close it out some time during the month in a basket with other profitable trades ... . We'll just have to wait and see how that pans out ... . Edit: Naturally, that entry order at the 1H 240 EMA will have to be tweaked from time to time as that average changes over time ... . I probably won't come back to check on it, however, until tomorrow's New York close.

Now that the second leg of the EUR/NZD short has executed, I look at the value of the net position ... . It is 1.47429. Ordinarily my TP is the .236 Fib line for the previous trading day's hi/lo. The .236 is currently at 1.47295. I can naturally set my TP for the net position at that level, but ordinarily I look for at least 20 pips (hey, I've gone all this way; the least you can give me is 20 pips ... ). 1.47429 - .002 = 1.47229, so that is where my TP will be for the net position for the next 24 hours during which I hope price will hit that TP (fingers crossed).

How to Catch the Falling Knife -- Trade Station "Peg" Trades I usually trade on bounces or dips, but post-NFP, the Euro isn't bouncing much, if at all; it's taking a nose dive, especially in EUR/USD and EUR/GBP. This can naturally be somewhat aggravating because I'm missing the move. All is not lost, however ... . Behold! The directional "peg trade" grid! (Unveils with a flourish). I have used these at various times when I just can't seem to get the bounce/dip I'm looking for. I generally don't like to use peg trades all the time (the term "grid" generally tends to be a dirty word in trading, and I have had my share of bad experiences with them due to a lack of patience and solid rules to exit them gracefully). Naturally, the first thing to do is determine trend direction ... . Currently, with EUR/USD and EUR/GBP, this is somewhat of a no-brainer (down/bearish, right?). Secondly, (using the short scenario as an example), set up a grid below current price, taking profit for each ten pip movement the pair makes, like so: Attached Image (Note: This is just an example. I am not sure you want to necessarily set up the grid right now using these prices; this, in fact, what is left over from last night's "burn" ... .). And this is what happens when the knife is falling: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The drawback, however, is that at some point, the trend will exhaust, temporarily or otherwise (you really didn't expect that to go on forever, right?), price will hit an entry order in your grid, and then retrace, leaving you with a "dangler." I, in fact, was left with one last night in USD/JPY long: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price struck the entry order to buy at 122.00/TP 122.10 and then retraced. Oh my God, what do I do????! When I get stuck with a dangler, I pretty do as I would ordinarily do with any trade that I use the Daily Fib Retracement Lines for entries and exits. At New York close, I look to see whether the trend is still intact; if it is, I will fashion an entry order to buy UJ should price strike the .236 Fib line for the previous day's high/lo. If that order executes, I then revise the TP for the net position to the nearest profitable 10 pip grid level and, if space permits and I still think the trend still has some legs in it, fashion entry orders above the net position TP to continue to take advantage of the movement ... . Unfortunately, MT4 does not allow this type of set-up ... .

Just an FYI: the average ZigZag leg length on the 1H for EUR/USD is 111 pips; 245 on the 4H; and 632 on the Daily, so a 100-200 pip correctional bounce would not be out of the question. Remarkably, the next immediately higher Level 3 ZigZag Semaphore is at 1.126 or so on the 4H; the next immediately higher one on the 1H is around 1.1388 ... so ... wow. I assume that the development of a short squeeze would likely occur toward the end of the month, as traders square up and lock in gains, but as I posted previously, I'm not seeing signs of bullish divergence yet on the Daily, so it looks like most are choosing to continue to hold short and not exiting their positions ... yet ... .

Week's Peg Trade Results (Trade Station) Barring EUR/USD driving dramatically further down, here are the week's results for the "peg" trades: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notes A dangler was caught in USD/JPY, which was averaged out of using one or more buys at the .236 levels for a couple of days' previous hi/lo's. After the net U/J position hit its TP, the remainder of its peg trades were deleted out due to signs of a lack of bullish continuation. There are current danglers pending in EUR/GBP and EUR/USD which will be addressed next week by averaging out via sells at the .764 levels. EUR/GBP and EUR/USD short peg grids remain in place down to about 100 pips from current price. The 900 pips (which primarily represents peg trades in EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and USD/JPY) compares with approximately 620 pips for the week in the Twelver TE. The Twelver, in comparison, capitalizes on intraday bounces and dips, and has focused primarily on shorting Euro crosses, many of which did not bounce appreciably this week.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Week's "Twelver" Results In spite of being unable to catch any significant Euro cross bounces this week, the manual trades went modestly well: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The exception to that was probably an ill-advised GBP/NZD short, which turned out to be far too wild for my tastes. I will not be venturing into that pair again soon. Stats also remain generally good, with an inception-to-date profit factor of 5.19, and an 83.9% win rate: Attached Image

EA Being Coded for Manual Methodology After manually running this method for quite a period of time (several months with live funds on a small Trade Station account, a few months on a demo MT4, and now a few more weeks with live funds on an Oanda account), I figured I'd quit screwing around and have an EA coded that implements the rules of the manual system outlined here. I think that this is also a good exercise in establishing set, mechanical rules for entry and exits that are designed to take a large part of the emotion out of the trading process; the more "machine-like" you are with your entries, exits, and the like, the less likely you are to get emotionally involved in what occurs with those trades ("Hey, this is what my trading plan told me to do ... ."). The basic "buy" rules (the sell rules are the converse of the buy rules) communicated to the coder are as follows: (1) Initial Entry Parameters: At New York close, the EA fashions a good for day entry order for the pair to which the EA is attached to buy at the .236 Fib for the previous trading day's hi/lo if current price &gt; 1H 240 Period EMA and the 4H 240 Period EMA with a TP at the .764 Fib for the previous trading day's hi/lo. (2) Parameters for Movement of TP Where Initial Entry Order Executes, But Does Not Hit Original TP Prior to New York Close. If the initial entry order executes, but price does not strike the TP prior to the New York close, the EA moves the TP to the greater of (a) new day's .764 Fib for the previous trading day's hi/lo or (b) +20 pips. (3) Parameters for Additions to Initial Entry Where Initial Entry Order Executes, But Price Does Not Strike the TP Prior to the New York close. At New York close, the EA fashions a good for day entry order to add a leg to the position if the criteria for initial entry in (1) are met, with the TP being equal to the TP set by the EA in (2). (4) Parameters for Movement of TP If the "Addition to Initial Entry" Entry Order Executes. If the "Addition to Initial Entry" Entry Order executes, the EA moves the TP to the greater of (a) the new day's .764 Fib for the previous trading day's hi/lo; or (b) +20 pips for the net position . (5) Repetition of Additional Entry Orders Until TP is Struck. Legs will be added in a fashion similar to that described in (3), with the TP being moved in a fashion similar to that described in (4) up to a maximum of four additions (resulting in a total of five legs), after which the entire, net position will have to be disposed of manually. I have given some consideration to whether I will have code written to dispose of positions that run out to five legs before the described TP is hit (hey, it happens every so often, but most of the time it is because I mishandled additions) in order to allow the EA to run on full auto. In all likelihood, I will probably have this coded as an "option," since I want to test how many times the system's trades will be placed in this predicament. Moreover, I don't have good rules in place for how to dispose of positions with five legs (initial entry + four additions), so it might be worth, at the very least, thinking about, with the the likely rule being as follows: (x) Disposing of Position Where an Initial Entry and Four Additions to Position Have Been Made, But Price Has Yet to Strike TP. If the EA has already made an initial entry plus four additions, subsequent additions will be made follows: At New York close, the EA will fashion a good for day entry order meeting the additional entry execution and TP parameters, but with lot sizes to be calculated as follows: net position size/4, rounded up to the nearest microlot. Example: The EA has made an initial entry of 1 lot and four additions, each of which are 1 lot in size, for a total of 5 lots. The fifth addition will be 5 lots divided by four, which equals 1.25 lots. Should a sixth addition be necessary, at which point the total number of lots currently devoted to the position is 6.25 lots, the size of the position will be 6.25 divided by four, which equals 1.57 lots (1.5625, rounded up to the nearest microlot is 1.57). And so on and so forth ... . (You can kind of see the problem with setting things up this way ... . It's not pure martingaling, but the position is getting larger and larger in its effort to get the price of the net position closer to current price and to exit the position net profitable ... ). (6) Stop Loss Parameters/Options. Traditionally, I have used no stop losses with this methodology. However, I have nevertheless requested that the coder set up options to allow for the use of fixed, dynamic, trailing, and ATR-based stop losses should someone want to use those. I'll post the finished EA here if at all possible and probably set up a TE to test it on a demo before using it with live funds. Could be a great time saver ... .

Got the bounces I wanted ... in spades. Lol. The only position that I'm modestly concerned about is the EUR/GBP short, which has now broken the 1H 240 EMA. In all likelihood, I'll hit the pause button on adding to that position until post-FOMC, which is no doubt the reason we've had so much sideways action in some pairs in the past few days. A long position in USD/JPY, for example, has been particularly unproductive, with the pair being locked in a particularly narrow range. Point in fact, I'm not really hot on going long at this level, even on an intraday basis. The Yen can be particularly amenable to risk-on/risk-off environments, which can quickly cave a long-term trend. Moreover, the Daily shows the pair very near the December 2014 high, from which it retreated temporarily all the back to 115 1/2: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In my mind, it could virtually retreat all the back to the Daily 240 EMA (currently at 111.711) and still maintain its long-term bullish trend. So, for me at least, I'm going to exercise a bit of patience here and look for it to make deeper dips than it's been doing on an intraday basis to get in long. I'm not sure what I'll use to fashion those entry orders; the selection is somewhat limitless -- one or more of the "rainbow" EMA's; a longer-term .236 in the Fib box (e.g., 24 days ), or 3-Level ZigZag Sempahores ... .

Sooo, what's up? Looks like we're experiencing a bit of a dollar correction here. In a matter of hours, the entire trade picture has changed with what was short appearing long, and what was long appearing short ... . Stop losses are popping all over the place ... in EUR/USD, USD/JPY, you name it ... . Me personally, these kinds of things are to be expected. From time to time, I'm going to endure an intratrade drawdown. This is naturally bigger than I'd like, but I just need to be patient, let things settle, and then go from there. In all likelihood, I don't imagine I'll be making any additions to my positions at New York close. Nearly everything (with the possible exception of EUR/NZD; noble little kiwi), has broken the 240 EMA to the high side, a signal that I should wait, let things settle, and, most importantly, wait for a resumption of the trend. Naturally, this bites, because I'm stuck in trades, and all I see is red. I prefer to be in and out in3-5 days; this could drag on a bit as the market digests the FOMC statement and buyers of the Greenback weigh back in when price tells them it's favorable to do so ... . That being said, I don't think that anything in the FOMC statement today changes the background fundamentals of Fed tightening ... . I am not sure what the market was exactly expecting, but to me the statement is firmly in line with what was expected. It's always been a "play it by ear" sort of enterprise. Moreover, on time frames higher than the 1H, the EUR/USD bear trend, for example, remains intact; so does the USD/JPY bull trend ... . Additionally, I need to tell myself that moves in response to major statements are often overdone and impulsive, leading to retracement soon thereafter. With EUR/USD, for example, you could literally hear the SL's at 1.1 "pop" when price hit that level. Price drove briefly higher, only to retreat as sellers (probably both live and automated) waded back in ... .

Decided to not open up positions in any other pairs until I get one or more of the current open positions closed, so I deleted out that EUR/NZD short. Just makes more sense to deal with what's on my plate at the moment ... . Naturally, if I get things whittled down to one "dog" trade, I might venture back out into the water ... . A 7%+ drawdown is plenty for me with 6:1 exposure ... . Moreover, always have to keep in mind whether you anticipate adding to a position, and I do -- most likely to the EUR/USD short ... . The other pairs are not that far away from their respective TP's in the scheme of things ... .

EUR/USD -- One Day's Movement Does Not a Trend Make I have read quite a bit over the course of the day, as well as various comments from traders that this bounce in EUR/USD and/or weakening in the dollar marks a sea change in trend direction; in other words, that we should all pile into EUR/USD long, that parity is now off the table, etc., etc. In other words, their feeling is that the whole landscape has changed as a result of a single day's price action. However, in the grand scheme of things, the fundamentals for continuing to short EUR/USD remain, at least for me: the Fed is going to tighten, and the ECB has just begun easing and will be easing for several years to come. While the Fed rise may not be on the pace that everyone anticipated (frankly, I don't know what folks were anticipating; Janet has always said, "We'll see how it goes."), it will occur. And ECB easing will continue. Nothing fundamental has changed, but for the pace of interest rate rises (I naturally know that this is no small thing ... ). If one drills out to larger time frames, one can see today's move in context, namely that it is but one candle in a protracted down trend, and can only, at this moment in time, be considered a "correction" (didn't you think, after all, that the fall from 1.1 was a bit overdone, hasty, impulsive?: 4H: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Weekly: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You'll notice one thing on each of these, longer time frame charts: price has yet to break the 240 EMA on either the 4H, the Daily, or the Weekly. (I know most folks use a 200 period MA; it is unlikely have broken that on any of these time frames either). So before everyone goes out and jumps into EUR/USD long at this point, take a deep breath, take a break, and let the market digest this particular event for a few days. The pair's character will come into clearer focus in a bit. Until then -- if you have doubts about the direction of this pair's trend, stay out of trading the pair. Sometimes doubt is there for a reason ... .

What a difference a day makes -- in part ... . Still have three trades left over after yesterday's excitement -- a EUR/AUD short, a EUR/USD short, and a EUR/GBP short. In the short term, I'll be adding to the EUR/AUD and EUR/GBP shorts should price strike the .764 Fib for the previous trading day's high/lo. I have not entered an addition for EUR/USD due to the fact that the Fib "box" for the previous trading day currently encompasses a huge range, and I don't think price will strike the .764 of yesterday's hi/lo in short order, so I'm probably just going to let it settle over the weekend and then go from there. You'll notice in the Twelver some entry orders that are far away from current price; these are based on 75% of the average retracement experienced by the pair over the immediately preceding Zigs and Zags added to the price at the nearest ZigZag 3-Level ZigZag Semaphore immediately below current price on the Daily chart ... . After yesterday's shenanigans, my concern is that the Euro may be in consolidation across several crosses and that we could see bounces of several hundred pips before they resume downward trends, in which case the better short play is from higher and not here ... . Naturally, I'll play it by ear ... . Moreover, we're getting toward the end of the month here, which I'd naturally like to exit flat if at all possible. Price is unlikely to hit anything but the nearby entry orders, which I hope will allow me to exit the remaining positions in short order (fingers crossed). Edit: Some of you may be wondering why all my trades didn't get stopped out at a loss during yesterday's price action. The answer is simple -- no stop losses ... .

It is looking like the month is going to end in lackluster fashion with the Twelver (which is looking more like a "Sixer"). While I am stuck for a bit in a EUR/AUD, EUR/USD and EUR/GBP shorts waiting for post-FOMC jitters to settle (and for these respective pairs to sort themselves out), I will in all likelihood (re)turn my attention to non-USD crosses, since these pairs appear to have been somewhat less impacted ... . While some might say my being stuck in these trades is "unfortunate," I regard the recent correction in the Greenback as a blessing ... . I do look, after all, to trade trending pairs, taking advantage of bounces and dips. Without bounces or dips, I generally do not make pips, unless I know I am trading a rangebound pair and can take advantage of that range in the short-term (which I am also perfectly fine with). Every so often, I naturally get caught in corrections such as that being experienced now, and all I can do with the open positions is wait, be patient, try not to sweat it too much, and have some confidence that my grasp of the "bigger picture" is correct ... . The other thing is that I generally anticipate having to add up to four positions after initial entry (for a total of five legs); we're not there yet with these trades, with EUR/USD having two legs, EUR/GBP, three, and EUR/AUD, two. The EUR/AUD may hit its modest TP without my having to do anything (it's 79 pips away from it now). The EUR/GBP is 120 odd pips away from its TP, but that's fairly large for that particular pair (the Daily 14 Period ATR is currently 76 pips, but it wandered around a lot between 40 and 60 for several months, which is fairly tame ... .). The EUR/USD short's a bit concerning since (like a doof), I took two of the legs in fairly close proximity to one another; the current average net position price is 1.06083; and the current price is over 200 pips above that. Naturally, we'll see what next week brings ... . I would be amazed if EUR/USD resumes its downward trend with enough speed to get me flat for the month, but weirder stuff has happened ... .

GBP/USD -- A Few WTF Daily Candles I have been watching GBP/USD for quite a bit now after bailing from a short around 1.535 at the end of February (which I naturally regret, but Carney's attempting to talk up the currency left me glad to bail at that point). With the Fed's raising rates off the burner for some time (the consensus is September at this point, but a lot can happen between now and then), I think some attention should be turned to whether now, in fact, the BOE will raise rates before the Fed (they're awfully anxious to do so, if Carney's talk is any indication; but the vote is still 0-0-9). So, at some point I want to go long Cable (technically, I am already long Cable with that EUR/GBP short). However, the last six Daily candles leave me saying "WTF?!": Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy? Sell? Will the market make up its f'in mind? That being said, I generally don't trade based on candles alone. I trade based on price's relationship to moving averages, more particularly to the 4H 240 Period EMA and the 1H 240 Period EMA, and neither of these say the bear trend is over yet, although those last six candles do show some hesitancy to break 1.474-ish ... .

The Week Ahead -- Looking Beyond Euro Crosses So, every so often I get caught in trades, and I get caught in trades that are focused on one particular currency, in this case, the Euro. Sometimes, you just can't help yourself; the Euro downtrend has been so prolonged and evident that you keep on trading Euro crosses until ... well ... , you're caught. I used to make a concerted effort not to bunch up my trades in a single currency, attempting to spread risk across several, and avoiding more than two positions open at one time in a single currency; well, I guess I got lazy. Which just goes to show that your trading plan should include a physical checklist that you go over at the beginning of the week or the trading day that you physically go over one point at a time, so that you don't let your laziness take advantage of you ... . With that goal in mind (i.e., not bunching up my trades all in just one or a couple of currencies), I'm turning my attention to non-Euro crosses to see if there's something out there I can trade while I wait for the Euro to resolve itself, and a few come to mind: AUD/CAD and AUD/JPY Long Range Plays Looks like it's ranging in the short term, so the play would be to go long from the previous day's hi/lo .236 Fib line, targeting the .736: Attached Image (click to enlarge) (AUD/JPY's is quite similar). AUD/NZD Trend Short Sometimes while I'm fiddling around with other trades, I miss out on profound trends that I could've easily taken advantage of -- AUD/NZD short is one that I may have missed a good deal of the move on, but it is still bearish on virtually every time frame: Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP/CAD Trend Short Although I'm somewhat leery of going Cable short (it's entirely possible that the BOE will beat the Fed in the interest rate raising rates, who knows ... ), GBP/CAD is short-term trending short, primarily on the back of Cable weakness: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Moreover, the other half of the equation -- the Loonie, pivots on oil price movement. Although I am hardly the one to look to for advice as where oil goes from here, we're near a short-term bottom in WTI (if industry could ever stop stockpiling and reduce its inventories, we's see a good bounce in price, and therefore Loonie strength ... .) http://www.dailyfx.com/crude-oil On the other hand, we recently experienced a surprise BOC rate cut motivated, in part, by the collapse in oil prices ... . Kind of a toss-up, although there is huge air between current price and the January low, making the pair attractive from that perspective ... . NZD/CAD and NZD/JPY Longs (Possibly Transitioning from Range to Bullish Trend) Another couple of pairs to which I've been devoting little attention: Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZD/JPY's trajectory is somewhat flatter, at least pre-FOMC, but still probably worth a long play ... . Others I Thought About But Will Probably Pass On CAD/JPY: Short-term, the charts say sideways/rangebound. The problem is that the range is particularly sloppy, making an entry at extremes problematic. However, if I were going to opt for a trade, it would either be a short from around 96 with a TP around 94.5: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is entirely possible, moreover, that this could be a good dynamic trade opportunity (both long and short from range extremes) if oil prices would ever settle into some kind of range ... . GBP/NZD: People have said that GBP/JPY is the widow-maker ... . They are wrong; GBP/NZD is. Huge moves ... . A roller coaster ride that most of the time you do not want to be on; even assuming you've basically picked the correct direction, the moves while you are in the trade can be disconcerting, to say the least. Everything says short-term short, but I still think the thing is in a monstrous range and we are toward the bottom of it: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The best plays on this pair are to wait until the roller coaster is at the top of its trajectory ... .

The Peg Trade Account Unfortunately, my peg trades came to an abrupt halt as EUR/USD and EUR/GBP bottomed out and USD/JPY topped out pre-FOMC, leaving me with some danglers that require disposal. I managed to dispose of the USD/JPY dangler via dollar cost averaging, but am waiting for the Euro to settle before addressing the EUR/USD and EUR/GBP dangler's in earnest and then will look at whether it is worthwhile to continue to run peg trades for just those pairs, keeping the depth of the peg trade grid particularly narrow (100 pips or less) while the implications of FOMC full sink in. Quite frankly, it is quite rewarding to just focus on a small number of pairs for your trades and not dabble in a bunch of crosses to squeeze out pips on a regular basis. Quite frankly, I don't know what the ROI MTD is at this point, since I moved funds from the MT4 account to this account after the beginning of the month and subsequently increased the lot sizes as a function of equity (generally, .5 x equity): Attached Image (click to enlarge) That bumpy mess at the beginning involved a couple of trades carried over from last month ... . That being said, I think it's worthwhile to maintain a couple of different accounts to take advantage of varying market conditions. The FXCM peg trade account generally looks to capitalize on falling knives, although it's sometimes hard to tell where the tip of the knife will be ... .

Going to stand aside from adding to EUR/USD and EUR/GBP short positions for now. Naturally, the message being sent by price action post-FOMC is equivocal at the point: price is above the 1H 240 EMA (indicating bullish), but below the 4H EMA (indicating bearish). The EUR/AUD short appears range-bound, so I will fashion an entry order to short that pair if price strikes the previous .764 of the previous trading day's high/lo. If that order executes, I will revise the TP for the net position to the .236 or 20 pips, whichever is greater ... .

Note to Self: Don't Let Douchebags Get Into Your Head Okay, so I tend to read a lot of news, and I tend to read a lot of people's comments about that news (I don't know why I bother, some of it is just plain ass stupidity when it comes down to it). Some of the news you read (currency forecasts, trade suggestions, and such), unfortunately, gets stuck in your head. For instance, EUR/USD parity gets stuck in your head, regardless of whether you think there is evidence to support that particular target. You can't help it; you've read so much about parity that you trade the pair as though 1.0 was a legitimate, advisable take profit somewhere down the road. Additionally, particularly in venues like these, you'll get folks (well-intentioned or otherwise), who inject their opinion into your trade ideas, leaving you in doubt as to whether your idea is valid (in spite of the fact that it is, given what you know and the particular way you trade). When that happens, return to your charts, trade your plan, and push what all the douchebags (well, they're not all douchebags) have to say aside ... . What the chart says, rules ... . All the other stuff is just noise ... .

Borrowing a bit from Hayseed's playbook.

This is the reason for so many entries in these areas. Naturally, they appear grid-like in nature, but they are in specific areas of the 10-day range ... . I figured this was better than merely targeting "a level" for this time frame since you will naturally have movement about in this area ... .

I can't believe that I am almost flat for the month ... . Still got some work to do on that EUR/GBP short ... . Unfortunately, I handled that EUR/USD short rather sloppily, getting into a couple of entries toward the bottom of the 10-day range because I just wanted to "keep on trading." Naturally, this happens from time to time, but I should have been more attentive to the trend's temporary exhaustion (via a Daily indicator like RSI or CCI). Also, I should have just used plain common sense and stayed out of the market pre-FOMC ... ). Ultimately, what I ended up doing is dollar cost averaging out of the position with .01 microlots between the 240 H/10-day high lo .5 and 10-day high lines, but I made a lot of work for myself and limited my profitability by not being patient and waiting to take entries above the 10-day .5 line: Attached Image (click to enlarge) (An alternative method is to fashion entries down from the 240 EMA (in the case of a short), which would have also avoided my making entries too far down into the "dip").

Equidistant vs. Parabolic Scale-In And yet another thing I've been playing with ... . If you like to scale into positions in small increments like I do (especially with pairs that exhibit wicky characteristics around S/R), you'll know that the most common way of doing this is examining S/R and then fashioning several entry orders around the desired entry point to accommodate the inevitable sloppiness around S/R. They can be 10, 20, 50 or 100 pips apart, depending on the volatility of the pair. However, this may not be the best way to scale in, so I've been playing with slightly "parabolic" entries that get incrementally tighter at or near the desired entry point. Traditional scale-in with equal lot sizes spaced 20 pips apart and a hypothetical short entry around 1.0000: entries at .90600, 90800, 1.0000, 1.0020, 1.0040 Parabolic scale-in with equal lot sizes spaced diminishingly apart and a hypothetical short entry around 1.0000: entries at .90600, .90750 (15 pips away from immediately lower entry), .90990 (14 pips away from lower entry), .1.0012 (13 pips away from lower entry), 1.0024 (12 pips away from lower entry), etc. Scaling in parabolically as opposed to linearly results in a better average price for the scaled in position ... .

The number represents the movement of a large number of various microlot (.01 lot) entries in EUR/USD short over the past several days/couple of weeks.

EUR/AUD -- What I'm Waiting For One of my favorite pairs to short is EUR/AUD, not only due to its long-term rangeyness, but also to its favorable swap characteristics. Recently, however, I've been standing aside from the pair, waiting for it to hit price extremes or to turn lower, something it has not done in recent weeks as a result of underlying Greenback weakness and a bit of Euro correction from the mid-March lows. Posted here, the Daily chart with the 60-day range for the pair and the 14 Period CCI, indicating overbought conditions: Attached Image (click to enlarge) From a practical perspective, I am looking to make small entries anywhere above the .50 line (which is slightly above now) all the way to the 60-day high, but would prefer entries above the .618, targeting the .236 for the net position. I could naturally start doing that now, but the reason I'm holding off is this -- Monday's RBA rate decision: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pundits have indicated that a rate cut is potentially in the cards, which could send the Aussie dramatically lower (and EUR/AUD higher) ... . Naturally, if the RBA holds off with a cut until its next meeting, we could see Aussie strength, which would send EUR/AUD lower. I would prefer not being in the middle of that .... . And because the Kiwi generally experiences some sympathetic movement with the Aussie during such announcements, I am likely to stay out of the Kiwi until the market digests the rate decision announcement, too ... .

Right now, it looks like EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and EUR/JPY may be developing ceilings and floors that I can trade as ranges, but I think it also might be far too early to tell whether this is going to be a lasting, tradeable pattern unless it is to merely trade from the most clearly defined level, which would be from the cleaner "ceiling": Attached Image (click to enlarge) "Cleaner" isn't saying much, because the data points for my current ceiling in EUR/JPY (EUR/USD and EUR/GBP have similar trajectories), for example, consist of (1) the impulsive post-FOMC spike and (2) Friday' lackluster NFP data. I'm hesitant to count the impulsive post-FOMC spike as a ceiling ... . By the same token, that's where price action indicated where selling interest was ... .

A Slight Tweak I've always said that whatever your trading plan is, trade your plan, tweak your plan, trade your plan ... . Well, you get the idea. So, in my boredom, I've tweaked my plan a little bit. Whereas I used to just fashion a single entry order at either the .764 or the .236 depending on whether I was going long or short in a pair, I've decided to "shotgun" entries at or above the .764 (for shorts) and below the .236 (for longs), taking a bunch of smaller entries between the .764 and the previous day's high (or the .236 and the previous day's low). Price doesn't inevitably just stop at the .764 or the .236 and reverse; it slops about a touch, and it's probably worth spitting out a few entries in the general vicinity of those levels to catch overreaching or overenthusiastic price movement rather than going for a "one shot, one kill." Perhaps I'll catch a few extra pips that way ... .

"Fibbing Out" The Last Swing Once I've identified what appears to be a trend (I play ranges differently), I've started to "fib out" the last swing to determine where my entry points will be. In essence, they will be a bunch of small entries in appropriate increments between the .50 line and the 1.0 line (how big your increments are will depend on how much room there is between the .50 line and the 1.0; I want to keep the total number of entries in that area to 1 x equity or less, at least initially). Here's the EUR/USD 4H with Hayseed's Boxed Fib Indicator on the right hand side (you can naturally just manually "fib out" that last swing): Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the pair moves lower, I will gradually peel off bits of the position, but leave a few winning legs on ... . In this particular case, I've got a couple of TP's set up for now to peel stuff off, but I may change them later if there appears that continuation will be in my favor. At this moment in time, I'm only setting up entries between the .50 and the 1.0 for that last swing; once a new swing develops (hopefully, lower), I'll fib out that swing and then fashion new entries between that new swing's .50 and 1.0 ... and then add to what I already have ... . Naturally, waiting to add to a winning position requires some patience, because you will want to hold the winning position open, wait for a retrace, and then add to the winner as the longer-term trend resumes ... . I generally like to be in and out of trades in short order, but this might be a welcome and more profitable change of pace. They say that the greatest shortcoming of many traders is that they cut winners off too soon ... . I assume that you can also hold winners too long ... .

It makes it seem like there are a heckuvalot of entries, but I don't know at this point how deep a retrace might be in the end. The notion is that I want to catch at least some of a retrace back through the swing's .50 line, like so: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I may not catch all of the entry orders between the .50 and 1.0, but then again, I don't really want to ... .

For the first time in eons, I have actually set a stop for the net value of my EUR/USD entries, plus 20 pips: Attached Image I generally do not like to set hard stops; my personal philosophy is that in many instances hard stops actually create loss by exiting positions that, in the longer run, are likely to be productive given longer-term trends that are in place (and, given my particular methodology, are likely to work into a productive scenario ... eventually ). (Moreover, there is a certain psychology present when a position stops out; although I don't have any studies handy to demonstrate this, my experience is that there is a certain reluctance to return to a pair or set-up if one is "burned" and stopped out, even though a re-attempt at the set-up could result in profit.) In this particular case, though, my intent is to add to that winning position should I get a retrace and with the value of the net position between .764 and the 1.0 line, I'm more than comfortable with doing that here ... : Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The fortunate thing -- I've only got 30 odd microlots of exposure sitting out there which limits the sticker shock ... . That being said, I welcome bounces, even though they're temporarily disconcerting ... . I'm going to temporarily return to 1/5th equity legs until I purge those Greenback crosses from the mix (USD/CAD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD), all of which have been affected by the DXY break and 1/10th equity legs for the particularly volatile Cable crosses (GBP/NZD, GBP/AUD, and GBP/JPY; they have a tendency to scare the crap out of me).

U.K. May 7th Elections: May Be Time to Start Easing Out of Cable Crosses Although I'm going to be playing Cable crosses pretty much through the end of the month, I've decided to not be in them any later than the monthly close. Most of the time, I just play through major events; half the time, it seems, that works for me, and half the time, it doesn't. And when it doesn't work, it sometimes takes me several days, if not weeks to get out of a position that I held through a major economic event (case in point, the last FOMC: I was in EUR/USD and EUR/GBP short, and it took several weeks to get out of both net profitable ... ). My feeling is that, as with the Scottish independence election, there could be counter-trend Cable movement (i.e., bullish movement), just because folks are bailing out of, for example, GBP/USD shorts due to fear as to how the elections might affect Cable value one way or the other and want to lock in gains before that occurs. The alternative is to (a) scalp through the elections (which I don't really I have the time to do); or (b) wait for the elections to finish and then work the price action appropriately thereafter (which is probably what I'll do).

Dollar and Cents Drawdowns vs. Drawdowns in Relative Terms When I first started out trading lot sizes that were basically equal to 1/2 equity for each leg of my entries, I thought 12% per month was not undoable given my experience using this methodology over several months in demos and lives with smaller leg sizes (1/5th times equity), which generally yielded something around 6-9% per month. Once you actually get down to doing it with larger lot sizes (and so, inevitably, larger intratrade drawdowns), well ... there's the rub. Here's what happens psychologically when I get into larger drawdowns using these larger lot sizes: basically, I stop trading new pairs, focusing on the trades in drawdown to resolve themselves before opening new positions. This can take several days or several weeks. Naturally, as a result of this, I miss opportunities in other pairs that I could have taken while waiting. There are good things and bad things about doing things this way: the bad is that you miss opportunities to profit in other pairs; the good is that you avoid the possibility of taking on new "dogs" that you will, in turn, have to wait to resolve themselves. How many "dogs" do you want to tolerate in your portfolio at one moment in time? I haven't discovered a precise number I'm comfortable with myself, but given the limited number of total pairs that I generally consider trading on a day-in day-out basis, it is unlikely to be more than a couple ... . (Having said that, I notice I've got at least one "big dog" in my TE right now (USD/CAD long), and a couple others that could quickly attain "dog status" in short order ... .) I do know the ideal number: 0 . The other, more important psychological phenomenon that occurs as your balance increases and you therefore increase lot sizes is concern over the actual dollar and cents size of the drawdown even though, in relative terms (i.e., the percentage of drawdown), the drawdown really isn't any bigger than usual relative to your balance. Consider the extreme example of the trader with the $1 million balance. A 1% drawdown (pretty modest by most assessments) for that particular trader would be an actual dollar and cents drawdown of $10,000. Relative terms: small drawdown. Actual terms: huge chunk of change (at least from where I'm sitting now ... ). Adjusting to larger dollar and cents drawdowns that are nevertheless in line with previous experience in purely relative terms will take time ... .

The DXY -- Worth Keeping an Eye On as Part of Your "Trading Plan"? After yesterday's sudden, Asian session dollar slide attributed to the DXY's breaking support, I happened across one trader remarking that they check DXY on a daily basis as part of their trading plan. I have never done that, thinking that the pairs I trade will "speak for themselves" via their individual charts. If you're not familiar with DXY, here is what the "Dollar Index" is made up of: It is a weighted geometric mean of the dollar's value relative to other select currencies: Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight Japanese yen (JPY) 13.6% weight Pound sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight Canadian dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight Swedish krona (SEK), 4.2% weight Swiss franc (CHF) 3.6% weight http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index , and is traded as a future or ETF. There are also other, "Dollar Index" funds or ETF products about, but you get the general picture; it's a basket of USD cross currencies and can be examined to gauge dollar strength, weakness, momentum, support, etc. It's probably worth at least a glance to see if the dollar is coming up against support/resistance: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see we've had a couple days' worth of dollar weakness here ... . And may be in for more before all is said and done ... . Could give us, for example, a nice bounce in EUR/USD to take advantage of ... .

FXCM Weekly Results Here's the FXCM account weekly results ... . The equity curve looks whacky, but the ROI is what's important. The balance at the start of the week was $15,068; at the end of the week $15,520, so about 3% for the week: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've been focusing primarily on just three pairs in the FXCM just to simplify my life: EUR/GBP and EUR/USD short; USD/JPY long (although I did work in a few other pairs at the end of the week out of boredom, frankly). YTD, the return is about the same as the "Twelver" TE -- 27.58% (although I added funds to the account somewhere in there, which confuses matters): Attached Image (click to enlarge) In any event, I continue to not use SL's in the vast majority of cases, except where a fairly hefty profit is present that I want to protect (a rare occurrence, to be frank; I generally don't remain in trades long enough for there to be huge pippage at risk). I continue to find the results somewhat baffling, since all the self-education I did primarily talks about risk-reward ratios and the setting of SL's ... . Risk-reward considerations are really not part of this methodology; if I had to consider them for each leg of my positions, I would go totally bonkers and never make a trade. As far as SL's are concerned, I have a contrarian view regarding them along the lines of Joseph Nemeth who calls them total "bullshit." Well, I wouldn't go that far; I just think they get in the way of this particular type of methodology which is similar to Nemeth's in many respects (although, for some reason, he's attracted to the 20 period EMA which I find to be so sensitive as to be virtually useless except on time frames Daily and above). In any event, not going to fix something that, as far as I can tell, ain't broken ... .

And Now ... A Word About Moving Averages If you've done any reading about which indicators you should use to trade, you've probably already know that some folks love them, some folks hate them. "Laggards," the critics say. "The only 'indicator' you should be using is price action, because price action doesn't lie ... ." Well, the critics of lagging indicators are correct: they do lag. So, then, what good are they? For me, a person who generally only uses moving averages (which also lag), they do one important thing, and that is provide me with a quick, visual cue as to the general state of affairs with a given pair. If a particular EMA is flat, the pair is ranging; if it is angling down, the pair is in a down trend; angling up, in an up trend. (I say, "general," because moving averages really tell me nothing about support and resistance, which is, in fact, a matter of pure price action). For others, they can provide a purely objective basis on which to fashion rules for entries and exits that should be part of your trading plan. For example, James Stanley (part of the DailyFx ed team), has the most simple chart set up I've ever seen with the simplest trading rules you could imagine. He uses the 5 min. and 1H chart with an 8 Period EMA and a 34 Period EMA. He may slap on some horizontal lines for clearly evident support and resistance, but that's about it. His rules (if I recall them correctly): (1) if price is above the 1H 34 Period EMA, and (2) the 5 Min. 8 Period EMA is above the 5 Min. 34 Period EMA, then (2) look to make long entries upon price's touching the 5 Min. 8 Period EMA, moving the SL up to break even ASAP, adding to/peeling off from the position and movement of the SL if there is continuation. Pretty objective stuff ... .

Currently, I'm waiting to add legs to my USD/CAD long, USD/JPY long, GBP/USD short ... . Well, you get the picture ... . Dollar weakness last week caused most of the Greenback crosses to break to the opposite side of the 1H 240 Period EMA from my trade direction which basically means, "Wait to add." It's the nature of the beast and probably the feature of this methodology that requires the most patience; you're in the red on the position and you want to add to it to move the net position value closer to current price, but the rules say to wait ... . Waiting hasn't always been my strong suit ... .

WTI Eyes Resistance -- Rejection May Trigger CAD Weakness I don't trade oil directly, but I frequently look at oil for its potential effect on one of the forex currencies I do trade -- the Loonie. WTI is currently flirting with a resistance level that, in my mind, is likely to provide a short-term barrier to further oil price increases: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The run-up to this level against a backdrop of continuing increases in U.S. oil stockpiles and possible easing of sanctions against Iran (all of which should depress prices) is probably the result of overblown speculation regarding the effect that instability in Yemen will have on oil transportation/production, http://www.ibtimes.com/how-instabili...-trade-1790068 and is likely to be fleeting once the size and capabilities of the Houthi rebel fighters is understood -- small and only effective as compared to the even more ineffectual ousted Yemeni regime defenders; more importantly: a force unlikely to be capable of both holding its ground and simultaneously blockading or otherwise restricting the transport of oil through the what is likely to be a heavily defended Bab el-Mandeb strait. In a nutshell, my supposition is that oil will fall away from this resistance area (between current prices and $60, where there is quite a bit of noise if the price action in mid- to late December is any indication), buoying CAD and other petro-economy currencies in short order.

Peg Trades -- How Deep to Go As with the Oanda account, I got caught somewhat (but to a lesser degree) in last week's dollar weakness in my Trading Station account. Most of my Trading Station mess has been cleaned up, since I primarily use the TS account to focus on trades that MT4 can't do (such as peg trades) or to just trade three or fewer pairs with low volatility/reasonable ATR to keep things simple and to minimize the fraying to my nerves (lately, it's just been EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and USD/JPY). Naturally, every so often the peg trades come to a standstill due to a lack of continuation or the set up in the direction of the recently predominant trend doesn't look enticing (bottoming/topping out, stalled at support/resistance). When I first started doing a few peg trades just as a no brainer way of catching a few pips in an intraday trend that was consistent with longer time frame movement (I kind of look at peg trades as a form of scalping), I was sloppy with my consideration of where to truncate the grid. For example, with EUR/USD, one could very well go ahead and set up their peg trade grid all the way down to parity and then walk away if that is the way they think it's going to go, but I'm more of a short-term guy ... . Consequently, I look for any short peg trade grid I set up to stop short of the previous day's low, obvious support, or a reasonable ATR; sometimes, just a couple 10 pip levels will do ... . If price blows through your grid and leaves you with no danglers (the ideal situation), you've done it perfectly ... .

Well, first a bout of USD weakness; now a bout of Cable strength has me continuing to wait to add legs to my GBP/USD and GBP/JPY shorts and to my USD/CAD long (I am not overly concerned about the EUR/JPY short). Patience here is key; there is little sense in adding legs at this juncture merely for the purpose of drawing break even nearer to current price if (in the case of Cable), it is going to continue to move up or (in the case of USD/CAD), it is going to continue to move down ... . Naturally, some traders don't like the notion of doing this (i.e., adding to a losing position), but that is the very essence of this methodology: adding to the position as the pair returns to the direction of the initial entry or falls into a range that can be worked to obtain an average for the net position that is favorable to a profitable exit, or -- at the very least -- a less unfavorable exit. I could exit these positions at losses or allow them to stop out, but that is not what the methodology is about; it's about working positions through the somewhat cyclical nature of the market ... . I'm not merely waiting for a loser to "come back" all by its lonesome; I'm there to guide it and help it on its way. Most of the time, this takes longer than I'd like, but the market isn't there to suit my wants or needs; it does what it's gonna do ... . But most importantly, the current TE is part of a lengthy test (not always a well-managed one because I've got a human running it) -- a test to see whether traders like Joseph Nemeth who use similar methodologies and claim to be millionaires after abandoning single entry, risk-reward ratio-based trading -- are full of crap or not. Having it work well and compare favorably with or do better than single entry methodologies over three months, six months, or even a year is great, but if it totally implodes after that ... .

Trading Station's Weekly Results Here's the Trading Station/FXCM account's weekly results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The TS account differs quite a bit from the Twelver, as I generally only trade three pairs in that account -- EUR/USD and EUR/GBP short, and USD/JPY long. This makes for a simpler situation generally than what is present in the Twelver, where I basically go for everything that meets my basic criteria. Every so often, I add a trade or two in different pairs just to keep myself engaged in that account. Nevertheless, that account is also in a drawdown, albeit smaller than in the Twelver because, like in the Twelver, I decided to go short GBP/JPY, pretty much right before there was the pop in Cable, but there are only three pairs with open positions there: EUR/USD short, USD/JPY long, and GBP/JPY short (a EUR/GBP short hit its modest profit target ... .)

Competing Methodologies/Time Frames for EA So, as I am going through having the EA coded, I have two, competing methodologies in mind; they're basically the same in principal, but use different time frames as the basis for the entries. The first methodology is described at length in this thread, and involves taking trades based on price's relationship to the 1H 240 EMA and the same 4H EMA and using the Daily Fib Retracement Pivot Points as the basis for entry exit. The strategy is intended to take advantage of intraday movement, and the EA currently being coded is basically set up to use this methodology ... . The second, inspired somewhat by the manner in which I've seen Hayseed trade (although it probably does not mimic his trading in every respect ... ), involves looking at higher time frames to inform trade direction (he uses PSAR) and then taking a series of small gridded trades in the direction of the trend suggested by the higher time frames in the area between the .50 and the 1.0 Fibs for the previous 10 days' high/low and/or a percentage of the average value of the ZigZag retrace (50% of that value and above) (I have tended to just use the Fib lines; taking the average value of a ZigZag (which would represent the average retrace) and then calculating where your entries should lie takes more time; I imagine he's got a script/indicator for that ... ). It's basically a mean reversion strategy ... . The TP can be a particular Fib level, a ZigZag semaphore, the weekly low ... . Both have their drawbacks and merits. The short-term time frame strategy capitalizes on short-term movement and, if you're correct with trend direction, you're generally rewarded in short order. The drawback is shown in my current TE; if you continuously trade in the direction of the trend, eventually the trend bottoms out, corrects, and then you are left with entries toward an end of a longer-term range ... . Naturally, you could probably program this fact into the EA, telling it not to make entries toward either extreme of the 10-day range ... . The other strategy capitalizes on fairly long-term (10-day) price extremes, so you're frequently required to wait for a set up and then a number of good set-ups occur at the same time in crosses of a single currency; it would be a perfect job for an EA -- waiting around. By the same token, you're looking to actually get greater pippage out of the set up, because you are, after all, looking at a 10-day range. You can also work the total position like a millipede, peel off little pieces of the entries as price moves into profit a little bit more easily than with the short-term methodology, or add to a winning position. Unfortunately, with the number of working parts that the methodology has, any EA that would implement it would necessarily be more complex, using PSAR, the 10-day high/low Fibs and/or the value of the average ZigZag retrace, and a grid set-up for the "target area" in which that smaller entries would be made ... .

The forecast is for a return to "sucky." -- Wednesday's FOMC Statement.

This is an area that has disappointed in the past few weeks, with data printing in a slightly upward trajectory from the April 2nd print. Q1 data has traditional "blown", so it's the subsequent quarters that should show improvement if Q1 is an aberration ... . If Q2-4 data do not show improvement and demonstrate that Q1 was "spot on," we're not only in for a bout of Greenback weakness (it's here, to a certain degree already), but a delay in the timing of the Fed rate hike. -- All Week Long: Grexit.

What Went Wrong -- Well, the Entire Market Did As you can see by my TE, I'm in somewhat of a world of hurt ... . Looking at the charts of the pairs I most commonly trade, it appears that I'm looking at things upside down, as virtually every pair has both broken the 1H 240 EMA and the 4H 240 EMA ... . Ordinarily, this would signal me to go long on these pairs ... but (there's always a but ... ) the longer-term trends still remain largely intact. For example, EUR/USD (when you zoom out to the Daily), is still in a protracted downtrend: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For me to change my fundamental view of the trend direction for EUR/USD, I would require a break of the Daily 240 EMA (which now lies at 1.2034), and I don't see that happening in short order. That being said, I did play no small part in jacking up my trades by getting a little bit frisky and impatient with additions right before FOMC minutes, changing from the manner in which I trade using the previous trading day's high/lo and corresponding Fib lines and violating my rules to wait to add to positions until the trend in the direction of the trade resumes. As they say, plan your trades and trade your plan (and don't change your plan in the middle of holding positions). My standing aside, being patient, and waiting would have gone a long way toward my not increasing my exposure and drawdown. The other thing I got lazy about was "shotgunning" a bunch of entries for a bunch of different pairs, many of which were correlated. I used to actually make an effort to not do that, looking primarily to go flat every Friday or, at the very least, at the end of the month by having positions open in only noncorrelated pairs -- for example, EUR/USD, CAD/JPY, and GBP/AUD, just to throw a grouping out there; no currency is represented twice, although some of the currencies might very well have more subtle correlations out there (I generally don't delve deeper into currency correlation; there are tables where you can see the relationships between, for example, the Euro and the Pound, but if I had to make my trading choices based on that, I'd probably go bonkers ... ). Actually making an effort to do this naturally limits the number of positions in pairs you can have open, as the number of nonrepetitive combinations is quite limited when you get down to it. I won't trade CHF, Yuan or any emerging market currency, so my possible currencies are limited to the Euro, Cable, the Greenback, the Aussie, the Kiwi, the Loonie, and the Yen, and I currently only want to go long Aussie and Kiwi (due to swap) (even more limiting). The other thing I pointed out to someone who PM'd me to basically say, "WTF ... . Your risk management blows ... . Your last three months of gains just went down the crapper in the matter of a few days ... " is that this particular TE represents part of a lengthy test of Joe Nemeth's basic methodology. I have tweaked it to my liking, but I basically have the same basic parameters in play (point in fact, I doubt that he is the "inventor" of this methodology, but he's put a few videos out there and developed a software package that uses it, so he's the guy that I'm familiar with ... ). In any event, the only "risk management" there is to the system is lot/position size. Generally, stops are not utilized; risk/reward ratio is not a consideration; and you basically never exit a trade unless the entire position is net positive. Naturally, I'm skeptical of whether such a methodology can work in the long run, but it would've helped if I'd just stuck the rules (the worse thing is being unable to help yourself ... ). Now it's kind of an f'd up test because I injected my impatience into the thing ... . And, sure, it looks bad now, but the losses aren't really losses until you actually close those positions out (but, point taken, the drawdown is way bigger than I want to experience .... ). In any event, my positive take away from this drawdown is this: I'm in a big drawdown, and in spite of the fact that I made a bunch of stupid additions that violated the rules, I didn't panic and close everything out in a fit ... . Weird as it sounds, that's kind of a milestone for me ... .

GBP/USD, however, has broken the 1H 240 Period EMA, as has USD/CAD, which is encouraging, but none of the Euro crosses appear to be headed back toward their respective 1H 240 EMA's, let alone their 4H's ... . Point in fact, Cable crosses appear to be in a more interesting state for bears, probably in part because Cable holders are likely dumping their pounds over uncertainty surrounding the upcoming election, now but a few days away ... . At any rate, who knows what next week will bring with the possibility that dollar bulls start to consider whether DXY or USDOLLAR have bottomed out and if this is a good juncture at which to reenter US dollar long ... . The former appears to be dawdling at support; the latter appears to have bounced off ... . My opinion is that USDOLLAR is more representative of dollar strength than DXY, which is heavily weighted toward EUR/USD (&gt;50%); in comparison, USDOLLAR gives equal weight to EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, and AUD/USD. That being said, my feeling is that DXY is the preferred go-to for the measurement of dollar strength ... . On the Trading Station account side of things, it was a pretty good month there, with my largely standing aside from last week's market turmoil in anticipation of peeling off a small piece of that account to run the EA on: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Is Greenback Strength Returning? ... Too Early to Tell Well, I've been absolutely brutalized over the past few weeks if my TE is any indication (it is), primarily on the back of Greenback weakness, which began to seep into the market the last week of April where DXY broke support at 97.00 and trundled dramatically downward on to 94.00 on lackluster Q1 U.S. data (no surprise, really; it is historically the worst quarter for U.S. data due to a wide variety of factors, mostly weather-related). That being said, we've had a few good U.S. data points this week, which has pushed DXY back up a bit to 97.25: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not exactly on a tear ... . Aside from a couple of positive to mixed U.S. data prints, we've had an interesting mix of events that have moved the markets, not the least of which is the U.K. elections, which have injected an added degree of uncertainty into the Euro, since P.M. Cameron, in the first two minutes of his victory speech, reiterated the fact that he will put the issue of the U.K.'s EU membership to a referendum in about two years' time. It will naturally be interesting to see whether Cable will be able to hang on to its post-election gains against the various uncertainties the membership referendum injects into the equation, as it not only would affect the EU economically, but also the U.K. (I was listening to a National Public Radio report indicating that the questionable continued presence of the U.K. in the Union would almost have an immediate adverse economic impact on the U.K., with companies intending to do business to EU specs passing on building or expanding there since Cameron has stated his repeated dissatisfaction with having to comply with EU requirements and burdens). In sum, it is hard to measure the level of excitement the market has for continued Greenback strength, at least in the short term. The consensus among pundits, after all, is that the Fed has kicked the interest rate hike down the road until at least September. These couple of positive prints (really, the NFP was mixed: back over 200,000, but less than forecast; decline in unemployment rate, but a downward revision to last month's numbers) are unlikely to put June on the table for a hike again, so buying interest in the Greenback may not materialize until more positive data points emerge, making a September hike more certain.

What I'll Do While Waiting for Longer Term Positions to Resolve Themselves -- Why, Scalp, Of Course I'm not a huge fan of scalping, because, well, I'm not a huge fan of staring at the computer screen waiting for "the set up." Moreover, I still have a day job, which kind of limits me to trading Sydney and early Tokyo, which can be godawfully slow ... . Nevertheless, I will scalp on occasion, but when I do, I generally don't like to settle for ten pips; I like to go for continuation ... . My basic set-up follows DailyFx's James Stanley's: an 8 EMA and a 34 EMA. That's it. I may draw some horizontal support and resistance lines on just to assist me visually, especially those that might not be apparent on lower time frames. First, start with the 1H chart. What you're looking for is a cross of the 8 and 34 EMA's, which will show you the direction of the trend. You don't want to dive in immediately; you want to wait for the trend to develop, most likely over several hours' time. Naturally, you can stare at the chart for the entirety of those several hours, but it makes far more sense just to note that a cross may be developing and then check the hourly chart at the top of the hour to see if it's going anywhere: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've noted the 8/34 EMA crosses with up/down arrows ... . Although trading is closed for the week, you can see that a bullish cross may be on the verge of developing, which might make for a scalping opportunity come next week's open (hard to tell; there is China data coming out over the the weekend, which may cause a gap up/down in AU). More often than not, I log on in the evening to find the trend is well underway. Where that is the case, I drill down to the 5 min., looking to enter a trade in the direction of the 1H trend and the presence of a similar "look" on the 5 min. as there is on the 1H, namely that an 8/34 EMA cross has occurred in the direction of the 1H trend; some separation has occurred between the 8 and 34, indicating that there is some momentum to the movement; and that there is a "good angle" to the movement. Entries are to be made upon price's touch or penetration of the 8 EMA. Drilling down to the 5 min. AU chart, you can see why you might not want to scalp the pair until direction is confirmed on the 1H: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The pair is basically short-term sideways, with the EMA's crossing back and forth ... . Not an ideal set-up ... . But there have been plenty of opportunities in the past several days which have presented better 5 min. looks in keeping with the 1H trend: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Once you're in the trade, the idea is to move your SL to BE as soon as possible, peeling off pieces of the initial entry as price moves in your favor, adding to the position upon successive touches of the 8 EMA (assuming the trend is sustained) once the position is soundly in the money (e.g., 20 + pips from BE is a good rule of thumb; anything else is probably too close to be worthwhile ... ); adjusting the SL to BE or BE + for the net position and so on ... .

The Alternative to Scalping for Continuation: Scalping Levels (AUD/USD) Unfortunately, you're not always going to get continuation with your scalps. Sometimes, the pair is just rangebound in the short-term, with traders pushing a pair back and forth between the previous Day's hi/lo or the previous trading session's hi/lo. There are pips to be made there, they're just -- in all likelihood -- going to be smaller, and you'll just have to take what you can get and move on. Fortunately, basic price action and obvious support/resistance levels can assist you as to when to take a scalp. Here is the AUD/USD 15 min., with Fib lines for the previous day's hi/lo, as well as a couple of levels off of which price has reacted: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Right now (pre-market open), I would be looking to go long upon price's reaction off of some of these levels. That being said, I would also watch for the pair's ability to break through the level at which it is currently (.7935), as this level provided a bid of modest resistance in Friday's session (although we did see an impulsive break of the level, after which a sell-off occurred, driving the pair back to .78840, at which time buying interest rapidly reappeared ... ). There was a bit of China data in the off session (lower CPI and news of lower interest rates), which may produce a gap up in the pair due to further signals of easing by the Chinese government, so this whole picture might change in short order ... . Naturally, you'll want to also look for breakout opportunities one way or the other, depending on how the pair moves at Asian session open in reaction to the off session news, looking for continuation in the direction of the movement if it plays that way, as well as scalps that play the fade as enthusiasm for the movement peters out ... . The other high impact news that might wiggle the pair about is the NAB figure, for which I have yet to see a forecast (the April number was a "3", up from March's "0").

NZD/USD Scalping Levels As with AUD/USD, there may be some market open movement due to Chinese announcements occurring during market close, so naturally this set-up may totally go out the window once we can gauge how the market is going to react to the announcement of a rate cut ... . In the short-term, the pair appears to be hesitant to break lower than .74217 or break higher than the .75 psych level, so naturally these will be areas of interest to watch for price's reaction to these levels: Attached Image (click to enlarge) There also appears to be an area of modest buying interest around .7462 which provided a touch of resistance on Friday (before buying interest gave way, allowing the pair to slide to .7420-ish, a level which it tested repeatedly, and finally broke, after which substantial buying interest reappeared .7410-ish, driving the pair all the way to .75).

USD/JPY -- Poised to Break Lower To me, the pair appears to be poised to break lower, having completed an 8/34 EMA cross on the 15 min., after which it traded on the lower side of Friday's "0" line: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Moreover, a good continuation set-up may be in the making, as the pair is on the verge of an 8/34 EMA cross on the 1H. I'll be looking to scalp UJ as a "fingertrap" setup, shorting on touches of the 8 EMA on the 5 min., particularly if the pair shows a willingness to break that 119.579 level that showed a bit of buying interest in Friday's session. The Chinese news/data may provide a touch of strength to the Yen, adding to Yen crosses' slide ... .

You may want to consider scalping AUD, NZD, and JPY crosses other than Greenback crosses. I'm just going for those particular scalps due to spread and the fact that I set fairly tight SL's when scalping. Other crosses (like EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD, etc.), tend to be more whipsaw and will take out a tight SL in short order even where you've got the direction of the trade correct ... .

I agree ... . Daily = sideways, like, since the beginning of the year (snore). Hate to trade it on a longer-term basis (unless it's like a range-bound play); on a short-term basis, could be worth a small number of pips ... . It's like the last on my list of things to scalp; on the other hand, seems to respect the Fib and psych levels ... . The ATR looks like it's around 75 pips for the entire trading day -- doesn't exactly get my motor running.
