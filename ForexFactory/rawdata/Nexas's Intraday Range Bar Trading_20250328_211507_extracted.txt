Hello Fellow Traders, I know many of you have been trying to make sense out of this trading lark for quite a long time but can never seem to make the breakthrough. There may be many reasons for this and I am not going to attempt to explain them all in this post, but what I am going to do is give you all a system that I use quite successfully to extract profits from the markets. Now this system is not going to be a silver bullet or your magic beans, it is simply an approach to making money from the markets, and still requires a little effort and discipline from yourside. What it is however is relatively simple and easy to follow, and it is also a system that goes someway to eliminating much of the noise typically found on intraday charts. OK so to the system. The Charts I use range charts which are price based charts as oppose to our normal time based or volume based. I am not going to give an in depth overview of range charts here but if you are interested and want to know more please do a google search where you will find many articles about range charts. Now with regards to charting platforms, I use Ninja Trader which provide range charts as standard, but if you are a metatrader user I believe you can get indicators that do the same job or similar. I use two different ranges, the 4 and the 8 with 3 moving averages as can be seen below. 4 Range --&gt; 20 EMA, 60 EMA, 100 EMA 8 Range --&gt; 20 EMA, 60 EMA, 100 EMA I use the 4 for fast moving markets where I can see a clear direction, however if this starts to get a little noisy I then move up to the 8. I hope you are all following so far. The Pair I solely trade the EURUSD as far as currency pairs go (I also trade the eminis). The reason for this is the cost of doing business is so much cheaper on this pair as well as the fact that when you are intraday trading you need to remain focused, and I don't believe you can do that by trading hundreds of different pairs. You end up always missing the move. Plus you get more than enough opportunities trading the EURUSD without having to watch other pairs. The System Ultimately this is a swing trading system. We are simply trading the pull backs during a trend. So the first thing we need to do is define a trend. Now I know we can do that looking for higher highs and higher lows in and uptrend and the opposite in a downtrend but as we are so close to the price I like to have a little more confirmation. This is where the MA's come into play. If the 20 is above the 60 and the 60 above the 100 then we are only looking for longs. If the 20 is below the 60 and the 60 below the 100 then we are only looking for shorts. Clear enough so far? Now for the pullback (or congestion), we need to see momentum in the price so as well as the MA's we also need to see the price clearly moving and not just chugging along slowly in anyone direction. Once we have this momentum we then look for the candles to start to pull back, we need a minimum of 4 candles pullback, this means we cannot enter before the 5th candle opens at a bare minimum. Now once we have the pullback (you can use trendlines to contain the price if you like) you wait for the candle to tick through the trend line, this is usually the open of the next bar unless it is a little more noisy in which case you may need price to move further. On the break you enter your position and you place your stop behind the most recent swing. You target is roughly where the previous upswing was in an uptrend and down swing in a downtrend. When I say roughly, of course you want to make a good risk reward, so you need to try and run your trades for as long as you can, although this is a feeling thing more than anything. You watch to see how price reacts when it gets to its first road block. Risk You can have many trades in a day so to protect yourself, you need to think about an overall daily stop loss. That is the max you are willing to lose in a day and then divide it into 6 at least. This will allow you to make a few losing trades in a row and still be in the game to profit when the markests move. Ok that is enough from me for now. I will update with some screen shots and other thoughts and insights later. I have just given you the bones, which once you have read through it a few times should seem quite logical. As we progress I will give you more about actually trading it as well as results as I trade etc. Until next time Nexas

This morning has yielded 6 trades and 6 winners. However please note that this morning has been a very good one and is not always the way. For example friday it took me 3 losing trades before I hit the winners. The key is dicipline, patience and confidence!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Nexas, Thank you for your method and explanation. Could you please show screen shot of this morning with your trades, please? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Certainly... Here they are... One was taken on the 8 range and the others on the 4. There is also one going at the moment on the 8 range which I have not marked but hopefully you can see it.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This morning has been quite amazing! 7 from 7. You really can't complain when you get runs like this. However as I said before this is not something that will happen everyday which is why one need to be consistent in their approach and efficient with their entries and exits, else you would miss a morning like this!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
By the way, you are going to need a broker/spreadbetting company with low spreads for this type of trading. 1pip on the Euro is really the max, otherwise you are paying too much in the way of costs and your R and R will get skewed the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
ok nexas. i will follow this one as iam a longer term trader myself. can you give chart examples of when and why you would use a 4 range instead of an 8 range ? any idea how to put range bars on alpari ? never used range bars before.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Nexas, Thanks for sharing your method. I also use range bar charts and have a similar concept of trend and method of entries. Anyway, I would like to wish you great success with your thread and trading. I'll definitely follow your thread. Csabi

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks nexas for the info, keep posting your trades. can some one post the mt4 range bar indi here..

--- 帖子 #10 ---
forgot to ask, what time frame is best suited to this system ?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
nexas...thanks for the overview..it makes a lot of sense..I use Ninja alos and have bben trading range bars for well over 3 years now..appreciate the set-ups ..thanks and continued success in your trading..I have a tweek or 2 to present but will do that as this thread develops out of respect to you..I am not intrested in "stealing" a fellow traders thunder...thanks again

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Whatfx, Are you talking about Metatrader? You will need an indicator for that. I don't have one myself as I use Ninjatrader, but I know you can get them. Some you have to pay for. The is no timeframe. That is the point, it is price based as opposed to time based. In the trades above you see towards the end the 4 range chart started to look messy so I moved to the 8 range for more clarity, Nexas

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks Csabi, please feel free to join in...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Rebel, Unfortunately I don't have an indicator as I use Ninjatrader, but I know you can get them. Nexas

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Kipr, Please feel free to contribute as you see fit. I am not worried about my thunder or any of that. Truth be told, it gets a little boring sat in front of the screens all of the time so I thought I'd entertain myself by helping people to trade. So if you have anything that can help others please feel free to add. Nexas

--- 帖子 #16 ---
well you strategy seem to be good well i wish you make a video tutorial on and then exlplain and give some live results of the trade

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Waheed, When I have a little time I will produce a video, but I don't really have any spare time at the moment to do that. With regards to live results, that is what I posted yesterday and will continue to do so as the thread progresses. Or did you have something else in mind? Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #18 ---
i wanted to talk you personally in instant messages service because i have some question about the trade About the video let`s saturday is coming so i`ll wait for that one and see how you provide demanded stuff i have also checked all posts but did not find that thing

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Waheed, Thank you for your reply. I think you are misunderstanding me. I am not going to do it this Saturday, I am going to do it when I have some free time but I don't know when that will be. What are you looking for in the posts? Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi All, I hope you are having a good time with this system. Another good day yesterday and this morning has also been good after an initial tough start. There doesn't seem to be much activity here... does anyone have any questions? Nexas

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Nexas, Can you post some examples? How you manage your trades?, (stops , targets, etc)

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Jordi, Yes I will. What I am going to do first for everyone though is to post some results. I am going to present you with the back tested results which will show you what you achieve if you manage to remain disciplined. I won't show you my results first of all as they will not be the same as the backtested ones as first of all I trade a few different systems so you won't get a true indication of what is possible here, but two even I make silly mistakes sometimes and hence some of the results either better or worse will not be a true reflection of the system. I can tell you that I am profitable trading this system and you will see this as I continue to post results, but for this early exercise I want you all to have some accurate statistics from which you can all work from. I will try to do this over the weekend and get it out by next week at some point. How does this sound for everyone? Nexas

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Nexas Sounds good. I am interested in range bars so look forward to it. Thanks. Mark

--- 帖子 #24 ---
ok Nexas, I'm very interested with your risk management

--- 帖子 #25 ---
For those using metatrader, the indicator I attached will create a range bar chart. You need to place it your metatrader/experts folder and drag onto a 1m chart. You can set the bar range parameter to whatever size range bar you need. Make sure you open the offline chart once you done the above to see the range bars.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
@Zpiders... Thank you very much for that contribution! Much Appreciated. @Jordi... no problem, I can tell you that my average win us about 1.5-2 times large than my average loss.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi, Here are some more examples. This is this mornings trading. I actually missed the first entry, although it was a valid one, but managed to jump on to the second. On both you would enter on a break of the trend line with your stop below the low as indicated by the arrows. The reason I didn't take the the last one on the chart is that the previous move only really slightly broke the previous high and then retraced the whole previous move. So that indicated weakness more than strength to me. Plus the fact that this mornings trading had been super slow and sluggish, I thought it best to bank profits and come back this afternoon. Nexas

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Ok Nexas, so I understand that when you have a clear entry and stop, then, to find the target, you multiply the size of stoploss by 1,5 or 2. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Another thing...thread subscribed

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Jordi, No sorry it is not simply a multiplication. I place my stops behind the last swing point and I try to place my targets a pip or two before the nearest support or resistance. It just so happens that the majority of the time this gives me a positive risk reward ratio and if it doesn't I will either pass on it or I will exit when I get an opposite candle close. Thanks for subscribing :-) Nexas

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Nexas..you have a solid strategy..nice work..as an idea for a "confirmation' trigger..and this can be used on the 4 rg or the 8rg..approach....I use a 2rg chart..and add to that chart a Williams %R..14 period....and then change the parameters to 80%"overbought" on top of subpanel..and 20% "oversold" on bottom of subpanel..(note: the Williams %R is inverted..20-ontop-80-on bottom) so I changed that to standardize how most traders use oscillators..When you see the pullback(of at least 4bar) per Nexas's instructions..Drop to a 2rg chart..and when you get the "extreme condition" of above 80 for sell..or below 20..for the buy on the Williams %R..that will help the trader "isolate' the appropriate bar to trade..I almost always use sellstop or buystops to enter trade..Hope this is not too confusing..but you will find it to be quite effective to " dial in' the better entry....Nexas again you have a very good strategy for several reasons with the obvious reason that you are truely trading with trend and can avoid the chop that is the traders nightmare..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
as mentioned in last post..I want to further clarify..again I use the 2rg to find the "trigger" for entry..I use nexas's trendline also as a guide..and with the Williams %R 14 period..I add a"constant line" indicator for further help in entry..as noted previous.. we set an 80 and a 20 line on Williams Indi..that lets me know "get ready" when those lines are penetrated..but i have also added with the "constant line" indicator a 98%line and a 2% line ..so when the Williams %R goes past 80(for sell) I am " on call' for entry..and when the Williams %R line goes past 98% I look to sellstop that 2rg bar for the sell entry..and vice versa for the buy entry..The reason I put the 98 and 2 constant line on the Williams sub panel is to "visually" make me aware that we are at the extreme of the pullback..and be ready to pull the trigger..Used appropriately with Nexas's "mini-trendline" makes for some very exacting enrties..and risk control is part of that factor...Again Nexas ..thanks for your posts

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Kipr, during this month I have trying to learn how to scalp the markets. I've opened a ninjatrader account (only for data), for this reason I found this thread very interesting. After I read your post I 've deduced that you are a scalper, isn't it? If so, can you explain how to manage your trades? I'm refering to stops, targets, money management, etc because I think that this is the most dificult part if someone wish to be a profitable scalper

--- 帖子 #33 ---
trade management and how to trail and risk control is a personal issue..as each trader has a different approach..there is no 1 way ..but as for me personally I am a "scalp" and run type trader....I typically trade at least 2 contracts..I take 1 off @ 5ticks profit and reduce my risk to 4 ticks behind my entry ..that way if I get stopped its a break even trade..I never want to turn a winner into a loser..my intitial or "catastrophic stop" is placed below or above the pivot closest to where I enter..but generally not to exceed 12 ticks..as if that is the req'd stop then i will pass on that trade..once i am in a runner..I try to keep stop around 5 ticks behind the price action..and manually trail..usually i will look to take the trade off if I have a solid divergence ..or at least tighten the noose..i never really have a target on the runner..and will continue to move the stop as the price action makes new highs/lows in that cycle.If I trade 3 contracts..I leave 2 as runners..If I trade 4 contracts i take off 2 and leave 2 as runners..usually the reward to risk ratio works out to be more than 1:1..but that is not set in concrete..also I try to avoid times of day that are historically choppy.. hope that quick overview helps

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks Kipr, next week I'm going to papertrading nexa's system with your suggestions . By another hand, I've attached "constant lines" to my chart, but nothing is drawn.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Kipr, Thank you very much for your input. I hope the readers of this thread find it useful! @Jordi - I hope you have found some good information here and wish you luck for your paper trading next week. Remember this is a great system but takes discipline, when you are trading so close to the price if things start to go wrong it can quickly snowball and any mistakes you make you can quickly compound on. So don't try to chase trades or make back losses to quickly, simply take a step back, reassess and trade from there. Nexas

--- 帖子 #36 ---
what time frame are you using ?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
whatfx There is no time frame. That's the point of this thread. The chart is based on range bars. Hope it helps. Mark

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Yup indeed, there is no time frame. We are trading price and only the price. So when the market goes range bound, less bars are printed hence you are kept out of SOME of the chop.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
there has been some'confusion' on how to set the "constant lines" indicator in the same sub-panel..as the Williams %R..that I mentioned in an earlier thread..lets assume the Williams%R is in sub-panel 2..since the Williams is shown in negative #'s..we want the Williams to show -80 and -20..so when we add the Constant lines' overlayed on that same sub-panel..we want "under parametes..Value line 1 to be set @ -98..and value of line 2 to be set @ -2....make sure under the "visual" section you have that shown as panel 2 and in "scale justification" set that to 'overlay..hit apply and ok and you should see the lines appear ....this is for Ninjatrader

--- 帖子 #40 ---
i`m really facing to find ninja trader can you pm or give me link to down lad i really looking for this software

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Nexas, can you upload more charts with your entries?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi waheedpcc, simple google: http://www.ninjatrader.com/

--- 帖子 #43 ---
yes i also want to learn it more closely as i have said to nexas that please make a tutorial but yet he does not do that, so at least he should upate us on every day so we can learn better

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi All, No problem I will upload some charts later on. I am in the middle of the session at the moment so it is difficult but I will do it a little later. @Waheed, I am not sure if you mean to be but you are coming across quite demanding and aggressive. Please remember I am showing you this our of kindness and I am not selling you anything, hence this experience has to be enjoyable for me and if all I am going to do is get demands made on me as if you have paid me for a service then I will cease posting. I hope you understand what I am saying. I do want to help you guys find profitability but at the same time I have my own trading to focus on among other things in life and because of this I can only update this when I have free time. I hope you all don't take it the wrong way. I will post charts later

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Nexas...I totally agree with you..it is diificult for an "actual trader" to post stuff when our job is to actually watch the market..I was a bit taken back with Waheed's comments..you are NOT required to post til you have time..and then its not a requirement..post at your convenience..and we all appreciate your posts..I will say that "impatience" shown by Waheed..might be symptomatic of lack of patience which is not a good trait for a trader...all that being said I think we had a nice sell around 8:56:17 amest.. on the 4 rg....all ma's were 'under" and we had a trendline break for a sell...which I took for 22 ticks..since I trade the currency futures ..a tick =$12.50 whereas a "pip" is worth $10..if you trade the forex...I covered the trade on a macd divergence..which is set at a 4/5/13..so it is very quick setting..and helps to manage a trade...thanks Nexas..and keep the good attitude

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi All, So here are yesterdays trades. For the morning I started off with a win followed by two losses for the initial entry and then reentry at the second trend line. After that came 5 wins followed by a loss and then one more win to round off the morning. For the majority of the trades I was trading to the next support or resistance area apart from the more shallow retracements where I exited on an opposite colour candle. For the afternoon I had three wins in a row before I called it a day as the markets failed to make a lower low and the move started to get really labored. Add that to the fact that I had already had a great day, I thought it best not to push my luck and bank the profits I had made on the day, which were considerable. For all of the entries I am taking the break of the trend line and I am placing my stop behind the swing point. I am then either trading to the next support or resistance or trading until I get an opposite color candle. If my entry happens to fall into the same place as a previous support becomes resistance or visa versa then that is even better. Nexas

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Nexas ..thanks for the posts ..nice day you had..congrats..so that we are on the same page ..what time zone are you located? thNKA

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Nexas that last word in my post s was supposed to be "thanks"..my keyboard has a mind of its own..lol

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Nexas..you mentioned in your posts you take the "the break of the minitrendline"..to clarify are you placing "market orders' to enter the trade..thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Kipr, Yes indeed I use market orders. I feel better that way... perhaps I am a control freak :-). I am located in the UK so GMT. Where are you? So you took the same trades as me yesterday? The markets have been very kind lately :-). Nexas P.S. Don't worry I feel like my whole trading station has a mind of its own at times.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nexas...so you are across the Pond..i'm am in Atlanta..so its Eastern Std time for me ..I think we are 6hrs diff..so for me to trade the 6E at the London open and forward I have to get up and be ready @ 3;00amest..which is quite early for "normal" human beings..That is something I have never been accused of being..:-)...well market orders guarantee a fill..but you often get some slippage..i actually trade the currency futures thru the CME vs the forex..I pay $5 round trip..I like the futures better than forex..but the charts are almost identical..with some slight difference in price vs the "spot " forex..i took several of the trades you posted..but I also have another set-up that I look at..and yesterday was a good day..i have learned to be humble during the good days and thank the markets for cooperating..but with a 5 day ADR running at about 150 there are always going to be some nice trades ..if the trader exercises patience ..and doesnt force the marginal looking trades...Cheers..mate,,thanks

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Nexas, Although I trade a different method, I really like your simple &amp; concise approach. Simple is best in this business. _______________________

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Lol its good to be different! I trade the eminis as well using the same method. We will have to come to an arrangement where I will trade the UK morning for you and you can do the US for me :-) Thanks for contributing to this thread I am sure many of the readers are happy to have input from two traders with similar approaches! How long have you been trading in total now? Or did you start with Range bars?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thank you acetrader! Simple definitely is best, it keeps the guessing out of the game.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
wow what an explosion...amazing what a little central bank collusion can create..lol......hell of a move...Nexas ..I have been trading the futures full time now for about 6 years..prior to I traded equities..got tired of the constant search for hot stocks so as I matured as a trader..the " 1 trick pony" approach I found to be better for me..I have looked at time bars..vol, tick, renko, range ..etc..but i have settled on a combo of time based bars and range bars..i still feel many traders look at the 5 min..which is an important chart to me.I also look at the 1 min chart...and I look out further meaning 15-30-1hr..4hr..daily and weekly..but really only use the range bars..when i am getting ready to pull the trigger&lt; i like them in that they smooth out price action and they make for consistency on entery of market..which is always an issue when using time based charts...6E is my fav..but I also will trade the Russell..and the NQ and occ. gold and oil..I used to trade the ES mini exclusively but i got tired of the backing and filling characteristic of the ESand quit trading it about 3 years ago..I dont jump around into markets chasing the hottest trending market ..I just like to focus on 1 or maybe 2 simultaneously as I tend to make less mistakes with this approach

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Nexas and Kiper Really good stuff here. Thanks for sharing. Here is a question for both of you. Have you looked into hammers and shooting stars using range bars? At just a glance, when taking trend into consideration, they seem to be more reliable than the ones based on time charts. I'm new to NT and can't figure out how to reload historical data for range bars. As long as the platform is connected, everything is good and it builds the chart fine. But when I start the platform and connect (to IB) I have a big gap in my data. The "reload all historical data" is greyed out but when I switch to time frame charts all the data is there! I don' t get it. Thanks for the great discussion and helpful hints. Mark

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Nexas, thanks very much for sharing your method. Just a quick question. When you say you take profits at S/R, do you mean the last swing high/low on the chart that you're trading from, or do you look at longer term S/R such as 4 hr. and daily? Thanks. I like what you're doing here, very simple and based on PA. Good work! --Wally

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi Mark, Thank you! To be honest no I haven't, but I can imagine that they would be more reliable as they are actually based on the price rather than some arbitrary moment in time. Remember candlestick patterns are meant to show the emotion in the market and the fight between the buyers and sellers, so a range bar would show you exactly that for the particular range. However we must lso remember that most trades still use time bars or volume bars so when we are taking our signals it is not necassarily the case that the rest of the market are. Whether that is a good or a bad thing I don't know but what I do know is I could never go back to trading a time chart as my primary entry chart. I hope I haven't confused you with that response. But in any case the one thing I can tell you is that range charts do clear up the price action and do allow you to get into trades which you can expect to react almost immediately in the majority of cases which is good on the psychological aspect of trading. Regarding the gap, I am not sure I can help you there as I have never experienced this. Have you looked at the session template? You need to use the dedicated Forex one. Who proivdes you with your data? Nexas

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Wally, Generally it is on the chart I am trading although I do at times peak at the 5 or 15 minute or 8 range. What I do is I watch the price at the level on the chart I am trading and if it blasts through I will look at another chart, but if it stalls a little, I will just take the money off and wait for a new opportunity. I personally don't pay too much attention to anything above a 1 hour as when I am trading so close to the price, I don't find trading a daily all that much help for direction. I only use something like that to identify key levels. Price is King and simple makes the game easier to play :-) Nexas

--- 帖子 #60 ---
It was very nice... but I missed it as I don't trade during the UK lunch hour (11 - 13:30) I have never traded the Russell, whats it like to trade? Does it trend nicely? I completely agree with you about the one trick pony stuff. There was a time in my life when I would literally try to day trade 30 diferent instruments and I always found I was late to a move, or missed a move and took the only instrument that didn't move and all of that kind of a thing. But since I have been focusing on day trading just a few instruments I find I can be more consistent in my trading and take the majority of my setups which means I am giving my edge the best chance of achieving its full potential.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Regarding the gap, I am not sure I can help you there as I have never experienced this. Have you looked at the session template? You need to use the dedicated Forex one. Who proivdes you with your data? Hi Nexas I have InterActive Brokers for data. I was not using the dedicated forex for session template. I switched it but still gaps in my data? Don't know why but thanks for the try! Mark

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Nexas...yes the Russell does trend really well..and it moves..especially in the morning US session..its not very good pre-market US..but from say 9:40amest-11:45 amest is a good time if you are interested in looking at the Russell..the ticks are worth $10 each..it doesn't have the volume that the 6E does..but it is liquid enough if you trade less than 20lots...appreciate your comment on sticking to 1-2 instruments..I dont know how you can track 20-30 simultaneasly..i know my "pea-sized" brain couldnt handle that as I would be a candidate for "1 flew over the cuckoo's nest" after 1 session of that type of madness..lol..I would have to go into my music room and crank the Marshall stacks to 10 just to calm down....Also as a short term price action trader the bigger time frames dont mean that much to me I do look at them..but only for context.or market landscape...keep trading well! cheers

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Nice system-- I can never go back to time bars - I am big fan of rangebars I am doing well on rangebars-- this is indeed a nice clean profitable system

--- 帖子 #64 ---
A few questions -- what is pip range-- why you dont used horizontal S/R i see you only used diagonal trendlines

--- 帖子 #65 ---
There are so manyways to draw a trend line - ( it is always subjective) what is minimum number of bars before u draw a your trend line - I see your chat some time 4 5 8 -- are they a minimum

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Zamanib, I use horizontal lines only for congestion zone breakouts. The reason I don't at other times is when there is a pullback you can get in earlier and alot of the time you see price mess about when it gets to the orizontal levels before breaking, so I am more comfirtable getting in and out before there is any hint of trouble... do you know what I mean? The minimum on a pullback for me is 4 bars, plus I loke the price to be relatively close to on of the MA's... The range I use is 4 and 8. Nexas

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Kipr, The Russell sounds like a chart I should check out... I think 20 lots should suffice for now . Yes it does send you insane trying to monitor so many. You can more than make a career from trading just a few instruments with a simple system, as long as you are disciplined. In fact you often run in to more problems trying to maintain different systems for different conditions rather than just accept that there will be times when your system doesn't do so well and during those times, protect your capital. My advice to anyone new reading this thread, is to read the dialogue between myself and Kipr to see that keeping it simple really is the way to go. More is not better!

MarkD85....I use zen-fire for my data provider....and noticed when I re-load historical data..and I am using time based charts ie..5min..and the range bars... that when I reload the data..the range bar charts dont really change but the time based bars do..but then both are then current ..so when re-loading d hist data ..you prob need to have at least 1 time based chart open..during the reload...a quirk in ninja 7..they had this same quirk when they started @ ninja 6...then they went thru to ninja6.5 now they are ninja 7..and the quirk still exists..must be some kind of secret govenmental plot against traders..lol

a real nice picture perfect buy @ 8:14:52amEST...28 ticks on runner in about 4 min time...condition was 20 above the 60 above the 100..with a 5-6 bar pb on 4 rg...NOTE..I have noticed that if the pb has a "straight line " to it .. meaning the bars aren't "jagged" ..then the probability for a good move increases..that pullback had the angle of about 5:30 on a time clock..very nice steep angle with straight line decent...I took off the trade on the runner when I saw a red bar........NEXAS..words of wisdom in your post about.."master of 1" vs "jack of all and master of none" is critical issue for traders regardless of experience or screen time...that approach helps minimize overtrading ..and it allows the "reticular' portion of the brain to have instant recall.......ALSO...my initial trading mentor..a very wise and experienced trader...always said..."Its better to be out of the market wishing you were in..than being in the market wishing you were out"...meaning dont be ashamed if you dont take a trade..if in doubt stay out..trust me there will be another set-up just around the corner ..the market is an assembly line of opportunity..so there is no need to chase or force a trade....and sometimes we as traders hesitate and then wish we were in a trade..but its okay...just re-group and reset your focus and start "stalking" the next opportunity..and forget about what just happened..FOCUS on the NOW...enough.said

a nice trade @ 10:18:43 amEST. 4 rg...buy took the runner for 14 ticks before I covered..we had a 7 bar 'straight line ' pback.. with the good 5:30ish clock angle ....we didnt quite get up to previous resistance but when I see bars going into a potential "ledge formation'..I take the $$..

--- 帖子 #71 ---
another observation...even tho I took that buy posted above I was "anxious" to cover as prior to the 5min chart.(.I use the time based charts to help me understand the price action in context.). had recently painted in a lower low swing and a higher low swing..so that indicates that there could be a change of sentiment..and if you notice after that successful trade there was quite a quick shift to the downside..just a tidbit that i hope helps

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi, just made 2 winning trades with this great system...last one taken on the 4 range for +12 pips. Exited on the last swing low. SL was 6 pips, so r/r = 1:2. Thank you far sharing, Nexas. Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #73 ---
wtg Olarion..nice trade..can anyone help me..I have a trading computer that is just used for trading ..and then this computer for FF..Skype...email etc....and also i am not very smart with computers..basically a functioning illiterate..so my Q is how do I post "screenshots' ..and get the screenshot from my trading computer on to this computer so I can show my trades in picture form..sure would help save a big hazzle for all.???...thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Another nice trade (I did not take it...) A little too late after london close for me. But still good for at least + 15 pips with less than 10 pip risk.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
another 4 rg sell..@12:58:19pmEST...made 14 ticks on the runner and 4 ticks on the 1st contract..=18total...(only traded 2 c's) got stopped on my trailing stop....I am in the "batters box' when I see the the transistion from + to - on the 20ema all ma's were properly aligned for a sell around 12:42pmEST....often the 1st pullback after the cross over yields a good trade....normally I'm not real fond of trading at this time of day..but today we are seeing pretty good swings..even thru the US doldrums..done for day...all toll...7 winners 1 loser..and that loser was a mstake by me..i forced the trade and paid the piper...but overall happy with today's performance...Thank Mr. Market for the cooperation and get ready for another trading day manyana.....overall today was a "tight" inside day vs yesterday(which is to be expected..after yesterday's explosion)..but there was some nice 2 sided trading ...

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hey kipr, it's not that complicated. After saving the chart, transfer it from your trading computer to your other computer (USB stick, shared network drive etc.). Then post your chart by using the "attachments" button in the reply box, then browse and upload the saved file. That's all! If you have any further questions, please ask.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Great trade, man. That must be the one I did not take and posted just before...

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Thanks Olarion....can I use "Dropbox' to transfer image from trading computer to this computer??.. cause I am not familiar with things you mentioned in post??..sorry...but again my computer skills(or lack thereof)..are limited.....again confirming..you can be a dumbass and still extract $$ from the markets..lol

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hey man, sure...Dropbox is great...using it myself.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Nice going guys! some real nice trading going on here. The way it should be, simple but effective. @Kipr - you mentor sounds like a wise man and he is so right. Not taking a position is effectively a position! @Olarion - Nice to see you are doing well. One comment regarding your last trade posted that you didn't take. Be careful about taking trades that have broken and stayed above the 100 MA. They do work out but have lower probability. Things that help those trades are previous support or resistance and of course the fact that the risk reward on them are so much higher so you can afford to be wrong 70% of the time with them and still make some, but just be advised that the strike rate is as high as the more standard setups where the price is on the right side of the MA's. BUt apart from that, some nice trading there!!!!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Yesterday mornings trading started off with two straight losses for me, but then I was able to make it back with the subsequent trades in the morning. The important lesson there is to not be discouraged and make the classic newbie mistake of not taking the next trade. Generally you should set yourself a daily stop loss and if you have not reached it, then you are doing your self a disservice by not taking all VALID setups. If I had taken the attitude that the market didn't like me and hence not take the next trade then I would have ended with a loss instead of making money. Nexas

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Nexas, ok, thanks for the hint. Seems like a nice pullback on the 8 range, right? I am long EU... UPDATE: Out at BE, anticipated a break through resistance...should better have taken the + 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Nexas, do you move your stop to BE after a few pips or take partial profits?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Olarion, I didn't get long on the 8 range chart. I took a a small profit this morning from the 4 range. Only 6 pips, but I saw the resistance and price was struggling with it so I thought bank it. The 8 range for me was rather range bound. At the moment I am waiting for some momentum in either direction. Regarding moving the stop, yes I do at times but more often than not it is to my detriment. As in price takes me out then sales to my profit target. So it is something that I am doing less of nowadays. But if we are in the market condition that we are this morning then I would move my stop of take profits earlier than usual, simple because there is no real momentum in the markets. Nexas

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Nexas....great observation on taking profits, when the market is in a consolidation... you want to be taking them quicker ..than if the market has expansion..this is why it is so important for the trader to constantly be looking @ the "condition-or landscape"..When there is good movement..you want to loosen the stop so as to be able to "ride the wave' longer..markets can and do change on a "dime" but the only best info we have to judge the "condition" is what has previously happened..If the trader has a statistical edge..as evidenced by good "record" keeping" be it back testing(which I'm not a big fan of)or forward testing..then that builds the confidence for the trader to have loses and still know that you will make $$ with proper execution....mark Douglas said it well in "trading in the zone" as Rules for traders..Quote.."There is a random distribution between wins and loses for ANY given set of variables that define an edge".. When i do have a "string" of loses in my mind I know that I am that much closer winning..as I know that I have an edge....with all that ..so far today.. since the London open the market is crap..I have taken 1 good trade /look at how "hairy" the 5 min candles are..wicks, top and bottom on almost every candle ..so we are coiling up for something good to happen..this is where traders often get killed trying to force the action...Let the market tell YOU the story..read it like a good novel..

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Kipr, Yup you got that right... the more losses in a row you get the more excited you should be getting as it means that the winners are that much closer! This morning has been a bit horrific but I have managed to bag one winner and one break even. Once I realised what sort of a market we were in I decided to just not trade until we get momentum, hence cutting one short at be. I am guessing the US is going to drive the price today. Nexas

--- 帖子 #87 ---
finally ..took buy @ 5;59amEST...( I trade the euro currency futures so the #'s are slightly off compared to forex)..but b@1.3480.. stopped on trail @1.3500 @ 6:43:07 .. market had an 'uptilt " to it.. in this previous condition ..am happy with that kind of price pop...

--- 帖子 #88 ---
4 rg sell...I dont trade 5 min before and about 5 min after a scheduled econ report...but @ 8:35:15 amEDT..took s got 16 ticks on the runner..for a total of 20t on trade (2 lot)..trailing stop took me out...1st pullback after the 20 was under the 60 under the 100..often the 1st pb after the ma's line up properly= a good trade..

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi kipr, nice trade..was it on EU?? On my chart nothing lined up for shorts...the 20 was above the 60 and the 60 above the 100 EMA...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I was in the same one at 13:35 and then again at 13:44. Took some nice profits. Now the market is coiling again so I will wait for a move before jumping in again me thinks...

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Olarion, Mine was on the EU as was Kipr's I would think. But you are correct the MA's did not line up, the 20 for me was below all of the others but the 60 was above the 100. However I took it because I was watching the reaction to the news and we seemed to have good momentum. I did however only take that one in half the size I would normally. The 13:44 was picture perfect though. Did you get that? Nexas

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Nexas, could you pleas post a chart of your entry? On mine the 20 was way above all others EMAs for a long time on the 4 range... Thanks.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi Olarion, Yes certainly. Please see below for both the trades I took. Let me know if you have any questions. They were taken just after the non farm's. Nexas

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thanks for the chart, Nexas. The EMAs look totally different than mine...see my chart below. I have set them to 20 ema, 60 ema and 100 ema. Could you see the difference or tell me where my setup is wrong?? My whole chart looks different....what is wrong?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Just snatched another very quick one at 14:45

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Olarion, You are right... it really does... I don't know why that is? That is extremely strange. Where do you get your range bar indicator from? Mine is from Ninja trader with a Kinetick data feed. Nexas

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I used the constant range bars indicator that someone posted here on the thread...very strange. I try to get another one or will change to ninja trader soon me thinks... PS: Are the emas set to CLOSE? Or OPEN, HIGH?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
mmm that is a good question. I don't have the option to change in the EMA's I have in ninja trader so I would assume close. Ninja trader is an all round better platform than metatrader so if you can spare I think around $50 per month is is more than worth it...

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Just wrote you a PM.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I just replied

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I just had a loss at 15:00, then a second bite of the cherry and a win 15:06

--- 帖子 #102 ---
It seems as the problem is solved...somehow the emas did not refresh. After loading the template again, my chart looked like yours. Btw, just made +24 pips on the 4rg EU (exit at the color change) with a 10 pip risk...pullback to the 20 ema and break of the trendline. I am done for today. PS: Should have kept a little longer...would have hit my TP with +60 pips. Nevermind, green pips are good pips.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Congratulations Olarion! I just missed that one and the one after which also would have made money... damn phone rang!!!! Overall a very good week for me... I hope it was for you guys too!!!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Thank you. Nice to hear you made money this week, I wish I could say the same... I really like your system because of 2 reasons: range bars keep you out of the choppy price action SL is always very little and the r/r very high Not a good week at all for me until I discovered your system. I hope from now on I will be more consistent. Next week will show. Olarion

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Olarion...I actually trade the 6E is what ninja calls the 'Euro" currrency futures traded thru the CME....there are slight differences..in my price vs.. the forex spot market..they are usually within 6-7 ticks in the forex pairs Euro/usd..the denomination is a pip..which =$10usd..in the currency futures market they are called ticks..and in the 6E (euro) a tick is the denomination and each tick is worth.12.50..I prefer the CME 6E futures vs the forex..for several reasons..you can read volume of contracts traded,,much tighter spread..usually if you enter @ market you get 1 tick'slippage...my roundtrip cost /trade is $5usd..,,much greater "transparency' as the CME is regulated..and I never have to worry about trading against my Broker..some forex "brokers" charge a huge spread 3pips..and they will often take positions against you..so if a forex broker tells you they dont charge a "commission" in fact they are ripping you off with the spread..if there is a 3 pip spread you actually paid $30.00usd per contract/round trip..ISnt that nice of them to charge no commissions...So forex is kind of the "wild west" of trading...Incidently i am not endorsing them ..but I use Mirus Futures..and they are outstanding ..but there are others if you shop around..I never have to worry about my Broker trading against my position..and they are all "series licensed" people..the only way they profit is the transaction fee...so I'm not knocking the forex..but its not for me.. so that is why when I post I dont post prices as it would probably confuse folks..but the charts are very close to each other..i will tell you that Nexas's wonderful.approach actually works with any liquid Market or "instrument"...make sense?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
kipr, You are correct.......forex can be like the wild west (shootout @ the OK Coral), but I have somehow managed to survive since late 1999. From your post you seem to have a good command of trading currency futures &amp; seem like the kind of guy willing to share your knowledge of that market. If that is correct I would like to swap PM"s with you &amp; get some more info on how its done. I have already researched the broker you spoke of &amp; they are appealing at this point. Going the PM route would keep from clogging up Nexas's thread. Let me know if you have the time &amp; the desire to do this &amp; I will send you one this weekend, but I do have two funerals (NO WEDDINGS) to attend, so it might be Sunday. Thanks for your time &amp; consideration. _______________________________

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Olarion, I am sorry to hear that! If you follow this simple system and stay disciplined then you should be on your way to consistency. However you must learn to take losses... once you do this you will be on your way, as this is probably the single hardest thing to do when trading. If you need any help, we will try to help you here! Nexas

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Nexas...again a very insightful post you have made regarding..learning to accept losses....a trader should learn to embrace stop losses...I make a dumb analogy here..If a person is standing on the side of a road..and decides to cross the road..first, most sane folks would look both ways to see if the "coast is clear"this is what the trader does when the price action matches their specific criteria to "enter a trade" or to risk $$ to make $$...so the coast looks like its clear and the trader decides to cross the road..the trader takes 1 step into the road ..and here comes a car fullspeed at the trader..the trader steps back and the car "grazes" the trader..but the "stop loss" or "step back" kicks in and trader gets a bruise..but the quick "step back" prevented the trader from getting killed..and therefor once the trader "recovers" his/her nerve..the trader is again able to try to accomplish the mission which is to cross the road...I have learned to embrace stop losses ..as even with our best efforts, "random noise" or "Brownian motion" happens(car came out of nowhere)..or as the old saying goes "shit happens"...If I didnt learn to embrace stops...I would no longer be trading....capital preservation is the key and stop losses insure that the trader will be able to continue to "play the game"..and if you cant play you cant win.....I know of a Trader.. that didn't use stop losses..he was an arrogant type..and went for 2 years as a position trader..unscathed...and BOOM finally the "law of numbers" got him..He is no longer a trader as he blew up his accounts..arrogance and lack of understanding of the logic behind stop losses will guarantee the trader will lose over time.. so learn to think of a stop loss as a good friend..a true friend that has your best interest in mind...

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Nice post Kipr. Indeed staying in the game is the hardest but most important aspect of trading. In the beginning you should trade a tiny percentage of your account and then only once you have earned the right through consistency and discipline can you increase your percentage. The aim in the beginning cannot be to make lots of money, it has to be to learn the rules and protect your capital. Once you do this consistently the profits will take care of themselves. Nexas

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thank you Nexas...for sure this trading business is not a get rich quick scheme..if you want that try for a lottery..1 of the greatest traders of all time was a gentleman named Ed Seykota..if not familiar with him "Google"..unbelievably profitable trader..his 4 rules are simple...1)cut losses..2)ride winners..3) keep bets small..4) follow the rules without question..meaning "set-up" criteria..5) know when to break the rules..that rule he included so the trader doesnt "stifle" his mental engagement ..He said that #5 was probably break even over the long run..but it develops "trader intuition" over time....btw he is a pretty solid banjo player

Hi Nexas; What are the time slot to operate this system ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #113 ---
hi all my1st post on forexfactory. out of all the systems this looks intriguing and original i will start ninjatrader 2wk trial with it, until i figure out how to do it on mt4. some of the results are solid re: timeframe do u only trade active/liquid hours. do you avoid asian session. i am in sydney and sometimes asia session only good for scalping m1 m5 chart.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
hi in mt4, anyone know how to get the range bars working properly?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Go to post #25, but I don't know if it matches the one on Ninja. Maybe we should ask Nexas to post a recent screenshot compare his to Mt4 indi. Hope this helps. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #116 ---
those are some good examples. they say pattern breaks can be good, and we are effectively scalping the market. have u tried it on a few different pairs, it might be a good one for euraud/cad, gold, or eurgbp also.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
hi i tried doing it, but when i open offline chart no difference. i think it can only be done in ninja

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi All, Rearding timeframes I generally trade from 8am to 11am GMT and then 13-13:30 to 16:00 GMT. So unfortunately I cannot speak for how the system performs outside of these hours. Regarding the MT4 indicator, I think the best person to ask would be Olarion since he uses this. About the other pairs, we spoke about this earlier on in thread, but basically it is actually better to only trade a few instruments and get consistent with that rather than trying to chase many. What happens when you do this is you always end up missing the right move and doing silly things to get into the trade. I mainly focus on the EURUSD and I get more than enough opportunities in a day, and those days that I don't is usually the same for all of the other pairs as well. Plus you need to factor in the spread which can cause this profitable system to lose money. You don't really want to be trading this 3 pip spreads and the like. You want to be at around 1 pip spread or there abouts. We are doing this to make money here and for that fact you need to factor in everything else including your trading costs. I hope that sheds some light on things. Nexas

--- 帖子 #119 ---
By the way, I won't be trading today and perhaps the entire week as my PC has decided to pack up on me. I will try and fix it today but if that doesn't work it will be off to PC world to buy a new one... so that means that I will be less active on the trading front but more active on the forum front Just in case you are wondering, I am posting from my Macbook air which is grossly underpowered so I wouldn't even attempt to trade from it even if Ninja Trader had a native solution for OSX, which it doesn't.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
totally i agree. i used to look at all different pairs but the average movement per week of EURUSD and AUDUSD /GBPUSD is enough to make some pips. you only need 80-100 green pips per week to be a good trader. all the fx pairs are correlated anyway. makes no difference watching the rest, they all move similar fashio so just catch the move where the cost of doing business is the lowest. anyways good system, ive been interested in a similar concept here http://www.fxtsp.com/trading-strateg...-strategy.html its the same thing, but on m1 chart instead of range bars. i tested it decent quick pips, but itll be better with urs. ill get it sorted out on mt4. since im in aus. audusd is ideal i hate long hourly charts or anything higher than m15. you only get a couple of signals per week on the higher tf charts

--- 帖子 #121 ---
sorry to hear about your computer woo's..Nexas ..good luck...as far as different pairs go..the Euro/usd.. the 5day ADR is currently @ 167ish..that gives a trader more than ample opportunity..so again as Nexas has said why look at multiple markets..true there may be some slow periods of consolidation but the historical ADR in the Euro..seems to be around 110-120..so there is and IMHO will continue to be good volitility...and if it dries up then I will look to other opportunities..but currently this instrument is horse you can ride,,, 1 key for any trader is to FOCUS...easy to say harder to do..also every market has subtle behaviour characteristics..and when you focus the trader is more apt to pick up on those

--- 帖子 #122 ---
nice buy @ 9:25:51amEST..tline break buy..33t winner 29 on runner 4 on 1st contract....covered when I saw red candle

What a great day...took a long trade on EU for +23 pips... Initial risk was 11 pips. I am done for today as I have to go to the dentist now... PS: There was a nicer pullback on the 4rg that kipr took a few candles later...but I was already in the trade ;-)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Nice work Olarion...you drilled the market and now you get to be drilled by the dentist..there is symmetry in that somehow..lol

Congrats, kipr! You took the "nicer" trade...;-) I`m off to the dentist...

Look at you guys rubbing salt in my already open wounds Well done guys its nice to see you are stealing those pips!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Nexas..curiosity got the cat...I have to ask ,with all the myriad of moving average combinations ..ie..wma..ema..hma..sma..smma..etc. ad naseum....20x50..3x8..100x200..etc etc..why did you settle on the combination of 20ema.60ema..and 100ema..as the combination? thanks

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hehe... to be honest, there isn't anything magic behind it, they just seem to work. The 20 was because I reade Pitbull by my hero Marty Schwartz and he uses a 10... but then 10 was little two close so I doubled it. The 60 was from something I read as well but don't recall the source and the 100 just seems to be a bit of an industry standard. I knew what I wanted and that combination worked... but then I would imagine most similar combinations would work just the same... I hope you are not dissapointed by my rather arbitrary reasoning...

--- 帖子 #129 ---
You were dead right, man...got a nice root canal treatment and 3 further appointments... I really prefer drilling the market rather than getting drilled... So far a profitable week for me...made +3% on my (small) live account today. See you guys tomorrow at london open. @Nexas: do you really trade 3 hours of the london session?? That's middle in the night for you, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi everyone, I've been a lurker here from 2008 but decided to register because of your use of range bars. I have been studying a method that utilizes range bars for some time now. I am beginning to trade live and will be trying to trade 1-3 nights a week for the first three hours of the London open. I live in CST and work full time so we shall see... The reason I like what Nexus has laid out here is that it is simply (and correct me if I'm wrong) buying / selling pullbacks on a trend. The methodology I have been studying uses different EMAs: the 21, 55, and 89. But as Nexus has said, these are largely arbitrary. It really does suprise me how few traders use CRBs in their trading. I will be posting charts as I develop my own method but I wanted Nexus and the posters in here to know that there are lurkers actively following this thread. You all have been most helpful and generous with your time and for that I thank you!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
First of all Welcome that you`re here . You can post here that stuff which really provide us more knowledge surely every one plus nexas appriciate that I`m also new trader

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Nexas...appreciate your honest answer..often things are discovered by some trial and error..hunting and pecking or whatever you want to call it...there does seem to be a good ratio of the 3ema's..but you now how "mental midgets" work..I am always trying to tweek things..or find out the "why' behind it it..but have been reminded on several occassions 'it doesnt matter' how things work ..just as long as they work..lol.....I have also learned that it doesnt matter what combo you use just as long as the combo is consistent....if ya throw spaghetti,against a wall, with the same velocity and amount of Spaghetti..you should see a similar amount sticking to the wall..each time you throw the stuff..:-0

okay traders every once in a while you put a trade on and you hit a Home Run...we had a 4rg sell@13:41:06pmEST ..4 bar "straight line pullback....and boom S/P rating agency put Ger,Fr.Neth..Lux..Aus..on "negative credit" watch downgrade..@ 13:42 ..and within 1/2 hr we had a 70+tick/pip drop..we had 3 'qualified pback sells in that cycle..I had a huge winner ..and managed it as best as possible..you will never squeeze every tick out of a trade..but I got a good portion of it..the point of this post being..you never know if you are going to hit a single..or a home run..but all the ingredients to a good probability trade was there..

--- 帖子 #134 ---
it appears to have performed very good today given solid early longs on the way up and an early entry(according to one person) on the S&amp;P news spike. a system is good provided it can give reasonably early entries since we are intraday trader impossible for me to stay up though, as im in asia

--- 帖子 #135 ---
hi olarion. please let me know how to do the range bar for mt4, struggling to do it

--- 帖子 #136 ---
seems to have performed very well again. heres the screenshot of 4 range. seemed like i got it okay? of course i have to add the MAs, but have a look the chart looks very clean compared to the m1 m5 charts which are junky. no wonder i cant trade proper with those charts. but not to say it is holy grail, money management, S&amp;R always hold firm, but thats a valid short at key resistance and it turned out home run trade.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
hi there was a big move just then. can we take longs from under the EMAS nexas. if so it would've resulted ina a huge profit just then

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Halba..you can take a trade anytime you want for any reason..but Nexas's approach is with the trend meaning all the ema's have be "stacked" in either direction...meaning if the 20 is above the 60 and the 60 is above the 100..then look to take buys....Price can pback below the ma's but the ema's should not "cross"..read the 1st page in this thread again..and then read it again....Nexas is only showing the Euro/USD

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi All, Kipr is correct, the EMA's have to be lined up as this gives us the permission to trade so to speak. It keeps us with the trend and out of the chop for the most part. Also I do only trade the EURUSD from an FX perspective although I am sure it will also work on others. Nexas

Hi Nexus, Great system have been messing around with Renko lately but these Range Bars give a different view. Could you post Charts for todays trades Cheers, Eamonn.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Nexas.... congrats on a proftiable day...you must have already paid for the newest bad-assed computer with today's gift from Mr market...btw Marty Schwartz is the definition of a real and great trader...the Pitbull confirms that hard work, determination, and success attitude..is a real formula..he has my utmost respect

--- 帖子 #143 ---
As i`m seeing that you`re one of most active person in this thread and trying to help other can you make a vieo tutorial about nexas strateg it`ll be a leading act

--- 帖子 #144 ---
waheed...I am here to try to help and point out stuff..but I am just a humble trader..dont know how to make video's or instructional films..and if I did it would only confuse ..as Nexas is trading the Euro/usd pair and I am trading the euro futures currency so there is some minor discrepancies in the price although the charts will be very similar..also.. just observe the posts and be patient..and READ the charts..there is no magic formula..identify the set-up..and if you like it take the trade and use good risk control..and $management..and understand that not every trade will be successful..but the probabilities are there for successful growth of your working capital...that is the beauty of Nexas's approach..the ole KISS..I have a few things that I use for "feel good" confirmations..but they are not absolutely necessary..and I will continue to share as I can...

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Nexas, Just wondering how you came to settle on the size of the range bars ? Have you experimented with different ranges like 6 &amp; 12 or 5 &amp; 10 ? I've been looking for a good range bar system for quite a while now and I really like what you've presented here. It's really a good strategy! By the way, I would never have guessed you were from the UK since I couldn't detect a British accent from reading your posts...lol Take Care....T-Wolf

traders... I hit em twice "back to back" in a tight sideways type market..buys as the ema's were stacked properly..12:11pmEST..14ticks total(2 lot)...covered with red candle..and 1/2candle wick at top..and 13:24 12 ticks total(2lot)..this is a good example of sideways trading..I will hit em twice in that type of market condition ..and have found that more often than not if there is a 3rd set-up I pass..as it is my theory that by the time everytrader can figure out the sideways the market manipulators change ..or shift lanes to trap Mr. Retailer..it is a scalp technique..I take 1 off at 4(meaning you have to get to 5 to bank 4) and let 1 run with a very tight stop..and then get out at any warning ..ie red bar..reversal bar and red..or a top of range...etc....so its not get rich type trading but a good technique to bank a few...if you notice the next "cycle" when price got o the support area they went thru support thus trapping some weak hands,,@ 13:53pmedt..and then the 20 ema's rolled over below the 60..so it is important to not just "assume" that price was going to go back up...the mini-tlines help in keeping you out a bad trades more often than not...hope it helps

Guys, here is my little contribution to someone who like to add 3 EMA's as histogram on chart.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
hi kipr possible to post ure charts today on which ones u took thanks. no need to post any text u gave ure reasoning system one uses needs to be simple. re: 20 ema going below 60 ema what does that signify, sorry am bit new. i always use TLs or lines/patterns , but its on the m1,m5 charts, sometimes they break valid, sometimes break/retest, sometimes just plain false break before shooting up

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Haha, you couldn't detect it from my posts... and what does a british accent read like? I am intrigued... Its funny some people say I don't have a typical british accent when I speak either, perhaps because I went to an American University. Regarding the range bars... For each instrument, I simply apply the 4 to start with which I have found via trial and error to be the best for short term trading. Then if the chart looks to choppy I go up and work my way from there until I find a range that works well with the MA's and defines trends nicely. Nexas

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Kipr, Great job there with the trades! Nice explanations as usual! Nexas

--- 帖子 #151 ---
hi there was also a 3rd one kipr, but it was below the EMAS, but if u draw rising trend line u could see there was a bounce at minor support. not too risky as good risk to reward ratio, provided u ignore the emas and followed the rising TL and went long after 1 bull candlestick bounce of support. the 3rd one was almost a home run - 32 pips see attached chart there was also an earlier one, same situation, but not as many range bars to qualify. http://i42.tinypic.com/14s3gh.gif

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hello guys ... sorry i Did not read all the posts. I just looked at the pictures/images . And it's look like a flag trending trade setup which is a highly profitable trading setup... Keep the good work...

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Aahh, that explains it. You went to an American University! What school did you go to? I went to the school of Hard Knocks,I'm still trying to graduate....LOL A British accent might read like this if a Brit got a margin call, "What the Bloody Hell just happened" or when a British trader is finished trading for the day he might say "That's me, done for the day" ......anyway, it's all in good fun and thanks Nexas for your input on determining range bar size. Stay tuned for more humor because I believe we should have fun when we're trading, anyway ,that's the way I roll {American accent} LOL...T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #154 ---
attached similar system but on timeframe charts. whats ure opinion nexas. i tested it, it does give some good scalps but timeframe charts are noisier, but u need a trend on the two below, it gave 2 good winners(time when published unknown) http://i39.tinypic.com/xqmfc7.gif http://www.fxtsp.com/trading-strateg...-strategy.html

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Habla.good observation hope you took the trade..I didnt as the 20ema on my chart dipped below the 20ema and on top of the 100ema..but again I trade the currency futures and not the spot forex....on my charts we did have 2 more set-ups with the stacked ema's but by then i was burned out..since i was trading since 5amEST..I do this to allow me to enjoy a lifestyle and not be a slave to the markets....i also had already banked a nice day..and i didnt want the risk of giveback..

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thunderwolf..good attitude..and if it aint fun it aint worth..doing..most human beings perform better with a light heart...everytime i look in the mirror ..i realize that i have to have sense of humor..or i would have some serious issues..lol.. a very successful trader once told me"everything is funny when you make lots of money'...as it should be..that being said its cocktail time here in the good ole south

--- 帖子 #157 ---
hi kipr. you are a good trader. it is nice to be relaxed, as these charts its reasonable commitment, but not as intense as say an m1 chart. a hint for you kipr, there is a broker with zero spread on EURUSD spot if u wish send me a pm, they are good provider and offer 0 spread eurusd usdjpy. worth a look. you only pay 1 pip spread(total incl. buy and sell) in a winning trade

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Nexus I had a question about the pullbacks you are looking for. You said on the 4 range bar setting you are looking for a pullback of at least 4 bars. Are you looking for 4 bars of direct pullback, or can the 4 bars overlap? Also, does it matter if the pullback violates any of the EMAs? Thanks! Still following with interest.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Kipr, Glad to hear you have a sense of humor too, but I don't think you have any serious issues. My suggestion....Get a new mirror! Go enjoy your cocktail Kipr. I don't drink so I think I'll just have a beer .....T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Nexus, Excellent thread going here. Nice to find a like minded trader. I think I have found a new home!!! I will share why. I have been trading on and off for the last 9 years. The first 2 years in the stock market until I found Forex. I have been following Forex Factory since I started and was a "Kumo Warrior" on the "Ichimoku Forever" thread. I have run the gambit - purchased all the systems, read all the books, blown 2 live accounts, tried every indicator, etc...... My best performance was years ago when I traded without indicators and just used good old chart patterns. I turned an $1,000 account into $16,800 in just under 7 months. This is not bragging as you can guess how I did it. Yes, I over leverage the snot out of my trades. Very poor Money management. Maybe good trade management? Ah, who am I kidding! Just plain luck! Actually my cat entered a short trade on the USDCAD once and it turned into a decent winner! When the US economy tanked so did my business (self-employed architect) and I ended up taking out all but $500 to pay some life expenses. Lost site of my trading and have been hit or miss for the last year doing the novice holy grail search. A few months ago I decided to take a step back and analyse my past experience and what truly worked for me. PRICE ACTION, trendlines and S/R levels. And most important Money Management and Trade Management (yes, I seperate the two). That is it. I decided to look at what truly would show me price action and I discovered Renko and Constant Range Bars. I have been doing studies with both and they both work. Similar but different. I opted for CBR's.... I have tried different Range sizes and combos as some else mentioned. I ended up with 3 pip and 9 pip. I also have a standard candle chart up to monitor what the herd/ mass of traders are watching and to look for longer term S/R zones. This has brought me full circle in my trading. Back to what IS REAL and now or in the moment!!! I am currently putting in writing my business plan and methodology. No, really, I am doing it! I have started my trading log, but going to reorganize it. I take a screen shot of the setup forming (to recall what I was looking at), my entry and my take profits and final exit. Do a write up after trading hours. I just need to decide what my real trading hours are going to be as I am working full-time (no not for myself anymore). My last change will be getting switched to a futures based broker and using Ninja. Kipr, Great posts. You seem to be another trader that is proffesional in his trading. I agree with you on the futures (6E) aspect. I have tried a Mirus demo. I need to learn a little more in regards to the futues market, contracts and the amount of equity truly needed to get started. But then I am there... The only advantage of staying with my IBFX account is the mini and micros as I am still trying to recover with the economy. For the Metatrader users you can download for free a great CBR EA from this link: http://www.surefiretradingchallenge.com/crb-K17kvXN/ There are 3 choices Use the middle one - Click Here To Download The Constant Range Bars EA Installer It will auto install for you, you just have to tell it where your Metatrader is when asked. Then follow the instructions. Remember it is an EA not an indicator and only runs when the markets are open. You can also download the manual. Hope to be able to contribute in the near future, but will be watching until then. Thanks KRMO P.S. - Sorry if I bored anyone, just excited to find like minded traders. Good PIPS to all....!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Halba, Nice trades, the only thing I would say is that had it not been for the trend line you drew I would have switched to the 8 range as the pull back was a little too much and it seemed like the price was finding resistance. But other than that it was a good oppostunity especially for the risk reward. Nexas

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hehe... now that would be telling. I went to AIU its an international school more than anything. I will be happy to come to your graduation party when it comes :-)/ Your absolutely right we should have fun, so I will task you with that responsibility :-) Well old chap, I hope you have a jolly good day and one looks forward to conversing with more in the future (He says with a tweed jacket and top hat on) :-)

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I just really need the market to halt a little before jumping in. Yes if they breach the 100 EMA and stays the other side for too long I move to the 8 range for confirmation. Nexas

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Krmo, No you didn't bore us at all, it always nice to hear of a persons journey! We welcome you here to our humble abode and look forward to your contributions. You seem like you are doing things properly so I have no doubt you will be successful! Nexas

--- 帖子 #165 ---
hi nexas price is most important in a ranging market, if u buy to high u get whipped out risk reward ratio(RRR) most important thing in trading i reckon notice lots of ppl making mistakes on FF - shorting AUDUSD for instance or EURUSD, but at those levels they short its only around medium level, not high %. i used to make those silly mistakes not anymore.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hello all posters &amp; readers, I dabble with Range Bars from time to time, looking to supplement my main strategy which is longer term, some excellent posts here lately, hopefully I can pick up some tips and maybe help others also, thanks guys. Here is my current chart setup and watching the EUR-USD, must be waiting on news or all traders gone home, very narrow range day, possible big move later in the week, any ideas? Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
absolutely no range to work with today. okay for a range trader buying at the extremes

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Nexas, I have completed my first trading session using your methodology. I like the simple, yet powerful premise it is build on namely the bare minimum of indicators to ensure you trade with the trend. The range bars also seems to keep the noise to the minimum making it emotionally easier to trade.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
had a decent winner..6:11:52amEST..entry(waited til after German Ind prod report)covered @ 6:21:22..as price looked to be in a mini ledge formation..I dont like sitting on trades when the momentum seems to have stalled...with 2 lot got 16ticks total.....again I trade the currency futures and not the forex..so the #'s dont perfectly match to forex but the same idea..when a stall seems to appear..I usually tighten the noose on the runner....and if the price turns back hard (after I get stopped out)its a bit of a guess..in this case it turned out to be the right move as the retrace came all the way past my entry...but its a guess at best as often I will do that and price just pauses and leaves me in the dust..and then you feel stupid....a trader should learn to trust their intuition..or gut..

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Nice trade, kipr! I saw that one forming but did not take it due to lunch time in Europe (low volatility). I took another trade in the morning for +30 pips...so I am waiting now for NY open to take further trades. Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #171 ---
wtg..Olarion...nice trade

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks kipr, cannot post charts in the moment...busy at work in the office... Could not resist...took another perfect one on the 4 range for quick +12 pips. PS: I am trading via TeamViewer on my notebook at home...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Just took another nice one for +12 pips...money is coming in now...

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Just took profit on 2 trades where I added another position as I saw a second setup forming... Both were on EU on the 4 range chart for a total of another +50 pips!! PS: Result for today: +104 pips See chart below:

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Olarion: I see that you use Oanda Meta trader like me. I tried the indicator posted in second page but didn't work. Are you using the same indicator? Thanks ...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi, yes I use the one posted here, but it is an expert advisor. So you have to put it into the experts folder and use it accordingly.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Olarion..is kicking ass and taking names ..wtg

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Thanks, man...I hope you drilled the market, too...but I believe you did...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
nice winners. olarion there were more pippage in gbpusd today

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks....might be, but I don't trade other pairs than EU...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
well as long as you are making positive pips thats what counts. this method is solid.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Nice trading Olarion! You seem to be really picking this up! You are also right to just focus on the one pair. You really don't need anymore, which ever instrument you pick just stick with that and get to know it intimately! You are on the right track, all that stands in your way is taking some losses and then remaining confident, that will be your hardest challenge, but if you can remain focused and come through it, you will be well on the road to achieving all of your goals!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
am slowly getting a feel for this system. 4 range setups on aud,there were 4 valid setups recently,, higher TF on strong uptrend recent so good strength. whereas eu etc not as much strength. any of the 4 would've won some pips. enter immediately on the break at good level with solid candlestick, rather than wait for a close and buy at higher price, lower the better for longs, reasonable risk reward all the way to the top. MAs all in line well. seems the net effect - we are buying the dip on a retrace/consolidation in the hope it continues the trend. so its a trend following system which is better. looks like it is going down again, so wait now until it goes below the MA or wait for a long again. if short against counter trend if you make quick pip just close position. looking at the pic, an aggressive short entry was also on at 1.03 resistance also, forget the MAs and use S&amp;R. that is also a valid trade, up about 7 pip currently. notice the head and shoulder confirmation on the chart, so all three reasons could be used to take the short trade scalp. http://i40.tinypic.com/2i8vtdv.gif http://i39.tinypic.com/10ofsc5.gif

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I have this taped to my forehead..which makes for a nice look when I'm out in public..which is only 1 time per decade..:-)...a very important question to get a read on the "market landscape" or "condition".."are they buying the dips or selling the rallies" we had 2 really nice very tradable swings today..high to low..and then retrace to the fib78....but only a 103tick range ..and our 5per ADR is around 140..on a higher frame you can see the wedge we a funnelling into..and we have the ECB min bid rate manyana..followed by the infamous "press conf" and US unemployment claims ..so should be intresting session..trade well..not dangerous..you want danger jump into a Lion's mouth..so be careful around the econs..

--- 帖子 #185 ---
see how the counter trend trade worked out bear in mind reasons above held. its a perfect trade 10/10 http://i42.tinypic.com/2egbrmb.gif

EUR-AUD Waiting for the MA's to cross back over to downside, to continue the main trend, after the news spike this morning Price already hit the ADR predicted high - price label on top right, 80 pips to travel down to ADR predicted low

--- 帖子 #187 ---
EUR-USD Anyone else like to see a downside breakout of today's 28 pips range? Maybe at Europe open....or will they cook up some "good" news for EZ?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hey Erebus Nice charts. I have been looking for a ADR indicator like that. Can you share it? Most ADR indicators I have come across have alot of extra stuff with them that clutters the charts too much for my taste. Thanks. Mark

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I sure would like to do that, but it is purchased, got my name on it &amp; locked to my computer! However, it is available at Google for compassfx adr Not posting links due to NO advertising allowed rule

--- 帖子 #190 ---
No problem. I'll check it out. Thanks. Mark

A long setup is forming after London open.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
hi i think there was already 1 signal earlier gave about 15 pips looks another forming

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Agree, I took that one too, for 10 pips Edit:And lost that 10 pips on second trade.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi All, PLease be careful over the next two days... there is a lot going on in terms of meetings and announcements, so don't be to surprised if the moves seem laboured until the releases. Nexas

--- 帖子 #195 ---
After a quiet morning, it looks like the markets have woken up. A few nice opportunities so far this afternoon. I hope you all have managed to catch a move or three!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
looks like it gave some nice aud,eur longs from lower prices

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Wasn't able to trade from late yesterday or early today, looks like the AUD-USD had great move, see some pin bars on regular 1 H, 4 H &amp; Daily chart On this chart, I swiched to Nexas set up with 20, 60 &amp; 100 MA with the 200 in there for good measure Also, trade signals from iTradeAIMS indicator Also, looks to have hit the lower ADR according to indicator, but anything can happen when Europe &amp; London opens, or news comes from big meeting... PS - having typed that, looks like it is continue lower, wait for next pullback I suppose

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Here is how I position a vertical line to track the start of today, as in 00:00 hours, you can make it any time you want but as we know, range bars are not about time - but I do like to look at the day's action in terms of what has gone on today, you will also see that I plot a HIGH and LOW line as we know these are important areas.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
several really nice sells..on 4rg..1) @8:17:37amEST..1st 4bar + pback ..after the 20/60/100 ema stack...trader could have held the trade thru the 8:30 USA trade Balance report..since it was profitable going into the report..if you do have a lead going into a report..just tighten the trailing stop to prevent huge whipsaw.. good for 37tick+ potential..depending on how it was managed....2)8:49;02..nice tline break..with proper stack for a continuation sell...good for 29 ticks+ depending on how managed....3)8:57:38amEDT..good for 12i ..depending on how managed...when you see progressively lower runs..its time to very very skeptical as the symmetry of move continues to shrink.....and sure enough that was it for that leg down..so after 3 runs ..be on guard for more..although the market will do what its going to do..I'm not a big Elliot wave guy but the wave ideas are a good rule of thumb

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I just finished reading the thread and I really like what you're doing here. I'm often scouring the Factory for range bars threads these days and it's nice to see one that combines the RBs with dead simple KISS trading. I've been dabbling in range bars myself for a couple years now but have only been using them in a very active fashion for my entries in the past couple months. M1 was my preferred entry method of choice for a long time but it seems unlikely I'll ever go back to using that alone as a range bar chart can really clear up some of the issues with time-based charting. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on the thread. Not sure if I'll be posting much or not as I mostly use 5RBs and I also use them for all types of trades whether counter-trend, range extremes, trends, or highly volatile markets. The thing I like about this thread is that it keeps it simple with basic breaks in trending markets so I wouldn't want to start steering things away from that. Lastly, I'll just say that there's some good newbie advice in here to go along with the KISS approach. You (Nexas) and kipr seem to have a strong understanding of the markets and a willingness to help people out which is great to see. I'm happy to give you both your first vouches.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I'd agree with that, and hand out a couple of vouches as well

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Auron, First of all thank you for the vouches, I didn't know there was such a thing until you mentioned it and then I did a bit of research, but thank you very much it means a lot! With regards to range bars, for me they are the best thing since sliced bread! Really I couldn't imagine not having them as part of my arsenal. I remember when I first discovered them I likened the event to the film the Matrix when Neo finally starts to "see"... and he doesn't just see people and object but the code behind it. That is how I felt after finding and trading range bars. I know I won't be able to make money every trade or even every day but I do know that as long as I stick to my plan and follow the price I will be profitable over the long haul which is what is important. But please feel free to post here, Kipr and I both trade slightly differently or at least different instruments but I think the input from the both of us is beneficial to the new traders so they see two different points of view, so if you feel you can help as well, please feel free to chime in from time to time. Thanks Again Nexas

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Medici, Thank you for your vouch as well! From someone with your standing in this community it is a real honour. I hope you drop by more often. Nexas

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi Erebus, Don't worry we all feel like that at one time or another, but the beauty with this style of trading is that the next great move is never very far away! Keep up the good work! Nexas

--- 帖子 #205 ---
goes to show u can make some pips without fancy indicators or candlestick patterns. there are many threads with these 'indicators' or candlestick patterns(which are mainly time based) and from personal experience the patterns work and sometimes dont work at all. with this all we need are a few tools. we dont gain any advantage with indicator which lag price, all we need is simple tools(moving average, support/resistance, trend lines, bollinger bands possibly, divergence) to help us see the trend a bit better.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi Kipr, Its funny you handle economic announcements the same way as I do. If I have some on the table then sometimes I just take a punt and tighten up my stop... worst case I go out at be or a little profit, best case I get paid very handsomely! It was indeed a very nice days trading. There were a few losses but the winners clearly outweighed the losses. The second trade this morning actually needed two bites at the cherry, so there was one loss before the winner there. I hope you are all getting to grips with this! Nexas

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Indeed... keeping it simple is definitely the best way forward! I know that you can make money other ways but for me this is the least stressful and less stress is always a good thing. Nexas

--- 帖子 #208 ---
The only problem I find with using a sloping trend line on a chart is that there's no consistency on how to draw them, unless you draw a horizontal line.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
re i notice the last one short was a loss, but as it was late in the trend, it wouldn't have really qualified for a trade

--- 帖子 #210 ---
This post is from my heart..1st thank you Nexas for sharing ...There is something outstanding about a persons character when they are willing to share and help others......sharing and learning they seem to be good partners.. 2nd...I would like to thank Auron112 and Medici..for the vouchers(embarrassingly enough) I didnt know they existed..and have also read up on them..so to receive them from ya'll is very much appreciated..I will soon figure out how to get my charts posted on here( i know I'm an idiot).....but my real goal is to try to help other traders in this crazy but great business of trading..I learn from others always with an open mind..and helping is 1 way of showing gratitude....so again a humble thank you to....Auron112 and Medici

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi Musashi, I understand what you are saying but unfortunately there is no way around that. As you watch the markets you gain experience and learn to identify what looks right and slowly with time you become more consistent in identifying the better setups. For me day trading is more of an art than a science. At least for me I find trend lines to be a good tool and wouldn't be without them. Nexas

--- 帖子 #212 ---
This is true but unfortunately the market presented the opportunity and I took it and would do again :-) Of course you can wave count but its really swings and roundabouts, some times it keeps you out of losers and others winners...

--- 帖子 #213 ---
hi nexas. yes you are right. that could've been another winner, just like in the first picture, the last one was a large winner. so u are potentially missing out on large winner, small winner or a potential stop loss if not taking trade, those are the only 3 potential outcomes. with good Money management, it may be wise to keep trading, when losses come, just move on to next setup

--- 帖子 #214 ---
This is priceless! An actual interview with one of my heroes... Marty Schwartz! http://www.yousaytoo.com/marty-schwa...ew-1999/855943 You will need to have RealPlayer to open the file, but it is a free download.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Nexas..appreciate the Marty Schwartz interview...very insightful..of course its outdated in regard to Globex influence etc..and certainly we have the current market volatility..factors (more so now) than He was experiencing back in 1999...but some key things..he said were to use your words "priceless'..of particular note ..you have to have the guts to pull the trigger..that is why we use the stops..if your wrong you take a small loss..its not an ego thing of having to be "right" all the time.. when your wrong your wrong ..either get out or get stopped ..no biggie....he also mentioned "about " shifting gears' analogy....For me I never reverse a position..i like to re-evaluate..after a trade and reflect for a moment..before getting back into the "arena'..makes me observe the market more clearly..i am a scalper by nature also..so its important for a trader to recognize their own "temperament"..for others that might not be the better approach ....again thanks for digging that interview up..really enjoyed it..thanks

not much setup on euro. however if one simply added aud to their watchlist there were 4-5 setups already in asia using nexas strategy

--- 帖子 #217 ---
i appreciate this strategy. i banked a positive trade out of euro just then. my first live account positive trade(too many negative trades previously). this suggests the system is easy to use and is making me less confused.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Its been a good morning for me so far with 2 winners and a loss. Both my winners were twice as big as my loss so good risk rewards as well. I also missed two further winners...

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Nice going there Halba, slowly but surely the picture should start to get clearer!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
yup i missed some of the other winners bcoz of dinner. i will have my laptop with me whilst im eating next time due to time zone difference, atleast i know this works, there was also a large winner on GBP as well but it seems eur is giving adequate pips. i have 3 on my screen AUD EUR AND GBP that is enough. trade safe with the trend thats the gist of it

Hi Nexus, Do you look for confluence of the EMAs between the 4 and 8 Rbar charts? Do you ever take a counter trend trade on the 4? Say the 8 Emas are showing short but the 4 emas are stacked long? P.S. question is open for others also! Thanks

--- 帖子 #222 ---
krmo...I take divergences frequently although it is not part of this Nexas trend following system..I took a sell6:15:16 amEST..off 4 rg..i like divergences as a return to the mean type trade..but for me to judge them I need the BBands..and some kind of oscillator..i prefer the macd 4/5/13 quick setting..and BBands the std 2/20..the price action "positioning" in reference to the BB envelope and the combined with the macd diverg ..create a disticntive pattern that I have learned to recognize..being that is is a ctrend trade I have tighter targets and also tightening the trailing stop to protect runner profit quicker than if I were trend trading..it is supposedly a higher risk trade ..and probably not a set-up that a less experience trader would even want to bother with..but as you can see this trade worked for a nice gain.Divergence trading is not for the faint of heart..but can be very profitable ..as we know that markets "exhaust" themselves..often creating nice opportunities

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I came out down for the morning... the market has not been very nice to me today :-(

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Krmo, Yes I do sometimes take a long on the 4 whilst the 8 is showing short but I would judge it on the momentum. I do prefer that both charts are pointing in the same direction though. Perhaps I wouldn't have taken the losses I did this morning if I stuck to that little rule.. but then again it is swings and roundabouts. Here's to the US session :-) Nexas

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I managed to drag myself back to break even for the day The markets are slow and have been all day so on that note... I am done for the day

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Nexas ..you clawed your way back to even..which is a good thing.....we did have nice sell signal shortly after you called it a day...a good sell on the 4rg..@10:23:20amEST..simple 4 bar uback..I have noticed that very often the 1st good pback after the ema's stack properly is often a good trade..in this example I had the 20 below the 60 below the 100ema.. right in that time zone.. for the 1st time in the cycle..and price got flushed down the toilet..for a real nice move..there was another nice sell @10:40;03amEST.. if the trader missed the 1st move mentioned above...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
market gave some stop hunting for those short, only to crash later after the stop hunts were removed. its a tricky market. those who had SL were removed, wider SL people enjoyed the later move down the key is SL positions or patient people knowing of potential stop hunts always a strong possibility as the market was heavily short

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi Kipr, Thankfully, I managed to bag myself some additional profits... When I saw the momentum I couldn't resist. I was lucky really though because I was very close to going flying for the rest of the afternoon, but unfortunately the weather was a little too severe... It was a tough day though, and the lesson has to be to continue to take the setups when they are valid and if you haven't exceeded your daily SL, because had I given in this morning I would have ended with a loss whereas instead I made a nice profit. We never know when the move is going to happen which is why I don't like watching too many instruments. Nexas

--- 帖子 #229 ---
hi i seem to be learning new things. there was another asia stop hunt before retrace back to support levels for the major pairs. yes you must take the setup when valid on the 4 and 8 range. sometimes they break out hundreds of pips as they did this week. sometimes they will just SL you out , so just get ready for the next one after large moves, it is high risk now to go both short and long, as longs are risky due to bearish sentiment, and shorts are risky already fallen and vulnerable to short covering spikes scalping might be a better option

--- 帖子 #230 ---
very tight action so far..market feels heavy to me..but we got to trade em as we see em..buy @ 4:59;27amEDT..4rg..pback.. with 20/60/100 stack ..covered on red candle5:03:36...we are near some levels not seen since last mid Dec...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
this range bar does not load....

--- 帖子 #232 ---
is it not the case that in a ranging market you will get slaughtered using this system ? it only works when there is a trend to trade the pullbacks. when ranging you will get stopped out on every pullback entry... i would like to know how you would deal with that.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
whatfx....1st I would ask how big is the range if it is indeed a ranging market?... cause if it is a tight range ..then you probably wont get any signals to begin with..as the ema's stacking doesn't take place...if it is a wider ranging market then there is the opp to get some winners....which is why the 4bar pback minimum is a good rule of thumb..as in a tight range you wont see that very often..by the nature of the 20/60/100 ema's ..if they stack properly that should define "if the range" is wide enough to trade....really really study the charts and you will see this effect..so nexas' approach can work in wider range markets or in trending markets..and will probably keep you out of narrow ranging markets..but again this or any other approach is not the " holy grail" the holy grail is how effectively you read the charts

--- 帖子 #234 ---
good example of a nice 4rg..break of tline in a "narrow range"..10:43:18amEST..the 20/60/100 stack was still in effect..but the 20 had gone up to the 60 BUT did not cross the 60....so markets expand ..and contract ..1st out at 4(to buy some wiggle room)..and 34 on runner..cover on pback..with tight trailing stop

--- 帖子 #235 ---
can someone post a good working range bar indi

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi to everyone. Now I'm papertrading this system with a demo account with dukascopy. I explain this because this broker has range bar charts and a very low spreads .

--- 帖子 #237 ---
wish you good trading during your "papertrading' work...as a reminder..only papertrade..exactly as you would with real $$.. meaning # of contracts..etc..or it is a waste of time

--- 帖子 #238 ---
hi jordi. all mt4 broker can have range bar see post #25, and dukascopy is not the best spread, the best spread on the majors is pepperstone my AUD/USD spread is as low as 0.2 pip during london re = can work in ranging market just go counter trend and play S&amp;R and ignore flag break

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Halba..you are correct..there is more than 1 way to skin a cat..that is a good scalp technique you mentioned

--- 帖子 #240 ---
yep. just wait for price to approach intraday resistance for example eg. on 1minute or 4 range chart. wait for a confirmed bounce off the resistance (suggests it is indeed will be repelled) and go short. scalp some pips. attached is an example. this is a technique from another site - strategy here - it is a 'scalping' strategy . http://www.fxtsp.com/trading-strateg...x-scalper.html keep stop above the candlestick high see picture for 6 potential opportunities on aud/usd pair, any of those 6 would've yielded good pips. as asia session unlikely to get major breakout until london/new york. there were a few long entries also, but these were risky as daily chart was down. keep it simple, no flag drawing. dont wait for any indicators to confirm as they are too laggy- just use the chart. the indicators below are for different system. http://i.imgur.com/CQxHp.gif

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi Halba, I've never said that dukascopy has the best spread, i've only suggested an alternative to metatrader and ninjatrader.

Hi All, I hope you have all had a good week... I have had a tough couple of days. NOt sure whether it is the Christmas season that is distracting me or just that the markets are out to get me but something is going a miss lol Anyhow I have managed to hover a round break even so not to much of a disaster, just frustrating... but you know what... that is trading for you! Nothing you can do to get away from it... We just have to take the next trade! Nexas

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Nexas you have a good attitude..when we churn our accounts..it feels like a drawdown..,,mentally..I have noticed that since we are in such a big picture trend down..that when we do get a positive stack..20 above the 60 above the 100..that the price action can create a quick snapback so therefor right now I am more apt to take profits quickly against the big picture trend..which to me is clearly hammer down for now....that being said I took a 4 rg buy @ 7:31;09amEST..18 total ticks on 2lot..covered into oscillator diverg..and took a buy @7:48:26amEST..t-line break..19 ticks 2 lot...and covered too quickly again wanting to lock profit quickly due to market condition..

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yup it is indeed in a huge down trend... I managed to crawl back into positive territory for the week, which I am taking as a little victory after the week I have had so far :-) You had a good week so far kipr?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Nexas ..i've done okay no real world beaters....been pretty quick to take profits as seems like every other minute there is another piece of dynamic news coming out of the IMF..EFSf..ECB..all the finance ministers..and the rest of the world idiots..gees what a friggin mess..but with all that stuff that jerks the charts around ..I've been trigger happy to lock profits....but hey can you blame me

--- 帖子 #246 ---
No I can't I think you have done the right thing... I am back in positive territory for the week now which is good. It has been a little rough but as long as you persist you will be ok in the end!

--- 帖子 #247 ---
good deal Nexas....happy for ya..sometimes clawing ,,scratching, and fighting back slowly is a good strategy..1 thing I learned tho..thru the school of hard knocks ..dont swing for the fence or try to get it back all at once ..just keep betting small and..the law of probabilites, based on a robust trade plan..and consistant execution is the best medicine

ROFL!!!!!!! That tickled me :-) Yah swinging for the fences to make it all back is definitely not the way to go, as your strike rate decreases and you end up compounding your losses. Often it is better just hitting singles until you get your mojo back.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
if you miss big moves, you will get whipped. anyway an inexperienced trader like me made 5/5 trade this week so this can be done i use range bar charts for my trigger first, but stick to m1,m5 for entry tips - need to increase tp profit target a little more, all my trade ran further before bouncing

Range Bars are great for the visual learner. One of the beauties of trading Range Bars is that you can tweak the size of the bars to fit the specific rhythm of each instrument. And they can be used not only for scalping, with larger bars and larger SLs and TPs. Here is a 20 pip bar chart for the EU.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
only issue larger bars give absolutely nothing in terms of trade signals during a ranging market condition, however it gave some nice signals above

--- 帖子 #255 ---
You still get signals; they aren't as good and need filtering. Here is a fuller picture.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
The markets just want to annoy me this week :-) Not moving anywhere! Two trades this morning so far... one winner and one loser, but a net profit result.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi Nexas Perhaps my only concern with using Range Bars is the gap between the close of one bar and the open of the next bar. I think the theory is that the next tick past the range bar size should trigger the open of the new bar, but at times this gap seems to have had a minimum size of 1 pip on the range bar script I use, although not always. This has the effect of adding to your costs. Is this the same with the range bars on Ninja Trader? If so, do you take any measures to compensate? I use orders on my spreadbetting account which is feasible with large range bars, but with a minimum distance of 5 pips between the price and an order I wouldn't be able to do this using 4 pip bars. I'd be interested in your views.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
not much happening here nexas either . there was a clear winner of AUd @ resistance, my fat finger at it again!! you got to be quick though, only a few seconds reaction time - spinning top clear short for 30 pips

--- 帖子 #259 ---
That is the correct behaviour, a new bar is only created once a the range has been exceeded. Yes I know you could talk about fractional pips but, to be honest it makes no odds to me. I only enter once you get a break of 1 pip anyway. I use market orders as I like to be in front of the screen when my trades are on and ready :-)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Nice trade Halba! Its nice to see you are doing well! I couldn't trade half as profitably as I do trading just time based charts! Range bars all the way!!!!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Agreed. Happy to see a thread dedicated to RBs with some valuable contributions. I thought I'd share my current setup, in case somebody would find it valuable. Nexas, apologies if I am going outside of your intended thread focus here. If so, let me know. My setup today was with RB5 and three MAs (8, 17, 30) and with a 20 pip band around the 30MA. Entries would be with a 7 pip hard SL, and a target of ideally 15+ but 10 would do on a morning like this. Using this setup there were quite a few pips to be had this morning...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi Medici, what is your entry trigger? Touch of the band? Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Generally close of candle, but there are exceptions to the rule.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
there is a similar concept here- is it the same idea? simple is always good http://www.fxtsp.com/trading-strateg...-strategy.html it is a scalping one.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Similar perhaps. But, yes, I'd be happy to do a few 15 pip trades for the daily harvest. Then, on other occasions, holding or longer is the way to go. It all depends, and generally speaking trade management is the key to profitability - entry is easy, exit is hard, so to speak.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
good post Halba...I use BB on every chart..for me they help frame the price action.... ..go to John Bollinger website and get a copy of the 22 ways to trade BBands..I have seen his presentation on this topic..and its very good material

--- 帖子 #267 ---
only issue with BB is the repainting . if price breaks BB, it will continue to expand to allow the price expansion. at the moment i dont use it, its a bit laggy indicator. i prefer bounces of S&amp;R or S&amp;D - just macd and stoch i use. heres a good chart .missed because was asleep. as you can see my trade timezone - nothing happened so i didnt do much. i only do intraday trade, no swing or limit orders as anything can happen. clear setup for 60+ pips, short, background is short. just go short anywhere near failed test of resistance. sorry no range bar as diff pc . there was also a long earlier closer to 1.30(failed break of support) all the way to 1.3042. system : http://www.fxtsp.com/trading-strateg...x-scalper.html http://i.imgur.com/fza8s.gif another example AUD - pinbar @ S&amp;D level 1.0015, bearish in daily, bad fundamental: it dropped max 69 pips from this level. but 30 pip was obtainable immediate. on the 1minute, more pips, because more precise entry but had to be fast. the top later i was asleep. system for this below here: http://www.fxtsp.com/trading-strateg...-strategy.html http://i.imgur.com/9VjUP.gif

Hi, I did not post much charts in the last days but I had plenty of winners...here is my latest one...+22 pips win with a 7 pip risk !! PS: Should have hold the trade a little longer...price still going up like crazy...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Well done Olarion. It's easy to see with hindsight that you could have held the trade longer, with the absence of upper wicks an indication of a strong trend, but your R/R ratio was still good and it's always good to see pips banked. Yesterday was a good day for 8 pip Range Bars trades, with the rally and the reversal;

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi All, Its nice to see you are all active and doing well! I haven't really done too much, just getting ready for Christmas and and all that stuff :-) @Olarion - Are you starting to find your consistency now? Nexas

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Nexas, yes, it seems that I'm able to bank consistent profits...at least for the last 3 weeks. Next weeks/months will show of course if it goes on like this. If not, it might not be the systems fault...everyone knows about greed/fear etc... I trade your system exactly as you described, mainly on the 4 range. I only added some round numbers and daily pivots to filter out some bad entries sometimes. Anyway, thanks for this wonderful system. And have a Merry Christmas! Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I can clearly see the s-Constant Range Bars EA smiley face on this chart, telling me that you are running the EA, and in Live Trading mode. Are you unsure as to how to use it correctly?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi Nexas I now realise that Ninja Trader is a 4 digit broker, so my point was meaningless to you. I use a 5 digit broker, which is why I posed the question. Merry Christmas to you and all successful range bar traders.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
not much happening. theres 99% ranging, and for a few short bursts it trends.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Everyone! Happy New Year!!!!! I hope you all had a good holiday and are ready for 2012! Expect the markets to be a little thin, at least for this first week anyway so only take perfect setups. Anything that looks a little suspect probably is :-) I look forward to taking it to the next level in 2012! Nexas

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi Everyone, Well it was a nice start to the year today with lots of opportunities to take profit. I hope you all managed to bag a few. By the way I thought I would let you all know that over the Christmas period I analysed my trades and have found that even though trading from the 4 range as the primary chart is definitely profitable, my strike rate would have increased had I only traded 8 range setups. Now that doesn't mean don't trade the 4 range, far from it... what it means is that if I only traded in the direction of the 8 range I would be MORE profitable. So I can get early entries off the 4 range and then add when then 8 range confirms. You may ask why I did look at my trading... and the answer is the book "One Good Trade" by one of the guys at the prop firm SMB in the US. In it they talk about how they train their traders and the underlying theme is constant self improvement. So to get to the next level in trading you need to keep eliminating what isn't working as well and do more of what is. So this got me thinking, is there a way to improve what I already have? I know if it ain't broke don't fix it... but I thought to help myself I at least need to see. So thats what I did and that is what I found. I hope that doesn't dishearten anyone as I am not saying just trading the 4 range isn't profitable, I am merely saying that it seems that we can be even more profitable by doing more of the good stuff. In fact that is my trading resolution for this year, to be more humble and accept that no matter how successful you are or how good your system is, there is always something you can do to improve. Whether it be system wise or psychology or what ever. If these guys with 2 decades experience believe it is important then I sure should give it a try. So in 2012 I am going to add a video diary as suggested in the book and see if that also helps improve my trading. If you guys like and if I believe it is helping me I can find a way to upload them here to for all of you to see? So again, please be positive about this post and don't read into it that I am changing my system. I am NOT, I am merely embarking on an adventure of self improvement! Nexas

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Good approach and good book In my own testing, the hit rate improved significantly just by upping the range to 5 pips, and I now use that range only.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hey Nexas I, for one, would love to see a few videos. I don't post much here because I don't think I can add much to the discussion but this is one of my favorite threads and I think some videos would really push it to the next level. Thanks. Mark

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I folloved this thread for quite a long time and I must thanks every one that contributed so far in Intraday Range Bar Trading thread. It realy helps me in my first setup of daily trade this year. In the attachmet is my daily "Trade Of The Day" for 4. january 2012:

--- 帖子 #280 ---
hi grande. your method looks a lot different to nexas. care to highlight it . thanks.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Kipr, I was wondering about your entry method you posted. I can't figure out how you use the %R along with a trend line break. It seems that once the trendline breaks on a higher time frame you will no longer be ob/os on the %R. Do enter differently than how I am understanding it? btw, Georgia is nice. Spent some time in Athens. Thanks

--- 帖子 #282 ---
GrandeACM.., No offense, but i think what you are showing as 124 pips is 12.4 pips in real counting terms.., coz my chart did not show 124 pip movement... .

--- 帖子 #283 ---
It is true and corect movement of real counting terms for my yesterday "Trade Of The Day". I have my trade account with 5 digit broker and the trade vas actually big for 124 pips, belive it or not. I get IN position with SELL EUR/USD at quote 1.3043(0) at time 11:09 CET and I get OUT of position with BUY EUR/USD at quote 1.2919(0) at time 17:12 CET You can check those quotes and times on any chart, but I thing you must adjust the clock for jour time in India, which is about 5 or 6 hours difference to our Centrac European Time (CET) zone.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi All, Nice morning in the markets this morning. I hope you guys managed to jump on board with some of the moves. I have had to alter my instruments slightly to take advantage of the 0 spreads that I get with my platform as they decided to add and remove instruments. Not happy about that as they removed the Dax which I was really enjoying trading. Perhaps I will have to go back to IB or someone similar to trade the Dax although it is quite a big contract to hold in the futures. So anyway of course the EURUSD is still there but I am now more active with the AUDUSD and FTSE100 with the S&amp;P in the background. Nexas

GrandeACM, Our relationship could get off to a really bad start if you beat us in the Champions League :-) Nexas

hi nexas. id look at Xauusd and crude oil instead of the indices. some of the instruments fell too quick and didnt consolidate enough to use this method today. maybe thats just me but i prefer retracement. thanks for your video. ill keep working at it.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Nexas, great video, very well explained! Have saved it and will shortly watch it again. Had 2 trades today, 2 winners (on the 4 range). Will try to apply your new rule of trading into the direction of the 8 range only, starting tomorrow. Wish you many pips and a nice evening.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
usually after a large trend it ranges(most of the time). this is my own observation. if it continued to trend one direction, it would be worth nothing after a while. also big players like to keep it ranging for a bit. this method will keep out in ranging market due to the M/As. it is better to use other strategies in a ranging market e.g. counter trend with this method, just ignore M/As and use traditional stop loss incase it trends.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hey Olarion, Thanks :-) The 8 range thing is a personal choice, so please only use my updated rules if they make sense to you to. As I said the 4 range is still more than profitable, but I am just trying to improve on the strike rate. Nexas

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi Halba, Thanks for the heads up. The instruments I am trading are driven not only by the market movement but also by the cost of trading. With my platform I get zero spreads on what I am trading which makes things a little easier. Nexas

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Halba, Its a fair point but you don't really need to have a ranging strategy as well. You just need to get good at one approach and you will be able to make money. Especially on such a short term chart. You just need to learn how to limit your losses during the ranging markets. Does that make sense? Nexas

--- 帖子 #295 ---
or just allow the M/As, other things to keep you out, and just retake setups when it trends

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi Nexas Just wanted to say thanks for the video. I hope it helps you improve your trading as much as I think it will help alot of other people. You're doing really good and I only hope to get to the level you're at now at some point in the near future. I really believe you only need one good setup and as long as you have enough opportunity to apply it, you can make some good money. Thanks again. Mark

--- 帖子 #297 ---
i agree, trade the setup, but avoid the junk! always in the market, it feeds u with junk setups also , and they can be filtered, some of them wont. really good video nexas. goes to show its not requiring einstein brains. its one of the best videos on youtube on forex, because its so clear. just go with trend, and take the SL's, even creator of this method gets a few. TP - you can get better TP if u use multiple lot entries and let some ride at BE SL.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Another good day trading! Overall a very positive start to the New Year. The NFP provided some really nice movements. I hope you all managed to grab some!

couldnt get anything during my time zone nexas(sydney) as market did not trend until late european session, and in american session it dropped heaps. anyway good video. i notice you are an aggressive trader and i think tightish stops might work for your 'scalping' type strategy. some clear winners there.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi Halba, I guess I am a little aggressive although not as aggressive as I could be. Perhaps I am somewhere in between. Ultimately one of my goals for 2012 is take a slight step back and take mainly the best setups, which should increase my strike rate and hence allow me to take larger positions. As mentioned I am really going to be taking my lead from the 8 range and use the 4 range for early entries and then add when the 8 range confirms. Hows your trading going? Nexas

--- 帖子 #302 ---
hi nexas. good energy shown in the trades. possible way to increase hit rate - go for the longer bar retracements, closer to the MA(but not so much MAs all over the place), and take the break of those. and do those on the 8 range chart. having said that, shorter range provided earlier and more accurate entries(and some whipsaws and unprofitable sessions, shorter stop outs) vs longer range provides bigger stop outs but larger profit but less setting up. also using some fundamentals helps -e.g. NFP day, market showed signs of clear ranging, so best to wait until clear trend. w/ longer retracement , better risk reward, trading with the trend. you wont get many trades often. maybe have a few different instruments that trend different and have no cost spread. e.g. add XAUUSD. cmc markets offer 0.3 spread which is nothing. crude oil has a 3.5 point spread which is very little also. taking short retracements and shorting at low areas after already gone down, not much pippage although you can get some runs(as the euro has been bleeding, anytime shorting it has worked, but in the long term may not work like this for all instruments). also you need to constantly retake small pip type trades and have many of them to cover potential stop outs also. when the eurozone issues get fixed a bit, it may not be so lucky to get further declines. my trading is sufferring from what is called 'traders block' like writers block cant get into the trades (i.e. too much fence sitting). you need to be quicker to get into the main moves. but sometimes my fence sitting has helped, during yesterday london morning(asia evening - my time) there was only whipsaw. there was one solid long on AUD and EURUSD which was perfect for a scalp, and would've provided daily target. so market gives opportunities for every session, just need to act on them and be patient. anyway i will remain active and alert, plenty of time.

Nice System, I am still playing around with it and you have to be pretty percise with drawing the trend lines. I have also added a 4 linear weighted close for more gidence. I just draw as many trend lines as per your system , but also draw trend line from the oppisite direction to get support levels.

Just wondering as I know you have to be very quick in and out with such short timeframe trading. This is the reason I like to have" trade through" facility allowing me to trade off my charting program. Regards Simon

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Can I suggest you post a rangebar chart showing your trades and the issues you have, with any of your possible amendments to Nexas' system illustrated, and the difference made to the outcome. That way, Nexas can add his experience and benefit your trading, which is the reason behind this thread.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
No Nexas, just the important ones, I can understand simple, but I can also understand , support and resistance. I was just trying to show support and resistance trend lines. It works better with 8 pip rb. fishman356

Hi Nexas, really great vids, like 'em very much! Coud you tell please how many pips you set your SL above/below the last swing high/low?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Olarion, I set it at 2 pips behind the swing point, but I exit according to the chart so if the price on the chart moves 1 pip beyond then I exit manually. The 2 pip sl is a worst case scenario. Nexas

Nexus Thank you for taking the time to share your strategy with us. The videos are very helpful and simplicity of strategy so wonderful. All the best, Ed

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi Simon, My setup includes 3 screens in total. I run my charts on two of them and on the other I have my platform. So I can simultaneously watch the charts and execute which I guess achieves the trade through that you mention above. Nexas

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Ed, Thanks for your comments. For me a simple system is by far the best system to trade :-) If you need any help, let me know. Nexas

Hi Nexas! Do you know if the same rangebar setting (4/8) apply in the euro 6E futures. Regards PG

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi Pipgeneral, I don't trade it myself but I would assume so. I believe Kipr trades the 6E so he would be the best person to confirm with. But apply it to your chart and see what it looks like. Thanks Nexas

Hi Nexus, Been following your thread for a while, - excellent methodology. Can you please comment om W.S. as a broker. Once they realise that you are profitable, have you had requotes and slippage ? Do you get instant fills ? I'm UK based and thinking of which broker to use. Your videos are very helpful. Thanks

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Voyager, I find them to be very good... so far... Obviously you never know but for me they have been good. You need to make sure you adhere to their terms which states you should be in a trade for no less than 1 minute on average. But apart from the trades off the back of some kind of stimulant (news, etc) I find I am in trades for 5-10 minutes in any case. Nexas

Morning One and All! I didn't manage to trade yesterday, hence no recording and I have a few things on this morning which will prevent me from actively trading, so I will only be taking A+ setups that I see whilst I am in front of my screen which is between now and 9am UK time. I hope you all do well! Nexas

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Nexas.......what exactly is your profit target. I think I read originally that it was to the prior swing low if short and prior swing high if long. It I'm not mistaken, you appear to be going for a fixed target and are now scalping. Is this correct or am I misreading what you're saying and what it appears the profits you're taking on you live trades are less than the previous swing high/low. I like your method very much. Also, it appears for the most part you either hit your target or get hit at your stop. I'm not sure but unless I have you confused, which certainly is possible, you used to get out on lets say an up candle if you were short. Thanks again for all your time you've put into this.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Kadiddle, I am quite agile as a trader. Ultimately my target is the last swing point, but on occassion I will exit early or later depending on what the price action looks like and the momentum in the market. I know that is a little hard to grasp and sometimes that approach can obviously burn you, but when you sit in front of the screen all day you do tend to get a feel for the markets. But if I were to put them into hard rules I would say on a decent pull back exit at the last swing and a breakout trade from a congestion zone should be played with an opposite candle exit. I hope that clears things up. Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi All, Sorry for no video yesterday or the day before but as I mentioned I had other things to tale care of. I will try and get one out tonight. How has everyone been doing? Nexas

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hi Nexas, another video would be great! Got some mixed resuslts, but overall profitable. I should not try to catch some runners, but exit according plan at the last swing point respectively at the color change if the swing point is too near. PS: I am a little worried about the (perhaps) coming transaction tax which would make short-term forex trading not profitable at all. Do you know if the futures market (like Kipr is trading) is also affected? Cheers, Olarion

Hi everyone. I've been lurking for a while and testing. During the US a.m. session, I traded this technique with real $ on EURUSD for the first time (8 pip range). Had a good time. Four trades, four winners at 8:20 EST, 9:14, 9:50, and 11:05 (the five bar rule kept me out of a losing short at 10:27). I've been a full-time trader for five years now and will add this trade to my arsenal. There are a couple of filters (involving a longer-term guide chart) I've found useful in the past that may help this trade's win rate and also the take rate (adds a way to high-percentage scalp in non-trending markets). If it turns out they do, I'll post them. Thanks for sharing this simple but useful technique.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi scjohn............hate to ask a dumb question but what 5 bar rule are you speaking of. Didn't recall seeing that one in this thread. Thanks....Kadiddle PS I've been watching this thread and now I'm using this setup for the Russell TF, Nasdaq NQ, and the Euro futures contract 6E. Although not a great trading day today, it's picked out some good winners and has kept me out of a lot of whipsaws. Slow markets here in the US. Just simming now but will start trading live within the next few days.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Olarion, I don't think you have too much to worry about regarding the transaction tax. Unless Germany are involved I can't see it going through and even though Merkel has said she is interested, she also said it is her personal opinion and she needs the agreement of the coalition which she doesn't have at the moment. In any case I am not sure of exactly what it will or won't affect as of yet. I found that the 4 range has been a little choppy, although it still has been profitable, just a little harder work. The 8 range has been producing better opportunities as we thought it would do. Still trading the two but only taking them in the direction of the 8. I hope that helps. Nexas

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi Scjohn, Thanks for your contribution, please keep us updated. Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Kadiddle, In the original post that started this thread on Nov. 21, Nexas said, "Once we have this momentum we then look for the candles to start to pull back, we need a minimum of 4 candles pullback, this means we cannot enter before the 5th candle opens at a bare minimum." If you look at EURUSD at 10:27, there was a trendline break and all else was in place for the trade but only 4 bars had formed and only 3 were pullbacks. A short taken there would have shorted out. Another way to look at it is the phenomenum of proportional moves. The 10:27 pullback was not proportional to the prior two pullbacks (it was much smaller) and therefore at least somewhat suspect. The "five bar rule," or whatever you want to call it, makes sure the pullback is substantial. It also tends to make the turn coincide with retreats from overbought or oversold levels on the stochastic indicator (settings 3,5,2), which is usually a good thing.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Oops, my earlier post should have read stopped out, not shorted out. No electrical problems.

Oh ok, I realized that. I thought you were requiring another pullback bar, more than the 4. I don't trade the forex but these setups work on the futures just as well.........Kadiddle

Hi Nexas, been following your thread with great interest and taking a few trades. I have watched your 2 vids on youtube and still have a couple of questions for you which need some clarification for me. In the chart below do you enter the trade at the completion of the candle after the trendline break (single arrows)? Would you exit your position at the green candles before reaching the swing low (double candles-trades 2 and 3)? At what point would you move to break even in the following trades? Thanks Pete Attached Image

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Pete, I enter on the open of the candle and not the close. The close would leave too much on the table, for me anyway. I try not to take profits before the swing point although sometimes when momentum fades I will do. The opposite candle rule is one I use when there is momentum or when I am trading a breakout of a congestion zone. Moving stops to breakeven is a difficult game. More often than not your trade will reach its target, so moving the stop to breakeven, you can sometimes end up strangling the trade. Having said that, when I do, it is usually once the trade has reached one to one or a mini S&amp;R. I try not to take trades where the R&amp;R isn't right. Nexas

Many thanks Nexas, will take on board! Cheers from oz Pete

Hi Nexas, In my first post, I mentioned that there are some filters I've used in the past that may be helpful here. While it's still only at the interesting anecdote stage, there were some differences in my trades on Jan. 11 vs. the ones you showed in your most recent video. Please accept these comments in the spirit they are intended -- not criticisms but possible helpful suggestions based on years of experience. I'm on Eastern Standard Time and don't start trading until around 8:15 EST. That's the only reason I missed your first losing trade -- my filter would not have prevented that one. However, the filter did prevent all of the subsequent losing trades and I finished the day with 4 winners and no losers. An expert trader I've learned a lot from uses the stochastic indicator to filter pullback retracements (I know you like to keep things simple, but this has saved my bacon many times in the past). Based on experience, he uses non-standard settings of 3,5,2. The rule is to wait until both stochastic lines have reached overbought (80 for shorts) or oversold (20 for longs) and have also turned in the direction of the trade. Waiting for this to happen prevented all your stopouts after the first one. You can check this out by inserting the stochastics indicator with settings 3,5,2 (Ninjatrader's default settings are 5,2,3 so they'll have to be changed). Remember, both lines have to have changed in the direction of the trade). As I said before, it's way too early to tell if the filter will help more than hinder. On Jan. 11, the filter did not eliminate any winners, but there is not doubt that at times it will keep you out of some winning trades. The question for any filter is whether, over time, it prevents more $ losses than $ wins. It's entirely possible given your good reward to risk ratio that the foregone winners may end up being worth more than the losers. There are far too few instances to know this now (and I have not tried to backtest it yet), but this filter has served me well in the past with other setups and it had an auspicious start at least. Also, and again please don't take this as a criticism as I've done this way more times in the past than I care to remember or will ever admit, but it looks like you ignored one of your rules on the last trade. Your last loss happened after only 3 up bars. In your initial description of your setup you said your required at least 4 bars. Maybe it changed somewhere after that. Again, I'm fairly certain your setup will be profitable as is and it's elegantly simple, but a couple of filters may improve win rate and reduce drawdown without adding onerous complexity.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Both lines crossing below 80 for a short scjohn?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
HI Scjohn. Thank you for your post. It sounds interesting and is definitely something I will look at to see if it improves the system. So let me see if I understand what you are saying (I have never really used indicators). We wait until both lines have moved into overbought or oversold territories and then only enter once they both cross back across the lines? Do they need to be lined up in order as well? Regarding my 4 bar rule. I think I should clarify... what I mean is that I will not enter before the 5th bar, so I won't enter after 2 greens and then 1 red, but I would be happy to enter after 3 greens and 1 red because that would mean I am entering on the 5th bar. Does that make more sense? Sorry if I confused you all. Nexas

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Both stochastic lines don't need to have crossed back over the OB/OS lines, just pointing in the right direction. However, by waiting for both the trendline cross and directional change, they are very likely to have both crossed the lines. Nexas, I did misread your original description. When you said 4 bars of pullback, I assumed all 4 had to be in the pullback direction (i.e., all greens when pulling back in the long direction and vice-versa). Bad assumption on my part. By the way, as I said, the jury's still out on the filter. Although this filter has worked for me in the past on other setups and yesterday, it may end up not being net helpful in this particular setup. In fact, today it would have kept you out of two winning trades at 9:50 and 10:03 EST. Filters giveth and filters taketh away. However, today I was only trading the big news surprises. Few indicators or filters work after huge news. With the unexpected very bad news re U.S. retail sales and unemployment claims, I was in news mode, which is typically to trade in the direction of the news (which today meant be long EURUSD) and then hold on for dear life. So, the filters didn't hurt me today because at 9:50 and 10:03 I was still long since 8:42. Did have to watch out for the central pivot point today (which is the only pivot point I pay much attention to) as EURUSD was pretty close to it when the news hit. Caused a bit of congestion and chop at first, then took off to the moon. Good day for runners. Also a good day to show the power of the central pivot as, right after the news, EURUSD first had to go down a bit to touch the pivot before taking off in the direction it wanted to go.

Hello everyone, I just wanted to post something so that I can no longer be called a lurker on this thread. I have been following along, rather intently since the new year and I am very interested with your methodology here, Nexas. I was introduced to range bars through a trading club that was using them. I had mixed results when I was using the method they used, but I was intrigued by the range bars and the way they seemed to filter out some of the noise that was a big part of trading shorter time frames. I have a Ninja Trader platform and I have been trying to find a way to incorporate the range bars into my trading. I think this is a viable option for me, as it seems to be very promising. I too am in the US Eastern time zone, as SCJohn and thus trade the NY session. I also have traded many indicators, oscillators, and such and have used different methods for filtering my trades. Unfortunately, I have been mostly unsuccessful in finding the right ones and that is part of what brought me here. I like the simplicity of this and the structure (Discipline has been a big part of my failure in the past). It is very clear-cut and there is not much left to my discretion. Stops and such are very clear. If I were to add anything to what you have here it would be just that I have found levels to be rather important (ie. pivots, support, resistance and round numbers). I have taken some of those into consideration when testing this methodology. If, for instance, there is an R1 just above the recent high that you use as a target, I will use the R1 instead, as the price tends to go to these like magnets. Sometimes it goes flying through them and sometimes comes up short but it often works for me. Overall, I am impressed with the results I am having here and thank you for sharing and putting in the time to post. I know it is not easy to find time to do this. You are truly paying it forward. THANKS! Oh, and by the way, the lead-in for your video today was very impressive. Looked like something that Dreamworks or some other big Hollywood production company would have. Keep up the great work and good trading everyone! Cheers,

Hello all, I have also decided to reveal myself from the darkness behind the screen J . I am still being a slave to the System (office worker), however this is going to change soon this way or another as they are laying off the staff and I will be the next to go coz they screwed too many big things up. But no matter how much I hate the way the whole world works (or doesn’t), I am proud of and thankful to this country for many reasons and will never ever forever and ever go claim anything. Ever. I do not have much live experience as I work for 10-11 hours a day (UK), come back home very late, put my baby daughter to sleep, then read, learn, backtest the day, week, month, use different setups, simulators, control emotions, discipline, etc until I collapse. Rinse and repeat. This is why I choose to become a full time intraday trader. Don’t have much working capital, but £2000-£3000 (half of my savings) should suffice. I will start as soon as the System will say no longer needs me. YES! And when I think about the FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Khem, anyway...err… many thanks to Nexas… well, actually to all of you who noticed he has something special to share and respect him for that and all his kind help (I see that from your posts lol), I have confidence that it will work out for me as well. Let’s see what the future holds for us. No fear, no greed, no revenge, no hoping, no wishing, but (only thankful) praying allowed J .

Hi Swingdjpj, Thanks for your post. You are right the simplicity is what makes this system work, and I wouldn't have it any other way :-) Interesting about the pivots though. Which pivots do you use and what time of day do you consider the open/close? Nexas

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Krisdetrader, Wow you have a lot on at the moment :-) I hope it all works out for you! What I might suggest if you have fairly limited hours in the day to trade is look at something like a 50 range chart and trade the same approach as we are on the shorter term time frame but just on your longer term 50 range. Let me know what you think. Nexas

Hi Nexas, Congrats on a nice trading day. I'm still impressed with your methodology and its simplicity. Using the 8 range bar as a guide chart for 4 range bar entries gives you an excellent reward/risk ratio. Do you ever keep a partial runner or do you always exit 100% at the swing point? Especially yesterday with the news winds at their backs, some of your trades went up for a long time. Something else to consider. Your 8 range bar trade stopout at 13:14. There was big news scheduled at 13:30 (US retail sales, unemployment claims, and an ECB press conference). Usually wise to wait for big news when that close timewise. Also, at that time price was just above the central pivot point (1.2717 on that day) which very frequently acts like a black hole and pulls price to it. It indeed did that as, even though the news was such that wanted to push EURUSD up, it first went down to visit the central pivot before roaring upward. I'm not trying to add undue complexity but as Einstein said, "A scientific theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpler."

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi SCJohn, I'm trading the emini futures so I don't have access to the forex charts but my guess the losers that Nexas had on his charts from a couple of days ago and you said using the stochastic they weren't trades, were probably 4 bar pull backs that didn't get you stoch. ob/os. I think when the trigger is pulled by Nexas your stoch are probably both turning in the direction of the trade. If this is the situation, the easy way of over coming this without adding a stoch. is to simply require a 5 or 6 bar pullback before considering entry. The big question is by waiting longer are you missing a lot more winning trades by eliminating a few losers. The winners are much bigger so by eliminating them, you could actually be hurting yourself. Only time will tell..........Kadiddle

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I've been doing a bit more work on the stochastic filter I talked about earlier. The jury's still out. I'm now almost certain it will increase win rate. However, because of its potential effect on trade size (given a fixed $ risk per trade) it may actually reduce long term profitability. I've seen this in a lot of filters -- win rate goes up but profits go down. Should know in a few days and I'll post it when I do.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Kadiddle, I did not see your post before I wrote mine. You're almost certain not to eliminate winners with the stochastic filter as all winning trades would have to go through a stage where both stochastics point in the right direction. However, losing trades do not have to go through this stage so some would be eliminated. The bigger problem is the effect on trade size by waiting for this to happen. By waiting, trade sizes are smaller (again assuming fixed $ risk) and wins are smaller. So, the question is which produces the most $. The filter will surely increase win rate but, as my previous post says, could actually reduce $, but not because of foregone winners. Won't know till I have more data but, if the $ results are very close, it would be better to ignore the filter in the interest of simplicity.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hey Nexas On your journal video, why would you take your last trade on the 8 range after you had just been stopped out?..........the MA had curled down You had ignored your last 4 range entry for this reason thanks Just realised the last trades on your 8 range chart looks to be the same point as your last 4 range trade,but you give it as a different time? ......... 3.10 and 2.24?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
scjohn.......the winning trades you would miss with the stoch are those trades that are winners, due to the 4 bar retracement, but don't reach your ob/os areas, thus you'd never be in the winning trade if I understand what your're saying.......kadiddle

--- 帖子 #352 ---
You're right. That's the only way you'd miss a winning trade -- never get to ob/os. That's what happened in yesterday's potential two missed trades that I mentioned in my Jan. 12 post. However, once you do reach ob/os, you can't miss a winning trade as the stochs are sure to turn in the right direction long before you reach the target.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
To me the key is to examine your winners and see how many of them were the result of waiting for a 5 or 6 bar retracement. We know we run into situations where the 4 just aren't enough. But is it that often. When the 4 bar retracement fails, you many times wind up getting back in after another bar or 2 additional in the retracement. Ideally I like eliminating as many losers as I can and if it comes at the cost of some winners so be it.......Kadiddle

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Fourx, With regards to trades I take on the 8 and not on the 4. The 8 range is a stronger chart for me. So I am more willing to take less than perfect entries on the 8 than I am on the 4. The risk to reward on that trade was excellent so even if I am wrong 2 times out of 3 I can sill make money on those trades and it is just a personal choice that I am willing to take those trades. Does that make sense. I am a little confused by your last comment? Let me know if you need more explanation. Nexas

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi Scjohn, Thank you for the input, I do look at the announcements but sometimes get a little aggressive as I am usually only in a trade for 10 mins or so. :-) Nexas

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Kadiddle, Can I offer you some advice please? If I am wrong I am sorry :-) You sound a little like you about to embark on a journey that most newbies do, and it rarely ends well and at best costs you a lot of time. You really can't avoid losers in this game and over optimizing something can quickly eliminate its edge when a market condition changes. If you over optimize you are forever doing it as conditions always change and different filters come into and out of vogue. Your focus should be your bottom line and not eliminating losers even at the cost of winners. Does that make sense? Nexas

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi Nexas. You certainly aren't offending me. We only know one another from a brief couple of posts and that's hardly enough time to get to know one another. Actually, I'm not a newbie. I've been trading pretty much full time for more than a decade. I've been strictly a short term scalper and I've really tired of jumping in and out on short term trades where your stop loss is larger than your winners. I've been thinking about trading longer term and then stumbled onto this forum. I like very much what you're doing, but in all honesty, I had nor have I any idea as to how long you've been doing this. I know I saw a statement you made and thought maybe this topic was still wide open for input. You said, "Hehe... to be honest, there isn't anything magic behind it, they just seem to work. The 20 was because I reade Pitbull by my hero Marty Schwartz and he uses a 10... but then 10 was little two close so I doubled it. The 60 was from something I read as well but don't recall the source and the 100 just seems to be a bit of an industry standard. I knew what I wanted and that combination worked... but then I would imagine most similar combinations would work just the same... So from this statement you might see where an outsider might think that this method is loosely put together and maybe needed some additional input. I'm probably wrong about that but I thought you were maybe looking for any other outside input. As far as I knew you could have been doing this only for the last month. So I thought I'd throw in some other thoughts which may or may not be helpful. I know all about optimizing, and I'm not looking to do that. But if you've been running with this a long time, and you have been successful with it, and producing real money, then I won't suggest anything else and run with what you're saying. I certainly don't want to reinvent the wheel. Keep up the good work and thanks for all your unselfish efforts.....Kadiddle

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Kadiddle, I am sorry for the assumption In answer to your question, I have been trading since 2005 and trading this way for maybe the last 18 months. I do trade for a living. I started trading this way when the trends on the longer term time frames started to become a little harder to follow due to whipsaws and the fact that fundamentally everyone was in a bad way, so there wasn't the solid fundamental story to follow. One minute the eurozone were screwed the next the US debt ceiling was the issue then back the the ex etc.. With regards to the moving averages, I was just letting everyone know how I came up with them for transparency reasons. So I guess that would indicate that one could possibly do more work on the system, although for me personally I am more than happy trading with my approach, although I am not arrogant enough to believe it is the best in the world hence being willing to listen to peoples suggestions. I guess all I was trying to do was offer advice to a person who I thought was just starting out, to put them in the picture of what real trading is about i.e. you can't not take losses. Anyway thank you so much for your posts and contribution! Happy weekend everyone :-) Nexas

What a really interesting thread - and run by a fellow Brit - and a fellow Arsenal suuporter if I'm not mistaken. With such a combination how can it fail lol. Do you have (or see any merit in) a skype (or similar) room ? Range bars are great just with horizontal S&amp;R and trendlines and 1,2,3's. The only addition I like is the mini charts H1 H4 D1 so you can see the bias and the bigger picture. Mike

Hello spec, Regarding range bars, check out this site. Free download and full instructions how to put RB on MT4 correctly. NAH, I JUST CUT IT OUT. THANKS MEDICI! That website looks too flashy imo, but the indicator works well (for me at least ). You will just get loads of worthless e-mails after installing. Just spam them and you'll be all right... If you want to know more and / or get better RB indicators, browse (search panel on the top) FF as there is lots of such info. All your questions have already been answered long ago on this website. Regarding the setup - see the post no 1. (Only TLs and 3x emas)

Kris i get an Mailing List Not Active msg when i try to add my details can you post the indicator and manual please ?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thanks Kris and Monk. I appreciate the quick reply. I will check out the site and the indi. Wish me luck. thanks again

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Try one of the attached. They are EAs, so you need to put it in the 'experts' folder, then drop it onto an M1 chart, and finally open an 'Offline chart' (File menu).

--- 帖子 #373 ---
thanks Medici, it worked great for the 8 pip bars, but i can't get the 4 pip bars loaded without screwing up the 8 pip bars. i think i will just load up another mt4 image. thanks

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Of course. You will have to put the 4 pip chart on another offline chart. For example, if your 8 pip chart is on the M2, then use M7 for the 4 pip chart.

Hi Nexas, I tried to grasp 50 range bars, however I have encountered some technical problems with bar history (MT4), as it doesn't show enough bars for the analysis. It shouldn't take long for me to resolve this though, coz I am sure someone has had the same problem before, and more bar history never hurts . But to be honest I still prefer 8 range bars... tried other setups, but 8/4 seem to be the best fit for my MM. All the best, Kris

Really opened my eyes with your simple, methodical and logical approach to the markets. Very well done. I'm happy to say that I am now looking at the markets through a fresh set of eyes, which isn't easy to say for someone like me who's gone through hundreds of systems, made a lot of money and then lost even more. Thanks for that! -Darren

Hello Nexas, Trust you've had a good trading day yesterday. Just to paraphase your words above, do you mean that we should wait for a full 8 range setup (all EMAs in line), then take trades on 4 range? or... As you said in the 2nd paragraph, to trade 4 range and feel more confident when 8 range confirms? Many thanks, Kris

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Nexas, The jury's still out on whether or not waiting for the stochastic helps or not (As I mentioned in a earlier post). Looking like a bit of a wash or a slight benefit to ignoring the stochastic. Win rate's higher with the stochastic filter but total profit's a bit lower. Once I have a decent enough number of trades, I'll post the results. In the meanwhile, I've also been playing with using your 5 bar pullback trendline break for 123 reversals. This gives you a way to use the setup when the moving averages are flattening, not just trending strongly. Instead of waiting for a break of the 1 level in the 123, enter on the trendline break just as you do when the moving averages are trending. This gets you into reversals several pips sooner with only a slight drop in win rate (but more profits). I do require a MACD cross in the right direction in addition to the 123 pattern and 5 bar pullback trendline break. There was a good example of this on the 4 range bar at 8:42 EST. Waiting for the break of the 1 in the reversal pattern would have meant waiting until 8:46 and would get you in 5 pips later (which is a lot on a 4 range chart). Re the MACD. I don't know if you don't like indicators or just not used to using them, but remember, the 3 moving averages you use are lagging indicators just as MACD and stochastics are lagging indicators. All are based on price and time, it's just that the calculation of the moving average indicators is simpler.

I'm not trading the forex, but trade the 6e futures along with the emini's. Lately, the setups just aren't happening. The range on all the charts are horrible. You'd have to trade at great risk. Are you seeing the same in the forex.

I agree. I'm sure some will differ but the price action this past week was horrible in my humble opinion.

I didn't trade the last couple of days of this week for reasons already highlighted but it doesn't look all that pretty. There were opportunities but they were difficult to trade from the looks of it. Hopefully next week will make up for the last :-). In fact when we get a few bad days we should get excited... because it means the string of good days is fast approaching. It is after days like these that the pros make money and the new traders get frightened and start searching for new systems.

Actually, I thought it was a lovely week. I'm kind of a trading wuss and a big believer in taking what the market gives me and not trying to force anything. So, last week a lot of my trades were "fade the corners" trades I developed for non-trending markets. The interesting thing about this trade is that you want to trade it exactly at the times you don't want to trade Nexas' excellent trending setup, i.e., when the moving averages don't line up nicely and things are choppy (which on average happens more than half the time). Between the hours of 4:00 am EST (the absolute earliest I ever consider getting up to trade) and noon EST, Tuesday through Friday (I didn't trade Monday), it generated 10 signals on the EURUSD 8 range chart (2 breakeven and 8 winners). I got 7 of them but was away from the computer for 3. This was a bit better than the long-term average win rate of around 70%, (been trading it about a year). Reward to risk is usually around 1.5 to 2.5. You don't get a ton of signals but it performs best (and you get more setups) when trend trades aren't working. In a strongly trending market, you get very few setups and they don't work well, but, then again, you don't need them and shouldn't take them. For me it's a nice complement to trend trades. If anyone's interested, I'll post the setup. It's fairly simple and last week's results are easy to verify from the charts. It's also easy to manually backtest for longer periods.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
scjohn......I would love to hear about your setups. The averages just weren't flowing very well for Nexas's setups most of this week. Although I made money I had to scratch for it.....kadiddle

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi Scjohn, I have no issue with indicators at all, I just don't find I use them. I haven't ever really gotten on board with them. But if they help then of course I don't discourage them. I think if you use indicators to confirm what price is doing then they could probably be very useful. The problem is when people use them in isolation do you know what I mean? But I welcome your thoughts and suggestions, I am not nearly arrogant enough to think I know it all :-), I just know what works for me. Thanks for your input. Nexas

--- 帖子 #395 ---
You can do either. Your win rate will increase by waiting for 8 range EMA's to set up. It really is a personal choice, it depends on whether you are feeling aggressive or not. For me personally, I like to watch the price and the sentiment. For example, whilst the EZ was going into the toilet I would be much more likely to take a less than perfect setup to the short side rather than the long side. Does that make sense? Nexas

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Darren, Are you a pilot too? Thanks for your post, now all you need to do is build confidence with this system and stick to it. It won't be perfect all the time but as long as you are consistent, it will pay you. Nexas

Hi Fourx, No this thread isn't a commercial venture. Do I have outside ventures? Yes I do, but I have not brought that into this thread or forum. However due to the question being asked and in the interest of not breaking any rules I have sent a mail to the FF Admin with regards to how I should answer the question, unfortunately they have not replied yet. So if they come back to me and say due to my other interests I should be moved to the commercial forum then I apologize and will probably stop posting as much as it was meant to be fun. If the videos make you feel uneasy, again I am sorry and I don't have to post them here? If you are in any doubt about my intentions then, I invite the members who have PM'd me to to confirm that I have not solicited anything from them or even hinted at the fact. Nexas

hey Nexas - nobody is doubting you I'm sure. I would welcome your continued videos.

Congrats, Nexas!! One can see a veteran father and a dedicated trader with minimum "downtime". Well done on all counts! (Been there, done that )

--- 帖子 #403 ---
What is your (real) concern, FOURX (if you have any)? Has anyone ever FORCED you to pay for any trade-related knowledge? If you paid at your own will and were later dissatisfied, keep in mind what they say about poker - "If you don't know who the sucker at the table is, it's you"... Why come to a free party and complain? And what's wrong with a nice video intro? Nobody is making you read this (or any other) thread, here at FF or elsewhere. Even if Nexas has some hidden agenda, that doesn't make this current (free) thread bad. Were he turn commercial, it's not hard to use common sense to reach the "No, thank you!" decision. My apologies if I misunderstood the nature of your question.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
A lot of trend base setups had a hard time last week, not just Nexas' ones. Although I did manage some trend based profits, most of last week's joy came from the "fade the corners" trade I'll describe shortly.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I hope I didn't give you the impression I thought you arrogant. That certainly was not my intent. If I've learned anything in the 5 years I've been trading for a living it's that there's always much more that can be learned and I believe you feel the same way. So I hope we can continue to share observations openly and without any implication of anything other than the desire to help each other make more money.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi Scjohn, Oh sorry... No I was just joking. I was just trying to say exactly what you said. You can never learn too much. When I read books for example, even if it is complete rubbish, I have learnt what doesn't works, so I am always learning something :-). But yes you are completely right, we can always learn more, no matter how successful we are. Nexas

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's a description of the "fade the corners" trade setup I mentioned in an earlier post. It did quite well last week as it usually does in low ranging weeks or days. Although it can also do well in strongly trending markets (with the proper filters), because of the nature of the beast, very few signals emerge when the markets are moving. So, its role is as a complement to trending setups, not a replacement. It's primarily a support / resistance trade. I've experimented with many S/R trades to use in non-trending times, usually with middling to poor results. This trade has performed well for a year now. However, some weeks, when the market is moving strongly, there may only be a couple of signals all week. But then, the trend stuff is working so no sweat. But in last week's doldrums, it produced a lot of signals as it usually does when things get tight. The basic trade is quite simple. Set up a price channel indicator. This indicator simply measures the high and low price overy the last x bars (I use the default setting of 20 bars). It draws upper and lower lines similar to Bollinger Bands. The upper line is the highest price over the last 20 bars, the lower line, the lowest price. Stockcharts.com has a good description of this simple indicator on its Chart School. We're looking for times when the price channel is getting narrower indicating consolidation. If the last change in price channel has been compression (the upper and lower ranges are moving closer together) rather than expansion, we're looking for price to come very near (~2.5 pips or less) to either the upper or lower channel without breaking through it. Then, we're looking for a range bar that closes moving away from the channel (BTW, this trade only really works well with range bars). This sounds a lot more complicated than it is, so I'm attaching a picture of the morning of Jan 20 when 4 signals happened in a short period of time. If you look at the picture while reading the stuff below, it will hopefully be clearer. The white lines are the price channel lines (NinjaTrader calls them Donchian Channels). The other lines are the 100, 60, and 20 EMAs. Note that prior to 5:53 am EST, the price channels moved closer together. Then price touched the upper channel and was rejected. The entry would be immediately after the close of the red bar at point 1. The target is the lower channel. Note that, in the middle of the trade, the target got a bit closer as the channel compressed again between 6:17 and 6:20. Stop is a pip back of the price channel. We exit just after 6:17 when price hits the lower channel for a 29 pip gain on a 9 pip risk trade. As the last thing the price channels did was move closer together, we enter long at the close of the next green bar at 6:22 after price hits the lower channel and is rejected. Again, the target is the other price channel. However, this time we're stopped out by a signal in the other direction at 7:49 for a 13 pip gain. I would guess the signal at point 3 would also eventually qualify as a Nexas trend trade once the trend line broke (while points 1 and 2 would not). This trade hits the lower channel for a 20 pip gain. Note that point 4 is a valid "fade the corners" signal to go long. However, it gets filtered out for a couple of reasons: 1) We now have a strengthening downtrend. There is considerable angle and separation of the MA's but, more important for me, ADX on the 10 minute chart is above 20 and is ascending signalling a potential strong move. It's okay to fade early, weak, or weakening trends with this trade but not strong ones that are getting stronger. 2) It happens between 8:00 and 8:30 EST. I seldom trade the beginning half hour of the U.S. session as it tends to chop around a lot early. It's very important that the price channels have moved closer together prior to the signal. The latest move has to have been compression. Trading bounces off an expanding channel is pretty much just shooting craps. Personally, I filter counter-trend trades using ADX on the 10 minute chart as described above, but any indicator, including MA's, that show a strong (and getting stronger) trend can serve the purpose. The other thing I use the 10 minute ADX for is to indicate there's been too much of a good thing. I love with-the-trend signals but, once ADX gets above 50, trends tend to tire out and I'm wary of new signals with the trend (for this trade as well as trend trades). Note that the displacement option on the price channel indicator should be set to zero.

Thanks Nexas. A combination of 3 of your 4 pip range trades and one of my "fade the corners" trades (at 9:37 EST) gave me a great U.S. morning session today while the EURUSD was moving inside a tight 39 pip range all session. I passed on a winning 4 pip range bar Nexas trade at 10:48 EST as the downtrend looked like one of your "non-harmonics" and it had a poor reward risk ratio. But like you say, "What can you do?" The other 3 worked great. Time to take the dogs for a walk in the woods.

On this one, I'll go over the "fade the corners" trade. Will do the others later. Have an appointment this afternoon. Attached Image The signal came at 9:37 EST. I wasn't wild about it as the target was at only about a 1 to 1 reward / risk ratio. However, it was with the trend and note the bottom of the channel stairstepping up toward a flat upper channel. In my experience, this type of pattern tends to break to the upside and sometimes explosively (especially in such a strong uptrend) so I took the trade. In order to get a better potential RR ratio, I decided to only exit half of the trade at the upper channel and hope for a breakout. Another quarter would be exited at a 2 to 1 RR ratio, and the last quarter would be a discretionary runner. 9:44 hit the first target. 10:00 moved the stop on the remaining half to a pip below the swing low at 9:54. Now the entire trade was locked into a decent profit. 10:02 hit the second target at 2 RR ratio. 10:20 moved the stop on the remaining quarter to below the swing low at 10:19. 11:00 moved the stop based on the 4 pip range bar (I now had some 4 pip range contracts going) swing low at 10:59. 11:11 Last quarter stopped out at a nice profit. However, stop out was due to dumb mistake. I inadvertently set the stop at the swing low instead of 1 pip below. Stopped out by a half pip. Cost me almost 20 extra pips on the runner. But Nexas rode to my rescue at 11:12 as I took a Nexas 4 pip range trade that did well. Note: There was a "fade the corners" short signal at 7:45 that was filtered out because, as I said in my earlier post, I don't fade strong trends that are getting stronger.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Thanks scj, but I was more interested in looking at Nexas trades you took. I do understand your fade the corners method,keep us informed.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Getting older (reflexes aren't what they used to be) and, being basically lazy I only trade the EURUSD forex pair. It tends to move nicely with great liquidity and has very low trading costs. Trading only one pair is why I developed the fade the corners trade -- to have something to trade when things are spotty. I can make more than I need just trading EURUSD during the U.S. session from 8:30 am EST to about 11:30 am EST, so that's usually what I do. However, sometimes (especially if there's news), I'll trade London from about 4:00 am EST (or whenever I happen to wake up) until about 6:00. Then lunch doldrums tend to set in so I take a break until 8:30.

I did not start taking Nexas trades until after 9:50 EST yesterday as, although the MAs on the 8 pip and 4 pip lined up okay, upward momentum was obviously fading before then. I seldom take trades against Big Mo. Yesterday it cost me a couple of winners and saved me from a couple of losers, so overall it cost me a bit. This morning staying with Big Mo helped me quite a bit. Like the stochastic filter, it may end up not helping in the long run, but staying with Mo is in my comfort zone at least for now. Once Big Mo got on board, I started taking Nexas trades. If you click on the chart below, it will become big enough to read. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entries are marked with green triangles. I passed up a winner where the yellow triangle is. I already had a few runners going from prior trades so I passed up this trade which looked a bit marginal to me. In my previous post I said the price channel pattern was one that often broke for big gains. So I was swinging for the fences with a portion of my trades. I exited half at the swing high target, a quarter at double risk, and a quarter was a discretionary runner. The dollar signs are where I took partial profits. The little green up arrows are where I moved my stops on the runners to trail swing lows. The red diamond is where I screwed up and placed my stop at the swing low instead of 1 pip behind. Still stopped out at a profit, but it cost me quite a few pips profit on the runners. Never did get the explosive move up but still a very nice day. The three Nexas trades were ones I would not have gotten had I not stumbled upon this thread so, once again, thanks Nexas. Hope this helps.

Thanks Nexas. Although I do filter the trades a bit, your 4 pip range chart idea has actually accounted for most of my winning trades the past several days. I had always considered 4 pips inside the "noise level" and thus untradable. Goes to show you can always learn. Glad to hear things are going well albeit tiring with the new little one. Been there and know you can probably use some BTW, woke up a bit early this am and as soon as I looked at the computer a great looking 4 pipper setup was staring me in the face (at 5:44 am EST). Runner was good for over 20 pips. Nice way to start the day. Hope you can get back in the saddle soon.

This trade would have failed the stochastic filter I mentioned in an earlier post. I had previously decided to abandon that filter (it tooketh away more than it giveth). The momentum filter still looks a bit promising although it has more of an effect on win rate than actual profits.

A few of you PM'd me asking for some live trading examples, so this is the first of hopefully many. Please note that due to the recent market conditions I extended my 4 range to a 5 range. This is only a temporary measure and when the markets get some direction again I will revert to the 4 range. Also whilst rendering this first video I took another trade on the EURUSD but obviously didn't catch it on video but I am sure if you look at your charts you can see where it was :-) Anyhow I will post the video in the next post.

Hi all, Yesterday I had an opportunity to trade the whole day. I was using both methods (Nexas and Scjohn’s Donchian method) and must say, they do work very well... i f I could stick to them 100%!!!, but I wasn’t… Before discovering Rbars (not that long ago, only 1 month) I used to scalp a lot, and scalping does actually hide one big problem I thought I have never had a problem with. It turns out that there is still that “fear factor” within me that does not allow any profits run, thus I would close positions way too early (making a very bad R:R scenario), and when the losses would come (and they always do), they just take away all my profits, leaving a big minus at the end of the day. So… back to the lab J .

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Fear not, that comes with experience :-) The more time in front of the screen you have the better you will become. What is also useful is to look at all of the setups at the end of the day and note down how you would have done had you stuck to the rules. If you do this enough, after a short period of time you will find yourself doing more of the right thing and less of the wrong thing. Then you will start to see consistent profits. I hope that helps. Nexas

Hi guys, Do take a look at this: http://www.forextester.com/ The best $200 a trader can spend on self-education. 1-2 hour session with that programme allows you to "replay trade" a few days' (or weeks') worth of action. Think about it this way: if you cannot make consistent profit with ForexTester, why would real-life results be any different...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hi Nexas, Many thanks for your advice. I can see I am on the right track . Hi 007, If that simulator has Rbars, it could prove itself useful during late hours and weekends as I haven't encountered anything FOC with Rbars feature. edit: just noticed that ninjatrader (range bars) has FOC kinetic data feed (end of day), so will try this first.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Here's a suggestion to help mollify the fear and give you confidence to let a trade run. It's an early warning system that can tell you when a trade is likely (never guaranteed) to run a lot or if it's a good idea to take profits early. Almost all indicators, including moving averages are lagging indicators -- they follow price. However, there are a few that, when used in the right way, can be leading indicators -- they hint at where price is likely to go. This does not mean they are always right but the percentages are on your side. If you've read my earlier posts, you'll know that sometimes I like to swing for the fences and let my trades run a long time -- sometimes the entire position with no early profits. Other times I take profits early and often. This indicator is the prime determinant of how I make that decision. The indicator's not a proprietary thing. It's simply the Momentum indicator (almost all charting systems provide it free) but you have to use it the way the pros do, which is quite different from the way most new traders use it. On the morning of the 26th, it helped me turn two of my 4 pip range chart trades into very big winners (one 52 pips) with no fear (well, maybe a little ). It also can help with getting into trades. In his latest video, Nexas said he was concerned about getting into the EURUSD trade at 4:53 because the 8 pip range chart moving averages (lagging indicators) weren't lined up right. But the momentum indicator (leading indicator) on the 8 pip chart was practically screaming at him to take the trade. In fact, in my trading, lining up the 8 pip chart is an either / or situation. If either the MA's or momentum is on my side, I consider the 8 pip chart in agreement. Explaining this with examples will be a lengthy post but, if the group's up for it, I'll put it together. Otherwise, I'll PM it to Krisdetrader.

Range Bars have been requested (and promised) for ForexTester since... 2009. That feature is still not available (developers claims it's a very challenging task). So, to be correct, you cannot practice with Range Bars (yet) in ForexTester. As for Kinetick, it's great. Live feed is USD70 pcm and is very reliable.

Hi Nexas, Great video today. I was wondering if you take trades into the high/low of the day...now I know

Hi Scjohn, I am intrigued. I have tried momentum indi (14 bars) but it didn't show me much . Hi 007, I have set up kinetic (end of day); doesn't seem to work, needs some tinkering I suppose , but market replay works just fine. Have a great weekend everyone!

Explaining this with examples will be a lengthy post but, if the group's up for it, I'll put it together. Otherwise, I'll PM it to Krisdetrader.[/quote] Hi scjohn If you can spare the time, I would be very interested in how you manage to let profits run. This is something I'm struggling with right now myself. It's easy to just close the trade at the previous swing but sometimes the market offers so much more. I don't want to be greedy, but would like to learn how to take larger profits when they are available. Thanks. Also, congrats. to Nexas on the new addition to the family. And thanks so much for starting this thread and doing the videos. They are really improving my trading. I'm still on demo but if I keep doing well will take it live soon. Good trades to All. Mark

Several have asked for an explanation of how I use momentum to stay in trades and I'll post that shortly. However, I'd like to make it clear that most of whatever wisdom appears in the posts concerning this and how I trade does not come from me. After struggling with trading quite a bit, I was lucky enough to be able to afford to "sit at the feet of the masters" if you will and had two mentorships with 3 different top notch professional traders. One mentorship was with 2 of them and was a full week onsite at their offices. Another was a several-weeks-long online training course by another highly successful trader. Although they did share several specific setups, most of the work concerned the "theory" of trading and vital basic concepts. What I thought I would do is go over a couple days trading first that hopefully will show why I do what I do and then go over the momentum indicator and its use in detail. I'm doing this because I was lucky enough to stumble on this thread and pick up a couple of new ideas from Nexas (I'm always in the market for them) that have helped my trading. Hopefully, this is a way to give a little back. I'll compare some of my filters with Nexas' filters, not to criticize but to present an alternative in some cases. Nexas, you said you were open for ideas for improvement. If there are any new traders reading this, I'm certain that if you simply trade Nexas' setups and filters as is you will make money and outperform 95% of new traders out there (who will go on to blow up their account and quit trading). Nexas's setups and filters have the virtue of simplicity and effectiveness. I'm certain my techniques will improve results but at the cost of some simplicity. Life is nothing if not trade offs. The next post (apparently there's a length limit) will show how easy it is to stay in a big trade using a combination of MA's and Momentum. I'll use a trade from Jan 26 early am. Whenever I have a new toy (the 4 pip range chart), I tend to sometimes get up early and also trade the London session (although usually Tuesday through Thursday only). The second post will show why I like to use Momentum on the guide chart (the 8 pip) as a filter vs MAs. I'll use the U.S. session on Friday for this but, if you examine enough other trades, based on my experience I'm sure you see similar results. I've been using this particular filter for enough years to not feel the need for an extensive backtest but, if anyone would like to do one, I'll be happy to show them how to set it up.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
This was the morning of Jan 26. It was an almost perfect example. Most are a bit more ambiguous. Let's go over the trade first, then I'll explain how the momentum signals are determined. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In long at about 4:30 am EST. Momentum is neutral but both 4 pip and 8 pip MAs are in agreement (green 8). Hit 2x risk target at 4:32. Momentum is now weak (not strong yet) long so took half off at a profit. 4:35 -- reset stop to swing low at 4:34. If you're going to let trades run, you have to trail your stops in some manner. I like to use mini-swing lows and highs. If you break through them, you've lost one of your reasons to believe in your trade -- you're no longer painting higher highs and higher lows in a long and vice-versa for a short. Note that the reset was not made at the time of the 4:34 bar but simply used the swing low which, at that time, was not confirmed. 4:40 -- reset stop to 4:39 mini-swing low. Now momentum is a strong long signal. This was followed by several more stop resets, all the while both momentum and all six moving averages were moving up nicely. So, the question from about 4:39 onward was: Why would one even consider getting out of this trade until at least something broke? Price is painting higher highs and higher lows on the trigger chart (4 pip). Momentum is painting higher highs and higher lows on the guide chart (8 pip), and all the MAs are moving up with angle and separation. Getting out of this trade before something breaks is essentially giving up your edge. Could price have turned around on a dime and bit you? Of course it could have. The market can do whatever it wants whenever it wants. But what's the likely situation? Knowing what I know about momentum made me reasonably comfortable it would likely have sounded an early warning before too much of a price pullback. So the likely situation is for a continuation of gains. Consistently giving up "likelys" for "it coulds" costs a great deal of foregone profits. At around 4:57, there was a nice Nexas setup. I did not take it as I had already locked in significant profits on the move and still had a half-position runner. Also, it was the first pullback after a parabolic move on the guide chart which made it suspect. As it turned out it hit some nice profit targets. Finally around 5:08 momentum turned neutral, and I stopped out shortly thereafter, but the runner made a bit more than 51 pips. In this particular trade, the 8 pip MAs alone could have been used as a reason to stay long but, as you'll see in later examples, they can often steer you very wrong. Of course, momentum can also steer you wrong but not nearly as often. On the next post, I'll discuss how to set up and use the momentum indicator.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
This is a look at the 8 pip momentum indicator during the previous trade. (default setting of 14). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Prior to the trade momentum was down. It was below the zero line but, much more important, it was painting lower highs and lower lows. Once it hit the previous 4:15 high at 4:30 it moved to neutral, then moved to slight up as it broke through it. Then it broke through several previous highs so I considered it a strong up as it broke through the equivalent of heavy resistance on the momentum chart. Strictly speaking, you're looking for higher highs and higher lows to qualify for a strong up, but I'll often consider a pattern such as what happened at 4:47 as qualifying as a higher low. It's not really a low but you had a weakening of slope followed by a resumption of a steep slope. After that, momentum stayed strong until 5:09 when it finally painted a lower high. This is not a signal to exit, just a hint that price may be beginning to weaken. Note also that this is not the way many use momentum. The most simplistic way is: if MO is above the zero line, direction is up, or, if the slope of the line is up, direction is up. My method requires MO to break a previous high or low. And then you really like to see it paint new higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend just like price. As you'll see in the next post's examples, the value of momentum is that it almost always starts painting lower highs and lower lows in a long (vice versa for a short) before price does or the MAs change direction. And that price very often follows through on the trigger chart after MO changes on the guide chart despite what the MAs are saying. However, that post will be later (probaby tomorrow) as we're getting ready to go out now.

Obviously Rangebars devoid of time mean nice wavey charts could have taken a scalpers eternity to form. Attached rangebar time indi adds that element of time in the form of a traffic light system thus giving the trader an idea to the fluidity of the market at that particular moment in time.More suited to the lower rangebar traders : [Closing Time of the Bar] - [Opening Time of the Bar] &lt;= 1 min then prompt a yellow bar [Closing Time of the Bar] - [Opening Time of the Bar] &gt;1 min or &lt;=5mins then prompt a orange bar [Closing Time of the Bar] - [Opening Time of the Bar] &gt;5 min then prompt a red bar i.e. Yellow means Go - Red means No!!. hopefully of use to some. Adiós till next week. doc.

Hi Scjohn, I must say, very interesting stuff there! I have never used this indicator before but will certainly monitor it over the coming weeks, months to see if it can add some to my game. Already I average around the 1:2 risk:reward but if this helps me achieve the 4, 5 and even 10 times then you have a more or less bullet proof system, especially considering the type of strike rate this system already has... if you are not giving up you strike rate for this, then it is a very nice addition. Thank you for taking the time. Nexas

Here's the post I promised which goes over Friday morning's trades (The U.S. session -- I didn't get up early). There are some good examples of how to use momentum on the guide chart (8 pips) to filter trades on the 4 pip chart and to decide whether or not to let them run. There are several websites that describe the theory behind the momentum indicator -- a Google search will find them easily. I've received several private messages from new traders asking for more info, so I'll go over Friday in some depth (may take more than one post), then I promise to shut up for a while. If you're a new trader, remember my way of trading is more complex and you're well advised to stick with Nexas' easier-to-follow technique and make some money while you're deciding whether the added complexity is for you. I only trade one instrument at a time and need to get the most from it. It's difficult to trade a complex technique across several instruments. This is a method that works for me but it may not suit your personality, and trading a method that fits your own head is all important. We'll start at the 8:00 am EST to 8:30 time slot. In a previous post I said I don't usually trade until 8:30 and this is a good example why. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Two potential losing trades between 8:00 and 8:30 EST. I usually don't start trading till 8:30 and there was a major news announcement scheduled for 8:30. They were supported by the EMAs on the 8 pip guide chart, but not by momentum. The green 8 means the 8 pip EMAs were stacked in favor of a long (20 above 60 and 60 above 100). Red eight means stacked in favor of a short and yellow is indecisive (usually the 20 is in the middle of the 60 and 100) We got a trend line break at 8:31 with the direction of the 4 pip EMAs, but on the 8 pip chart, neither the EMAs nor Momentum were on board. At 8:33 another break and this time it was a Fade The Corners trade. A weak upward Mo was against it, but, as I said in an earlier trade, I'll often take a FTC against a weak trend. Upward Mo was weak as, although we broke the previous momentum high, there was no higher low yet and we had not penetrated several highs, only one. As the trade was against Mo, I took half off at 1x risk and, had Mo not turned when it hit the swing low target, would have taken the rest at that target (roughly 2 x risk). However, right before it hit the target, Mo turned to a weak down, so I only took a quarter off and kept a quarter trade runner which eventually stopped out at 8:37 at about the same price. At 8:41, we got a nice trend break down and Mo was now firmly in a strong down. However, the EMAs on the 8 pip chart were still stacked long. But I'll seldom pass up a strong Mo trade so I took the short. and as you can see from the chart above, it did rather well. Unlike the first trade, this one was with Mo, so my first target for half the trade was the swing low at roughly 2x risk. Then the rest was a runner with stop resets as shown. Finally, the half-trade runner stopped out at +25 pips (4.1x risk). Note that early in the trade, 8 pip EMAs were against the trade (EMAs lined up in the other direction) and they never got better than neutral (Not lined up in the direction but not lined up against it). The chart below shows the 8 range chart at the time of the trade. Mo is firmly on board (lower highs and lower lows), but the EMAs are still stacked up in the long position. They are converging though. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This brings us to 9:00 and is a good place to break. Will do the rest of the morning in another post. There are some other good examples.

Hi scjohn Appreciate it very much and looking forward to more.

Hi John, thank you very much for taking so much time to clarify your thoughts on momentum. Excellent and very interesting. I have "played around" with momentum on Renko/Range Bars for some time. What are your thoughts on zero line crosses? Enclosed is a 5 Range chart and Mom set at 7. Nexas, many thanks to you for starting this excellent thread. Happy trading to you all. Nick

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Onward through Friday morning trades. I promise once I get through these, I'll be quiet for a while and only speak when spoken to. Attached Image (click to enlarge) After getting out of my short at 9:00, there were a few trend breakthroughs down from 9:05 through 9:13 but nothing takable under either 8 range filter (EMAs or Momentum). Then there was a trendline breakthrough long at 9:17. At this time, EMAs on both the 4 pip and 8 pip charts were firmly against it, but 8 pip Big Mo was strongly up. As I've said before, I almost never pass up a strong momentum trade so I went long. Also, it was a 1,2,3 reversal pattern. It hit a first target at about 2x risk. Again, because Big Mo was flashing solid green, I kept a runner which stopped out at 9:27. This time the runner hurt. It stopped out at a profit but a lower one than the first target. Note that there was a FTC at 9:19 but it was against strong momentum so I passed. It made a little bit and I believe this was the first trade after 8:30 that had both EMAs lined up. Just after 9:30, there was another trendline break. Again both EMAs were solidly stacked against it but Big Mo still said go. And now we had a 123 reversal pattern on the 8 pip chart. I now had Big Mo on board, 2 reversal patterns, and Big Mo had just crossed the zero line up, so I only took off a third at the trend line target, another third at 9:36 (+29 pips) after two red bars, and the final third stopped out at 9:37 (+26 pips). To be continued.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Let's look at that last time period again, but this time on the 8 pip guide chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note that we first get a weak up signal on Momentum when it breaks the previous high and, as it moves to a strong up signal at 9:17 (by adding a higher low), the EMAs are stacked short. The EMAs finally get on board the long wagon 30 minutes and over 30 pips later. Will this earlier momentum filter produce some losers that the EMA filter would eliminate? Absolutely. Count on it. But my experience using Big Mo on other setups tells me it will make up for the extra losers several times over with winners, some of which will be big (like this one). Of course, the best way to believe that is to backtest on your own and practice trade it. In the next post, we'll finish out Friday's trading.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
The rest of the morning saw one more big trade (again in defiance of the EMAs on both charts, and the day's loser. Attached Image (click to enlarge) At 9:38 there was a trend line break up but it was the first one after a parabolic move up on the 8 pip chart (see previous posts) so I passed. Took the next one at 9:41 even though Big Mo up was weakening. I liked the upward move of the Price Channel. The pain was short lived as the market took all my position in about two minutes flat. Passed on the third up signal at 9:46. As one of my mentors used to say, "Fool me twice, shame on you. Fool me three times, shame on me." After two losing signals in any direction, I look for a channel breakout before I'll trade again. Also, Big Mo was in a strong down and the Risk Reward was not great. Finally, at 9:58 got a trend line break down. EMAs on both charts said long but Big Mo was a good down signal. As you can see, this trade did rather well. Runner stopped out at +25 pips. Glad it came when it did as I don't take new trades after 10:00 on Friday, but I will let an active trade play out after that. Of course all these posts are simply anecdotal evidence. What really counts is statistical proof which for most of you will require either backtesting or some time practice trading. Based on how Big Mo has performed for me in other setups I'm comfortable using it but it's important that, should you decide to use it, you build up some personal confidence first. Hope I haven't overstayed my welcome with such lengthy posts.

Which momentum indicator do you use and what are the settings. Thanks for your help and explanations they are truly helpful. Bobby

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Great info abt momentum indi and thank you very much for your kindness to share with us, scjohn. rrobichaux, It is the momentum indi that come with MT4, setting is default - 14. profitable trading to all.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Maxximuz is right. It's simply been called Momentum on every platform I've used, and I just use the default setting of 14.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Thanks Nick. I like to be on the correct side of the momentum zero line but it's not a necessity. I consider higher highs and higher lows a strong up signal even if the line is below zero. Being on the correct side of zero gives me a warm fuzzy but not much more than that. I do like it when my trade triggers in the same direction and near the same time as a zero line cross but I would never trade a zero line cross by itself in the absence of other evidence. I have no experience using a setting of 7. Does it work well for you?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Please note that my previous posts only suggested there may be a better way than 8 range EMAs to determine what the trends are. Nothing else about Nexas' approach would change (buying selling pullbacks in a trend with trendline breaks, using a combination of a short range bar chart with a longer one, etc.).

--- 帖子 #471 ---
hello nexas can i trade news with range bars? considering that it is a technical indicator.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hello all, Would you consider a chat room for this thread?. We could keep ourselves from bad entries and practice to perfection Nexas’s setups + Scjohns 8 range Mo confirmations and home runs.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Nexas' approach is similar to "Short Skirt" (Short refers to time period, not direction) by Linda Bradford Raschke - http://www.lbrgroup.com/index.asp?page=FAQ She also mentions some other tools and tricks which were referred to by several people here. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi John, I have enclosed a screenshot of the 4R chart using the 7 Mo cross above/below the 0 line in connection with the channel/MA's, and ofcourse as Nexas has mentioned, the confirmation of the 8R chart (trade/trend direction). Happy trading. Nick

Hi all, Trust all is well. Today is my last working day and from the following Monday I will start full time trading. The first week I will spend trying to take only the most obvious patterns to avoid unnecessary risk and overtrading. I will be posting them on this forum. Any (constructive J ) feedback is very welcome. I am not sure how many of you are trading this or any similar system, but it doesn’t need to be many to chat together and support each other through the day. Let’s see what you think.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Good luck. Always remember that with correct risk/money management and psychology (patience, discipline, and courage), there is an innumerable host of setups that will make a living for you. But without proper risk/money management, and if your head is not in the right place, there are NO setups that will make a living for you.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Thanks SC, I will keep that in mind.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Whatever size lot's your planning on starting with...cut them in half. TRUST me...you'll be happy you did. Try that for 2 months and if you're account is positive after trading everyday for 2 months then start trading with your original lot size you planned.

Ok mate. Working with smaller lots will definitely release some pressure (but not too loudly!) from me .

Best of British to you Kris, Just trading the two RB methods? or do you have alternatives should you happen to not be in harmony with RB's. regards doc.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi Doc, Thanks for your kind words. I do not have other strategy other than on this thread, and I still overtade! you know, someone on FF said - once a scalper - always a scalper . In my case - bad scalper. haha! I find myself using A+ setups from time based charts, and it doesn't work that way on Rbars... Patience, patience - said the man...

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Am I understanding this correctly? The three most important things in trading (in order of importance) are: 1) Risk / Money Management 2) Psychology (Confidence, Patience, Persistence, Courage) 3) Setups You say you overtrade. So you don't practice sound Risk / Money Management. You call yourself a bad scalper and say that is what you do. You only have a couple of setups, and these are setups that only work in very specific and somewhat rare market conditions. And you just quit your job to trade for a living.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
sc, Thanks for your feedback. I know what you mean. Apart from yours and nexas's setups I was trying some other things, that's all. Today has been quite a good morning for me. I know I need to practice more those things you mentioned, but we have to start at some point, don't we? I will try to post my trades at the end of the day. And yes, I will skip those not in line with this thread.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Don't get me wrong, I wish you all the best. My only point was that usually you want to have all three of these most important things solidly in place before you quit your job.

Here's my first trade of the day. 6e bounced off the pivot so it seemed a good profit target.

Here's my second trade of the day. Switched to the larger RB chart for entry because of the volatility.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hey Nexas, You need to get back in the saddle soon. Your stuff was smokin' today during the U.S. a.m. session. 11 winners and 5 losers with the winners making much more per trade than the losers lost. Had one 50 pip runner (which is a heap on the 4 pip chart I was trading and this runner alone almost singelehandedly made up for all the losers) and also had a 30+ pipper. The 5 pip chart would have had a couple less losers but also a couple less winners. So the win rate would have been better, but the $ less. So far I've not come up with a filter that improves $, although I can improve win rate (but at the cost of considerable $). Even momentum is not terribly useful to filter out your trades, although it can help in picking good trades against the EMAs.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I am wondering if anyone would be willing to offer me help. I called Interactive Brokers, they said their Trader Work Station software does not support Range Bars. Ultimately, I am looking for an incredibly reliable broker when I increase Lot sizes. Interactive Brokers is the only company I know of. Can anybody who is actually using Trader Work Station verify this? I really appreciate it if someone will take the time to help.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi John, Can you explain your "early warning system" and how to use the momentum indie?

You can use Ninjatrader as a front end to IB, thus keeping IB and getting range bars from the Ninjatrader platform.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
I second that - NT is an excellent platform, and it supports several good brokers.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I'll third that. I love NT. I use it to front end MB Trading who I like a lot as a broker but whose internal trading platform is beyond pathetic.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I use Interactive Brokers (TWS) but with NinjaTrader as a front-end for charting and placing orders. With Ninja you can have range bars , Renko bars, whatever you want.

Anybody else catch those two lucrative picture-perfect Fade the Corners trades during the U.S. a.m. session? Triggers were at 8:31 EST and 10:24 EST. There was also a scratch FTC at 4:37 EST and a nice winner at 4:50. These were on the 8 pip chart. I don't know how well FTC would do on the 4 pip chart but I suspect not as well. It's essentially pullback from strong support / resistance and 4 pips may not be significant enough. But I don't know because I've never examined it. Like I said when I posted the 8-pip-chart setup on January 22, it does particularly well in stagnant markets when Nexas and other trend trades aren't available. Since January 22, FTC has done extremely well. My last analysis of FTC was almost a year ago, so I think I'll post an analysis of the trades since January 22 (there were several). Since, from your standpoint, anything prior to that could be curve-fitted backtesting, I'll stick to the "out of sample" period after January 22. Will probably take a few days to finish it, but it's time for me to update FTC anyway.

Hi Jordi, I've made several posts showing how to use the momentum indicator. They were on Jan 28 and Jan 29.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
hello, when you say "as a front", do you mean just go to ninjatrader.com and download their software for free and use that for charting, but IB as broker? does NJ offer that for free?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
For real-time charting, it's not free. And you connect NT to IB and use NT for both charting and live trading. But IB would still be your broker, i.e. all trades entered using NT goes through to IB. All the info you need is available on the NT website: http://www.ninjatrader.com/Connectio...nnection-Guide

that is very helpful. thank you sir!

--- 帖子 #505 ---
nexas, when you have time, please explain a little more on your stop loss. also, entering at a minimum on the open of the 5th candle, of the preceding 4 candles, i have noticed not all are the same colour. do you just do it by "feel?" what you mentioned about a 50 pip range bar is very interesting. in your opinion, would that be accurate long term, less, or unknown?

Hi All, Sorry I haven't been around. This new born baby stuff is really taking its toll :-) I thought I was a seasoned pro with two daughters but my little boy is proving to be a different challenge altogether lol. I have seen I have missed some excellent trading days which is a little frustrating but hey ho... The problem I am having at the moment is that I am doing the schools runs which means I am not ablt ot trade for th first 90 mins of the UK session and the final 90 minutes of the US session. As I am sure you can appreciate, if you have an edge, inconsistency greatly diminshes this edge, or at least creates a new one which I do not have numbers on. So needless to say I have decided not to day trade until I completely focus. This should be the case when my wife can start driving again in a few weeks. In any case I guess that is no excuse for not posting here :-). So I will remedy that and just act as an agony uncle for anyone that wants one lol. I am however doing some swing trading, which is quite nice and relaxing. Anyway, I hope you are all ok and I will try to answer any questions as they come. Nexas

My stop loss is the easiest part of my trading :-) It requires no thought, just place it behind the last swing by 1-2 pips. The 4th candle rule is generally 4 candles against the trend in succession, although feel sometimes does come into it, when trying to judge the momentum etc. With regards to the 50 I think it would be accurate for longer term trading, it is about the equivalent of the 4 hour. I like it for my longer term swing trading :-)

--- 帖子 #509 ---
hi nexas, oh, ic. i think i understand. for example, during a retrace in a downtrend, we would get a couple of candles going up. a trendline would be drawn underneath those couple of candles going up. when price goes through the trendline (heading down), we enter. with the SL 2 pips or so above the HIGHEST point of those couple of candles that were heading up in the latest retrace (in the example of a downtrend that is). it is for this reason, the typical stop loss would be small, say 4-8 pips total. please correct if wrong. the only reason i mentioned 50 bar range is because you mentioned it before, and i really cannot stay glued to the screen as I have a full time job. if you don't mind, would you like to share your typical time management working with 50 bar range? Like do you look at the screen for 5 - 10 minutes once every 4-&gt;8 hours? that would be my assumption. although extremely redundant at this point, but would still like to say thank you for all the help you've given on your thread.

How do I load range bars to charts,I attatch them,but they stay as candles?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Fourx, Range bars are candles :-) Sorry I refer to them as being bars but it doesn't matter. All that matters is that each and every is the range from high to low that you define. Hope that makes sense. Nexas

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi, Exactly, although I use 1 pip more often than not. With regards to the 50... I always have it in the background, I am I make hotlists of the ones that look like they are setting up (you can do this in Ninja Trader). I check perhaps more often during the EU and US session and then once or twice in the evening... but then I am an addict :-) You are welcome, I am glad you are finding it all useful Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #513 ---
hey Nexas They stay as time based candles, ie.(various lengths)

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi Fourx, mmmm that is strange. Unfortunately as I do not use MT4 it is difficult for me to comment. Can anyone here help fourx? Maybe you have to do that thing with opening offline charts? Nexas

--- 帖子 #515 ---
This question has been answered before on this thread, and the relevant EAs posted. Could FOURX possibly check back a few pages for the relevant information?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
medici I have checked,and cannot find anything that helps me.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi FOURX, check your pm. Nick

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Fourx, are u using EA or script? anyway, regardless of script or EA, load it up on M1 chart then set the range that u want in pip and TF. goto File then open offline chart. For example; if u set 8pips range with TF 2min for EU then u will see under the offline chart there is a EURUSD, M2. Click to open the offline chart, u will get 8pips range bar chart. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #519 ---
hey max done all that, but no M2 chart showing in the offline charts?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Fourx, pls check your PM.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi Everyone, I thought I would write a quick post on the above topic as after a few PM's with people I realized that the above concept is not completely clear. As good technical traders we are to take every valid setup we see right? The correct answer is Yes :-) So then what does the above mean? Well even though a setup maybe valid, certain setups are more valid than others. This is where experience helps a great deal but... Lets say we are in a down trend and we are selling the relief rallies. A valid setup would be a pull back... but there are various kinds of pull backs... Basically the cleaner the price action the better the setup. So if I am in a trend that is labouring... it is breaking to new lows but it always seems like a laboured move and whats worse the pull backs are ugly too, so you don't have clean full bodied candles, instead you have spikey price action. Well in this instance even though a setup may present itself I may opt to take a smaller position size. Whereas if we had strong momentum moves followed by clean pull backs... well then I would be in heaven... that is the price action I love to see because it usually leads to excellent risk reward trades and these are the ones I load up on. Now I am not saying to load up and kill yourself, I am just saying that with the not so great setups take maybe only half of your normal position size. Save your full position sizes for those trades that make you warm and fuzzy inside :-) Now ultimately this does come with experience, but I promise you the more trades you take (sim, backtesting or live) the better you get the GREAT setups start to jump out of the screen at you. I hope that helps some of you guys out there and welcome some of the more experienced guys confirm this :-) Ultimately as long as you are consistent in what ever it is you choose to do, your bottom line should improve. Nexas

Hi, How are you all? Just to let you know that I am slowly but surely getting back into the swing of things. So will be able to post all of the trades that I am taking again. Managed to do a bit of trading today and bagged some nice profits, how did you all do? Nexas

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Nexas, Do you have any suggestions for someone like me who can only trade 30-45 minutes a day during early USA session? Previously, I traded a trendline break system on 1H, 4H (anti-trend) which gave very few trades but overall profit. but I prefer to trade your system now. A year before that, when I was briefly unemployed, I traded THV as well as a guppy system, which I got slaughtered in. In my opinion, your Range Bar trading strategy is excellent (although I don't have time to trade a range of 4or5 or 8 chart due to a full time job) Very appreciative of your thread. and most appreciative about you talking about how to take and accept losses, as well as accepting the act of cutting profits short (because you just never know), which is a reality of trading. in fact, it is for that reason why you come across as a credible profitable trader. out of curiosity, do you occasionally increase your lot size when you are having a winning session?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Chiba_San, Thank you for your message. With regards to trading only with 30-45 mins per day, I would say look at the longer term charts like maybe a 50. Ultimately there is little that you can do if you cannot be in front of the screen with regards to day trading. You will have to accept you will be taking longer term swing type trades. I don't increase really on a winning streak, but I do use different sizes depending on the trade setup. So if the setup is one of the better ones I will take a full position out whereas if it is a slightly worse setup I may only go in with half of my normal size. Does that clear it up for you? Nexas

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi Nex and all traders, I have read this tread and have seen the pips you all have made, please forgive my ignorance but I require all of your expert advise.please can anyone explain to me how this system works. Awaiting your favourable reply.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Wicked Forex, I am not sure what you mean? Have you read the first few posts? It is ultimately a swing trading system. We are looking to enter in the direction of the trend when we see a pull back. I hope that helps. Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Nex thanks for the reply, I am humbled by your presence. I am new at trading and had a read through the series of posts. Please forgive my ignorance, what I understand is the moving average must be in line and you trade after the 4th complete bar moving in the same direction of the moving averages and then set stop loss from previous bars low if it's A sell. Please can you explain further to fully understand your genuis system? Many thanks a frustrated wicked forex

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi Wicked, If you read the first few pages I think it will be clear. Also if you watch my videos. I don't really want to write it all out again as I will literally just be repeating myself. If you have any specific questions I will be happy to answer them, but as far as the general system goes that can definitely be learnt from the first few pages. Is that ok? Nexas

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Nexas and all, Finally a worthwhile range bar thread! I have my own strategy, which is similar but perhaps slightly more selective, although I look at up to 8 pairs. I plot 2 EMAs: the 200 and 21. 8 pip range bars. I am looking for longs when the 200 is pointing up and vice versa. The only exception is when the 200 is flattening and price may touch the 200 and it is converging with the 21. Basically I only trade when price is at or near the 21EMA, and I need at least 2 positive candles to enter - 2 pin bars is the ideal. Logical stop placement behind price action, targeting 10-15 pips, again TP at logical points. I have attached a pic (I hope - first time!) Btw I'm not saying I traded all these, just that they would be valid set-ups for me. Cheers, Mark

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi All, Just a quick one to let you know I have started the following thread where we can all post our actual trades. They don't have to be live as sometimes, there just isn't the time, but they do have to be real (demo or live), not hindsight trading. This thread will remain dedicated for those trying to learn the system so we don't clog it up too much and then when you are ready to start to put the theory into practice you can jump on over to the other thread for actual trading. Does that sound like a plan? Nexas

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Sounds good but where's the new thread, on here or skype ?

Hi SCJohn, is it possible to post pictures of this post? I know it was a while ago, was just curious. Also do you always fade the corners or only in a ranging market. Look forward to your reply. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
The four signals are marked with blue dots with the first one at 4:37. Note that it was essentially stopped out at about scratch by a FTC in the other direction at 4:50. The second one did rather nicely. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The ones at 8:31 and 10:24 also did well. When markets are not ranging (moving with some strength in one direction), I will usually only take FTC signals in the direction of the trend. However, they tend to be few and far between. In ranging markets, I'll take trades in either direction. The primary value of this trade is to have a viable trade in non-trending markets. In a ranging market, I'll usually target about 1x risk for the first half, the other bar for a quarter, and then see what the market is doing re momentum and a breakout of the channel to decide on the runner's fate. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hi Nexas, and other contributors. Thank you for this Elegant method. Have digested most of the thread. I find it awesome. It took me a while but finally got the charts dialed in. If I could share a youtube 9m video for proper installation of the "RangeBarChart v103a" for MT4 here: http: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=slyVGh7TXGo , it is xlnt and it even shows how to easily set up multiple pip bar charts using one 1m chart. OK, I have reviewed todays PA and just wanted to verify that I kinda sorta got an idea about what's going on here. These are both 4rg's. The 1st chart is later today, NY mid morning and the 2nd chart is from Near Frankfurt open. The last 2 entries on chart 1 are a bit of a question to me. I believe all 3 on the second chart are valid. Also does consensus have us waiting until 'trend line break' candle is closed before entering? Thanks Darryl

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I would like to contribute by saying typically, when the ema's flip in the right direction, the first pull back is ALWAYS the best one. the second one, you should also trade it. the third and subsequent ones become weaker. obviously, one can contest this and say that during a strong trend, you could have 10 pull backs all of which become winners. but I am just contributing my 2 cents. if you want to put down your big money, do it on the first 2 pull backs of an ema flip.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++ I have noticed that. Guess I'm not the only one. Thanks

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi Chiba_San, what MA's do you use and what number range bars? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
what a question,have you read ANY of the thread

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Have read the thread but some people switch it up to their own preferences, including certain ma's. just saying.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi Nexas. A question on stops. I understand the 2 pip under last swing as the norm. My question is, is there a Minimum SL to be respected? Same question regarding whether 4 or 8 range. Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Diamonddbw, I think you have a pretty good grasp of the system. Both of the two that you are querying make sense. Granted they aren't as clean but you do have the MA's lined up and the retracements aren't too deep. I think you know what you are doing :-) Nexas

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi Darryl, For me I don't have a minimum, by definition, the bars themselves will ensure there is a minimum. I place 1-2 pips behind the swing as you say. What we are looking for here is turning points in the market, back with the trend, if we are wrong we want to be out pretty quickly. Does that make sense? Nexas

--- 帖子 #544 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Yes, it makes perfect sense. Thanks again for sharing your discoveries.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi Nexas. Quick question regarding entries; On this entry, I did not wait for red 8rg to close. I believe I read something similar in an earlier post of yours. I entered once the bar had cleared the trend line, just barely. My thoughts being that this was the only significant retrace in hours and that price would surely come crashing down afterwords. As you can see, it didn't. Which brings me to this point; I lost this trade to the tune of 7 pips. Are you kidding me? That's hardly a ripple. Thanks again for sharing. Darryl

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks Nexas for the great simple system. I've been using range bars for a year or so and wouldnt trade with any other chart. Does anyone know of a MT4 range bar indicator that has an Email alert in it? I trade larger range bars in my main system but would like to have an email alert when a new candle appears. I'll share my range bar system if anyone is interested. Thanks to all.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
why not bro you should share your system with us so may we learn another good system and makes more improvement

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hi Outlaw, Thank you for your post and welcome to the thread. Yes of course please feel free to post your system. Nexas

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Here's what I use. It's compatible with range bars. Hope it helps. And by the way, congratulation Nexas on an excellent approach, as well as a big thank you to others for sharing your insights and techniques on range bars.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Attached is an indicator I threw together that plots four horizontal lines on the chart, two above and two below current price. They mark the location where a new bar will open (and where the bar after that will open assuming it continues in the same direction). They slide up and down as the size of the current bar changes. I use it so that I can better anticipate the opening of the new bar as well as to see where that open will be in relation to other indicators on the chart. Attached Image The code looks to see what size your range bars are by examining the previous bar, so if you change the range bar size you'll need to remove the indicator and re-add it. George

--- 帖子 #551 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Pretty cool WF. Nice work. Anything else that you have just "Thrown Together"?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Put a simple 3 bar MA (set to close and shift it 3) on your chart. If the bar crosses the MA and closes the correct color take the trade. Scalping at it's most simple. SL behind the signal bar. TP up to you. (semafor just to keep an eye on hi's and lo's) If MA goes flat = sideways no trend no trade. Stop when your profit target for the day is reached and go play.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Great and interesting system here. I will be following along and demoing this method. Just trying to find a good range bar indicator for MT4 charts. Nexas, just a word to you.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Neither. I use a 5pip range chart. Works best for A/U. Size of range bar easy to work out. I used to trade 5 min charts. So I put ATR indi on 5 min chart set to 100. Came up with 5. Hey Presto! Works like a charm.

Greeting Nex &amp; BataVier, nyc system Batavier please can you explain more on which orther indicators you use to trade with your system? I have attached to the cart and it comes up with the top and bottom lines. I have attached to range bar setting 5. Is this correct. How do I trade the system?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
My System is different to Nexas. Thanks Nexas for allowing us to put other methods in your thread. Put a simple 3 bar MA (set to close and shift it 3) on your chart. If the bar crosses the MA and closes the correct color take the trade. Scalping at it's most simple. SL behind the signal bar. TP up to you. If MA goes flat = sideways no trend no trade. Stop when your profit target for the day is reached and go play. Take a look at my picture. Here's how I traded the Asian market today. Range bars set to 5. Just use standard MT4 moving average 3 set to close and shift by 3. Note line A. Market making higher lows = uptrend. See number 1. Green bar closed above 3X3MA. Buy at red line. SL at magenta X. Take profit when bar closes other side of 3X3Ma yellow line. 13pips See number 2. Market still making higher lows = uptrend. Green bar closes above 3X3MA. Buy at red line. Sl at magenta X. Exit market at next yellow line. Break even trade. Note Line B. Now a lower High = downtrend. See number 3. Sell trade at red line (took me a moment to do was still closing previous trade, you do need to pay close attention to the market!) SL at magenta X. Exit at yellow line as green bar closed above 3X3MA. 4 pips You need no other indicators. Let your eyes tell you what's going on. If you can't see hi's lo's put a fractal indi (standard MT4 indi) on your chart, or a semafor(search FF it's here.) I trade A/U because it suits my lifestyle I'm awake during Asian hours. Also it is active in all markets.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Not sure I follow the logic here. At point 3 you used the last two highs to determine market direction. At point 1, you ignored many other highs and lows. In fact, at point 1, the market had just made a lower high and a lower low. Given your logic at point 3, how is point 1 an uptrend? What's the rationale for ignoring certain highs and lows and switching focus from long term trends to short term trends and back? Since point 2 involved a higher low, from not only point 1 but all other lows on the chart, why isn't that now an uptrend? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Not sure either is to which higher lows you are speaking. I think you're talking about the 3m.a. having higher lows for a long entry. The only problem with this is since you have the 3 sma shifted right by 3, it will take 3 bars beyond your entry to confirm you actually are going to have a higher low on the average. If you're talking about higher lows on the bars then I really don't understand your long entry at 1 either.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Okay, I spent all day yesterday looking at this and decided to go forward with live forward test. Todays results were 6/7 positive trades. Total pips gained were 53 pips. Nexas, again thank you for being so helpful.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Xlnt GG99. Today was an almost perfect storm for this trade. I am never up during the London session but I was every day this week except today. I was just too tired to stay up. This is what Nexas means by taking full advantage of days like this. Feel free to forward some of those pips this way...

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I see your problems. I've been watching charts for a long time now. Instinct is now part of my trading. Helps me decide when to focus on long term trend or short term fluctuations. I'm basically a scalper by nature. Entry at 1 was market open for me. Saw overall trend was up. Expected this to continue. Why? If you shrink your chart and look left there was for me an obvious resistance zone that had not been broken effectively downward hence expected a rally, break up of 3X3MA confirmed this for me. 2nd trade also bounced of a resistance zone . 3rd trade lower hi (hi's lo's of price not 3MA) demonstrated weakness and possible trend change. ( zone for me can be 5 to 10 pips wide, ie up to 2 bars deep. not an exact science) Support and resistance is easier to see if you make your screen into a line chart, you'll see the bounces. See attached piccy I've drawn a white line at the zone I noticed for trade 1. I often flick back and forth between bars and line chart to get a different perspective. There is method in my trading madness. Just information that I assume and don't even consciously think about, almost like driving after many years. You just do it. Another analogy, trading is like some paintings in the gallery, stand back squint a little and it all makes perfect sense. Blessings to all. Monday brings a whole new week of opportunity your way, keep at it practice makes perfect..

Hello Wf, I trade with range bar chart,Your indi seems very interesting and importent as we know charecterstics of range bar.I used your Indi,i think is not working properly on my chart,please check and please tell me what would be wrong on my chart.My R bar size is 10.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
What symbol are you using? I'm not sure how it could be wrong since it is taking the actual size of the previous bar and using it to calculate the distance of the lines. Did you drop the indicator on the chart after setting the bars? Attached is a version that will print the current range bar size to the Experts log so that you can see if the value makes sense. George

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Symbol is EUROUSD,yes I droped the indi after setting the bar.Is there any other procedure,please tell

--- 帖子 #577 ---
What value printed in your experts log? I've attached another version that allows you to manually set the range bar size. You have to set it in pips/points, not as the integer pip value. For example, 10 pips on a 5 digit broker would be 0.001. If you leave it at 0.0, it will calculate the pip value as before. George

Yes,now properly working, Exlant ,Thank you George.

So here is my results from Tuesdays trading. I was 3/8 for -9 pips. I have attached pictures of both the 5 bar and 8 bar charts with arrows of trades taken. In addition to Nexas trades I also take 123 trades either direction. Nexas, I hope you don't stay away to long.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Wicked forex, I am a full time trader so I start trading at midnight pacific standard time. I look for nexas trades that are with the trend and also the 123 trades. 123 trade is a low/high, followed by a high/low, followed by a higher low/lower high in consecutive candles. See previous chart for what they look like. Am trading right now so, on next posting will try and explain trades/why taken.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Golfer Sir, many thanks for 123 explaination, so if i understand correcttly you are usinge nexas trend i.e. the 20; 60; 100 slopping down you look to sell and vice versa?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Wicked, Well for the 123 I will take those signals counter trend.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Here's an update where only the first level up and down is shown. George

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Okay, So today's results, took 9 trades with 5 positive. Ended the day with 9.2 pips positive. Will be trying something tonight. I noticed that on the 5 bar you could stay in trades longer if you took trades when they crossed the 20 EMA. Then stay in trade until it closes on the opposite side. Stop would be 1 pip below the high or low of signal bar. See attached chart for example. The example happened last night right at the end of my trading day.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
It would appear to me the long you took, by any measurement, was in a downtrend. I can't see any valid reason for entering the long you've illustrated. Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Thank you George for updation,One who knew the characteristics of range bar can do lot with this indi,this is the only indi can tell where the next bar will open perfectly and guaranteed!!!

--- 帖子 #588 ---
hi nexas, using 8 range on eur/usd, I've done well the last 2 days. I have not been able to hold on for a 1:2 risk to reward ratio. I just SL or TP at the last swing hi/low, so it's usually a 1:1 risk to reward ratio. Typically, when the ema's flip, and when the PA retraces nicely according to the 8Range bars for 4-&gt;5 bars, once price breaks the imaginery trendline, I take the trade on start of the next bar. I go in with pretty big 300-500K and always exit at the last swing hi/lo. when it's not an ema flip, and there's been multiple retraces, I usually go in with 1 or 1.5 lots. or even half a lot. Can you critique my views on the ema flip? this is what I learned around a year ago from watching price action. but with your introduction to range bars, there's so much more confidence now...

--- 帖子 #589 ---
kadiddle, You are right. That is what I was saying was that noticed if you just took the trade either up or down regardless of the MA's and hold until you either got stopped out or closed the other direction on the 20 ema. Just a thought that I am testing out. So far so good. Just took a long on EU @ 12:55 am pst that is currently up about 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
but that still doesn't make sense, since according to your chart, you would have been stopped out even before price ascended...

--- 帖子 #591 ---
chiba_san, did you look at the chart? It said right on it that price came to with in .00007 pips of being stopped out.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
oh, alright, missed that, sorry

--- 帖子 #593 ---
wow, the last two hours, on the eur/usd 8 range has been tough. i mean that complete move up, every single attempt to take a retrace would have been stopped out, only to shoot up right after... guess gotta take the good with the bad when we use tight stop losses

very well. Here you can see my current my open positions on eurusd. I'm holding 9 shorts . I've taken profits in every trade. All open positions are runners.

hi nexas, I couldn't do it using a 4 or 8 Range, I would keep getting stopped out, onlly for the trend to continue. this happens quite a bit. i changed it to a 15 range and a took the first or second retrace after a re-allignment of the ema's and just put in a 30 pip tp or sl. that's working so far. I just use that ATM thing through ninja trader and then I don't even need to watch the trade anymore.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
took 3 trades today. all of which were between 1.5:1 and a 2:1 trade just now on the 8 range on the eur/usd. all 3 won. nexas, out of every 10 trades, what would you say is your experience in win trades versus loss? do you typically win 5/10 trades? or 6/10 or do you not keep track of that part?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Chiba, what size stop would you be using on the 8 range please?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hi, Glad I stumbled across your thread a few weeks back. Been trading your setup (albeit somewhat filtered as I've indicated in prior posts) with considerable success on the 4 and 8 pip range charts. An even bigger impact on my profits has been switching my thrust trades (my big money makers) from the 7 pip chart with a 10 minute guide to a 4 pip chart with an 8 pip guide. Lots of additional pips there. I'd like to share the final version of my filters with the group but have a question. I want to be sure I've identified all the triggers as correctly as possible. In the following chart, assuming all the EMA's are lined up, which of the four trend line breaks (blue dots) would you consider to be takable signals? Based on my interpretation of the rules you initially posted and the video examples, and assuming the relevant swing low is the first one in the attached chart, it appears to me all are valid signals. I know the second and third breaks only have 3 bar pullbacks but I've seen you treat that kind as continuations of the first pullback. For the ones that are not, why not? What are the rules/guidelines that would eliminate them? Attached Image Incidentally, all would have been eliminated out by my filters (even though the EMA's were indeed all on board).

--- 帖子 #602 ---
my stops were per the rules. for interactive brokers, it's half a pip as a tick. so the mistake i was making before using 4 and 8 range bars was that they were actually 2 and 4 range pip bars. i now changed it to 16 range bars (8pips) and it's working pretty good. not a lot of trades though. i think 8 pip range is pretty good. sometimes you can get in late and it will still work. i would like to ask, how are people dealing with no historical information from IB? i was told in addition to the 55usd for ninjatrader, I have to fork out another 50usd for kinetick for historical information. it's annoying right now. sometimes i have to wait up to 2 hours to get an idea of the ema's before I can trade

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi Chiba_San, Typically if you are waiting for the best setups you should get 6/10 or better... But from day to day, week to week this can change and swing in either direction. But overtime you should be ablle to get a 60-70% strike quite realistically. Thanks Nexas

--- 帖子 #604 ---
hi all, just took 2 shorts on the eur/usd on the 8 pip range bar chart. first time got stopped out for a -9 pip loss. then I shorted again when it re-broke the trendline and made +17 pips. now waiting to get back in. nexas- with 6/10 and with a 1.5-&gt;2.0/1 risk to reward ratio, I think we should all do well. in fact, very well. I am now also using the price alert. an alarm goes off when the price strikes through a price I enter in ninja trader. that helps since I don't have to stare at the screen which gets super boring after a while. i think this is very prosperous. i am happy about this. I've read more on range bars. it does take out the noise well. however, the price alert is super important especially when it's on a higher range bar range (less trades) nexas- are you paying for historical data to an additional provider on top of the fee for using ninja trader? btw, just a recap, I think I am somewhere in the range of 12 wins to 4 losses since I started trading again (and using this) which I believe was early last week. There were all types of issues mainly with me not understanding the platform (ninjatrader) but i think i'm good to go now. (note, taking the average risk to reward amongst all trades, it should be somewhere in the range of 1.4:1. which means technically, if you had a 50/50 win to loss record, you would still do well as long as your Lots are big enough)

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Scjohn, So let me understand... the chart you have shown have the EMA's lining up for shorts? Well if that is the case, the first would be valid... you would have been in the second one but a bit later... I would have adjusted the initial trend line and not drawn a new one. Then due to already being entered into the second one the thrid one would have been skipped and then the 4th one as well as I probably would have drawn a trend line connecting most of the lows so we wouldn't have had an entry. But please if you are having success feel free to post the system you are now using after having played with the various filters. It can only benefit the rest of our little community :-) Speak to you soon. Nexas

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi Chiba_San, That is excellent news! I am happy to hear you are doing well! Just a quick question... how did you short the Euro? I have a bias to short but the EMA's are not aligned yet on either chart? Thanks' Nexas

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi Nexas, Here you go, brother! Just one point to note, that entry you see in the center, was a mistake, I quickly sold it for like a couple pips profit in this scenario, but it was purely a mistake. The first time I got in was the only time you would have been able to do it around 2 bars after the mistake... and I got stopped out for -8 (with commision and spread = -9). the second one hit TP pretty fast. you mean your ema's look different? I am using 20, 60 and 100. a 16 range chart on Ninjatrader = an 8 pip chart.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
I pay for the Kinetick service. Start Ninja, connect to kinetick then to IB, then disconnect from Kinetick. That way you don't need to hang around for 2 hours waiting for your Emas

--- 帖子 #609 ---
cinchona, so that's 55usd + another 50 usd you are paying? btw, per my chart, my ema's on the 8 range were all aligned and going down. was it like that on your's too? ...cuz nexas is saying his ema's weren't aligned.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi everybody, if it can helps, for me the EMAs were not aligned for the short one (in this moment they were aligned contrary, for the long trade, same on the 4bars chart)

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hi Tomlee, Thanks for the update... I can confirm that they were not aligned for me either. Strange... Nexas

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi Nexas, I am happy you are back here. It seems, it bounce on Daily PP for the moment.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I actually pay a bit more for Kinetick as I subscribe to futures as well, including Eurex data. Regarding EMA alignment can you be precise about the time and timezone you're referring too.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
are your ema bars back 256 or infinite? mine are on 256. it could also be cuz I don't have historical data, and it's using whatever I have to calculate. alternatively, I just eyeball the 5M chart on IB just to see if it's been going up or down. but inconsistent EMA's will definately be a worry in the long run...

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Yeah, that little unholy mess was from 08:25 EST to 09:02 EST. The concept of keeping the original swing low as the anchor for all was one that I missed. Makes sense. I usually keep a highly detailed trading journal that logs all signals for EURUSD from 04:00 EST to 07:00 EST and then from 08:00 EST to 11:00 EST, whether or not they are takable and whether or not I'm actually trading (trades derived from charts are tagged as hypothetical). This has been incredibly useful for finding patterns. Unfortunately, due to some unexpected travel I'm a bit behind in logging stuff but hope to catch up by the weekend and will then double check my data and release the final filter findings. In the meanwhile, if you're trading the 4 or 5 pip with an 8 pip guide and the 20 EMA on the 8 pip is sloping in the opposite direction of the trade be very careful. Have found very few of those that worked.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
nexas, look at the eur/usd drop! it's annoying when it falls like that and you can't get back in since it doesn't want to retrace...

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hi Nexas, This is from a much earlier post. Is this still your method? Do you give deeper retracements more latitude and allow an opposite candle color? How deep is deep and how shallow is shallow? i.e., less than 1.5x risk is shallow or something like that? Just trying to have my journal model for filters reflect your current thinking. I can actually adapt it to almost any exit strategy for playing "what ifs."

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Actually Chiba_san, there were several ways to take bites of this apple. I went short on a thrust trade at 8:01 EST (white arrow) and stopped out with a nice profit at 8:38. Just yesterday I mentioned that it's my big money winner and have discussed it in other posts. If anyone's interested, I'll review it when I go over the Nexas filters in a few days. I believe it's vital to have more than one type of arrow in my quiver. Nexas' setup is a pullback in a trend and one of the most important types of setups. But sometimes trends don't offer pullbacks which is why a thrust type trade (not a pullback but an initial move) is important. But they require heavy filtering (I only take about a third of the signals). However, it seems to me there were two Nexas setups at around 8:39 and 8:48). The second one even had a 5 wave on momentum. However, I would not have taken the first one and was already short on another thrust trade that triggered at 8:42. That one just stopped out at a nice profit at 9:14. Been a great morning and I'm betting on consolidation now so I'm going to walk the dogs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #620 ---
That's what I am calling the great morning too Bravo scjohn

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Graphic evidence why it's better to just read the charts and not try to predict the future (see my earlier post). Oh well. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Just curious, did anyone short the eur/usd @ 1.3090 with an approximate 40 pip target tp and 35 pip target SL? I did hours back and am still in it. this was according to the 8 pip range although I'm sure even higher pip range bar charts would show the same trade...

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I got in this EURUSD 24 pip RB trade this morning. Up 50 pips, planning to exit 5 pips short of support. If this were live, would have exited long ago. I entered shortly after the break of the trendline instead of waiting for candle close.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
haha.... well, i must say that a 24 pip range bar does clear up the noise big time in this scenario... you would been able to catch the whole wave going down... is there a reason why you are using a 24 pip range bar? Nexas - would you say using as you suggested, 50 pip range bars, or basically anything bigger (like 40 pip range or 30 pip range, etc.) would have a greater than 7/10 strike rate? or would you say long term results would be unknown.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I am setting up profiles with 8,12,18,24,36 ranges. Picking trades with the cleanest look with my price channel. Also looking for trades with bounce off S/R. Problem with MT4 is it takes time to build up many candles with the larger range bars. Anybody know how to speed up the process of building up range bars? I'm just experimenting with range bars now. If I decide to make the switch, will probably use other charting like Ninja.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
smart, i've been thinking of doing that, cuz as i mentioned, i don't really have much time to trade typically. last week has been an exception. but gotta tell you one thing brother, mt4, it's the bomb when it comes to charting. problem is the brokers. so unless your doing this for fun, mt4 will definately be a problem when you put in the big dollars. there are constantly these 20+ million bid and asks appearing on my platform. I was close to peeing in my pants when i attempted just one 1 million trade (10 full lots, 100usd 1 pip). if you are profitable, and on an mt4 broker..... i doubt it's going to be pretty. so you might as well start with a broker that will make it happen for you long term, were you to succeed. I must say, mt4 is definately the bomb for charting. easy to use, free. problem is that it's also easy for the broker to manipulate it. news, blah blah blah blah. there's always some excuse from the broker, once a customer starts injecting bigger dollars into a broker who in turn controls the mt4 software which that customer is using.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi Scjohn, Yes with seeper retracements I usually wait until price reaches the previous high or low before I use that strategy. But sometimes it can be completely discretionary. Shallow for me is a negative r:r. If you wanted to test a different exit technique... you could look at using a 10EMA and exiting on a close the wrong side of it... I have played with this a little, but over time dollar wise it seems to be really quite positive. Let me know what you think. Nexas

--- 帖子 #628 ---
nexas, in the past, did you ever try trading your method, but using normal time bars? edit: i mean the reason i ask is, in my opinion, any trendline break strategy using time bars would not work without having a very good understanding of s&amp;r, and indicators, although lagging, would be necessary at least to watch the pointing direction of a CCI or MACD. but it's real hard for newbies to learn that stuff quickly. even if they could, they would lack the experience necessary to juggle so many decisions quickly (like myself). As a result, if you just go in on trendline break (worried you'll miss the move), all the pro's would be sitting on the sideline waiting to see what would happen after that.... price would probably hook for the times that the break's were real. That hooking action would take out the newbies (like myself) out of fear or uncertainty, whereas the pro's haven't even entered yet. In my opinion, with range bars, we would have entries which we cannot see using TF bars, our entry would probably be somewhere after a newbie has gotten in and before a pro would. This is what I was thinking this morning. Not sure if you think what I am saying is correct or wrong or anything to add. Have you tried without any ema's? since range bars basically show financial support... support...support, then the other way. I know taking directionless trendline breaks using Time bars would be stupid since it's just random, but with range bars, it's always about real money support followed by a fade, so would it make sense that even if a trade is going against the ema's, but, hey, if there is support in one direction on price followed by a fade, heck, just go for it. perhaps I'm missing something though, and just talking rubbish.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Thanks. I assume you mean less reward than risk. Do you take trading costs into account when calculating r:r? For example, on the 4 pip chart, the average risk is about 6.6 pips. 4 pips for the bar, 1 for the one back, 1.2 for spread and commission, and about .3 to .5 to actually get the trend break. So, in my world, reward (distance to the swing hilo) would have to be almost 7 pips to get to a 1:1 r:r on the 4 pip chart.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Scjohn, Yes correct. I like to have a positive risk reward including the spread and the 1 pip behind the high or low. Hence the reason I like more than a 4 bar pullback :-) Nexas

--- 帖子 #631 ---
hi nexas, I want to get your opinion on this: your tp exit point, for many systems, is the entry point. in an example of long trades, a lot of traders like to see the price go long, retrace and then go 1 or 2 pips above the previous high point (i.e. price making a higher high) before getting in. based on the way you trade, you'd be getting out with profit right around the time others are getting in on the exact same direction. can you educate me on this? thank you! and btw, last night was very good. i am unable to trade the 4 pip range. not enough risk to reward, and still too choppy for me. took a long trade on the 8 pip range not too long after usa open which would have offered 1:1 risk to reward, but I just pulled the tp line further up on the ATM on ninja trader to 1:5:1 one last question nexas, on the 4 pip range, you know how when you draw a trend line, and a current bar breaks it... then the current bar goes back below the trend line, and then the next price bar comes out below the trend line too... for me I will now redraw the trendline and extent it further... do you do the same? or do you not care and once price breaks and as long as risk to reward ratio is good, you will go in at the open of the bar? or do not even wait for the open of the next bar? i.e. once price breaks the trendline, you don't even wait for the next bar to open, you are in immediately? thanks!

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I was looking at a band like you are using just today. I was going to try a 13 SMA set at high and low with the 100 SMA on a 5 range bar chart. What are you using in your chart?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I've been using 5 Smoothed High/Low with 8 Smoothed Close Shift 5 ( the teeth of Bill William's Alligator). I've been using that for another strategy with time based charts, just trying it out with range bars.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Well, things have certainly tailed off at the thread. I was a bit surprised as I've been happily trading my filtered version of the setup and making quite a few pips. Why would people making money lose interest? Then, I finally got around to updating my trade journal and the answer became apparent -- money was not being made consistently (or probably not at all). Yes, there have been some wild days when all was golden, but the overall results of the unfiltered setup have not been good. I've been doing a lot of travel and very little trading in the last few weeks but I did get my journal up to date from Feb 9 (when I started trading my filtered Nexas trades on the 4 pip with an 8 pip guide) through Feb 27. This period includes a statistically significant number of Nexas triggers (100). In all cases the EMA's on both the 4 pip and 8 pip lined up. I used the entry and exit criteria I recently clarified with Nexas. I keep the journal on Excel which allows me to do quite a bit of analysis and even "what if" playing. I capture all triggers in the journal whether they were taken or not, so the results carry a mix of both actual (I was sitting at the computer and decided to take or not take) and "hypothetical" trades (based on reading the charts). Here are the results of unfiltered Nexas. Attached Image Essentially breakeven over 100 trades, although with 4 winning days and one very big winner. I've had problems with multiple pictures on one post, so I'll show the filtered results on another post.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Here are the results obtained by application of a few simple filters. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, the difference is rather dramatic. About half the triggers get filtered out and the results are rather nice. If you've been following the thread for a while, you know I've been an advocate of filtering trades and have posted multiple examples. It's late here now and perhaps no one is really interested so I'll stop here. If anyone would like to discuss the filters, let me know.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
SCJOHN.....I'm aware of you using the momentum indicator as a filter. Are there other filters, other than moving averages which Nexas uses, that you are using to filter out trades. I'm talking about indicators which might be in most charting programs. Also, am I correct in assuming these results were generated over a little more than two weeks. Keep on posting.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I have only just recently come across this thread and am very interested in the intraday range bar system. Thank you Nexus and all the others who have been able to contribute. SCJohn, I would be interested in you discussing the filters you have used. I assume you have been using non proprietary methods to filter the trades you have summarised. I have worked through your examples of using the momentum indicator as a filter (you have explained it clearly), however I have to say that I am finding it a little difficult to actually apply the techiques. Anyway I look forward to you discussing your filters further. David

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hi, very nice job Scjohn. Sure there is un interest in your filtering. personally, in addition to Momentum, I try also the Stochastics, and still looking for for an improvement. Keep on posting. Nice day everybody.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Hi Scjohn, Thank you for your update and indeed please talk more about the filters used in your results if it improves the bottom line by the magnitude you speak of! With regards to myself, I have been doing fine but I haven't been as active. This week I haven't even looked at a chart as I have had a lot of money put on ice for the moment. I had a large account with WorldSpreads who have just gone under, so I am just sort of dealing with the fall out of that at the moment. But I will be back in the saddle perhaps next week once my mind is little clearer. But again improvements like the ones you have spoken about are always welcome. Nexas

--- 帖子 #640 ---
The journal covers 13 days of trading from September 9 (when I moved my thrust trades over to the 4 and 8 pip range charts from the 7 pip range chart using the 10 minute chart as the guide. My thrust setup produces many more pips on the 4 and 8 vs. the old way. It includes all the triggers that I saw. Obviously trend line breaks can be subject to interpretation but I feel very good about the data (about 70% of which is actual vs hypothetical). In an earlier post I talked about struggling with using proprietary vs. freebee indicators. The problem is simple. I get FAR better results using the proprietary information and indicators (which can be had for the enormous sum of 495 bucks from Barry Burns) than I can with freebees. To ask me to not use the proprietary stuff is like asking a carpenter who has a nail gun, a fine assortment of power saws, and laser levels in his truck, to build a house using a claw hammer, a hand saw, and a plumb bob. It's not even close. Let's look at my three major setups over those same 13 trading days (again about 70% actual and 30% hypothetical -- still too lazy to consistently get up early to trade London). Without the proprietary information and indicators I got from Barry Burns, much less than a third of it would be possible. All the setups I actually trade use the proprietary stuff. Almost 8 am. Time to trade. Will post more later. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi Scjohn, Thank you for your input! All I can say is wow!!! I don't even have an 80% strike rate! As you guys are aware from earlier on in the thread,my new years resolution is to be more selective and increase the strike rate. I completely agree with your take on prop indicators. It makes sense. Do you buy them directly from this guys as individual indicators? or do you have to sign up to a course or something to get them? You have gone through your filters in previous posts but do you think you could summarize in a few posts here and now and then if you like I will update the first page to include your alternative? What do you think? Nexas

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Yes, I will do that but it will take a few posts. First, I'd like to talk about expectations and tell you why I'm doing this. Looks like I'm about to exit a short trade on EURUSD I took at 10:41 EST on a thrust signal. Oops, took another turn down. Runner's up about 50 pips as we speak. First -- I'm doing this to pay back Nexas for turning me on to trading the 4 pip chart which is producing considerably better results than my old technique. Second -- I'd like to develop a few more Barry Burns enthusiasts who can help me improve what I do. (As, you'll see, there is room for improvement). Third -- At some point, I'd like to explore a partnership with someone in the UK. I miss a lot of pips in the name of sleep. Runner just stopped out at +48 pips. Done for the day. Re expectations. The trade journal control panel I showed in a previous post shows what someone with a lot of trading courage could have done with the 3 setups (Barry Burns, Nexas, and Thrust). However, being a bit of a wimp, I trade it slightly differently. I usually exit half the trade at about 1x risk which costs me pips but makes trading much more fun and less stressful. Plus, once I bank that first half, I'm pretty fearless with the runners. I usually trade multiples of 4 lots which makes it all easier. Here's what it would have done (actual plus hypothetical) with the early exits I actually use. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, the total pips went down as did the reward to risk ratio. The win rate went up slightly. So, this is the wimp version. Note that, although the results are nice, 43 winning trades got away. So about 3 and a half times a day, I watch winning trades sail off without me. Of course, it's considerable comfort to note that the filters that eliminated those 43 winners also eliminated 135 losers and that the eliminated trades, as a group had rather abysmal results. But perhaps there's someone smarter than me out there who can figure how to keep more winners without adding a bunch of losers. Now here are the actual results with hypotheticals removed. Let's see if it will let me do two charts in one post. Has sporadically been a problem in the past. This shows part of what wanting to sleep has cost me -- and my journal doesn't even capture the first hour of London trading (no way I'd ever get up that early). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Time for lunch but I will get to the filters later.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hi Scjohn, Thank you for all of that! With regards to trading partners I think that is a very interesting idea and would like to hear how such a venture could work? I would be more than happy to trade the London mornings for you and then you trade the US morning for me :-) You get more sleep and I get to go flying in the afternoons :-) Look forward to your response and to the filters. Nexas

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I promise I'll eventually get to the filters but I think it's important to make some concepts and metric terminology clear. What the data show are historical results only. Although we have a statistically significant number of triggers, there is no guarantee that the next 5, 10 or even the next 100 trades will have a win rate greater than 80%. However, in the years I've been trading, I've found that using setups that had excellent results in the past have almost always made me smile later. The Nexas setups are relatively new for me, but Ive been using the Barry Burns and Thrust setups (albeit on longer charts but also with excellent results) for quite a while now. Although I show Reward to Risk Ratio on the model (calculated as average pips gained per winning trade divided by average pips lost per losing trade), be aware that I (like the 3 professional traders I trained with) consider r:r in isolation to be a totally meaningless number. Suppose I offered you the choice of two trade setups. One has a 3 to 1 r:r ratio and the other has a 1 to 1 r:r ratio. Which would you pick? You'd be surprised to hear how many new traders would immediately pick the 3 to 1. But now I tell you the 3 to 1 setup has a win rate of 20% and the 1 to 1 has a win rate of 80%. Now which one do you want? The much more important metric on the spreadsheet is Expectancy (calculated at (Avg Pips gained per Winning Trade X Win Rate) less (Avg Pips lost per Losing Trade X Loss Rate). An expectancy of more than 0 means the setup is expected to make money (but low expectancy promises a wild ride with big drawdowns). Some pros say expectancy has to be at least one before they'll consider trading it. Wimps like me look for 3 or more. Pucker factor is my own metric and shows how many average wins it takes to recover the maximum drawdown. Drawdown is one of the major reasons most new traders fail. No one told them that a setup that has a nice win rate of say, 65%, can be expected to string together 4 losers in a row about once every month and 7 losers in a row about once a year. And this is assuming it's working exactly as well as planned! Elementary statistical analysis tells us to expect this, but they assume their setup is not working any more even though it's a perfectly normal event. Note that the model I trade has had a not-so-wonderful reward to risk ratio, but great expectancy and a low pucker factor. Attached Image So please don't come to me saying that "I've been taught I need a 2 to 1 reward to risk ratio." Expectancy is what counts to me (and most professionals). Also note that the maximum draw currently shown is what actually occured during the limited time period of the data. With only 100 trades in the Nexas model, experience (and again, elementary statistical analysis) tells me there are bigger drawdowns in the future, perhaps as much as 2x the model's number. Back with more later.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Definitely worth exploring but let's get through these analyses first and see how you like the setups. Having someone trade a joint account (perhaps owned by a LLC) during the London session with me trading the US session is exactly what I had in mind. I think it's too hard to try to trade two accounts with a short trigger day trading chart.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Trust me, I'm getting to the filters but I think it's important to understand why something works, not just blindly follow a setup. The "why" is what helps you stick with the setup even when it goes through its inevitable rough patches. If you look at the upper left hand corner of the trade journal results page, you'll see a list of five factors. These are what we're trying to measure with our indicators. Think about what tends to make a trend trade succeed: 1) Are we with the direction of the trend? 2) How strong is the trend? Are there significant impediments to the trend: 3) Support / Resistance? 4) Is a consolidation period likely? 5) What about momentum? Is the trend strength increasing or decreasing? While it's possible to develop a profitable setup with only a couple of these factors considered, it's not likely to be a high probability one and will almost surely produce some bodacious drawdowns. On the other hand, trying to take too many things into account increases complexity, increases the danger of over-optimization (curve-fitting), and can be difficult to actually trade. So, as in most things in life, it's a balancing act. Although I take five factors into account, the way I do it allows me to make a go, no-go decision in less than a second, so it's not difficult to trade. Five factors, as long as they're all measuring different things, do not pose a huge danger of over-optimization. Using one and only one metric to measure each factor for each setup helps reduce curve-fitting risk. Have you ever seen a new trader's chart festooned with Stochastics, RSI, and CCI? These are all cycle indicators trying to measure essentially the same thing. There's an old saying, "Person with one watch knows what time it is, person with two watches is never sure." Another important point is that none of these indicators is ever actually "right" or "correct" or, by themselves, even useful. It's the agreement of the five factors (or at least most of them) that creates high probability trading scenarios. Look at the following attachment. There were 286 Nexus and Thrust (I've eliminated the Barry Burns trades as these are filtered differently) triggers during the 13 days. The 105 triggers where 4 of the 5 factors said "go" made 713 pips and had a win rate of 82%. The 181 triggers where 3 or less factors said "go" lost 759 pips and had a win rate of 25%. Now try to convince me that was merely a coincidence. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course the next logical question is, "what if we allow two bad things in a trade?" Attached Image (click to enlarge) What if we allow no bad things at all? All five factors have to agree? It's a very expensive way to increase the win rate. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And finally, what if we use no filters at all and take all triggers? The ultimate simple setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge) More tomorrow.

I've been enjoying your posts scjohn. Keep them coming. I totally agree with your last post on filters. I believe that in order to be a successful technical analyst, you actually have to do analysis. Most people just want to wait for a bunch of shiny indicators to line up, and be successful without doing any analysis. 2 of my favorite filters are volatility, and S&amp;R. Look forward to see more of your analysis.

Okay let's talk about filters. First we'll start with unfiltered Nexas trades on the 4 pip range chart with an 8 pip range chart guide. Entries and exits are as Nexas explained in his original post and in the clarifications he recently posted for me. In all cases, EMAs on both the 4 pip and 8 pip charts were lined up with the 20 on the correct side of the 60 and the 60 on the correct side of the 100. Let's look at the unfiltered case first. As the Nexas setup is essentially a scalping setup (close targets), the model suggests the best approach is to take everything off if profit reaches 2x risk or 13 pips, so we'll start with that. Of course, if it hits the hilo and then has an opposing color bar, it will also take profits there even if before 13 pips. Results are net of trading costs (spread, commission, and slippage) of about 2.6 pips per trade (the one pip back of the hilo Nexas uses in his stop is also included in this number). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although it had a heady day where it pulled in 63 pips and made money on 4 days, the overall results were not good. I did not do an analysis of the 8 pip setup but my perusal of the charts indicated moving up to the 8 pip would only produce a marginal improvement. The basic problem with any trend trading system that does not employ some kind of filter to provide early warning of potential trend changes (like momentum) is that they will do wonderfully on days when the trend does not change during trading hours and be massacred when trend changes happen during the trading window. Now let's apply all the filters (I'll discuss them later) and first require that ALL of them be in a "go" position in order to take the trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A much nicer result. 10 winning days, a few breakevens, and no losing days. 89% win rate but very few trades -- less than 2 per day in 6 and a half hours of trading. Now let's allow one (but only one) of the factors to be bad or "no-go." We don't care which one. (I'm sure there's some complicated formula out there that works better than this but I don't know what it is and it's probably too hard to apply in a manual trading environment anyway.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) While the win rate goes down and we pick up a couple of losing days, profits go up substantially and we get almost 4 trades a day. It also comes close to that magic "20 pips a day" per contract traded. This post is getting rather long so I'll continue on another one.

Now, the basic problem for those of you who do not want to use proprietary information or indicators is that one of my main setups (Barry Burns) is totally dependent on his stuff and my thrust trade filters are heavily dependent also. Although some of Nexus filters also rely heavily on Barry Burn's stuff, the historical model suggests there is a version of the filters that can be applied without the proprietary stuff that provides some improvement. Three of the filters: counter to DAD, momentum patterns, and to some extent into strong resistance, would require access to his stuff. If you apply the other two filters and require both of them to be "go" the result is significantly better than unfiltered and you may be able to improve it by applying non-proprietary momentum indicators. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although there are some actual trades in the data taken by application of other filters, I've not actually live traded this setup as I have the other three. It requires the 20 EMA on the 8 pip guide chart to be moving in the direction of the trade and that the signal not follow a "parabolic" move (about 30 pips from high to low). Consolidation periods often follow parabolic moves. The setup above is about all I can do for you with non-proprietary information or filters. Anyone interested in the other setups would have to purchase Barry Burns' first two Top Dog trading courses -- Foundation One and Two. I'm pretty sure I signed a non-disclosure agreement and, even if I haven't, it's not fair to give his valuable stuff away. The Barry Burns setups would come with the course and, once you've completed the course, I'll show you how to apply the proprietary indicators to my thrust trade and the Nexas setup. Taking the courses (last time I checked they cost $495 bundled) is not a casual undertaking. This is not some lightweight indicator shop. This is heavy training in market theory and market geometry. They come with 27 thirty minute videos and 2 manuals. Unless you're a lot smarter than me it will take you at least 2 passes through each video and each manual before it really starts to sink in. However, for me, the payback was enormous. I learned a lot more from this on-line training than I did in a one-week, on-site mentorship with two top traders. As you can see, in addition to his high probability setups themselves, I was able to significantly improve my other setups. When I took the courses about a year ago, he would not sell his custom indicators to anyone who did not take the course. In the courses, he shows you how to program his indicators (you don't have to buy them to use them), but I found it much easier to spring for the indicators also which I believe were another 3 to 4 hundred or so.

I received a private message indicating several folks feel I'm a shill for Barry Burns or perhaps even Barry Burns himself. I was afraid that would happen which was why I first tried to use off-the-shelf indicators to illustrate my points. Look at some of my earlier posts re momentum. But the problem was that they just don't work nearly as well. I assure you I am not Barry Burns. I have no interest whatsoever in his company and I don't make a dime on any of his products. But, given the credibility issue, I'm done here and I wish you all well.

It's great pity, it was very interesting. Hope the thread is not dead and also that scjohn will be back

Hi Tomlee, It is indeed a shame about Scjohn. I can't help but feel a little responsible as I did send him a PM, but more as a heads up about how people may perceive his last post rather than an accusation. I did explain that to him and he did mention that it wasn't because of my PM but because of others who were not very polite in their approach. I was trying to explain how participants of the factory can sometimes see posts like that as I have had similar experiences myself. So I can only apologize to to participants on this thread as his input was indeed very valid. Hopefully he decides to return. What we can take from his posts though is that there are a few ways to improve the strike rate of the system and although he has shown everyone one or two ways, there are a few others that can also help. I have never been one for indicators as I have done just fine with out them but I am open minded enough to see the possibilities. In fact a conversation with Scjohn last week where he asked me how I filter my trades as he can't necessarily see how it can be profitable without, got me thinking. My answer to him was yes I look at a few things but they are more discretionary and down to experience. I then understood that this is not something that new traders have the benefit of and hence, if I really want to help you guys I need to think of a more mechanical approach that doesn't include my experience and feel for the market. I have a few theories which I am testing out and will let you all know once I have finalized things, possibly later this week. I hope that all helps. Nexas

Hi Nexas, glad you are here, indeed it's always delicate here in FF with all this commercial stuff. BTW, what is the meaning of "counter to DAD" (in the scjohn's filtering) ? And I am also for scjohn decides to return. Nice day everyone.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Dear Nexas, Any progress yet on proposed indicators that can be used with this type of trading? Regards Ian

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Hi Ian, Sorry I have neglected this thread a little bit of late. It started to get a little ugly with accusations flying all over the place. Mainly to Scjohn which I didn't think was right so I took a step back. I don't really want to get into it all again so will just leave you with this short post which is to say that there are indicators out that help you make your decision on when to trade and when not to, but you still need a firm understanding of price action. I have looked at and tested Stochastics (7,3,3) and it works very well for filtering out cr*p trades. Wait for the pull back to S &amp; R, Wait for cross of stochs during a strong trend and look for the entry. I hope that helps. But I won't really continue to post on this thread as there seemed to be a bit to much bad blood (not necessarily in the thread but via PM's etc) Also before anyone asks I am still trading the same way using the 8 and 5 range bars :-) Love them!!!! Nexas

Hi guys! I've been following this thread closely for a while; it's a great system you have. I'm currently using MT4 range bar plugin with amazing success. This IS the way to trade for me! I'm just wondering if anyone knows if there is a mobile app that has constant range bars? I'm on the road a lot and it would be nice to check out the range charts. I think trade interceptor has them but they don't yet support my broker. It seems like every app is very limited in charting capabilities.

hi, could you share the range bar indicator? Tks

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hello I attached the range bar indicator that I use on MT4, theres a PDF as well that tells you exactly how to set it up, hope this helps Nexas, I have a little question for you! I've been using your system for a week now its paying off quite well for me. But I have this issue on MT4: when I try to place a SL, it says that my SL has to be at least 50 points away from the current market price... so I can't place any since when you enter your position using this system, your SL is really close to your entry point. Is this normal? Do you have the same problem with Ninja Trader?

Hello Nexas, Are you still trading with range bars? Over at the new thread you started, most of them are not trading range bars so I wonder if you have stopped using it.

Mmaker,post 665.

Has anyone seen or heard of an indicator that gives an audible alert when part way through a range bar? EG, if the range were 20 and if the alert were set to 10 it would alert for a take profit area or exit area if trading that way. Thanks if anyone knows - I have looked extensively and not seen one for the MT4 platform. Regards George

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Doesn't make any sense. Can you explain it a different way? You need an entry first before you can even talk about take profit or exit.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
OK. Here is a different way of describing it. If the setting of the range bar were 20 pips. A short entry is made at 1.5000 and as a scalper you'd normally be looking at the chart non stop. The target is 20, that is one candle. When the price gets to 1.9990, that is 10 pips profit, the trader may have left the screen and he needs an audible alert to bring him back to reconsider whether the 20 pip target is currently achievable. Does that make sense? George
