================================================================================================ Major update to thread on post #297 - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...74#post8604674 ================================================================================================ Major Edit - 8/11/15, 8/18/15 REPS trading rules - We've come to the point where we can put our rules to "pen and paper". We may find it necessary to tweak them as we go but I'm trading them as listed below in the attached explorer. This is a long term trend trading system with an emphasis on low risk, high return. Instruments - Just about anything that moves, but we may select pairs that tend to trend regularly (think Eur/Aud vs. Eur/Gbp) Trading Criteria - 1. Initial series entry Break of the 20 period Donchian Channel on the Weekly chart would constitute the beginning of a trend. Initial entry taken at that point. Position size at trader's discretion but the goal here is to make this a low risk, or in other words not a big hit to our trading balance. So I'm sticking with a low % of account balance. .25 - 2% would seem a valid range. Stoploss on initial entry (and all subsequent entries) will be the opposing side of the 20 period Donchian Channel on the H4 tf. 2. Trade management We want to get these trades to BE as soon as practicable. There's always going to be a trade off between moving to BE to preserve our trading capital vs. risking loosing a position by stopping out at BE. Look for market structure and price movement to help determine a good spot but should be around 50 pips depending on pair. EDIT 8/18/15 - Trail s/l on the H4 DC until BE 3. Add on trades New trades will be added on a break of the 20 period Donchian Channel on the Daily tf. Obviously not every break is taken. Location of trade will be determined when trade will allow for use of MM as discussed below. EDIT 8/18/15 Aggressive addon - If H4 DC pushes in opposite direction of Daily DC then reverses in direction of trend, then take entry on break of H4 DC with s/l at opposite H4 DC as always. If we are attempting to enter a trend that is already established we can enter on either of the above 2 criteria if conditions are met. 4. Money management Once our initial series entry is at BE and risk free we will use the floating profits from our position(s) to fund further positions. We will lock in via moving s/l 50% of our floating profit and use the other 50% for our next entry. For example, if we risk $10 on initial entry and then we have $30 of floating profit at time of addon trade, we would "lock in" $15 of profit and use $15 to open next position. Typically this would increase our position size each step of the way, while adding no further risk. EDIT 8/18/15 - If a trade is taken out at a loss then we only reenter using a MM reset to the lesser of the newly calculated entry stake minus the amount lost in previous trade OR our initial entry risk %...whichever is greater. ( Never put locked in "50%" at further risk in financing addons ) 5. Series exit When price hits the opposing 20 period Donchian Channel on the Daily tf this will signify the end of the trend and all positions will be closed. ================================================================================================ ORIGINAL MATERIAL - Going into the weekend on a "Dog Days of August Trading" Friday afternoon, I thought it might be interesting to develop a new...or at least revised...trading system with the input of the FF community. It seems typically as we develop a system to trade we look at charts and indicators and how they may tell us where the market is going and how we can enter. As the system evolves (or oftentimes devolves) we make changes and corrections as we are not arriving at our desired outcome in one way or another. So instead, I'd like to look at it the other way around, so to speak. We'll start with where we want to end up and see if we can't develop a way to get there... To start with, just a little bit about my trading style. I favor long term trend following. Ultimately I would like a system that's low maintenance (in terms of computer time), stress free (which means, among other things, low risk) and of course wildly profitable... Don't get me wrong...I like to dabble in shorter term trading, higher risk/leverage ideas, etc. etc. But that's mainly a past time or trading fix solution. For a go to, make a living system, those just won't work for me. Everyone's welcome to chime in and participate and share ideas. That doesn't mean I'll necessarily incorporate them in what I'm doing, or in this thread, but I fully expect to get some good ideas from you guys as hopefully I share a few with you. I just ask that everyone play nice and get along... So....off we go

So, for our first hurdle...or is it our "last" hurdle... Where do we want to end up. Take a look at these 3 charts Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) These represent significant trends that have taken place recently. Take a look at many pair charts on a long term basis and you'll see these long tail trends. Now there has been, and continues to be, much discussion and even argument on FF and elsewhere as to whether this type of price action is random, quantifiable, manipulated by power brokers, etc. etc. Frankly... I DON'T CARE. The important point for me is they do in fact happen on a regular basis. And in my opinion, they are...or at least should be...tradeable. So again, our first (last) goal is to get into these long term trends as soon as possible, and then trade the heck out of em on the way up/down and then get out with as much of the trend as possible.

When it's trending like that, I use Donchain Channel, set to 20 on higher timeframes, and 55 on lower timeframes, with 200 MA. That's it. You can either add to your position or take profit as it bounces around in the channel. Kind of like the Turtle Traders method, except not as many channels.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
MW...Thanks for your input. Donchian channels certainly have potential here...we'll look at that in a minute. Our first task is to look at these 3 examples. With the benefit of hindsight, what criteria would have kept us in these pairs for the bulk of the trend? For the purposes of our discussion, we'll term a series of trades in a given pair as...well...a series. So to determine how long we kept our series in this trend we have to first determine what would constitute our exit. We'll eventually be talking about 2 different types of exit. One will be in relation to our Money/Trade management and we'll discuss that later. But first we can look at exiting a series due to the trend (as defined by our criteria) being over, at least for the time being. So let's talk about possible exits for our 3 examples that would have kept us in these trends. MW mentioned the Donchian Channel with a setting of 20. Let's take a look. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So if we set up the criteria of exiting our series at the break of the Donchian channel we see that the E/N and G/U would still be active and ongoing. The E/U would have exited on the 28th of April after having been kicked out toward the beginning of the trend on the 30th of June, 2014. So we would have potentially captured about 2,500 of those 3,300 pips, depending on our initial entry. Not too bad. Next we'll look at Moving Averages. Any more ideas???

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Balls. If you really have a pair, you would add to the position at confirmation points (where the price touches either the upper or lower channel boundary, depending on if the trend is bullish or bearish). Add to the bottom bounce, if bullish; add to the upper bounce, if bearish. You could also take profit at these points, re-establishing a fresh position at the bounce. Actually, the real criteria are: if price breaks significantly above/below the channel boundary, or if price breaks above/below the 200 MA, you would exit the position. You could throw a stochastic in there, set to: 15,5,5 for further confirmation. Your initial entry would be after a couple of confirmation bounces, to avoid getting kicked out at the beginning, so to speak. You don't make the entire move, but enough. THIS ONLY WORKS ON CLEARLY DEFINED TRENDS. As someone mentioned in another thread, trends like this are becoming more rare, in modern markets. This is an old system and does not usually work. Typically, the price goes sideways or follows an erratic pattern.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Of course, you never know what will happen on the right edge, but here is my analysis - nothing new. The first problem is identifying the trend change, then staying in the trend with possible additions to the position and finally exiting. I'm attaching 2 charts which make up the entire trend on the EU. I think my notes show my method for the above stages. The EMAs are 40 and 15 with the 40 changing colour with slope. The first entry occurs when the first full candle is in the direction of the 40EMA and below the 15 EMA.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Whoaaaaaa...getting ahead of ourselves. Lol, but thanks for the input. We'll discuss entries in due time. We're just establishing a series exit criteria at the moment.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
this can be answer

Thanks for contributing PK. Let's look at some MA's. Here's our 3 examples with a 20 (red), 50 (blue) and a 100 (green) MA added. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If we're thinking of exiting on an MA cross, you'll see that on the E/N and G/U all but the 20 would have us still in the trend currently, just as was the case with the Donchian Channel. So we haven't gained any new information. On the E/U we see the 20 exiting frequently as we might expect and the 50 is kicking us out a couple of times. The 100 had us out on 4/28/14 as the DC did but keeps us in all the way down. We get a later exit on the 100 than the DC which cost us a couple hundred more pips on the later exit. So far the Donchian is giving us a better exit on these examples On the E

FT. Thanks for stopping by. Not sure where you're heading with this one. Perhaps you could expand on it?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Let me take a moment to emphasize my goal here. I'm looking at some recent trends that would have been very profitable as we shall find out. Based on those examples (E/U, E/N, G/U) how could we engineer a system that would have traded those trends with as much profit as we could. At this point the focus isn't on what may or may not happen down the road or on future trends. If we can maximize what could have been made on what did happen, I am confident that same system can be used in the future on what will happen. As the thread unfolds, if it in fact does, then we shall explore future trends using our REPS system.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
if a line respected 3 or more times in long term (4h and over). this is a good oppurtunity. Because big boys respect these lines. How to play is up to you .

--- 帖子 #13 ---
So what are you suggesting as the exit...and how might that apply to our other examples?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Well the thread has been moved to Trading Discussion from Trading Systems. So be it. There is a system here, I'm just going about it a bit differently. Ah well...we shall soldier on.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
When you find a line(in weekly monthly) you know that pair can turn from that line.See the move than enter .That move will be few hundred to thousand pips. but its boring waiting days weeks etc. or trade in 4h lines wait for one two days... So on...

--- 帖子 #16 ---
So let's move forward with the Donchian Channel for the moment for our series exit. If other ideas come up later we'll look at those. So to reiterate, we will exit all trades in a series when the opposite side Donchian channel on the daily tf is hit. Or more accurately we can move our group stop down as the DC changes. Having decided on a series exit, we must next decide how we would like to make our initial entry on the series. Now we can continue to use the DC, entering the opposite direction on the previous series exit. Or we can establish additional filter criteria. Some possible options are additional indicators, price action, higher TF analysis, etc. Let's consider.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
For the moment let's concentrate on the E/U example as it's the longest trend. Then we can apply our findings to the other. So first let's look at consulting a higher TF for clues on our initial entry. Looking here at the Weekly E/U with our same Donchian Channel we see the trend changed down on 7/18/14 at a price of 1.3503 We can see the entry point as we drill down to the Daily Note this is after the DC exit that we mentioned in the above charts. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
So for reference purposes going forward, let's identify the different segments discussed as we go. That way we can go back and modify a specific segment if we see the need. So thus far we have... Segment 1 - Trade series exit. Segment 2 - Trade series initial entry.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You can try to trade news, in-between waiting.... and probably lose what you gained waiting for your trend trades to play out.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Okay, since we've addressed Segment 2 - Initial series entry, we need to also talk about Segment 3 - Money Management There will be many aspects to MM that we will address as we go but for now we have to think about initial position sizing. As mentioned at the outset, I want this to be a low risk trading system. Low risk can mean a lot of different things to different people. To a large extent it will depend on you as a trader, your resources, risk tolerance, etc. There's umpteen threads about that. For the sake of simplicity let us begin with the assumption that we will risk 1% of our trading capital for an initial series entry. We can and will no doubt adjust this (I suspect lower) as we go forward, but, so be it for now. We will figure the initial balance in our trading account is $10,000. Trading the Eur/Usd our value per pip is $10 for a full standard lot, $1 for .1 lots and 10 cents for .01 lots So we are wanting to risk 1% or $100 So here's a representation of our initial entry point on the weekly chart with the entry candle on the far right. Attached Image (click to enlarge) We know our sell stop level, the lower donchian channel. We know we want to risk $100 for this initial trade, so to determine our position size we need to know what our initial stoploss will be. Again we have choices. We can use - Price action/structure ADR Set stop Other side of Donchian Channel on Daily/Weekly Anyone have any other suggestions.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
If you look at my trade viewer, you'll see that I've lost a lot of money trading EUR/USD, as it has moved sideways the last couple of months. I called the bottom way too early. I wouldn't even trade that again, until it decides what it is doing. You could try day trading it, or scalping, though.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Re: My earlier post I never said anything about MA crosses - I don't use them.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Agreed, but if you notice the Donchian on the Weekly, we wouldn't be looking to go long yet on the criteria we've set up thus far. But again, we're getting ahead.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I didn't mean the cross of 2 MA's but price crossing a given MA

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Right now I'm favoring Daily Donchian for the Stoploss, but we'll pick it up tomorrow. Night all.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Okay, so let's move forward with our initial series trade. Let's try using the opposite side of the Donchian Channel on the H4 TF as our stoploss. We'll see how this fit's into our modeling for successfully staying in the trend. This will also keep our stops lower, allowing a larger position size. As we see below our entry price on the Daily chart is 1.3505. The other side of the Donchian on the H4 is at 1.3628 which is 123 pips. We want to risk $100 so that's 81.3 cents per pip. With .01 standard lots on the E/U trading at 10 cents per pip our position size would be .0813 lots, or rounded to .08 .08 lots @ 80 cents per pip x 123 pips = $98.40 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello everyone, thanks spyderman for this thread. I'm looking and researching something similar. The donchian approach is good enough, but there are few problems that i found which are really hard to fix: 1) i enter when a candle breaks above/below the 20 DC. That's good, but no way we can have a low risk approach there. Example: EN daily on the major uptrend not over yet, on the first positions established we could have something like 12k pips SL. Here i'm assuming we jumped the trend early, so without any confirmation of the thread established. 2) If we used a exit based on the 10 donchian we would of course have a tighter sl, but we would get stopped out more frequently. 3) I even tought of trading without stoplosses at all, trusting the trend. But of course this way is unrealiable. 4) I'm going to experiment a monthly pivot approach + pa analysis. We need something: 1 absolutely low risk 2 which is able to create very long tails but at the same time we could enter with two lots in order to extract some profit in the middle way.

Lemming, Thanks for the input. I mentioned above about moving to the H4 for stoploss. This will naturally lower the associated risk. And keep in mind we're risk adjusting to stoploss size. We adjust our position to risk 1%, or whatever we desire, irrespective of the s/l size. At this point it's fruitless to look at example that "wouldn't" work at well. At this point I'm just establishing what "would have" worked in the given examples and then proceed from there. As we shall see as we continue, many trades will not work out. But we can still reap sizeable net profits from those that do.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Just to be clear... I have an endpoint in mind with this system already, that's why I mentioned in post #1 about "revising" a system. I appreciate all the input, as that's the purpose here. To get ideas that can improve and expand on the system. For example, I'm already using Donchian Channels for stacking positions to a trade series (Future Segment spoiler), but I hadn't thought of using the DC as an exit to the series. I was using an MA cross. Mr. White suggested the DC exit and it appears that may well be an improvement. So...onward and upward.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
The best trend indicator/MA that I have personally seen is Jim Sloman's natural moving average. That one is very cleverly done so that the initial exponential moving average's constant is changed by volatility, and from its appearance, it appeared to keep the trader out of trouble in minor pullbacks - more so than the indicators with fixed period such as usual MAs or the Donchian channel. I am personally not using any MAs, but if I woukd be using one, that would be the one. Another possibly good option is the median filter - much less influenced by temporary spikes... There are mladen's codes of NMA over at forex-tsd . I also got the median out from metatrader's site , just google them... k

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Okay so now we have our exit criteria. We have our initial series position open in line with our criteria. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now we move to Segment 4 - Trade Management Keeping in line with our desire for a low risk trading system, we need to look at protecting our trading capital by moving our stop to BE. Open to ideas here... We can choose an arbitrary number, a factor of ATR/ADR, Price Action/structure, lower TF donchian channel, etc. For the moment, let's use 50 pips to move our stop to BE. I've used this successfully in the past. So on the 23rd of July we move our stop to BE. Attached Image (click to enlarge) At this point our trade is at 0 risk to our trading capital, and so it shall continue. Next Segment 5 - Addon trades

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Good morning spyderman. Yes i know about what you wrote but i was still writing my post when you posted yours. Anyway. It seems to me that this is a ready system but i can't understand where we are going this way Addon trade? Just keeping adding with same rules only if the previous trade has the sl at be. Fairly simple and efficient i think . Thanks

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks again lemming for your input. There is an outline of a system here but my hope was to gather input on possible ways to maximize it in line with the original goals as set out. As mentioned before we've adopted the Donchian Channel as an effective series exit and that was a great contribution by Mister White. Where we are "going" hopefully is to come up with a trading system, after the fact, that would have traded the 3 examples given earlier (E/U, E/N, G/U) on their recent long trends (concentrating on E/U at the moment) both with low risk and high profitability. Then we can apply that system to forward trading and should be well placed to capture future long tail trends as they develop. Thus far, most of the ideas put forward have been unrelated to the example trends given and so it may seem that they are unappreciated or ignored out of hand. That's certainly not my intent...I just want to keep on track with the goals as set. I know this is a different way of thinking about it but hopefully it will be of benefit to those reading and participating if they have the patience to follow along. If not, then they probably don't have the patience to trade long term trends in the first place...JMO

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Okay, Moving forward to Segment 5 - Addon trades We have 1 position open in our series at .08 lots and it's sitting at BE. In keeping with our desire for a low risk system our main rule in adding on more positions is to not incur any further risk to our trading capital. To accomplish this we will only use any floating profits we have built in the series to fund further positions. Any profit used must be "locked" in by s/l so that if our trend ends or reverses and takes out our position then our trading capital won't take a hit. I think our 2nd rule should be to lock in at least some of our profits to the extent that if the trend collapses we walk away with a gain in our trading capital and not just break even. I've read LR Thomas' books on Forex and she presents the idea of using 50% of a previous trades profit to finance the next trade and thereby allow larger position sizes. As you roll that strategy forward to trade after trade you can dramatically increase your position size and profit potential without additional risk to trading capital. You are only risking unrealized gains. I don't think she applied it to a long series of trades like this, but I think it will be effective. So to summarize: When we wish to add a position to our series we will base our MM criteria (trade location, position size, s/l) on the amount of floating profit we have already accumulated from previous positions and we will lock in enough of that unrealized gain to guarantee that if all our stops are hit we will still "bank" 50% of the gains that were available at the time of adding our most recent position. I hope that makes sense. If anyone has any questions about it, or any ideas on how to better tweak the figures, then shout out. But hopefully it will become clear once we see it in action. So, on to the charts.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Looking at our Daily charts we a desirable entry at 1.33332. There's a break of the downside DC and a break of recent support at this level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Moving to the H4 for a potential s/l we find that our stop at the upper DC would be at 1.3411 or about 78 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If we were to move our initial entry to this s/l as well we would be locking in a profit of 94 pips (1.3505 - 1.3411). With a position size on that initial entry of .08 lots that gives us a value of $75.20 of floating profit (.08 x $10 x 94 = $75.20). We only want to risk 1/2 of that or $37.60. So with a proposed s/l of 78 pips gives us a position size of .05 lots ($37.60 / 78 / $10 = .048 then round up) So we place our order and move the s/l on our initial entry to 1.3411, the same as our 2nd position. Now if the trade moves entirely against us we have a guaranteed profit of $37.60. But we have the benefit of hindsight in this case and we know that didn't happen. The next day price breaks sharply below 1.3400 and we move our stop on the 2nd position to BE

--- 帖子 #38 ---
On 8/29/14 we see another entry opportunity as price hits the lower DC and again clears recent support at 1.3152 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's where we start to see the power of compounding this way. Moving to the H4 we see our top side DC s/l at 1.3222 for 70 pips. At this point our initial series entry has a floating profit of 286 pips or $228.80 (.08 x $10 x 286 = $228.80) Our 2nd position has a floating profit of 110 pips or $55.00 (.05 x $10 x 110 = $55) Total floating profit at our new s/l of 1.3222 is $283.80. We only want to risk 50% or $141.90. With a s/l of 70 pips that gives us a position size of .2 lots ($141.90 / 70 / $10 = .2027 rounded down to .2) If price turns and takes out our trades we'll still bank $141.90 on our initial $100 of risk. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A week later price makes a strong break down through the 1.3100 area and allows us to move our stop to BE We now have 3 positions open for a total of .33 lots. Now every pip we move down is $3.30 compared to .80 starting out. Again, all with no additional risk to our account balance.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Something to keep in mind as we move forward. Our series exit is the opposite DC on the daily chart. Thus far we've been moving our entry stops to BE to lock in profits to use in funding further positions. That s/l lock movement has kept our group series stop loss inside the opposite daily DC. So if our trades reverse we would be closing our series before the daily DC actually indicated we wanted too. That's the price of getting positions setup early in the trend with no risk. It will payoff big time if the trend continues (as we know this one did) because we'll have multiple positions early on. But as we move on we want to get our individual stops on past positions (not the most current since that stop is figured on the H4 DC) at no closer to PA than the opposite DC...in fact that's the place for it to be since we want to close all trades in the series at that spot anyway. Let's just keep that in mind. I'm going to do 2 more entries this afternoon to how those work and then we'll move on down to the trend finish line.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Sounds good so far. Do you want to use stops order for entries or entry on close below the sup/res? Anyway, for me the main problem is: ok let's play like this but this was a near perfect scenario for this type of trading. But how do we jump in the trend at early stages? We can recognize a good one just after 500 pips or so. Would be useful do a backtest to understand how many trades can be set at be, just to have at least an expectation Tell me if i'm wrong. Thanks

--- 帖子 #41 ---
No I don't think you're wrong about backtesting at all. I just think we have to define what we're backtesting. And you are correct about this scenario. Almost perfect. Cherry-picked. But why is that a bad thing. Why do we always come up with a trading system and then hope it will work well. That's my point in "reverse" engineering. Design something that would have worked well in one of these "near perfect scenarios" and then use that moving forward. As far as entering in trends at the early stages, we've established the break of the DC on the weekly would signify a new trend. Through a DC with a setting of 20 on a weekly chart and see how well that would signify the start of a tradeable trend. Granted, we'll start many that will either hit stoploss or perhaps get taken out at BE, but that's okay. That's why we're keeping our initial risk low so that we can be around for the long haul and be there when the super trends hit. There not as rare as you might think.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Okay so our next entry appears on 9/17/14 as prices pushes down the DC at 1.2857 Attached Image (click to enlarge) As we move to the H4 we see our top of the DC s/l at 1.2995 or 138 pips. Little bit larger stop but...that's where it is. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If we move our previous entries to that s/l as well we see we have floating profit on our positions as follows: Initial entry: 512 pips at .08 lots for $409.60 2nd position: 329 pips at .05 lots for $164.50 3rd position: 159 pips at .20 lots for $318.00 Total running profit is $892.10. We want to risk only 50% or $446.05 Divide that into our desired s/l and we get a position size of .32 lots. 1 week later we get a nice move down and we get to move our stop to BE on this most recent entry. Now we have a total of .65 lots running at $6.50 per pip. Again all risk free with a guaranteed profit of $446.05 It's also important to note that now our running stop loss on our previous positions is at the upper level of the Daily DC. So now our series group will not get closed unless we get a series ending hit of the upper daily DC. You may also note on the daily that price action in the middle of October is going to take out this most recent position at BE. That's okay, we'll still be in the series, but we will loose one of our positions. But we'll get to that later.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So for our last position we will go into detail on is to be found at the 1.26478 level on the 30th of September. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Our s/l according to the H4 DC will be at 1.2784 for 137 pips Remember we don't want to bring the trailing stop on our positions inside the daily DC now so for this trade the stops on positions 1-4 will stay where they are. So for this trade the floating profit we have to deal with is the same as before. $446.05. Since our desired stop happens to be almost exactly the same as trade 4, the position size on this trade will also be at .32 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) After a small retracement price makes a big move down on October 3 and we move our stop to BE. We're now carrying .97 lots with a value of $9.70 per pip. Again at no risk and a guaranteed $446.05 of profit from the series. Again we notice the price action is getting ready to take out trades 4 &amp; 5 at BE. So be it. We won't have any more entries until at least October 31st when the bottom of the daily DC is again taken out. I hope you get the idea thus far. As I haven't heard any other options to change anything I'll figure out the rest of the entries etc. (as I have time) for the remainder of this trend and post the results in full. Happy pipping until then.

Hi Spyderman Just wanted to let you know I'm really enjoying reading along with your project / experiment Please take this as far as you can as personally I always end up learning something new from those who are trying to look at things from a slightly different perspective. Adding on to trades has always been a sticking point for me but the 50% method is new for me and I like it. cheers Sunny

Usually these big swings are on diverging monitary policy... For example Aud entering a rate cut cycle... or Usa planning to raise rates, while ECB starts printing. Or Jpy starts printing endlessly. That's the fundamental driver that pushes these swings so far so fast.

Okay, so I ran the possible trades through to the DC exit. Some got closed out at BE along the way. Here's a screen shot. Prepare to be skeptical Attached Image (click to enlarge) We ended up with 7 entries. When closed at s/l they shook out as follows: 1st entry at 1.3505 for .08 lots. Total of 2,470 pips. Profit - $1,976 2nd entry at 1.3333 for .05 lots. Total of 2,300 pips. Profit - $1,150 3rd entry at 1.3152 for .20 lots. Total of 2,120 pips. Profit - $4,240 4th entry at 1.2247 for .36 lots. Total of 1,220 pips. Profit - $4,392 5th entry at 1.2066 for .82 lots. Total of 1,033 pips. Profit - $8,470 6th entry at 1.1750 for 1.04 lots. Total of 720 pips. Profit - $7,488 7th entry at 1.1270 for 6.23 lots. Total of 240 pips. Profit - $14,952 Total profit - $42,668 with an initial risk to capital of $100. Obviously we were fortunate to not hit any s/l's along the way and got all our trades to BE. Let the flaming begin...

The deal is to keep things above water until this kind of run ... So no mater an early exit ... it will happen most of the time ... The nice run will make this worth.

Perhaps this is not the right time to ask, but I'll ask anyway How will you decide which pairs to watch? I know it must be taken with a grain of salt but could it be useful to scan through some of the larger banks 2015 2016 forecast prices and see which pairs might potentially have the largest moves forecasted. just a thought

A tough question. The long term trend opportunities for the last 15 years or so lie in XAGUSD, XAUUSD, EURUSD, GBPAUD, DJI30, S&amp;P500, GER30, BRENT, BUND et al. They appear to be commodity, indices and treasury note heavy but we do have some eligible curency pairs such as EURUSD, USDSEK, USDSGD. AUD pairs, CAD pairs and NZD pairs in general (excluding GBP/USD related pairs) have been woeful and signficantly impede portfolio performance....however NZD pairs are showing some recent trending opportunities. Granted this is from the benefit of hinsight but if you wish to be instrument agnostic then I would suggest you test various instruments using a roll forward back-testing approach. For example, back test years 2000 to 2003 for a particular instrument and if it stacks up as a trender during this period then run a test blind for the 2004 year or until the trend you are on ends. Then rinse and repeat using say 2001 to 2004 to test 2005 etc. etc. This way you are avoiding the propensity to curve fit and more fairly assessing your trend following portfolio approach. The key requirement for long term trend following approaches is risk management during non-trending periods. You never know when a trend sets off so you need to be ready to trade when your system tells you to....and drawdowns are a necessary evil....so risk management is crucial. That's why I always side on risking a very small % of risk capital per trade. There were extended non-trending periods between 2000 and 2010. The last 5 years and in particular the last 2 years to current times have been tremendous for trend following strategies. It is a bit misleading to backtest from 2010 on as this biases on the plus side trading performance of trend following strategies.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sounds good to me, but i'm a little bit skeptical not because of the theoretical earnings but because of the near perfect scenario this system needs. Anyway, this is a perfect candidate for an ea. All rules are objective and if you want to apply this to multiple ccy pairs you need it. Also, how to manage the MM without an ea. Would be very difficult. I have two other questions: 1) the first one but seems obvious, just for confirmation: so we enter only when the closing price is below the donchian right? In this case we need a fix, because a lot of times what we have is a trend in which the new highs just move up the donchian but candles don't close well above/below it. So each new day we have a higher dc but price can't close above it (well, the dc of the day before, being impossible that the price closes above the current day high). 2) If we have 10 ccy pairs and we want to enter in 5, how to use the unrealized profit? They will belong to all of them, should we count just the ones coming from the current currency pair we want to jump into? Thanks man, your effort is admirable.

Throw a DC on some weekly charts and see what they reveal. Here's the 1st 2 I pulled up. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Do you see tradeable trends there. Granted the E/U we used is an extreme example, but again that was to define a strategy. There are much shorter trends that will still yield profits. I'm going to start testing the waters this week. It will of course take a while to get this rolling due to the long term nature of the system. Plus this is a notoriously slow time of year. But we have to start somewhere. I have a live account that I'll be attaching to the thread as an explorer. I'm going to request FF to put this thread back into Trading Systems or maybe Journal.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hey Lemming. Thanks for the questions. 1.) I use the break of the DC channel and maybe add a couple pips. We're looking for momentum breaking a previous high/low, so not concerned about the candle close. 2.) Yes each pair series stands on it's own. So you might have a series in trend that's trading some larger positions while you are starting testing another pair with your 1% or whatever you decide on.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Copernicus, Thanks for you comments. I agree whole heartedly on the MM aspect. Have to keep the initial risk low. 1% may be too high. Ultimately, I'd like to be in the .25% area on initial series trades. Unfortunately I'm starting with a smaller account of $1k equity. So with a minimum position size of .01 lots I'll be risking a bit more depending on my s/l sizes. If things go positive I'll be adjusting that down.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi spyderman. Nice thread. :-) We are on similar missions. The shorter term Donchian exit within a longer term Donchian entry filter is a robust method that certainly keeps you out of the rough and ensures you capture any trend of significance. If it is any help, these are the findings I have come across over pretty extensive testing and they may be useful for your strategy. 1. There is a direct relationship between increasing noise and the timeframe use, being that preferable timeframes for trend following now need to be longer (as opposed to a shorter duration). The sweet spot currently on D1 with most traditional trend following methods appears to be approximately 200. The reason for this requirement is one of avoiding noise through attempting to identify legitimate price action bias. This is also evident when looking at various timeframes for trends and seeing a direct relationship between better trends and longer timeframes. The longer timeframe serves to smooth the noise. This therefore has implications regarding the settings of trend filters that seek to eliminate noise and capture volatility such as Donchian entries, moving averages etc. Increased use of trade algorithms, platform technologies and globalisation is increasing randomness at the short term timeframe and to avoid the churn, you need to work outside this noise. 2. Trade entries are not as important as methods to keep you out of the rough. It is easy to lose track of this principle with trend trading and think that the entry is important. The Donchian trade entry filter is powerful not because of its trade entry definition but because it keeps you out of sideways congestion which hampers any trend following strategy. For example, if you have a filter that can eliminate trading the sideways congestion, then other trade entry techniques such as trade retracement entry can be particularly powerful as it allows you to leverage position sizing while keeping within trade risk % requirements. In fact I would suggest that any trade entry into a trend is as good as any other (provided of course that you can keep out of the rough). 3. Anyone in hindsight can identify trends that they 'should' have traded, but in working on the right hand side of the chart, while respecting the principle of letting profits run and cutting losses short, it is a difficult exercise in achieving this balance and staying on a trend for the long term. Random price movement (noise) is the greatest enemy when you are also attempting to minimise risk. You need to develop trade management methods that allow price movement to breathe but in turn, expect to sacrifice performance in achieving this aim. Overtrading and intervention kills trend following. 4. Use of moves to breakeven etc. as a way to manage trade risk as opposed to using a primary exit mechanism such as a break of the shorter period Donchian or a MA crossover etc. are a two edged sword. Yes, they manage risk.......but they also significantly compromise profit performance. It is a tough decision deciding what to do and I have used long range testing as a basis to determine my stance on this. I have found better results in terms of lower drawdowns and improved returns from interfering less with trades. Testing is demonstrating to me that the primary exit mechanism should be the only tampering you do with trade management. For example, use the short term Donchian exit as a basis for stop setting and position sizing. Locking in moves to breakeven while in principle sounding good often disrupts potential longer term profitable trade entries. Given random jitters that are built into price movement, letting price breathe is crucial for trend following. Interestingly there appears to be a direct relationship between performance and trade tampering. The less you tamper, generally the better. This has deeper roots in the principles of overtrading which are a trend traders worst friend. 5. Adding to trades in trend can also be a two edged sword for performance. Where there appears to be merit is when you add to trades early in a trends development. When the trend ends, those recent trade additions inevitably get clobbered and sacrifice total performance. You might want to consider maximising the number of trade entries you employ for any given trend. The principle of only adding positions only when the prior trades are profitable if closed out is a good one but consider limiting entries to a maximum number using this principle. While there will be a few instances where some excellent long term trends allow you to pyramid extensively, the impact of continuous trade addition on trends means that you raise the benchmark on the required trend conditions you need to effectively harness this principle. It will work in your favour with some beautiful trends.....but they are few and far between. The profit potential on most other trends will be significantly reduced with continuous trade additions. ....anyway, best of luck spyderman. I don't think you are going to need it however as your logic and intuition in applying this to trend following are shining through. :-)

Hello Spidey, IMHO that is a mistake. You are aware that random data can produce trends just like you have cherry picked? Without any stats to design a system around, how can you have faith to last through the randomness? You would do better if you started with stats and then explored systems around those stats - then you are moving outside of the randomness and shifting probability in your favour. This is not reverse engineering. With kind regards, MK

--- 帖子 #60 ---
MK, Appreciate your thoughts. Have to say I disagree however. You speak of randomness producing trends as if that would somehow discount the opportunity. There's much debate here on FF and elsewhere as to how random the market is or isn't. As I stated earlier, I just don't care. It is immaterial how/why long tail market movement happens to me, the point is that it can be traded. Those trends happened, random or not, and they will happen again. The "stats" that are important to me is what the price did in fact do and, at least in my mind, represents what it will do at some point on some pair. It is around those stats, market movement, that I explored this system. To me, we are reverse engineering in this respect. Typically I see folks design a system and then backtest or forward test to see how it does. We are taking an end product, a sustained market movement in a given direction (trend) and then designing the system from that. Then I can have a measure of confidence that, when another sustained market movement comes, my system can and will trade it with a high profitability. Cheers

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Sure, randomness will happen again without a doubt. My point was strictly about a starting point for system development. The stats you speak of that are important to you....well I haven't seen you post any yet. I have seen many many people developing a system like this: grab some random hindsight data that looks good and they wish they could have partaken in, develop a set of guidelines/rules that seems to work on their cherry picked examples, walk it forward in real-time or worse trade it with real money, after some time has passed they wonder why the system is not profitable and it doesn't come close to matching their exploration. What you are doing in this thread, is the common way I have seen traders develop a method/system. If instead you started with a proven statistical market tendency, you can at least start the long and time consuming process of developing a system with a chance. I've been full-time trading for 12 years now and have seen this play out many a time and been subject to it myself many a time as well. I'm not trying to insult you or poopoo on your efforts. I'm trying to save you some time so you can re-direct efforts towards something with a chance. Nothing else to do but go back into shadow I guess. Good luck ahead.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hello MidKnight, i would like to step in in your favour. The thing is that you're right, he's picking up a cherry picked scenario. But i can also say that this isn't that bad. You want a system that works in such an environment because you want to extract as many pips as you can from THAT scenario. No doubt that the system won't work with a ranging or non trending market. Actually, it won't be succesful also in a weak trending scenario. But those are the periods of time in which you just want to preserve your capital. Does anyone remember Graeme's thread? It was illuminating. The only thing you need is to keep your risk controlled. Then the inevitable will happen. Of course i've been Always skeptical about his methods, but they can theoretically work. I also would like to point out that we could further improve our odds of being right. How? Using monthly pivot points. Heres a little part of my findings (only on GJ, so Im assuming something that might be wrong based only on this CCY pair) The probability that the month will be green If Open&gt; PP (and viceversa) is slightly above 50%. Also, 75% of the times the PP is touched. This means that if we open higher than it we need to know that 75% of the times the price will go down and touch the PP. Another thing to exploit is R1/S1. These are, also visually, points in which usually the price stalls or retraces. So why should we open there a position knowing that probably the next day we will be able to open at a lower price? Were away from S1,R1? Ok lets open at break of DC. We are on them? Lets wait. Simple huh? I have an excel sheet with all these statistics if youre interested. Also, please tell me if this contribution is not appreciated.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Great post, thanks for sharing. I didn't understand one thing. When you talk of 200 do you mean the DC 200 on daily charts? Essentially you're right, but if AUDUSD changes trend right now we won't be able to jump on it until 40 weeks. About the rest, i think you're essentially in line with the following: NO RISK NO REWARD. But at this point, having so much risk, are we actually sure that a simple entry method based on engulfing, inside bar, Flying buddhas isn't better? We would have much lower risk per trade, and we could only select opportunities in a trending environment. Example: Break of the DC but than retraces, IB/OB/FB bullish and we jump in. If we want to not overtrade with just 4/6 pos per ccy pairs this is really suitable. The good thing of entering at every break of the DC is the immense scaling in we have. Even if we loose on the last positions are we sure this isn't still the most profitable way?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi lemming :-) The 200 D1 periods relate to the average extent to which indicators used to detect persistent price anomalies (trends) need to encompass to ensure the sample size is sufficiently large to "on balance of probability" pick longer term sustainable trends. This figure comes from some of the recent trend studies using extensive price series and also seems to agree with some extensive backtesting of a large number of instruments that I have undertaken with a very talented EA developer from this forum....*just in case you are looking*... Inside bar breakouts are very appealing to me (and to Peter Crown et al), but in reality, you can set your distance to stop at any arbitrary value to maximise leverage provided you are trading in the direction of price bias, have miserely stops and work on the principle that the Law of Large Numbers is on your side. I am not so dependent on price patterns on the short term timescale as I find it exceptionally difficult to determine what is random price movement and what is not....not discouraging others, but this is just my own personal findings. Edit.....If you look at your patterns and adopt the same principle in reducing R (distance to stop) without adhering to the patterns themselves but establishing strict entry rules on 'random entry' into a trend....then I totally agree with you...... In essence you are seeking to maximise your Reward to risk ratio trading in the direction of price bias and being prepared to significantly reduce your win:loss ratio in doing so. My current Win:Loss ratio is barely reaching 30% but the trade expectancy is excellent....so I think we are on the same page here. One of the key reasons I like a Donchian break is that you 'ring fence' price and ensure you catch every trend of substance... What I am really struggling with at the moment is not trend detection, but trade management during trends. In riding great trends there are numerous times you close out of the trend after watching a peak unrealised profit disappear while waiting for the trend to bend. Of course if you harvest these peaks you potentially cut the trend short etc......and I am just having to suck in the fact that this is a requirement of trend trading....*grrrrr*. A further significant struggle is in seeking to flatten the equity curve with trend trading. As we all know....the times between trends can be significant.....and the drawdowns can be painful......however are there are other ways to manage drawdown without having to compromise your trend trading technique by diluting it's potential through traditional risk management measures such as reducing your position size etc. For example, with a portfolio, you have the ability to 'harvest some successful' trending instruments to flatten the equity curve....however once again you are interfering with the profit performance of those successful instruments. I am really wrestling with this at the moment and wonder if anyone has good ideas on this. One of the things I am thinking is that you may be able to run tandem strategies such as a trend following strategy and a mean reversion (shorter term) strategy so hopefully while one doesn't perform, the other does....but there must be better ways to do this without interfering with the power of the traditional trend trade.....or am I just being too greedy :-) Anyway, I don't want to derail the thread but some of these issues will need to be addressed by Spidey as he develops this technique.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
It's all a matter of priorities. Do you want to NOT interfere with the trend? Just don't do it Open a position, no stoploss, no takeprofit. Just have FAITH in the trend until you're proved you are wrong. Do you want to preserve capital? Just put sl to be and let it go. Plus, we are not considering something which i think is very important for this type of trading, which is FUNDAMENTALS. Let's all admit that all the best recent trends started with fundamentals. EU NU AU GJ UJ. Each one of them has started with a fundamental fact, because that's how you piggyback institutional traders on that timeframe scale. You are looking to the shortcut for the undeniable assumption which has Always proven correct: No risk No reward. I honestly think this is not the way we should think about that. In the optic of reverse engeneering a trade system: who would have made the most money in the last year and a half? Who strongly believed in the trend and on the fundamental shift between economies. The same one who started selling eu at the break of 1.4. Tell me if i'm wrong. Let's think about the most vivid example of this kind of thinking. Jesse Levermore gained fortunes in a period in which i don't think stoplosses were used. And he lost them all. And he regained them. As i said, it's all a matter of priorities. What do you want more? Risk less or get a higher reward? I don't think you can have them both ways.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I hear you lemming I have no doubt that fundamentals are driving the long term secular trend...but I am hopeless at making sense of it all and don't have the necessary inside info to capitalise on it so .......I cheat using the long term monthly trend as determining my bias. I also do agree with your no risk...no reward statement and inevitably come to a trade-off point in that sense.......but I am a greedy bugger :-) For example speaking of AUDUSD, look how I have ring-fenced the bast***d on multiple timeframes....that is greed talking. I just hate letting them get away. Those horizontal lines represent my alternate approach to Donchians.....but whether you use Donchian breaks, Standard deviation channels, moving averages or whatever....the result is fairly similar for trend followers.

And it's not going to be any different. You can jump in whenever you like. Doesn't change anything. The only thing that changes is the risk. How to minimize the risk?

Copernicus...Lemming Don't worry about derailment. The points you bring out are valid and interesting and I'm sure will help some in the process. Copernicus, Been thinking about some of your earlier comments about moving to BE and limiting trade entry. You are of course correct that by moving to BE you cut down on the breathing room of the trade and may well lose entries that if the trend continues on, would payoff handsomely. My concern, however, is that with the aggressive MM that I'm employing here of compounding our floating profit to finance ever bigger lot sizes, not taking a "loss" becomes more critical as it effectively takes us back to our starting point...after banking our 50% profit. For example, remember this retracement in Red that took out a couple of our BE entries in the upper half of our trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It would have been nice to have those entries still there as the trend ended up continuing. However, that retracement would have taken out at least 1 trade at s/l (see post #43) which would have derailed our compounding to that point. So, yeah, it's a tough choice. On the point of limiting our entries to the start of a trend I'm running into the same situation. Due to our aggressive compounding, it's those later entries at higher lot sizes, that can really pay off. Granted at the "end" of the trend your recent entry may be taken out for a loss (only 1 if we're moving to BE) but at least we're locking in a 50% payout. That last entry made late in the game for 6.23 lots had a + $14k payout and would never exist if we cut our trades short. Again, it's a tough choice.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Lemming... I think you mentioned earlier about an EA. I don't think that would work on this. It's true that most aspects our mechanical, but there is still much discretion on trade entry point. We're taking the break of the daily DC, but not every break. We have to have sufficient room from previous entries to move to BE, move s/l's down, etc. Price is moving so fast in some areas that our s/l on the H4 would be further away than our BE on a previous trade. Notice the circled area here. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I see exactly where you are coming from Spidey. That area you highlighted is the bane of my existence at the moment as it represents a great harvest opportunity but that can only be said in hindsight. I am tending to think that your move to BE is perhaps a good technique when dealing with multiple entries given that some of the early entries may be able to get through those trend retracements. Have you thought of perhaps dividing your trades into trend trades and swing trades. For example let's assume you have released 4 trades on a particular trend. Could you reserve half of them for swing trades that have a profit target installed while reserving the balance of trades for the long term trend ride with no set profit target to let the profits run. In fact when thinking about this say the initial trades entered are reserved for the entire trend but the more recent trade entries are employed to ride the swing segments with profit targets. That way you might be able to at least get the benefit of those inevitable retracements you get during the long trend trades......just thoughts :-) For example those strong exponential trend movements (eg. XAUUSD chart below) are rarely captured by the trend follower as the exits wait until the trend bends. With a combination of both trend trades and swing trades on an underlying trend, you perhaps could take advantage of these crescendo moves at the end of trends without seeing this unrealised profit vapourise in front of your eyes.

Well, it depends. Are you sure your second strategy would have a positive expectation? I wouldn't be that sure without data backing you up.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Ah now that's the question..............but this is a brain storming session isn't it?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Into the breach you go Spidey. Best of luck. :-)

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Yes, of course. In that spirit, here's what i think: Using the rules we've given so far, that strategy won't work. If we use stop orders we need momentum to back us up. If we don't get it we can't go anywhere. We would be in markets hands. The hold indefenitely strategy would work because of the astonishing risk:reward implicit ratio. But this second one would need very far target in order to be positive in expectancy. Assume just this: 200 pips stoploss (might be average using 4h channel as stoploss). Breakout entry with stop orders (imho this will turn in a 30% success, which i mean price to keep going with momentum without stalling). In this case you would loose 200 pips 70% of the time and how much you need to gain to be BE? 466 pips per trade. Just to make breakeven. Of course would not be 30% success, because might be slighly better given the times price comes back without touching stoploss and break above in gain again. Does this make sense to you guys?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Good luck man, really. I hope you'll succeed

--- 帖子 #78 ---
It probably overcomplicates things. Simple usually is best. I must say however that I am not a fan of pyramiding entries later in a trend and need to get em' done earlier in trend development to focus punching power up front and then let it ride....unless you use them to augment profit performance with less ambitious targets:-)

Loved Graeme's thread. That's what really got me started thinking about longer term trading and stacking trades.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Spidey You might be interested in applying an anti-martingale progression to your trends such as the Snowball which was developed by a very talented chap here at FF (7bit). Unlike a Martingale, it manages risk well and is excellent as a discretionary tool for trend trading. Like a move to breakeven, losing trades are closed out for a single level minor loss while trade entries that survive trend retracements prosper. It is effectively like Graeme's equity milipede approach applied to progressions in releasing lots of small trades with strict trade risk parameters hopefully allowing a few to get through for the long ride and can really boost profitability without significantly compromising drawdowns. Attached is an example on EURUSD that visually demonstrates how it works. The EA is used as a discretionary tool for the manual trader and can be found here https://sites.google.com/site/prof7bit/snowball with a forum discussion here . The chart below uses your Donchian but translates these to D1 timeframe so we have a 20period donchian on W1 represented as a 140 periood donchian for entry on D1 and a standard 20 period D1 donchian for exit. You simply turn on the progression on a break of the 140 period donchian and turn off the progression on exit. The approach is almost a mirror to yours but more aggressively pyramids profits. Better still, you could turn off the progression (rather than keeping it going the whole way along the trend) as you get deeper into the trend to further manage potential drawdown impacts using this addition. PS I should have exited earlier (as I just missed the Donchian 20 exit) but for the purposes of showing you how it works, I think you will get the picture.

Nice thread!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi guys, I'm following this thread since its beginning. I really like spyderman's trade management. Long time I was searching for a pyramid scheme which doesn't increase the risk. I studied 7bit's snowball up and down. It looks great on paper. Unfortunately the asymptotic performance hides an awful linear drain on the account. This linear loss depends on the future volatility and can get bigger than the quadratic profit at the target. I mean that at the target exit your "winner" may be in a net loss! A truly negative RR! This DD is clearly seen on the backtest by Copernicus. Remember it is a cherry picked example. With Spyderman's way the risk is known at the beginning and after the first addition a small profit is guaranteed. Even if no trend emerge we may get a small profit or a well controlled loss. In the backtest, the balance DD is approx 50% yet the peak floating profit is half of the realized profit in the example given by Spy'. No contest.

Good advice PipMeUp. Thanks for that. I do see how the Snowball fails on less volatile trends as it can't get ahead of it's break even. :-)

Welcome JMN...Pipmeup Update on E/C trade. Moved to BE Now we just let the market decide...and of course, root for a climb.

After some revisions to Post #1, we're back in the "Trading Systems" forum. Thanks Twee

And...we're out at BE.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
When you entered the position your SL was 230 pips. This gives room for the trade to breath. But as soon as the price reaches 50 pips profit the SL gets very close to the PA. No more breathing. Additionally 50 pips on E/C are not the same thing as 50 pips on E/G. It isn't related to the volatility. What about using a DC 20 on H1 and trail the SL @BE when the channel is fully above/below the entry? Coincidentally for the E/U example this would have been around 50 pips. But for your E/C you would still be at risk (good or bad time will tell) Your thought?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Exactly. Also 50 pips on E/U in 2015 are not the same thing as 50 pips in 2012. Another way to solve this problem could be by basing your SL off an ATR value to account for the volatility of different pairs.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Yeah, I've been thinking about it all day. I realize I was too quick on the BE. At the very least I could have waited for some structure to form support. We had mentioned the H1 Donchian earlier. So you're saying just use it as a volatility indicator and move stop to BE when the H1 channel has cleared price? That would seem to be more in keeping with the flow of the series in general.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Yes, that would work. I think I like the idea of sticking with the DC's. Looking to hear back from Pipmeup to make sure I understood him correctly.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
So here's another wrinkle to work out. What do you do about entering (or not) a trend once it's been on it's way for awhile. For example here on the Gbp/Nzd, it might look like the trend should be exhausted. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not so much when you zoom out though Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm thinking perhaps we should start a new "leg" when the weekly DC gets hit again. Obviously if we had been closed out of a series on the daily that would mean that price has come down/up off the Weekly extreme, thus perhaps setting up another trade series. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Morning from here Spidey Treating each trade as a seperate series on a trend isn't a bad idea. For example with the earlier post 66 using multiple timeframes on EURUSD different timeframes can be deployed to ride a single trend. The advantage of this rationale is that as volatility changes along a trend, each trade therefore adapts to the changing volatility and also the various timeframes used ensure a staggered approach to entry and risk is configured to each timeframe providing the required breathing room associated with each timeframe's associated volatility range. While post 66 provides a way to operate 6 different trade series on a trend (assuming 6 timeframes used), your approach can deploy the same rationale if you treat each trade as a new series and use say ATR as a basis for position sizing. Doing so ensures that each trade adapts to changing volatility along the length of the trend. Also I have low risk tolerance by nature and if it was me, I would tend to get progressively more risk averse as the trend extended and establish conditions such as reducing position sizes by decreasing trade risk% of additional entries along the way to dilute the risk at the moving end (right hand side) of the trend. This way my effort is made up front and therefore time in trend becomes your friend.....but that's just me....and others would strongly differ in that view. Good to see that this thread is getting more contributors. Many heads are better than a few and it is great seeing a strategy unfold before your eyes. :-)

So I think PipMeUp has a good idea on the BE move. We'll try moving our stop to BE after the 20 period H1 DC has cleared our entry point. In regards to trend continuation, my goal here is not to predict price movement, but to follow it. Therefore I can't really know if one break of the weekly Donchian Channel is more promising than another, so I will treat each as a separate trading series opportunity. It's going to produce a lot more trading opportunities and time will tell if that's a good thing or bad. This is definitely a work in progress, so we'll monitor as we go.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
We reverse engineer a perfect trade but no position survived between 1.25 and 1.29. It isn't that perfect! The reason is obvious: the trend wiggled. Is it possible to hook a few trades in there without increasing the risk or aborting the series? I wondered how we could enter the retracements with the tools we have, i.e. the DCs. I got an idea. What do you guys think about this: when the DC on D1 is still going down but the DC on H4 is going up we enter at the B/O of the H4 channel. Picture: (green entries survived, yellow taken @BE, no loser) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hmmm. Definitely aggressive stacking. I'll look through the chart for the trend and see where that leads. We greatly increase profit potential but at the same time obviously increase the chance of hitting our s/l at loss and loosing our trade progression momentum.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Fully agree. This H1 DC clearing the entry point should give the very first position enough room ...

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thanks for the input FerruFx. Much respect

--- 帖子 #100 ---
So taking a quick peek through our series chart it's seems we'd add the following entries. All would have got to BE. Now some may not have been taken due to trade spacing from previous entries and some would of course get taken out at BE, but definitely would have added some positions. I even checked the end of the trend where price eventually turned and closed the series, as I feared we may have a loss down there...but we didn't Nice find PipMeUp. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT: There were a couple more entries down there in the junk at the bottom of the series that I forgot to circle. Both went to BE and then stopped out.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Nice move PipMeUp. :-)

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks guys. I agree with Spy' that it may be too aggressive. I'd like to find a way to not get the whole pyramid destroyed if such an entry fails.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Well, yes, it's greater risk, but the point in using our E/U example was to maximize the trend opportunity and mold our system accordingly. In keeping with that philosophy, it would seem that it would be an improvement. Granted, in forward trading, it may take us out of a series earlier, but then again, it may pay off as it would have in the E/U trend. Well, I'm off to my day job (at least for now ) I'll check in later.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
To be less aggressive, why not simply adopt both entry conditions (the breakout entry of the primary Donchian and the retracement entry of the H4 DC) as legitimate primary trend entry points, set initial stops at the outer H4 DC and move to BE when H4 DC reaches the entry price of either condition. Only consider new entries when BE on prior trades have been reached. Trend ends still on breach of D1 DC. You should be able to pack more profitable trades into a trend this way while still strictly managing risk. Using the H4 DC you are also ensuring that trade entries are positioned where trend momentum on D1 is in your favour.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I just had fun paper trading E/U in 2008-H2 only using the H4 B/O entry. Only one single of those aggressive add-ons would have stopped out the pyramid. But almost at the bottom! One of them died at BE after a floating profit of 805 pips (aaaaah). Only very few survive but we're reaping pips per the thousands!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
B**gger it. Let's be aggressive. PS To keep out of the rough I still like Spidey's 20 period Donchian on W1 as a basis to initially enter the trend.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
They seem to be best when the channel is narrow. When it is wide a W1 trendline B/O looks like a good option. Start drawing the TL from a pivot which is also a pivot of the whole DC. EDIT: well not so good in the end...

--- 帖子 #108 ---
How about a profit target for those retracement entries to harvest those nice trend impulse moves in conjunction with a trailing stop.? Bed calls. Night guys. :-)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Dunno. Wouldn't this turn a trend following system into a swing trading system? Not that it is good or bad, just that the idea is to catch the big whales. Also we must keep in mind that the power of the system comes from the MM. If we take profit too early the "half of the locked profits" that fund the additional entries stops growing. Yet I hear you, watching a 800 pip runner returning to the BE line is sad. We could partially TP at some point but the next entry will be smaller. We need to compare the bottom line in both the cases. Good night-

--- 帖子 #110 ---
That's exactly the beauty of the MM. Once the 2nd entry is triggered, we are in a risk free ride ... no matter if it continues or reverses at this point ... no matter how many positions we might have during this ride ...

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Love the brainstorming here guys. So if we're moving our stop to BE when price clears the H1 DC then wouldn't it make sense to just trail at the upper H1 DC, rather than just wait till it hits and move it all at once. Now part of my philosophy with this is not to be sitting in front of a screen all day, so watching the H1 DC every hour doesn't sound appealing. Wonder if there's a trade management EA out there that handles DC's. I don't think Steve Hopwood's does. In any case I would think it's advisable to at least trail the H4 DC. Of course that brings up the issue of what to do with the trade progression if our stop gets taken out somewhere between our original stop and BE.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yep. Guys, we need an EA for this so at least we can long-range test options across a basket. The rules are sufficiently rigid for an EA. I am ok for the crunching if someone could program a bot and many heads can assist in interrogating the analysis. Following that, if everyone is happy we could look at a Portfolio Manager/ Dashboard. It could be fun and is a great way to engage the diverse skill sets of this community. :-)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
PS As with all trend following systems, it is going to be the volatility of returns we need to deal with and I would love to see a brains trust get together from this forum to work on this.

Trades entered this evening. Back in Eur/Cad and now Eur/Nzd.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi guys, very, very interesting ideas being developed here. Sorry, I won't be trading along with you BUT this has given me a great idea on how to pick the direction for a Grid trading EA - it has a Sell or Buy only setting, so once I determine direction plus when and where to turn it off, then it should be good to go. And if a longer trend develops, so much the better. May the pips be with you

--- 帖子 #116 ---
This is quite simple to catch the trend and only one indicator is needed on the chart. The key is the large stop but the bigger secret is the trailing stop. I used to day trade but I never knew how to hold positions and finally I had an ahhhhhh Haaaaaa moment. Emotions and trading do not mix so the method that I use on live accounts is mechanical and all I do is set my pending orders and let it run its course. You only need one moving average. The 50 simple on the Daily and a 300 Simple on H4. 300 Simple is the same as 50 on H4. Trail the stop with the moving average. sometimes the stop will only move 3 o4 4 pips. Another method of trailing the stop is the SAR but I have tweeks for that ride. Intuition and trading do not mix...just when I think it's going one way it goes the other way...The market rules so let it rule and ride it out. I don't want to but in on this but I would love to share some ideas. This is a great what you started here. Some traders need to be in a trade all the time and everyday. Maybe this is it.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
If you trail the SL above the BE and get stopped out you need keeping track of all the losses you took and take them into account for the next entry lot size. That makes things quite complicated, just my opinion. That's why I prefer jumping at BE in one step. Also if we trail too early we offer our SL to the market. Another option is to open two positions. When DC-H1 cleared the entry both SL are set at BE. One of the SL is trailed with DC-H4. Again the final profit is limited in the perfect scenario. But this may increase a bit the capital as well in the other cases. When the "big day" comes we have more money for the 1st entry. The two entries don't have to be equally sized but it makes things easier. I dislike trailing all the SL of the series to the DC-H4 when we add a new entry. The risk of aborting the whole series in a near perfect scenario is too high. Let's not waste an occasion that only appears after months. Say we trail the series with the DC-D1 while the addons have their SL at the DC-H4. We will have cases where this SL is hit and the series isn't stopped. The loss is rather big (50% the locked profits). How shall we manage this when the next add-in opportunity comes?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Nice......but by having a SL for each individual trade at the DC-H4, if the trend bends to exit at the DC - D1, unfortunately we are still going to be dipping into our cumulative profits from the surviving progression (that represents the distance move from the DC - H4 to the DC - D1). At least we are not knocked out of the progression entirely and there is a chance price will resume back in trend, .....so how about this........As we get deeper into the trend and reach the next 'add-on level' we progressively widen the trade management DC at each leg with the objective of ultimately coinciding with the D1 - DC if we get this far to reduce this final profit leakage as the trend bends. For example, the first level add-ons (2 trades) can be managed with an initial SL at the DC - H4, then for the second level add-ons we move to the DC - H8, then DC - 12 etc etc etc to progressively expand the trade management DC to hopefully ultimately conincide with the DC - D1. As each prior series moves to BE, the new add-on position sizing would be appropriately scaled using the same trade risk% based on distance to the expanding DC, thus slowly creating more room to breathe for each sequence and thereby more aggressively protecting the floating profits as inevitably we know the trend will bend. This may be unnecessarily complicating things...... but the principle of progressively scaling up position size utilising 50% of floating profit appears to me to be probably too much overkill which is likely to enhance the volatility of returns given the infrequent nature of these type of trends.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
The problem remains. If the addon SL is hit but the general SL isn't we lose 50% of the locked profits. The risk I see is that we may insist in entering in a weakening trend and give back all the money. Three failed attempts that's 87.5% of the profils lost! If the addon fails, we close everything. The whale may escape but the boat doesn't sink.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hope it works out for you Erebus. Thanks for stopping by

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Pip, Let me clarify. When I mentioned trailing the H4 I only meant until the trade was at BE. The overall D1 trail would stay in effect. But you're right, it would complicate the MM on a partial loss, but at least it wouldn't set to zero.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
If you can clarify the final thoughts up to now, I can put together a simple ea to test the idea and share it here. If you like....

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yeah, I don't want to overcomplicate. Thus far we are wanting to trail at the D1 DC. That way all entries are exiting at the series "end". Rinse and repeat in at the next Weekly DC break. That's still the goal as I see it. I think moving addons to BE (even if that's inside the D1 DC) when the H1 DC clears entry is solid. Even if we hit the BE without a series end retracement, we haven't damaged our MM progression, just lost an entry (as we did in the E/U example) So the only real question is, to trail the addon entry s/l until it hits BE, or wait till it clears the H1 and move it all at once. If we trail at the H4 at it reverses to a partial close... Let's say we had a $100 initial risk as in the E/U template. At some point in the trend we have $1,000 floating. We lock in 500 and want to risk 500. Place our position accordingly and then trail the s/l with the H4. We trail 1/2 way from starting s/l to BE and then price retraces to take the position out, so we loose $250. But the series doesn't close. So we have $500 locked at the D1 DC and $250 left of our previous partial loss. Do we then look to re-enter using the $250 or go back to the original $100. We for sure don't want to put any of the $500 lock at risk. Takes more math, but we're trading on higher TF's so shouldn't be as much of an time issue.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hey GTH, Thanks for the offer. Do you mean the trade management part? If so all we would be talking about is a Donchian Channel trail. User should be able to select DC period and which timeframe he wants. Also would need an option to stop the trail at BE or better yet BE +(n) pips. Would need a "ticket number" selection so it only trails that specific trade I don't think we'd have to complicate it more than that for now.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The ticket number option is a little hard for me at the moment. I use StrategyQuant's EA Wizard, so that option is not possible with this software at the moment. Sorry for that....

--- 帖子 #126 ---
No apologies needed. Appreciate the offer. Without the ticket number it would move all entries on the pair with the H4 (or whatever tf) channel. That would take our s/l's inside the D1 DC, which we don't want.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Sure, I get you point.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Here's an example on the E/N trade. We're obviously running at a loss at this point. S/L was set at the H4 DC at time of entry but volatility has slowed down and the H4 channel has moved up. We're talking of a 180 pip difference. To trail or not to trail...that literally is the question Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #129 ---
The budget to add was $500. We lost $250 of them. So we should reenter with the $250 remaining. We trail the DC-H4 only up to BE(+fees) and only when DC-H1 is fully below the entry. i.e. we can stop trailing temporarily if price retraces a bit. This way we reduce the risk without suffocating the trade.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hey Pip, You lost me a bit there...I thought before we had decided before to move the stop en masse when the H1 DC cleared the entry So are you saying not to do that and just trail using the H4, but only start the trail once the H1 has cleared. That would seem to be even more conservative than even the straight H1 clearing move. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
We didn't discuss this point. BTW I notice MT4 doesn't draw the DC properly. The channel is to be drawn using the last known candle not the next (future!) one. Correctly drawing the channel shows that you would have started trading on the 18th of May and you would have ridden the move. The first entry was on the Thu, 28th 12:00 UTC (my candles are UTC) with a 230 pip SL. 2550 pips floating today. You would still be in the trade since DC-D1 was never touched. =&gt; It is a missed opportunity. Too late.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hmm you're right...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I'm showing the Weekly DC set here off the 2/1/15 weekly candle at 2.09344. Breached on the 21st of May. Are you using the close/open or the high/low for your channel? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Off to work...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yes it is. The current values are the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows of all the 20 previous (and closed) candles. ------- Regarding the trail at BE. Here is an example of the 3 options: (orange=D1, green=H4, black=H1) Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT: not trailling at all is a winner

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well to me BE is almost a winner. It gives another soldier (as Graeme would say) to fight the battle. In this case the H1 clearance would have been taken out at BE while the other 2 would take a partial loss. I don't know. I think I favor the H1 clearance at this s point. I'll mull it over this weekend Don't really think no trail is an option for me

--- 帖子 #137 ---
When the entry is stopped at BE not only we don't lose money but it gives an opportunity the re-enter the same amount of risk either at a better price or with a smaller SL (because DC-H4 has time to catch up). It is perhaps a good thing actually to be stopped at BE: this prunes the tree to get bigger fruits.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
looking briefly at our E/U template, trailing the H4 would have taken out the last entry in the trend is a very small loss versus at breakeven. So in this case a quicker move to break even would have saved a few pips. I'm not at my desk top right now, but when I get back I'll figure how many dollars lost for that, and the percentage of the trade

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Well I take that back. Seems it would have hit BE after all. Also checked the H1 clearance BE move on our E/U template. Due to the stop moving rather quickly it seems one of our earlier entries that otherwise survived till the series end, would have been taken out early. This would of course have diluted our MM progression and cut into our final profits quite a bit...although not greatly. So at the moment it seems the most robust method, at least in terms of our E/U template, is trailing the H4 to BE. So that's what I shall do on my live trades and we can monitor the performance live.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
E/N stopped out this evening.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
We defined no rule to re-enter nor whether to re-enter or not. The B/O on E/N is still valid to me. Looking at the daily chart 1.6800 is an interesting level. H4 seems to be preparing a bullish engulfer above 1.6800. The SL would be around 90 pips. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I agree that we still have a valid trend to be in. In post #92 we addressed the similar situation of entering an already moving trend and I think the principal is valid here. In the E/N case as an example...If this hadn't been our first entry that got stopped out we would still be in the other positions as the daily DC did not get breached. We would be looking to add a position on the daily (with a modified MM due to the stop loss). I think that approach is in keeping with the general system idea. So here I would be looking to enter at the break of the D1 DC with the stop below the H4 DC, just like on other trades. Or we could use the aggressive entry as you discussed. Since the H4 was broken downward, and the D1 is still rising, we could take the break of the H4 with an H4 stop. In this case though the H4 and D1 highs are the same...at least at the moment.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I don't have time this morning, but I'll sit down and summarize the additions/changes we've discussed thus far so that we have a clean plate moving forward.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Spyderman, thank you for this thoughtful, considered and risk controlling approach. I have a similar daily system that quite closely follows your approach but using the supertrend instead of your DC. Like you to I'm in the mid-stages of tidying up some of the unseen decisions I need to add as the system evolves. But this is your thread so I'll stop now. It is helpful to me to hear you guys think out loud and I am learning new insights and find these insights can stimulate other ideas i can consider. So I am very thankful for all your detailed process. One of the many good things I think your approach has is the risking a small fraction of your account at the beginning and adding as it goes in your favour. I read somewhere a saying that has been a constant general filter for my own system. "start light and get out obese but don't start a diet on-route" In normal speak enter a trade with light risk and then load up as you move into profit but don't scale out (the diet) as you are moving in the right direction. So many do the opposite, enter with their full risk and as they move in profit they scale out. Well no right or wrong way, we all see things differently and that's a good thing, but for me the adding to a winning position makes for good common sense. I especially like the 50% of profits being used for a risk free addons. Nice! Pipmeup was very generous a few months ago putting a similar idea into a spreadsheet for me on a 1min fun idea i'm working on. So Daily for growth (hopefully) and 1 min for a micro account bit of serious fun. The first place i heard of this was a internet article years ago about Ed Seykoda the famous trend trader (Market Wizards fame) who use a portion of his running profits to finance his addons so this idea has a sound pedigree. So this is just, I hope, an encouraging post to cheer you on from the stands since I don't have anything of value to add at this stage it looks as if you are well on your way. Perhaps though I could tentatively echo something you have said earlier I believe, for this to be a robust system over the longterm I think you need to keep things on the simple side, it makes for a more mechanical approach that I think emotionally is easier. Keeping on the weekly daily and H4 also allows you to not be glued to our screens (my own approach looks at only the Daily EOD). But as I mentioned you have said this yourself so all good. Once again thanks for what you are doing here.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
One last thing, don't know if this contains the n% of profits/addons info but it should be interesting reading if you like me love all things risk and MM http://www.seykota.com/tribe/risk/

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I agree silverpuma. The preciseness of placing the add-ons using MM is very appealing to me and is a nice change to standard more haphazard pyramiding that often compromises a nice long profit run. Spidey and PipMeUp's thought processes here have made me hone my own approach and I really appreciate it :-)

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Copernicus I read the full thread a few days ago so am I right in thinking you mentioned something about have a swing approach within the overall major trend you are riding. Especially at the end (though i appreciate only hindsight can see that) when perhaps the position size is significant so that there is some simple way to not let a large % leg/swing of the unrealized profits slip away. I just mention this again because you have opened up another avenue of consideration for me that I had not considered.....thanks. Maybe I'll open a thread to get some help probing and pulling at the possible merits or otherwise of this since i am more of a short term swing trader within trends than spydermans more pure trend trading approach here and so its over and out from me

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanks for the words of encouragement SP. Feel free to chime in any time. I'll definitely take a look at that Seykoda article.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hey guys, I've edited the trading rules in Post #1 in line with our discussions. See if I missed anything or if I need to change the wording to make more clear. Some of it's a bit tangled without staring at a chart.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Given the inevitable volatile equity curve that trend trading delivers, you can overlay alternate approaches on top of trend following systems to stabilise returns. While you can diversify trading approaches simply through the adoption of a portfolio of different systems offerring different trade profiles (eg. running seperate systems in tandem), it is preferable to integrate these various alternate systems (such as mean reversion strategies or swing trading strategies) into an underlying trend following system to ensure that when one system is entering a drawdown phase, another system element is delivering returns. This way you can better manage portfolio performance and configure this portfolio of systems to deliver required investment objectives. CTA's such as Campbell and Co use these techniques to specifically structure performance objectives to meet required objectives. However despite the apparent ease of the theory, the practice of achieving an optimised equity curve is a difficult exercise. Of course it is quite easy to flatten the equity curve if you are prepared to sacrifice returns delivered by the underlying trend trading strategy by effectively subsidising the shorter term mean reversion of swing trading strategies.....however this is not an ideal method but often necessary when dealing with cantankerous investors.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Looks good but the ultimate arbiter needs to be PipMeUp. :-)

--- 帖子 #153 ---
That's Spyderman's thread. He is the only arbiter...

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I'm trying something in demo with E/CAD. To explain it you shall have a look on E/J weekly first. As you can see, E/J W1 closed below the DC in January and again in March. It didn't broke the top of the DC yet. Therefore the down biais is still there. But the price retraced 1350+ pips since it broke the channel. I'd like to find a way to catch this "minor retracement". And more importantly avoid to enter short again and again by following the rules when it is abviously wrong. I'd like to not add any indi. The idea I had is to draw a horizontal line at the last DC break. When I'm not in the market (usually because kicked out from my first entry) and the price is the other side of the line, I use the same rules but to go opposite. I want to play the upthrust. I'd like to see if the H4 DC is wide enough to not be washed and rinsed if the market forms a congestion. I opened a short (counter-trend) on E/CA at the break of the DC-H4 because the price is now below 1.4495. H4 broke at 1.4435, the SL is 1.4614. Following the rules, I also entered a long on U/C. Aggressive entry. Right on the top! rofl. The price is now below the line in the sand (at 1.3100) but I've not being kicked out thus far. Therefore the long is still running (and under water by 85 pips).

Have an aggressive H4 entry on the Aud/Usd. Daily channel (gold) has been moving down steadily. H4 (light blue) pushed up without hitting the daily and then broke the bottom. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Keep us posted. My concern would be that the movement within the bounds of the Weekly DC would be a "ranging" environment and could move back and forth indefinitely. Taking the weekly breakout (or sticking with it until the daily break) would be a trade with momentum on our side. Will be interesting to see what you discover.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I agree ... In this kind of long term strategy, we must first be pretty sure price went outside the weekly range ...

--- 帖子 #158 ---
This is the very reason I choose this pair. I want to see how the system behaves when it is caught in a "washing machine" PA. case 1 - I get kicked out every time I swap the direction, so many losers I won't recover -&gt; my idea is proven wrong case 2 - DC-H4 is wide enough to keep the number of losses in a managable size and the breakout gives me just a bit more than I lost -&gt; my idea may be considered with the addition of discretion/fundamentals... case 3 - DC-H4 is wide enough to keep the number of losses in a managable size and, thanks to the MM, even a moderate breakout gives me an interesting profit -&gt; my idea can be added to the rules

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I hear you Ferru. But look at the chart. According to the rules it is a down trend. Do you really want to keep entering short positions in this market?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Yeah, wouldn't want to be adding shorts here. But we would have been taken out of our positions at the break of the upper daily DC, thus ending our "series". Then we wouldn't enter again on that pair until we had another weekly break...up or down. That's what I intended, perhaps I didn't intimate that clearly in the post 1 rules. So if we get a series ending Daily DC break, we don't go back in on that pair until we have another "series" setup as in Rule #1.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
If an entry is due on the lower TFs as per the rules ... Why not ? But in this precise case, the initial entry is definitively out at this level ...

I missed this you're right.

Entries taken on U/Cad and G/Cad with aggressive H4 entry. This is the 2nd position on G/Cad. 588 pips locked in with 233 at risk. The 1st G/Cad position actually pre-dated the REPS inception and was from my previous trend following. It lines up with REPS though and was on this account so I shall go forward with it.

As the thread moves forward and more positions are discussed, I think it raises a possible terminology issue into focus, and that is the use of the term "Pip" As shown in our E/U template we are locking in "pips" as we go along to finance further positions. But locking in 500 "pips" at .01 lots is a lot (no pun intended) different than locking in 50 pips at .5 lots. I feel that one of the most dynamic factors in the system is the locking and stacking aspect, so I want to be clear on what we're referring to on given trades. I also want those following along to be able to relate the process to their own trading situation. So referring to $ locked in won't have the same meaning to different size account holders. Any ideas to keep it simple and at the same time accurate.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
What about normalizing in multiples of the initial risk? For instance I risk $25 on the first position, this is the unit. If I trail a series of SL to lock $53.6, I locked 2.14 units (53.6/25). It give the same value whatever your account size, whatever the SL and the size of the various entries and whatever your percent of risk is. The final result for your trade gives the effective RR of the series. This is a measure any trader understands.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Ha...great minds think alike I was thinking of calling them pipunits. Like in the E/U example the first position of .08 lots would be 1 pipunit. Sounds good to me.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
That would be the best way to define it.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
H4 aggressive entries added on the E/C and E/A

I would say it's a bit early to make any determination as to overall profit/loss, but thanks for contributing

Yea, It is early for that i know... That's why i said, will you mind more ideas to improve it? Thanks, Noobshow.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I think I've been clear from the outset on the direction of the process. Many have contributed along the way and we've incorporated those into the system. Of course I want to keep those contributions in line with the original purpose. We're using the E/U trend from last year as the template. If you have any thoughts on how that could have been traded more profitably, than by all means, share them.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
E/N and E/U both up +330 pips. Would love to move to BE but H4 DC still trailing far behind. This is where sticking to a system takes discipline

Things looking well so far spiderman. Interested to see if you can get a few addons running with compounding. I did some maths on a 4 hr chart with a cherry picked perfect trade just to see how it "could" make a difference "if" I could apply the 50% addon rule to my own variant of your idea and the results where so amazing I rechecked three times as I thought it must be a mistake. To be honest the sceptic in me says I could never do it live but the maths doesn't lie. So I see it as an encouragement and a movator even if in my case extremely unlikely with my modest ability. I had 1 trade with 4 addons with a range of 14-20 pip Stop Losses and a total pip range from entry to exit of 269 pips so much shorter TF. and with a 100 risk I ended up with 26,625 I had to laugh, the chicken in me would have found it very very difficult to place those last large position trades and emotionally I could not really do it at this stage at least. But nevertheless the maths holds true, in my case on this relatively short trade I would have a Risk of 1 for a reward of 266 that would cover a few losers...! Don't worry I gave myself a pinch of reality and am back to normal now. Seriously though I really do wish you well in this and hope those addons and compounding kick in with the resulting multiplying factor. I think even knowing these "possibilities" are a good antidote when you have a string of small losers or BE's to keep taking the next trade. The knowledge that 1 good trade could cover a multitude of small losses is emotionally strengthening. At least that's how I find it.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
You shouldn't ... Once you place the 1st addon, the whole run is risk free no matter if price reverses immediately. Remember that the addons are playing only on the floating profit of the previous (and still) opened trades. Assuming you were talking about the initial MM discussed in post #1 ...

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I agree FerruFX but we are all different and I have to be honest with myself so I know "I shouldn't" but with risking 50% of, in my cheery picked experiment I'm made of weaker stuff I guess

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Totally understand SilverPuma... It's easy to sit here and say to let it ride but it will take a lot of intestinal fortitude to stick to the plan. On our E/U template we talked about the huge payoff at the end, but didn't really address the much larger floating profit that would have been there at one time before reversing and closing at our Daily DC break. Just that finally entry that survived until the series close...it ended up netting us $14K, but at one point it would have been caring a floating profit of $50K before reversing. That's not counting the other entries. I didn't run the numbers, but I imagine it would have been close to $100K floating profit. That's a lot of cheese to give back to the market. Problem is that if we don't stick to the MM we'd never have been in that position in the first place. Everyone has to handle there own MM in line with there own circumstances and personality. One possible adjustment that you could make on your system is to increase the lock in percentage as the series goes along. Perhaps locking in 75% and risking only 25%.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
You must be reading my mind I just found this quote from good old Ed Sey Seykota again in my hunt for a solution that would keep the addons principle but adjust risking less after 2 or 3 addons. He offered the advice....." Pyramiding instructions appear on dollar bills . Add smaller and smaller amounts on the way up . Keep your eye open at the top" . This of course suited him and his personality so as you said each of us will have different comfort levels. My own idea is open to change after more reflection and gathering of advice but I like your idea of risking 50% of profits, but maybe I might do that for the first 2 addons (if I ever get to that stage!!!) and then incrementally reduce the % o floating profits risked something like, addons 1 and 2 risk 50% and then further addons risk 40% 30% 20% and keep using 20% if any more opportunities appeared. Now there's some hopeful thinking...... Well its nite nite for me....

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I ran the numbers real quick, just to see how it would work out with a declining risk %. 1st 3 entries stay the same. .08 lots .05 lots .20 lots Next entry would drop from .36 lots to .28 lots 5th entry drops from .82 lots to .46 lots 6th entry from 1.04 lots to .38 lots 7th entry from 6.23 lots to 1.76 lots. Final profit banked goes from $42K to about $22K

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thanks for doing that spyderman, very interesting and revealing. This gives me more to chew on. No doubt in that particular sequence of trades the $22K reduction in profits might be as emotionally challenging as placing the full 50% trade (nice problem to have though ). I suppose for me all the "ifs" and "maybes" really need testing in the live environment to see which approach will suit my personality and not just the theory of contrasting ways. As you said above giving back $50K or $100K of floating profit has its own challenges even with the fantastic eventual return outcome of £42K. Like most things its a balance and to try to squeeze the optimum out of every sequence of trades is near impossible. There just is no way round keeping the cake eating it as well. I need to make my choices, live with the compromises and stick to the rules. I appreciate your help in allowing me to think out loud here.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
The home run template made 42K from $100. That's 420R. If at some point you're sitting on, say 650R, you're much better than the perfect score. At that point you can "Keep your eye open at the top". For instance using a trendline. It's no greed, fear or indiscipline: you made much more than the expected maximum.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Yes pipmeup seems like a common sense approach, I like that.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
The problem comes in applying that "eye on the top" stance too early. With the benefit of hindsight we can apply it at the bottom of our trend and start looking for reversal indications to get out sooner. In real time we might likely apply it much earlier and leave the trend. Like in our E/U template, we may have never made it to the bottom. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It's definitely a nice dilemma to have, but one we'll have to deal with. As you mentioned, SilverPuma, each of us will have to make those choices as they're presented in a live environment. There's going to come a point (hopefully ) when those lot sizes start getting pretty large, at least for my trading experience. I've thought of maybe skimming some profits off the table at some point, reducing the %risk like we've mentioned, tightening the trailing stop, etc. It all becomes arbitrary at some point upon leaving the system MM, but that's the reality. It will be interesting if we're all still around here at the thread once that problem presents itself.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes spyderman its sort of a catch 22 argument. In hindsight we can point to charts that would bolster up our emotionally soothing approach but then other charts would show its shortcomings. Agreed, for me it maybe as simple as 4-5 addons (if I ever get that far) and look to bank on SR on the Daily, but I will be using the H4 TF and will be looking for shorter trends within the daily TF so I don't anticipate monster 1000 pip moves. But would not argue if I stumbled into one

Looking into the Ichimoku cloud in respects to possible series exit points... Referring to our E/U master template if we would have employed an entrance to the cloud as an series exit as opposed to the Daily DC, we would have garnered an additional $15K. About a 35% increase in profits. Looking at the 2 side by side we see that at times the Daily DC is on the trade side of the Cloud and sometimes the opposite. Both would have traded that trend template very well. Perhaps a "whichever" is tighter" approach would be reasonable. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi guys(I'm sorry for my bad english) i'm looking at this method since the first post and it seems very interesting, but i've one thing that i had not undestand: How we trade if a weekly DC has already been crossed? We simply don't trade and so we do just few trade a month or we have a method of entry?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Simitch, This is addressed in post #1 rule 3 So if the weekly has already been breached just enter like it's an addon trade. That's basically what I've done with all the trades I have opened now. The weeklies were already breached in most cases.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I don't have any experience of the Ichimoku cloud so I can't add anything of value there. The only thought i did have was that before you decide to even tighten up the series stop-loss you need to have a consistent trigger to analysis its effectiveness. Its the old conundrum, we don't know when the trend will bend Maybe a trigger to alert us to harvesting profits could be after so many addons or a weekly/monthly ATR or a when price moves in an extraordinary spike or similar so that the distance from price to the far side of the series/Daily DC stop-loss is n% of your unrealized profits. Others I'm sure will have better ideas than my random brain storming. As for the actual series stop-loss maybe use a 8hr or 12hr DC instead of the Daily DC. This would keep everything uniformed within the DC theme. Well nothing new in my musing but maybe it will stimulate some better ideas. Cheering you on from the stands here spyderman, hope you get a few addons with the trades that are running now so we can sit back in awe of the maths of compounding.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
The one thing I want to keep consistent on is the use of the E/U as a template. That was the intent from the start. Using an 8 or 12 hr DC would have taken us out of the trend about 1/2 way up, so that's out. I wouldn't be looking to "tighten" the s/l as we get deeper if we can arrive on an acceptable series exit from the get go. That's why I mentioned the Ichimoku. It would have kept us in all the way, like the daily DC, but got us out a little earlier at the bottom. As far as the addon trades, yeah, I'd normally have started adding by now, but since the markets have been so crazy they've shot pretty far in 1 direction. So my trails on the H4 DC haven't caught up to BE yet so can't add yet. Even though I've got a couple with over 1,000 pips profit. Here in the next couple of days though we should see some addon opportunities...unless we get some big retracements.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Good point and probably a better robust approach, as it gets the decisions firmed up from the beginning. Especially if you catch a monster trend it would be very easy to start tinkering with flexible exits as the trend progressed with significant unrealized profits.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Finally got E/C and E/A to BE

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi I see that you still have a stop order to go long on USD/JPY on the basis of an addon trade; but it seems as if the weekly DC has been broken and it qualifies as a series initial short entry, am I right or have I got it wrong?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
You're correct howard. If U/J closes below the DC Friday a bearish series can be started.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Ah, is it on closing basis or just break?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Good point. Rules say break of the weekly channel, not close.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
You're correct Howard...U/J, and some of the other Yen crosses, had been setting up for a top end break. I had actually placed that pending order on the 13th. With the hugh move down the last couple of days it broke through the lower Weekly DC, which I missed. I'll be looking to either short on the break of the current daily DC low or go long on the upper Weekly DC break. Nice catch.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yeah, it's the break. We're looking for momentum.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
We had a similar occurrence on the A/C

--- 帖子 #212 ---
yes, thanks for clarification

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Congratulations on your system and your new equity high. I hate to sound negative, but in my testing of trend systems, this kind of large equity gain in such a short time tends to reflect very aggressive position sizing. If I may suggest, consider including a rule to limit the number of simultaneous positions or a method for selecting markets to play in case of correlated signals.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Atokys, Thanks for the suggestions. Normally, I would agree with you. Much of the equity gain were seeing here is due to some extreme movement in response to the worldwide equities volatility we're experiencing. E/A has shot up over 1,000 pips in 4 days. E/C, G/A &amp; E/N 6-800, etc. etc. My lot sizes were kept about as low as possible with a $1K account, in most cases 3 to 4% risk. I will gradually be lowering that risk % as my balance allows. If you read through the thread I think you'll see we do have MM rules in place to reduce the risk while hopefully building larger positions.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Cad/Jpy moved to BE

--- 帖子 #216 ---
hello spyderman, nice thread you got here. your chances of success are huge, seeing that you cut your losses and hold/add to winners. my only concern is the level of the stop orders: they are just a few pips above or below the high/low. we have a lot of fake breakouts and those levels are ideal stop hunting ground. would you consider having a 30-50 pips distance from the highs/lows? wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
E/N, G/A and A/U moved to BE

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yes, I've thought about given a few pips cushion. Not for stophunts perse, but more due to limit orders at previous support resistance. But you're also going to hit a lot of closing stops there to which will help propel. So all in all I don't think it will make that much difference.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
A/J &amp; N/J moved to BE. E/U got closed at a partial loss and my 2nd G/C position was closed for a small loss. I don't like taking a loss on positions that were hundreds of pips in the green but didn't get moved to BE because the H4 trail hadn't caught up yet. We'll have to examine that going forward.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I share your frustration spyderman, though things are still looking very good. I'm still on my quest to somehow not give back large chunks of unrealised profits but not stifle the longer based trend compounding ability. Not an easy one. Let me throw out a very sketchy, unclear jumble of thoughts I'm having so others can pull apart and see if there is anything of worth. You you mentioned those 100's of pips in the green that turned red, what about banking (with some yet to be decided trigger) those 100's of pips so they cease being unrealised but real. Then do the same as we are doing at present keep 50% and grow our capital but use the other 50% for a further addon so you are not robbing the overall trend you are just harvesting a swing and then reinvesting 50% of that swing again in the trend. Maybe this makes no difference to what we are doing already? I just am not that comfortable with the overall idea of "unrealised" profits and allowing perhaps at the end of a successful trend giving back many $1000's. In my mind if from your SL you have $1000's of profits not locked in the term "unrealised profits" is more like "profits at risk". I guess I'm trying to arrive at a comfortable blend (compromise) of banking profits more aggressively especially with larger spikes or runway trends but then adding 50% of this banked profit back in the trend. But......even as I type I am seeing some problems with this. Mmmmh

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Yeah I think that's basically what we're doing. The trick is defining "when" to bank profits or stack trades. It's easy to look back and say "sheesh, I should have banked some profits when that position was up 500 pips". But in real time you have to have some criteria to tell you..."now's the time". I think that's what we've done here. On that E/U trade that stopped out for a loss, it originally had about a 460 pip s/l. It shot up to about a +250 then retraced and stopped out at -184. So not a full loss, but I would have liked to get it to BE. I'll keep going as before but watch and see how we do on this trailing to BE. Meanwhile my original Gbp/Cad position closed out and banked about 580 pips. Starting over on that one

--- 帖子 #222 ---
G/N closed at partial loss

I've placed a limit order for a 2nd position on the Nzd/Jpy. It's using the H4 aggressive. My original position for .02 lots will lock in 260 pips and my new position sell stop will be for .01 lots and a stoploss of 260. So we'll be locking in 260 pips Using the terminology we discussed earlier... Our initial position of 1 "pipunit" will have 260 pips locked with our 2nd position of .5 "pipunits" and a 260 pip s/l Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hello spyderman Any reason for not taking the break of daily DC at 0.7047? 2 steps above the level you entered. Also is the DC on your 4hr chart a 120 period serving as daily?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
awesome! Attached Image (click to enlarge) congrats!!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I am following this thread with great interest. I do not want to diminish the efforts, and it is difficult to disagree with the result: It looks lake a low-risk, low-maintenance and high gain method, which is a goal outlined in the first post. With all this being said, I am sorry, I just do not see an edge here. OK, Donchian channel prevents stupid entries, as the buy and sell "hemispheres" are well defined and distinct. Still, there is little evidence that the long-period Donchian channel breakout implies a long trend. (Obviously vice versa is true.) However, if it is true, it should hold universally. Thus for example an analogous method should work on a short timeframe as well. I doubt that it does though. Something doesn't add up... For example Graviton's method does an entry which is consistent with the fundamental/macro expectation. This is an edge. All these "millipede" methods rely on the long tails of the return distribution - trends. Is the trend such an edge that everything else is irellevant? Such that it is sufficient to trail the stops to breakeven (cut the losses), and, voilà, the rabbit is out of the hat, a consistent beating of the market is achieved? k

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yes, the reason is that at that point price had not moved far enough from our initial entry to lock in profits (using our H4 s/l) to fund a new entry. Had to wait till price (and more importantly the H4 DC trailing stop) got further away. I have a MTF DC indicator. The bluish is H4, the gold is Daily and the aqua is Weekly.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
So far so good. Not really dealing with large numbers yet... I have confidence in the basis of the system. I know the floating is going to move around a lot. I take solace in the fact that with the addon trades I have profit locked in, even if they reverse. I just like to get to BE and then let the market decide. Will any of these positions go on to be a major trend...just no way of knowing, but eventually we'll hit some. You have a good weekend too.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
K...appreciate your thoughts. I believe that the trend is the edge as you put it. I certainly claim no special edge in the entries, stops, etc. etc. I do know that the parameters I've set up with the help of others here, would have traded recent trades (most notably the E/U template) very profitably. I don't feel that's an aberration, I'm confident it will happen again...repeatedly I do think the MM we're employing is an edge of sorts but that same edge could be applied to any trading system. I read a good book by Covel on Trend Following where he compared a simple moving average cross (which I've used often) over the last 25 years or so in a variety of markets. It out performed fund performance by a good margin. The trick is to be consistent and limit risk so that you will be in place when the trend wave comes along. I did well with the Yen collapse trends back in late 2012 early 2013, but I didn't stay in it for the long haul (my MM at the time was not what it should have been). I'm sticking with this till it pans out or I can't afford it any more.

OK, I hope you catch some good trends! Cheers, k

How do you get: Break of the 20 period Donchian Channel on the Weekly chart So if the weekly is going up and hits the 20 period line at the top channel, it is the start of the trend? Meaning it will continue to go up? So according to the picture when it breaks the 20, it should continue up. Just trying to see the correct setup. Thanks mate!!!!

That's the idea, yes. Basically the Donchian channel is just the high or low for the last (n) periods. So the idea is price has just reached a new high for the last 20 weeks. That may well signify long term momentum in that direction... Then again...it may not.

So we've had several positions closed, some at BE some at partial loss. I'm going to concentrate on the addons. You can refer to the TE for others if you want. Following addons closed. Aud/Usd - Nzd/Jpy - Eur/Aud all for a partial loss. None of the original entries we're closed so obviously the opposite daily DC was not hit, so series is still open. I've placed new pending orders on these using the 50% rule (decreasing the amount risked by the amount lost in the addon closure) so we'll see if PA swings back in our favor.

Nzd/Usd both entries closed so we're back to square 1 on that pair. 50% profit banked.

Hi SPyderman, May i ask a few questions? Thanks! 1 Trade management Trail s/l on the H4 DC until BE How to trail? For the first initial entry set, then when to set it to BE?How about the add-on dialy-entry/H4-aggressive-entry? 2 Money management Does it mean there would be always just one position in risk? For initial entry, it would be the .25%~2% range For add-on entry, it would be count as the 50% profit already locked in.?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hey SZ For both...once the entry s/l is set on the H4 Donchian, you trail the stop along that DC channel until your trade is at BE. So it's possible that every 4 hrs ( as the channel updates) you will move your s/l closer to your entry. Once it reaches BE then leave it there until you have to lock in more profit (for an another addon) or the Daily DC/Ichimoku cloud catches up. Now it may be that the H4 DC doesn't move every 4 hr segment depending on Price Action. By "position in risk" we are referring to our actual trade account balance at risk. The only risk to that balance in any series (a series is a string of open positions on a given pair and remains active until all positions are closed by the daily dc/ichimoku cloud trailing stop) is the initial entry. Once that entry is at BE all subsequent entries in that series are funded by locking in 50% of the profits from all still open trades and using the other 50% of locked in profit to open the addons. Hope this helps. If it's still not clear don't hesitate to ask and I can try and throw up some charts.

Valid points kprsa but I think timeframe does matter in relation to the use of simple breakout techniques such as the Donchian. What I have gleaned from trend following or indeed any simpler momentum strategy is that the edge associated with the technique lies in the ability to have a sustained price movement with general market consensus. Given the plethora of different market participants and styles of trading/investing, the only time we get a consistent consensus in price movement inevitably relates to when we have market divergence. These periods inevitably are associated with market 'crisis periods'. Most of the alpha generated in trend trading can be attributed to these discreet moments in time where market behaviour becomes consistent and unidirectional in nature (in periods of fear such as the 2008 GFC or more recently in times of market instability). Most of the success of trend trading therefore is attributed to what is referred to as 'crisis alpha' moments. That is why trend traders benefit from the fat tails of gaussian distributions. Trend traders rely on market divergence as opposed to other trading stayles that rely on market convergence. The risk profile of a market convergent trader is one who takes plenty of small wins but ultimately is crippled by crisis events. Market divergent traders on the other hand like trend traders accept lots of small losses with the umtimate prize of huge wins when volatility becomes extreme. The real purpose behind the Donchian on the higher timeframe is effectively to avoid trading in times of market stability (equilibrium) and only filter those trade opportunities that have the potential to turn into sustainable trends driven by market consensus or fundamental economics. It is not attempting to predict trends that is important. What is important is to keep the powder dry protectng capital while waiting for these unpredictable events to occur.....which has proven time and time again to occur with regular frequency and will inevitably become more and more extreme with persistent central bank intervention. That is why I find the Donchian is an excellent candidate to automate trend trading provided that the Donchian periods chosen is large enough to prevent overtrading which is an ultimate killer for trend trading.

Thanks Spyderman! " So it's possible that every 4 hrs ( as the channel updates) you will move your s/l closer to your entry " Let me try to understand it this way Suppose an entry is of short entry, with initial entry at 100.0 Initial SL at 150.0 After 4 hrs, DC-4-HR moved to 130, adjust SL to 130.0 The following 4HR, 130.0 got catched up, the initial entry stopped out with (130.0-100.0) loss. Right? Thanks!

Hi Spyderman, Disturbing again, i have another questions Considering the money managemnt, assume three entries would be considered, (No.1, No.2, No.3) 1) THe time No.2 opened, now - No.1 trade would be with 200 bucks in profit, then we locked in 100 bucks - No.2 trade would be at risk of 100 bucks (Same as No 1's locked in) 2) The time No.3 kicked in, we would have - Given No.2 trade would be with 100 bucks in profit - Given No.1 trade would be with 300 bucks in profit We would set No.2 and No.1 locked in - No.1 locked in 150 bucks - No.2 locked in 50 bucks And we would have 200 bucks as No.3' risk, Please correct me if i am wrong, thanks!

Hey Copernicus, Thanks for your thoughtful answer. I understand what you say. And I do agree: It is reasonable that the larger scale events would be less prone to, say, false breakouts (stop hunts etc.), and that they should reflect better the economic divergences that ultimately drive the Forex market. Due to this, the simple trend following strategies might have an implicit edge. Additionally, the problem with lower timeframes is the (spread+transaction cost/movement) ratio, which I would expect to be negligible at higher timeframes, but not necessarily so at, say 5-15 min TF. My current line of thought is to try to approach the market in a fractal manner. Sustained movements - trends occur at all timeframes, and I am trying to devise a system to follow trends at every timeframe -&gt; basically caching momentum, and being direction-independent as much as possible. The Donchian by itself is not fit for this purpose, but I do have a couple of tricks of my own that could provide an edge at lower TFs. Cheers, k

Nice kprsa. I like the sound of your multi-timeframe approach in that it gives no room to hide for any price movement that ultimately manifests as a trend of consequence. I do a similar thing which I refer to as 'ring-fencing' price action on mutiple timeframes. It is akin to setting a trap and waiting for extreme events where I can catch those fleeing......and eat them.

Hi Spyderman I have been following your thread with a lot of interest and really appreciate what you doing here. I do have some queries that I hope you will be able to clarify for me. I have set up my profiles on MT4 and have been going through your list of pending and open trades to make sure my understanding of the process is correct. 1. There are two pending orders for EURGBP. One long at .7484 and the other short at .6936. Both are set to the Wkly DC. I can understand the long setup but why is the short not set for an aggressive entry on the H4 DC as the weekly DC is still indicating that the trend is downwards? 2. Also to do with the EURGBP setup. The weekly DC is clearly indicating the trend is downward but the daily DC is ranging, possibly with a bias to the short side. In this case what are your rules for defining the trend direction and which type of DC entry to use? 3. If the series is taken out but the price continues trending in the same direction as the series that was taken out, do you wait for a new weekly DC entry or are either the H4 DC aggressive setup or the daily DC setup acceptable? A current example of this is the GBPCAD where you have a long pending order on the weekly DC, but could a long pending order be set on the H4 DC? 4. What is the reason for setting the NZDCAD short pending order at .8020? On my chart it does not seem to relate to any DC levels. 5. On your trade explorer there is a Non-Cume Return chart that shows 35 trades. Are these individual trades or are they the series trades? If they are individual trades is there another way to see how the series trades are performing? And Spyderman's reply follows: 1. You are correct, the trend is still down on the weekly. The daily was violated to the upside on August 24th so that invalidates the H4 aggressive. H4 aggressive is only used when in a current series, or trying to enter a series that is in progress. Any violation of the daily DC ends a series and requires a new start, at the daily DC if same direction as previous, or at the weekly DC if the opposite direction. That being said, my short entry is wrong. At the time I set it the bottom daily and weekly DC were at the same point. I've been moving my stop but overlooked moving the entry. Thanks for the spot, I'll correct it. 2. I think that's answered now in 1. 3. Again the daily DC was violated on the 31st, thus "ending" the series. So we'll need to wait for a break of the daily DC (which at the time is even with the weekly) before entering long. The idea here is that the trend has lost momentum and we want a clear sign before entering again. 4. My daily DC is at .8020. Big news spike that day. Imagine there would be some variance broker to broker due to spreads widening. 5. No idea how that part of the TE works. My master shows the same thing, no detail.

Hi Spyderman, very impressed by your discipline, just waiting for a nice long trend with a few addons and all those small loses will be wiped away and more. Getting through the chop until the payday trend comes takes the patience you are showing. Well done!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Definitely takes patience. Markets have stayed pretty choppy this past month. Hopefully we'll see things moving directionally in the coming months

--- 帖子 #275 ---
So I'm in to REPS about 7 weeks now. Might be a good time to look and some of the good and bad so far. The markets have been pretty flat over all...not atypical for this time of year. Even so, my starting equity is down only about 10%. That's pretty good. My balance however is down about 23%, so not as good. Couple of negative are leading to the drawdown that I'd like to address at some point without changing the strategy too much. Firstly with these choppy markets I'm getting a lot of entries that go positive a couple hundred pips and then turn around and stop out for a loss. The market just isn't moving far enough for long enough to get to BE with the trailing H4 method. Secondly, using the aggressive H4 entry in the choppy markets is leading to a lot of whipsaw stop outs. Both of these problems will lessen as/when markets start trending, so we'll see if they take care of themselves. I may look seriously at changing the BE if trades get up by a couple hundred pips. On the good side I do like the way the addon trades are playing out. For example on the N/J, even though the addons haven't taken off, they have received enough movement so that when they have come back and stopped out, it was for a partial loss so I have been able to keep the series going while accommodating the partial loss. We'll press forward and see where the autumn markets take us.

Hi Spyderman, Why not cut some of the currency pairs and add some commodities to further diversify your portfolio? Regarding pyramiding; one should think of it as building up to an optimal position size. If you feel that undertaking your max pyramid size from trade inception is too risky perhaps you should reduce the size or remove the pyramiding component altogether.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Atokys Thanks for your thoughts. I'm fine with the pyramiding aspect. Everything added on is risk free at that point (in relation to my account balance) so no sweat there. I may add commodities and indices at some point but don't really have much selection on my MT4 broker

--- 帖子 #279 ---
The point im trying to make is that it is not risk free even though it seems to be. On the surface it looks that way but on the portfolio level you are undertaking more potential volatility. Personally, the test that I would use would be to assume entering the initial trade at the max pyramid size. If this size is too risky for you then you should not consider pyramiding to this size. Of course, this is just a respectful suggestion. If you understand the implications and you are OK then more power to you.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Atokys Would appreciate if you could explain in more detail: "The point im trying to make is that it is not risk free even though it seems to be. On the surface it looks that way but on the portfolio level you are undertaking more potential volatility.""

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Atokys, Perhaps you can use the trading template example in post #46 to explain what you are saying. The last entry in that pyramid is for 6.23 standard lots. In the example, I started with a $10k account. With a modest s/l of 200 pips that would represent a $12K risk to my balance. I obviously would not be able to open a position of that size under those circumstances. However, in the context of pyramiding that series there was no danger to my account balance, only floating profit to that point.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Aud/Jpy series closed out.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Assuming that you are trailing your stops to secure profit and pouring that profit back into the trade; you are increasing your potential profit while maintaining a constant risk amount at the expense of your position in a trade. If the trade goes against you at any point during the pyramid you are losing more than you would have loss if you had not pyramided. In the context of one trade in a vacuum, it looks harmless. But in the context of a portfolio you are really doing the opposite of diversification by increasing your correlated risk. In this scenario, you stand to win big from extreme trends but the cost is more equity volatility in the absence of such outliers.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Couldn't agree more with that. However diversification isn't my goal here...catching the extreme trends is. I understand that many of my entries are extremely correlated, but, as the saying goes, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. I can't risk not being in on the series that hits the big trend. For example last year on our E/U template there were no doubt many Eur and Usd crosses that were correlated with the Eur/Usd, but it was the E/U that hit the tradeable trend while others may have fallen short (I didn't study all crosses during that time period though)

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi Spyderman I notice that UJ has just opened on your TE. It looks as if the entry was on a H4 DC cross. I thought that for the first position in a new series price needed to cross the W DC?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
No you can use the aggressive H4 to jump on board as long as the daily hasn't been violated in the opposite direction. That series has been rolling along and we're just looking for a spot to get in. Now if the daily DC would have been violated then that would "end" the series and you would need to wait for a daily dc break in the same direction to start a new series or a weekly dc break in the opposite direction to start a new series.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Just as a reminder, I'm also using the ichimoku cloud as a series close in concert with the daily DC. So same would apply to it.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thanks Spyderman Could you list the positions you have entered and exited for this UJ series, including the entry/exit prices and dates? It it's to much trouble that is OK.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Great piece of logic in action there A.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I would seriously look at diversification spyderman. What is hampering your results currently is not your pyramiding but your entries. It is a symptomatic problem associated with trading a single instrument. To avoid the chop you need to actually reduce trade frequency on a single instrument by a selection of conditions that prevents the ability to overtrade and try to only act on trades that scream out at you. It is best to therefore be late in trend entry than early and ensure that you only trade trends of substance. What I mean here is that you need to place your trade entries in zones that reflect the 'fat tails of gaussian distributions' as that is where the intense trends of duration lie. They are infrequent but you overcome this by broad diversification. If you attempt to trend trade within the zones of normal distribution you will die. This is where diversification comes in as trade frequency can be restored by widening your investment universe. The principle is based on a feature of markets in that trends of substance are an anomaly and irregular in nature that can never be predicted but when crisis events occur, market behaviour becomes directional in nature due to market divergence. For example in the equity market the entire asset class turns red as does forex to a lesser extent when the USD is hit which in turn creates market divergence in the majority of this asset class. This is where you can with confidence trade a trend as opposed to the illusion of a trend. The best trends to trade are few and far between but by spreading the joy to other instruments and in particular non-correlated liquid instruments, then you improve the probability of regularity of occurrence of trends of significance. What Atokys says then would apply in that the need for extensive pyramiding actually enhances risk via correlation so you could then decrease the extent of pyramiding and preserve more 'locked in profit per trade'. Personally I don't pyramid with diversification as it compromises my equity curve by exacerbating drawdowns. I put all the 'punching power' into a single entry on a single instument when it screams at me and then I just let it go with a trailing stop positioned at the boundaries of volatility. Your pyramiding technique however for a single instrument is particularly powerful when a trend of significance is underway.....however it might not be quite enough for positive expectancy. Only time will tell i s'ppose. :-)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Yeah you can just go to the trade explorer to the closed trades and sort on the instrument field. That will put them all in order.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Well it looks like the markets may well be flipping over on trend changes. A lot of pairs are stuck in the cloud. Guess I'll sit on my hands for a while.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi Spyderman, Good to see your still sticking to plan, this is a good example for me and the more I read its the only way. Hoping you will catch a big one shortly. Just one thought for you to ponder I remember you saying a while ago about being up 100's of pips only to see it all come back on you and stop you out for a loss. Since risk is a major issue whilst balancing this with catching that big trend have you thought about splitting your position in to two entries and once you have gone 1R you bank this and you then have then a risk free (apart from gaps or major slippage) even if you don't move your stop to break even at that time. I realize the compromise is that your position size is then halved if price goes in your favour but I like the idea that the risk is taken care of and of course you still addon to the position. I think I saw this on a thread by Peter Crown years ago?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
SP, Thanks for the idea. That's definitely worth thinking about. I'll kind of watch some current entries and see what develops. Typically if price moves far enough (say 2-300 pips) to close 1/2 and cover the other then price would have moved to BE at that point. But it would be nice to book some profit in case in retraces.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
spyderman, I look at your description in the first post of this thread: low risk, high return. This system was up a lot at the start because of the China scare. How much was it.......30-40%? Now its down with a DD of over 30%: a difference of 60-70%. I think the idea should be to cut the losses fast and let the profits run. The stellar runs are not there very often. The weekly focus might be too long-term: perhaps scale in faster and get out earlier on daily TF. it doesn`t matter if after a retrace you will be sometimes without positions: as soon as the trend continues, you`ll be back in. Do you think that this system is nimble enough in adverse conditions?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Yes the emphasis is on low risk/high return As far as risk goes, as I stated on the E/U template we were using a 1% risk to achieve a 420% return. However, as I mentioned in post #55, I would like to be below that 1% on my initial risk, more down toward 1/4%. As I also mentioned in that post, I started this with a relatively small account which will not allow for that small of % risk for the size of s/l we're using. Looking at the TE we've had about 70 trades with 33 of them losing over 1%...some above 3%. So that drastically inflates the risk factor. With that in mind, I'm totally happy with the amount invested thus far, especially considering the flatness of the markets Aug-Oct. The lot sizes I'm having to use would be more in line with a $3K account. From that standpoint we're at a 10%DD. As far as any "initial" success or the system being up at the beginning, I would say that it has had no "success" as of yet, at least not in relation to "high returns". We haven't even got to a 3rd addon position on any pairs, again due to the nature of the markets of late. I "wish" that wasn't the case, but I can't say I'm surprised. The very nature of what we're trying to capture insures it is not going to transpire often. As said before...I just want to be there when it does.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Well it's been over 3 weeks since my last post here. Not because I haven't wanted to, but because the markets haven't warranted it... I've been placing orders, as you may have observed, but market movement hasn't allowed for so much as 1 addon entry in that period. So we have to keep waiting. The interim has given rise to the opportunity for me to study more charts and improve on the system. Two areas I'd like to improve on are: 1. Capturing more longer term trend series 2. Reducing entries getting stopped out in ranging markets. As mentioned I've studied many more charts including commodities and indices and have come up with some refinements. 1. Dropping the ichimoku cloud . It doesn't seem to add much to the back end and gets a bit messy up front (beginning of series) 2. Dropping the weekly series start signal . Won't need it with the change on the daily DC. 3. Changing the series signal start and the series end to a 55 period on the daily DC. This greatly expands the number of potentially profitable series that are available to us. Notice the attached Gbp/Jpy chart which offers a 4,450 series using the 55 DC. At the same time it doesn't kill us on the retracement of our Eur/Usd series that I've been using as a template. Notice again on the attached chart that the switch only changed the E/U series from 2,450 pips to 2,250 pips. A good tradeoff I think. 4. Changing the s/l and trail to a 35 period on the H4 DC. Again this should help curtail some of the whipsaw action that's taking us out of trades. 5. Not using the aggressive H4 entry after a previous H4 entry gets stopped out. If we get an H4 stop out, whether at a loss or BE, we will wait for a new 55 period daily DC entry to resume the series. This would apply whether or not we have any remaining entries open that are trailing at the 55 daily DC. 6. Moving the entries trailing at the 35 H4 DC to trailing at the 55 daily DC as soon as practicable. This really isn't a change as I've mentioned this before, but I am refining how I'm planning to go about it. Difficult to explain without live examples so we will be exploring this as the opportunities unfold. Well, that's about it for now. We'll see where this takes us.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Spyderman Thanks for the update. I am sure these changes will improve the system and look forward to seeing how they work going forward. Also look forward to seeing how you will be changing from the H4 DC to the D DC trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thanks K... Let's hope the markets cooperate and start moving so we can test some of this out.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Okay, So we have a bit of market movement going on and I have several positions running at BE or better. A few are getting into position to put some addon trades forward. In reviewing the thread it seems that I've deviated a bit in what I set out to do in respects to s/l trailing. I mentioned at the get go that I'd move my stop to BE at an "appropriate" time, but after getting taken out at BE a couple of times I started trailing. I just can't see the wisdom of allowing a trade to go over 100 pips in profit and not move to BE. So I'm reverting to a discretionary move to BE for the time being. I'm going to stick with the 20 H4 DC to set my initial stop and trail with that until such time I feel I should move to BE. So on with the addon. Usd/Cad The Cad dollar has definitely been showing weakness and with the dollar strength, we've had a nice move on this pair. I'm sitting at 456 pips profit on my initial .01 lots. I'm placing a new pending buy stop at 1.4010 with the stop at 1.3850 for 160 pips. I will lock in 387 pips profit which will allow me to place another .01 lot entry using 50% or less of that locked profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just letting you know that someone is reading your thread with interest.

Consider running a backtest to save on time.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Welcome jmn. Hopefully things will liven up as the markets move in the New Year.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Yes, I have backtested and that was basically the starting premise. It will/should perform nicely going forward but obviously requires a trending environment.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
An extensive backtest should provide some indication of how the system fares in all environments. If it suffers too steep a drawdown when the market is ranging then this should be a cause for concern.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
wow, around 70% drawdown...... appreciate your efforts spyderman. but think you`re too focused on getting the right system for when the times are favourable. but what about the times when there`s no trend? is a drawdown of 70% not crazy? agree with atokys: in my opinion extensive backtests should have been done over the last 10 years to find a balance to minimize risk in ranging periods and to maximize profits in trending periods. my preference is to enter a trade after a pull back and a continuation of the trend, not a breakout. as we all know, price often comes back to the breakout area and even further. if another pull back comes along further in the trend, add another trade when the trend resumes. keep stacking until the trend runs out. wishing everybody a merry Christmas and a very happy new year.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
2nd position on U/Cad has been moved to BE with about 100 pips floating profit. I'm leaving the s/l on the 1st entry where it was at about +350 pips. Should we finally get a 3rd entry opportunity we will move the 2nd entry stop up even with the 3rd entry initial s/l. We will also move the 1st entry stop to the 2nd entry position. At that point we won't be moving the 1st entry stop until the daily channel catches it. You can see it following on the chart. Might sound a bit confusing but we'll hopefully get to see in live if price keeps moving. Right now we're ahead of the bottom of the h4 channel as we moved to BE early, so we have to wait for that to catch up and pass us before placing a 3rd entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Well, it's hard to say as I can't tell your time frame, pair traded or settings on your indicator. Having said that, our entry is on the Daily channel and our trailing stop is on the H4, at least for each position. Now for the series than our exit for the entire run would be on the same TF but in your example you would have been taken out on your H4 trail long before that point. Give me some more details if you'd like.

That is daily timeframe AUD/CAD. What was your greatest losses in pips using this method? thanks.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Can you give me a date range so I can compare it to my charts? Thanks

9.3.2011 - 18.4.2011

Well, I can't quite get my data to line up with yours but that's probably differences in daily candles and immaterial. Here's my Daily and H4. If you took that short side entry on the break of the daily your stop would have been at the H4 channel, so your exit would be as noted, not up at the top of the daily channel. Hope that helps.

So, for exit I do not use 1D TF/55 or 4H TF/20 for minimaze of loss?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
The exit s/l for an individual trade position is the 4H 20 channel until it hits BE. Then we don't move it until we need to lock in profits for another addon entry later. Eventually the daily 55 channel will catch up (if the series progresses long enough) and then all entries will be trailed at the daily 55 until the final series is closed at that level.

Hello, yesterday you open EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD, me too. Can you type how is your SL for tihis pairs ? (some about 1.48695 for AUR/AUD and 1.60100 for EUR/NZD?) thanks.

Stops are always changing as we trail them along the H4 channel. You can see the stops in the trade explorer.

I am sorry, but i do not understand, see image, thanks..

Looks like you might have accidentally put in 120 on your channel instead of 20

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I do not thing so.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi piko, it seems to me that your indicator settings are off. Try to lower 'tf' value to 240 and see how it's working then.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Ok, thanks, I only switch TF in Metatrader and I do not change TF in indicator. thanks..

Hello Spyderman. You still use same setting for trading or you have some improvements? I still watching your trading. thanks

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Still using the same settings at this point.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Very interesting strategy. I a big fan of HTF's and letting the trades run longer. Forgive me if this has been answered before. The Donchian settings are weekly for W1 and daily for both D1 and 4H?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
We're no longer using the weekly. Settings for the daily DC are 55 and settings for the 4H DC are 20

HELLO I am Patrick j Templar and it nice to meet you First of all the first thing I'd like to say to you is WHAT A GREAT THREAD I have read a lot of trading books but none of them had as many ups and downs that has this 17 page thread has had, You have gone a bit quiet because obviously now it's 2017 and your last post was 2016 February so I hope you're doing ok and you haven't gone Zero Dark Thirty on all of us. Um I know it's a bit of time has passed but I'm going to probably make a YouTube video and hope to be able to link it here because it'll be easier to go through all my ideas while watching a video of me pointing out what I'm talking about um hopefully you're still around and you might enjoy it and some somebody ideas or not but it doesn't really matter but um there are many times I wanted to join but I kept out so to be honest I think you've done a great thing here and there any newbies to come along and read what you've gone through and see what you've done it's it's really good for them on their path of trading
