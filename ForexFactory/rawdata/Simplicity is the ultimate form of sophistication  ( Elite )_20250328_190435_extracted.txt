Enjoy

hey waterflame.... have you given any thought to possibly keeping the 3/34 ma cross but use the cci in a different manner..... such as rather than have the ma cross and cci cross on the same bar, let the long trade be when the 3 ma crosses above the 34 ma and cci is above 0..... and for the short trade, when the 3 ma crosses below the 34 ma and cci is below the 0..... i'm fairly confident this will improve your results..... backtesting a ea with the various conditions should let ya know for sure..... also instead of using the charts 15 minute timeframe for the cci, using the daily timeframe cci with a period of 4 should help..... the higher timeframe might give a better sense of trend...... again backtesting via an ea will let ya know.... in any event, thanks for posting your system.....h

Hi, looks interesting, but it seems that one need a bit of practise (like any other strategy) in order to be profitable. BTW, have you tried lower timeframes (like 5min)? Because watching a trade for sometimes 20+ hours is too much.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
hi waterflame can you tell us when you trade this system and on which pairs you use it ?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
thank you , keep heading

--- 帖子 #8 ---
you are welcome, and about the timeframe, every job can be boring if you don't enjoy it, i also will make you aware of the 5 min chart risk, that causes very near price action, and definitely sharp volatile signals, most trades can be stopped out with your spread, this is why i suggest only to trade 15min and higher timeframes

--- 帖子 #9 ---
i only use 4 pairs eur/usd is very smooth in trading, have low spread, but less profit eur/chf consolidate too much, but have nice break outs and good profit usd/jpy has low spread, most time volatile, and very nice profit gbp/jpy is maybe a bit dangerous with the spread, but very active and gives best profit

this file doesn´t work to me with mt4? any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
when you have added the file to expert/indicators file, restart MT4, than it must appear

--- 帖子 #12 ---
i am quite new to the hole materia with mt4 so sry for my newbie questions, it seems thats its working now the icon under the left site turned black what does this script actually do, will it notify found signals or..

--- 帖子 #13 ---
honestly, i dont understand your qustion " the icon under the left site turned black " - make an image and write your question + description ps: ask whatever you need to know

--- 帖子 #14 ---
yeah i talking sh#t, it´s comming late down here and i should go to bed. what i mean is, i put this script to my mt4 folder under experts/indicators after restarting mt4 i have a new icon to experts script folder to the left side of mt4, and so what to do now..

--- 帖子 #15 ---
oh no, its not an Expert Advisor, its simply the CCI indicator with 34 variable preference, dont put the file in expert, but in C:\Program Files\MetaTrade\experts\indicators you have to use the system manualy, i haven't the EA for this system, i don't know writing MQL sorry

--- 帖子 #16 ---
i could write but first would like to test, i am new to trading systems and mt4 for testing them but i do have a years of background in software development in nearly every language, i am sure it´s not difficult put this system into code, you can put everything into code if you good

--- 帖子 #17 ---
that would be amazing and very altruist if you do this for us, many many thanks friend

--- 帖子 #18 ---
yeah will see what i can do, no problem. keep on posting your results with that system i will further check it out tomorrow, have to sleep, n8 everybody!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
n8, tomorrow

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanks for sharing your system WaterFlame. I'm testing on a 5 min chart with some different settings. I do like your 15 min setup as well

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Do you have this as a Simple Moving Average or a Smoothed Moving Average?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
you are welcome man, but beware of the 5 min chart

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Can't argue with this setup to much

--- 帖子 #24 ---
ManTorp, its a Simple Moving average, thank you for the advise, i wil write it in the first post by the Setup

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Water: how do you filter the weak signals or do you take them all if the criteria is met?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I suggest to erase the Ergodic Sniper, and try out the system how its described, read the rules ad keep it simple

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I really use the Ergo for an alert system as much anything- a heads up. I need to be alerted when A signal presents itself. I wish we could program the CCI to alert differently. I must say that the 15 chart as you have presented will do the trick. How many signals to you get weekly from your 4 pairs?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
a current little pipscalp, i was into it about 3 pips too late, my fault, discipline is all, but im still in profit This trade will be an advanced trade like described in the rules, with a 100% exit, price reversal exit, or zero line CCI Stop loss ( For Advise to never get into a trade late and without current confirming price action entry ) http://www.abload.de/img/pipscalp0c9.gif

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Ok thanks btw i use the standard cci indicator with 34 setting is that ok ?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Beautiful entry the GBP

--- 帖子 #31 ---
yes, carrera, woodie is just fine with the colors to see again the trend direction, you can use the normal CCI too if you feelconfortable with it

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Anyway- Nice Work WaterFlame. I've very excited to start trading your system. I'll report later with some real results. Bless you for sharing Cheers~

--- 帖子 #33 ---
yes , very beauty

--- 帖子 #34 ---
you are welcome FxStar, my pleasure, and good trading

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Plug this into charts- you might like it

--- 帖子 #36 ---
i have traded almost all systems here in FF or other Forums, maybe hundreds of indicators, i will not complicate anything with additional indicators, they will tell anyway the same thing, but CCI is clear proper in entry and exit signals, and the 34 variable Fibonacci number is far enough to have good profit ( at least 10 pips ) with low false sloppy entries , and near enough to have a good stop loss condition

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Good point~I do appreciate simplicity!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Well Star, thank you for the conversation

--- 帖子 #39 ---
thanks for the simple system. just one question regarding entry and exit: ma crossover and cci cross to zero line should be at the same time? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Star, the only advice i will give you, and i have learned with time, is to identify the psychological mood of a market there are 3 criterias - Healthy ( good trading ) - Sick ( too volatile and extreme aggresive with spikes ) ranging - Lazy ( slow ) when you learn to see this on your chart, than you can pick out the good markets, even if they become from health to sick or to lazy, you can trade 2 trades with a stop loss, than change your pair and reasearch again about a health market. Healthy market http://www.abload.de/img/healthyd7u.gif Sick market http://www.abload.de/img/badexampleicm.gif Lazy market http://www.abload.de/img/lazy4ji.gif

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes, and you can be assured, because none of the indicaotrs will cross individualy, because the CCI 34 zero line cross and the 3 Ema - 34 Sma are perfectly assembled together.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
thanks matey already in profit on usd/jpy and gbp/jpy both on 15min tf. excellent stuff.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
After a good entry and a healthy market run, its now about me to choose my exit conditions... - do i exit now with a 20 pip scalp profit - will i wait until CCI returns to 100% line for sharp advanced trading exit - or will i risk a CCI zero line cross with 3 Ema - 34 Sma cross Learn to identify Price action behaviour, if candles are fast rising or falling, continuation or reversal, etc, everything depends on it http://www.abload.de/img/cuurenttradeexitd6n.gif

--- 帖子 #44 ---
welcome bro

i will do it next time, thank you Mina

exit method and condition to save profit and wait for new entry ( 9 pips profit ) Eur/Usd is very low profit giving at asian time http://www.abload.de/img/exitb3m.gif

--- 帖子 #49 ---
never trade anything, if the CCI 34 is not crossing the zero line with 3 Ema - 34 Sma crossing at the same time http://www.abload.de/img/noentrytdt.gif

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Nice system, WaterFlame. I added an alert to your template to make life a little easier. The email function is set to "off", alert function "on" in the template. If you want it to email when there's a cross of the 3 and the 34 just set it the way you want it. Happy trading. (for people who trade on Fridays) ken

--- 帖子 #51 ---
thank you ken for the alert Ma, its the best alert Ma i have ever tried out, but i suggest to monitor yourself the charts, and not awaiting the signal, because this system need an eye on price action, and not a too late entry alert for a signal what is too far away from initial entry conditions. Read in the first post in this thread the System Rules, the " Attention: " , what describes entry while Candle forming, until Candle forming and finaly signals giving 3 Ema crossing 34 Sma, with CCI 34 zero line crossing ( price action ), your entry Condition im glad you are on board ^^

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Never trade a too big candle, most of them can be fakes, and result in reversal stop losses with a too late entry, ( loosig more as jsut your spread stop loss from entry " see the rules " ) Remember, only fine normal candles with your entry rules Read also the Market Condition and psychological mood describing, this kind of big candles can maybe explain a Sick market condition and continuation in this mood... Its better not to trade and not to loose your money, even if market will go your way, we must trade quality, not quantity http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=40 http://www.abload.de/img/neveruei.gif

--- 帖子 #53 ---
here is an excellent psychological mooding market, becoming healthy, and not risking a lot of stop loss with a big candle http://www.abload.de/img/ever4oh.gif

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I dont have enough words to thank you for this system and how grateful I am that you were kind enough to share a stratedgy as powerful and profitable as this. At a time when im just about starting live trading, This is what I will use mostly to trade now. Thanks, I dont think i have enough words to say to show you how grateful i am for this. Hey kenmania: Thanks so much for the cool alerts for this system bro. Appreciate it a ton. Thank you both so much. God bless

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Waterflame,i love this type of method, thank you. also, your little tidbits about trading are very good also (sick market,big candles etc.).i hope you continue. ps, could i get a copy of your onscreen clock and info indicator? it is on your template, but dosen't work without indicator in mt4. thanks again..............vince

--- 帖子 #56 ---
im glad you enjoy it Fire, you are welcome, ask any time everything, i will reply as fast i can...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
i thank you for your notice Vince, i will add for you the indicators in the 3rd post where you can find the template and indicators...

--- 帖子 #58 ---
sorry but the edit button disappeared at the template post, i will add the indicators here

--- 帖子 #59 ---
By the way, does anybody have any idea on what type of stop loss would be good on this system or where on the charts I could look to find a good stop loss? Thanks guys

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Stop Loss is described in the Rules section #1 post

--- 帖子 #61 ---
You're welcome. (you too, Wilteredfire). God bless you back. Thanks for point that out to me Waterflame. I'll be giving this system a closer look in study over the weekend. It seems like a real winner for entry.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
got it,thanks

--- 帖子 #63 ---
this will be another little help for exits, a tool for the big trades in higher timeframes (1h sample) after a nice strong entry and a Trending market begining, you can add for your exit descision the Fibonnaci retracement tool. Use only the 23 % for it to not give away much of your current profits Example: Draw the fib low to high of current position http://www.abload.de/img/1qjukv.gif after this , when price didn't return and do not breach the 23% fib level, but continue the Trending, wait for a new consolidation and redraw the Fib level again http://www.abload.de/img/2v7lmv.gif same thing for here another time http://www.abload.de/img/3y71wc.gif this time price returns and and exit while crossing the 23% Fib ( time to wait for a new Trade http://www.abload.de/img/4xtloi.gif

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thank you so much for opening my eyes to the simplicity of your system. After blowing out a few accounts thinking I had found my "holy grail", last night I stumbled upon a set of 6 indicators that I felt gave me the signals I needed, a fool proof system as long as 5 of 6 indicator agreed (how foolish of me). I compared my system to yours this morning and realized your very simple cross with CCI gave the exact same signals. So again thank you, and many pips to you.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
im happy for you mitch, if you have questions , just ask , you are welcome

--- 帖子 #66 ---
1 - Read News a day before ( if you are not a news trader, dont trade news events time) 2 - Choose your trading session time for every pair you will trade 3 - Observe Market Conditions ( see "Psychological Mood" ) Choose the Healthiest onces 4 - Wait for entry signals and follow the rules

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks for this great system! I have a question. In your first post you say this: notice : every signal will be confirmed after the next CANDLE, behave on the Current CANDLE while the signal is appearing, and analyze it well, it will be your loosing or wining CANDLE ( with this system you will be a winner before the market behave on you ) research about it well. I don't understand what you mean by this. Are you saying that once we get the signal, do not enter until a new candle forms after that? But you also say that the first candle will be our losing or winning candle, so I'm confused...Thanks again for this system!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Enjoy I meant by this, that you have to enter in this conditions you are asking about, because if you dont, the next candle will be a late entry, and not good for Stop loss exit IF reversal, and that why i have said, it depends on it to become your winning or losing candle "its all about candle price action entry , with 3 Ema crossing 34 Sma with CCI crossing zero line entry"

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I see, so enter immediately when the signal comes, and possibly exit after the next candle comes if it's not looking good. Thanks! One more question, I see the default setting of the woodies CCI you posted are very different from the one in your pictured that you use. Actually, not only do the settings look different, but even the indicator itself looks different. Are you personally using the regular CCI indicator, or the Woodies? And what settings should we use, as I see yours is different from the default. Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
The CCI what is for download here i the thread available, have to modified by the preferences, if not allready the template saved them Modify: TrendCCI_Period : 34 Disable visibility of Entry CCI by the colors to none Disable Show LSMA to false

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks a million! I look forward to testing this out! I'll also see how it performs on other pairs besides the 4 you mentioned.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
if i will go entry on a signal, when do i know where to exit, always if the cci returns zero ? where to book profits...

--- 帖子 #73 ---
you are welcome 24HourTrader, yes , if you find other good trending pairs to trade, please let us know, thank you

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Visual Exit Explain 3 conditions 1 - CCI weakening 2 - CCI 100% or 200% reverse 3 - Ema cross 34 Sma http://www.abload.de/img/exitj28.gif

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Waterflame, Thank you very much for your strategy and explaining all the details. I have one question, do you wait for the signal to be confirmed with the closing of the candle before entering? Thanks once again.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Waterflame, Can you explain the significants of the yellow and grey bars that show up in the CCI. I think I understand blue (up-trend - various strength) and yellow (down-trend - various strength). Thanks Mtich

--- 帖子 #77 ---
It depends on market condition and the candle there different aproaches - If you are an agressive trader and you will trade the Full begining big candle if market is extremely volatile, its your choice (i have wrote in the rules that i disencourage this kind of trading, because it can result in sick markets and maybe hard reversal with loosing stop loss) - another is while confirming a nice slow entry candle formed in the time within signals becoming affirmative, and enter in this time the trade ( 2 or 3 minutes before candle is closing, and begining with it the new candle ) ( the time of the candle entry depends on the candles behaviour itself) . - the last one is entering the trade after the candle is closed and begi a new candle with all signals confirming full entries personally i prefer the 2 last once, but sometimes i scalp too the first

--- 帖子 #78 ---
grey means new begining trend yellow bar is confirming new trend red is downtrend blue is uptrend

--- 帖子 #79 ---
i m now away over the week end, keep posting your questions, i will answer as soon as i come back, have a nice week end all

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi Waterflame, Thanks for your reply. I agree the last two entry methods are more conservative and,therefore, safer. How many pips do you target when using the first aggressive scalp entry? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
could you comment to me this shot, i hope you can see my entry, i still don´t understand where i should place a stop and book profit., i mean where to see when it´s going down again http://www.chixpoint.com/images/mt4.jpg http://www.chixpoint.com/img/mt4.jpg

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hi liOuid, very nice spotting ( you were too late in, with a big candle, and this is a 5 min chart ) i will not take responsabelity if you dont do what is described, but anyway. To return to your question, i will tell you something, after you feel having some nice profits, even with the Exit rules i gave you, its your choice to choose one of them. This system is based on the thing that, ( Entry is the first condition to begin a trade, protecting yourself from losses and your few maybe big profits, and the exit can be choosen, the important thing is that you are in profit. If the trade begin and do not CCI weak, and already have profit, wait for 100% break and 100% reversal exit, when not, continue and so on also for the 200% break and 200% exit reversal... After that, its about you again to choose, if you wish to exit now, or you will wait for the 3 Ema - 34 Sma cross, for getting max profit, or risking again most of your profits to get just a few, because from this point, the only thing what can make you nervous is to see the 34 Sma swinging with price, and all your profits can return again ( or it gives you more than you estimated ). Never be greedy, when you feel good with your profits, and seeing market conditions are not encouraging you to continue, get your profit and exit, wait for the next trade etc. Its a step by step work, not a one trade being a billionair holly grail watching charts click drinking Champagne thing. Get your profits at the first best condition! that is what i do, even with the big trades, if someone is also patient, and have enough money to wait for a 3 Ema 34 Sma reversal and perhaps loosing his profits again ( just the profits of his trade, not of his balance ) and wasting time, cheers. http://www.abload.de/img/exitforiliqpve.gif

--- 帖子 #83 ---
If the position has a weak progression, i try to cover my spread and maybe 2 to 10 pips If the position has average progression, 10 to 30 pips If the position is healthy, profit can be from 50 to 100 or more pips it depends on the pair you trade usd/jpy or gbp/jpy are one of the best This all just in the 15 min chart, higher timeframes can result in hundreds and hundreds

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Can I make a suggestion for posting charts? I have a 17 inch computer monitor (I'll upgrade when I'm filthy rich) and it's hard to read the thread when you have to scroll left to right line by line. You can easily attach images from your computer by clicking the "Manage Attachments" button under the dialog box. A menu will pop up where you can browse your hard drive to find the file you want to post, then just select it and click "Upload". It will automatically resize the image to fit in the normal width of the thread. You can still see the full size image just by clicking the image in the post. See mine below. Go ahead! Click it! You can magnify it once it opens in the new window.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
yes indeed ken, thank you, i will do it next time

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hello Waterflame. I realized what you meant about not waiting for the signal from the crossover alert indicator. I got a short signal later in the day on the USDJPY one hour chart but it was after the candle had formed ( well after) and I'd missed the best entry. So anyway, I was pittling around and tried some other settings for the alert indicator and I was wondering if you've ever tried using the 34 as a linear weighted moving average rather than the simple moving average? On the chart it appears to form about one candle earlier than using SMA, and I assume the crossover indicator would give the signal earlier. It's without a doubt a great system as is. I was just wondering as to your opinion on it. Don't want to waste my time if it's a bad idea. Regards, Ken

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Ken, hi Waterflame, and hi everyone else. Let me first congratulate Waterflame for this simple, yet very effective method. I haven't used it yet though, but what i see on the chart looks like more than a 90% accuracy, depending on discipline and strict adherence to the rules. I agree with Kenmannia's effort to create an alert for this system, as it is possible to sit for long waiting for a signal and miss it just when you had to answer a call or something. The alert must however be such that it comes at the precise time, as this system succeeds best when one is right on time.(It is at times like these that i really wish i could code!). If anyone out there could make an ea out of this, it would be even better. Thanks again to all of you trying to make this system work at it's best.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
a EA for backtesting this would be great, to give alerts at accurate time would be also great so far i will give it s try to code it.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
does anyone know how long it takes to load 2 years of history into mt4? i loaded the offline chart with my history data but it´s still in prosessing for over 20 minutes now... i am on a iMac with 2 gb, this can´t take so long, or?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Regards, Flame

--- 帖子 #92 ---
loading the history data is still processing, now already for over 2 hours...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
To Andigho and liOuid, ( thanks Andigho, you are welcome man ) im sure that an EA will do the work too, giving profits, but basicely we trust our cognitive thinking by observation and understanding the entry conditions, even if mostly every entry can result success, a machine will execute signals, and not understand the fact that the market is alive have moods on what we react again ( that is where an Ea can effect greater stop losses as we can stop manualy, imagine a news event, and a too late signal, it will be a disaster, maybe 3 days of profit blown away, a great reason why i don't use EA's). For me is to trade manualy enjoying to make my business, where only myself will be responsible for my acts.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
water, i agree with you.. a fully automated system demands good nerves if you not at home i think a good fully developed alert system that analyses charts and gives you early signals could be an edge so you don´t have to stay the hole day watching the charts if you trade longer timeframes with your system

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Lol buddy, you wil maybe do all to get almost of everything doing nothing, even a bureaucratique work will demand from you to be all the day at office, just tradig can let you work freely and home, doing sport excercise while trading, having a glass of wine, are talking with your girlfriend until making money. If you have a regulated working time from morning to evening, trading the euro session, you can go out doing a ballade nights, and enjoy the week ends, buy a PDA for Metatrader at cell phone or something

--- 帖子 #96 ---
water, since when you are testing this system and do you allready trading this system live? did you any kind of backtesting ? what about the roi, could you may give any percentage success rates you having with this system, what timeframe, what pairs and how much trades you mainly do with it? tnx

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Okay, I think I understand. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
After Demo test 3 monthes, 1 year and 9 monthes ago, and live trading 1 year and a half, i had my first results, making at least every pair , 2 trades with profit, every day that means i trade 4 pairs x 2 = 8 trades a day x 5 = 40 trades a week the max loosing of 40 trades a week are 7 max. the minimum profit of a trade are 10 pips x 40 trades = at least 400 pips a week The maximum Loss by a stop loos loosing are 15 pips x 7 loosing trades = are 105 pips loss 400 pips min profit - 105 max loss = 295 pips in the pocket if you Martingale this system, imagine what will your success and monthly income be. I will not make you dreaming, but this are facts, you can Test yourself.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
can i ask with how much you started live and what your maximal risk is for every trade.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
hehe , you will laugh, i started with 300 Euro, and i used the 2% rule of max risk, but with the stop loss rules we have, you will not need any risk management, and i suggest for you to start with min 500 $, i had a hard time to not fall in stop loss with my low capital ( because it was the only money i had ) , but after flourishing, and being disciplined for the rules, i didn't care anymore.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
i am planing to start with about 5 or 10 k but i will keep on testing your system for the next 2-3 month it´s looks not to complicated even to a beginner like me, i am sure with disciplin and hard work i will get it, i hope so... i started trading last year without any system, trading plan or money management and took almost 10% risk on a trade on 1:100, so what happened.. i burned down my 5k desposit to a 49$ one. i don´t wana do such crap again even if i will make losses i hope to have get an overall profit the next time no matter if it´s 100 pips or 10 pips the month, just trading it well and learning by doing it.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
the system concept is made for everykind of traders, thus who have low and great capital, bascly to even if you just have low capital, wining with it, but if you realy wanna make an Ea i suggest to use it at least for the 1H ( 1h chart and bigger timeframes gives more profit, and realy just a few fake signals with stop loss ) ( but higher timeframes need more balance capital and begin just with 1 volume )

--- 帖子 #103 ---
cool, sounds great. i will check this out with an EA, but i think i will better go the manual way first. anyway thanks for sharing your experience and your great simple system with us that even newbies like me can understand and work it out.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Read the rules, and just do what they say, never be anxious or something while trading, be a relaxed and watch the chart, if you have a signal, go in, if you have a signal to go out, exit, thats it, no hard work anymore, neither trandlines, support resistance, HH LL, Fibs, complicated 7 different MA's at once Support Resistance conditions to analyze, Just one and only one signal for entry, one for the stop loss, and your choice where to exit to book profits.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
i still doesn´t know what it takes so long to load this f#cking historical data. it´s weekend and i want to test some trades

--- 帖子 #106 ---
For people looking for a "hard exit" rule, you might check out TEB's simple system thread. I've used a combination of other methods with TEB's method and it works very well. I'm amazed at how often both of the targets are hit, especially on the lower time frames. Here's a chart with showing yesterday's short signal on the USDJPY 1 hour chart from the Elite system, and TEB's Fibonnaci tool that shows the potential exits. One exit has already been taken out for 41 pips. I'd be shocked if the second exit isn't taken out also for an additional 41. TEB's method gets the "planned" exit, but I believe 9 times out of ten Elite will get you in the trade sooner. (just my opinion...haven't extensively backtested it). We can watch this trade and see how many (if any) pips are left on the table.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Ken, thank you for this post, i know and have followed the threads of TEB very well, and its one of the best traders here in FF, if you ajust yourself to this conditions and knowledge, adding to Elite, you results will be major. I have created Elite for the simple man like me and other no knowing real science of trading to make it a living, but if you award further experience it will help you aswell, thanks for posting every real help other traders will need. regards and respect, Flame

but with all respect, we dont need the kuskus ( even if im moroccan ) , I trend or RSI, please keep it simple for yourself ( the reason why to keep it simple is, many indicators will give you many signals, many signals sometimes do not acurate to real signal, you will be disturbed and maybe take the false descision, why using many when just a few tells you its right ? ) Its like having many friends who use you for nothing, and having a few friends helping you all your life§

i will spend for you the next 2 weeks to help you Life trading and giving trading critics and helping you to get the system. Almost all was said and all rules explained. If you even have not understood something, do not have any worries to ask about them here in this thread, every information is welcome for newcomers. I hope other traders folowing this System will help others, because sometimes i have other business to do, but i will present and answer when i have time, i just give back to existance what life have done for me, helping me to have a simple life , the only thing i will please you to do, is helping others. Rules are explained, discussions about the most important questions answered, now its about you to work for yourself. Best wishes, Karim Marbouh

You are choosing yourself pathes of life, if your intelligence tell to yourself after understanding its the right way, trust yourself... ( about myself, i had many false friends, many false ppl telling me false things, and being down, i will not be this kind of persons killing others ) follow the rules of the system and try it out yourself Kev, follow them and try them out, its all i can tell you, after my own experience

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Please post and argument you own trades the next 2 weeks for others, i will respond to help you if you have questions

Saturday night, i go enjoy, have a nice week end until monday european opening

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks for being open to it, Flame. It's pretty apparent that your system is a major pip-producer just on its own. I just know a lot of traders like to know where the out-door is before they walk through the in-door. regards and HIGHEST respect back to ya, Ken

--- 帖子 #118 ---
why did you remove them kevin, i haven't yet download them to see your proposition, please give them back to us...

Lol, i understand what you mean Ken, me too i had the problem at first to find where the entry door is

Waterflame, I've been trading live for about 6 months now. Moderate success, mostly due to bad/late entries. I think your Price Action method is very sound and much simpler than other price action plans I have seen. I will be incorporating your system into mine starting on Sunday night. I back tested it against trades I have already made (live) and had I been using this set of indicators, I am sure my failures would be much less and my entries would have been much better. The result will be more pips for me.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
could somebody help me on with backtesting data, i am searching quality one good for testing this system, i tried to found the data from ibfx, northfinance... but no luck finding any download link

--- 帖子 #122 ---
you mentioned ibfx , so this assumes your using metatrader..... the platform should have ample data 'as is' ...... you can force download more historical quotes by using the left arrow..... it will scroll to the left of the chart, just keep clicking the arrow to download.... if your lookin for much more history, you can download from several data banks..... alpari is a pretty good one i use..... http://www.alpari-idc.com/en/dc/databank.html you'll need to use the period convertor to convert the minute data to higher timeframes and then import into your history folder.... if your new to backtesting a point worth noting..... it's best to use a separate platform for backtesting..... you can have any number of platforms on your computers, so having a special platform for alpari will assure the differing broker quotes don't mix.....h

Hi, I am just wondering if you would be kind enough to post the sup/res indicator on your chart. It would be very usefull for me to use the code in an EA im currently making. Chears in advance! LoLo

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Waterflame ! Congratulations for introducing this method. I'm trading this for a longer time and I'm satisfied with the results. In the long term it's not possible to run an EA because you get too many losses in a ranging market. I'd tested this and was not successful ;-( So folks trade this system manually and if you could handle it by paying attention to money management and discipline, this will be a gold mine !! Just my 2 cents. P.S. Waterflame could you post the indicator which is showing market open and close by drawing coloured vertical lines ? Thanks in advance and happy trading ;-))

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I am sure you can develop an profitable EA for this as well. You need something like an artificial neural network (ANN) that will take care of market vibes to be successfull long-term with the EA, otherwise no chance.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
It's the standard fib tool from MT4, with the settings changed to reflect: 0- for the 0% line (Stop Loss) 0.5- for the 50% line 1- for the 100% line (Trigger) 2-for the 200% line (Target 1) 3- for the 300% line (Target 2) Here's a template with the fib settings on it. You know if you open the template and open the "fibo properties" and just change the fib color it will make the settings on it the new "default" settings for your platform. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
hi, Waterflame! cci 34 cross 0 and and sma34 cross price line(or MA1) - you looking basically on a same thing (like use macd with same MAs - instead confirming they just show same thing) but well, if you found - this set (combination) works the best for this strategy... could you tell again what you do for filtering false signals; for flat, narrow range and chop conditions? thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[img=http://www.abload.de/thumb/macd7gf.gif] Indeed it was my attention to synchronise the 3 Ema - 34 Sma Cross witht the CCI 34 zero line cross ( to have one confirming strong signal for entry ) After discovered this entry method of a fast but not sloppy 3 Ema entry, with a not too far on not too near at price trending 34 Sma for profits and giving just the sprerad stop loss, i needed something to have even if the market has a fake signal, to exit with profit. CCI has this wonderfull % levels, what you can't use in Macd, Macd was made for convergence/ divergence http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/...annelindex.asp http://www.investopedia.com/articles...cal/082701.asp http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp and not like CCI for a Momentum overbought and oversold strategic tool you can use for both things, entry and exit neither RSI with the overbought and oversold concept, even if it has entry ( and its not synchronized to our MA combination ) has no good exits the classic stochastic is not specialized to signal entries from trend ( short term/mid term/long term) because we need an entry from the begining of the trend, and having profit of all the potentiality of it, also the exits are not very momentum price related. about your question to the cadles, i will make in this days some different shot animations of price behaviours, so you can see the healthy mooding market good entry candles, and the to great spiking sick market candles, where i disencourage you to enter a position in this conditions.

thanks behof, i will post in a few something i have foud for an EA, even if i am not very enchated by mechanical trading, i wish to give it a try. later

--- 帖子 #133 ---
kenmania, if you allow me to say that a 3 Ema crossing 34 Sma method would maybe easier to trade for an Ea, because my self sometimes i don't trade the whole trade, and exit to cover profit with CCI exits, just to get quick money and don't to wait all the time for the finish of the trade. According to the price near 3 Ema what even if 3 Ema reverse to the 34 Sma will not have a great stop loss, if it continous, the profits would be very funny. Not like if its based just of CCI, and taking axit by the 100% or 200% level, when the Trend maybe just wish to take a breath for a new ride and taking just a few of it. Look at your best Tranding pairs at the one 1h, and count from 3 monthes before, how much stop loss trades, how much good trades with few profit, and at most count the profit of pips of the big trades, and tell me if the 3 Ema crossing 34 Sma method, with min 500$, trading 1 volume not work.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
here is an EA i have found this morning in another forum http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...-cross-ea.html please can someone see if it works, when yes, back test the 3 Ema crossing 34 Sma, and show us the Results, because i don't have the faculty of it... im curious about it thanks

Checks and Balances? http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/...6/backtest.gif Hey WaterFlame. Here is my original idea. I did not want to use mandrake to replace waterflame.tpl. Waterflame.tpl is perfect as it is and it could not be more simple. What I was thinking about is a potential inticator/system that could give waterflame.tpl a confirmation signal on entry and exit. A system/indicator that could spot this "sick"/"slow" price action for us so we make more winning trades and can get out early if the trade is bad. I am mainly thinking about using the indicators you see at the bottom for this. This is what the updated .tpl would look like: http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/...terflame22.gif You have already made trading more simple for everyone trading your system, but recognizing price action is still a skill that takes time to master. So my question is do you know of any indicators for the noob trader to use to stay away from trading "slow/sick" markets or is it just a matter of studying the current market conditions? One flaw I can see with my idea is that it will reduce the total number of trades and will also give worse entries because the trader would have to wait for the 15m candle to close before possibly entering a trade. I will be back testing this strategy today to let you know what I find. This is a great thread Flame. I noticed most your charts you have posted are U/J 30m so this is what I will use for the test. Thanks again. -Kevin PS: Would you like me to remove the mandrake files to keep your thread on track?

Hi WaterFlame, Here is my slight variation of your system, MTF stochs help me filter some signals, not all, they just confirm my entries. Here is an example, you can see the stochs (price) is moving in the other direction, therefore this would filter the signal on a 5 minute chart. Though you have to understand, that in MTF, the candle might have closed on your current time frame, but the other time frame the candle might not have closed, therefore with back testing this filter will look good, but when actually trading it will not be easy, as you can enter trades too soon and not realise and see price go in the other direction, though WaterFlame's entries will make things more simpler, as now I have a entry signal, which I did not have before and hopefully this will be my holy grail... If we can improve on this, then lets do it! Regards, Guess

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Right... Look at these 4 signals on the 5 min chart CADJPY. Signal 1 I would have taken, 1hour, 30min stochs are up, 15min and 5 min, are turning up, plus we have a signal, we have a double bottom, TAKE TRADE. Signal 2 Not taken, 5 and 15min stochs are moving down, but 1hour and 30min are still near oversold, would take more time to move down. Signal 3 You can see 1hour and 30min showing some direction now, so we wait for a down signal. Signal 4 Confirmation of down trend on 1hour, 30min and 15min is flat and 5 min moving down. TRADE TAKEN. Hope this helps! Let's improve this if we can, but I have too many indicators, as most people. Though I think we need some form of MTF approach. Regards, Guess

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Ohh by the way... this is from Spuds MTF Stoch approach, I take no credit for the MTF approach.

One of the guys here sended me a message ( i will not reveal the name ) for an indicator of how to define market condtions with Murray Math or another indicator. Me personally i dont have the time just to reach a Murrey Math Level just to see if it continous or consolidate, we need something what tell us what will heppens now, not after. ( Read Market conditions ; if you can imporve it, please do it, but keep it simple ) Thank you man for the MSG

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I hope this system doesn't get ruined by adding in other indicators, I think WaterFlame your right by saying not to be greedy, and just take your profits and be happy with them sometimes. Personally, if i need confirmation that the signal is right, i'll just cross check with another chart and system setup on another platform. I think I may use the ADX with DMI indicator that i use on another chart setup on another pc to help keep me out of bad/choppy market conditions. Cant wait till monday to trade from london open, so excited, and I hope people will post some chart setups of signals they find to help others. Im going to post my charts for signals as often as i can. Thanks waterflame, i agree with keeping it simple.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Water, I think it's just natural for all to try to improve what you have presented to us (thanks again!), but what I have determined is you need nothing else. I have been reviewing this system for the past 3 or 4 days, checking many pairs at all different time frames, and I have determined there is no need for anything else (at least for me). Bottom line is if you follow the rules, the pips will follow (and follow and follow and follow). Finding the holy grail is very subjected, this system is mine, it will provide pips, where my other trades took them away.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Waterflame. i think your system is very good .i dont use any indicators .Just pure PA and fractal confirmation in the daily(always with the trend). The thing that i like in your system is that it can scalp at lower time frames(i use min 1h for scalping) with tight stoploss. Some comments for the newbies here: 1.dont add more indicators(it already has plenty) 2.Waterflame says its a succesfull system.Dont try to CHANGE it... 3.i know you feel that adding something more makes you feel more confident.i have passed that face too. 4.there is nothing to tell you the market rythm other than pure price action.just watch many hours just one pair and in a few days you will be experts. 5.throw away your indicators that only tell you what happened in the past and keep it simple and short(KISS). 6.Nice job Waterflame just my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Waterflame- Let me be sure I understand your rules. The MAs must cross on the same bar that the CCI crosses 0- Is that correct? It's difficult to tell, but your charts appear to show some entries when the MAs and CCI cross a bar or two out of sync. Thanks

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi all, i have the standard cci indicator on mt4 (see attatched image) can you tell me how i can make the 0 line stand out.. caus i couldn't find out how to..

--- 帖子 #148 ---
hey car...... click on the cci to bring up the parameters and select levels..... change the weight and/or color to make the line stand out...... or you could just write a indicator which will paint the bar a specfic color when the combination crosses up/down..... keep in mind, unless i'm mistaken , he is not using the standard cci......h

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hello waterflame, I wish the world was filled with people more like you.You seem genuine in your offerings.I have one question on the system though.You mention in this post of a 15 pip stop limit.Is that a hard stop you stand by with ever trade?Thanks in advance!!Good trading to you!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
excellent system waterflame. don't add any more indicators. I see too many systems on here that start simple and then before you know it its not simple anymore. If we all stick to 15 min time frames we should be ok. I trade 11 currency pairs and take a profit at 2 pips for each. no losses yet. I have an excell spread sheet that calcs how many pips to get in order to make so much by the end of the year and how many lots to trade by the balance in your acct. happy trading

--- 帖子 #151 ---
guys, don't worry, other indicators can't ruin system all new presented systems on all public forums coming threw this stage (and i believe Waterflame already been there (and been researching this system much longer then we do) - brainstorm - good thing, if system solid - no problem, it can withstand (sure we need to be polite and not distruct the thread too much) : ))) ADX, volatility tools, LRS, squeeze first comes to mind on flat - but i see what Water mean - cci34 shows narrow range +-100 (even50) same and earlier than adx14; volatility (or atr) below trading range - we need just number, and it can be referred to market conditions

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Any chance you could share that spreadsheet?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
sure, here you go

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thanks for the spreadsheet! I am looking at my charts and I find a lot of the time the CCI and the MA's don't cross at the same time.Theres a lot more times it does not cross correcty.Did I set something up wrong or is this just the way it is? Thanks again.I have attached a chart. P.S the normal CCI seems to give more signals.....

--- 帖子 #155 ---
thank you guys, im happy we found together on this thread discussing success. about the question of " bilbss " and jlmac27, as we talked yet about momentum faking what perhaps can sometimes appear, we have set up the rules of not to trade when Signals are not in synchronisation http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...6&amp;postcount=49 and Candle bars are too big while entry is confirming http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...4&amp;postcount=52 the big candle thing can result in market condition moods http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=40 they will be the only times where you will have a no go! ( and they appear not very often, if they appear, you know you will not trade them ) and to answer of the 15 pips hard stop question jlmac27, in the 15 min timeframe, none of the pairs you will trade, ( even very profitable as gbp/jpy, will not break with a candle more above 15 to 20 pips at one time ( the links above are defining price action hints ) , and you will have your last stop loss exit, just if you have been sleeping not watching your charts and interact before. ( news time not counting ) Read News a day before ( if you are not a news trader, dont trade news events time)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
a big thank you to all of you for your kind words, me too i have learned a lot from others, and it was time to give the results back of what i have learned.

Maybe I am looking a this wrong...Refer to my chart above.The first CCI settings 34 synchronizes alomst everytime with the MA's.But the woodies does not..we are looking at the red line on the woodies to confirm right?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
jlmac27 you have to change the woodies settings go to woodie CCI properties: Set Trend CCI Period to :34 and change the color, because its default black, and you will not see it on your black background. Set the color of Entry CCI to none to disappear Disable Show LSMA to false

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Here's another question- You say not to enter on big bars. What is a big bar? How do you define "big"? Below is a chart you posted of good entries. The last two entries you show appear to be huge bars- 8 or 10 x their previous bars.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I think he was just throwing somthing up as an example. Each pair will have different size candles based on that pair. You will have to use some inititive and define what is big to you I think. Flame might have more insight. Lately each pair has seen huge volitility at certain times, but I define a larger than normal candle by what my stop loss used to be for a currency pair. I used a 60-80 pip stop loss for P/J and G/C, 40 for G/U and U/J and 30 for E/U. If I see candles that are this big on my 15m charts I will consider these big candles. My new stop losses have changed to reflect the rules waterflame has descibed. Thanks for having the patience to answer all our questions Karim. -Kevin Here is another video you might enjoy. Someone posted this on aus's call room last week. Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #165 ---
He was throwing that chart up with the expressed intent of showing proper entrances. That's why I am trying to reconcile his stated rules with the charts he shows. There appears to be some contradictions.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks for your reply hayseed.. i know waterflame uses another one but the said the standard was ok. btw if i open the properties of the cci i can change the style but that is for all the lines.. i only want the zero line to stand out.. anyone any suggesstions

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I will prepare something for you, give me a moment. There are no contradictions, but maybe my lack of language to explain you properly what i mean. Visuals will make it easier to understand!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
If you have MT4 you can download the indicator that was posted earlier in this thread.If not the regular CCI with a 34 setting works.I have the levels -200,-100,0,100,200 on mine to get a feel for where I need to exit the trade.I am waiting anxiously for a trade now....sleeping threw the london...damn!!Maybe tomorrow asian session will get me in..good trading to you all!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Should we base a "big" candle based upon the average size from the previous day session? Practically everyday has news, what do you do when you have open positions, do you close them or just tighten the stops?

Long with two mini lots on EURUSD 15 min @ 1.5778 and 1.5880. Take profits @ 1.5813 and 1.5841 (two pips below targets). SL @ 1.5757.

how come it shows stop loss and targets ?? thanks goodbadMAS

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I'm combining Elite with TEB63's system . It's really an experiment. Elite seems to give the earlier entry signals (especially on longer time frames), TEB shows me where to get out and set my SL.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I think his question is: is there an indicator that prints those targets as shown in your chart?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
See HERE .

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Oh yeah...and the targets will be basically meaningless unless applied to TEB63's method. Well...they can still work, but they're designed to be effective with the 1-2-3 swing trading method and having the 200 SMA in the right place. At this point I'm only using the targets if those criteria are in place, along with the Elite signal. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Also on this GBPJPY long trade on the hourly. This one should yield some nice pips if it works. EDIT: I'm abandoning the targets on this trade. It doesn't meet the criteria for a 1-2-3 swing, not to mention the fact that the Elite signal came on an extremely long candle. This one will likely be stopped out.

Kenmannia, Here's a template with the fib settings on it. You know if you open the template and open the "fibo properties" and just change the fib color it will make the settings on it the new "default" settings for your platform. I don't see "fibo properties" in the template you listed. Can you provide any additional help on how to apply the fib's indicator. Thanks Mitch

--- 帖子 #192 ---
ELITE???? lol

--- 帖子 #193 ---
If you throw the template on a USDJPY 1 Hour chart you should see the fib right there. Otherwise, open it on any chart, right-click the chart and select "Objects List". When the objects menu pops up, scroll down to where it says "Fibo", select it by clicking on it, then click "edit". The Fibo menu will pop up. From this point, if you make any change, like changing the color or the line width of the fibs, that fib tool and all of its properties will become your new "default" fib tool. You can revert back to the MT4 fibo level defaults by clicking "Defaults" under the "Fibo Levels" tab.

Hi Folks ! Attached you will find an actual snapshot of GBP/USD on a 15min chart. I waited for the first trendline break and went short. My stop loss was the last highest swing point. My exit was after the break of the second trend line. On CCI Indikator I saw a divergence against price and went long. I bailed out at the 50% Fib Level. These are my additional tools in trading this system : 1. Fib levels (mostly 50% level as target) 2. Demark Trendline breaks 3. Divergence 4. Round numbers I'm using max. 3% of my entire account for one trade. My stop loss is always the last swing point (works as support/resistance). I have 3 screens with the following pairs : - GBP/USD - USD/JPY - GBP/JPY I'm using USD/JPY as my leading pair and trade off the GBP/JPY. They correlate nice Happy trading Bernhard

Hey Waterflame, Very nice simple method. I have read every thread on FF and I must say for the newbie to the "old dogs" this is a great simple price action trading style.

Waterflame, Jumped in live last night on a perfect set-up of GBP/CHF. Woke up this morning to find a little present of 125 pips, best Monday in a long time. I will figure out how to post a chart to help demonstrate how "simple" this set-up is. Thanks Mitch

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Very nice Mitch to take screenshot of your charts, you will find here http://www.abload.de/img/saveas0mq.gif

Hi WaterFlame, Got to say, pretty good system, I've made a few scalps! Thanks, Guess

isn´t that a long postion after a big candle, you told me not do to? :-)

3 trades loss : 300 $ Loss 10 trades win : 2164 $ Win http://www.abload.de/img/accoutnhistoryzk7.gif Im done for today, European session will close in a few. Tomorrow is a new day

--- 帖子 #211 ---
no, they seem just now like that, because i didn't took the screenshot from the entry, at first we had an advertising candle, and than a confirming one. ( but i was in eur/jpy a little bit ealrier, i was agressive, but its my responsabelity, you have to follow the rules, become a habit to trade them, and with a little bit time, you too you will know in before what the market will do )

--- 帖子 #212 ---
great

--- 帖子 #213 ---
great system, thank you. can you please clarify, do I enter in the candle that takes the 3 ema across or do I wait for that candle to close and then enter?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Excellent trading~ you're trading more than 4pairs I see. Do you ever sleep?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
wait for that candle to close and then enter! and than enter the postion with the new candle

--- 帖子 #216 ---
lol, yes, i sleep too, but week days not much

--- 帖子 #217 ---
some of the guys here demanded me to show a graphical example of sick market and lazy market Stop loss, i will trade it for sample, and show you how, when and why i exit. It will be described in 2 stop loss conditions: - the normal Stop loss - and the last hard stop loss you will need to observe the market conditions how the trade will progress, this will define if you exit from the begining with the normal stop loss, or if the trade have some hope to continue, when not there will be the hard stop loss. please have patience until this trades will be made.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I was conscient about the exit weaknesses in this concept, and after talking with you everytime more about it, and seing also your results in the poll, i knew that the last problematic will be to find something what will not stop you out too fast, ( not just taking profit from the first scalping candles ) but will also protect. The result will give us more profit earning as entry candle scalps or 100% 200% CCI exits , less profit loosing from a reversal until awaiting the next entry signal, and stop loss at the same time. Based on same demands as the 34 variable, not being to near or too far from the optimum conditions. It will not be much more complicated as simple it is, and the rules also, just a litle addition and optimisation, no difficult rules or indication analysis. ( the point is to keep it simple and effective as much we can ). At least we search the perfect strategy Entry , Exit , Stop Loss until now we had the Entry , and stop loss, and we finish with the Exit The post will be released in a few time.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I always thought exits were a personal thing. On any given day, my tolerance level changes and so do my lots. Some days, I may be happy with 10 pips and other days I may hold overnight with a trailing stop. What you have done here Karim is simplified the entry process. Don't complicate things. Many boneheads will pass thru here and offer more and more crap. Keep It Simple . I studied Woodies method many years ago and moved on to other things and here I am again foaming at the mouth over the simplicity of it all. We tend to complicate it when it doesn't need to be.

Morocco was made famous in the sixties for it's hashish. There was even a song by Crosby, Stills and Nash called the Marrakesh Express. It was a popular route for traveling hippies during the mid-to-late 1960s who sought out this Moroccan city for its mythical Arabic appearance, and maybe for its renowned hashish .

It appears that you take signals in either direction (long/short) with no regard to what the trend may be on higher timeframes. Is that right? Thanks for sharing this method.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Salam, Thank you for sharing the system. Permission to try,

--- 帖子 #223 ---
It will only be a proposition, the most important was revealed, the entry, stop loss assured with a minimum loss... The system will not change, and the rules for entry and stop loss will not change too let me give it a try

--- 帖子 #224 ---
haha, yes indeed and thanks for the song

Hello, I tried this system live today with good results.I think I found a trading style I am now comfortable with.Are you showing live trades or demo in your posts?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
all live, i m trading this now for 1 year and a half, but was variating from time to time the variables for the Trending SMA ( 34 ) as i got for about 6 monthes definitely this number, fiting atmost the market in all conditions and timeframes, i was assured of it. The 3 Ema was discovered at least, because i was tired of the 5 and Ema too late entries, i have traded for a while just with price action breakouts at line charts. [img=http://www.abload.de/thumb/eurusdmomentoooc.gif] but this is another story

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi Waterflame, A very good question from a member on the higher TF's. Do you take counter trend trades as much as you would trade with the trend. Hey...scalping is not a bad way to play the game but just curious if you have traded longer term TF's. Thanks for all your posts!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
if i realy trade higher timeframes ( 1h ) , i trade the full signal way only 3ema - 34 sma , cci for momentum entry help no counter trends if it begins to weak, i cut and get profits, when not i let profits run

--- 帖子 #231 ---
The GBPCHF does well with the system~

--- 帖子 #232 ---
This one is stubborn but I think it may pay off later during the London session~

--- 帖子 #233 ---
This a clear signal but I'm going to pass because of the time of day, the overall trend of the pair and long candle...what are your thoughts WF?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hey summitfx, how do you get the arrows to appear. Do you have a special indicator. if so can you please post it. Many thanks Ed

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Waterflame How do you tell if a market is one of the following: - Sick ( too volatile and extreme aggresive with spikes ) ranging - Lazy ( slow ) In my opinion, one usually cannot see such markets until after the fact. Is there some other method you are using to identify such a market?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
As i said, nothing will be changed for the initial entry or stop loss technics. Another SMA will be added for Exit : - 10 Sma ( the 10 Sma will not let you exit so fast as like the 8 Sma ) The exit rules for CCI will also not be changed, if with the entry CCI weak, get your few pips and exit. If CCI continous over 100% , and just in case you reach more than 35 pips in a trade, than you can use the 10 Sma for exit Reasons will be explained on chart. There are also somethings explained what you have not to do with the 10 Sma, it was only added for a better exit with potential profits. The lines with definitions will explain the use of everything. Circles with numbers will give descrition of the use in the areas. ( this numbers will be in green ) (read the describtion under the image, it will take a few place in the chart and will confusing while watching the chart ) http://www.abload.de/img/activechartmkp.gif 1 - As usual we enter with a 3 Ema - 34 Sma cross ( Confirming Candle ) signal. ( all showing circles with entries will have the number "1" ) 2 - The new feature is the Exit with 10 Sma , it will allows you to get the most of the moving trend ( if its a good one ) , before closing your position too fast, fearing to loose your profits. ( all showing circles with 10 Sma exits will have the number "2" ) If the move don't occurs, we remember the CCI exit rules. Notice : Never Use the 10 Sma for counter trends ( the trend is your friend, it dont worth it ) Never trade with 10 Sma continuations, they maybe fakes ( dont be greedy, wait for the next entry ) 3 - This one shows you the CCI exit if its weakening ( observe also the candle ) to not loosing your few pips by the scalp, not to loose your spread, or get in stop loss Stop Loss rules are not changed! Thats it, enjoy

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Here you go- just set up according to WF's rules. I like my charts clean but WF makes a good argument for having the MA's appear on your charts. This indie will also buzz you on a cross which is handy!

Did you even try? 3/1/0 34/0/0

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Maybe it's me, but I find than this MA crossover signal you show have something wrong... arrow are 1 bar late than mine. What do you think ? PS : Thank you WaterFlame for your so simple system

It's probably the settings but I'll take a quicker signal if it's there. Gracias'

10 Sma exit Added

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Have you thought this thru Mr. Flame?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
yes because its not something changing, and its an additional help, everything is still as it was. the 10 Sma is just helping for exit ( in case what i have wrote ) read it, and read it again we use the indicators for 3 things Entry , Exit , Stop loss not for retracements, extensions or support resistance. and its not something difficult, as like fancy indicators its still the simple system

--- 帖子 #248 ---
OK Boss-I'm with you Let's not get to this point- Been there done that~

--- 帖子 #249 ---
rofl surely not, we have now all we need, i thank you all atmost to give me the kick for th brainstorming, without you i would continue scalping

--- 帖子 #250 ---
You really trade with all this indics ?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Healthy Mood = Candles form with normal speed and continues the way of the position Sick Mood = Candles coming very fast back and forward and are huge ( see stop loss and the BIG NO GO CANDLES, stop loss is like the entry rule, same thing ) Lazy Mood = Candles form up very slow, going just creepy in some direction, and have just a few pips

--- 帖子 #252 ---
No I'm basically a naked trader. You can see I'm hedged in that particular trade so I might as well have been using all those indicators.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
If you want the signal a bar earlier, change the setting for the 34 from simple to Linear Weighted Moving Average. Also, no matter what settings you have the indicator at, you won't get an alert until the close of the bar where the cross occurs. You'll miss some pips on the entry a lot of times. If you want an earlier heads-up on a set up try the CCIFilter_VX(2) indicator attached. It will give you an audible alert and pop-up box with a "dot" on the chart as the cross of the zero line is happening . If you act now I'll also include a template with the new indicator laid over Waterflame's CCI indicator and the settings matched as closely as possible to the system settings. They aren't exact, but if you compare them they're pretty darn close. ONLY $49.99 U.S. (price goes up tomorrow). PayPal accepted. :

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Waterflame said in earlier post to wait for candle to close before entry, so I guess the alert is o.k. ? Thank you for the alert

--- 帖子 #258 ---
WF thanks for the system... Just to be clear... 1) Because of CCI nature (and if I'm not wrong) we will always have CCI zero cross first. Then we wait for 3 EMA crossing 34 SMA. If it happens on same bar continue with 2); else, no trade and we wait for new CCI zero cross. 2) As soon as 3 EMA crosses 34 SMA we enter a trade with 15 pips hard Stop Loss. (or we can wait for the bar to close but lets say we are in "aggressive mode"). 3) If everything goes right, by the close of the bar we should be in positive pips. From now on, we wait for exit signals, i.e. CCI/Candle weakness, 10 SMA cross, CCI 100%, 200% reversals, etc. ELSE WHAT ? What happens if the candle closes lower than our entry? or even there is no 3/34 cross any more ? Should we wait for hard stop ? should we exit inmediatly ? Could you be so kind to confirm me if I'm right in the first 3 points, and write a little more on those last questions ? Thanks in advance Regards Mariano

--- 帖子 #259 ---
LOL, you should see the other version of my avatar. My eyes actually shift back and forth. I can't use it here cuz FF doesn't allow animated avatars.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
You're welcome. Waiting for the candle to close is probably-YES- the best idea. But WF also said it's good to see the price action of the candle (while it's forming). The alert will just help you know a set up as its happening ahead of time so you're in the best position to know if you want to take the trade without babysitting 14 charts waiting for set ups.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
That's really cool Ken- So I'll get an alert with each Dot. Awesome!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
yes but please read next post

--- 帖子 #263 ---

Waterflame: Thanks for your system and your helping attitude. Within a few days of starting this thread, it has already nearly 15,000 views. I want to start demoing your system before it becomes too big. Can you or some one please point out the best templates/indicators to us newbies as there are already many of them in this thread? Also, I am in the west coast (USA, PST) and only have time during the evening. Can you pl suggest some good time to have a better probability of getting trades using your system, best pairs and the time frame? I know, it depends but still I will appreciate your knowledgable guess. Thanks in advance for your (or any others) reply. FX_California

According simulation for entry signals : - I wrote to be attentive of the price action of CCI crossi zero line - watch the Advertising candle if its not too big and observe if 3 Ema is near 34 Sma - when the Confirming candle appears ( for example its a long trade ) above the 34 Sma and begin to rise with 2 or 3 pips, enter the position ( according iwith the 3 Ema yellow line is too over the 34 Sma

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Just found this thread the other day. is bang on with the simplicity theory. had been testing a simaliar method that i came up with for the past couple of months (althought this one is better). looking forward to making some pips from it. Whats been the results so far using this method using the h4 charts? Might be worth someone, if not a few people login up a weekley report of there results, just to keep everyone up to speed on the progess.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I have promissed to post all my trades during this next 2 weeks live trading, and posting at time here in this thread. Personally 4h is too huge for me to trade, i withdraw my money because i need it, and will not have enough capital to survive a long time in 4h timeframs without a bit risk capital to secure Stop loss ( even if i woul be very profitable ) and i dont have the patience to monitor 4h trades.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
cheers waterflame, i have to look at the h4 as most of the week i cant get internet access during the day only evenings.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Those Dots are like Mexican jumping jelly beans- they keep you hopping!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Question for someone here... When exiting because of weakening CCI are you waiting until a bar closes and if cci is now pointing the wrong way get right out? And on an entry where price gives you an entry then shoots right back on you, get right out where you entered? Hopefully i am following this correctly

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Salam Waterflame, better put this info to the #1 post. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Yesturday was a great day for me trading this new system. I have to admit I did use a couple other indicators that I use to help me recognize and confirm my entries. The best part about my trading last night is I was able to stay out of a couple trades a "professional" trader I follow made that went negative on him. The next couple days for me will be the real test to see if my success continues or not. Asia seems kinda slow today and I woke up late so I will not be trading the asian session today. The E/U looks to me to be "lazy" along with some other pairs right now so I wait for London. Good luck today you guys. -Kevin

--- 帖子 #275 ---
still lack "big candle" definition? nobody came with clear criteria? (how much is too big - or not too big?) post 171 - "monster, you kidding me, NONO, etc" a bit vague - hardy a clear definition

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi, there, This system is so simple and effective, that it can be free! Thank's Waterflame and everyone of you for the contribution. For some early entry/exitsignals, you can use a 34 EMA overlayed on the CCi window.Every cross between EMA &amp; CCi it can be a warning. Just look and give it a shot. And of course, if you spend a little time to study the CCi patterns and behaviour (I think Woodie CCi will be a great source), you will have more info coming from this indicator on what the price it will do next... P.S. I've maded a backtest since oct 2007 till now, and I manage to get 95% profit trades! Highest percent system till now....I also use 14 tCCi for a better view and as a profit target I have borrowed some EMA's fib levels from the Vegas tunnel....

--- 帖子 #277 ---
how you manage backtests on such a system? could somebody teach me how to do this. i am quite new with metatrader and would like to backtest this system on a 15 M and Daily timeframe. tnx for any suggestions

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Sounds like a funny EA. Do you mind to share?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
No, I did backtest it using a trading simulator, manually Look for LFH trading simulator. I will search it and I will attach. It is better than vHands, because it allows opening multiple lots and closing one by one.That's my entry lots strategy.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
My trades during london so far: http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/...326/sofaar.gif Had a huge candle form to hit my stop loss on the U/J trade. It was not produced by news which was the wierd thing. Since then the market has been pretty wierd IMO. I might end up staying out until New York comes. PS; rarely do I get perfect entries with this system. Normally it is after the trend has formed and an entry on a retracement on 15m chart. Most of the time I am going for less pips and a quick move in my favor. I did have a chance last night to get a 50 pip move on a heavy E/U trade but I was safe and took profits. I'm sure eventually I will have a trade that gets into enough profit fast enough to set a trailing stop and let it run.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Ever seen a real long piece of string? THAT big.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Anybody in the UsdChf trade right now? Any thoughts on wether i should hold the trade above the Daily R2 point? Or is it wise to take the small profit just above the r2 once its broken and leave? Its my first live trade today, so happy that its turned out to be a winner so far. By the way Ken....when i use WaterFlames 10 sma template with your indicator, it seems to give too many cross over signals, any way we can get it to work without the 10 sma coming in the way? Just wondering Thanks guys!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
When the market is choppy, you cannot make anything but 10-20 pips but when a trend is formed you can always re-enter a position when the price retraces to 34 EMA (it must be correlated with a 0, 50 or 100 bounce from the CCi, and a "come back" move of the faster CCi (14) into the 34 CCi zone, also the 34 overlayed EMA crossed by CCi, etc....

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Another exit strategy to consider. I jumped on this eurchf trade a couple of hours ago. When I had about 41 pips from it I'd gotten a "critical level alert" from my cci indicator. I jumped out of the trade, the price moved about 8 or 9 pips higher and then dropped back quickly making the nice pin bar you see on the chart. Anyhow, it seemed to work pretty well. If you want to pay attention to that alert (critical level) just leave the indicator at the default setting of 250. EDIT: SORRY, I should have said that the critical level alert came in on the 15 min. chart. THAT makes a big difference! The price might still move higher, don't know. Just wanted to bank my friggin' pips!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Don't know, bro. I just started putting the 10 on my charts a little while ago. I haven't had the issue yet but I'll look for it and see if we can do something about it. ken

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi WF, If you read any thread on FF you will find a person, like yourself, who comes to the thread with an idea that is working. The thread catches a few traders and before you know it....10-15 indicators!!!! Traders...this is a wonderfully simple trading style. Will you catch the absolute top and bottom...no you won't. You will lose trying to catch tops and bottoms. The best traders in the world will catch the meat of the trade. Watch the trend on higher time frames and apply this nice simple methodology and you will pip everyday. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
...

--- 帖子 #294 ---
i will take a look at the critical alert good job Ken

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I agree-Another great benefit is to add the pivot points. They are widely used and will help you with both entries and exits!!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
is there allready any entry signal alert script that works?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
today i woke up too late ( sorry ) , after having a sight at asian session ( a too lazy market ) i told myself to not to trade in this conditions, and waiting for european session what i missed. All good moves are already runing, i will see if there will be the evening something to do.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I need to change my sleeping patterns and trade the London session. Each morning I review the charts and that is where the action is. With this simple alerting elitist system, you really only need to work it a few hours and you're in the money with very little effort. Last night was another example.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Sorry, Waterflame, but I did not keep the statement But it will be another soon, as I do backtest every single pair for exercise my eye with this system. I will post as soon as I will have it. I think an EA it will be simple enough to make since the system is so simple! But I did not have the necessary skills....

--- 帖子 #300 ---
EA will bomb -too many variables-Pinheads (not dragosd1) always come into these threads and see something good and they are going to make an EA and save the free world. Never happens!

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Golferfx - you are absolutely right. The main attraction to this strategy is that it has NO additional indicators and Waterflame has warned a couple of times that anything else added on will take away from the simplicity and effectiveness of this wonderful system. Unfortunately, people don't listen, so some will always come in and add on Fib retracements, Bollinger Bands, S &amp; R lines, or whatever, touting what wonderful indicators they have just discovered &amp; used on a demo account for a week or so and eventually screw up the whole thing. This is the path that EVERY system I've seen in the FF has suffered. Eventually, you wind up with 300 pages, the original author/contributor has given up in disgust and is never heard from again. Simplicity IS the key to winning in forex. It's a sad fact that most traders lose their accounts before they learn to lose all the 'indicators' which all just show you the same information - what the market did in the past. KEEP IT SIMPLE FOLKS! NOTHING IS NEEDED TO BE ADDED ON HERE!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Good point Flamenco! I do like the pivot points.. Here is a good example where the GU came right up and kissed the pivot ( blue) and dropped 70 pips. It gave an exit from a long and a short entry if you were so inclined.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Absolutely agree Summitfx....everyone thinks they can make a black box...its all about the trend...price action and wheres the support and where is the resistance. I do feel pivots can be added to WF's method. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
After healthy markets like this, it will surely slow down a bit, to breath again, and giving new explosive waves to ride, but difference between , healthy and sick. Evening will have maybe some good scalps after new entries. No entry for the moment. http://www.abload.de/img/healthymarketgy9.gif

By the way Ken, Your crossover alert works fine with the 10SMA added into my charts, one of my pairs was being a bit gay earlier on so it looked like things were messed up. made some pips on the UsdChf, my first live trade ever and it went a success. Thanks waterflame! ANybody else thats using Kens crossover indi along with the 10 SMA added...Does anybody notice that signals seem to be more accurate and trades seem to be better when the 10 SMA follows the 3 sma, particularly when the 3 crosses the 34, and if the 10 sma crosses around that time, the signal seems to be better? Seem to notice this happening on all my charts. Can someone confirm if im hallucinating and tripping or does this observation seem to hold any water? Thanks

Waterflame, Is your analysis of this pair, due to the slight angle of the cross. My confidence level wasn't that high for me to buy it

--- 帖子 #323 ---
i will explain all later, but watch the charts and get your own ideas first, that you can compare

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Is anyone trading on the higher TF, like 1-hr. If so how is it going.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi Mitch, Yes, and you should be using longer term TF's to see what the overall trend is and where the big support and resistance area's are with your fibs. With waterflames ma's and cci on the 1 hr and keeping an eye on the 200 sma...I prefer ema, you will see alot of activity around these area's...also 4 hr chart is good with this but your stops will be large. I look at the 4hr..then the 1 hr...and then trade the 15 with the swings. WF has a nice simple but effective set up here! Keep the excessive indi's off and watch price action! my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Best ragards to the author of this beautifull simple system. today i just watched the market with your system, and was a very good day to trade with your crosses. h1 is good to trade as well, signal is stronger no doubt but m15 is alright as well if you know how to manage it. cheers!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I agree with you on the people can't help there self to add indicators.That is human nature though.MAKE IT BETTER,MORE EFFICIENT,IMPROVE IT.GOGOGOGOGOGOG.But with forex, it is the opposite I think.Price action is very simple if you look at it correctly.It goes up and it comes down,that is it!We tend to make it more complicated then that.The more questions you take in regards of a trade the worst off you are.Because you will find that the answers usaully contradict themselfs.At least that is how I am starting to observe this market.KEEP IT SIMPLE!!!What waterflame has here is very simple.

Does anyone know of an indicator I can get for MT4 to show the remaining time of a candle?

Thanks for the indicator belekas!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Well I should have not traded yesterday at all based on the rules. The market had some huge moves that were technical moves not related to news. When that happened, It should have been my final clue to just stay away and get out with +5 pips. I ended up trying a couple more trades and for the day I am down -31 pips. No big deal, it was a learning experience. One thing I am happy about is I am getting better at setting smaller stop losses and sticking to them. Before as a new trader I would move my stop loss hoping it would turn around for me. It rarely did. Hey Flame based on what you saw yesterday would you consider the market to be "sick". Here are my final results...

I've been here for awhile and seen hundreds of threads come and go. Three things ruin threads that start with decent systems: 1. The filter bunch moves in and adds indicators and rules until the system is rendered extinct. I see this being attempted on this thread but the author is doing a good job of trying to keep it pure. 2. EAs. Someone programs an EA. The thread degenerates into a discussion of why it wont work and a continuous flow of modified versions. I haven't seen that here, yet. 2. The thread turns into a running chat room. There may be 200 pages of thread and only 10 posts that have basic information about the system. It makes it impossible for someone just coming in to learn anything about the method. There is too much junk to wade through. That's what will happen this thread...IMO. It's already started.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I'm not sure you can control that or even want to. It's probably up to each reader to wade thru the posts and decide whether or not to comment. If no one comments we wouldn't make any progress. It's the nature of the beast. On the flip side, i think it's amazing that people from all over the globe come together to share ideas. It's a first. I'm just glad it's in English. Makes you wonder why we fight wars. We should all come together here to solve our differences.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
that's Billbss humble opinion - his glass half empty and /or empty all depends on system and author - if both are good - all mentioned above -just one side of the coin - positive sides (not mentioned above) far overwelms negative p.s. cci filter, dots (on/off) - if needed to see cci values on wiggly lines

--- 帖子 #339 ---
and give serious consideration to what he says. My money's on the probabilities he's been trading a lot longer than you have, and he has some pretty high powered traders that acknowledge his skills and abilities trading the forex. That's not my humble opinion, that's fact.

Hi Brainjt, That Pivot indicator looks like a useful one for MetaTrader, the ones that I have are not accurate in my opinion, but I concurr with the pivots you have suggested, and that is just from a visual inspection of the charts. If you could share that indicator, I would be grateful. Thanks.

this is a 1H timeframe if you would go long, and it revers, it already have hit my stop loss of the advertising candles low ( bigger timeframes are not to play with, they will eat you ) be hard at the stop loss rules. as i told you, its not a good idea to trade signals in this condition back and forward, choose another pair and wait for entry, until this one have calm down.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
so what timeframe should i trade as a beginner? didn´t you say as longer the timeframe as less fakes there will be?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Yes bigger time frames have less fakes, you showed me one of the situations where fakes can appear, i answered with where your stop loss is, and to not re-enter a position in this market conditions, wait for something healthy and the time frame is your choice ( i recommand to demo almost the 15 min, because its very active, and you can learn much more from it, how, why and what to do in different situations )

--- 帖子 #360 ---
ok, just a example of a current running trade, what entry point would have been a good for me and where should i have placed the stop-loss ( i am here to learn xD ) i switched to M15 for this chart screenshot but i actually triggered this trade at 1H chart. http://www.chixpoint.com/images/m15.jpg

Trading today sucks. Nothing happening during asia then just like last night crazy moves all through London.

Hi li0uid, I would demo the 15 minute charts and get a good solid feel for 1 or 2 pairs and become their best friend. Know everything about them and how they react to s/r and the fibs. Keep an eye on the daily or 4 hr for the bigger picture but learn to trust yourself on the 15. Just my humble 2 cents.

Hello WaterFlame This is my first post in this forum I'm newbie on the forex 6 months I try to learn it I have a live account but it loose I try to looking for a simple system I have time and I can stay in front my pc so for me what' your propose 1H or 15M timeframe ? and trade always after the News ? I'm happy to follow this forum the members are pro and I learn to much excuse my english I'm french A+

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Pour les debutants, il est important de etudier tout ce que tu peut trouver, la faculté de plusieurs ressources est tres importante, ce system peut simplifier la tache techniquement, mais il faut aussi avoir une experience d'autre maniere de l'approche au marché, et a partir de la faire une comparaison a ce que j'offre ici, et commencer a progresser. Je recommande de regarder les 15 min, par ce que quand tu commence a faire de l'argent, ca va etre dans ce espace de temps. Et si tu ne sait pas interpreter les valeurs fundamentale des News, et si tu n'est pas un News trader, ne trade jamais des evenements pareille.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Je te remercie pour tes conseils depuis 6 mois je passe 8, 10 heures par jour pour essayer de comprendre le marché ... mais justement à force d'essayer des techniques je me rends compte que je n'arrive pas à me discipliner je sais aussi que l'on apprends pas ce boulot en six mois c'est pourquoi maintenant je souhaiterais avoir 2 stratégies simples et acquérir cette discipline qui me fait défaut je fais beaucoup d'erreurs sur des émotions que penses tu de mon entrée ?

Hi Waterflame and all, I have been "trading" for nearly two years now, but never really got started. I pretty sure my head is ready to go now and my account has been for 2 years! Your System looks very straight forward which is important to me. Should I look at the original set up or is it best to look at the updates from GolferFX as well? Also, could anyone tell me which software/charts they use? Mine are quite expensive. Cheers Fernie

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi Fernie, First and most importantly...this is WF's thread...I'm just a humble trader who has been around and felt that WF's methodology is a pretty nice simple style of trading FX. Not too much bullshit and not too many indicators...which for anyone new to trading is the key. I'm just into price action via what my charts tell me. The question of charting software you should be able to choose from a milllion brokers who provide meta trader 4 and all the indi's are right on this thread. Of course the experience and years of reading/studying/failing are up to you. Good luck and dont be afraid to ditect questions to any of the good traders on this thread. Just my humble 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Before trading this system ( as simple it is ), knowledge is a must ( in every job to master ). This system facilite the task conditions ( not initial trading ) The system was made for experienced and average traders ( in case they have abilities of ) Ressources for newcomers to learn : - Support Resistance, TrendLines and Patterns when trading in what ever a timeframe, draw major and current area S/R trendlines and patterns you will trade - Fibonacci Rectracement , Extensions if they fit , you can know major S/R and targets - Pivot levels helps for greater targets Market Moods : this ressources above will explain you conditions of the market moods ( see also news events ) Candlestick information: Candlesticks explain pressures of the actual price ( i don't use candlestick formation patterns) As i said you will not need them, says not to not know them Knowing this technics and forgeting them become a subconscient motor of trading understanding. Just looking at charts and seeing without analysing them will be your force. Its possible to trade this system without all this because in was constructed to be effective in great moves, in fakes it will get you some few pips, but not more as 2 or 3% of your profits ( if you follow the rules ) Learn this for the begining and trade the system demo, with time you will get a feeling for it, and be succesful.[/

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Please read the thread entirely before asking, almost all question were answered, and im not able to answer repetitively all questions from the begining, read the rules, most of questions and new questions will be added for explains and definitions. thank you excuse when somethings are not realy good explained, my english is not so good, but i try to give all

--- 帖子 #377 ---
this will be explained step by step Reading news time ( if im not a news trader, to avoid news events ) 1 - Setting up charts 2 - Drawing Support Resistance ( of previous and current area ) 3 - Drawing Trendlines ( of previous and current area ) 4 - Drawing Fibs 5 - Identifying Market Mood 6 - Looking for an advertising Candle 7 - Observating confirmation Candle 8 - Using the System with rules thats how i proceed

5. Leave your bias at the door and go with the charts. It took me a long time to learn this.. Trade what you see and not what you think. Thanks again WF for the time you put in here. ps: candlestix formations are fairly predictable

instead of using the 3 ema, why not make it simpler and just use price + 34 sma instead? A lot of pros trade with just one ma

The vouching system that you refer to here is an absolute JOKE. It's a good ol' boys club gone awry. 99.9% of these jokers have never met each other and they are vouching that they have completed over 1000 trades. I'm not speaking specifically about billbss. He seems to be very knowledgeable. I do, however, question the purpose of his post since he has not contributed anything. Then again who really cares~why I am even writing this- boredom? most likely

--- 帖子 #384 ---
yes , but i use candle information of price action, its my way to interpret them. i do not say not to use them thanks summit

--- 帖子 #385 ---
This chart of the EU speaks volumes about WF's simple rules. If followed, to the letter- there several decent trades here and several that would not have been entered. I get asked a lot by family and friends about trading and this simple little system is probably a great starting point for someone wanting to learn.

Hi Flame! Thanks so much for sharing the ELITE Trading System! This is a terrific blessing! I saw your recent post displaying a screenshot with 6 currency pairs. The EUR/CHF and GBP/JPY were deleted from the original group of 4 pairs to trade. EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, GBP/USD and USD/CHF have all been added. My question is do we continue to trade the original 4 pairs or do we adopt the new 6 pairs that appeared on your screenshot? Also, in the lower right quadrant of the main pane, you have several timeframe references. Is there a way to activate the time so that it is useful? Mine are static and of no use. If we cannot activate the timeframes, how can I delete them and remove them from the screen? Keep up the GREAT work! Bob in Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #389 ---
i change the pairs from time to time, i take a look on them and choose what would worth to be traded I recommanded low spread pairs what moves in good waves when the market is healthy, most of them you can see in the examples It depends also on you to choose the pairs what fits you

--- 帖子 #390 ---
what would be your call on always having a hard stop?I want to keep this sytem as close to mechanical as possible.I tend to think to much when I trade.I got into the eur/jyp,a couple hours ago.It was a sick market again or maybe you would call it lazy.I held onto it for about an hour then relized it was going nowhere and got out with 2+ pips.Did you take that trade?Thanks again for your help.

Trades http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/...ood-energy.gif One thing I have noticed while trading this system during "healthy" market conditions is a lot of the time when the 15m, 30m, and 1h charts all have the cross down or cross up happening at the same time the chances that the trade will go in my favor go way up. I use the 50ema -100sma -200ema, fibopivot.mq4, fibonnacci and trend lines for my support and resistance levels. When I want to analyze a bit further I look at the angle of my Stochastics, Momentum, and CCI to determine the strength of a possible move up or down and sometimes I will increase my lot size If it is a really strong move. The other day I mentioned that I was up 4 pips for the day, but because I had risked a bigger lot size on the winning trades and a smaller lot size on the loser I was actually much better off in monetary terms. I also mentioned a professional trade call another trader made who I followed that had a huge drawdown with 2 mini lots + spread(8) x2 = -16 + -220 pip loss = -$456. which blew out my awesome day on Monday. We were going for 600 pips so the risk/reward ratio was good. Anyways this trade had nothing to do with this system. I wanted to clarify so people are not confused. Overall with this system over the last 4 days I am way up, and because of my horrible loss the other day I will no longer follow anyone else’s stop loss suggestion. I will also not do too many long term trades since they play with my head while I watch them go huge negative for days. My maximum stop loss on any trade now will be 40 pips. When I go into a trade heavy I set a tighter stop loss to protect myself. My new money management method is based on my stop loss and not on % of my account. I am a pretty new trader so I am open to other suggestions on what you guys do to increase your profitability. Hope this helps someone. -Kevin One more thing... Often times when I get into 20 pips profit I will exit part of my trade and set a stop loss @ break even or with a 15-20 trailing stop and let it run.

EA doesn't have anything in common with the "feel" of the market. So I don't agree with EA's. It was only manual trading on 1h tf. I make even shorter tf, like 15 min, but tose require more attention and a lot of time....to stay at the pc. Right now entries on 4h tf are something like 1040 pips up, there was made on 1.04.2008. Regarding sl, you always have to adjust it based on the tf, pair and market mood. If you made the right entry (based on the signal and market mood) you can go with as 40 pip sl even on the 4h tf (which is a really tight sl for 4h), and ALWAYS move your sl (at least to breakeven) when the market goes in your favour (based on the same criterias), even if is hit, you will always have another re-entry. My main objective when I open a position, as a MM, is first NOT TO LOSE or cut losses short, so the protection of the account, and second HOW MUCH TO WIN. I also use a multiple lot entry, 5 lots, as you can see, and close them one by one at fibo levels of 34 EMA (as in vegas system). I always let 1 or 2 lots run and follow them with a sl or trailing stop, until they are hit (last profit target is something like 610 pips or 987 pips), or until market give me signs of reversal). Always you will have a new opportunity to re enter a position, so do not worry. And be aware of the TREND. I do made entry in countertrend but my sl is really tight (something like half usual sl), and I took early profit at lower levels, like 30-50 pips, then move sl to BE, and let 1 or 2 lots run, if the move is greater, then I will took a good piece of it!

Don't wanna be that glass is half empty guy, but you did see that it was a 43,79% modelling quality, right? It might be a really good EA, but we need to increase that modelling quality to test it further.

Man, as I said, is a manual backtest I know about the mod quality, that's the best MT4 can give, but it was made manually, so it does not matter the modelling quality!

Hi Folks ! I follow this thread with lots of interest Waterflame has introduced a method which I'm using for appr. 2 years. When I started trading Forex in 2004 I had a big learning curve regarding money management and "finding the holy grail". I made the same mistakes as the folks here at FF. The most important lesson I learned was to throw away all indicators and learn to trade only by watching price action. This was the foundation. In 2006 I met an experienced trader from London during my summer holidays in Italy. He was only using CCI and one Moving average..... He traded by identifying divergence and support / resistance and trendline breaks with Fibonacci (mostly the 50% level as target). The main key is to know there the bank stops are placed....... The daily game of the pros is to drive the price to special support zones, there a lot of stops are residing. If a company wants to place a huge order in the market they give their order to Deutsche, Citi, Lehman etc. What's happening then ??? I don't know but the trader guy told me that the huge returns the big houses made year in and year out are the result of communication So what can we do ? 1. We use Waterflames great system ! 2. You can make easy 20 Pips per day with it. (Thats 200 US$/day with 1 standard lot) 3. Only risk max. 3% of your account in one trade. 4. When you compound this the road to success will be finished soon !! Nothing more to say... Happy trading Bernhard

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi Folks ! With reference to my last post I've attached a compounding table. By assuming a starting capital of 1000 US$ and an average gain of 1% per day (Which is acheivable with Waterflames system) the return grows to 1.000.000 US$ in 3 years ! Some of you may laugh about this stupid table but this table is pinned on the wall next to my PC ! For me its only a motivation guide; you don't have to put pressure on yourself for winning every day ! I only want to remember you guys that you must have a dream and a plan to reach this goal ! And with DISCIPLINE and PATIENCE its ACHIEVABLE !!! Happy trading Bernhard

I asked Karim to send you the message in French. -Kevin http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/30/148326/rest.gif I entered 2 trades right before the news on purpose knowing it was big news and would move the market substantially. A sell on the E/U and a buy on the E/U. I just wanted to explain so you know why I broke the rules. I figured with the E/U I would only have to eat up 4 pips after I closed the losing trade and if the move was strong enough the good trade would keep going into profit. I risked the minimum amount I can with my broker, and made 8 pips. It was kind of fun experimenting, but everyone says to not hedge. Besides my experiment the other trades were using this system.

Several years ago, I worked for a charting company and we spent many hours at the largest Retail FX broker setting up our software for them to use with their subscribers. During the course of events, we learned about the dirty secrets of the business. The Banks that execute your trades have very sophisticated software that allows them to do exactly what you state here.They are able to aggregate all of the orders and see the stops and they are very predictable and obvious!!! Also, this broker had a locked room that was very secretive that they were very proud of. I understand they now offer "no dealing desk" platforms. It seems to me that this game of stealing your money has been to passed to the Banks. The dealers don't want to get caught doing this! The key to making money, I think ,is to trade without stop losses-it's your only enemy in this game. Since the markets vacillate around the pivot points, you need to trade smaller lots and make a little on every trade. There are some people doing this on FF. Steviet is doing this successfully-search him out and read! good luck~

I don't think they go after scalpers. They are looking at tens of thousands of orders- Big Picture They are managing their business just as anyone would but they do have an unfair advantage when you think about it.

Folks, i wanna tell you something. I have an example of some life trading with friends. When we enter a position by signal, they become anxious, omg is falling, omg its rising, it do not depends on that if you follow the rules, you know that even if you loose some pips, a good entry will recover all your losses and gives you profit. There is NO ever perfect system, this system make you earning more than you loose! After researching yourself, and having understand by reason that something is able of success, why are you cheating yourself. When i say "discipline" it don't will mean to force you to do something, it have to become an essance of your own understanding and action. Inhibition comes from ignoring something what assure you, and make you fear becaus eyou are not aware of it. This is a right feeling of human emotions, mercy of your EQ. But why returning to your old reasons when you have understand and advance to a better level of consciousness... Be confident, have self esteem, use your intelligence to resume and get a result, and in fact, even if you are failing, this failings are just a progression of coming forward. One of the traders here have a quote ( i don't remember who ) that he knows thousend ways to fail, and discover only one to succeed. your own conditions of thinking are very important, if you even have difficults to follow a system easy like this

Hi, Attached is an Alert indicator for a future MA crossing. You have to configure the fast and slow MA Periods (default 3 &amp; 34), the method of them (default EMA &amp; SMA, respectively), how many pips before crossing you want it to Alert (default 10 pips) and how many pips apart you want to re-enable the alert (default 20 pips), because once it alerts it won´t do it again to avoid multiple alerts because of 1 pip swings. hope it helps. You can use it when you are waiting for the 3/34 cross to enter and then, when in profit, you can change it to the 3/10 cross to exit. It will alert you when the price is within 10 pips (or whatever you set) to a MA cross to happen, so you can be there and act if needed. The line shows where the price has to go in the current bar to cause a MA cross, so it is recalculated every new bar. Regards, Mariano

Headfakes http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/...6/headfake.gif I just wanted to post some examples of headfakes I was able to spot. Normally these setup look like great entries to me, but my stochastics were giving me mixed signals so I stayed away. The one chart that did give me a good buy signal was the U/J trade and if I had the patience to stick with the trade it would have gone into profit 90 minutes later. One other rule I use lightly when thinking about entering a trade is I want the size of the candles to be at a minimum 2x (preferably 3x) the size of my spread. This is also one of the ways I gauge a lazy market. If the candles forming are less than 2x my spread from top wick to bottom wick I will not enter a trade. I figure if the previous candles are big enough the market has enough volume/volitility to get me in and out of a trade with positive pips quickly. Anyone else have any rules they follow loosely like this? PS: The missing candles in the U/J chart are Doji's that for some reason don't show on my black background.

Hi Waterflame, Thanks for the simple system. Love the simplicity and yet its making more pips then losing them. Do you mind to tell me what broker do you use? Since you're making money and I guess that you have made a lot of withdrawals from your broker, at least I'd know that your broker is reliable. I am asking this is because I am a newbie and I would'nt want to risk putting my hard earn cash into a broker who couldn't pay when you're winning. Currently I am with IBFX, and I'm only using a minimal amount to test with. Since your system works great, I'd like to put all of my available fund into a reliable broker. Thanks for sharing!

Thanks Water Flame

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Dave, you are correct. It always happens, it's human nature to take a perfectly good system and turn it into a FUBAR. So far the Author is reluctant to change anything and I applaud him for keeping it simple. Waterflame, congratulations on producing an excellent system, and having the patience to answer all the questions. I have run this system alongside my own, and I can tell you that what you are trading here, and what makes it quite powerful, is the fact that you have discovered the second most important "Pressure Point" of the six that exist in the market. In my library I have a book called " The Day Traders Advantage" by Howard Abell. About 18 pages are devoted to an interview with the legendary traded Bill Williams Ph.D. ( Chaos, fractals, MFI,and any ammount of Indicators). To cut a long story short, Bill Williams believes that the markets are five dimensional, and after two years of research and developement, I would have to agree. Three of the dimensions are constantly on the move, and cross each other all the time. When they cross each other it produces a pressure point, and the market reacts accordingly. The forth dimension is static, and provides an axis for the first three to revolve around. You can think of the zero line on your CCI as the Axis. When the first three mentioned dimensions cross this Axis, their actions produce another three pressure points. This is what you are trading , a dimension as it crosses the Axis. It's a definate edge, I recommend it. Good Trading. Roy

Hey Karim, I am going to continue updating my thread with charts and trades so I don't confuse anyone here.

[quote=fxxx;1936769] Yesterday i had a debate with a very aggresive , scynic, and pessimitic guy about moving average crossings, price behaviour and some other things. I will clearify that i haven't said ( read the thread ) that everythig is perfect. But the combination will help you to understand and succeed. every indicator " even moving averages " are lagging indicators. - Using alone moving averages will fake you - Using only price action will fake you too ( without talking about the other indicators ) That why are set the rules Combining Price action confirmation of the candles, with indictor signals to avoif mistakes, preluding entries, and protecting you with a low stop loss. Potentiality was showed of the Concept. here is a comparing to trade with the 3 Ema what is near to price but not sloppy, and not too far from price to give late entry. This will be the big difference, because most traders, even experienced, will have sometimes false analysing of market move consitions, and fall in this little traps. Thats for are this values and the concept made. See example: http://www.abload.de/img/fakes5we.gif

WaterFlame, hi. Been watching your thread since its birth. Fantastic thankyou! I too believe in simplicity. I have watched a few posters adding their tweeks to better the entries/exits. Some for the better and some not so. As with many strategies they have their fare share of false signals. I normally trade with Auslanco 15 min strat. One of the indicators used is the stop and reverse, which I think was custom designed especially. I placed it over your template and found it does seem to weed out the headfakes (as someone named) and can confirm continuation. Maybe worth a look for yourself and others. Haven't backtested it extensively yet but it has confirmed some good entries for me. Again I believe in simplicity. See pic for details. Will follow with interest. Merci beaucoup. Damo. P.S For those interested change settings: ATR Periods = 28 :ATR Multiplier = 2.75 All thanks must go to Auslanco.....

Simplicity is different to different people. It's all relative. In my opinion, this is a relatively simple system. Thanks for sharing.

Hello waterflame, I also thank you for demonstrate your system. I'm from Germany and follow your thread since the beginning. I started tests with different pairs (but only for a short time of 1 month). It seems to me that the success of your system depends on the volatility of the traded pair. If the volatility of a pair is not very high (like usd/chf) and it consolidates too often (as you described in #1 for Eur/CHF) around der 34MA, you get more losses than winners (often you reach not even the level for setting the 10 pips SL). So it happens, that you can get a row of wrong signals. It seems to me that it's better to trade only very volatile pairs. Can you confirm this with you long life experience and if yes, how do you respond to this? Best wishes, Erik

Hi Guys Just wondered if any of the more experianced traders would have time to comment on my trade pls? WF, Golfer etc. - Thanks Can't post pictures yet, but entered a buy on GBP/USD at 1.9885 at 12.54PM UK Time, stop loss at 1.9867. As price went in my favour moved stop loss to breakeven at 13.31pm and was stopped out at 13.45pm. Would be greatful for comments on... 1) Was this a valid trade? 2) Was it managed correctly 3) I could have taken around 20-25 pips, but thought I should let it run until I had a signal or stopped? 4) Was I a victim of the 199.00 phsycological level? I must say that for someone who has been quite a nervous trader I was v happy with the trade and always felt in control. Even though 0 pips I am happy with my first Elite trade. Will keep everyone posted. I understand that managing trades will ultimately be down to me, but would be interested in general feedback please to ensure I am on the right track.

Hi Fernie, A long as you pull the trigger and manage your s/l you are doing great....I would look at higher time frames to get a visual of the trend....on the 1 hr chart there was a 200 ema right on top of your trade and an S1 now acting as resistance. Also our 34 sma there too. GBP moves very quick...u might want to start with the eur/usd or chr/usd...not as wild swings within candles. Keep an eye on those overall trends...daily, 4hr and you'll do fine. golfer

Its not head &amp; shoulders.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
This is my understanding of an inverted head and shoulders on your chart. Maybe someone more experienced can correct me if I'm wrong. The normal head and shoulders would be the mirror image of this picture. I might be wrong about the take profit area on this cmfxmen. It might be enter on break to the upside and take profit on it's way up. I'll do some research and let you know what I find out. MY EXAMPLE BELOW IS INCORRECT.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
If you look well you can see that there is ALWAYS a not perfect "head and shoulder" forming, in everychart, in everytimeframe, it is the way the market move, somebody call it head and shoulder, somebody elliot wave pattern (a perfect H&amp;S would have the end of wave5 as HEAD, the point A as neck, B as second shoulder, and C as takeprofit area. and a not perfect H&amp;S (like that one on your chart) would have the end of wave5 as second shoulder, etc..), it is a good observation, but it's hard to understand what will be the "take profit area" of every of these non-perfect H&amp;S, anyway good observation

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I was wrong. It looks like the breakout is suppose to be to the upside breaking through the neckline. Check here fx: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/...dshoulders.asp -Kevin That example I gave above doesn't even have a defined neckline so it is a bad example. Check your inbox cmfxmen, I am sending you a .gif animation to watch with .mp3 audio file from a forex factory member I respect showing and explaining a good head and shoulders setup. Open the .gif and watch it while the .mp3 plays. If you open the files at the same time they should sinc up. It's my way of making a small file size with good quality picture like flash animation.

Waterflame, You use 10pip stop loss relative to entry, is it plus spread? Second you trail stop loss below or at SMA10 plus spread, correct? Did some testing which give loads of whipsaws especially after recent gains. Somewhat better after tank as shorts covers/create shortterm momentum

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hey guys. I wanted to share a sweet trade setup I just took on the E/J. I always look on multiple time frames to determine trends and support and resistance. With waterflame’s system I usually start by looking at the 4h to determine the strength of the overall trend. The 4h was a bullish trend and when I saw the 1h 34 CCI coming up through the zero line as well as the 30m 34 CCI coming through the zero line I knew it was a great trade. I got in the trade a little late but I targeted 15 pips which was just shy of the R1 you see on the chart. I ended up getting out early banking 11 pips. I went in light since I don't usually trade the E/J. Here are the charts: http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/30/148326/481h.gif You can also see the mandrake blocks all giving me a buy signal. Can you see how steep the CCI is? This is a great indication for the bullish trade. One last thing is I was above all the moving averages which is a good sign for the bulls.

Hi guys, nice to see you around... since friday ( the day i dont trade ) , after the NFP news , i didn't thought that realy something wanna move at asian open of sunday, so i missed the the first good entries, and had to wait until european session, yesterdays euro and us sessions were pretty sick lame consolidating, and even a bit dangerous for normal scalps. At the early begining of NZ open i tried to get warm having some pips, 3 - 34 crossing with candle confirmation breakouts just in the S/R range of geppy, my target was everytime 10 pips. In 4 trades i had 1 loss and loosing 10 pips by stop loss protection. At JP open we had some big spîkes at eur/usd eur/jpy and decided to continue just with gbp/jpy. My first good moves today for the begining of this week were at near european lunch. Well, sometimes we have to wait until the market gives us something. Me too i had this time late entries, but i got some luck. here a snapshot http://www.abload.de/img/roundqn5.gif

Hey belekas, I find them helpful, but I don't want to complicate WaterFlames simple system. I think you can get by without them just fine, but for me personally If I didn't use the blocks I would use momentum and stochastics as extra indicators. Just my personal preference. The downside to the blocks is they take up a good deal of cpu power on my old 2gHtz when I have 8 charts open and other programs running. I would advice any new traders to just use Waterflames system as it is without complicating anything. -Kevin

I use the 15m chart for my entry because it is easier to see the pullback/retrace. I usually just use my 4h, 1h, and 30m to confirm my entry and make sure I am not opening a trade at a major resistance level. For example the 4h and 1h charts the fibopivot, 100sma, 50ema, and 200ema are major support and resistance levels for me. 30m and 15m I just use the simple system as Waterflame describes it. Let me show you some possible bad trades when the 15m chart looks like a good trade.... 1sec. PS: you notice how the E/J never made it up to the R1. I got a good exit because I had little greed and saw the candle start to "dance". That is what I call it anyways. If you watch a candle sometimes it will "dance" up and down before a reversal or a big continuation.

Still very vixy (automated signals+sma10 cross). You need some sort of indicator filter for CCI.

Nice trading Waterflame, i missed those entries as i was away but then again the next opportunity is waiting all the time

--- 帖子 #529 ---
A bad trade in disguise. http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/30/148326/bad.gif This is how I use WaterFlames system. I have all my charts on the 15m timeframe. I always start by looking at the 15 min chart. What I look for is the cross of the moving averages and the 34CCI crossing the zero line. If the 15m chart looks like it is about to cross I go to my 4h chart. The green vertical line represents where I would have been looking to sell the P/J on the 15m chart. The 34sma is brown and the 3ema is gold. 1.) What I look at on my 4h chart is my trend and any major support and resistance areas. On the picture above you can see the fibopivot which is the brown lines and the gold line in the middle which is the daily pivot. On the 4h I don't pay much attention to the fibopivot unless one of my major moving averages is right on top of the daily pivot for example. What I look for is the trend which was a sideways trend. On 3-27-08 GBP/JPY it was neither bearish nor bullish. I look at the moving averages I have which are the 100sma, 50ema, and 200ema. If my current 4h candle is above the 100(green), 50(purple), and 200(yellow) moving averages it is a bullish sign. If my candle is below it is a bearish sign. What I see on the 4h chart does not really tell me anything except the fact that the overall trend is sideways. None of the information on the 4h chart helps me. Also keep in mind the 4h chart is the least important chart I look at IMO. 2.) What I look at on my 1h chart is any major support and resistance areas. Same thing with the fibopivot on my 1h chart. It is not very important to me unless I see another indicator like one of the moving averages resting right on one of the fibopivot levels. I look at the current candle and see that it is forming above all the moving averages and remember that this is a bullish sign. I am looking to sell the P/J on my 15m chart and because my 1h has a bullish sign I might think about taking smaller profits. If the 1h was a bearish sign I would be looking for 20-40 pips++ on the P/J normally. I use a 40 pip stop loss on the P/J always. I also note that the CCI is rather flat and at the +100 line which is neither good or bad but I would rather have it pointing sharply down and closing in on the zero line to reinforce my bear signal I have on my 15m. I don't give much weight to the mandrake blocks on the 1h and 4h charts, but I do note that they are both more bullish than bearish. Based on all the bullish signs I see on my 1h and 4h charts so far the trade still might be a good sell trade, but because of these signals I will go in with less lots and exit with less pips if I decide to take the trade.... onto the 30m chart. 3.) What I look at on my 30m chart is where the CCI is in relation to the zero line and the mandrake blocks. The CCI is angling slightly up and is close to the +100 line which is a bullish sign. The mandrake blocks are showing mixed signals. You can see that I do not have the extra moving averages on my 30m and 15m charts. They are not important to me on my 30m and 15m charts. If I did see a major support or resistance level near the current price on my 1h and 4h charts I would have drawn a horizontal line on the 4h and 1h charts that work on all timeframes so I would see these same lines on my 15 and 30 min charts as well. I can see nothing else that will help me on my 30m chart. 4.) What I look at on my 15m chart is : Has the 34sma crossed the 3ema?...Yes. Has the 34CCI crossed below the zero line?...Yes. Are the mandrake blocks all red?...Yes. These are my sell signals. The flat CCI on the 15m chart is a bad sign. Two candles before the candle where the 34sma crosses down over the 3ema signaling a possible sell I see a spinning top. Spinning tops reflect uncertainty in the market. This is a bad sign. The two things that make this trade look good are the steepness of the angle of the 34sma as it crosses the 3ema and the mandrake blocks all showing a sell signal. If the 34CCI broke the zero line with the same steep angle that the 34sma has I might take this sell, but because of all the other bullish indicators I would not take this trade...No way. Hope this helps -Kevin PS: Take these rules and apply them to the trade example of the E/J I put up and you will see why it was such a great setup for me. That trade the "stars were in alignment". Too bad it was for such a short run, and too bad I didn't go in heavier.

It is a lesson maid of training I am going to print and to translate into French thank a lot A+

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I may be wrong but it seems to me that the author of the system himself said that: "... neither trandlines, support resistance, HH LL, Fibs, complicated 7 different MA's at once Support Resistance conditions to analyze, Just one and only one signal for entry" and also: "...to watch different timeframes to get an entry is useless with this system, just take one time frame your account balance will allow you to trade for your risk management, and follow the system rules." What do we do with that? I'm personally still looking for a way to make a perfect entry. One good out of ten bad attempts just doesn't cut it for me. But you do have a point here. I'm still searching for a kind of filter to possibly rule out fake signals. Today I almost threw my notebook out the window; I buy, the price falls the moment I place the order, I sell - the price immediately goes up.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hey letoiny, wellcome to my world... and I think we are not alone I know that every trade goes that way at least momentarily. Can anybody explain how to know when it is a just-wait-a-moment,-it-will-go-your-way thing and when it is a real get-out-of-this-trade,-now!! ? regards

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hello letoiny me, I understood of the system it is the simplicity to return but there are rules 1: the feeling of the market? Ranging, trending 2: crossing of MA 34 with MA 3 3: CCI above or below of the line 0 synchronized with MA 4: the S/R more FIBO 5: the recognition of paterns and candles 6:trendlines and more I think system is simple but not simplistic A+

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Good observation of this system.I wonder if we need to look that far into it though?I have noticed with a lot of trades, price will turn against you and come right back to the prior candle before the ema's cross.Put your stop a couple of pips above that if that is how you are using your stoploss(some food for thought).

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hey letoiny, I really want to respect Waterflames thread by not hijacking it with a different system. In my wierd mind I figure I give this thread respect by explaining how I personally use the system to make profitable trades. I had considered putting these post up on my thread and linking to it but that didn't seem right. Trading is not an exact science. You can have 100 people following the same system eactly and have only a small percentage of the 100 making the same winning trades as the creator of the system for any number of reasons. I know it took Flame more than just a couple minutes to come up with this system. I also know that trading any system you have to have basic knowledge of forex to make educated entries and educated exits. This is why 100 people will have different results with the same system. We all have learned to trade differently. I consider myself to be a beginner in trading since I have only been live for 2 months. In this time I have made over 450 live trades. I have 69% good trades and 31% bad trades. The problem is my bad trades are 2x-3x bigger losses than my average winning trades so my account balance is negative by a little. Most people lose all their money in forex so it is my goal to help spread what little knowledge I have gained to help others just like Flame has done. I agree that adding a bunch of extra indicators may be detrimental to the system as it was designed, but each trader needs to develope and trade in the way that suits them. I disagree, respectfully. A simple reason is this: If you trade against the trend all the time you will have more bad trades than if you trade with the trend. It's human nature to want to make something great, better. I'm not saying the way I trade is better, just saying I trade the way that suits me. I noticed cmfx having some bad trades and that is why I posted this. I will gladly remove it if Flame would like me to. -Kevin

--- 帖子 #536 ---
hi letoiny and masilva, to begin at all, i've neer said that trading would be easy, neither with this system, and i didn't told also that the system is for everyone, newcomers included. As i wrote that most technical analysis can become useless ( it doesn't mean to ignore them at all ) but most of the rules set identify for you the conditions. Example is to not to trade big candles, not to trade lazy markets, they reaveal for you a ranging area of support resistance, and allows you too, if in this area some good advertising and confirmation candles appear, you can scalp your ten pips out. The stop loss was explained again by the Advertising candle, hard stop would be the previous candle of the advertising candle. ( if realy 3 - 34 cross appears, you would be out ) Market moods were explained not for pleasure, because most of traders know that markets have a live cycle, from introducing to a lead in, than to maturity, resting and weakening. Healthy markets appear from the introducing of the strongness, and also in the weakening part of the cyclus ( we trade pairs, you can go long or short ) Maturity and resting becomes Sick an lazy markets, and it depends too of your tradig time, trading sessions, pairs you trade in time etc. The part of only trading one timeframe comes from... a trend begins from the 1 Min chart, and not the opposite, so if you wish to catch a good move, you need to be in from the begining, and not jmp in when it will maybe finish or rest. Thats why i trade mostly the 15 min to have a nice begining, and even if 1 H chart retrace, or consolidate, you have with CCI and the price action candles information scalp possibilities, you have the entry rules, and you have a good stop loss. Its about to follow the rules, discipline and practise, patience... I hope most of things are cleared Good evening

I do respect what you are sharing don't take my post the wrong way.I myself have been live for about 2 months and I have the same problem.I win more than I lose but when it comes to the losing trades they are much bigger than my winning trades.Maybe we are not letting are profits ride,that seems to be my problem.I have not yet used this system to let the hard stop hit.(the candle before the advertising candle,stop above or below it)I have went threw this sytem with a back test and it looks good.You will have a few losers but the winners really do make up for it.The only problem I have here is I have the asian session that is it.My sleep and job cut out the rest.By the way do you have the indicator for those blocks? goodtrading!!

Hi, guys, Thanks for your feedback and comments. Masilva, great to hear that I'm not alone. Reading this thread and looking at screenshots posted I was under impression that almost all the guys here were getting it right all the time. As for me, -it-will-go-your-way or get-out-of-this-trade,-now!! thing is more or less clear, the problem is I get hit with Wrong Way!!! thing most of the time, especially today. cmfxmen, thanks, I try my best to strictly follow these as well. Kevyluvu, don't get me wrong, I appreciate your sharing your views with other members. I do agree with some of your points, especially that one should always trade with the trend and I myself always check H4 before entering a trade. I simply referred to Waterflame's earlier remarks on the subject. Waterflame, thanks for your additional explanation and please don't remove the thread. We have so many guys sharing ideas and helping each other here. We need this thread and your support!

I sold a half lot at 1.9747 and closed it waaaayyyy early at 1.9743 - I had to take care of some business. When I came back, I saw that I should have set a TP at the daily pivot. or at a minimum the 61.8 fib. Oh well...+4 is better than anything negative. BTW, I only did a half lot because I trade this is on my live account.

Hi. I started reading this thread some ways back but could not participate because i had to leave town for a while. Now i'm back and . . . WAOW! Everything has changed!! What happened to the initial WF idea? Yea, i know; it's the fast-paced, ever-advancing world we live in, that's what. Now i feel like i just came in from the old stone age. Can someone please try to update me in a very brief summary what the latest improvements are, it's success rate compared to the classic system and of course, it's failure rate? Going back in time to read all the way to the present would really be tasking, plus, who knows? by the time i reach this point things would have gone into another age again? Thanks anybody.

Yes, we knew that would happen, as UK Interest Rates were cut to 0.25%, so it was a matter of time and finding a good entry and this found a good entry... this is where I think f**king banks or brokers... I was on demo and I took some trades, 2 when i thought they were going down, but did not use SL (as it was demo)... but you can see the issue here... a lot of people a selling with tight SL and they are being taken out by the brokers and banks, and then people might be moving the opposite direction, as soon as people move in the opposite direction, then the big boys know and then, smash... it drops

Read through all the main posts and been watching this week set ups and scrolling back in time as well. Very nice and simple trading system that gets in before the move is half done and exit before loosing half or even 2/3s of the move!! I am watching and hope to apply this during the 6pm to 1am New York (eastern time zone). Is anyone else actively trading to enter trades during these hours? If so, are you also in the chat room just posted above? I would be interested in an active trading chat room during this trading session time and wonder who else would be too. This is the only time i have available due to day job and sleep is required. T4L

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I have noticed that when trading this system that I have lost out mainly around resistance points, you have a cross of the 34 and the 3 and the cci is pointing in the right direction its all looking good you enter the trade only to find the price retrace soon after after you have entered the trade, you pull out at a loss. Often that the price will retrace back in your favour, has anyone any views on how to trade this situation? What would be the best method of getting a feel of which way the price is likely to go? I have tried hundreds of indicators every thing seems to lag the market Is there not a crystal ball method? LOL

--- 帖子 #593 ---
yes , sometimes it can happen that price reverse against you, and clearify a false signal, but before that, mostly gives the position you are in, at least 10, pips, so you have to choose between, scalping 10 pips, or setting stop loss to 1+. As i told in the thread above, it depends almost on the sessions to avoid this kind of markets, personally i will not trade the evening of us session, i explained already that the asian to european close sessions ca give good moves.

can I replace stoploss with hedge for your system? a filter to your system?

Was thinking about take profit situation.I like waterflames 10 ma strategy.I was lookingt at back charts and maybe it would be a good idea to open two positions and close the first one out at +10 pips,and set the second positions stoploss at breakeven.That way you are usually always going to get 10 pips out of the trade,but have the second position open to let it ride incase of a strong trend.Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
sounds great jlmac, it worth a try of money and risk management, and see how to fir it out with stop loss of the 2cnd lot, thanks for the idea, personaly i don't trade more just 1 lot, but this one is a good idea... keep writing

--- 帖子 #604 ---
jlmac27, you thoughts on 10pips for TP #1 is my thinking too! Then second position is moved to break even and closely watch and manage in case if the trend moves 20-50pips. For TP#2, there are many possibilities to exit. I am thinking of setting it at 20 or 30pips during the asian market. I think this benefit would or could possibly off set the losses in the long run. time will tell which one fits each of our personalities and allocated time to trading. Glad to hear you are interested in the tradingroom.com suggestion. T4L

Hi all, after observing the difficulties of some of the guys to find the right entry candle, taking entries at time or to avoid fake candles, i remembered a thread of a nice indicator, what changes color of the Candle by moving average set ups... MA1 = 3 Ema MA2 = 34 Sma You need to change the MA1_MODE to 1 = Ema You need to change the MA2_MODE to 0 = Sma you will find the indicator attached to this post that will mean whenever your moving average cross system will have an signal, you can configurate the Ma candle to the same numbers, and while crossing, the candle will change color. With it i guess you can take your entry candles better, i have test it out before posting it. The only advise i can give you, is to be patient until the Candle color change bellow is an example * No rules were changed, this indicator helps additionaly to define entry signal candles http://www.abload.de/img/candletx1.gif http://www.abload.de/img/geppy0t9.gif

Hi all, i researched another sweet tool what can you help for identifying the right candles for entry, if you still have problems to identify advertising and confirmation candles, with the Ma candle indicator. This one is much easier, you wait just for the apearing of the dot, and not changing color of any candle. I hope it helps you ... Regards http://www.abload.de/img/samplehln.gif

hello! have been following the charts in the asian markets now for two weeks! i see four good pairs to trade with the goal of having a TP of 10pips as a hard exit or can adjust stop loss and prices moves so its behind the last or 2nd to last candle's low/high. T he pair is gbpjpy for the above profit strategy. For the other 3 pairs, TP of 7pips for usdjpy, audjpy, and eurjpy. or can adjust stoploss as stated above. Entry is done on a 5min. chart, but before this, use the 15min chart to create the high and low for the asian session based the past 5-8 hours trading time before 5pm central time. For long, the price should be near the bottom and shorts should have price near the top. Seams entry times are ideal at 5pm - 8 m central time. only enter trades between hours of 5-8pm central time to avide some false entery before this time and miss the moves when entering after this time. This is just my thinking based on my observations. If you look at the gbpjpy and usdjpy on the 5min, its a great example of getting the 10pip and the may second lot is managed as it would continue to make 15, 20, 25, etc (but would close if hit 35 as a max for gbpjpy and 20 for usdjpy due to small typical ranges in asian session)

Hello Everyone, Excellent thread. thanks to all and especially to Waterflame for posting this method. I am manually testing this method and came across many situations where we get the signal and trend continues for more than 24 hours some times even 2 days and obviously it is difficult to monitor trade for 2 days, one of the post it was mentioned that when CCI crosses 100 again we can reenter the trade in the trend direction or take profit and wait for another signal. Is the any other way to reenter the trade instead of waiting for the reversal signal. I am posting a GBPUSD 15 min chart where i have marked the begening and end of the trend in Blue rectangle, trend started around 2/14/2008 18.30 GMT and ended 2/15/2008 23.00. I will appreciate any comments regarding this. Dennis.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
One option is to follow the trade for the first five to six hours. Once the initial profit is locked in, then set a trailing stop and enjoy the rest of the ride on the trend.

Apologize Babytrader, i just haven't the time the last days to answer, i will clearify it for you. No rules were changed, but just to watch at the 3 Ema, use the dots as a plus for entry, to be assured of the Confirmation candle, and entry signal. have fun

I know at the beginning there were 4 pairs suggested but I reckon by now people may have tried on on a few others. Are there any pairs it really seems to work particularly bad on, or vice versa? GBP/JPY seems to be the consensus pair for most movement.

Hello, could you try to explain what kind of market condition this chart says. I would like to understand if this was a good idea to start a trade long @ 1.5571 within confirming candle near 34 SMA advertising candle looked ok to me... market conditions looked fine to me too... out on stop 1.5561 stop was at the low of the confirming candle http://www.chixpoint.com/chart.jpg

gbpjpy looks like a great entry to long at 206.50 on 5min chart during the asian market now. the TP will be 206.68 - 2/3 of position. the 1/3 will adjust stop accordingly in case this moves near 206.85 to 207 range.

Waterflame, I like your system. My charts are set-up exactly like yours and I have read through all these posts a couple of times now and I understand the system. Question (?). I use constant range candles set at 7 or 9 depending on speed of market. I have found that I don't like full candles as they are unpredictable. Is it possible to use your system using range price bars? Everything else is the same, advertising candle then entry candle. The CCI with the histogram is a very nice indicator set at 34. Thanks snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #640 ---
you are welcome snarlyjack, yes sure you can use range price bars, personaly i choosed candlesticks to get an idea of price information, but if you know you are able to trade RPB's, go for it... take care of line charts, it gives only closed price to consider, price breaking of the SMA 34 can in this case almost result in fakes, thats why we are using candles.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Waterflame, Thanks for all your help! One last question. Do you use the trend M.A.'s in your system at all. For example, 50 sma, 100 sma, 200 sma or do you strictly use the 34 CCI and the 34 color price bars sma? I've found that I'am more of a short term scalper and I feel that I miss a lot of the moves when I just trade in the direction of the 100 sma for example. With your system I'am not sure we need the 50, 100 200 sma? Thought I'd ask your opinion. Thanks. snarlyjack

Hi Waterflame, first I want to thank you for that very good system and all the generous work, you put in this project. I tried your system first with a test-account and since 9 days with a real account and it performs good. In face of my exercises with the test-account I made some bugs like enter to early in the trade. But this is a question of discipline an can only be trained by doing. But I have still one problem: On #1 "How to enter with stoploss" you demonstrate the setting of the initial stop, but I could not find the place where you described your manner of setting a trailing stop. Do you move your TS (if you use one) on Breakeven with a fix roule or depends it from the situation? (Please excuse me, if you already described this somewhere in the thread). Best wishes, Erik

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Waterflame, I read your "holy grail of enlightenment" and enjoyed it. Thankyou! Question. What are the settings of the SMA your using to show support-resistance (crossover-sma)? It seems every system that I look at has different SMA settings. Ranging from 50, 89, 100 and 200. And I want to get the settings correct for the CCI 34 system. I trade a different market than most people here. I trade the mini-dow (ym market, $5.00 per point) short term. I have found with the ym market that you must be very accurate with your entry. You want the market to move in your direction right away or 3 or 4 points $20.00 against you and I'll sell out and reposition the trade. So...I'am trying to get very accurate with all my setting coordinated with one another. Thanks for all your help! snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #645 ---
hi morander, im very glad for you... for the trailing stop, i use 20 pips, giving the market enough space to retrace and breath. enjoy

--- 帖子 #646 ---
hello snarlyjack, excuse me to not answering you earlier... if you are not satisfied with the Fib levels, S/R targets, you can use the 89 SMA and the 233 SMA, to get targets, see rangings in stuck areas, and use them as S/R. , i have them myself too sometimes on charts if i dont realy know whats goin on in the market. i dont have much knowledge about the dow, ticks and pips are in value pretty different, and i can't estimate how you should use your risk management on it, but we have in our #Eliteforex channel on irc all kind of traders who use this system, with wh you can discute further about it... take care

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Thank you for the info, Waterflame. By the way, before I started trading with your system, I studied the also very interesting approach of Phil Nells 5min-Strategy ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=11854 ) He uses the 5min-retraces in a strong up- or downmove for jumping in a trade. It's remarkable, how this strategy can complement yours. Specially in cases of missing the right elite-entry or the elite-entry is to far away from the 34er. Then the trader can change to the 5min timelevel and look for a retrace-entry following the rules of Nells strategy.

i have marked a signal in the attached screenshot and was thinking that perhaps it was not a good entry point because of the large candle before it. Could someone please confirm this? The system feels very simple but i guess we need to get the hang of entering and exiting at the appropriate times. I have looked at past days and there seem to be signals which quickly change to new and opposite signals and I was also wondering if anyone has found a way to reduce the number of false positives in the signals. I know that sometimes losses happen but reducing fake signals or even being able to identify some of them will make this strategy even more profitable. Regards ...

--- 帖子 #656 ---
As I understand the system, the candle you have marked is the crossover point for the 3ema. The next candle would be your entry.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
And given the legs on the pair of them and the ranging market from open to your bar, I would wait.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
you have definitly all righ, stop loss at the top of the advertising candle, entry perfectly with the confirmation candle. The deal is just, as you mentioned, it was pretty sick before this entry, no smooth trending, it was ranging the candles up and down, giving big candles... and loo where your Stop loss is, you risk much . i wouldnt take this trade and wait for a good set up look at your image you postedn there was a sweet run 2 signals before. it depends too on your pair you trade, the timezone you trade the pair in good job rsharpe, avoid big candles for entry and stop loss

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Thanks Clansman, aud and Waterflame. I guess the important task now is to teach myself to identify the healthy, sick and lazy markets by looking at the charts. Looking at one of your charts in first post it seems like you also have re-entry points for this system. so if trend was up and does below 200(or 100) and then goes up again, you re-enter when it cross 200 (or 100)? Is this correct? Regards and thanks again for replying.

pls sir i know you have your own trade to do which am sure it will be taken your time too. but i just want to seek for this favour that you may pls be helping me or us with the news time which we should not trade (i mean for news novice like me) this awesome system. i mean those news time that we shoud hold on for even if our signals are sync out of the neews listed in FF. ust because like today before the london session opened i had the indicators well sync in eur/jpy but i had to wait because of that 2 early eur news (French CPI m/m, ECOFIN Meeting) which unfortunately for me did not affect the market. so pls may be you can help in this regard by listing the likely newstime we or i should avoid while using this signal. may be a day before the news. i guess you undertand my long story. thanks

Hi everybody ! I'm curious about your monitor when you look at Elite signals. How many pairs do you follow, how big is your monitor, how is your chart layout ?? I have a 17" monitor (notebook) but it's to small to check everything (4 pairs) so i follow only 8 chart showing only CCI in 15 min and 1h tf. When the CCI is crossing 0 then I open a bigger and more complete chart. What about you ?? Have a good trade. Bye. Montecristo.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Why dont you buy another monitor, and plug it in the laptop.. so you will have the ability to use 2 monitors (one of the laptop and one the other monitor), maybe u can buy a big CRT monitor (CRT monitors becomed soo cheap, so its really a little cost), and you will have the ability of monitor many charts, without spend too much

This is a very good trading method! for me, its hard to trade during london and US hours. in fact, its a shame i cant. i can only trade during asian session. when i look at the london and us times, all i can say is wish i could alter my schedules to be at a computer during those times! There is not a lot of questions or lack of direction needed for this method. its just a matter of the entry going to be a potential false signal before the good signal. Thats the only real question i find asking my self during the asian session. After the false signals, when the real signal comes it can be a big run! that should more than off set the false signals. at this point, traders using this method probably want to communicate with others using this method for added confirmation for entries and more so for exits. maybe.... IMO, i know i would like that. T4L

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Can i trade in day or must be in hour?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Try using a lower TF as a filter for entry. In my forward testing of this system, I have been experimenting with using the 5M as a filter for the 15M, and the 4H as a filter for the Daliy. Since trends start on the lower TF's and build up to the longer TF's, checking to see a solid trend is already in motion on a lower TF can help. I also use pivot points to help determine entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Clansman Thank you for your tips on time frames. Right now, i am watching / trading only during the asian markets using 5min chart for entry and exit. i look at 15m and 30m to help gauge and create an area of a range. based on what your saying, should i go down to a 2 or min chart to help find better entry and more importantly skip false signals? Another thing about your post, you mention daily and 4H charts too. do you apply this method to trade based daily chart? so that all your work is done after the close of the daily bar in the following 1-3 hours? I would be very interested in hearing yours and anyone else's comments or thoughts on using this to trade using the daily chart. It sure would make for a better fit to my life style. T4L

Thanks for the link . This is incredibly simple and so easy . I had some great trades this morning and I didnt have to think as much as I nornally do. Who wants to be thinking too much anyway.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
While I can't tell you what will work for you, if you are using the 5M TF to determine your entry then add the 2M charts and forward test the combination. If it works for your eyes and you are trading profitably then stay with it. If not, then try using the 15M or possibly the 10M in combination with the 5M. I set my charts up so that I have eight (8) charts (four (4) currency pairs) per screen. The four (4) charts on top are the higher TF (i.e. 15M) while the four (4) on the bottom are the lower TF (i.e. 5M.) Setting the charts this way allows me to scan the main chart (top chart) for the entry conditions and drop straight down to confirm the strength of the entry position. I use multiple monitors allowing me to watch eight (8) currency pairs at once. I have been forward testing this system on the Daily TF with the 4H as the support TF (see the attached charts.) When trading the Daily TF, an entry may not appear every day, however, the trades will usually run longer. The stops need to be set farther out as well. I hope this has been of some help.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Clansman sounds like you have a traders work station dream! nice job! i set up daily charts and 4H to begin my evaluation of 18 pairs to determine which ones provide potentially good daily or weekly moves. It will take some time to figure out TP or multiple TPs and stop loss so that it could be profitable. I did take a look at some pairs. there are runs that go 500 to 1000pips over the course of 1-4 weeks. Thinking this is needed to off set those false signals even if the 4H can void some false signals. After some evaluation, we should discuss ideas to take this method and apply it to a daily chart. That is if you are interested. I also invite anyone else to join in this challenge. T4L

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Thanks. I am using three 17" monitors. On the next system I build, I am seriously considering using 30" monitors (not only will I be able to have more charts up, but they can be larger as well.) Waterflame has combined two indicators with price action and created an excellent system. As traders, I believe we have an obligation to our bank accounts to analyze trading tools (whether it's a complete system or only a different TF than is normally used) to see if (and how) they might fit with our individual style of trading. With regards to the longer TF's, broker's tend not to start the day at midnight. My broker changes their Daily charts at 1700 E.T. This requires me to look at the 4H chart that starts at 1600 hours. However, unlike using the 5M to confirm entries on the 15M, using only the 4H charts to filter out false starts on the Daily does result in S/L's being hit. Recently, I have been using the Hourly and 15M charts to fine tune the entries on the Daily charts. As you can see, I accept your invitation and look forward to hearing yours (and other trader's) ideas on the Daily TF.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Waterflame, I hope you are ok with us discussing your method to apply this to daily charts in this thread. If you feel this should be a spin off of your method using a 15M method, please let me know and will you open a new thread designed for application on the daily chart (only!). Clansman, glad you accept this! I have a charting program that daily ends at 5pm eastern time. Also, the sunday candle is not just a 3 hour period either. I think this puts us on the same times for daily bars start and finish. This is an important detail duirng our investigation. Your idea of the 1H or 30M to aid in entry is good thinking. It may help to place entry somewhere within the range of the signal bar. Before i begin, I would like to mention or state the top line general goals. The goal is to make pips. How much is the quesiton without being greedy or a low winning percentage. I feel a weekly goal of 75-100pips and monthly 350-400pips is to be the goal. Its important to realistic and easier goals to acheive! During the evaluation, keep this in mind and ask ourselves what decisions or paths to take will it aid in acheiving the weekly/monthly pip goals. Thats the bottom line! The currency pairs! I reviwed 19 pairs and put them into three categories based on low end of possible daily pip ranges of 150+, 100+, ~70, and ~50. They are: 150+ GBPJPY, GBPAUD, and GBPCAD 100+ AUDJPY, GBPUSD, EURAUD, EURUSD, CADJPY, GBPCHF, EURJPY, USDCAD, and USDJPY ~70 NZDJPY, CHFJPY, USDCHF, and NZDUSD ~50 AUDUSD, AUDCAD, EURGBP, and EURCHF The typical day range will play a key roll on stop loss and TP exit(s). For TP, I am thinking of two exits: The first one will be a fixed amount with a high probability and will acheive the goals. For the 150+, TP to be 50pips plus spread. For 100+, TP to be 40pips. For ~70, TP to be 20pips. Then for the ~50, I am thinking drop those pairs or make TP 10pips. The second TP would be to adjust daily to break even and beyond over time. Also, use the method's exit strategy. This is where we would possibly capture 100-1,000pips over 1-12 weeks of a trend move. The stop loss is something i am not sure yet, but probably apply to the principle of this method. As a result, will have to start out with very small positions for $ management. I have glanced the daily charts for some of the above listed pairs. I think over the course of a year, there may be 5-20 signals per pair. If this is applied to 10 - 15 pairs, the main goals could be acheived with very few trades and making decisions to enter and adjustments at the start of a new candle. As for major news events, maybe exit day before and avoid entry the day before. Another way to avoide entry is the healthy, weak, and sick market waterflame adviced on needs to be applied to avoid false signals. Also, candle formations. If long entry is valid and see three long body bars, wait for a pullback. This is candle pattern may aid it entry placement. The 4H and 1H may also play a big roll in entry for reduced stop loss and/or acheive TP #1 sooner creating more winners of false or weak signals. That is where I am so far. Next steps is to scroll back over the last 5 years for each pair to see how far longs and shorts move in pips for each valid signal. This will help to gauge the first TP with a high probablity, aiming for 80%. I will publish the pair's stats. Once this is done, maybe start a general guideline for the daily chart trades. Then refine, adjust, and add the little details. Any thoughts so far or comments to add? T4L

CLANSMAN, I completed a 5 year back test starting 1/1/03 to april 2008. signals were mechanical based only on 3 cross 34 and cci cross 0 line. I calculated from entry bar draw down required to reach 60 and 80pips. Then draw down in order to reach 100 and 120 pips. Then i lookd for maximum move and number of bars (or trading days) the move would make before the 3 and 34 cross the other way AND price would have to go below the low of the signal bar (this is key!!!). There were a total of 58 trades and 45 were winners for at lest 60 pips, resulting in 77.6% winning trades. There is much interpretation for the information i gathered to help formulate TP#1, TP#2, and SL for the GBPJPY pair. This took 2 hours plus to gather. so, may have to pick and choose from the pairs. thinking only those with 100+ pips daily and above. Anyway, take a look at the attached excel sheet to review. Let me know if you think this is enough info to establish guidelines for trading this using the daily charts. I think the TP#2 will be the biggest challenge because we will not get the max move. so, consider 50-80% of max move as possible and maybe the 10 cross of the 3 will acheive that. Maybe this should be included in the back testing for a better idea. Any other mechanisms for exit to easily back test other pairs? T4L

But before that, (refer to the attached chart) 1 is clearly an entry signal. 2 is also an entry signal (but big candle maybe not). 3 and 4 is also an entry signal. My question is how to even avoid entry 1,2 and 3,4. How many whip like that is consider a sick or slow market? But after reading Waterflame Single Post for weak market. Waterflame is right, there is really no way to avoid this sick market from the start until you place 2 trades and hit stop lost on both trades. So in conclusion, i would stop the trades after 2 trades and wait for a break out; draw two almost parallel trendlines (one higher high and lower low) and wait for the candle to break. Feel free to comment. Regards Jimmypippy

hello guys, i appreaciate much your discussions and that you help others, thank you, T4L, you can shoot all here, np... take care

I've been evaluating this system with several others and this by far is simple and profitable without the added stress. Just looking at some 15min charts from this morning's action showed some smooth money making trends. Great system, WaterFlame. I have my alarm clock set for the wee hours (I'm in NY) to really get on top of the nice movers. As I'm not a big fan of EA's either, but I would like to set up an EA just for my exits. In particular, when the CCI returns to zero (or any other variable parameter). This seems to capture significant pips on a nice run. Is there anything out there that doesn't require programming knowledge to make this happen???? Ideally, I just want to set the timeframe to moniter and specify the exit (0, 100, 200 etc). I like to analyze my entries fairly well with this system but the exits are straight forward and getting back to sleep would be nice. Thanks for any help. J

T4L, I can appreciate the time involved in back testing. I have a couple of questions and a suggestion that might save some time with regards to the other pairs. On the 13 losses, when the 3ema crossed over, how many pips were the losses? Second, I noticed on lines 27, 28, and 56 there were some blank areas. What was the reason for the blanks? What about using the high/low of the candle that is in the crossover signal for the SL? (Please see the attached chart.) The major disadvantage to using the preceding candle high/low instead of a set amount for the SL is the amount variance from trade-to-trade (50 to 300 pips.) However, the advantage to basing the SL on the previous candle's high/low is the SL is more in line with the feel of the market. I know people will disagree with that philosophy, and that is fine. It is a risky approach and at times it can come back and bite your account in the rear. Looking at the attached chart, using this approach one would have 2 losses out of 7 trades. Of course this approach is based on using the Daily chart only. However, if the 4H, Hourly, and 15M charts are used to gage the entry, combined with the use of a trailing SL, profits would be protected. T4L, (and anybody else who would like to comment) let me know what you think of the above, and thanks again for your time and effort put into the back testing.

Clansman- I've been doing a lot of "visual" analysis on these 15min charts and wanted to try to gather some feedback. Maybe you have the tech know-how to dig deeper if you think it would add value. By just printing up charts and marking MA/CCI 0 crossovers and CCI 100 crosses, I am picking up that MA/CCI 0 crossovers work just fine after a smooth long trend. But on the shorter trends, the CCI 100 cross better keeps you in profit or buffered from the spread. My question is : Is there a way to quantify the strength of the trend in order to decide whether to take the CCI 100 or CCI 0 exit???? Maybe that's the million dollar question. I was starting to look at longer term trends and other techs but no revelations as of yet. Just curious if you picked up on the pattern. Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks, Dawg.

The lines 27, 28, and 56 means only TP at 60 and 80 were achieved. if TP were only set at 100 or 120, would have more loosers. "X" means TP acheived and a shaded box means looser. Draw down is the lowest value in order to acheive the TPs without being stopped out. This part helps to gauge TP zones. Possible way to lower the SL would be to use the length of the signal candle for SL, but you may not get more than 60pips.... It is good at times and bad at times. so what the higher ave in our favor would be the correct path, but depends on your risk tolerance and $$management. The purpose of the daily chart analysis is to only make trades and manage at the start of a new candle. not sure if it's possible or not. therefor, this analysis is being conducted.

Clansman, Lower timeframe is great!!! i use the 5min and 1M. 1m mor for entry but heavily depend on 5m for solid patterns - candle formation, market movement, trends high/lows, etc. Note, this is scalping only during the asian markets. Because the range is small, the 5min chart seems to act like a 15m during london or us times. therefore, 1m acts like the 5min all due to lower volatility in the asian. I think this tweak is a solid key to earlier entry and possibly reentry into pullbacks/pullups too. still need weeks of experience to confirm all of this! As for pivots, i think that may not be needed during asian due to such small ranges and time. Friendly reminder that i am or can log into tradingrooms.com "ELITE Simplicity" community trading chat room for anyone interested in scalping the asian markets. my days and hours during the asian markets will not be consistant day to day due to life's responsibilities.

Hi Am getting a lot of false entries on the lower timeframes. Seem to get caught out with a reversal as I go in and this takes out the stop. Need to filter out the sick market. Am trying Stocks. Will see how it goes. T4L how you doing?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
GarethC, What time frames are you using? What pairs? and what trading sessions? I find during the asian session, using a lower time frame is key for entry. However, the larger time frame (5min and 15min) candle patterns of potential reversal, distance from the 34 line, trend direction, pullbacks/ups sequence, etc. have greater weight than on the small time frame (less than 5min. chart). I think using multimple charts helps to avoid some false signals before you realize the market is sick or lazy and then to stay on the side lines. Also, you will get some false signals no matter what and it could be a few each session. So far, the best i know to manage false signals is (1) to have a tight stop loss and (2) have two exit TP; #1 is fix amount for a few pips for 1/2 of the position and #2 to trail the other 1/2 of the position in direction of trade as each candle closes with the goal to get 2x, 3x, or 4x of the inital TP to help cancel out the loosers. Hope this helps in your trouble shooting your trading plan. T4L

Thanks for the reply. I trade London and the EU. Have also been looking at the GJ, but find it too volatile for my system. Trade the 5m with the 1m to indicate an entry. Have a TP of 10 and have done better with that. Have also been watching the trend and SR to minimise the possiblity of a turnaround. Will press on tomorrow. regards GarethC

--- 帖子 #703 ---
GarethC I like the 5min and the 1min to enter time frame too! i find it gets me in quicker and able to achieve 3-6pip gains per trade for the asian markets - only time i have to trade these days. i apply it only to eu and uj. however, i am thinking about removing uj as it is more lazy or sick market compared to eu. I stopped trading the gj as the spread is too large for me to scalp. i have evaluated other pairs and possibly the following due to lower spreads : gu, uchf, chfjpy, audjpy, audusd, and nzdusd. The end result is only focusing on 1 or maybe 2/3 pairs the most is key to being successful and keeping it simple. therefore, stick to eu and see how uj continues and either drop or change with one of the above pairs listed. how do you determine your s/r lines for placement on your charts? i typicaly draw lines for the high/low from mid session of the US till start of the asian. What time during the london session do you trade the EU? I am thinking of waking up early to trade EU and UJ 5:30am to 7am New York time. If you trade within this time, do you find at least one trade? i look back in recent days and typically see a trade signal and sometimes there is none. What is your win % for 10pip gain? and also if it is during the possible hours i may trade? Main reason i want to look to wake up early to trade later part of the london session is i my schedule makes it tough to regularly trade the asian market every day sun to thurs. i am evaluating to get to sleep a little earlier and loose some sleep. any other insight to your experience with the 5m and 1m scalping the eu would be fantastic!

Hi there. I have tried to download your CCI indicators tp programme files/FXDD-metatrader4/experts/indicators a dozen times but not successful but when download your clock and EJ candle times i have got no problem. Please help

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Sherlina, What do you mean by " CCI indicators tp "? Check your custom indi folder, make sure "CCI_Woodies_Lnx_v4.mq4" already in there.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Thanks for the reply, I have check under the customs indicators its not there. The funny things is that I download clock_v1_2 and EJ_ candle time using exactly the same method without any problem. Anyone with same problems. I serioulsy feels that this method is the best so far i have come accross thank waterflame. May god bless you.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
That's funny. Just try another CCI Woodies, I think that's OK as long as you put the same values. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #710 ---
JackButler, My apologies for not responding sooner. I have not spent much time on the forum lately. If I understand correctly, you are talking about using the 100 crossover as a TP point. I had noticed that the 100 crossover does offer a TP. Although on about half the trades it would cause a trader to short his profit. However, it is far better to have short profit, than no profit. I have also noticed that when the CCI's high (or low) corresponds with a hammer or doji, there is a high probability of a shift in the current trend's direction. Using a lower TF (such as a 5M for the 15M or the 1M for the 5M) can help to confirm the change in the trend. I also use pivot points to help confirm this. Regards,

Hello All who are trading this method! If you are scalping pairs during the asian session, feel free to log into the www.tradingrooms.com and go to the community room called "ELITE Simplicity". I am usually there and if want to scalp trade. I have been live now for two weeks now and have 19 wins and 1 loss. It's always great to have a team/group of trades applying the the same method to ensure execution is being followed 100% and not missing out on potential winning trades. I know there is another trading room for this method on another website. they focus more in the london and US sessions and they have other stuff going on too. I opened this trading room to only focus on scalping pars during the asian markets, but feel free to use it any time for your self. To all who have learned this method and recently applied it with real $ (not with micro lot trading), how is your performance with wins/loss, Risk:Reward, with what pairs, time frames, and sessions? i only focus on the EU, UJ, EJ, and considering AUDUSD and maybe some other jpy pairs. Regards, T4L

Congratulation on your success, but how do you scalp a 34 ma?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
aud, The cross of the 3EMA to the 34SMA is used for the signal along with the 34CCI index line cross zero line. is this what you are asking about? T4L

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi trader4life, Can I scalp using 30 min TF using your strategy? Can you briefly explain to me how make a correct entry? I seems to get the wrong entry and always hit my SL. My profit target is not more than 20 pips since my plan was to avoid unnecessary loss due to small capital, I decided to just need one good entry indicator where an almost 90% chance of hitting TP of 10-20pips. Pls help me out Thanks.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
...however due to time constraints (and need for sleep). I would greatly appreciate some help in developing an EA in the way I trade this system. It works well for me and would recommend it to anyone who is challanged with time. The EA would: 1. Open a trade on the candle close of the 3/34 cross for 3 lots (i use a mini account). 2. t/p one lot at 10 pips, 2nd lot at 20 pips, third lot ~ let it ride until reverse cross. 3. in any event, close any open position(s) when the cross reverses and of course open new ones with the new trend. simple stupid, right? what this does is basically keep losses mitigated for the little fake moves or even make you a little, but keep you in the game for the nice smooth runs. if anyone notices, the fake moves usually happen when volume/activity is low. this is usally when i need to be hitting the sack. when i forced myself awake using this method, it was very profitable. i don't like trading with ea's but this system is so good, i think i could get myself to sleep without worry. thanks for any help and feedback. jim

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I need some help when you say this "notice : every signal will be confirmed after the next CANDLE, behave on the Current CANDLE while the signal is appearing, and analyze it well, it will be your loosing or wining CANDLE ( with this system you will be a winner before the market behave on you ) research about it well." Can you please clarify that? every signal will beconfirmed after the next candle? So I have to enter on the chandle before it closes and then wait for confirmation two candles later?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
You are asking some very good questions! Hopefully Waterflame will answer them. I would like to know what he thinks. T4L

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I have taken that to mean the candle after the cross is the candle to make the entry decision on (see attached chart.)

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Clansman, Based on your picture, do you enter at the open of the candle with the red arrow above it? Or at the close? The candle with the red arrow: what are the characteristics during the time frame duration and the closed completed candle formation do you look for that acts as added value for longs and short positions? In my experience, i have focused more on the signal candle and the candle before. That is completed candle on the timeframe i place trades. Also look at a higher time frame if the compelted candle shows a reversal or not. As for the candle (or couple after the signal candle) after the signal candle, i have not spent much attention to it. I do recall thinking to my self many times that i wish i had waited to enter on the 1, 2, 3, or sometimes 4th candle after the signal candle to get a better entry due to pullback (pullup) before price moves in the continued direction. I due realize somes that i would have also missed the trade (or turn into a losser) sometimes too. The end result is a smaller stop loss. turn offs is missed the trade all together or late entry results in missing target profit and turns into a looser. I think this topic of the candles before and after the signal candle is a great topic to discuss with others after many weeks of $$ trading experience. Anyone with value added input, I encourage those individuals to add to this latest discussion topic. Regards, T4L

--- 帖子 #720 ---
The best signals for me are the ones where the 34sma has a clear direction up or down. Then price pops accross the 34sma and back again in the direction of the trend at the same time the 34cci pops accross the "0" line and back again in the direction of the trend.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
i think this system work for me, thx

--- 帖子 #722 ---
This system is amazing when you only take signals generated near the open of the Tokyo London or New York sessions. Most signals i've seen generated at least 50 pips. Any signal made within a 2 hours of the New York session open is a signal you really should trade. I used the 5-40 ma's, this system is great for catching HUGE moves.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Great system , but which the best timeframe for this system? and the best pairs? regards, felipe

--- 帖子 #724 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #725 ---
It's all on the first page.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
That is all some very interesting feedbacl! I must agree with the open of a session (in my case asian) the signals seem to be the ideal ones to take! Thanks to all of those who provided their comments on this system. i also think correlation aids in picking which pair or pairs to enter a trade or to focus on during a specific session. T4L

--- 帖子 #727 ---
You are asking a question about time frames and pairs to trade can only be answered by you. You need to experiment with a few time frames, pairs, and sessions, to find out what best fits your personality. That also applies to TP and SL too. Good luck exploring! Let us know of your findings. I like scalping on 5min. and only have time to trade during asian session. i wish i could trade open of lond and US sessios too. i would probably stick with the 5min chart too, but increase my TP and adjust stop as price moves in my direction to protect profits and hopefully catch additional pips. T4L

--- 帖子 #728 ---
thank you Waterflame I have been using your systme for a few weeks now, but i did this before reading your thread, Im now on page 16 and understand it so much better, just last night I made 7 trades on the 15m chart 6 wins 1 small loss. cheers to you. and Thank you again. Im going to pass on the 10ema you added on page 16, the entry and exits are already clear enough for me.

Looking forward to your return.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Poocher, You are referring to your trading chart time frame? If so, what time frame? I am looking at 15m, 5m, and 1m. i trade off of 5m. I have looking at this and also wondering if higher time frames looking at the 34SMA providing trend or trendless direction also aids in focusing to long or short. I started looking at weekly, daily, 4H, and 60M to see if 34SMA shows any clues for direction.. However, since i am only scalping during asian session it seems very difficult due to these two variables. Bottom line, wish i could trade open of london and USD for 2-4 hours. it would be oh so pipgreatness! T4L

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Waterflame, Will it also expand on your cognitive process of technical analysis? or psychological part of this when viewing multiple time frames to make decisions with less emotion/fear/question? Anyway, always look forward to your experienced, enlightenment, trading ways! Regards, T4L

Hi Waterflame, I think most of us eagerly awaits the new modifications you mentioned you are working on. Hope to hear from you soon.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Hi to all, In post # 619 with the heading "DOTDOT", Waterflame introduced a new indicator by the name of "Hi-Lo.mq4". I am very interested in using this indicator but I want to use it in a different platform. Thus, I need to understand the workings of this indicator so I can code it in a different coding language (Easylanguage). Unfortunately, I have about zero knowledge of MQL coding so I cannot decipher the code to understand the inner workings of this indicator. I am looking for somebody with MQL knowledge that could explain to me in plain English what the indicator is about, how the calculations is made, how it determines when to plot above the price and when to plot below, etc. I could see that it is a moving average on the High and a moving average on the Low that is used but that is about as much as I could make out of the mql code. Any help will be appreciated

--- 帖子 #735 ---
I am excited by this thread and will start trying it live in a short time. As their seems to be some indecision on exiting profitably, let me tell you what i've see on the almost all the charts i've seen posted. If it's a decently long trade that has taken the trade to the +- 200 on the cci, after the cci has peaked (high or low depending on sell or buy), exit as the cci returns to either the positive or negative 150 pt. Now this is just an eyeball number, but it's a pretty accurate eyeball number and i imagine the 150 lines could be added. Check it out on some of the posted charts, funny even on the charts that have the new 10 sma added it gives a much better(more profitable signal. Just trying to help.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hi Waterflame, I've been trying your system for 2 months on demo with an average of 2000 pips per month on 3 pairs. it was awesome! Last week I finally went live and made 1100 pips in a ONE SINGLE WEEK (don't ask me how much I slept). Yes, I doubled my account within just one week (it is possible even with my conservative money management). Waterflame, thanks a lot! Trader4life, with all my respect to you - you are not trading Elite as it should be - so, be careful with your advices... ppl listen to you and may went into a different direction. I saw you trading - you scalp 3-5 pips per trade; weanwhile, Waterflame doesn't even mention it. He speaks about good profits!!! here is a chart of 420 pips move I mage last week on Eur/USD. God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I am glad to see people are starting to post here again. I thought the method and the thread died more or less. PippenaintEZ, thanks for your observations I surely going to monitor it. Konstas, How do you decide how long to stay in a trade to be able to catch those long runs of yours? In the last couple of weeks I was looking for something to at least give a slightly better chance to stay out of the chop. The Hi-Lo indicator does it sometimes but does make a huge difference. I guess Waterflame is correct wrt there is not really something to do about it and we just have to live with it. I guess the nice running trades makes up for all the bad trades due to chop in the long run.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Konstas, tell me,please, what other pairs besides Euro/USD do you use in your trade? Do you exit and reenter when 3EMA cross 10SMA or you just wait for 3EMA to cross 34SMA for exit out of the old position and enter into the new one? Thank you, You have very great results! Very impressing! Greetings,

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I made 7 trades today on 15 minutes and every trade was a loss. I have followed the system very acurately and presice. I think it shoul be done much more to make this system effective.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Post what times you made the trades and what pairs you traded that lost. Sometimes there are times to not pull the trigger - regardless what the indicators say! Of course there are going to be losers, particularly like now when the market's are ranging up and down, you're going to have (with ANY system) false break-outs. In my opinion (and experience) this is one of the best systems/strategies in the FF and I use it almost exclusively successfully. Conversely, you can't base it as a great strategy just based on Fridays 300+ gain for the USD! That was highly unusual and you may never see that again. Traders that caught that CAUGHT IT BY ACCIDENT, as few knew what the dollar was going to do. It was a trend, and a great one, and I'm happy for the traders that caught the ride (as I did). But it was a quirk! Anyway, post your charts or just the info and let's see if I (or anyone) can critique your trades. perhaps you did nothing wrong, but I can't tell yet. I've had 16 losing trades in a row (but NOT with the Elite system. I was a newbee to trading and I'd jump into too many trades too fast). It sure seemed like the market was just out to get me personally. As soon as I pulled the trigger they reversed. Small losses to be sure, but that didn't help me question my sanity for awhile!

Bonjour lite27 Your SL were maybe too short and this morning was not good with this system (too many range)

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Flamenco,thank you very much for your support and desire to help me. I am in forex for 8 years already. I have studied many systems and developed my owen systems. After I found this thread, I was very interesting in Waterflame system. I feel,that this system must have very strong performance. Its very unusually for me,that I am so interested in some particular system. Whats happened today in Euro/USD pair was unpleasant,but it was a range market after very strong fall of euro. So,its normall,that market range and try to correct. Flamenco, maiby it is possible to meet peaple,who use this system,in some chat? Maybe on skype or somewere else? Together its much more effective and what is also important, interesting. Thank you once more and many pips, Cheers,

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I think,that this system can not be used as the main system, just as a sacondary. Well,during tranding times there many system which work, but in my humble opinion this system need to be improved much much more. It is very raw and gives many fals signals. But it is my opinion only. Sorry, for this pessimism,guys, cheers,

--- 帖子 #744 ---
im finding when I wake up early, before 6am EST the signals are good, from then till arouind 10 am est. after that, there seems to be lots of false signals on the 15 minute chart. when I trade later on in the day - from 9pm EST - around 1am est I trade the 1 hour.. I believe this system needs to be traded at specific times for better results,, I do like this system, although I am hating the EUR/CHF at the moment

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Maybe this system don't suit to you, but it's a very good system for main system... Have you demo traded it before ? I'm follow him since beginning, and i can say you I'm very happy with it, because simplicity... With time I have make my own rules (on the trend by EMA34 ie) Look picture (EJ15") : What do you think ? Just following anle of EMA34 ? Looking for a greater TF ? Now, look for same pair on 1H : A short from 168.42... what do you prefer ?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
hey there remmie where did you get that MA trend bar ? I would like to aquire something like that, I have added the 200ma ti the charts but would like to be able to see the overall trend without swithcing charts..

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hello, It's just a self made indic, just for see overall of any MA on any lenght (see comments on parameters... Maybe i can improve it

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Thanx Remmie!

Is everyone getting a fair amount of trades where the cci and the ma crosses aren't in sync?? I ahven't taken some trades today that turned into good movers because the cci was already well up or down by the time the 3ema and the 34 sma crossed on the 15 min. chart. Also, waterflame never said (i don't believe) but on the ma's are they supposed to be applied on the close of the candle for both?? I tend to get very few that really sync up, lots are a cnadle or so off, but the ones i'm talking about in the beginning of the post are entirely different...an example is the jpy crosses right now...wed. 7:30 pm est usa. the cci'sbeen running cranzy down in the minus' and we just now had a 3//34 downcross sell signal on the chart....weird!!

[quote=Konstas;2159991] Trader4life, with all my respect to you - you are not trading Elite as it should be - so, be careful with your advices... ppl listen to you and may went into a different direction. I saw you trading - you scalp 3-5 pips per trade; weanwhile, Waterflame doesn't even mention it. He speaks about good profits!!! quote] Konstas, Thank you for the tip on awareness of impacting others. i will try to keep that in mind with future postings. I have and do admit my exit strategy does wonder off from Waterflame's rules of exit. Because I look to scalp during Asian session (6pm to 9:30pm eastern - New York) with a specific daily pip goal to get 9-12pips, i feel the exit strategy change is needed ~90% of the time. At the present time, i am not able to trade during open of london or US session. Sure wish i could and sure would like too as i look back at the charts on a daily basis saying WOW, WOW, WOW what text book trade for nice double digit pip gains. Waterflame's exits work wonderful during those times. However in my experience with the asian session and my daily pip goal, i need to alter the rationale for exiting a trade with profit. I try to make it clear that i exit based on my personal goals and everyone else needs to establish their own rationale for exiting a trade by following Waterflame's or they create their own style. The exit to a winning trade is the toughest and probably the most important variable in any system (after learning to follow the rules 100% of the time). If you or anyone else is experiencing profitable (equal or greater than 12pips consistently) scalping during the Asian session (6pm to 9:30pm eastern - New York), please share! I am always open to improvements, ideas, comments, suggestions, constructive criticism, etc. if it means coming closer to achieving my trading plan's mission statement. MISSION STATEMENT: This business plan is my trading procedure documented to describe in detail all aspects of a position that I, as a trader, will follow without flaw. This plan will explain my actions, objectives, risk tolerance, individual circumstances, personality traits, tools, criteria for entry and exit (trading methodology), establish a general approach, and procedures in the markets in order to achieve my goals. This outline defines my course of action in a disciplinary way in order to preserve my capital from excessive risk. The end result from following these procedures is to be proficient in all the trading skills transforming me into a consistently successful master trader. Regards, T4L

I come across many signals where the ma crossing is one candle later too. maybe waterflame's latest update will address this comment. I see EJ on 15min. two bars ago have a cross down for a short with ma and cci on the same bar. would be up 20pips. did not take trade.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I think,that in the trending market every, not very bad system works. But most of time we have a ranging market. And whats do we have here? Very simple. This system does not work in about 60-65% of time when we have a flat market,as many other do the same. So, it is a trandfollow system,as many other are. So, whats to do about 65% of time? To use stochastik, EMAs and candle patterns in order to be a winner. It is my opinion. Maiby, my opinion is wrong. It is possible, but it is just my opinion. But I think,this system, if improved, can give good results. Again, it is just my opinion. If somebody used this system can share her or his results, please, do it and lets we help each other to improve our perfomance. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I think that this system does rather well in a ranging market. The 34ma and 3 ma correct themselves and normally become viable a couple of times / day. I don't think this system would like anything better than moving +- 100 pips/day w/i a 300 pip range for an extended period of time. I believe this system would be a gold mine in that environment. Right now, all the "systems" are having problems. Unless you're on the right side of one of the big usd cross moves...or were lucky enough to catch the big gbp move like last night, things are going to be a little dicey. The world banks are pushing the currencies towards their "new normal" rates, and until they're finished we're just along for the ride (hopefully) or getting our row boats swamped by the sunami's (hopefully not). It makes the 20 pip quick hitters on the 15 min.charts look pretty good and if you're lucky enough to get onboard for one of the tidal waves like last nights 300 pip monster on the gbpusd...smile and send some to your favorite charity!!

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Not all currency pairs are ranging. I have attached the GBP/USD daily chart. Placing a sell order at 1.9786 on July 30 would have earned 1,084 pips by CoB New York market yesterday. Do not let yourself get locked into just one or two currencies or time frames. Just my two cents worth.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
very good system if you find good exit i trade it with euro/usd and usd/jpy

--- 帖子 #756 ---
YOU CAN USE LAGUERRE TO CONFIRM ENTRY AND EXITS use settings Gamma 0.80, levels 0.15, 0.85, 0.45 bars to read 9500 for entry long laguerre above 0.15 level for short below 0.85 LEVEL Exit for long laguerre starts come down below 0.85 for short starts to come up to level 0.15 try it and reply sorry for my english

Hi everyone, there is no HOLY GRAIL! Every system has losses. this one is not exception. the point is that the losses are small - 10-15 pips. but profits are big: 50-200 pips if you catch a wave. having such risk/profit ratio you should be in profit on a long run. this sytem gives 40-50% wins - (even if it is 35%) the profit is bigger than small losses - you just have to believe in the system. Of course, if you can do tech, analysis on H1-D1 - it will increase your win percentage to 50-70%. Just learn how to recognize when market is indecisive. I personally trade Eur/usd and USD/JPY always. Plus sometimes I work with eur/jpy and gbp/usd. I use 10ema as exit only if a trend was fast - almost like a spike - it usually means quick "come back" - so if it crosses 10ema - I'm out. if a trend grew gradually - I wait a crossover of 3ema and 34sma. but in most cases I trust my guts (not always works though). just my few ideas, if they work for you - nice! If not, seek your own! God bless

Excellent advise Konstas! Markets are a little crazy these days and many systems/strategies aren't working. Way too many false break-outs and reversals. Timing is crucial right now in knowing when to stay out of the market and not trade. Impatient traders and those who believe indicators (any and all of them) work consistantly to predict market movement are watching their accounts (demo or real) depleting. Lower time frame traders are getting hammered!

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi Funtos, need to be tested, but seem filtered some trades... thank !

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I personally, find this system very bad on ranging market and not the best one on trending market. So, my opinion is,that this system can not be used as the main system, but just as a secondary system. But it is just my opinion,guys. Sorry for my pessimism,

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Again ? ... No, just a small reflexion. I think than founding a trading system who suit to you is a personal research. Maybe you think it's a bad system, but for me it's a strong and simple system, and i use it as main system... Don't be too much pessimist, and try other... good luck !

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Dear Flamenco, you speak about 10-15 pips stop loss and 50-200 pips of profit. Can you,please, tell me what time frame do you use? where do place your stop loss and take profit target? What is your winners/losers rate with this system? Thank you and many pips! Greetings,

--- 帖子 #763 ---
What I was referring to was that when you have false breakouts in a ranging market you usually lose about 10 to 15 pips before you exit the trade once it sinks in that the pair isn't going anywhere. But when the market is trending you can frequently bag 50 + pips. The problem is (with ANY system/strategy that I've ever seen) is you NEVER know when that break-out is going to reverse on you OR climb and put boucoup pips in your account. The markets have been acting weird lately because the Big Dogs are doing things I don't understand or know anything about. We - as small traders are just chasing their tails. Meanwhile I went back to scalping and not worrying about big moves - trends - or indicators. In essence, what I'm saying is that I'm confused, as most strategies I like and use are not producing profits on the smaller time frames (15M to 4hr) at the present time. I'm only making profits on 1M &amp; 5M time frames, OR on daily time frame only.

Has anyone put out an ea for the Elite System? Looks like it would be pretty easy.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi All, Just introducing myself. Going to start trading elite system now and document it with a trade journal. I have known Waterflame for a fair amount of time now and I know his system works. I am just adding 4 things to my way of trading elite that I see helps. Will let you guys know as I progress my wins and losses. I have a little more stricter entry so it might filter out some trades you have taken (good or bad , either way it will just do that). I am gonna be tied up with personal stuff in the next month but will try get trading when I can and post results here after each 10 trades. Nice to "speak" to everyone. See you in tradingrooms and irceforex soon,. Chris(En0X) PS, Waterflame you are the king

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hi en0x, Please be so kind and explain to us what the 4 things are that you add to the elite system for your own trading. Christoff

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I dont want to change Elite as elite is fine as it is but with my personal trading I trade with a 50ema, 150, 200 and 365 ema. I wont take trades if the cross happens too close to an ema as I find that more often then not price rides those emas while in the trend. I prefer to have the cross happen quite some distance above it to allow for movement. Anyways, will post results of every 10 trades here.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
What a magnificent system!!! I started reading yesterday, and after 20 pages was so impressed, that today I traded live account with it. More than 70 pips just one trade. You are a good generous person and I wish you the best, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #769 ---
you should never do that ! trade live with a new system you've read about. demo it for at least 3 months to make sure you understand and apply it thoroughly. this my advice. take it or leave it.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Thanks, BBPI for warning, but I really don't know what's there to understand - a few simple rules, all on the first page? The crossower of two MAs? It doesn't take long to make a simple template and go through few months or even a year of charts calculating the possibilities, how many trades would have won, how many trades would have lost, and what is the ratio of wins and losses? Basically all MAs crossovers work in trending markets and they don't work in ranging markets. Trends don't last forever, so just ouwait the period of range and then go on again. What is there to study for the whole 3 months? I have worked a lot with MAs crossovers, the difference is that this one is so finely tuned up. I understand you meant well so thank you for the warning. On the other hand simple things are simple so there is no need to overcomplicate them, that's my opinion. I am posting that trade. Regards, Lietuve

Hello Lietuve What's your setup for fibzones ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Hi, cmfxmen, the answer is 5. It defines ranges pretty nicely, doesn't it? Cheers, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #773 ---
lietuve, can you post the fibzone indicator

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Sure, with pleasure. Lietuve

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Thanks for the upload

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Hello Lietuve Thank for answers look the setup it's ok ? Can you explain a litle more when you entry exaclty with this setup if you can post a few charts of your entry with explanation that will cool thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #777 ---
This system is pretty amateur and simple, its great for newbies, but advanced traders, their totally aware that crossover systems are kinda ancient . Good luck 2 you all

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Has anyone attempted to put together an Elite EA yet?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hi cmfxmen, Sorry for beeing so late to respond. I wasn't at home for quite a few days. The way you posted fibs ind looks ok on the chart, but I use it with the input MAperiod of 5. During the bigger trend it supports the trend nicely, so I don't have to be so jumpy during the longer trend. In ranges I use this indicator to play ranges, i.e. sell at upper band and buy at the lower band. I use this indicator mostly to trade during the ranges. It is not exactly what Waterflame's system is designed to do, and I don't want to mess up somebody's thread with my ways of trading, but if you want to PM me, I can share what I am doing to define trend, you use your own judgement. And, of course, there are periods of time I don't know what's going on, during these periods I simply do not trade at all. Regards, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #780 ---
You are absolutely right, it is a pretty amateur and simple system, on the other hand did you ever asked yourself why MA crossover system beeing so ancient is still in play and even very experienced traders like Alexander Elder are using it? KISS Good luck to you too. Cheers, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #781 ---
[quote=dznmrd;2231747]This system is pretty amateur and simple, its great for newbies, but advanced traders, their totally aware that crossover systems are kinda ancient . SIMPLICITY is the ultimate form of SOPHISTICATION! You can't consider me a newbee since I make my living trading for probably longer than you've been trading. I wish you, as an 'advanced trader' who is apparently above us 'simpletons' who like a couple of MA's and only the CCI all the best in your trading. Meanwhile, I'll be laughing all the way to the bank along with a few more of my 'non-advanced' buddies. And by the way, I am very familiar with Dean's 'Advanced Course'. I've traded with it, and I gave it up a few months back for a better but amateurish and simple system/strategy that I found right here, and it didn't cost me a cent!

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Here is how I trade when the market is flat: sell at high fib band buy at low fib band. It lasted the whole night and was a lot of fun. Now, though, the MAs are crossing so let's get back to see if the downtrend will develop. Remember, originally Waterflame's target was 10 pips after the cross!

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Now waiting for a candle to close and see. Target secured by s/l. Live charts attached. Simple, isn't it!

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I know... the s/l was not by the rules and so on..., but I've been working all night and wanted to secure my 10 pips and get some rest. Later I will look for a better entry if downtrend will go on a higher time frames. Results: open short @ 155.33; closed short @ 155.05. 28 pips in a matter of 2 hours. I am not greedy and don't cry for pips I would have had, I am happy with what I have. Simple. Cheers, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Good points Flamenco! I don't go to a bank yet, cuz' I'm compounding my account now... but it grows and pretty soon I will. What I like about this system - you never blow out your entire account - if you stick to rules, it's just impossible! Very safe, and with right MM - we all can live on Hawaii! Cheers

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Another cross - I am waiting to get into a trade. MAs crossed 1 hour before German ifo business confidence data. It came out worse than expected (the blue/black candle). I remember the discussion here how big a candle should be to be caled Monster Candle? Let's see: Fibo bands width 62 pips. White candle before news 96 pips. I guess I can call this white/blue before news candle the Monster Candle. So inspite of the cross, no trade for me. Waiting. Cheers, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Bought chfjpy - this time s/l by the rules; bot @97.68, S/L @ 97.48 (low of the signal candle). Let's see how this one is going to work.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Oh, well, part of the game! S/L was taken out and we are crossing down back again. I'll wait till H1 candle close and see is it a new signal candle of crossing down, or we are going into range again. Loss = 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
I guess that's a sick market condition Waterflame warned not to trade. MAs crossing up and down on every candle. I will wait for NY open and see what's developing then. Anybody trading the system, or just me keeping the thread alive?

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hi guys, I'm sorry this must seem such a stupid question but I'm having a hard time trying to understand what actually constitutes a entry signal. I've looked at the first post and read and I still can't seem to pin point which is the actual entry candle - I have put two arrows in both directions and I'm using the MA colour thing, I was hoping someone could please tell me which one is the setup candle 'advertising' and the actual candle that you actually initiate the trade on. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hello Lietuve thanks for sharing your charts now we understand how you use your fibo indicator for entry For me i use exactly Elite system by Waterflame Regards

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Waterflame, Can you explain the lines in the CCI for me. I noticed that they have a color line proceeding the others. Thanks fxBill

Hello all Just this post for to show what i anderstood for use "Elite system" regards

Knew it would happen eventually. Now it's time to take the 'Simplicity' word out of this thread and rename it "Confusion is the Ultimate Prelude to Failure!" Are you really attempting to trade this system with a chart looking like this?

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hello Flamenco143 Maybe you has not read all the thread have a look at this link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=85226 i think "simplicity" doesn't mean "simplest" and for avoid a lot of false signals we have to do find mechanical analisys process from fundamental analisys process but i'm not sure for nothing i'm just newbie who try to understand (1year on Forex and not profitable yet) but you look a protrader please correct my wrong way and share your vision for entry with this system for help all newbies here Regards

--- 帖子 #796 ---
That pdf file on that posting is one of the best I've ever read and it is excellent. My posting to you was not critical of the additions to the Elite system on your chart, but only of your choice of using the same colors for everything. It gave me a hallucinatory nightmare, but if it works for you, the more power to you! To decide whether or not to enter (or exit) a trade I need confirming information to stand out quickly and be different than the other indicators or information on my charts. I say 'toe-may-toe' (tomato), you say 'toe-mah-to'. Regarding your above post - I couldn't agree more! However - no amount of technical analysis or indicators will predict what the big dogs are going to do next. We, as individual traders are just little dogs snapping along behind at their heels. Trying to predict price action based on historical movement is very much like (in the 70's) going to hear Elvis perform after he has already left the building. False breakouts will always be there. Timing and good money management is the only way to overcome them.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hi Flamenco 143 I agree my colors charts are a litle "liquid" lol i want just answers to you for prédictions never i think or can pretend make predictions only Bernanke or Trichet can do that it's just probability when i start analisys before on daily and 4h chart i try to find the trend and after i pass on 15mn chart and here when i find one "material" for buy = + one more + one more + other + and after i look the sell "material" one = - one more = - then i wait and see the move price if signal appear (look at same time news upcoming) i don't think (+++++)(--) buy entry (-----)(++) sell entry your are right for strong MM to safe you capital anayway thank for your interest to my post i could explain my chart Sorry for my bad English Regards

I am very dissapointed Waterflame. Actually I watched only the first video, in which even the MAs were not present - the major support and resisstance lines were the theme. While it is very important to take them into account while trading, these points could and often are broken, everybody knows it, that's not the issue of the thread you started here. You started a thread of a trending market that was finely tuned using 2 MAs: EMA(3) and SMA(34), with a proper tuning in worked in a trending market recovering losses one would expect in a ranging market as it always is the case of any crossing of MAs. All of the sudden you are abandoning thie purpose of the thread and explaining how to use major support and resisstance lines... and even don't bother to put the MAs on your video. Is it you? Why I am so dissapointed? 'cause you do not see the simpliest thing, the "simplicity" thread has it's weak point - the change of the tactics when markets are not in the trend but start ranging. Markets range most of the time, (emphasis on time) so if one is an agresive trader that wants to be in the market most of the time, one should know the difference. I was hoping you have some new solution to this weak point of the thread. You do not! That's ok with me, I see the difference, but less experienced traders do not. Until you can tell something substantial about it, please, don't confuse traders that are not experienced enough to know the difference, either you have to have more time to find a solution or your new thread is not serious enogh to be followed. Having said all this, I should also add that I am not a person that use harsh words easily. I wish you the best, bet whoever decides to follow your new videos, should take care not to do it with real money. Regards, Lietuve

Hello. I found this thread a few days ago and managed to read it all over the weekend. The system looks and sounds like a pipmaker. Thank you Waterflame for sharing and tutoring. I spotted this entry today at 6.30 GMT. It seems to be stalling at the S1 level after reaching 82 pips from the close of the entry bar. Anyone in it? I was wondering if it's a valid entry though since the CCI reversed on the next bar so there would have have been a choice to exit with a loss at that point. Also the entry was just at the S2 level. I would love to know the opinion of Waterflame of course and any other people's who have been practicing the system for a while. I tried the chat: there seems to be a dozen people connected but nobody is answering.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hi again. Already have my doubts about entries... Is this a valid entry where you see the arrow? The 3 ema hasn't crossed the 34 sma yet but one of the rules says: " [ at most enter with CCI crossing zero line because CCI is perfect describing price action ]". Could anyone enlighten me please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Hope I'm not overwhelming the thread with pics. Opened a short on gJ at 181.49. Moved SL to breakeven. PT at 180.84 (S3). I would love someone to comment but this thread seems deserted. Maybe because of the time (13.20 GMT)? P.S. - While I was posting the PT was reached (+65 pips) . So far so good. Thanks Waterflame. This one is still a beauty (128 pips so far). Since it goes with the trend I should have waited for one of the exits suggested by the WF, but I wanted to close with a sure profit my first trade with this system, so I won't complain. BTW, the previous trade was breakeven.

you are welcome alright... i haven't yet the chance to finish the last part of the lessons, of how to avoid fakes and mistakes by the fibonacci study, but coming soon there you will see why every rule in this system have a role, stop loss, targets etc there is nothing just assembled, everything have a meaning

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thank God you opened the thread again WF. I'm glad you're back and hope you will find the time to appear here more often. I'm also eager to see the rest of the lessons. Thank you anyway for bringing your knowledge here. Keep up the good work!

Hi alright, Don't worry - you are doing fine! False breaks out happen - just accept them as small losses. Entry point is a personall matter. I try to enter as close to the 34 as possible. So if a candle closes relatively far, I open half lot, if it goes to my direction - excellent. if it retraces back toward 34, I open another half - cutting possible losses. if it was a false break - I lose less, if it goes in our direction - we make more. opening as close as possible to 34 increases profit, and decreases loss. another idea for those who r interested: I used the system on 1M Eur/USD last month - 2157pips for 4 weeks! from london open till NY close. lots of time to sit in front of the screen... but what can we do?!! many pips to everyone.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Thanks Konstas. That might be a good idea to open 1 half at a better price with far candles. About the 1 minute EU do you mean you got +2157 pips? Please tell me you were trading a real account. Did u watch only that currency at that TF?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi Alright, I don't trade demo anymore - waste of time. If I test a new system or try out improvements, I still trade live but with cents. Usually 20-50 cents per pip, depending on how "sound" my innovations are. hehe yes, I wanted to say +2157pips. I made half of them, cuz I still work my daily job, and I need some sleep. but if I traded from London open till NY close - it would produce such profit. anyway, I don't really like 15M for this system - not much actioins. sometimes you can sit at the desk 5 hrs and gain 10-15 pips, cuz it retraces. crazy! I started trading 1M - it also has big moves for 100+ pips and you enter them on the very top!!! I also found another TP improvements which allows to double results, eliminating ranging market, but i'm still working on them - when they r polished and proved themselves I will present them to audience. anyway, I didn't mean to change anything in Waterflame's system, or add anything to it. I'm grateful for his gift to us, so we all can benefit from this system. LOTS of pips to everyone. ps: I still don't understand ppl who limit themselves to 5-10 pips per day!!!

--- 帖子 #815 ---
sounds great, im curious about your improvements, every good idea is almost welcome have fun

--- 帖子 #816 ---
That's really great, Konstas and I'm so happy for you. Can you please clarify if you have tested other currencies as well and if yes, do they not fit that TF? If I can also ask a couple more of questions: - is there any particular exit strategy you find more profitable among the ones WF suggested? - do you pay attention to SR areas when you enter or, since the short TF, that becomes less relevant? Looking forward to your improvements to be shared. Thank you P.S. What a great thread!

--- 帖子 #817 ---
konstas and alright, i m very glad you have found a way to be in + for your accounts, but there is still an issue about what kon is talking about... this system can be used for scalpers on lower time frames, even on ticks chart, i have used it on dax and ftse, but it will be hardcore trading... if you reached this level to identify a breakout of S/R for a fib target or to avoid it 1 minute before entry, congratulations, but please think about others who are " i will not say lamer " but still learning it... if you have some underground, join me on irc.ircforex.com

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hi WF. Can you please provide the full adress for irc? I understand irc.ircforex.com is the server name. I also can connect to a group named #eliteforex but nobody ever replies on that chat. Thank you

--- 帖子 #819 ---
I havn't tested other pairs for they have big spread, even 3pip spread is A LOT on 1m tf where actions happens all the time. the smaller the spread the better. but i think it should work for any pair with a small spread. exit strategy... this is exactly what i'm working on right now, and this is what i think improves the system - BUT ONLY ON 1M TF!!! can't share it now, cuz it is in a process of testing. yes, I pay attention to S/R even on 1M, and see how it looks on 5M and 15M - if nothing sound appears on 5m - then it's just noise. I hope it's helpful.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Konstas, do you enter emmidiately after 3EMA crossed 34 SMA or you wait for closing of the 1 minute candle? So, EMAs crossed and candle closed and the opening of next 1min. candle enter? Correct? Thank you for sharing your expirience and your great results. I do use often 1 min. chart too,but as enter point on basis of 1h,30m and 15 m. charts.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Entry... hmmm - I don't know how to explain it... but after watching a market for days you should get feeling of it. when it croesses with power and when it crosses slowly. in most cases I wait till the candle closes... but... but... sometimes - I enter when the price crosses. you understand what I mean, right?!! as I said before, entry is a personal matter of everyone - there is no strickt rule for me. however, if you want to know - 95% of the time it's better to wait till the candle closes. if everyone is interested in results: Mon.+150, Tue. +285, Wed. zero-broke even, even though was +90 at one point., Today +100 so far, NY just opened... will see how it will go! God bless and many pips to everyone!!!

Hu guys, i have been just following the canadian dude thread for some months and stumbled upon this one and would like some one to point me in the right direction, Water flame has a very nice graph and i have been tryingto get it uploaded to me platform but to no avail. Could any one who has done it explain how i get the 34SMA trend line to show on my graph, i have noticed that the elite.TPL has not uploaded coudl that be the problem, thanks in advance any one who can help.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Alrite , can you help with my situation of explaining how i can get the SM34 trend liner showing on my graph That Water flame has got ?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
oh boy! Londonguy... with my respect, if u don't know how to put a MA on ur chart I wouldn't recommend u to trade. get familiar with a platform first. open Indicators/custom/moving average then in parameters set 34 - and simple - that's easy

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Konstas, i will make you proud sir, thank you for helping i am going to try right away, keep helping us newbies , i will remeber this favour sir.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Konstas, one final request pls pls how do i get the yellow line that connects the candles, im not too worried about the exit line.t 3 ema line is what i am asking about. Londonguyyyy

--- 帖子 #827 ---
hi Londonguy, just as an advise, like konstas already mentioned, learn the plateform first, if you have than some questions about the system, you are welcome

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Good evening !!! congratulation for wonderful thread !!! does anyone talk about automatized this simple sistem? is it possible ?? anyone has try to do it?? thank's....

--- 帖子 #829 ---
It wont be long before some1 attempts to make an EA out of this, but I personally would trade manually especially I am testing it on 1m TF and so far dont see EA making money on 1m charts, possibly on 15m but havent traded 15m yet.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
nice both 1m 15 min but i'm looking for a good programmer to automatized the template. first signal is 1m than wait to open the second confirm the cross 15 min

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Can you upload the template and the indicators?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Its all the same just change the timeframe

--- 帖子 #833 ---
But his screenshot there are some indicators that no appears in the original one.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Oh, must be Nicks own addition. Ask him and he might share

--- 帖子 #835 ---
This looks like a great system but can anyone explain why the strategy has been made unavailable on page 1 of the thread?

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Its now kept as a secret and only distributed among elite members

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Secret? Elite? Is this not contrary to all the rules of this forum?

--- 帖子 #838 ---
dont dont Dave, I havent read the terms and conditions of the the site

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Hi All, can anyone guide me to the instruction page regarding this thread !! as it seems the 'ATTENTION' thread has been removed from the front page . Thank you Nightpipper.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
I am very, very interested!

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Just out of curiosity I wanted to see what this system was about to kill time. So, I went through the thread and all I can say is that I was schooled in a manner that made me giggle. What a great strategy for entry! Thanks to the simple one

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Care to explain??? Ive looked over this thread in the past and it looked rather cryptic

--- 帖子 #843 ---
hey guys i got 3 questions: 1. why did the original post get deleted? and 2. does the cci woodies indie repaint? and 3. what do we use for a SL? still reading thread, AWESOME SYSTEM!

--- 帖子 #844 ---
anyone? After reading most of the thread, im VERY confused on what even the TP is with this system. some people say 15 pips hard stop.... hmm all pairs?

--- 帖子 #845 ---
I think there was no targetprofit by this methode its up to the trader. Of course you can always take the opposite signal. I like TP with Pivots (P, S1, S2, R1, R1) if the whole picture is right to hold the position longer. Nice weekend

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I saw a great chart you uploaded with 420 profit pips. I can not tell what MA you are using.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Does ANYONE trade this method anymore? Why did it die?

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Do you have the original setup instructions? If you so could you post or send to me please, f.x.trader@hotmail.com . thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
How is the exit strategy plan coming along. Just curious that is all this system seems to be missing. I have been going on divergence between price and CCI, as well as the macd......Please let me know thank you Antny

--- 帖子 #850 ---
I'm not trading right now. Was moving to a different country. Elite is a good system - you can make profit if you have discipline. As for exits, hard to tell. Original set up to exit when it crosses back. I exit using price actions and support/resistance. It's hard to explain - I hope you have some knowledge of it. Good luck

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Thank you for responding, I still would like the setup instructions?? I am not able to find them. Good luck on your move. Take care.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
I've read the entire thread, and I couldn't find the entry rules (I found some 'ideas' on exit). Can someone point me to the post that I must have missed for the rules? thanks.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
the cerater of the strategy deleted the rules, he closed the topic 'cuz he started his own website. Original rules for entry are - when SMA 3 crosses 34, as far as I remember. Nothing fancy - very simple. he suggests to entry if a crossing candle is small. not HUGE. SL=15pips. timeframe=15min. I guess, this is original setting. ps: I modified it to trade for 1 and 5 min, to catch short and long term trades. I hope it is helpful.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
That's how I remember it too!

--- 帖子 #855 ---
You wouldn't know his website URL would you? I'd like to see his orginal rules.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
When I overhauled my trading system, I also went back and looked over some other successful trading strategies in the past. Also, came across "Waterflame's" system and took some of his strategies and integrated them into mine. His system is a easy and good one. PS: Good to hear from you Flamenco143. I'm so busy lately for job search that I have barely time for anything else. But, good to see you back in action. D.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Wondering wether the crosses should only be traded in accordance with slightly higher timeframe CCI's to make sure your only with the trend, unless your getting a clear bounce off a trendline and then get a crossover the 34 sma. cja's mtf cci bars with the CCI settings to 21 or 34 might work well to help trade with the rest of the trend? If i get any luck with this i'll keep this thread posted. Maybe people should resurrect this thread and find a way to trade this method properly to filter out some of the fake out's?

--- 帖子 #858 ---
it can be found here: http://www.ircforex.com/trading-syst...sophistication

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I like the use of larger time frames over small ones, I don't have time to wade through the thread, could you give me a rundown of the latest rules? I will attempt this. Or are the original rules as found by nondisclosure00 the rules that should be followed today.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Does this indicator repaints?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
try to use it how it is.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
When are you people going to get it that ALL FRIGGEN INDICATORS REPAINT ON THE ACTIVE CANDLE............

--- 帖子 #304 ---
aaah ! waterflame ! how well have you done with this in the last two years ? profitable...?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
its running, thanks, how about you?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
never used your system. not sure of the rules. if i understand correctly, you plot a 3 simple ma and a 34 simple ma. you buy when 3 crosses the 34 above, and vice versa ? but it doesnt really show much promise to me , many false trades... i have done very well this year with my own methods. regards

--- 帖子 #307 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=85226 look at this, and read the thread.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
This thread is dead but the Elite method works especially with Renko to catch big moves.
