I am editing the Original Post to make room for the Improved Version of this system. I was having issues with the 1 hr method because......although it can be profitable, it can also be risky. Like everything else in life, we all want the best. To get the best, we must try to improve whatever it is we are striving for. In saying that, I stayed up til the wee hours of the morning, and figured out that it may be better to use a 5 minute chart with this method, along with a "No Channel Required to cross", just as long as the new candle is beyond the 3MAs. I hope I do not upset anyone who has put in alot of work with the EAs. Thank you for your hard work. Hey, if this system can be improved, why not. And anyone out there with any ideas, please share. Lets improve this thing to its maximum potentail. New method starts at Message #88 All EAs before this message are for the 1 Hour method. Below the line is the Original Post -------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------- ORIGINAL POST: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1200507422 I am posting the system in hopes that I might find a programmer for it. This system may be in these Forums already, if so, please let me know. I would love to exchange ideas. Many thanks to Nicotina, the creator of another system that has shown me a way to trade this system. GBPJPY 1 HOUR CHART . Use Candlesticks 2 Moving Averages (Same Color) 13 Simple MA (High) 13 Simple MA (Low) 1 Moving Average (Different Color) 100 Exponential (Close) I will post a picture for the entry point. The Exit is 100/100. 100pips TP (Take Profit) 100pips SL (Stop Loss) I am currently back-testing for 2007. I will post my results as soon as I have it. I have only tried it on the GBPJPY because of its volatility.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
..looks neat. What constitutes an entry?....open and close of candle beyond the MA?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Yes. As soon as the candle closes outside the 2 13MA lines.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yes, I am also interested here... Please explain why and when you enter and exit. Good Luck with this system

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Not sure what explaination you are looking for. Just know that the 100MA is the momentum signal. Entry point is when the last candle closes beyond the 13MAs yellow lines. Exit: Take profit of 100 pips / Stop loss is 100 pips

--- 帖子 #6 ---
The last candle? Do you mean the first candle that closes below the 13 SMA lines? JR2007, do you agree with entry points?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks, good luck with the testing - will be interesting to see how it performs during ranging periods.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Sorry men, but for me, this system give so much bad signal..

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I posted today's chart with the indicators, timeframe and currency pair listed and it seems to work. This chart proves your statement as incorrect. I just can't grasp why new traders come to postings, state they do not work and fail to explain why then disappear.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Sorry, I meant the next candle. It is more of a conviction for its direction.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
JR2007, I changed the pic of chart on post 6, see if this is what you describe as the next candle after the close of the first below the 13 ma. Thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes, exactly. If you notice on my picture, I took a different approach on long candles. Only the long candles when they close long.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Is this correct... Entry is based on candle close Candle close &lt; 13 SMA LOW &amp; 100 EMA = SHORT Candle close &gt; 13 SMA HIGH &amp; 100 EMA = LONG Take profit = 100 pips Stop loss = 100 pips If you have an exisiting trade still open, would you add another trade if all the critera is met or do you have only 1 trade open at a time that would need to be closed before the next trade can be placed? Does the price need to close in channel for re-entry in the same direction? Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Good question. I never ran into that situation. But then I never looked into that situation, also maybe because I stick to one trade. Hey if one trade can bring me 100 pips for the day, I'm happy. On the Long, or Short, do not forget about the 100EMA. This is your Long/Short Signal. Just remember, the criteria for an exit is: 100pip take profit / 100pip stop loss

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Good Post JR2007 Thanks for answering my questions

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Your Welcome.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I think see bad signal in 1-4,8,9,11.. but i can be wrong of course

--- 帖子 #19 ---
1-4,8,9,11.. ???? I do not understand. What are these numbers?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Can you be more specific? Read Jr2007's specific trading instructions. Your the only one that apparently disagrees and you do not stipulate why. This is not fair to the poster. I have absolutely no idea what those numbers mean? Can't be your arrows, you only have 10 and he states the number 11.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
very cool your break-out system, in combination with the trigger-lines it looks like this:

--- 帖子 #22 ---
days

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I use only the GBPJPY 1hr Chart

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I think he means month of Jan and days 1-4, 8,9,11 of Jan, not perfect days trading with this method. But from quick visual test this strategy looks good. Will research further. Thanks for sharing TT.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
yes, month 1 and days 4,8.. in gbpjpy 1h

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Ok days , I use 1 hour chart ONLY. A quick look at Jan days looked good to me.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I used this system on GBP/USD and set the take profit at 50 and SL likewise and made 54 pips. Looks like using 50 on that pair may work well.. and of course, you can trail the SL on a particularly "hot" day. Nice system so far.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Maksi86 was not looking closely at your instructions. The rest of us were good students

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Cool, I'll have to check this out. Thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Interesting. I looked at something very similar about 7 months ago, but it was based on a 25 SMA off high and low. With GBPJPY I was looking at 100, 200, and 300 levels on the SMAs for take profit levels. SL was opposite side of the channel. The wins could be spectacular but the weakness was a direct result of the large volitility of this pair and the high possibility of being stopped out in a sideways market. It never occured to me to use something like a 100 MA variant as a filter (amazes me how small my mind is sometimes!). I also kept trying to find a way of catching the snap back to the trigger SMA (another unwise move). I'm at work right now and can't fiddle with any charts -- but I'm eager to look at this when I get back home. I do have a question. According to the rules as posted, if price jumped up above the 100 EMA, and the next bar opened still crossed, I want to confirm, you would take that trade even if the the channel had not crossed. Is that correct? As I said, I can't take a proper look right now, but I suspect we'll find some big retracing moves that qualify for a signal, but are really far from the 13 SMA, and you'll get caught as the price falls before the trend continues. It may just be "grist for the mill"... the inevitable price you'll have to pay with this system, but I'm throwing it out for everyone to comment on. Great little system. I'm betting it is a long term winner, and something that will easily lend itself to working in an EA.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
IMO, I would rather stay away from a candle (only) crossing the 100MA. The 13/13 channel is the main driver.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thanks for sharing! I will give this a go next week for sure

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks for posting this JR. I will quickly come up with a custom indicator first. Then later depending upon how successfully the system progresses , I will add alert/convert to EA.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Cool, I would greatly appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hello, It is a very easy EA to code. However 2007 win/loss is around 1:1. You may need to think about other filter etc. Settings: Stoploss/Takeprofit - no need to explain Riskpertrade - % risk per trade Trades - number of signals/trades you are willing to take MA1 - the channel SMA as per rule MA2 - the filter EMA as per rule Enjoy~~

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I'm sorry, but is this an EA for another system?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
2007 Manual Test Results 14,300 pips - for the entire year of 2007. August was the best month with 2100 pips May was the worst month with 500 pips

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hello jr2007, This is the EA for the system you described. you can use the visual mode to check it validity. It is just my program writing style so it all looks similar. I forgot to include account calculations though and forgot to remove demo restriction. So here is the new EA: more setting: Mini- if you are using mini account Microlots - if your broker support microlots Enjoy~~

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Wow, thank you very much. I will Demo it, and get back to you.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Did you account for the spread in your test results? Thanks

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I know, huh!? Spread, a lot for gbpjpy. Probably took away 1,500 pips or so. Puppy, give us mq4 file too.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Would you wait for the 13 SMA channel to cross the 100 EMA if the market changes direction from bearish to bullish before entering a trade going long or does the close of a candle just need to be greater than all the moving averages? Did you exclude the spread for your 2007 results? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
The EA I coded just use the candle above all MA for going long when it changes from bearish to bullish bias - so if jr2007 use it the other way you describe above, then I have to change the code. So tell me which one later and I can change the code if necessary. ^^

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Puppy, How does the EA trade the re-entries assuming price does not cross to the other side? Does it need to close inside the channel for the next short if price is in a down trend for example? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hey Puppy, Can you either release the source code or add a fixed lot parameter to your EA?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
No, but I will add it and retest within the few days.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
yes, wait for channel to cross, and no I did not include spread.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Sounds like you have it right, but just to detail it...When I am manually trading, I make sure the body Open/Close is on the outside of the 13MA Channel. the wicks are not incuded.

--- 帖子 #49 ---

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks for posting this. I knew there was something out there. A bit different though, but similar.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
The EA hit at the right moment. Beautiful, so far. Thank you puppy. Will let you know how it goes.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Did you just short GBP/JPY based on this system? I did. Wish me luck.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
yes, with the EA

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I'm logging out, and will see tomorrow morning how well it did. I put a 100 pip trailing stop on it. Good luck to you as well.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thank you, Good Luck

--- 帖子 #56 ---
here's a quick shot at the ea and a companion indicator .... buys as jr suggests, if both the open and close are above the 13 high sma and 100 ema it buys the following open..... converse is true for sell..... the indicator should paint all potential buy bars blue and potential sell bars red.... if you see a blue bar fall clean thru both the 13's and the hundred it might first appear it should not be blue..... and the reverse situation occurs occasionally with red bars..... the bars are painted correctly..... it's just a painful reminder that the prior bar can be a fake out.... win some loose some.... trailing stop is included, leave it set at 0 if ya not interested or set to suit if ya are..... the ea contains the standard moneymangement code often seen..... set mm to true and adjust the maximum risk to what your prepared to loose.... if mm is set to false, you can control lot size using lots input..... maxlong orders is for more than 1 long order at a time ..... same goes for maxshorts...... maxlots is just to keep lots under control.... several possible improvements come to mind..... holler if your interested..... if ya run a backtest and plot the trades on a chart you can put the painted jr2007 on it to double check accuracy...... as seen in the included chart.... also note the multiple longs, i had the maxlongs set to 5.......h

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hey guys, we're supposed to go short on the candle that closed below the channel (6:00 gmt), ema still above...? right? regards

--- 帖子 #58 ---
didn't work out so well for me. I got stopped out (-100 pips).

--- 帖子 #59 ---
it's eaten my stoploss also, this hungry volatile animal ) surely not smart to take a trade before or in the period of news coming out

--- 帖子 #60 ---
First, thank you for your efforts Puppy and Hayseed. Second, sorry for the long post... BUT... I hope we can get one or more of these things working exactly right with maybe a couple of user selectable filters. But first we need to get the basics working correctly. jr2007 has pretty clearly stated now that we take no trades unless the channel has crossed the 100EMA. Puppy, I believe your EA came out before this instruction was clear. I also think that jr2007 has clarified that the entire body of a qualifying bar/candle must be outside of the channel, and I haven't seen anything indicating that is included in your EA's logic. Hayseed, you indicate your EA will account for these additional conditions, but I see that your indicator is showing a long trade should have entered at 0900GMT today, but the channel never even partially crossed the 100EMA. Your indicator does seem to account for the body outside the channel rule. Nevertheless, that 0900 long trigger would have been a killer, so it causes me to question if your EA will actually account for this requirement. I doubt I'll have time today to look inside your indicator and EA to check the logic before I go to work, but I will try to carve out the time to do so. Improvements, options... I am looking at the AC standard indicator with the 5,3,3 stochastic overlayed as a possible filter. I've been watching this as a main trigger in another system called "OZfx System" here on FF. I'm not ready to make any recommendations, but it looks like we might be able to use these overlayed indicators as a filter allowing us to open trades on any close outside the channel, with a TP when the AC color turns against the position. I'm also considering looking at ATR as a possible TP/SL modifier for the system so that it might self-calculate and adjust for different market conditions and other forex pairs. I'm borrowing that thought from other threads too, as usually somewhere in the evolution of EAs this inevitably pops up... I know we are early on but I thought I'd give you programmers some food for thought. So, we still don't seem to have an EA that fully complies with all the rules as jr2007 has put them to us. I hope this is easily rectified, because I am eager to see this system fully functioning, and check out some other concepts with it. Thanks again for your work to date.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
hey qman..... what pair and time frame had the signal and i'll double check.... i'll reread the rules but my understanding was the the channel crossing the 100 was not a requirement..... just that both the prior close and open had to be above both the 13 and 100 to buy and converse for sell..... filters might help but lookin deep at the true manner in which the signals are being derived leads me wonder ..... other than adjusting the trend ma's, 100, value..... it's the nature in which the signals are being derived that leads me to believe my spiderman and superman ea's could help posiibly more than filters..... just a thought if anyone is interested.....h

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I was looking at GBPJPY on a 1 hour timeframe. 0900GMT. We asked throughout the day yesterday about does the channel have to cross the 100EMA for valid signals and finally got an answere late yesterday... It was just a few posts back. So it is not in the original post unless jr2007 has edited that. Spiderman and Superman EAs... you've got my attention. I'm not sure if this thread would be the right place to detail them as it will likely distract from the main subject. If you are interested in sharing, and I mean by that, detailing the logic behind them, I'm sure you would have some community interest. Perhaps on the Metatrader Form on FF. You could open a thread there and post a link in here to get us there. Sounds like this would have potential applicability beyond just this system. If you are not comfy sharing all that but want some feedback you could PM me, and after reviewing it in whatever detail you want there I could help you decide if and where you might post... not that you need me for that in any capacity. I'm a newby still. I'm learning still. I'm curious still. And I'm still not where I want to be in my own coding capabilities. I'm always happy and eager when someone shares something new. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
First of all thanks to everyone contributing to this thread. Especially thank you to puppy, and Hayseed for developing the EAs. I have a few questions about the EAs. Can you edit the EAs so it does not enter a trade unless both 13MA cross to the other side? Also, I am posting 2 pictures. If both these scenarios happen, will the EA put me in a trade? If so, is there any way to keep the EA from getting into a trade unless its the first candle outside the 13MA lines/100MA? Another words, if for whatever reason the trade is not entered on the first candle outside the lines, do not enter a trade. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1200594091

--- 帖子 #64 ---
hey jr.... we should be able to code just about anything...... the ea presented was based my understanding of your rules would not placed a trade in picture 1, if by entry point you mean that would be the bar the actual trade was placed..... due to the fact the prior bars open was clearly below the 13highma..... it would have placed a trade the next bar from the arrow..... signal bar first, then next bar opens the trade..... in reguards to the second picture, yes it's possibly could have made that trade..... due to the fact the prior bar candle was above both the 13highma and the 100ma.... for instance is a long just closed for the 100pip profit rule, another would have opened up.... daisy chain style..... i used your post 1, 5 and post 14 for the rules..... //----------------- If so, is there any way to keep the EA from getting into a trade unless its the first candle outside the 13MA lines/100MA? Another words, if for whatever reason the trade is not entered on the first candle outside the lines, do not enter a trade. //--------------------- that would be coded as a cross and not close above , and lookin back closely at your posts i see that has been your intention all along...... and yes absolutely, we can code that in short order..... h

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Actually, picture 1 is a perfect scenario for an entry (Long). Both 13MAs have crossed the 100ma. and the first candle developed outside the 13MA channel. On the second, picture, A second trade should not open up until the next opportunity. This is not a good scenario because of the channels not crossing at an oppotune time. Also, the system is after 100 pips, it can get dangerous going after more, unless you are in front of your computer.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Maybe I explained it wrong. I deeply apologize for the confusement. Entry should be the first developing candle outside the 13MA Channel/100MA Short/Long. Once again, I apologize. Please disregard any other post regarding this point.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
hey jr...... ok, summing up here a bit..... for longs, the 13 channel has to be above the 100, the entire channel above.... correct?.... now think about the candle you have marked as entry point..... yes , it clearly formed above the channel, but you won't know for sure until it's completely formed and that hour is over.... at any second it could fall below the 13 ..... so once the first candle developed outside the 13MA channel, the one you have labeled, your earliest entry point would be the open of the following bar...... correct?....h

--- 帖子 #68 ---
For Longs, or Shorts, YES....the entire 13 channel has to completely cross the 100. The first developing candle outside the channel, not the candle coming from inside the channel, the first candle appearing/developing outside the channel. Even if that candle goes back into the channel. So long as it is the first candle started outside the channel.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
hey qman.... yes your likely correct , it would be best to stay on jr's subject..... breifly, the superman and spiderman are 2 parts of the greed ea..... the greed is truely huge and unlike anything on the net..... the superman part could help here..... once we get clear on the rules , i'll post examples of how it would help..... h

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Superman/Spiderman...????

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Ok, here's my crack at an EA. Buy: Bar is long Open is above the High 13 SMA. Previous bar's Open is below the High 13 SMA Open is above the 100 XMA High 13 SMA is greater than the 100 XMA Low 13 SMA is greater than the 100 XMA TP = 100 SL = 100 Sell: Bar is Short Open is below the Low 13 SMA Previous bar's Open is above the Low 13 SMA Open is below the 100 XMA High 13 SMA is less than the 100 XMA Low 13 SMA is less than the 100 XMA TP = 100 SL = 100

--- 帖子 #72 ---
The more you hint, the more curious I will get. I'm looking forward to it.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thank you, It looks good, Will Demo, and get back to you, Thank you

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Question about re-entry. Will it re-enter a trade? If so, when? Immediately, or when the next opportunity comes (the next first candle outside the 13MA)?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
It reenters only if the previous candle was partially inside the channel.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Cool, thank you.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hello everyone, Here is the updated EA when channel is above/below 100SMA before the trade - the result is improved. I have seen other people also doing the EA so hopefully it would be my last one ^^ 2007 backtest result with metaquote data: Total trade 177, Profitable 93, Loss 84 (My computer is too slow to backtest, happy testing esp compare with different EAs) Enjoy~~

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Puppy, it's the 100 XMA (exponential moving average)

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Jr Great system, I have one suggestion on the filtering. I post one indicator, just see if this is not a better filter than the 100 MA. JUst add it with default settings, your opinion will be appreciated. Regards

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Unfortuneatly I do not have the mq4 file for indicator in the previous post

--- 帖子 #81 ---
So far I like what I see. Will test it next few days for comparison. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hey jr..... ok, rewrote the indicator to place arrows on the signals.... check this if ya have the time to verify .... each arrow is numbered so we can all relate.... some times it was a very close call but all trades looked valid to me....... in this image there were no valid sells.... and nice work ronald, looks good.....h

--- 帖子 #83 ---
ok changed the code to restrict trades from being made unless the 13 was on the proper side of the 100.... that reduces trades somewhat.... changed the indicator to paint arrows on potential new buys or sells only.... keep in mind thus far we spoken of &gt; and &lt; with no mentioned of = .... as seen in the picture the reason why no trade was entered on the second arrow was because the 13 low sma = the 100 ema..... which of course is not the same as &gt; , so no trade was entered..... otherwise ea is pretty much the same.... again included the maxlongs and maxshorts for those whom might want multiple open poistions..... leave the setting at 1 for single entrys...... and setting mm to true and adjusting your risk turns the lot size over to the commonly seen moneymanagement code...... if after running a test and plotting the trades on the chart , you can apply the indicator to verify....... i compared ronald's version which actually pays a couple bucks more than mine..... after looking at his code to see why, it appears the difference is mainly due to how the stoploss is calculated which equates to a few extra dollars in his pockets.... nice work ronald......h

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks, I actually used 100EMA in the code. it is just typing error here. hehe. Enjoy

--- 帖子 #85 ---
These entry points look fine, but if you are in a trade and another entry point comes around, you must be out of the trade first. Another words, if you got into number 1 entry point, and you have not reached the 100pip target, and you come upon entry 2, or even 3, or 4, then all these other entry points are ignored.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I like this system a lot, easy to understand &amp; seems reliable! You say trade this pair on the GJ, ok, but what about other pairs? Have you only looked at the GJ or have you looked at others and ruled them out. Obviously other pairs might not have stops/profits of 100 pips. If not I will have a ponder thru all the pairs and see. First one that springs to mind is the E/J. Also, what do you do when the 100ema is in the middle of the 13 sma channel? Do you still take trades or wait for the channels to be above/below the 100 ema? Thanks Bob

--- 帖子 #87 ---
hey jr.... yep, leaving maxlongs and maxshorts set to "1", trades 1 long at a time..... and of course if it's set on 2 it will take 2 and so on..... i have the ea running live on the eurusd, audusd , on the 15, 30 and 60 minute charts.... chose those due to the fact they appeared the absolute worst to apply it to...... will ad more sunday night..... h

--- 帖子 #88 ---
New Method - Please read Original Post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=65439 --------------------------------------------------------------- I need some changes made on the EAs due to the fact that I was up until the wee hours of the morning trying to figure out a better way. In doing that I stumbled upon a possible gold mine. Changes: I need the EAs made for 5 Minute Chart. Same principal, only changes are the time frame, and no waiting for the channel to cross....so long as the candle is clearing all three MAs. No extra entrys until the open one is closed. Guys/Gals, check it out.......Niiiice.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
jr, This is interesting, but is certainly a different method. It should be made clear that there are now two systems being discussed. A short and a longer term. I suggest you edit your original post. In that first post you should point out there are now 2 systems. Go ahead and update your original system with the rules as we have flushed them out. Then put the rules for this new system. Point out that the new short timeframe system is not currently programmed in neither the indicator nor the EA. I would also suggest you place a link to your original post of this new system back there stating something like, "Discussion of the shorter timeframe system does not begin until:" If you don't do this there will be lots of confusion... I PROMISE. And we'll all spend countless hours explaining over and over what is going on, even as it is evolving. If you keep the original posting (or one as close to it as possible)as a summary for the whole thread, whenever a question comes up we can all just direct the questioner to that post. My 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Done, Thank you

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Please Confirm: BUY: Current Candle closes Long Current Candle opens completely above the HIGH 13 MA Current Candle above the 100 XMA Previous candle was partially/wholly inside the channel. SELL: Current Candle closes Short Current Candle opens completely below the LOW 13 MA Current Candle below the 100 XMA Previous Candle was partially/wholly inside the channel.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Looks right. Also, I am looking at possible profit target. Need to get an average in order to determine. For now, 100/50 looks to be the better option. 100tp/50sl. Although, 100tp needs to be evaluated.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Here is my version of this new 5 min system. Just make sure you put it on a 5 min chart.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thank you, will Demo.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I placed the EA on a 5 minute chart. No action was taken at the first candle outside the channel. Did I need to do something to the EA?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi jr2007! Very intersting that you are using your wave also on other timeframes now. If you don't mind you may also check out the very similar concept developed by R. Horner called the "Horner wave" which works with the 34ema in all timeframes. http://www.fxfisherman.com/forums/fo...html#post13352 http://www.ez2tradesoftware.com/automate.html Very funny to find out for me: She also has the painted bars in her setup: " Another powerful visual indicator is the color coded candles that tell you whether prices are on the strong or weak side of the Wave."

--- 帖子 #97 ---
thats pretty good, thanks for posting. The bottom link has pictures.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Will test to see performance next week

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Default settings should work. However, I realized that the EA didn't open sell orders. This has been fixed now. Also, please note that the previous candle's open needed to be inside the channel. If you think something is wrong, take a screenshot and show it to me. (do point out the missed signal.) I'll work from there.

Ronald have downloaded to MT4 but it will not open cheers

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Did you restart metatrader? Is the file in the right folder? Was it compiled?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Ronald Yes to all 3 so I deleted and reloaded etc still no joy

--- 帖子 #103 ---
You're saying it doesn't show up in metatader under "Expert advisor"? File wasn't compiled. File in wrong folder Not Metatrader Broker doesn't allow EAs ( I know some don't) I honestly can't think of anything else...

Ronald I have downloaded numerous files to MT4 with no problems yes, your file is under custom indicators when I try and open it nothing comes up you mentioned about compiling, what do I have to do? cheers

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Just browsing the board and thought I'd lend a hand... If you can see his expert advisor listed under the custom indicators then you have download it to the wrong folder. **YOU WILL NEVER SEE AN EA LISTED AS AN INDICATOR** Indicators are to be placed in the "C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators" folder whereas EA's have to be placed in the " C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts " folder .

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Please illustrate the modification using a 5 min chart? For example there were occassions when then the candles cleared the channel but took a couple of candles before going above or below 100 XmA. Would you take such a trade? Thanks

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thank you Bunjow, I never really did have any patience for people who don't read the instructions that come with the platform. Just to clarify everyone. Expert Advisors go in the "Experts" folder Custom Indicators go in the "Indicators" folder

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Thanks for that Ronald, if you didnt have patience why bothering posting in the first place, cheers I have downloaded over 30/40 different indicators and have never had a problem apart from your one anyway I dont wish to take up anymore of your "absolute valuable time" on time wasters, like me

--- 帖子 #109 ---
update..... jr2007 has now open quite a few positions on differing time frames and pairs..... had put it on the 2 that in my opinion truely had the highest chance of failure, see my prior post, but just as you would expect those now appear the best..... typical..... of tremendous importance would close inspection of the signals themselves, see the arrows.... in post 61 i mentioned , the nature in which the signals are derived, .... some worthwhile changes are now obvious.....h

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Loaded EA last night and had a couple of good trades. Woke up this morning to find a lot of good trades. Question. Can EA be programmed to move stop? Say at 50 pip bring to be +5 then trail. I'm very new at this. System seems very simple but accurate. Thanks to jr2007 and Ronald for your work. Mombone

--- 帖子 #111 ---
What do you mean? It sounds like you want to start a 45 pip trailing stop. In that case, just set the trailing stop to 45. It's already built in.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hey RR Thanks for response. Can EA start trailing stop at 50 pip profit or would I have to set trailing stop from start? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Just set the trailing stop to 50 and the stoploss to 50...The trailing portion shouldn't enable itself until breakeven.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hey Ron, good morning from San Diego, Ca. Was out of town for the weekend, so I did not have a chance to demo yesterday. I woke up this morning and placed the EA on a 5 min. GBP/JPY. When the trigger candle opened up, no trade was triggered. All signals were met for a short, but no trade was entered. Will the trade enter pending the brokers commision? Sorry, still having trouble with the EA.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
jr well researched to change TF from 1 hr to 5min I got +120 from g/j today thanks

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Your welcome, lets just hope this is not a seasonal moment. I need to backtest to check its profitability.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I have backtested for the last 7 months and as long as you stick to the rules and the system with proper money management you will without doubt do very well with this one confirmation I do have before placing a trade on the 5min is to take a look at the 1hr and if the RSI is in the same direction then I will take it

--- 帖子 #118 ---
A seven month backtest is not a slam dunk. There is risk, so don't fool yourself.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thank you for the testing. Now, I don't see where the 1hr chart helps the 5min. The 100ma is your longer term indicator. Also, what settings is the RSI at. Please explain, it may help the system. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
For 5min charts, still not bad.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1200944917 A short entry should have occurred here. No Action was taken with the latest EA.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
hey jr.... reasonably sure i know the why the signal did not place a trade but just to make sure, exactly what was the time of the missing trade.....h

--- 帖子 #123 ---
hey jr..... ok, scratch my prior request..... it is as i suspected..... it's ronalds code..... noticed it when i ran compartion backtests between his version and mine..... he has included on both the buy and sell sides a condition that relates to the open vs the close which is in contradiction to your rules, or at least my understanding of them......h

--- 帖子 #124 ---
On chart time: 2008.01.21 18:50

--- 帖子 #125 ---
ok, that would make sense, because they are not entering by my rules. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hayseed, I am demoing the EA you placed in this thread with a picture of painted bars. It seemed to enter as per rules for the 5min. strategy. I am crossing my fingers that this is what I need. Will demo all day until tomorrow. Thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
What about a backtest using M1 data? Sure, it won't be perfect based on M5, but it will tell you if the majority of signals are where they need to be (by eyeballing the chart.)

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hmm.....will try, thanks.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Real quick: Using M1 is absolutely critical to getting accurate results..... Anything lower than 90% MQ will be unreliable.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
ok, thanks.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
hey tdion..... all my back tests are derived from minute data, sometimes as much as 4 years worth.... the platform will first take the minute data and build accurate higher time frame files, then use that higher time frame file from then on...... your higher time frame data file is as pure as your 1 minute data , providing you never log on with that platform...... for that reason all my back testing is done in platforms that never ever connect to a server...... i'm reasonably sure you knew that but some might not..... hey jr..... i've had the ea running for several days and all trades seem to go as planned..... it's opened and closed many trades and all trades have opened properly, as per your first post picture..... each has luckily closed with 100 pips gain...... of course those gains could have been losses..........h

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Not true... Suppose you have M1 data back to 2005.... then D1 data back to 2001.... The backtester will use D1 through 2005 and then switch to M1.... so your 2001-2005 is inaccurate. You are correct in M1 providing higher granularity of price action during simulation, because at higher timeframes (D1) the backtester simply "guesses" what price occured when. This is a backtesting fallacy.... for true 90% MQ, you need M1 data....

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I agree that it could easily go south. On your trades the past few days, are you telling me they all closed with 100 pips? If not, what are trades looking like? In percentage wise anyway?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
What are you using on the 5min charts? can u post a picture please and explaination of the system... thanks Peace out

--- 帖子 #135 ---
hey tdion..... perhaps i was not clear..... my platforms used in testing never see a server..... there is no chance of any data being added that is not added by me..... i start with 4 years of minute data only.... then using the period converter i convert the minute data to 5 minute data..... then using the period converter again i the minute data to 15 minute.... and so on and so on..... on every currency pair....... if you looked in the history file you would see my first 1 minute bar as 4/16/2004..... and if you looked at each of the higher time frames you would see they start the exact same day..... nothing predates the earilest minute bar...... i can not back test anything on these minute built platforms prior to 4/16/04 , there is no data..... for any timeframe...... h

--- 帖子 #136 ---
can you repost the correct EA. I'm using the one from Ronald Raygun and I'm having fantastic results from yesterday, about 20% so far. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Nice.... that is my approach too....

--- 帖子 #138 ---
hey jr.....every trade closed with 100 pip gain..... that was luck..... the picture posted friday shows some..... many more trades triggered sunday night..... i have mine set for 5 open trades at a time.... that allows for 5 open trades per symbol and per time frame.... so placeing the ea on 2 different pairs and 2 different time frames allows for 10 potential open orders each way..... i included a magicnumber generator to keep all trades seperate..... however, before we start toasting to victory, we should note in no way did we maximised the trades potential..... true, they closed with 100 pips but all could have easily gone on for 200 and still countin....... maximising the trades potential is not always greed, sometimes it's the key to longevity..... we might need to doll up the exit code some......h

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hayseed, looking back at this chart, I have a few questions. First, I see several trades opened at one time. If so, there should only be one trade opened at one time. Next, I am posting a picture to show my entry points, along with blue boxes to show areas that should not enter trades. Just to Reiterate. Another words, no opened trades until "The next opportunity". Also, since the system is using 5min. chart, Channel does not need to cross. The 100MA still holds as the directional MA. I am posting this because I used your EA today, And I was impressed, up to the point that it was putting me into a trade as soon as I placed it on the 5min chart. Is there any way you can make adjustments to this EA? http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1200958715

--- 帖子 #140 ---
hey jr..... the original ea, jr2007, uploaded in post 56 should follow your earilest rules and also the picture you just provided..... the second ea , posted later, was when the rules were changed so i changed the name.... jr2007 ea..... i'm using the first version , post 56..... the settings , 'maxlongorders' and 'maxshortorders' are set at 1..... it should only open 1 at a time unless you change it..... all my trades opened and closed correctly on all pairs and timeframes, however i was not using the 5 minute...... my timeframes were 15, 30 and hour...... all jr2007 open trades have closed and i have pulled the ea...... using ea's can be quite dicey at times.....i've mentioned several times about possible improvements...... look close at the picture and those improvements should be obvious..... rewriting ea now.....h

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Ok, just to get this straight, in your picture, you have 5 green arrows, and 5 red arrows. From left to right, lets go with Green Arrow 1. Lets say we entered a trade and we get to Green Arrow 2, and 100 pips have not reached. A second trade will not open? And once the profit target of 100 pips is reached, will it automatically enter a trade, or will it wait for the next Entry Point? I need it to wait for the next Entry Point. Also, in your picture you seem to have 3 open trades at one time. I need only one trade opened at one time until it hits the TP/SL.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Sorry, I just went back and read this. You are way ahead of the game. Very good. But, is there anyway you can adjust things for me from post #141 Also, I need it for the 5min TF

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hey Hayseed, don't mean to be a pain, but, in using jr2007ea version for the 5min strategy, It did not enter a trade when it should have. Please view picture http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1200965914

--- 帖子 #144 ---
hey jr..... the arrows will mark every possible entry so many possible entrys will be passed by due to us being in a trade..... unless we all enter on the exact same signal each time our entrys will vary..... i have confused the situation by posting charts showing tests run that placed multiple orders, i will refrain from doing that in the future..... however, i can assure you the end result here will not be single trades but rather multiple trades possibly as many as 5 , but as you say, that is for another day..... i haven't read the entire thread so not familar with the 5 minute deal,..... are there differing rules , in any way at all, for it than those seen in your first post...... any changes no matter how small..... deals like this take some time to iron out and it's worth our time to make sure it works as planned.... sometimes i might write an ea several dozen times before satisfaction..... let me know about the rules, will change what needs be......h

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thank you very much. Here are the changes. Using the 5min Chart 100MA still used as the Major Directional signal. No need for channel to cross. So long as the opening of a new candle is beyond all 3 MAs. Take profit is:100 Stop Loss is:50

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hey guys, hope you don't mind me following the thread on the quiet, as I like the simplicity of jr's system. For me, if it's simple, I wanna know aboudit. In my "?vast?" experience, it's the simple set-ups that show the better chance of profit. Now, I'm not a great believer in EA's, but, that being said, I thought I would try this EA out, but nothing!! Wassup? Dave

--- 帖子 #147 ---
where to download the trigger-lines indi?? from mini008

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Your 5 minute 13 SMA channel strategy appears very good and is identical with signals from the X50 5 minute also on this forum? Check it out.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
In terms of the goal, I am sure we are all after the same thing. In terms of similarity, I don't see it. Regardless, we're all here after the same goal. Success, and Profit. More power to all of us.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
hey jr..... take a look and see if this is close..... each arrow is marking the entry bar, so we would buy/sell on that bars open..... the actual signal bar in each case would be the prior bar..... if you look close, first the signal candle forms above all ma's then we buy next open..... on the sell side first the candle forms below all ma's and then we sell the next open..... the actual buy and sell bars are marked with arrows...... pay special attention to sell bars 3 and 4..... if you look close you'll see the prior bar fullfilled all rules..... that being, a candle formed below all ma's ..... when you mentioned, '' long as the opening of a new candle is beyond all 3 MAs."....... does the close of that new candle also have to be beyond all 3 ma's......h

--- 帖子 #151 ---
They are not identical in any sense. They appear to give entry signals at about if not exactly same candle. That was my point. Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
No, the bar before. open on the bar left of the arrow.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
oh sorry, I misunderstood.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
jr RSI setting at 13, seems to help when it crosses on 1 hr question: does it matter if the 100 is above the 13 ma`s to go long or do the 13 ma`s have to be above the 100 or it doesnt matter as long as the market is above all 3 cheers

--- 帖子 #155 ---
hey jr..... ok we can do it.... it will however not work in your favor due to the large number of whiplashes.... rather than post it i'll pm it to you.... that way you can give it a test drive, and post if it proves satisfactory..... if ya don't mind me askin, what is the reason for moving your entry back one bar from your original rules..... all markets are lookin wild today, so might take me a minute.....h

--- 帖子 #156 ---
This is "only" for the 5min strategy

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hey JR and Hayseed, Am new to this game and have been following this thread. I tried RR's EA and had good results Sunday night but got killed on Monday. I inserted this LSAR indicator and it appears to give good early signals. When you first load it signals are barely visible. Change font on indicator to 5. As I said I am new and don't know if this repaints or not. Could it be possible to work this into EA. Thanks for all your effort, Mombone

--- 帖子 #158 ---
hey jr.... apparently we can't pm attachment's so the ea is the link provided in the pm.... it open trades with pretty much your one and only one rule per post 145 ..... that rule being only one trade a time and enter the exact bar when the open clears all 3 ma's.....h

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thank you very much. Will give it a go.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks for the idea. Someone posted that Indicator some time ago. It is interesting, and I have been trying it with about the same result. I am not shooting it down though. I just do not want to sway away from my original indicators just yet. Its funny, when you get a project going, time just starts to fly. I hope to get good results demoing with my original Indicators, then adding, or changing things. I even like the idea Hayseed is doing. Multiple symbols at one time. Anyway, If, anyone has come up with a winning method with this system, and I mean winning, please share.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
jr did you see the above post? maybe your too busy to answer or maybe I`m stupid even asking you cheers ps: I have added another 2 indicators to your system, brings down the losses by half

--- 帖子 #162 ---
can you post your indicators?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
jr yeah no problem once you have (if thats alright) answered my post cheers

--- 帖子 #164 ---
sorry there is another indicator.. this confirms the entry of the trade and cuts down most false signals

--- 帖子 #165 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201027317 Hayseed, thank you for all your help. Also, thank you to RonaldRaygun for your contribution. And everyone else who has contributed to this thread. RonaldRaygun, I ran your EA last night with very good success. I just seem to remember that I had an issue with the shorts….can’t remember. Also, the Entry point is one candle off. Anyway, I will continue to demo. I am looking at a possible exit strategy for when a trade goes South. I’m stealing the idea from another thread, just can’t remember what thread it was. Ok, I saw a system where two indicators were used. When they both met the criteria, the trade was closed. I will post a picture to indicate the exit strategy. I would like to know if these can be implemented into the EAs. The one key to this strategy is I would like the trade closed by one of the two. If 100 pips is met, trade gets closed. If the criteria is met regardless of the status of the trade, the trade gets closed. Which ever one hits first. Thanks to everyone. Please view the picture for the New Exit Strategy. Yellow Lines indicate the exit, for when a trade goes South.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
What indicator? I never posted indicators.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Oops, Sorry, I meant the EA.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
hey mombone.... not sure how the lsar would impact results.... will study on it some, and thanks for the suggestion.... perhaps one of the best filters would be as croesesfx has suggested, the rsi.... trading the lower time frames when daily agrees tends to improve results with the side effect of lowering stress........h

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hey Hayseed, As I posted before still new to this game. Could you post indicators you have on you posted chart? Once again thanks to all for your effort Mombone

--- 帖子 #170 ---

with the 3 additional indicators to this system made +120 just on g/j today will post trades tom, as I go along cheers ps: all trades done manually, without EA

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Sorry, I missed this question. Yes, the 100MA is your main directional MA. If candles are above the 100ma, go Long. If candles are below the MA, go Short.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
These are the two indicators added to help exit a trade when its going south. I made a small change on the colors though. Lime Dark Green Maroon Red OSMA Color OSMA Color 2

HI Jr, Thanks for sharing this simple but very good system and thanks to everyone that has made contributions towards the improvement of the system.

hey mombone , omega and all..... not sure which ea your refering too.... the one in post 56 was the one i ran for several days.... i had 3 very lucky days and pulled it off monday after all trades closed..... i'm writing a new version now which includes functions not yet mentioned but will prove important.... keep in mind the version in post 56 allowed for multiple orders.... those improvements include..... the ability to place buy limit and sell limt orders or not.... the ability to close all orders when total account profit reaches preset level , for use when multiple orders are open.... the ability to close all orders when total account loss reaches a preset level, again for use when multiple orders are open..... a breakeven function..... trailing stop with adjustable start point .... such as 10 pip trailing stop but start only after 100 pips profit..... a user selectable manner to exitlongs and exitshorts in addition to the profitarget..... in other words you might want to exit longs when the daily rsi falls below 50 and i might want to exit longs when the weekly stoch falls below 80, and so on..... a user selectable filter and or filters.... such as you might only want to trade long when the daily macd is above its signal and i might want to trade longs only when the close is above the 10 period dalily sma, and so on..... """ to clarify filters, you would still use the 15, 30, 60 , 240 or other time frame as normal.... using the filters would attempt to keep you going with the trend and take you out when the trend reversed"""""'..... several more improvements, and of course they all would work equally well on any time frame......h

Heyseed, I PM'd you, please check.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Chapter 2 I am calling this Chapter 2 becausae we need to go from here to make sure we are up to date with everything. From here on, if you are new, you might want to read the first post, then jump back to here. The reason I am doing this, is because since I posted the first post, many changes have been added. You might get confused from many of the past post. Or, better yet, if you like, read all of it, but know that this is a new Chapter. Many changes may also be up ahead. In saying that, Here is the latest EA version. Many thanks to Hayseed. I hope to work with him for any improvements up ahead. Once again, as I have said before, feel free to post any suggestions. Lets make this EA one hell of a pip profit maker. I asked Hayseed to make this EA for a 5 minute Chart. If it works with other time frames? I do not know, for I am only using the 5 minute window at this moment. I found it to be very profitable with this time frame. I guess you can try it on other TF in a demo. Anyway, good luck to everyone using this method.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
The option "Time Specific" does what? I set to false.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
hey mombone...... good question...... timespecific is used by the magicnumber generator.... if you attach the ea to one and only one time frame it really does not matter but if you attach it to several time frames on the same pair , it does..... we need a way for the ea to distinguish between the orders..... as example, orders placed on the 30 minute chart from the orders placed on the 60 minute chart...... with 'timespecific' set to true, the magicnumber generator adds the attached charts time frame to the magic number, which makes each time frames magicnumber unique..... otherwise it adds a 0..... it's best left set to true ......h

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hey JR and Hayseed, Maybe late or you may not even be interested. As I have said I'm new so you won't offend. 100 pip target on 5 min charts seems like alot. I used an EA that had option for multiple positions. Each lot position had option for it's own stop and profit. As positions closed stop advanced. The most interesting option was what they called Advanced Stategy. As targets are hit it closes % of position. At target 1 close 30% t2 30% t3 20% t4 20% or whatever adds to 100% . With this you can scalp some early pips and still have part of position run. If interested let me know. Don't have code but will try to answer questions. Once again thanks for all your work Mombone

--- 帖子 #197 ---
No offense taken. But, yes I would agree that the 5min. chart seem too small of a time frame for said number of pips. In saying that, I am posting a picture to show you what happened today. Also, last night in a demo the EA brought me 3 +100 pip moments, and 2 -50 pip moments, for a total of 200 pips. Now, aside from those surging moments, I too, am concerned for those smaller pip moments. If you notice, I have two Indicators OSMA Color, and OSMA Color 2. Notice that when the darker colors change simultaneously, it’s a signal too get out of the trade, and the same holds true for the short orders, with the lighter colors. If there is a way to implement these into the EA,…..well, its still too soon to tell. I just started using the EA yesterday. Note: the Blue Line denotes the Entry point, the Green line denotes the Exit point. And again note the Bottom Indicators. By the way, that trade was 250+ pips today. Do not get confused with the pips in the first paragraph. these are more pips a couple of hours ago. I cashed in today. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201141847

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hey JR Still only using GJ. Notice on Hayseeds posts he is using EU. Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #199 ---
yeah, I know. He is using multiple pairs. I'm sticking to 1 pair for now. But FYI, I demo'd 5 different pairs on one acct. and there was diffinately profit. Hayseed knows his stuff. He is ahead of the game with this. I'm just glad I got him on this thread helping. Oh, and yeah I'm using (only) GYPJPY.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hayseed, post #165

--- 帖子 #201 ---
hey jr.... yep, we can code that..... those indicators are just 2 versions of the macd.... we could use them but it we far more accurate to include the proper code in the ea with inputs so you can adjust the ma's in it..... 50, 100 and such..... will work on it tommorrow......h

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #203 ---

Hayseed, about these indicators. I have been adjusting the settings on OSMA color 2. I am still testing it. If I understood you right, you might be able to include the 2 indicators with the ability to adjust the settings. If so, that would be great. The 2 indicators working together got me out of trades today with profit. Anyway, hope to hear from you soon.

long g/j @ 213.34

stopped out -40

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I notice that on your entrance (the blue line) the candle was not completely clear of the 100ema. The bottom shadow was under it. Do you consider that an acceptable entrance? Is your rule that the candle must close above/below all the MAs or must be completely clear of all the MAs? Also, when in a position, do you close it out when a trade appears in the opposite direction? Thanks

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Ok, the rule is as soon as the opening of the first candle appears. That same candle at the close may even go on and beyond the said lines. As long as its the first opening candle...as soon as it appears. Also, when in a position, do you close it out when a trade appears in the opposite direction? Not sure if this is what you are asking, but if the the 2 indicators at the bottom give me a signal of possible reverse direction, yes, I get out. Sometimes with profit, and sometimes with a small loss.

Hi jr2007 Tks for posting this very simple &amp; chart clean method. I have followed this thread from the beginning, but have not put the method to the test. If I use the 5Min method is there an indicator for that @ this time. Also would the method work on the 15Min time frame in the manual mode as I'm not that keen on ea's. The for your response &amp; I look forwar to giving it a test. AceTrade

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Nothing is set in stone at this moment. I am still demo'ing. But, by all means, use all the time frames you want, and the picture I posted is what I am using for everything related to this thread.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Sorry, but you lost me. The first opening candle of what? What is it the first of? I'm attaching a chart showing what I believe to be trade entrances. Please correct me if I am wrong with any of them. What I was asking in my second question was this: Assume you are in a long position. You have not hit the 100PT or the 100SL. A short entrance appears. Do you close the long and open the short position?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
jr2007 Tks for your reply. Look forward to your results. Just giving the indicator that was posted a quick scan it appears the 15m gives some good trade opportunities on several pairs. When you look back on several pairs &amp; find the 15M, 30M &amp; 1H in harmony it usually produces some nice moves. RSI comes to mind when thinking of a filter. If there is an indicator for this that can be set to use for 15M, 30M &amp; 1H time frames that would be nice. Just a though.

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201280441 Assume you are in a long position. You have not hit the 100PT or the 100SL. A short entrance appears. Do you close the long and open the short position? ---------------------- Sorry, I think I got your question now. When I am in a trade, I only take the longs if the channel is above the 100MA, and the Shorts when the channel is below the 100 MA. Also, I only enter where the next candle (Above/Below) appears beyond all 3 MAs

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Jr, You have used the term "first", "next" and "after" to describe the same candle. I'm having a very difficult time understanding you. Let me try this. Are these true statements? 1. Enter long on the first open above the three moving averages. 2. Enter short on the first open below the three moving averages.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Exactly

--- 帖子 #227 ---
This is how I would interpret it.... Use the 100 MA as the trend, if above, look for longs, and vice versa for shorts. For a LONG: The prior cande closes above the upper MA though part of the body maybe be inside the two MA. If the current candle opens above the two MA, we go long. For a SHORT: The prior cande closes below the lower MA though part of the body maybe be inside the two MA. If the current candle opens below the two MA, we go short.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Here is an idea for a filter. I am posting a picture with numbered arrows that connect to numbered boxes. Please note the color on the OSMA Indicator. I noticed that if I take a Short trade when the OSMA Indicator is Red, the trade is more likely to run its pip course. Also, the same holds true for the Long Trades with the Green color. Now, notice I got out when the Indicator turned Green, it was then that I closed the trade. Although there were many in and outs with many small losses. The Giant Pip Runs made up for that. Again, like I said before, it is just an idea. I need to demo this more. If this pans out, it would be nice to add it to the EA. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201305059

--- 帖子 #230 ---
The problem I see, is that you are entering on the open. You don't know what color the OSAMA bar will be when that bar closes. When you look back on a chart and it seems to work, the OSAMA color you see, wasn't established when you would have entered the trade.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Ok, I did not fully explain, sorry. I am using the OSMA with the last 3 candles majority rule factor for the entry. It is still the first opening candle beyond the MAs. But, actually.....There are times one red, or one green is out, and the next candlestick is the signal, then hey, you get in. Hey, anyone who has been trading for a while knows there is no perfect formula, you work with what you can. Again, this is just brain storming at this moment. Need to demo more.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
hi all just my two cents. Here is a link to a video where Mark explains how to use these channels in trading . he explains it for use in 5 min , but can be modifoed for a trading on a higher timeframe also . Pl check http://www.tradeology.com/lessons/channelintro.html

--- 帖子 #233 ---
hey onlooker..... thanks for the link..... yes that is very similar to what jr is attempting.... to trade a channel of some sort with a tie of some sort to a confirming indicator..... he is using the osma, which is essentialy the macd but with a different appearance.... none the less, it's essentialy the macd.... at the top of the mq4 code in the ea's provided, there are what appears to be excessive number of yet unused bools.... andtruth is, i cut over half of them out..... those bools are meant to be used as comfirmations to keep our trades tuned to the markets direction, as your video suggests..... or at least as in tune as we can get..... again , just as your video suggests.... and yet again, thanks very much for the link.....h

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hey jr.... fixin to send ya the ea with changes.... you can see it takes you out when the color turns against you...... post if it meets your conditions, or holler back if any changes are needed.....h couple points need to be mentioned here..... at first i thought the indicators jr posted in post 209 contained an error.... after inspection what i found was the indicators are using "price weighted" instead of "close".... which of course makes a slight difference, whether or not the difference is + or - , i did not look at..... likely as not in the long run it will make no difference..... and second, i've extended the change in color thru the chart by using the blue bar..... until the bar has completed you will not know its true ending color, so in pratical terms your earliest exit would have to be the following bars open..... and as you can see the trades were closed on that open.......h

--- 帖子 #235 ---
It looks like your EA will initiate a short trade if the OSMA color changes from bright green to dark green. I believe the intent from JR is to only take trades in the direction of the overall color. So, only allow short trades if OSMA is red, and only allow long trades when OSMA is green. The confusion comes from Billbss using a different OSMA indicator in his chart postings. OSMA may be a good filter for this, but we need to use extra caution if we are using different versions of the same indicator. I actually prefere Billbss indicator because it provides more information about a trend weakening. I don't know if that is useful at some point... that is still to be determined. Still, red vs. green was what JR was focused on and that seems to be missed in your EA. I do love EAs. So don't think I'm beating you up. Confusion happens. I very much appreciate your efforts and I'm eager to give it a spin once you get this fixed. I am very surprised to see nobody online besides me, and I am a little concerned that JR has been missing for awhile... JR- are you okay?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Just a note. Have been using last version of EA since late Thursday on EU GU UJ and GJ on 5 min, 15min, 30min with 0.1 lot size and am up over $900. Only thing different is I use 35 pip trailing stop. Looking forward to new EA. Thanks for all your work guys Mombone

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201541481 I pm'd Hayseed over the weekend. I was Brainstorming over the get out method. Boy, did my head explode (sarcasm). Anyway, He sent me an indicator he posted on another thread. Wow, niiiice!!! Guppy Selectable Because I have no problem with the get in method, I would like to use it strictly as the get out method. I know Hayseed can program this, but at this point I feel like I am taking advantage of him. Sorry Hayseed. I will post the Indicator he sent. I will also post a picture of what happened last night. White line indicates a winning trade. Red line indicates a losing trade. Granted, it was only one night of demo'ing, back-test still looks good. Also, I made some changes, "Adjustments". Same 13/13 Channel. No 100ma the get in method is the same, excluding the 100ma. The get out is the Indicator: Guppy Selectable - Red/Blue cross is the out.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Haha.., yeah I'm ok. Thanks for asking.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I'm not sure what you mean. I used the OSMA indicators that JR posted. My chart looks no different than his chart.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Okay, took a quick look at the internals of the "Guppy Selectable" indicator. If you are using the default settings, and taking signals from the red/blue crosses, you are just looking at a 2SMA crossing a 16SMA. I can't check that on a chart from here, but I'm pretty sure I am right. That could allow you to declutter the screen some.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
.....2SMA crossing a 16SMA. Thanks, you were close. I think I got it: 1 SMA Typical Price 16 EMA Weighted Close

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Yikes!! My apologies... I now see what it is. Look, there is a difference, but it isn't significant. Let me explain in case someone else gets confused too. One of the idicators (the one billbss used in his graphic, which is also downloadable in this forum) has 4 color settings. The other OSMA indicator (in the last screen shot char from jr) only has 2 color settings. On the one in JRs previous post with the arrows showing possible trade and non-trade boxes, there are only two colors. If OSMA is increasing the color is bright green, decreasing is bright red. But if you use the 4 color version, increasing OSMAs below 0 are dark red. When they cross 0 they become bright green. When they decrease and are above 0, the color is dark green. When they decrease and cross below zero they become bright red... All of that said, they are giving the same basic reading. So as long as the the 4 color is dark green or bright red, you can place sell orders only. If it goes dark red or bright green you are on buy orders only. Now, this is no doubt selectable in the indicator... but I'm away from my trading system, so I can't verify that. So jr and billbss may actually use the same indicator with different color settings. Clear as mud? If this line is confusing folks you sould probably just ignore my posts on this subject... and I AM sorry.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Okay, again I can't check it on a chart. But in the code it doesn't look like you can select differnt calculation bases (SMA, EMA, etc.) between the MAs. If you change one, it looks like you change them all. The default is going to pass a setting of one (1) for the standard Moving Average indicator. I thought that was the SMA... More important, this indicator doesn't let you set them independent from each other -- I'm pretty sure of that.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Okay, I was able to check some online documentation. The default settings for the Guppy Selectable indicator would give you crosses of the 2 and 16 (I just triple checked this and edited my original post-- should be EMA) of the Closing price. And I double checked the code. There is no way to provide different settings for each line. They all take one setting. However, knowing the basis for those lines gives you the opportunity to tweak the settings for your purposes. Have fun... With you in spirit - Can't trade till after work.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hayseed, Did I see somewhere that you use EA on several different tf? I'm doing that and it worked well for a couple of days but now I have conflicting trades. Buy on 5 min, sell on 15 and 30 min etc. Did I misunderstand or would you just use on 1 tf and if so which one seems to work best for you? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #246 ---
hey qman..... the osma was not used in determining a long or short entry..... it was only used as an exit..... when you were already long and the color changed against you, the ea closed the position..... same for being already short..... rather than using the indicators jr provided, i just used metaquotes standard osma..... otherwise i would have to used the icustom function which brings on potential problems......h

--- 帖子 #247 ---
hey mombone..... yes i used it on 15 , 30 and 60 minute charts at the same time..... many ea's when applied to differing time frames will have trades that appear to going against each other..... so what your seeing is common.... those few days i had the ea running the eurusd and audusd both fell hard so there was never a chance for an opposing trade..... but yes it's possible to have opposing trades on differing time frames and also on the same time frame.... my preference is to trade only with the larger trend..... doing so ' almost' completly rules out opposing/competing trades.... you will be trading one side only, long or short.... almost.... the exception is when there is no trend or at trend changes..... i've always admired those that can trade against the trend..... truth is , i can not.....h

--- 帖子 #248 ---
H, I know this gets confusing because there jr is really doing alot of brainstorming. But, look back at post 229. I thought he indicated there that he was looking to use OSMA as an entry filter. Then later he started tinkering with MA thing for an exit. In those exit discussions his chart no longer shows the OSMA. He also declares he is satisfied with his entry strategy... ... Where that leaves us is a little up in the air. I don't know if he's backed off the OSMA entry filter idea or not. The MA cross exit trigger has some merit... even on higher time frames, but I think that will likely evolve too as it is a problem in some situations. We both know there is no perfection, but hopefully evolutions are allowing us to advance.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hey Qman. Yes, I am backing off of the OSMA. Did not like the results in the backtesting. I took a good look at Heyseeds Indicator Guppy Selectable, as I am currently manually backtesting. Using the entry method of the 13-13 Channel without the 100ma, and using the Guppy Selectable as the Exit, is bringing in some really good results. Only one trade open at one time. If the Guppy Selectable can be implemented into the EA, it would possibly complete this system. The exit is when the new candle opens after the candles close at the cross of the Red and Blue MAs. There were many, many small to medium losses, with huge gains that just blow away the losses. Granted, I still need to backtest some more. So far, I like what I see.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Here is a Close of a trade. The Red and blue cross, the the next candle opens with the red and blue still crossed. I know that there were many pips left on the table. If you can have an automated system that regardless of the number of pips you leave on the table, the system still brings in a significant number of pips, well hey, thats sounds good to me. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201562014

--- 帖子 #251 ---
hey qman.... ah yes, now i see.... jr had pm'd me about including the osma as an exit only, that ea has not been posted.... rather than confuse things and clutter the thread, we were bouncing pm messages and the ea's between us until the ea met his approval..... that was my idea, guess it confused things anyway..... not sure of his plans for using the osma as an entry, he has not spoke to me of it..... jr's post 1 image is very similar to channel trading, which is sworn to by many full time traders..... his orignal rules could be spiced up abit or some evolutions as you mentioned.....h

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Thanks Hayseed for clearing things up.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
jr, thanks for clearing that up. I am eager to play with your system too. I'll have to wait a few hours though. It looks like you are refocused to the 5M timeframe. Are you testing anything longer term than that?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Not at the moment, only the 5 minute chart. I just hope Hayseed is not upset. He put some hard work into an EA, that gave very bad results. I put in a request to see if he is willing to go at it one more time. (Crossing fingers)

--- 帖子 #255 ---
.... one more time ....... ...... hey jr.... now thats a good one..... very few ideas don't go thru a dozen versions..... your only at version 3.... sometimes the end result is far different than the beginning.... it's as qman said, evolution..... and don't get discouraged if your brainstorming doesn't work as planned..... at least your trying.... it only takes me a minute to make changes , so my time spent is extremely small.... ...... one more time ...... .....h

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Just gonna put my 2 cents worth in, as I'm seeing a lot of you leaning towards trading the G/J. Because of high brokerage fees on this pair (carry-over trading available on it) I stopped trading it over a year ago. Instead I switched to the E/J and it has been much more profitable for me. The E/J moves about 30% less than the G/J (these two pairs almost always move in tandem) BUT the brokerage fees are more than 50% less on the E/J than the G/J! My broker charges 7 pips for the G/J and only 3 pips for the E/J. To make up for the difference in the pip volatility I just pop my trades for 2 lots on the E/J instead of trading 1 lot on the G/J. More money in the pocket - and that's what it's all about! And great little system Jr. you have here. Nice to see all the cooperation and assistance you're getting!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Flamenco143, Thanks for you post and advice. I personally tend to try to work out new systems so they fit with GBPJPY first. I find if I can make it survive that I can easily adapt it for EJ. If I just can't get it to work for GJ... I mean it is close but not quite turning profit often enough, I might still try to tweak it for EJ. Not that I have a ton of experience with this, but I'm just giving my logic. Your point is very well taken though. For others who are new, there is no doubt that EJ is a better overall deal because of the lower overhead. Now, to be clear, some people might think that you are suggesting they open 2 trades on EJ for every 1 they would place on GJ. That is still a savings, in my case of at least 1 pip (hey a pip is a pip!). But it would obviously be a much greater savings to open a position twice the size instead, thereby suffering only one spread cost -- and in my case, saving 5 pips per trade. I hope newbys here take the point. But do understand that developing a system on GJ, making it successful, and then transfering it to EJ will tend to give you a cushion of confidence in the long run.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hey guys, I wasn't in on any LIVE trades last week during that Financial big moment. But, had I been, I surely would have lost some dough. In saying that, I ran a test with the EA posted on this thread jr2007_ea_5_minute for the month of January 2008. I adjusted the settings to a 10TP/500SL. Now, I know this maybe considered by many as "financial suicide". Now for those of you who know how to run the Strategy Tester on the Metatrader4, please run this test, with these adjustments. I just want to know if I did it right. I just about doubled the acct. on the strategy tester. Until that debacle last week of course. The Acct. still survived with the original balance+. These are the adjustments on the EA: $5000.00 Balance GPBUSD - SHORT ONLY 5min. Mini-LOTS: .90 STOP LOSS: 500 TAKE PROFIT: 10

--- 帖子 #262 ---
If I may clarify the terms. The term lots is used to describe the size of a trade, not the number of positions open. A trade can consist of anywhere from one lot to as may as your broker will allow. So when Flamenco143 states he trades two lots instead of one, he is referring to the size of his trade and not the number of positions he has open. My congratulations, it looks like we may be witnessing the birth of a great little system.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
My apologies, I meant mini-lots.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Clansman, it was clear to me, and you put it better than I did. But I've been new to things in the past, and I saw the potential for confusion, so I tried to clear it. Again, you did so much better than I. Thanks.

JR, What's happening with new ea? Looking forward to trying it. Mombone

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Your Welcome. I understand. I remember when I didn't know the difference between a pip and a bid. Some great (and patient) traders helped me to crawl, then walk in this business. It is always good to see people who are willing to share and help others. Good luck to all of you working to develop this system.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thanx Clansman for clarifying that. You are right!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Ok, here is the new EA. Lets give it a go, and try to make it work for all of us. Its made so the MAs can be adjusted. Thanks Hayseed.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
jr, I've just attached it to a 5M GJ chart. I'm not sure of the meaning and proper settings for all the options. So, I'm a bit blind here. Can you or Hayseed provide some input on all those settings, or at least their meaning, for the EA? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Well, here's a first note. Price action is such that we would already be in a position when I started the EA. For whatever reason I thought it would wait for a new signal... well, it did, but not like I was thinking. It evaluated the close of the last candle and the open of the new one and jumped right in... in the middle of the existing move. Now, I'm a bit nerveous because Stochastic is showing a cross against me. Normally I would have waited for the price to return to the channel before I took a new signal. Now that I understand this it is not a problem. But good to know before you jump in. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Ok, here is how I understand it. The entry is still the same 13/13. The exit is either the SL, or the Guppy Selectable....which can be adjusted at the FastMA 10, and the SlowMA 80. I had some success, adjusting the MAs, but its a work in progress. I've been adjusting different parameters for different pairs. Whats cool is just that. We can make adjustments.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hey, NERVOUS!!! You are demo'ing right?

Hi jr 2007. I found this thread looking through FF, and have a few questions if you don't mind. What I've seen so far looks really good. I don't quite understand the "no channel required to cross" statement. I wondered if you could explain what you meant by that. Also, if you're trading on the 5-minute screen, are you still using 100-pip TP, and 100-pip SL, or are you shooting for smaller amounts? Thanks for any info you can share, and thanks for the work you put into this method! **************************************************** jr2007 wrote: I am editing the Original Post to make room for the Improved Version of this system. I was having issues with the 1 hr method because......although it can be profitable, it can also be risky. Like everything else in life, we all want the best. To get the best, we must try to improve whatever it is we are striving for. In saying that, I stayed up til the wee hours of the morning, and figured out that it may be better to use a 5 minute chart with this method, along with a "No Channel Required to cross", just as long as the new candle is beyond the 3MAs. I hope I do not upset anyone who has put in alot of work with the EAs. Thank you for your hard work.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Not a great time for the system so far. It has been running for about 10 hours. 4 Losses = -236 pips (on my 2 Cent trades this has equaled -$4.41).... That is 50 + spread for each (those were 3 sells and 1 buy) 1 Win = +100 pips (2 Cent trade = +$1.86) (1 buy) Net -100 pips (2 Cent trades = -$2.55) There is 1 open Buy which is around -25 pips now. It is interesting how as soon as the winning position closed a new position was opened in the same direction. I expected this because I understand how this is programmed, but others might not anticipate that so I mention it here. So far, not overly impressive, but to be honest it has been a very rough day for my primary system as well. This is the USD Fed Statement day, so I have to decide if I want to let this run through that. I'm sure that was part of the problem with the trades so far today. Seems the market is expecting a 2 basis point cut. It will be a wild day for sure if they cut by less than the expectation. Probably a wild day if they cut by more. If they do what is expected it will probably be a wild hour or two, and we'll then end up where we started... But I'm not much of a fundamentalist -- so don't listen to me.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I'll answer since jr isn't in the room right now. The channel is the two 13 SMAs (one based on the high, the other on the low). In the original method, the channel had to fully cross the 100EMA to enable a valid signal. That is no longer the case. We are supposed to take the trades anytime the price crosses both the 13s and the 100. As for SL, the setting that comes preprogrammed in the EA is 50, so I presume we have moved on to that, combined with a TP of 100. Hope that clears it up for you.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hey Jr....r u still refining this method(13 low 13 high chart system?)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Lokin4pips, I assure you this sysem is still developing. Jr isn't here right now, but I know he is still tweaking this puppy. If you have suggestions, I'm sure he'd like to hear them. The EA has lots of flexibility, so you should be able to play with different parameters in the strategy tester if you know how and have good data for backtesting. I generally have a low opinion of backtesting unless you can get the data reliability up to 90%, which isn't easy. Anyway, we'd love to hear your thoughts.

Hey QMAN What TF are you running on? I started on 5 min and I keep getting buys and sells open at same time. Are you experencing the same? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Qman unlucky with those trades today since I cannot open the ea I`m still trading manually anyway have had 2 wins @ + 50 pips each and 1 loss @ 50pips

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Well, I just suffered another loss on the EA, but it has opened a new short (sell) position and that is up, at least for the moment. Another thing is to not forget about my initial entry, which ended up being a loser. That was not a good time or place to be turning the EA on. Mombone -- I'm on the 5M chart too. There is a setting in the EA that allows the total number of open positions. If you set that to 1 then I think it will pick a side of the market and stick to it. If it is anything else, and you keep the MAs at their default settings, it will always eventually open divergent positions. Those MAs (fast and slow) are controlling when the trade gets cut off -- together with the SL and TP. The slow MA comes set at 80 which is nearly 7 hours of average pricing. That tends to keep it pretty far from the current price at times. In a ranging market like we've been seeing that tends to work against you. But when it starts trending we'll make a bundle. CrossesFX -- yep, bad luck. If I had started an hour earlier I'd have one less loss and one more win. -- Since you only took 2 trades, are you filtering your entries in some way? Are you only opening one position at a time?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Qman Only setting I see is maxlong and maxshort which each one is set to 1. Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Qman no filtering same technique as laid out by jr and yes only 1 trade at a time what I tend to do is wait for the market to clear all 3 MA`s and then wait for the next bar to open and close this must`nt touch any of the MA`s then I pull the trigger as long as the AC and AO are the same colour aswell

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Well I'm not 100% certain about it, but above those is MaxLots. It comes set defaulted to 1, I think. My thought was that that would govern the total number of positions open -- maybe not. So, if you have a long position open, and you get a short signal, and MaxLots was set to 1, I thought it wouldn't open the new position since it already had an open Long. It isn't documented yet so I'm not sure if I got it right. Check your setting. If you have it at 1 and it is still opening opposing positions my assumptions would be wrong and we'll have to wait for Hayseed to clarify.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
right now on gbp/jpy 18:00 bar if this doesnt touch the 13 MA then I would be long at the end of this bar

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Funny, it is pretty hard to keep up with JR. The latest rendition is that price must close outside the channel. I don't think the 100 MA is part of the process anymore. So, when you say you must clear all 3 MAs I think that puts you on with some older rules. ... I like you other filters though. We'll see how they pan out. They could be good additions. I'll leave that to Jr to work through. I have to start getting ready for work... So I may be less responsive for awhile.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I see that now. Mine came set at 5. Will change to 1 and see what happens. Of course if it goes other way am I now on wrong side of trade. Maybe if it could be set to close open trade when opposite trade appears? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #294 ---
long 213.41

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Mombone - The MAs are intended to keep you from being whipsawed. I think if you could set this up as a Stop and Reverse (SAR) like you are suggesting you would possible have whipsaw problems too. The bottom line is this is a trend catching system. If there is no trend in the timefram you are in then you will be whipsawed. That is where we are right now. Not the best time to be using this system... but you can't easily know in advance when market conditions will change. So the EA programming tries to find parameters that allow you to survive the less optimal times so you can make up for it when you market and timeframe DO start to trend. CrossesFX - The EA entered me long at 213.41 as well... Sadly, it also has me short at 213.17. (Since I'm allowing me to enter up to 2 trades at a time).

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hey guys, Why not just adjust this setting.... http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201709709

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Jr, while that is an option, it defeats most of my purposes for running an EA. I would have to monitor the market for trend reversals and restart the EA each time I saw that. In the current GJ environment it probably won't make a difference anyway because we are consolidating here. Today is probably a porr day to trade until after the Fed announcement anyway... and maybe for a couple of hours after that even. At this point I don't think we'll move more than +/- 100 pips until after the announcement. All positions are likely to just languish here for awhile. With a 50 pip SL and a 100 pip ranging market, that means there could be considerable "pain" in here. My current Long is down 22, and my current Short is down 10. Channel and longer term MAs have a slight upward bias. For what it is worth, I see on a 4 hour chart where we have crossed and held (for 2 days now) a break of the centerline of a broad channel. Been awhile since it was up here and held this long (price crossed the centerline 4 weeks ago and hasn't crossed back for more than 4 hours since). If we break above 214 I think we'll see 216+ (top of the channel is sitting around 220 right now). I'm seeing biases then to the upside, and I might be tempted to only take long trades... But who knows what the Fed will do, right? Oh, and that channel.... definitely downward sloping. Anyway, the point of working on a 5 minute chart is to not be thinking of such large timeframe trends. The key is, is the market trending in the timeframe you are trading. For us on a 5M chart right now... not enough to make money. We are ranging. We'd make money if we were taking opposite positions... expecting every breakout to be false. But the EA is intended to codify an approach. I do think this system will make lots of money once the market decides where it wants to go. I think I should just set up to only have one position open at a time though, for now. Jr, how are you set up?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
hey qman..... It is interesting how as soon as the winning position closed a new position was opened in the same direction. I expected this because I understand how this is programmed, but others might not anticipate that so I mention it here that is my error, it shouldn't be like that..... all my computers have been tied up running huge backtests for days now and i sent that ea to jr without backtesting it..... otherwise i would have caught the error..... we took out all reference to the 100, when i did that apparently i took out the code responsible for keeping that immeadiate reentry from being possible..... on a larger time frame reentrys are benifical, on small time frames they can be a killer...... might be wise to hold up using the v4 until i correct my error.....h

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I think you are right. I'm shutting it down. I have to go to work now anyway. I'll be checking in throughout the day. Also wondering if you can put some control in so that it won't take a trade when it is initially turned on if the price is already outside the channel. That caused my first loss. I would prefer if it waits to get a close back inside the channel first. Others might disagree, and there could be times you wouldn't want to wait (I guess...), so maybe that could be an external variable option set at startup... Just a thought. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hey Qman, I could not agree with you more. This system, if we can even call it that right now, needs work. One thing I like about the EA, is that the MA parameters can be changed in order to find a better way. I have even gone so far as to change the 13/13 parameters to 600/600, 70/80ma on a 30 minute chart with pretty good results. The problem here is knowing the trend at the moment is key. And as we all know, that trend can turn right when you least expect it. Anyway, I am going to look for a winning formula for past results, and I will have to go from there. Hey, if someone out there has an idea for a filter, where only the longs will go into trade versas the Shorts, or vise versa, please share. I toyed with the RSI for a little bit. One idea, is put a 50 input line with the 5 period. From there, only the Long trades/Short trades on whatever side of the 50 take. I don't know if something like this is programmable.....but anyway, I will continue to test on. Please, don't anyone get confused. 13/13 is still the settings. Paragraph 1 is just...once again "Brain Storming".

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I was remembering a system from the past. Its in one of these forums which many of you may know called The High and Low 8 Hours – (Nicotinas system). I really liked the system except, like everything in this world nothing is perfect. I still like the system. That being said, I thought about taking a page out of Nicotinas System. If you notice, it is primarily centered around the London session. If the EA is placed on the GBPJPY at the London open and left to make or break the 100tp/50sl. Close everything at the end of the London Session. This system does pretty good. For now, that is how I plan to trade this System. Around the London Session. Here is a Market Hours Indicator. The Green Line is the London Session.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
jr I already trade this Nicotina system but I use a 100 SL on gbp/jpy due to its volatile movements

--- 帖子 #303 ---
long g/j @ 212.22

--- 帖子 #304 ---
stopped out - 50 not having a good week with this

--- 帖子 #305 ---
back in short g/j @ 211.50

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Ok, but I meant using this system at those specific hours.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
jr I have only ever traded the London session from 07:00 - 16:00 as I`m from there it seeems more sensible to trade this time

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Gotcha, thanks Croesesfx.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Using the jr2007_ea_5_minute on a 15min Chart GBPJPY 1st attempt: Short entered at 211.53 for a loss of -50 pips. 2nd attempt: Short entered at 211.54 for a gain of 100 pips -50/100 = 50pips

--- 帖子 #310 ---
was the win helped by the news out at 13:30?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Not sure, but whatever helps.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
suppose it could have gone the other way never traded the news myself also leave 45 mins either side anyways you won thats the main thing

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I agree, thanks

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hey jr. the 10 and 80 r part of the EA and when they cross it should close your position, right or am I mistaken about that?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
My understanding, yes.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
hey all..... ok, after a full day of backtesting and checking for trades that were and should have been and trades that were not but should have been and trades that were but should not have been,,,, here is how it appears to me.... the rules have evolved to the point where they are clearly steping on each other..... a entry can be being called for on the exact same bar as exit....... that's a common thing..... also we have never address the "=" issue, which causes holes in the trades..... my thoughts seem to point for a massive overhaul which would have as a basic premise, 1. jr's channel idea but in a slightly different form, 2. one trade and one trade only at a time, 3. be based on the gbpjpy, ..... seems the favorite here..... 4. an exit that matches the entry, 5. coded to switch between long and short on it's own, 6. useable on 60 and 240 minute timeframe, " perhaps lower" , 7. use a higher time frame for trend verification, 8. ?????..... perhaps call it jr2008....... what yall think......h

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Heyseed, All sounds good. How about also no entry past first signal of new trend. As happened to me and some else if turn ea on it will not enter trade in middle of trend. Price must enter channel or new trend appears before entry. I found that when I started the ea it had quite a few bad trades before it got back on track with first signal of the trend. Hope that all makes sense. Keep up the great work Mombone

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Sounds like the right thing to do. Was having trouble with multiple entries myself. Have not been using the EA. Was waiting for an update to code.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hey, if you think it will work, go for it. While your at it, can you take a look at this? Let me know what you think. Original 3 MAs 13hi/13lo, 100ma Add Bollinger Bands (Band Period 30) Entry remains the same. Exit Criteria: A Candlestick must touch the outer band for the signal of an exit. The exit will actually be the first candlestick opening after crossing both 13MAs. Here are 2 examples: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201833766 http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201833766

--- 帖子 #320 ---
hey jr..... the bollinger bands would probably complicate things further..... and your taking profits so quickly is probably working against you also..... this is off topic but applies to the gbpjpy..... a good while back i wrote a ea called "foolish games"..... see note about the name below ..... the settings for different pairs will be different...... for the gbpjpy, if i remember correctly the profit target had to be something like 700..... yes 700..... the stoploss had to be about 150 and trailing stop was about maybe 200...... those figures were probably higher, can't recall off hand.... settings on any below 100 would not work at all..... at all..... if i remember correctly it only used moving averages in the manner of the picture posted earlier, the "painted rsi and moving channel".... you must milk every wave for as much as you can get and that means high profit target values...... my limited experience has been that small profit target trades on the gbpjpy will get beat to death....... it does help however add small lots to already large winning positions..... now about the name..... it helps me name things in a manner that resembles the ea..... such as, the ea's spiderman, superman and cinderella all match their names perfectly..... foolish games was named for it's 700+ profit target...... seems foolish doesn't it.......h

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Ok, I understand. But, On the profit target, if left to 0, letting the Bollinger Bands method take care of it, aside from the 100, or even 150 SL....well, you never know, it might work..?? Name, Hmm....how bout, BrainStormer

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hayseed, is there anyway to program the EA jr2007_ea_5_minute to be off, until it hits a certain time? Another words, If this EA can arm itself only at a said time, going into the trade either taking the 100TP, or the 50SL. Then turning off after the actions of 100tp, or 50sl of both Long, and short? I quess you were right when you said there are many more versions to come. Anyway, take a look at the Calendar I am posting. With the EA armed at 1 hour after the US Open, these are the results for January. If not, I will just make sure to arm it at the said time. And thats using the original settings. 13/13MAs, 100MA, (jr2007_ea_5_minute) on a 5 minute chart. One trade, and only one trade open at one time. If a Long is open, no Shorts are to open, and vise versa. One trade open until final action has been taken, then second trade opens if, and only if a sl has been hit. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201889251

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Here are the results for December 2007. Will continue to post past results as time permits me, you know work, and all. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1201894552

--- 帖子 #324 ---
hey jr..... yeah it would be a simple matter to limit an ea to a certain times ..... trouble might arise if you shut it down completley if there is an open order..... but sounds like your interested in just not opening any new trades "before" a set hour..... otherwise the ea needs to be active to maintain any open orders..... i'm assuming you'll also need an addtional hour to cease opening new trades..... so open new trades between 9am and 6pm only, or something like that..... correct?....... those hours will need to user selectable, due to different people using different brokers or people wanting to trades different markets.....h

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I do not want to get into specific hours, for I have seen some cofusement in the time in other threads. If, you can put in a timer (sord of speak). People just need to find out the time for 1 hour after the US Market open. Something like a time specific to turn on, and .......hmmm, I know I might be asking for something impossible, but here it goes. Once set number of positive pips is hit, EA Shuts Down Completely, until the next US Market Open (1 Hour after). Also, do not know if you understood this part, but only, and only one trade open at one time. If a long, or Short is open, no other trade is to open. Another trade will open, only if the SL is hit. There I asked. LOL

--- 帖子 #326 ---
hey jr...... ok that wipes the need for the final hour....... by ,,, Once set number of positive pips is hit, EA Shuts Down Completely ...... once the "set number of positive pips" is reached, are all open trades closed at that point, both long and short..... is there a set number for negative pips....... and yep, 1 trade and 1 trade only......h

--- 帖子 #327 ---
....are all open trades closed at that point, both long and short....??????? There should not be more than one trade opened at one time, Whether Short, or Long. Negative pips is still 50pip sl. Another words, ' a page from Nicotina' , We are trying for 100 pips. If one trade goes to SL, the next trade is entered. If that one goes into SL, shut down EA. We will settle for 50pips, if the first trade did not get the 100pips. If both SL, we settle for 100pip loss for that day. 100 pip TP = Shut Down 2 SL = Shut Down Once again only one trade open until a TP/SL is hit. TP is hit, EA shuts down. 1st SL is hit, next trade is entered. 2nd SL is hit, EA is shut down. If the TP is hit......Actually, any TP is hit, the EA is shut down. One more note. Because this is going in at a specific time, If there is a candlestick outside the 13MAchannel, and 100MA at time of EA Arming, Short/Long trade should be triggered, even if its the 1,2,3,4,5....Candlestick, trade should be triggered. Hayseed, I hope I did not put too much on your plate. Thanks

Hayseed, is it possible to put in that timer, along with the EA 100tp/50sl shut down?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi, this system looks interesting, thanks. I read few pages of the thread but got confused with all the modifications. can you just confirm that the below is the system you are trading. long entry: when a candle opens above the 3 ma's, we go long with sl=50 and tp=100. short entry: when candle opens below the 3ma's, we go short with sl=50 and tp=100. if tp or sl not hit and we get another trade opportunity then we ignore it. candle most close inside channel then open outside it for valid signal. In a day if sl is hit then we wait for another opportunity to trade, if sl is hit for the second time we stop for the day. if tp is hit once then we are done for the day. so we can have, 100pip loss, 100pip win, or 50 pip win. am i correct? thanks.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Ok, I was not going to post for now, but the adjustments I have made, seems to be working….”for now”. No telling how it will go from here with this little time. After all the changes, I seem to keep going back to the original settings, then adjusting from there. I needed to find a way to filter out Entrys that pulled back immediately. I may have found it with the 5EMA I added. It is not perfect, but seems to work pretty good. With all the Editing, and Re-Editing, I am sure Hayseed just about had it. Hey Hayseed, thanks for all your help. Your contribution to this thread was huge, and I thank you. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok, I did a few tests with this new format: Channel: 13SMA High/13SMA Low No More: 100MA Added: 5EMA Extra Indicator: MACD Colored – Inputs:5,13,1 (Levels: 0, 15, 30, 45, Positive/Negative) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Entry: The first candle to close with the 5EMA outside the 13hi/13lo Channel. Exit: 100TP/50SL, or the MACD goes past one of its levels, and retraces back to that level, other than 0, Take half of the Lots. Let the rest run until TP triggers, or until MACD retraces back to the 0 level. Time to trade: I originally was favoring 1 time slot. I am now favoring 2 time slots. I do not want to confuse anyone with time zones, I seen this a lot on other threads. I will give my time zone, and you will have to figure it out from there. I live in San Diego, California, USA. - Pacific time: 1st Trade opportunity starts at 10:00pm 2nd Trade opportunity starts at 5:00am Note: Yes, I go with the motions both Trade opportunities. If the 1st trade hits the stop loss, enter another trade. If the TP is hit, or the exit with the MACD presents itself, I am done with that Trade opportunity, I stay on the sidelines until the next Trade opportunity.

hey jr, i'm still here..... just been workin night and day tryin to get another an ea up and runnin ..... havin a tough go with it.... hopefully i'll be done with it in the next 48 hours..... and will be able to refocus on your deal here.....h

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I tweeked some of the numbers on one of the EAs and posted my results. I changed the 13/13 to 21/21, Long only. The TP was changed to 50, with the sl at 0. Now, I know, I know……….NO STOP LOSS!!! Well, If you really look at the system, and run it through the Strategy Tester, you will see that it works pretty good without the stop loss because of the Upswing/ Downswing. That Upswing/ Downswing brings on more trades that are opened and closed, keeping profit in progress. Now, August 2007 was dooms day for a lot of systems, and this one by no means escaped it. Aside from those Extreme Drawdowns, this system seems to work pretty good. And yes, I would agree that using this system with no Stop Loss may be suicide, but, I am sharing this info so as to find a possible answer. There may be a way to tweek this system so it can escape those moments. If anyone has any ideas, please share. Hayseed, take a look see. I used the jr2007_with_Duel_MA. I like how this EA re-enters immediately when the opportunity presents itself. I was only able to trade from May 2007. That’s as far as the Strategy tester goes on my platform. So I tested from May 2007 to August 2007 ( Doomsday). The Test using $10,000.00 (15min. Chart) Once again, here are the settings I changed: Lots = 0.05 13hi/13low = 21hi/21low Long only Take Profit = 50 Stop Loss = 0 Set all Fast and slow to = 0 Maxlong orders = 100 http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1203391450

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I ran another test using the same settings, except for: In this test I used a 30min chart, and I was able to test the entire 2007 to end of Jan 2008. Lots = 0.02 I used both Long and Short Long Maxorders = 50 Short Maxorders = 100 http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1203394518

First off, thanks to Hayseed for this EA Ok, time to post this. I once again went into a brain storm. I am happy to say that I have some very, very good results. Now, granted it was only 2007 I back-tested. I will see about doing some further back-tests. Also, if anyone can do me a favor and retest 2007, I would greatly appreciate it. I’m still somewhat in disbelief. I am posting the EA, and the specific settings I used. Initial deposit = $10,000.00 Total net profit = $122,481.45 Can someone please retest for me. I am at ahhh. Initial Deposit = $10,000.00 Long &amp; Short 30min.

Hi Jr ..having stumbled across your thread while searching for demo accounts I was curious to know if any filters were arrived at. Before being registered for forex demos ,looked at the 13/13 sytem on stocks with EOD data with one filter being RSI 14 OR 21 CROSSING 50..over for long and under for short and MACD 12 26 9 crossing and it looks interesting. If you follow the MACD rules it looks as if they will keep you out of wrong trades to some degree too. (Now have two forex demo accounts and am just finding my way into them) Looked for 39/39 without success but trying again.Cheers
