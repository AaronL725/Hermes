Will make a point to follow this thread, sometimes I forget to visit the site. Yesterday Friday I rode the NFP on 1-min time frame. No time for indicators. Managed a 170 pip profit.

Hello Almo. Happy to see this. Will Follow you on this one.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi friends ,post number one is now updated with the system zip ,please put the indicators at the right place and upload the tpl , the explanation's I will put later , Cheers Al

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Great Work Almo, i am with you. Thanks

--- 帖子 #11 ---
ok lets some explanations on how to trade with this system Rules : 1.i trade mostly the 5min chart 2.i trade only from Europe open till UK close 3.Red news release, I don't trade 30min before and start to trade 15 min after the release even if I have strong signal! 4.i trade only those pairs:EURNZD,EURAUD,GBPJPY,GBPAUD,GBPNZD,GBPCAD 5.i have another system only for GU but its not connected to this thread so I will not go into it 6.RR will be at least 1:1 7.i don't enter trade if I see that price stand on S/R zone even I have signal , I will wait it will break it and close 5min candle above/below it! those are the very basic rules please consider them as well for your own sake! another thing I might say and write here , there is no holly grail system out there I can tell so, those who think or tell you that there is one out there I can tell its scam shit issue please friends don't believe for HG scammer's with my very experience there is no HG only on fairy tells please use also with good MM and don't be greedy cause there is no 100% winners and we need to deal also with looses ! ok this is my rules + my mantra now lets move and see how we usually take trades. Al.

Looks very interesting. Can't wait to get all the details on this system. I see some of the indicators are based on times other than M5 and M15. Patiently waiting for more posts on this system. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Wishing you all the very best with this idea of yours Almo........... Hope you make plenty of pips mate.... I'll be following along from time to time especially considering the high volatility pairs you are trading. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #17 ---
MM is the key

--- 帖子 #18 ---
tks for share your strategy.

who took this lovely 50 pips on GN? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Would still like to see some more "Concrete" rules, i.e. enter at arrow and exit when you get a circle. Then what about when the "X" appears? Still trying to grasp how to trade this good looking system.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
From watching both M5 and M15 charts, it would appear that you only trade the arrow and circles on the M15, and on the M5, you trade the circles and Xs.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
what arrow..,i gave example's please look at them . I trade like I explained at the posts of explanations , I don't have any arrows that I trade with them . I trade when all conditions are met together as I explained .

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hey Almo, i got in on the entry number 2 as i missed entry 1. Entry 3 did not build to break the resistance above it so i did not trade it. Hope its same analysis as yours. Thanks

--- 帖子 #24 ---
GBPCAD [M5] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entered under all levels but perhaps a little early since all lines were not red. But trade went really well for a quick and easy +10 pips to TP (TP set a few pips above MS1 support). Onto the next setups.......... ps. will fine tune the entries for the next trade entries ...... Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Did not mean to offend you. I'm talking about the white arrow that appears. It is also in your examples.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
who took the EURAUD + EURNZD SHORT?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
HI,mate I will wait to GCAD to break the low level+all conditions and then bang down if. lets c. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
forget about the arrows , look at the example's I gave and try to understand the conditions I mentioned .

--- 帖子 #29 ---
well, if I missed an entry and tp already hitted I usually don't enter trade cause its kind risky .

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Yes it was a little eager on my part........... Watching all volatile pairs currently and waiting for conditions to be met.... Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #31 ---
GCAD can be also long if all be met Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #32 ---
if there is any Q about the system I here to help. Cheers Al.

GBPAUD [M5] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Nice quick +30 pips.......... An early entry but good chart structure for a short ........ Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #37 ---
you took it right on time . after that long opportunity arrived ,also on EA, I don't have much time to post much but those that understood how the system work can gained lot of good opportunities Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Each EMA added on historical chart looks very good, the problem is as real account and stress Add the EMA 100 + EMA 40, every confluence gives the signal. I have an interesting system and will add to download for free, but I'm a junior in the forum and I can not post new topics

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi mate, my system don't based only on MVA... you missed some. Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
GA EA short.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Looking good Almo for a few pips but how many pips are you chasing on each pair? Just to the closest S+R level or a little deeper?.............. Masterrmind..........

--- 帖子 #42 ---
On EA i look for S4 cause i carry this trade for awhile and for GA i look at the next 00 ish.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
With these pairs it pays to give them some room to move and develop so good idea on your part. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #44 ---
its about 50 pips each(on EA I took some from the high)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yes I've given it a bit more space to move but 50 is reasonable...... Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #46 ---
yes,basically the potential is way more.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes I'm pushing for about +80 but depends on how they travel and the reactions of price to key levels of S+R in which case I may cut their run short and pull out some profit! Time will tell ........ Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #48 ---
GBPAUD [M5] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Took +44.5 pips just above S1......... Will consider re-entry for another leg down......... Masterrmind............

Closed out GA for another +10 pips. That's it for me today............. Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Almo, Thanks for another great system. I have just been playing around with the alerts. Is there a way to set the 'M30 Wilder's DMI' alert to notify when the level gets above 4 or below -4 as per your rules? If not, are any of the other indicators suitable for alerting to setups? Many thanks Moonie.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thank you almo for this great system. Could anyone please upload only the used indicators and template?

--- 帖子 #61 ---

Very nice mate........... Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #66 ---
GBPCAD [H1 chart] also looks interesting........... Attached Image (click to enlarge) The GBP news is due out soon which might help with some momentum for your trade.... lets see! Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi mate, What's your opinion about GCAD?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I hope it will not take all the pips away,, lol

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Playing the patience game on GCad until after the news release. However, depending on the outcome and PA a really nice trade would be to short the pair down to the weekly pivot around the 2.0200 area, reassess at the pivot and then re-enter under the right conditions. No entry for me at this stage though as the pair sits at a very critical price level... it could go either way so be careful! Note that once price for GCad has hit the 2.0200 level the market has bought aggressively........... Masterrmind............ :nerd:

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks mate I appreciate your input Al.

Hey Almo. I hope you had a good weekend. I was going to start studying your methods and follow this thread but I'm unable to use the template file you you posted on page 1. Would you be able to give me some support as to why I'm seeing what I'm seeing on my charts. I have all the indicators in my mt4 indi folder.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
But you violated most of rules here. Did you not?

well done mate , 5min strategy very good scores on the forward testing , I also do some forward testing for my new min 1 system but really i don't see any interesting about my thread sadly its going to be a dead thread and its kind shame anyway GL Al.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thanks Almo but any thread really needs a captain to steer the ship otherwise it will eventually run into the reef... so to speak. I'm certainly not a trader who likes so many indicators on a chart to be honest with you but your templates bring winners and that's what counts in the end........ profit. Hopefully the participation rate picks up in which case I'd keep posting away from time to time but if not then there's not much you can do about it. Just keep making profit I guess. All the best mate, Masterrmind............

Hi Almo, Don´t give up on your thread, just looking at the downloads shows there are a lot off people interested in what you are achieving with your system. Lurkers out there join in when you can. Winning pips to us all!!

Hi Guys, Kindly tell me something about this system: 1. On average, how many trades do you take every week using this system? 2.Of all these trades taken per week, on average, what percentage of the trades are wins? ie is it 50% or 60% or 90% wins 3.Can one use a risk reward ration of 1:2 or better on this system? Im looking forward to your responses..

Hi mate,if you grab about 50 pips each trade on min 1 I think its ok to pay those 5to 8 pips spread cause they give good volatility that's the reason I trade them Cheers Al.

Great! I am seeing the entries but where did you exit? The SSBO draws its own arrows (which I changed to white on my charts) so that's a bit confusing.

Hi Almo, First, thanks for the trading methods you have posted. Second, I cannot figure out how to remove that corallish box with all the different stats and figures on the left side of the chart, and keep the breakout boxes intact on the chart (one of the charts you posted had exactly that look that I want) Thank you.

Hi Almo, Did you go short on EA close to 1.52300 level? If so it means you waited for the break of the box and max DD so far would have been only about 15 pips approx and your trade is about +30 pips up. Nice work mate..... Masterrmind............

GBPJPY [M1; ALMO] Conditions met for a long........... However, price is very close and also under MR1........ An entry could be made though since SL would be just below the DO however such a trade may need to absorb additional DD...... I will wait patiently for a better entry perhaps once price breaks clearly out above resistance level. Masterrmind...........

tell the truth I missed this signal..it was valid but now its to far from the entry so I will leave it I will look for continue the short on GN GA and EA I just will wait for all condition to be met and also the levels to break Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
GN also met conditions for a short @ 2.21936 Almo about start of day +1 hour but I did not trade it! Price bounced up off S1 so I'm keeping a close eye on the PA before I decide to trade that pair. On GJ my chart did not satisfy conditions but its possible it did on your chart since the price is very very close but MS1 support just under your short entry so I think better to wait for price to break out below that level and then short it down but many roads to profit mate!....hmmm... Masterrmind............. :nerd:

--- 帖子 #173 ---
EN long conditions met............ but close to MR1 so be careful.......... ........ and now also long conditions for GN met............ Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi, iam still learning about this thread strategy. How do you all set TP/SL ? Could u please give explanation with your Trading record picture how to set TP/SL ? Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Read Post #1 and then the thread as it has been outlined............ Basically you wait for a signal but be sure to consider how close price is to S+R levels, pivots, daily open price etc before making an entry. When conditions are met determine your SL by adding about 10 pips to the other side of the box on your chart then total the pip distance from your entry to this SL level. If SL = 40 pips then set your TP = +40 pips........... Make sure to consider S+R zones and it might be a good idea to adjust your SL or TP slightly. Short trade - if SL is below a key resistance level then consider placing it on the far side maybe 5-10 pips above resistance level Long trade - if SL is above a key support level then consider placing it on the far side maybe 5-10 pips below support level Then set TP pips &gt;= SL pips so you enjoy at least a 1:1 ratio once TP is hit. Note: the trader should consider all factors before entering a trade and never trade blindly as it will likely lead to errors........... Good trading, Masterrmind............. :nerd:

Hi Almo First of all, Thanks for your system. I read all the posts but i still have one question: in the 4H system do you use the same pairs of the 5M system? Different pairs? Or we can trade anypair?

Hi everyone, Was taking a look at the M1 system and it seems like the arrows come in way after the many candles have closed. Isnt this a problem with anyone since the arrow comes in lower after the candles have gone up for a buy??? thanks.

Hello traders, at first i have to say that i'm really impressed of this strategy. At the moment i'm trading the 1min system. I took my first trade on EUR/NZD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think it was a valid entry, all rules have been met. And yeah i got some pips out of it ;-) but i some questions. Here is what i did: After i entered the trade i set my S/L 10 pips above the "box" (you guys mean the big blue boxes, right ?). So as i set the S/L 40pips away from my entry point i have to set TP at least 40pips below my entry price. But in this TP range is a MS1-level. And here i have the question: How do you know that price is not going to respect this level and starts a retracement up to my S/L ? So in my logic i would set the TP near the MS1 and take these 20 pips. But what happens with my S/L ? In this case the S/L have to be maximum 20 pips above price ... So i have to adjust the S/L to my TP ? Not the other way around ? Hope you can understand what i mean Nice work, guys ! Keep it up ! Messi

EURNZD [M1; Almo] +42 pips.......... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Masterrmind..........

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Yes the blue breakout boxes..... Sounds like you are doing the right type of thinking so no problem there! Personally, I like to give these volatile pairs quite a bit of breathing space and you can read that as meaning generous (larger) SL placements otherwise you might find that your trades get stopped out only to see price smash through your original TP. If you decide on a shallower TP then tighten up your stop a bit but best practice in trading these pairs is to make sure you maintain a positive reward to risk ratio meaning TP &gt;= SL but after some experience you will know when the chart presents a situation where a much tighter SL can be applied. The trader makes the decision in the end and I'm sure you'll make the right decision. Almo has outlined what he does at the start of the thread but some situations are simply outside the box so to speak so no harm asking. ps. sometimes I start out with a wide stop and then as the trade progresses I'll tighten it up or close out the trade altogether if I think its headed against me. Good trading, Masterrmind...........

Sorry I get it was lookiing at the wrong pair lol

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi Josh11, Areas of S+R and pivots etc are treated the same as giveway signs to me its as if the market takes a short rest and either continues on (UP or down as the case may be). Of course price doesn't always hesitate (slow down) at these levels and sometimes as in real life a car will keep accelerating straight through a giveway sign as if nothing was in their way. Fortunately, price tends to slow down quite often at these levels and this is when the market might be giving out hints as to its intended direction. An earlier entry is perhaps ok provided you are anticipating a smaller (much) TP. The big deal here and this is important ..... don't trade blind..always make sure that the trade makes sense and that the probability is on your side because an entry should never be made simply based on a few triggers being met. Check the levels, watch for areas of consolidation and stack those positive factors on your side... you'll win more trades that way! Good trading, Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Thank you very much mate

Dear all, can anyone please help a newbie ? I realise the SSBO dynamic breakout box indicator does not refresh itself, after leaving the charts on for hours, the indicator does not draw new boxes and update itself anymore, only upon re-applying the indicator onto the charts again then I can see the new breakout boxes. How to make the SSBO indicator to auto- refresh by itself? There's something wrong. My chart (almo 1 min template) becomes like this after leaving MT4 running for few hours.

EN 1m +43 pips

The only thing I can see that could be a warning in regards to my 52 pip loss, was there wasn't really any breakout box untill like over 100pips higher! So now I will wait for price to consolidate and then push down

--- 帖子 #230 ---
That's the way I see it too. No need to jump in too early. Using the S+R and pivots also helps but sometimes I wait for the trigger, then I wait for a small pullback against the intended direction and then nail the entry say in the case of a short just under a key resistance level that price has respected. This also tends to avoid some unnecessary DD and might give you an indication that perhaps it is best not to enter that trade after all! Masterrmind........... :nerd:

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Sounds like a very good idea and also gives us a smaller SL

Hi Josh11, London Open is always great in terms of developing a driving momentum for price. However, I look for opportunities in the Tokyo Session too and sometimes later in the London/NY sessions. I prefer to make entries based on triggers, chart structure (S+R, pivots etc etc), pullbacks and of course keeping in tune with the sentiment of the market. You won't ever find me trading blindly such that if this trigger turns red I sell and if it turns green I'll buy.... no way!!! I trade with as much probability on my side as possible! ps. I also ensure that SL's are placed at reasonable levels for each and every trade! Masterrmind............ :nerd:

--- 帖子 #237 ---
EA looks like a good opportunity to short?? Several other pairs (EN, maybe GN, possibly GCad if it breaks below 2.05500 + others) also have been and are shaping up for great trades! Masterrmind......... :nerd:

Since I am new to this system my answere could be wrong, but there si nothing wrong with your entry. It looks like it meets all the entry requirements. The losing trades are part of any trading system thats it And if you look the previous signal was nice winner K.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thanks K. Another thing I've noticed was the MR1 support just above at 82.742. Should have waited for price to close above that.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Yes pullbacks against your favored direction are always an issue with the volatile pairs. What I try to do is simply observe price, that is to say, I delay the entry as much as possible (unless the chart structure looks highly favorble to enter straight away) and watch what PA (price action) is attempting to tell me. To be fair I do apply a few other trading techniques such as PA, Fib ratios, ABCD patterns etc but mostly I observe what price is doing and then if I'm not convinced that the entry is great then I'll wait...and wait and wait until I believe the entry is better. This might be as simple as waiting for the next hour or so to see if price pushes up to test the next higher resistance level in the case of shorting a pair or the next lower support level if longing a pair. This process of waiting for a better entry will avoid many bad trades (apply it and you will see) but depending on where your stop is placed you won't ever be able to avoid all losers but by applying good MM and risk:reward ratio you'll easily survive the losing trades. Good trading, Masterrmind.......... :nerd:

hello there. Well..i see this thread is kind of "gone with the wind".. anyway remember the 1k I started at 20 in December ,---its turn to 16k! my one min strategy with considering sup/res zones ) check it out Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I hope some of u make some money with it. now I work on some great 15/30 min strategy with great concept behind it- the concept of range and breaking levels with momentum tell the truth that I don't c any comments here in my thread and its sucks cause this system I think worth some comments/feedback's according the sum of people's that downloaded it so I really don't know if its worth the bothering to publish my idea's/my new system anyway.. Cheers Al.

As you know mate I love this system and would trade it if I had the screen time for the 1m tf... Really excited to here you are looking to make 15/30m TF system as that's the Tf I trade You result are incredible mate keep up the great work

Hey Almo, I guess the thread needs its captain otherwise there is no-one to steer it away from the dangerous reef and sooner or later disaster or in this case low contribution to your thread! Nice results and I agree that by carefully watching PA and taking notice of S+R levels they are certainly achievable! That's what I've found anyway. Take care and may your great results continue.

whats up mate today during the evening about 12 hrs from now or so I will start to publish my new system (15min system(we can use it also 30min)) hope will bring some new wind to my thread Cheers Al.

Hi Am confused you say forget about it when a person ask about your fun tading and now you have used it to turn 1k to 16 k witch is awsome, but now you working on a new system ??? WHY ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #263 ---
It could be because not everybody has time to watch 1m chart possibly, 30m to 1hr much better IMO.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I know that the 1 min system works perfectly if you combine it with simple PA and S/R it just nice. It would be lovely to have something also on higher tf and as Alamo describet the new one will be on highr tf so seting myself ready to try the new one out also K.

Awesome results Almo! Will be great to see the 15/30 strategy.

New to thread, just seen it last night and read from post 1 to last one. First it was very foggy but after downloading and studying a bit the charts with the tpl, it started to make some sense. Gbp/cad entry @mr1 with sl above 1st red box and tp @fpv2. Was that a correct entry and exit ? Would appreciate if people who use this method post some charts when taking a trade or even after and illustrate in screenshot where tp/sl. Did i do wrong by entering at MR (major resistance?) As soon as i seen 7 on rsihisto i entered and followed the rules as i understood. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks Almo. I have been eagerly waiting....

--- 帖子 #304 ---
ok , this system I use only with 15min chart tf, we can use it with two different ways, I will start with number one option, also I must say this system not for lazy traders..,we must look left for s/r zones and we have 3 indicators on the main chart that can help us with that in this system I look for breaking points with the trend! my sl will be the last swing h/l for the day and the tp will be usually like that: first tp at the first s/r zone I close 75% from my trade and the left 25% I will close at the second/third s/r zone and when I do that I also move my 25% left trade sl to the be point!(we need to trade like pro's) ok,so now after we understood the tp/sl strategy we will see now on chart the first option on how to trade this system this is from last Friday EA long Attached Image (click to enlarge) GJ SHORT Attached Image (click to enlarge) ok,this is how we can use it as first option the next post I will explain how we can use it in another option Cheers

--- 帖子 #305 ---
the second use with this system is like that: 1.we draw 2 lines - 1 line at the high from 10pm till 9:30am UK time and another line as the low price for those given hours 2.we wait to see if price break and close above/below for those lines (for long price must cross and close above and vice verse for short) we use also the macd and the dmi to c the trend if its negative and its broke the lower = we go short and vice verse for long Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3.tp/sl will be the same as the number one option that I explained at post 304 ALWAYS LOOK LEFT TO DETERMINE S/R and hard break points!! Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks for the fix...What about the right upper corner TP points...They were good in my opinion to determine the exit faster..Maybe I can enable it from the indi myself?

Just 1 example of the trades made today using the M1 strategy but heavily based on the current uncertainty of the driving fundamentals. EURAUD [M1; Almo] Cool +150 pips with only about 7 pips DD on this pair! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Big gap down in the morning so I waited for the market to 'stabalize' and a pullback up closer to the pivot, then on bearish intent to the downside I entered with a TP = 150 pips just shy of MS3 on the monthly support! Just imagine the pips to be had on the GBP/XXX pairs and certainly no need to post all these charts! What a day! I only hope that other traders were onto these trades too! Masterrmind............

How do i use this latest system? i seem to be confused

--- 帖子 #320 ---
the explanation not clear to me tooespecially the method 1.thanks

--- 帖子 #321 ---
HI all.. i built and tested new system for the 15 min time frame with not much complicates (i figure out that the last 15 min tf strategy traders didn't understood it..) i can tell that i made great profits with my min1 strategy and also the 15 min both strategies, later today i will put here the last edition of my 15 min tf strategy even that i see that this thread is going to die and its shame cause rely i saw and see lot of crap systems and EA's(algo trading) and i do not understand why traders thinking that robots can trade instead of them..rely..robots can figure out levels like S/R zero levels Supplies and demands.. well i do not think that if one is to lazy to trade normally better not to trade at all!, OK so back to our point in about some hours i will put here last version for the 15 min tf , in this way i hope traders will be able do some extra money Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks for your contribution Almo. I really appreciate it. I have tried both 1 min and 15 min of your strategy. I would like to say both are good to make profits, but I just had no idea why there are lots of levels clustered together, what I mean is when you open your position, there are lots of resistances and supports nearby and it confuses my mind whether I should enter, and when I enter, should I take profits or not? Mind to elaborate on this?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Almo, i'm a silent thread lurker xD But thank your for your hard work! Yeah fungfung i experience the same, but i think everyone has their own pro's and con's with a system. Looking forward to your new M15 strat!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hey Almo, thank you for sharing these great strategies ! Especially the 1min strategy is working really fine for me :-) I'm looking forward to your 15min strategy update. Keep it up !

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi friends as I promised , my simple 15 minutes system with no much complicates... as I always say please consider PSR and rejection area's also there is three indicators on the main chart to highlight that for the traders! those lines will keep your money in safe place ! I will explain how to trade and its very simple to use, I must mention that this system is not for brainless traders , one must be very sharp b4 trading in general I suggest to trade first in demo to understand the idea and then with small money as I always do my mantra is to take small money and made from it big money I usually open 1k account and mostly turn it into 10/20k I think this is the real deal I usually trade with 1000 pips extra in my arsenal - meaning If I have 1k acc I trade 1usd =0.1 for one position when I done with the specific position only then I open another position and always /1000 when my acc is turn to 3k I always withdrawal my first investment =1k!,in this case my investment is in my pocket again and after that every each two weeks I withdrawal 50% from my profits and leave 50% to my Capital meaning / lets say I did the next two weeks another 1k after I made the first withdrawal from the 3k so I have now again 3k I leave 500usd to continue the growing of the capital and 500usd to my bank, in this way I also secured my first invest money(1k), start to build up my capital and gain extra money to my pocket ok this was some my point of view about how to take small money with winning strategy and make it nice money with secure and enjoining. now lets look at the system : this system I use with 6 pairs : EA,EN,GA,GCAD,GJ,GN this system potential to gain about 1000 to 2000 net pips a month again I will repeat WE MUST CONSIDER PSR SUP DEM and REJECTED ZONES!!! below two example's(one long and one short) long Attached Image (click to enlarge) short Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) Almo15si.rar 149 KB | 700 downloads if there is any Q, I will help as soon as I be able to do so trade wisely Cheers Al.

Almo, Thanks for the method. Do I get it right that the main trigger for entering a trade is CCI 34 going above/below 100/-100? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi mate you mast consider not only the cci also all the indicators below must be in positive , please check out the GJ trade from last week and the continuation of it today,check out below Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Ok thanks will give it a go

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hey Almo, i had no time to post today, but when i just started my pc i saw my tp was hit Is the entry correct? (i think i was a bar or 2-3 late but it didnt matter at the end i think). When i opened the trade there was a supply/demand area drawnat the place where my tp was hit, but now it is gone, so that is repainting. Does that matter or usually if i had time i would not yet exit the trade here where it was exited, is that correct? The first pic shows how it looked when i opened the trade, second pic shows how it looks now (so my question is if the supply demand areas are drawn differently, when do i need to exit?) Hope it is clear!

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi mate the supp/dem indi still same at my pc..anyway we have 2 more indicators mainly is the PSR lines (ZC indicator ) and in my version i have also the murey math indicator also you can open clean hr1/hr4 chart and mark rejected zones to determine what is the historical price rejection area's i attach GJ chart that show's the supp/dem is ok (one zoom in and one zoom out) hope its help Al.

I am also there ,my tp according the support zc indicatir i aim for s2 first then i will secure my profits and if will break s2 i will go for next one.Cheers.Al.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Way too many indicators used lol... It gets more complicated and more confusing when looking at 10 indicators at the same time plus the most confusing one which appears on 1m trading system also. The support and resistance one. It may be this support but if it is passing it than maybe 2nd support and if it is passing that one could be the untested support and so on. You enter a trade and if it goes wrong than you entered at the wrong support so your mistake for rushing.. if you enter again at 2nd one thinking you are correcting your early reaction from first trade it may not be that support again and it just f**cks your brains leaving you wonder why are you trading this way. Great effort for putting up 4 systems but unnecessary complicated

--- 帖子 #342 ---
​For me, the indicators filter out early entries and assist with where to place TP and trail stops. If you read the entire thread you may find the indicators are there to assist rather than complicate things. The trade below is a case in point. Entry taken at break out box 1.4857 when all other parameters aligned. SL -41 below break out box and green support box engulfing MS1. TP at +41 just below purple resistance box and just below big round number 1.4900. R:R of 1:1 and TP hit.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Chill out mate,looses are part of the game,if you have 100% wining strategy just go 4 it.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Well done mate.Cheers.Al.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It's not about chilling as i'm not angry or nervous or anything.. You posted your trading method and i wrote a feedback on it.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
My friend, if you disparage the freely shared work of those who are more knowledgeable, you run the risk of them no longer sharing. The OP has nothing to gain from sharing his work, other than the satisfaction of helping fellow traders. If we antagonize them, what's to stop them from deciding it just not worth it. He can go on trading and making money without the hassle of dealing with the negativity. Just my two cents worth. Best wishes.... GDayMate

--- 帖子 #347 ---
​Hey Almo, on the original h.p. 5/15 min. system you posted is DMI ranging considered between +1/-1 or +4/-4? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
@Almo2312 Please which one of the resistance you use for BUY trades R1 type or MR1 type? Thanks

--- 帖子 #349 ---
yes mate, usually I will look for breaking those levels as sign for momentum

--- 帖子 #350 ---
which system we talk about 15min or one min? M stand for Middle, I usually combine those levels with other lines I look for historical on the higher tf's but mostly will look to break the R1

--- 帖子 #351 ---
The last 15mins trading system is the best trading system for me. Though I understand all of Almo's system. The 1 min system is cool but I don't have that much screen time. I will post here opportunities of this week I saw. I used some but was away when some happened. For now, I only need to work on the best position to put my take profit. Here is trade number one, in fact I am still in the trade as it showed up late hours of Friday. ​

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I took this

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Another I took.​

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I missed this one. Away from my system then but good take.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
This was how the week started on GJ. Did not take this one though.​

--- 帖子 #356 ---
ok guys that is all I can post. I use the system on other currency pairs with lower spread and it also went fine. will not post those as its not in Almo's pair list. The system is very profitable. Made over 10% profit on my account with good DD. For now I use a TP and ST of 1:1 like the 1min system until I see a better option. I suggest to fully understand it you need to see how Almo thinks by going through his other systems. All he want to do is enter a trade when the trend has started in the direction of the trend. I think I prefer it this way. Thanks Almo for your help, I have followed you from the start of this thread and you have greatly help my profitability in the market. Your systems are so easy to understand and follow and very profitable. I know the thread looks isolated, want you to know that it has really blessed my life. Thanks once more.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
ALmo, thank you for sharing your system here, I like very much the Wilder's DMI Indi .. cheers Mate. In my m15 chart .. whats the M30 Wilder's DMI means .. is that means 30 mins DMI Indi in M15 chart? Will study the rest of the indies now ... Thank's again for sharing.

nice one, Almo my man!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
that was a 5lot shot, I even discovered how to enter at a better entry to make 1:2 risk to reward. Can only be posted with Almo and Mastermind's permission

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I will glad to hear that , share with us . Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Share your findings friend. I still apply on a regular basis a cut down version of Almo's M1 tpl on the volatile pairs ...... and it works a treat! Masterrmind..........

--- 帖子 #365 ---
whats up my friend MM Congrat for your new thread and GL on that Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Cheers Almo and its great to see your threads full of many goodies ........ As you know though I tend to cut out most of the indicators I don't need and use a basic template but I enjoy the M1 tpl of yours my friend.... I'm a strong believer that a trader should adapt and modify a system to make it work for themselves ........... that's what I do! I always welcome discussions on the volatile pairs because if you can trade these successfully on an M1 TF then basically you have the skills to trade any pair or index on any TF. Keep up the great work mate you are doing good here! Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Mastermind, I agree with you that you need make every template suit your person before you can really profit from it. It has to feel like its yours. This might mean adding or removing indicators. The last 15mins trading system is my kind of system and am enjoying it. Just a little tweaking can do the magic. ​

--- 帖子 #368 ---
The trade I entered over thee weekend changed direction and hit my stop loss this is the 3rd trade for this week, if it hit my TP then I am even from last week. Almo please allow my USDCAD example.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Which of Almo's systems are you testing Rajkumar?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Almo 515 high prob system.rar the system which is in page 1 post 1

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Yes. That is my preferred method here as well. It suits my personality best. Enough entries to keep me engaged, but less stressful to manage, as compared to the 1M. Welcome to the thread and best wishes!

--- 帖子 #377 ---
3rd system is very nice to follow.I am trying on it.look how it goes on.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Yes that's right! A trader always has to apply some caution and common market sense including keeping a watch on key news events (so your stop doesn't get knocked out after which price would have smashed through your TP like a freight train .....). Many times if you consider the main factors, watch the PA across the chart and then time the entry by waiting for price to pull up closer to a resistance level or recent price action activity before going short .... these simple techniques can offer your trade lower DD (less pips in the red before they go green). One point to be said about the volatiles is that they can be dangerous but they can also generate an enormous amount of pips! Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #379 ---
GN Setup, lets see how it goes.

i am also in

​Short EN after it broke yLow. TP @ S3. Stopped out for full SL, but grabbed some to the long side on this one and EA.

​Short GJ with tight stop. It already traveled 300 pips today.

Gr8 trades GDMATES. Cheers. Al.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Thanks bro!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
This thread deserve much more attention because here is some best trading technique i ever seen .But thread is quite silent.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Just bagged +64 on GN. Open shorts on GA and EN with stop to b/e. After several weeks trading the original 5/15 system posted by Almo, my experience has been that you must be very selective in only taking the very best entries. If traded properly it will be the best 3-5 days per month where you will make your profit. I have posted mostly winners, making it look easy. But there is more to it than that. Every day is a learning experience. My account is up, but not as much as one may guess. Spread and commission take up quite a bit of the gains. There have been trades taken that could have been avoided. Just one less losing or b/e trade per day can have dramatic results over the course of a month.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I guess some traders like to be lazy.. trading is serious business , therefore one must treat it very caution and yes trading sometimes is very complicate therefor I tried to put best things on my chart and shared it as well , honestly beside several traders that I think they got the concept of my trading style and I think they doing great , I don't see any new traders followers etc etc ..its very weird.. , as I understand it lot of ppl looking for automate systems.. tell the truth in my 8 yrs of experience I didn't saw any robot that know to do the trader job,also I work at small broker co , anyways those that know how to use my systems please share your trades that we all be able to learn together...I still have faith in this thread.. also I made another system that fix for the 15min/hr1/hr4 time frames , still check it and so far looking good, I will publish it if/when I see this thread going too live.., Cheers. Al.

Hey Almo, I'm also onto GA but prefer price to head up closer to the S1 level (red circle/ellipse on chart) and then short it down to MS4 (about 200 pips) Attached Image (click to enlarge) If price doesn't pullback up into my preferred shorting zone then I'll look to enter a little lower down ..... Once I'm in the trade I'll post SL and TP (but SL will initially be above the pivot and then tightened as the trade progresses and TP at MS4 but modified if and as required including taking profit earlier than that level .... following the PA). Note: the thick pink horizontal line 1.8483 ish is where Almo plans to look at entering the GA pair on a break lower...... Masterrmind........

GA Another ideal place to short is if price stalls and then shows bearish intent just under MS1 (1.85890 ish) level which is also in confluence with recent highs.

Moved the pending Sell Stop up higher. Now short GA with the stop well above the pivot and TP over 200 pips to the south. Only 1 entry NOT 2! PA in action meaning any sign of bullish intent and the trade might be short lived...... Masterrmind...........

Hello, Almo. I wondered if you might have any of the templates or indicators in a form other than .rar. I have Mt4 and I need .ex4 type. Thank you

--- 帖子 #418 ---
u can open it in any WinRAR or WinZip software , just Google it . Cheers. Al.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hello Almo, I think you got a good system, but many people are not here because your indies are in the .rar files. People do not like buying stuff....., also the free version or .rar crashes some people's computers because of viruses. Nothing is free...., you pay for it one way or the other. Thanks and Good luck

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi mate,i see that above than 3 k ppl are downloaded my systems also me myself use the rar/zip software..

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Way to go Mastermind! FYI - GN has 5 of 6 indicators pointing up on 15min system. Could roll to all 6 soon. EN would be the next one to roll over to a buy.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
whats up mate,be aware on GN its very ranging and less vol and in this vol pair its kind weird BTW! also the below indis tell u that its ranging Cheers. Al.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Is a lot of things Free, You have Open Source Software, that is free, and u can use it to unzip/unrar zipped achive files. Try form this site... http://www.7-zip.org/ Best of luck Take care

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks Almo. Always appreciate your feedback.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Sometimes you need big b**ls to trade these volatiles. This usually means starting with fairly wide stops for example at least 30 pips up to 100 pips. This is because even if you get the direction right if the stop is not big enough you may get (you probably will) stopped out of an otherwise great trade! I also consider the general strength of a currency (base versus counter) by considering the fundamentals (ie what the news is generally saying about the pair .... I look for hints and then I try to make sense of the information from a technical perspective on the charts. You see when you trade these volatile pairs you need to have as much probability of winning the trade as possible to have any chance of success. I agree with Almo regarding the GN pair it is quite rangy and this may not be suitable for trading at the moment however once it moves away from a rangy type behavior then it can be traded. Personally, I do not trade EN or GN very often at all mainly because I find plenty of other opportunities in EA, GA, GJ, etc pairs. Masterrmind..............

almo does any of the last 15min strategy indicators repaint? seems it repaint few bars backwards thanks

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I see the support and resistance repaint but that is to be expected, based on the most up to date price action.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Almo, I must tell you I think your work is superb and thanks very much for sharing. I have successfully applied your 15m template to 1m DAX and FTSE. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
something that I work on it as another option for the 15min time frame so far looking good must tell that its based on NRP indicators as my all systems, so far I rock the market mostly with my 5 min system , this is how my second option looks like. shame that this thread is dead , I know that the 5min and the one min strategy are the best , honestly I didn't saw any free shareware systems that even close to those two results .. anyways take a look at my new another option 15min tf sys and no its non repaint(all my system are NRP) , stop the BS talk..

Hi Almo, Your systems are top notch in identifying directional bias. I think the low level of participation may be due to the thread not addressing other needs of the typical forum reader. They may not admit it publicly, but I believe the greatest need for many FF readers are in the areas of money management and psychology. These are the two most difficult areas to master. I'm not faulting you for leaving this up to the reader. Your intent has been to offer up great systems, for free! As has been said many times before, you can put a mediocre system in the hands of great trader and he will outperform the typical trader with a top system. Mastermind has offered up his pull back entry methods, which were greatly appreciated. I have heard it said that waiting on the pullback and then entering upon resumption of the trend can multiply annual profits by a factor of 4, when done correctly. Maybe a little more discussion in this area and on exit techniques would liven things up here on the thread. Thanks for your generosity in offering these excellent system! All the best, GDayMates

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Great results Almo and easily possible trading these volatiles! I know how you feel about lack of participation mate. You might begin to start thinking that they take but they do not give..... its a funny planet we live on..... Masterrmind...........

Thanks for responding to the PMs. I am one of the senders. I also invited other good coders to help out. Please if you know of a good coder, you can send a PM inviting him/her to look into this system. I believe in Almo's vision.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Khalil, I appreciate if you spare some time and make EA for this system. I am confident you can make very good EA on this system.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi Khalil , tnx for your response,i hope u will find the time to help us here, Cheers. Al.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hello Almo. I am very grateful for the systems you put here. please don't feel like we are not using it. I do use them. I have recently used your system to make x5 of an account. I hope that someday I will get similar results as yours. The fund small grow it big and withdraw method is very good. I can see the nice graph. I just have one question, did you get this result with the recent 15mins system or it was a combo of other of your systems? Though I await its automation, I have however started demo trading it manually. Thank You

--- 帖子 #459 ---
hi mate,the last results are from about 80 trades i did only the last version of the 15min sys,therefore i decided to release it,when i done to build system i always test it in real account and not on demo cause i want to feel the real deal of the mkt and the real deal is to take small acc and turn it into medium one or big one , i prefer to take 500 usd or 1k acc and turn it into 10k or above Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
​ Ok Almo, Thanks so much. I will do same thing on a live account God helping me.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
i did it cause i built this sys,, i suggest you first to learn it via demo then if u 100% sure on it bang it on real,also i hope coders will code it into EA it will be more easy and hope it will be precise as i know it need to be according the rules and values i gave, Cheers. Al.

Hi, Looks like a great system! Thanks for sharing it! May I ask if you changed the rules and dont care about the two indicators you had in the video any more(RSI histo and forexprofitsupremeFilter)? Regards nikki

--- 帖子 #464 ---
This candle should fulfill all the conditions for a good sell. at 1 : 1 we are looking at 400pips. ​

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hello Almo, I see two reasons why you want this system automated. 1. so anybody can use it. 2. so we will not miss out on opportunities when away from the system. I think we can solve a part of reason two while we await the EA. if we have up to 10persons that fully understand the system and willing to trade it. we can set up a group of say 10persons where we can notify ourselves when we have a signal. if you agree, I will be the second person in the group cos I fully understand the system. ​

--- 帖子 #466 ---
i am also in . i started trading this system and its profitable already locked almost 800 pips now .. an ea or an alert for this system when all conditions made will be a good one

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Yes mate iam in both GJ and GN.ABOUT 400 pips each.Cheers.Al

thanks rajkumar, looking back i see how that was the right entry. i guess we want the yellow adx line to cross 15 from below 10? i might have missed that if it was already mentioned by Almo.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
you are right thirdpillar ALMO rules are 100%mechanical and straight forward here he goes 1. RSI histro must to be below 5 and dark red for sell and opposite for buy 2. forex profit filter must be red for sell and opposite for buy 3. ADX yellow line must move in a sinusoidal form (he means a cycle) and should cross 15 4. the dmi lines + or - should to be above 25 lines and it should point up 5. cci should to be below 100 for sell and opposite for buy 6. rsi should to be below 30 for sell and opposite for buy he noted that ADX is the main tool and he suggested it must undergo his strong rule 3. and 4. to pull the trigger .

if this thread was more active i think traders probably could benefit from this strategy but i tired always to request from traders to share they insights and charts so i will leave it as it is. i see all over this forum lot of crap systems and EA's and i see the popularity of those threads and sometimes i dont believe how shit people can get into their brains ,i tested most of the EA's and systems just for curiosity and o boy lot of crap , my baby boy can build better systems.. in other hand i can tell also that there is several good systems as well GL traders .

You are on the right path Almo! At the end of the day all that really matters is that you build up a wealth bank for your family and yourself. Good karma will follow good people like you mate. Personally, I prefer to use what works in a system and discard what I see as not important and if it generates good trades then I apply the correct MM and make it work. I follow all of your threads Almo ........... ps. People choose to follow a certain thread for multiple reasons its not always about how great the system is sometimes it is horrendous but people continue to follow along because the interaction makes them somehow feel good about themselves. pps. I think we all know about interesting systems that look way outside the box but everyone is free to follow what they like. ppps. I also enjoy hitting a long TP on a few volatile pairs ..... just love it! Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I like your attitude about MM,you doing great and your TE is a prove.Cheers.Al.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
i use your system almo but indifferent way with a lots of indicator and thats why i feel shame to post my chart.but i love your system and also your personality man.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks Almo for sharing your system. I am still new with forex, and still finding a system I am comfortable with. First week on forex is good, I am making pip and losing some, but still quite confuse as to why? And finally on the 2nd week I am in, I busted my account. For the past month I read a lot from baby pips and FF. And when I came upon Price Action Topic thats when I finally understood the reason as how Forex works. I am so grateful to people like you who unselfishly share their systems. I have attached my first take on Lotus/Almo system, have I done it correctly? Trade was on TF15 ADX- yellow line coming from below above15 - red line above 25,000 -green line - below 15 CCI - below 100 pointing down RSI- below70 SL-recent highest point??am I correct here?

Hi Almo, I was the first one to PM you right after your coding request. But you never responded to my PM. So I thought you probably found somebody to code for you. And I NEVER asked for money!

Just a Rough Version without the 'Supreme Filter'. Lots of Conditions and Modifications needed yet. Followed the 'Lotus' rules with ADX=37 and CCI=70 and TP=5, SL=30 (1:6 RR !!!). Please check it on both Back &amp; Forward Test and find out where it's Failing (Hitting SL) and Why? This EA will Open Orders depending on the Last Closed Bar considering it has fulfilled all the Conditions. As I am not a Professional Programmer and not so efficient with coding, it will take time to put this one a workable figure. Please ignore the unnecessary Inputs.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
hello mate,i checked it and.. this EA didn't match the basic rule of the major indicator of the system the ADX! therefore its not good.. Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
You can change the ADX from EA's Input according to your system.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I know but its not meet the rule of cross the 25 and also the rule of new cycle by adx and crossing the 15 you can test it and see..

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Can you please provide a Screenshot of it indicating the spots where it's not working accordingly?

--- 帖子 #593 ---
just test it with the rules and the true parameters and u will see .. I am not at home right now but If u will test it on GJ pair since 2015 you will notice that.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Almo, I think there are some confusion about the "exit", at least I feel confused...... In your video you say either you exit at 1:1 or if the adx line go down under 25....... But as it seems you dont exit if the adx line (yellow line) goes under 25 very fast after it went over it. So please explain a little bit more, because I am confused, sorry !!! /nikki

--- 帖子 #595 ---

Hi mate , if you interest on trade system you have here already 5 rocking trading systems that I built, I each one of them you will look if you will search that I made same results as the above announcement Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
you also rock the MKT with my 5/15 system I guess Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
AL, I use all of your systems. All Great work. used the LOTUS to get X10 of my account. I am now using the 1min system. I hope to achieve your kind of result soon. Thanks so much. I think we want to run from the truth in FX: the truth that you have to work hard to earn hard. ​

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Much respect to Almo. I am going to be trading the Lotus full time live. Does anyone care to join me in skype group. Please PM me user name. Must know the Lotus system inside out and been trading it to join. I WILL ASK QUESTIONS. I am open to other good systems by Almo. Then we can ping each other when we see setups on the pairs mentioned by Almo. Looking forward to having 1 or 2 full time traders along with me. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hello All First I really thank you ALMO2312 Bro. its really very helpful thread to all newbie person. if you dont mind ALMO bro i have some quarries abt yous system so plz if possible make a SKYPE / TELEGRAME group also. its easy to all for quarires / understand yous system. Thank you

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I can build a free EA if you want

--- 帖子 #642 ---
I've been trying to grasp everything from the posts and was wondering which system would you recommend I start with? If you had to choose one of your systems, which one would you choose?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
you can start with the lotus system cos it has a video that makes it easier to understand.​

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi can you post the video or the site thanks

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi,sorry to say this but your gann lines are useless because meta trader 4 cannot scale price with time which is ESSENTIAL when working with gann lines. Incompetence at the hands of the developers for it even being there on the platform, as the platform cannot scale price with time. any bounces on your gann lines on your chart are just random. There are a lot of platforms which have gann lines but have no way of scaling price and time. If you want software capable of that you will probably have to pay for it. master analyst 7 is the one software package i know that can definately scale price with time and it's not cheap.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
The video is on the first post on this page. The YouTube link is the video.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hello Almo I think you are ANGRY with us. we are SORRY bcz last two days we all are waiting for your update. plz come and teach to us and continue your thread as a teacher. Thanks

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hi ALMO i used your system for 2 weeks . i open BUY trade when candles closed above all indicator and also opposite situation for SELL order . it is very good for me but i need to know how much tp should i take for that pairs you said on page 1 . and how do you define entry point? also can you update your system with indicators and template you are using now . thank you

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Maybe this post will get me deleted here. Hopefully... Why do people not start using their brains..? Come on guys .. show a little respect to the people here that are willing to share .. it´s easy just think I´m getting sick of reading the same bullshit every time i´m on here. Where should i Take profit , where should i set my Stop Loss. You OP got to show me...damnit..look at your goddamn chart , make some backtests then you will come up with numbers that you either like or not.. Nobody is responsible for your success or failure..only yourself. If you really think you´ll get anywhere with the same robotical sizes..you are not only lazy (not reading, not trying) then you are dumb too. Can someone...of you lazy bitches now be so kind to report my post to Twee (for rude language or whatever) so i can get my account deleted... Messaged Twee more than once to do it... But i think every Usernumber counts for advertising deals... *meh*

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Excellent post. I fully support you.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
so many useless threads with thousands of posts and a good one like this is redundant, thats sad this is one of the only systems that have made live results like this, sonic r and co were just popular failures, hope almo comes back soon

--- 帖子 #652 ---
So true. What I like the most about them(the systems) is that they are so easy to learn and follow. This thread has greatly increased my profitability. i am really working it hard to get Almo's kind of result. i think its redundant because we run away from Work. These system demand time and effort which many don't want to give. Though having Almo as a coach is great but i think we have not been the best of students. He gave us an assignment to write an EA to trade the lotus system. Till date, we have not submitted it. ​

--- 帖子 #653 ---
what's up mate ,yes .. lazy traders definitely don't success at this kind of business , as you know I gave here also lot of explanations and well. Also video what I asked for return ..,just to keep this thread alive and to share trades.., I really wanted to share my last system that can be use for 15/30 min time frame but honestly got out of the share momentum .. Cheers mate and GR8 weekend. Al.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
hope you share soon is the marked signal a good buy signal?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I've been following this thread for a long time, and I think I have a strong chemistry with this system I just want to share that I've made around 1000+ pips with Lotus system, and I'm happy with that result, so far this is the best system I've ever try, and I will continue to use this system for my trading. I will try to code this system for free, I have basic MQL4 and i will share my EA for free in this forum, because I feel what almo feel right now.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
best system ever the Buy on gbpaud i was asking about above has moved over 230 pips in a day no wonder almo rakes such returns cause of all the 3 signals i have identified none has done below 150 pips

--- 帖子 #657 ---
this strat is a strat that can deliver a 1000 pips ina week , funny good things are hidden, while weak system are broadcasted and hyped

--- 帖子 #658 ---

WOW! Almo, you are the best trader I have met yet. I have been challenged greatly by you to be a very profitable trader too. In fact, Today I will open and start an explorer trade like you with $80 and apply your 5mins trading system I tweeted a little. I want to do this to encourage all your other students like myself that its possible to trade like you. Though I will be trading on any currency pair, as I see it works on all pairs from my test. So lets get this going. Thanks once More 'Coach'​

Hi mate, i play with small money as start capital (usually 100usd) to gain several K's so i play with high leverage sometimes i success sometimes its failed , but when i success usually i got 5k and than withdraw it as i did from 200 usd to 6k also i mention several times not to be follow cause its to risk as well for those that cant effort themselves to loose 100 usd i play with high leverage cause with small capital for gain several K's within short period one must play with HL , anyway don't bother yourself its ok from my side, Cheers and trade well Al.

Hello Almo, I'm new to the boards, been a scalper for a few years, was lurking around your posts to see if your system can help capture a few more pips than scalping does, one question though do you enter the trade on a pullback if you miss the original signal or would you wait for a new signal, on the 1m sys Attached Image (click to enlarge)

its depend on the S/R zones Cheers Al.

Hey, mate. I would say 1:100 leverage is not very high, last time I've gained some money had it around 1:1000 with more leverage power. Of course, I didn't last so I wasted 30 USD. Anyways, I would love to understand your strategy but I'm struggling!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
truly remarkable trading Almo.... I love your high leverage strategy, with a reliable system like you have you can continue to replicate this. I am still trying to master the 1 minute and lotus systems but I had to commend you on your efforts.... I look forward to seeing your posts and charts, they are good motivation for beginners like me

Lotus remains one of the most powerful strats i have seen, the way it stays clear of giving mulitple signals and just observes the market in ranges from the sidelines is cool

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Can anybody help me to fix my problem post #787 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...13#post9026913 ?

--- 帖子 #798 ---
it is an indicator and there is no need to edit it in meta trader editor. You only edit Expert Advisors in mt4 if they come in mql4 format and not ex4. As a side note.. you should have this indicator in the indicator folder of mt4 not in expert advisor folder.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
This might actually work for WTI...or maybe just luck

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Hi Almo ! First of all thanks for the great work and sharing it with the FF community. Regarding your sytems I have the following questions : 1. How many pairs are you trading simultaneously to achieve your monthly 2000 pips goal ? 2. Regarding money management it would be nice to see how a trading account can be increased with conservative position sizing (e.g. 1-2 % account size) This will be interesting especially for your 1min and 15 min Lotus system. Thanks in advance and carry on Bernhard

--- 帖子 #801 ---
When I want to add this indicator (and others) they crash my mt4 software, how to fix this problem? What is your build mt4?

--- 帖子 #802 ---
have you tried downloading a fresh copy of the indicator that fails.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Not sure if this will correct every error, but change char to Char. It needs capital "C" now.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Thank you for your answers. I tried with an other broker and an other mt4 software and the indicators work fine, no problem.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
tested it and works no errors

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Almo, Are you still testing this solution.

Hi Thanks Alamo for sharing your work, just a quick a question about lotus system, whts the typical time to trade using it ?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
OK traders this is the 5min GJ GU system , we can use it from Asian open till UK close , on friday i trade it till USA open for not be stuck over the weekend we can trade it also on the one min time frame and i will put here differ tpl for the one min called "1" NOW! i am very very hope u traders will share your charts and this is only for you friends to learn this system cause if u dont do it u will never learn how to use this system , TP/SL as your wish,consider P/S/R! , the system provide the entry signal and its bring 50 pips easily on each trade but sometimes i ride it for more as i look always for next S/R to breaking up next PLEASE ALWAYS CONSIDER P/S/R ZONES!!! (the system not recommended for rookies on forex) now i will put here the zip file ,inside it there is the 55 tpl for the 5min and also i will put the one min tpl as well explain will be next post Cheers and GL (been tested for about 3 yrs ) looking very good Al.

ok thanks almo, preparing to learn the new system hehe I was regret for sleeping earlier because yesterday GA and GN had signal on lotus system, and I didn't took it at all

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Watch your r:R as its not very good in this trade. Look left at chart structure the entry you made was right on support (what happened to price last time this level was hit .... it bounced UP right?) Your entry added unnecessary DD to your trade (look at the chart) Then you exited the trade right when PA had just broken down below support (look left again). Why did you decide to exit a trade that looked to be heading lower? Possibly you would have ended with a much better r:R ratio than the one you got. Comments are meant to help you not annoy you. I hope you take these comments the right way which is to help you and not criticize you. Good trading, Masterrmind............ :nerd:

very valid points some of which i noticed after i had placed the trade thanks

--- 帖子 #820 ---
nice one Almo, looking forward to the explanation

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Most traders fall victim to these types of errors however, the market will also throw a curve ball at you that defies logic. Most of the time an awareness of PA will lead the way to profit BUT not always so you always need to keep a watch over your MM. WE are all here to help each other so onward and upward. Take care, Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Very nice. I will try it and post the feedback.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
use the tpl I put at the video post

--- 帖子 #843 ---
thanks Almo your a good man helping others

--- 帖子 #844 ---
So, if i understand correctly, today screen, though the candle break the range, as it didnt satisfy other conditions, it is not a good entry.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
excellent understanding

--- 帖子 #846 ---
focus on only that one and pls charts charts charts

--- 帖子 #847 ---
and as you can see on real time its deal with false break signals, lately the GJ is very ranging and choppy

--- 帖子 #848 ---
yea i think so based on his video

--- 帖子 #849 ---
focus on which one please

--- 帖子 #850 ---
That is right. False breakout or false entries are the ones which will amount to too many losses most of the time.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
I meant its better to focus with this strategy only on GJ but if u guys wanna test it on other pairs its your own decision

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Am looking GU. It looks like it satisfied conditions in this 5 mins candle. Obviously focus was on GJ, but GU met conditions. I am taking the trade. Lets see how it works out.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
you have S1 there!!let it break then ride for the next S ALSO I told trade only the GJ SO ITS YOUR OWN DESICION GL mate

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I didn't observe S1. Pivot Lines, have to notice them. My luck, it crossed the S1 now.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
GJ- 5min, IS it a good signal. Based on rules, conditions seem to be right for SELL Signal.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Working on That

--- 帖子 #857 ---
yes, thank you very much almo I will try it next week, because tomorrow is saturday

--- 帖子 #858 ---
gr8 mate, sent u msg on whatsup and Skype Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
yes I there as well and also wait for session 2 Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
How do we understand that the session has ended/ trend changed/ ranging price? I see now it's going up, or at least stopped selling, GJ pair always speaking

--- 帖子 #861 ---
I explained all in video pls watch very carefully and listen to the explain.its here.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
GU wasnt bad. It is still going on with 70 pips.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hi, About your GBPJPY chart, the RSI HistAlert didn't cross the level -3 to go short?. Regards

--- 帖子 #864 ---
thank you, point noted.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
well I didn't mentioned it but because its high value on RSI(600!) so enough to be red -1/-1.5 for sell so its ok Cheers there is logical issue there Al.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Thanks, I will change the level to +1/-1, anyway this was a very big red candle, it is difficult to have a good RR, where to set the SL?, for me I wait for another setup, maybe a break for the low of the very big candle. Regards

--- 帖子 #867 ---
I closed GU with +70 pips and GJ - +35 pips. I put trail stop with 5 pips after London Close time. Nice setup, not too much drawdown, if all conditions are met.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Thank you Almo2312 for all your share ! Great job !

--- 帖子 #869 ---
busy week ahead, Lotus did well last week and has always been doing well left good trades early and need to work on discipline still studying the 55 and GJ templates

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Thanks for the new template almo, pity gbp is ranging today, will try it tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hello traders , I am new to the forum. At the beginning I would like to thank Almo for sharing their systems and to all who give in this thread. Does anyone could explain how to play the Lotus? Preferably with concrete examples. Thank you very much for help.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
read the whole thread i guess, because there's a lot of example and almo has been explained in a video in this thread hmm, bad luck for gbp today, will try tomorrow

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Looks like second session has crossed the 2 Ranges. Only Schaff M5 need to go down below 10. Almo, are you looking at this trade. So this is a false breakout.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Now all conditions Met. Correct me if am wrong, so that it can improve and help others as well. Testing Support level is the only Question?

--- 帖子 #886 ---
well done mate,!! Lotus + continuation on GJ5min gave u nice start for today I also done for today as I will not continue to the next session , Research showed me that the first session is more stable so I limited it onto only one session and validation of trades only till 5pm GMT+3 , so I look only the breaking of the range from 00 to 8 am (GMT+3) Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
yap I agree with you, because last week on friday, the second session is not going well, took only about 25 pips well, I'm happy with your system I have a desire to convert your system, especially the lotus one, into an EA but I'm not able to convert it because it's too complicated for me So, I'm so sorry mate

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Thanks Almo for sharing this great system. I will test this system with my live account tommorow. In fact this GJ is a very volatile pair, it is a bit dangerous for me. However, after going through your trading system, I am interested in it and will try it. But in my opinion, the best thing is to target 50 pips everyday. In order to reduce lost pips.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Oh by the way, my broker is 3 hour GMT plus, Is it just correct if I do not change any time zone setting?

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Hi friends I tested the last strategy that I published also on GU and UJ UJ from 2013 till today GU from 2013 till today there is different tpl's and its not like the GJ tpl but its the same concept same idea the only different is the time for the range also on GU the research showed me that not recommended to trade on Friday and Monday (for better results!) and also the validation to trade is till 5pm(GMT+3)the range we look to break is from 9am to 1pm (GMT+3) average TP for GU is from 40 to 100 pips and recommended SL is 90 pips (also always look for S/R zones!) GU FROM 2013 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) on UJ we look for breaking the range from 12am to 2pm(GMT+3) also research showed me that not recommended to trade on Friday also the validation for trade is till 5pm(GMT+3) average TP for UJ is from 45 to 80 pips and recommended SL is 80 pips UJ FROM 2013 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) this is the tpl for UJ and GU Attached File(s) GU5MINALMO.tpl 75 KB | 469 downloads Attached File(s) UJ5MINALMO.tpl 76 KB | 420 downloads now after all the effort I put here for you friends I want to see here charts for the relevant systems this only way you friends will success Cheers and trade wisely Al.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Almo , thank you for the new tpl !! For a good understanding - we are looking for braking with a blue rectangle? If this is not a problem , then please also add a red rectangle - is very helpful . Once again, thank you Bardo . Regards.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
the lowest indicator is not showing in my template, any advice?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Great job, you are working really hard just to help us!! That is awesome, we all have many things to learn from you. Keep up the good work. Guys we have our duty now as per Almo's request, we have to post our charts showing our trades taken as per his template uploaded above. Lets make this system the most stable system that just give us green pips only.. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
nice one Almo, Thanks

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Almo, thank you for sharing these systems. They are a little bewildering at first and I've only just wrapped my head around your Lotus strategy. Your video explained the rules perfectly, thank you. I look forward to sharing some charts and learning the other systems.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
EURGBP from 2011 till today its also different tpl Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) here we look to break the range from 12am to 1pm (GMT+3) same condition for buy/sell as I explained before recommended TP is from 15 to 50 pips , recommended SL is 30 pips , not recommended to trade at Friday and validation to trade is till 3pm (GMT+3) Cheers Al.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
LOTUS Is a strong system and so all of almos templates imagine 100 pips plus on GBPCHF sell today

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Congrats Mate.....

--- 帖子 #899 ---
First trade on Lotus Hope it's a good entry..

--- 帖子 #900 ---
and the last one - GA short

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Lotus is still best. And Almo, i think EA is better with trailstop to make it breakeven. If entry is delayed, then advantage such a good system is all gone. If we enter the trade at the right time, then there is literally very little drawdown. I have to learn programming to make this EA. this is so good, and we can capitalize far better.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
EURUSD ... 2014 till now....

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Good luck Almo it looks very interesting . I Also write EA's ,and now testing my Robots, I came here to learn &amp; educate. God speed to us all Shay

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Couldn't sleep,so I used the opportunity to watch the video and go through the updates!Nice one guys.Rozay chop knuckle!

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Lotus EA might need extra work

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Thanks Rozay, May be if you attache Mql4 file, someone can also assist in editing and improving the version. But very good work. I will test it.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
On GJ &amp; UJ, results are very nice. I reduced TP to 30 and SL at 70, and M5. M15 was also good, but little lower than M5. EU, my test results werent that good. GU, was decent.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hi Almo, thanks for sharing your system. I really appreciate what you are doing and your contribution to the forex community. I am relatively new to forex and your system looks very promising. Got a 3 signals last night and took them. So far closed out 75 pips on your 1 minute system. thank you again and I wish you good luck on your EA if you can find someone to code it for you. kleine

--- 帖子 #909 ---
anyone who took this?

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Can you share the EA please

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Rozay has shared the EA, read all posts, you will get answers.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
What would be the entry trigger for this trade? Thanks

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Hi, PJSantos100 could you please post your settings.? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Dear All, I am new to this forum and i come across this thread which i find it interesting.. i have upload the #15.tpl which i have uploaded the screen shot here. May i know whether anyone of you still using the tpl? and if so what is the entry and exit? Sorry sorry, i went through the thread but cant find anything that is related to #15.tpl

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Here's my chart for the 15M strategy on TradingView, plots arrows and alerts. Although you'll need to verify "forex profit filter" on MT4, can't replicate that on TradingView; but alternative MMAR indicator works well to confirm trend, also need to make sure DI+/DI- is pointing upward or downward. https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GB...-15M-STRATEGY/ Click the share button icon, then "Make it Mine" to copy the chart.

Lotus still rocking, still growing accounts

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hello everyone, Hopefully, Almo will be back to help and teach us more especially for some of us that just discovered his great thread. Meanwhile, I could see that all of his videos have been taken out. So I want to suggest that if anyone can help put all of Almo's systems together each with his own rules and if possible with charts in a PDF or MS word, so we that are new can get to understand the system without asking questions while reading and also able to refer new traders to the exact post when they ask questions. I think it will be great that way at least to keep his thread on, please guys help. Kindest regards. NerryP.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Rozay, Who wrote this EA, Looks like there is a small mistake. It is taking BUY when it is supposed to take SELL and it takes SELL when it needs to take BUY. Some issue with Logic here. Can you check.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
ok

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Guys, Almo has done a great job with the systems he has freely shared here. I was one of the ones who was late to the party so I didn't get to see the Lotus video before it was taken down. I have managed to piece together the rules from the thread however the one missing piece for me is how you determine your SL level for the Lotus M15 system. If anyone would be so kind as to share any insights it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I think this image describes it well:

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Where is this system to download?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
If you look at the top of this thread you will see a 'paperclip' symbol. Click on that and look for the download entitled 'lotus.rar'

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Thanks very much Speculator10! That sums it up very nicely indeed! Green pips to you!

--- 帖子 #469 ---
There is activity and interest.... :-)

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Almo could you please make available the video again?
