I have been trading forex for 9 years, and my favorite time frame is the 1 min

--- 帖子 #2 ---
I will post indicators and a template on Monday

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Sounds good, I look forward to this as I have found trading in the one minute time frame to be to nerve racking for me

--- 帖子 #4 ---
@ iono, if 1 min trades last for 20 to 45 minutes.  understand how it can be nerveracking. If you watch a 15 min chart reversals happen pretty regular every 45 minutes.  Trade the 1 min on these reversals and you are golden

Most people think trading the 1 min charts happens so quickly that you dont have time to think, but just watch the 1 min charts for a while and you will see that 1 min swings last for longer than you would think. You just need a good setup to get into the swings with a small stop loss.

Charts to follow

I have a unique way of looking at the markets, especially forex, which is 1 of the best trending vehicles you can trade.  All you need to do is learn how to find a trend and then trade the heck out of it in the direction of a higher time frame.

If you will indulge me for a few months and pay attention to what I am trying to tell you, you will have an advantage that will be yours for many years to come.

I am trading the 1min at the moment in the direction of the larger trend - and the biggest issue i see is waiting for a large enough pullback before entry.  What i will be interested in is seeing how you determine the best levels at which to trade reversals back into the larger trend.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
First lesson is we need to know the direction of the 15 min

I am convinced that Heiken ashi smoothed indicators give you a distinct advantage in finding direction on any time frame

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Trading is all about finding a setup that fits your eye visually.  Trading is a visual game with lots of help from indicators, and they do work very well if you put the correct indicators with the correct time frames.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Am i correct to suggest that you would not have taken the first setup as the chart was still in a downtrend at that time?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
You are not correct in assuming anything at the moment, since I have not finished showing you my setup.  Be patient, trading is a waiting game for the right opportunity.

HH

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I would like to set your minds at ease, this is not a prelude to selling something, or giving you bits and pieces and then requiring you to join a paid subscription to find out the meat of the system.   It is going to be a piece by piece information on a very profitable short term trading method that I have been using for years, and have been fortunate enough to add bits and pieces to it to make it a very easy method to trade.

HH

--- 帖子 #12 ---
The next thing that is of paramount importance, is to find a daily average indicator that is fairly accurate.  We are only going to trade pairs that average more than 100 pips a day.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Keep going my friend, I like what I see.  I've heard that the 1min chart is career suicide over and over again so I'm interested to see what you work with.

I have already learned something new just by viewing your chart you showed above.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I want to caution anyone who reads this thread, I am not going to answer stupid questions, or go over anything again.

If you want to learn something from this thread read it and go over it until you understand it.

I will give all the information to you a bit at a time and if you pay attention you will be able to trade any time frame that you wish to trade, the emphasis being put on the 1 min time frame. If you pay attention you can adjust a few indicators and trade this method on any time frame.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks for the kind word Lefty

--- 帖子 #16 ---
As i mentioned before I look at the market differently than most of the guru's that profess to be teachers.

For the 5 min to change direction the 1 has to change first, and for the 15 to change direction the 1 and the 5 have to change first. Most of the gurus that teach forex  preach from the top down in trading, example, watch the 4 hr to trade the 1 hr....

What I am looking for is a 1 min trade to turn into a 5 min trade, and a 5 min trade to turn into a 15 min trade etc etc....

The upper time frame direction is important to trade the lower time frames, but the lower time frames change direction first

Does that make sense

--- 帖子 #17 ---
After all that being said, LOL, I am always looking to convert a lower time frame trade into a longer timeframe trade,,,why????? it should be obvious,

Lower risk means more gains.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Can we name this scalping? I used M1 and M5 too for short time trading, and always look for H1 or M30 for the real trending...

As a short time trader, stockastic and RSI is needed.. and for sure, I avoid the US session.. M1 is just a whipsaw in US session...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Something tells me here is enough "meat" to satiate our hunger for pips......

Lookin' forward to know more.....

Thanks for sharing bro!

Btw. Why thread has been moved from "Trading System"?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Really good stuff...

hharrington, keep talking!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
That's what I would like to know too.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I have no idea why thread was moved, but here is the next step in becoming a "Scalper if you wish" or trading on any time frame.

If you have been around the markets long enough you probably have figured out there are some key times to trade..sessions, or whatever you choose to call them.

Take the 15 min chart and put some daily open lines on them (all times EST) time zone.) Figure it out with your broker.

Make them different colors, I use red for 5 pm open, Blue for 7PM open, Green for 2 am open, Lime for London 3 am open, and yellow for 8 am NY open or choose any colors that fit you.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Add the line chart and make it a color you can easily see, Now your charts should look like this. I guess we will call this chart No 2 etc etc as we progress.

Hey people I did not say I was a great teacher lol. This is a learning experience for me also, trying to convey in a short time to you, which took me years to learn.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I neglected to mention that during asia, the Aussie Dollar is one of my favorite pairs to trade.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
If you notice, Asia took price down on the AU, and the 2 am open stopped it in its tracks. Now we will wait and see what london wants to do on this pair

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Presently my 6 favorite pairs to trade are AU, AJ, EU, EJ, GU, and last but not least the UC. This changes, because I check on all pairs for currencies that are trading over 100 pips per day.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I also like eur/aud, and gpb/chf, but 6 pairs will give you more than ample opportunities to make pips every day.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
For those of you who would like to trade longer term, the 15 min should provide many opportunities.  I really like the 1 hr and 4 hr for my longer term trading.

On this chart I put a rectangle on the 15 min move, in the near future we are going to look at this area on a lower time frame charts.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
@ Magusa, call it anything you like, it is a method of trading which should benefit anyone who takes the time to read this stuff.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
My purpose for starting this thread is to hopefully, convey enough information to new, and unsuccessful old traders alike, to become a successful trader on any time frame you choose to trade.

I am not interested in how you trade or what your setups are, all I want to do is share my trading ideas. Take what you will out of it and use it or discard it.

HH

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I'm following. So far it's an interesting approach. I can see the potential.

Thanks

Peter

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Let me know if you can read these charts.

Looking at the 5 min chart on the 15 min swing

--- 帖子 #33 ---
London open finally joined the downward trend on AU, time to take some profits and go to bed. If I have good trades from Asia, I dont trade London or NY.

The best time to trade in my opinion is London thru noon on NY.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Charts are certainly readable.

Can you post your version of the 123 semaphore sometime- it seems much cleaner than the copies I have.

Also your fib tool. Is it the standard MT4 one with additions, or a different one?

Thanks

Peter

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Absolutely Mystic, in the near future.  Fibs I made myself from reading Bobokus fib trading thread on FF

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Very interesting!  just one question, what is the white line that follows the price like a Moving Average?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks ,iam gonna try this out on the jse alsi and see what happens??

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Funny I've traded as low as 15min when I first started out, attempted 5 with support and resistance...I like the trend line on the 15min then pull back to a five watch for the break and take a few pips, like the thread keep it up.

Thanks

as the old adage goes drop by drop fills the pot

--- 帖子 #39 ---
@ Joancb, that is a stupid question read post 23, if you dont know what a line chart is go back to babypips before you return

--- 帖子 #40 ---
@ mystic, Peter yes I will post a fib template, LET ME REITERATE, I will not waste my time to answer stupid questions about stuff that has been gone over already in the thread.  READ THE GD THREAD. I trade full time.

Attached semafor indicator, also in template is the swing fib, when you load the template your semafors should resemble mine

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Here you go Peter

--- 帖子 #42 ---
More goodies,,,a little confirmation for our entries

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Another picture on the 5 min charts with some good info.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Now you should have all the indicators you need to practice with this chart setup on the 5 min.  If you have a favorite indicator or 2 to confirm with feel free to use it. These are the ones I like.

HH

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Set your mtf stochastics 1 or 2 time frames up from the tf you want to trade

--- 帖子 #46 ---
It seems to me a nice job done here....

If I've understood it right, you wait for a 3 ball, then a macd cross, then set your entry @ 23 reverse level of fibo (providing you have a HH or LL). Or you wait fror a bounce from fibo 23?

Plz. can you specify better the second entries in this chart?

Regarding HA. You use it to stay in the trade, but...when do you get out from it? When HA changes color, or when price closes below or so?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
@ aztrader, rules to trade will be forthcoming.

I use fib levels a lot for targets,,,especially the 1.382 ext. and the 1.618 ext.

On the 15 min and above, I use an EA called Magic Stick, for entries. which is a line cross by X amount of pips adjustable EA.  Great tool for exiting trades also.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I have not gotten to the 1 min setup to trade yet. When I have then all the instructions will have been completed.

HH

--- 帖子 #49 ---
The HA smoothed looks great for the location of a trailing stop - thanks for that!

Also the idea regarding the turning of a shorter timeframe trade into a longer timeframe trade is also a very good one.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Here we go folks, my 1 min trading setup.  I would like to say, please put some Daily open lines on your charts and watch price action around those lines.  5pm 7pm 2am 3am, and of course NY at 8 am since I live on the East Coast.

A lot of trades start and end around those lines.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
The last indicator to complete the template.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Some trading rules,

The only way to become proficient at something is to practice it. I have been trading 1 min charts for 10 or more years, so don't expect too much to begin with.

With some time in front of charts, you will start to see how the swings begin and end on the 1 min tf.  Good luck and patience is your friend.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I shoot for 5 or more pips on the 1 min charts, and usually take all the trades both directions unless we are in a runaway trend, then I just trade in the direction of the trend.

To begin with I think you should just trade with the trend. Time trading this method will allow you to be more agressive.

Always trade these setups with a tight stop, whatever your broker will allow you.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
@ Sarythsaya, yes thanks.

If you draw a trend line along the HA on a 15 min chart and trade them and use them for exits, you can make a lot of pips.

HH

--- 帖子 #55 ---
So, you suggest to enter on a 1 Min chart....and then try to follow 15 min chart for the exit?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
@ AZTRADER2

Read post 54

If a 1 min trade keeps going, lets say for 20 or 30 pips, then I would check out the higher tf, 5 min and put a stop at BE or for a few pips positive, and let it run on the 5, if meanwhile the 15 had reversed I would most definate entertaint the thoughts of a 15 min trade.

As I mentioned before the 1, 5, have to change direction to be a 15 min trend unless we are already in a 15 min trend.

I frequently trade the 15 min, and when I am in a positive trade on the 15 I scale in or scalp the 1 or the 5 minute in the same direction

--- 帖子 #57 ---
If you had a line marking the London Open this morning, I had a trade long on the 1 min going long, which turned into a 5 min trade, and then on the 5 min reversed back to the open.

Everyone be aware of these setups, many many time when price takes off from the open line in either direction for 40 or 50 pips we get a pullback to the open for equal pips...2 easy trades to spot if you watch it for a while

This is a typical move of the big boys to set the high or low of the day, then its easy to trade in the direction of the 15 or 1 hr charts.

I will put a pending order 10 pips below the London open if this trades around the open for a while, or look for the reversal back long again.

When 2 or 3 open lines all get together we are in for a big move in 1 direction

EUR/USD

--- 帖子 #58 ---
In conclusion, I like to see price in this setup. They usually get you hooked in 1 direction like this move up on EU and then run the price in the other direction, It looks like we presently are going back to the NY open

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i will be thank full to u if u make a Rar folder of u r indicator n Tpl file

Semafor Repaints?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Interesting concept.

That smoothed Heiken hashi use? I see that is not uploaded.

It is clear that many systems in the signals come in late, leading to step back and sweeps stops.

1 min TF does not mean that we will do many operations and we went crazy, must be seen as opportunities to go forth to the general movement.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thanks for the answer bro......

I wasn't @ the screen, but the big move happened as you expected....

And thanks for sharing this method. I think it's one of the few with indis that works....

--- 帖子 #63 ---
one question in 1min TF where do we place the stoploss above the # 3 ball, if above # 3 ball do we have to add spread? whats the Rules in R:R

--- 帖子 #64 ---
one question about the daily open lines what are we looking for? are we looking for the reaction of the PA If we have to exit our trade  or hold on our  trade and also were looking for good reversal entry?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Are you creating any manual for this? I am interested in learning more about your system?

Thanks.

That's a very ignorant statement by those who make it.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I am not going to make a pdf or trading manuel. If you would like me to do that PM me and I will think of a price I should charge to do this

If you read the thread, you would not need to ask questions.

Let me say this, and it will probably answer some of the questions asked in here.

The daily open lines are strong support and resistance places during a 24 hour period of trading. They give you clues about where price is going. Like I said in that post watch them and you will gain some valuable information from them alone.

Trading is a very visual thing. The same things happen over and over and over again. If you can grasp this concept then you will start to see the market in a way that benefits you.  Screen time is the only way to see these moves... there is no Holy Grail to trading, although I think Heiken ashi candles are the closet thing to it.

Dont be lazy read between the lines.  The info I have given in this tread already is worth many pips.

HH

--- 帖子 #68 ---
To see what I am talking about the EU entered on my 10 pip pending order below the London Open this morning and fell for over 100 pips.

All you needed to trade this move is a trend line below the heiken ahsi, on the last upmove on the 15 min,,,the NY open Line and the London open line forced the reversal.

I banked 70 pips on the move, with a trend line exit EA

If you dont understand what I am talking about, go back to babypips

HH

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Your rules are everywhere.  It would be nice if you have them in just one post.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
For those people who have not read the thread, there are two graphic illustrations in the thread about trading rules, and you ask for a manual.

Lucky, You could not trade any time frame if you believe everything you read.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I am not going to call trades in this room, all I am trying to do is show anyone who wants to listen a very very profitable trading method. The concepts and the basic tools are here. Its up to you to decide if you can use them for your benefit.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Plz HH don't be so rude with newbies....

You're making a good job here, sharing your knoweledge and helping us becoming better traders. Myself today banked about 40 pips thanks to your teachings....

But you must understand we are all under pressure.... most of us wander from a thread to another looking for the "RIGHT" way to knoweledge...

People appears and disappears here in FF or other forums telling us they know the way.....

Time passes by and we have our minds full of fake and/or useless informations, and isn't easy to make a "washout" of it, concentrate into the new thread understand new concepts and believe to the guy who started it.

So, it's possible somethimes people doesn't understand immediately the concepts, needs repetitions or makes dumb questions....

Trading is patience it's true...... but Teaching is more patience....

You can say: I don't wanna teach.... wanna just share.... In this case, better you write down  "that" pdf with all informations & rules and let people do by themseves......

But I see you try to make us understand the way you see the market, so, you're teaching us...

Nobody forced you to do it, so we appreciate it very much...

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I am not a good teacher AZ.  Please understand if you are too G..........D lazy to read the thread and then ask stupid questions, I dont care if you are a seasoned trader or a newbie.....take it somewhere else.

This information is free for those who will take advantage of it. as I mentioned in the beginning of the thread...read  and read again. People already asked me for stuff that is already in the thread.

I will not put up with that...just my nature, hopefully we are adults that show up in here.

I would be more than happy to answer intelligent questions about trading, but to go over stuff that is already here NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

For the jerks that say indicators repaint get lost,,,,most of them do...learn what they do and how to use them

--- 帖子 #77 ---
By the way AZ good Job

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hey Aztrader,

If you are jumping from thread to thread looking for the perfect trading system or the perfect set of rules you will most likely be doing this forever and not actually start trading profitably.

You need to filter out all the fuzz and get down to business by making your own set of rules, therefore making your own system. The simpler the better. I think most people would be surprised how simple a system can be and still be profitable.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
For the newbies, look at HH post #78, in the top right hand corner it shows "146 posts" (atm) click on that number and it will list all of HH posts.

Read them all in a row, make a list and you have the rules, maybe you could even attach it to a post for others to read

HTH

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Ye actually go look at all his posts starting at the start and you can see for someone that has a bad attitude about answering questions that are already in the thread he asks alot of questions himself

I could go on but you get my meaning so get off your high horse if your gonna do this thread

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Jumping from thread to thread doesn't necessarily means changing a thread every day....

You start reading a thread wich seems interesting, or is new. Maybe the first one is very big & the second must evolve itself...... This process takes time: You must read, select useful posts from useless ones, understand what's happening, setting up your charts, and try.... make mistakes, correct them....and after a lot of time, discover that system is a crap.....

Someone sips informations....telling us we must be ready to understand the next ones... And I've just lost > than a month following a guy who started right, but ended wrong.....because he had more thinghs to do....!?!? He uses (let's say) 5 elements in his method....but after a month (and >300 posts, and private mails, and skype sessions) we were still at the first two....!?!? F... it!

Or, maybe, the thread starter disappears....... or maybe, many people come into thread and start to say "this thing is wrong", "this doesn't works" and so on..... or make dumbs questions.... in any cases, the thread starter become upset, and starts to be rude, and more, and more.... and the thread dies.....

And last, but not least many of us are not of english mother language, so is easy to make mistakes reading or writing complicated stuffs...

And, at the end of the process...we must listen to a guy who says: YOU MUST DO IT YOUR OWN SYSTEM!

I don't wanna say we must be spoonfeded of course....

We must use our minds to understand critically what is exposed, and make our own conclusions about it.

What I wanna say (plz HH don't misunderstand me...it's not directed to you), generally speaking, is that NOBODY FORCES ANYBODY to share here his knoweledge.

But If one decides to do it (and I don't know what are his reasons to do that), he should be clearer as possible, avoiding confusion and misunderstanding, should be patient with newbies, give good examples of what he says, and help others to correct mistakes.

If not so.... I guess why he came here? What are the obscure reasons that forced him to start a thread telling us he knows how to do..... but ending telling us we are all dumbass and we must do it by ourselves?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Thanks bro.....

btw, I correct myself: 50, not 40 pips......

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Please attach your Heiken Ashi smoothed indicator and settings. Thanks

AZ,

I'm not suggesting you do it any particular way, as you say - it's up to you!

I was only trying to help by giving my opinion, sorry!

This thread is great, I'm not dissing anybody.

Good Luck!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
HH, dont know what motivated you to share, but my heartfelt thanks for all the effort that takes.  One of the best complements i could pay anyone is as follows:   You must be a very nice guy. Chow for now. Ron

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Right on Johnny H,,,keep it simple stupid.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Subscribing to see how this plays out.

But I'm wondering what settings the 3 balls are.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
this is a good entry for today ...

We just need to enter when accompanied by the sema3 in 15min and 5min?

1min not to enter at a sema3 opposite to higher timeframes?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Another entry for today, +40 pips.

But,against the sema3 of 15 and 5 min TF

Adjust your mtf indicators up 1 time frame from the longer term charts,

15 min uses 60 min mtf indicators

1 hr uses 4 hr

4 hr uses daily etc etc.

experiment and use what works best for you.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
2 additional indicators you may or may not use.

I use them on a 1 min setup.

Example will follow

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Here is a template with the bbmacd and 15 min HAMA on it.  As you can see the 15 min HAMA guides you on the 1 min charts.

The bbmacd is a good trend indicator although I don't use it.

Have fun, if you just look at the gif files 1 thru 11 it pretty much explains what I do with the indicators, and how I use them to facilitate my trading.

HH

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Forgot to mention folks, the last picture of the 1 min is a good example of compounding using the brokers money.

Very aggressive trading, but at the end of the 15 min run, you are finished for the day.

Practice makes perfect.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
In this eg looks like the opens are within 10 pips of each other, you have a range you look for?

cheers

--- 帖子 #98 ---
so much for not using many indicators... !!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
you are a little bit stressed perhaps..this is a open forum and many people looking for helps and are novice traders, sometimes can not react like your experiences..however I get understand your system and in two days I made many pips with this in testing..good thread

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I agree!

The beginning of the thread looked promising, but now I'm out of here...

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi HH,

I've a question about this chart. As you can see in my image, one could have taken a long in the point I marked. It would have lead to a loss..... Yes, I know it can happen....  but what I'd like to know is: have I made a correct observation? The price broke trendline, was above the Ma in color, HA smoothed was up, HA mtf was up, Stoch mtf was oversold and pointing up, Macd crossed up, and 3 ball, was surely present at that time.....

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
AZ can you kindly put the indicator and template on the chart above pls 1 question if you go long on that  were you put your stoploss?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
HH i just wana ask were you put your stoploss?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
HI SIR I'm trying to match your chart but im missing some indicator and my heiken_ashi smooth is not same as yours can you kindly pls post the indicator and template of your chart pls

--- 帖子 #105 ---
@AZ trader, all of my trades require a 3 ball below, if going long, and a 3ball above if going short, hope that answers your question

Hi HH one question Whats the setting you use in MTFstochastic and macd complete? thnx

--- 帖子 #112 ---
In this case it's allright, but you can't pretend when you see a chart that a repainting indi was really as you see it in hindsight....

As I said, in that chart the 3 ball is almost sure was there (instead of the 2).... then moved whan a new low is formed.....

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Macd complete are the standard ones i.e. 12,26,9

MTF Stoch must be set at least a TF higher of your trading one. E.G if you trade 1min stoch > 5min... Or, as HH said, if you trade 15min > stoch 1H and so on..

--- 帖子 #114 ---
aztrader is right.

That is a false signal.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
thnx AZ your right #3 repaint thats why we need to know where we place our stoploss?  until now i still dont know where we place the stoploss, need to have a lower stoploss and bigger gain to be succesful the only problem with this system Looks good when the market is trending, but in a ranging market you will get WHIPSAW

--- 帖子 #116 ---
hharrington,

Where did you get the skull and bones on your charts?

That looks familiar.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hello HH.  I appreciate the job you are doing on this thread -- Thank you.

Please take a look at your experts/log/compatibility file.  Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed_alert seems to log a continuous message in this file regardless of whether alerts are set to true or false.  This causes the log file to become very large and it slows down MT4.  I have not looked at the code because I do not use the alert function in HAS and have replace it with another HAS that does not support alerts.  Just a point of interest.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi HH

Regarding this stuff, what are the session open times you use (in GMT time)?

How near must be the lines (in pips) to be considered for the big move?

I think finding and trading pairs that hold trends for long periods of time is vital to this system; AU, AJ, A/CHF, EA, EJ, GJ? etc, and trading at the most active times are key.

I'm kind of familiar with most of these indies, yet how your using the HAMA and open lines are pretty clever. Having fun playing around with these.

Thanks for the system HH.

If you want to trade the 1 min time frame put on a mtf heiken 15 min and only trade the 1 min dips or rallies in the direction of the 15 min trend. As long as the 15 min heiken stays in the direction you are trading you can take all of the 1 and 2 ball trades if you wish.

The 15 min trends on several pairs of 100 pips or more, so they should provide adequate movement to capitalize on the 1 min or 5 min TF if you are so inclined to take those trades.

Again any of these methods require a lot of practice to become proficient with.

Bank those pips

@hharrington

Just wanted to say hello and thanks for sharing your method. Haven't followed it exactly perhaps, but a nice 30 pips following the reversal of HA smoothed, backed up with the 3 balls confirmation. Just these two indi's. (Disregard the bottom chart, which is a type of RSI). Keep up with the excellent thread. RS

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Thanks bro!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
You seem to be ignoring 30 min tf? Any specific reason for that?

If trading 30 min, would you suggest 60 min or 4 hr mtf indicators?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
@ indrek, I don't ignore any time frame, the 30 min tf is a very good choice, just adjust your mtf indicators accordingly. I trade the 1hr and 4 hr also.

This method works very well on any time frame. Find your self a really good trend line EA to enter trades with, draw a line along the bottom or top of HA candles, let the EA enter the trade for you.   Once the trade has developed

Draw another trend line along HA candles and let it exit for you. Hint: google magic stick

I use this method frequently on higher time frames from the 15 up

--- 帖子 #139 ---
KUDO's to you people getting positive pips

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Thanks, but my question was about mtf indicators - would you use 60 or 240 on m30 chart?

In your earlier post you said 15 goes with 60 and 60 with 240, so what is best for 30?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
@ indrek, I would suggest experimenting and use what works best for you.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
That is what I always do. Just wanted to hear your opinion

My experience is that timeframes that are too close to each other may not work in combination. Like 15/30 or 30/60. At the same time, 240 may be too far from 30.

I am sure that I am not the only person around who hates Heiken Ashi candles on charts. So, here is a link to an alternative indicator - Heiken Ashi Smoothed in Bars:

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Put some heiken ashi smoothed candles, 2,6,3,2 on a 15 min chart with a line chart nothing else and watch it for a few weeks, then tell me that you hate heiken ashi bars.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
sorry, meant to say hate heiken ashi candles

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I have watched them and I know what I am speaking about. I need to see ordinary candles clearly - if they open up or down and what is the shape and size. HA candles, even smoothed, mess the chart up. Cannot make my living if trading blindly.

Your system has very strong elements, so I am trying to combine them with my own setups.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
This is for your benefit Indrek I love the 1 min charts and fib levels are respected here also. I can look at heikens on the 5 min while trading the 1 min.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi hharrington

That looks realy fascinating to me. Is it possible to attach the template?

Thanks for all work you have done for us young traders.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thank you

I trade mostly 30 min and hourly, never 1 min. But a good system works on every timeframe, just needs some adjustments.

I very much like your idea of looking for trades after Semaphor 3 signal. I think many people try to use this indicator in absolutely wrong ways.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
How did you get your 5min mtf heiken behind your candles?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I notice that HAMA on the chart repaints so badly.....! more than HAMA below the chart.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Here is a picture of my trading rules, should answer all questions regarding indicators, stop loss positions, and compounding a trade for more pips.  This is a 5 min trade setup EUR/USD late friday afternoon.

Please, if you don't have indicators google them, that is how I have gotten most of my indicators.

I purchased Magic Stick because I could not find a free EA that works as well.

Quit complaining about re-painting indicators, this just shows your ignorance about indicators.

Regarding the hama, I agree the MTF heiken ashi indicator works better in the bottom window. I am always experimenting to find a better way,

My method is a very solid method for trading if you take the time to be able to visualize it.  Happy pippin, bank those pips.

Great thread! I have read over your system a few times. The first couple trades i did, trades didnt turn out to well. So i went back and read the posts a few more times and still had questions. I took a chart loaded it up went back a few months started back testing it. And then, i could semi see it. Made a few great trades and couple losses. I took a trade thursday night and turned out awesome 105pips. So i sat there and study it for a while and friday i did a few more and turned out pretty well. Still had a few questions but then I just seen your last post and that was the post that cleared just about everything up. So thank you very much. I still need to work on the small time frame it is harder to me then the larger tf. First time i have really looked at the 1min 5min(im more of the 1hr/4hr/d). Im sure with more chart time it will come. Thanks for sharing your system i WILL be adding this too my TBOT (tool box of trading) . Great posts and hope to see you updates in the future.

Thank you HH,

Hello HH.  Qurstion for you.  After 9+ years of trading, you must know the brokers pretty good.  Spread becomes more important on the lower timeframes, especially the 1m.  When you are looking to make 6 - 10 pips on a trade, a 2-3 pip spread becomes a killer.  My opinion, of course.  Who do you trade with when trading 1m live?  Do you use an ECN?  Hard to find a US based ECN, and good-old Dodd-Frank requires that we in the US use US brokers.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
For obvious reasons I can not recommend a broker, but I can tell you I have used PFG best if you trade stateside, and probably one of the only brokers today that will accept US accounts off shore FinFX in Finland.

@ eaglepip, a lot of good 1 min trades are passed up because people are waiting for other timeframes to agree.

Thanks for the point to IB.  I am pretty wired into MT4 at this point , however -- program MQL and use it extensively in my trading.  I do not see that IB has a MT4 platform.  Would like to find a good US-based ECN with small spread and commission OK.  IB almost fits the bill.

Had patience and didn't jump into a short because I didn't get the price and confirmation I needed, saw things lining up trying to go again. My blue heiken ashi smoothed was over the Orange MA, MA cross headed up, things looked good, So jus pulled the trigger instead of thinking too much about it.

Took around another 20 pips. Real happy with this method so far, +40 for the day already. Patience and some discipline. Please feel free to share any thoughts or advice hharrington

Good job wilteredfire, it just takes some practice and pretty soon you arent afraid to pull the trigger.  I use a mtf stochastics in the bottom window also,  set to the next highest TF, this is my early warning of a reversal.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
If y'all will check post 153 it has the trading rules in the picture.

Add the bbmacd which I posted here by opening the navigator, and dragging the indicator into the bottom window with the other indicators.   Set the StDv to .55 and you are in business...

Only trade the 1 min in the direction of the 5 min mtf indicators in the bottom window,,safe trades.

A 15 min setup Study the chart picture. Lots of good info. The short trade took off from the 5 pm open last night. The long trade was a result of the NY guys running it back up again.

Notice how they ran it down from the NY open. This is a trap move to get retail traders thinking short, then they set the Low of the day and up we went.

Pay attention to the Daily Open lines they give you all kinds of info about the market.

I have read a lot of traders threads since I started trading forex. If you are going to take the time to get into a trade, (it requires a lot of effort with the knowledge you have gained to take a trade) why would you settle for 5 or 10 pips.

I feel once you have triggered a trade , provided you have done your studies, stay the course until the trade has finished.  I used to jump out with 5 or 10 pis and then watch it continue for another 20 or 30. Not anymore, the 1 min swings for 30 or 40 pips, and I get all I can per trade. If you stay in trades until they reverse, you No. 1 have large Reward to Risk, No 2. dont have to take so many trades even on the 1 min TF.

Most of the stuff people say about asia trading session is untrue.  I make as many pips in Asia as any other session if I choose to trade it.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
As I was writing this I am in an AU 1 min trade short, presently + 38 pips and still going.  This is on the 1 min time frame folks, during asia, about 7:56 pm EST using this setup.

I have been trading forex profitably for several years.  You introduced a new element to my trading through this thread.  I normally wait for a trend to develop on the longer time frames and then wait for the pullback and enter my position using the shorter time frames.  Your system has allowed me to take advantage of the beginning of the direction change by following the 1 minute chart first and then letting the trade run if the longer time frames follow suit.  I can't believe I hadn't thought of this before.  Thank you so much for starting this thread.

hello hharrington

this is great but can i trade on 1 m but i see first on 15 m direction.

Thank you JTB for understanding the concept. If you put a 1 min shi channel, and a 5 min, and a 15, and a 30 etc etc. and watch the progression all the way up to the daily, its like the hands on a clock, the 5 follows the 1, the 15 follows the 5, etc etc.

I just knew that eventually some successful  trader would look at this thread and see the advantages of starting low and working to higher time frames.

Personally, Xcode, I trade the 1 min when my 5 min mtf indicators agree.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
If the 1 min is in a sideways market and only moving 10 to 15 pips in a channel why would you even bother.  Well you can bank 5 pips on every trade from top to bottom of the channel.  This is a job to me....if I can bank 5 pips per trade and have 10 successful trades, I am going to take every trade. Add 50 pips in the bank.

On the 1 min charts if you don't take all the trades you miss the ones that run for 30 or 40 pips.

If the channel is only 7 or 8 pips wide then I leave it alone.

when m5 in trend up ( the second bar for blue) and m1 have already half run the trend up, am i have to wait for 3 ball in the bottom and heiken change red into blue ( the next trade because some time m1 already half run trend and suddenly it turn down #3 ball appear in the bottom# before it up again)

sometimes we see heiken smoothed turning into blue when heiken ashi still continue turn down. until heiken smoothed turn back into red so its time to to see m1 setup, is it ok hharrington ?

Hello HH

I have been trading Forex for sometime now (having looked at many trading strategies out there). To me your thread here has really been the most beneficial & has shown me the correct approach to trading. You are right in saying that your live trading is not the issue here. I implement the strategy, play around with it on a demo account & find out myself if it will work for me or not when I trade live. Lets not get hooked on live trading results. One person's trading results (using the same strategy) will or can be totally different to some one else's trading performance for various reasons.

It does not matter what method or "system" you choose to trade, the important part is to find something that you have confidence in that shows you the trend, and then a method to take some entries in that direction.

I like something simple to point out the trend for me whatever time frame I am trading. HA candles do that better for me than anything I have used in 10 years.

nice shorting opportunity...I think that I will stick with trading with the trend with this method...using the mtf 50 ema plotted on current time frame from next time frame up to keep me in line with the trend...

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Thanks P! Made the small but interesting change, kept my red 8ma and took my white price line off to focus more on the angle and stuff of the 8ma to see how sharp or smooth the price seems to be so I can get a better safer entry and less chop.

Heres a screenshot of it with the bb macd to harrington's experimental settings of 144,233,20 with the 0.55 deviation.

Looking forward to taking some good trades this week =)

Hi WiteredFire;

Can you share your new template ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I gotta say that this method should really work based on the basic idea behind this strategy and it does indeed seem pretty solid...I spent all day Sunday actually running some trades through the trade simulator to see what the semaphors and everything look like in real time and with the valid confirmation from the higher time frames it is indeed good to go...I've heard it and read it everywhere that reading and lagging indicators together makes a really good strong system if traded correctly and this shows just that...similar to Dredding's ideas....both being pretty simple concepts and such...but anyway...I have my own method I trade with pretty good success but was looking for something to maybe supplement the times where I don't have anything going on and this could be that...will continue forward testing and see how it goes....wilteredfire...you are a pretty good trader bro from what I've seen and from what I remember in chatting with you on skype so I'm sure it will be a good week for you...by the way that last screen shot has met an exit point in which one could have closed with a couple pips short of 1:2 R:R....

--- 帖子 #252 ---
second vertical line is where I would have exited this personally...hharrington may have different thoughts...

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Nice trade.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
hey buddy, ive posted the most recent one just on one of the previous few pages

Just set your line graph to none, make sure the orange ma is set to 50. The bb macd like I said is just set to 144, 233, 20. Enjoy bro =)

You can also use it to exit trades with.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
First post on the thread.

I like the concept of moving from lower to higher TF's. Makes good sense. Many time I'v waited for a trend and entered, only to find it reversed from my point of entry, bad entry I guess. But working the other way around is another world of possibilities. Will explore the idea and let know.

Just a word here to HH : Buddy, please be more considerate in your response. If someone asks you something you are not comfortable with, just mellow your tone a bit. Maybe the guy is asking such as he's seen many like you come and go and heaving him in a lurch with more doubt than he was ever before. Or maybe he's just a new bee and doesn't know better. Just a polite word from a fellow boarder, nothing else.

Thanks for showing us some positive light on this possible alternate scenario.

Regsrds, M.

Ya, I see. Pardon my silly observation. None the less, it's better to specify the pair and tf. The chart is big enough to see the picture but to figure the pair, one has to zoom in. Not an issue at all, still better to label it. Thanks.

@ McNish,

I am not going to answer questions regarding, Mt4 setup,or previously presented material in the thread.

My name is HH not "buddy", and if you would like to post in the thread do not run all of your sentences together in 1 paragraph.

I respect anyone who uses a little thought in what they are saying, and especially those people who entertain intelligent questions about trading.

Just the way it is "BUDDY"

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Great trading truchtzero,,anytime you are in postive pips its great trading lol.

I submit, that anyone (with a little practice) can draw a few trend lines on a chart, and make some positive trades.

It just takes practice, and not unlike me, some people have to practice more than others.

Thanks for sharing your method. I don´t have a real account, Just demo. I don´t read all the thread but I think I´m understanding. Never saw HA smoothed before. Great tool. I´ll be around.

By the way, your teaching method is called Didactic Transposition(my translation)  from the french math teacher, Guy Brousseau. It is based on giving the student the tools for him to build knowledge. You are teaching so hope you like to know this.

Sorry for my english.

I am trying to understand this system. I understand it on winning moves.

But how do you exit a loosing trade ?

This GU setup should not have worked right ?

The BB MACD turned on you from Blue to Orange.

Did you exit the trade here and take the small loss ?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
do people have problems using this system in choppy markets ?

obviously works when it trends but I find it difficult to stay in a trade when the market just goes up and down and in no direction.

Can this be avoided ?

Many thanks

p.s. this is in reference to the GU market right now which is so choppy

--- 帖子 #287 ---
This is actual screenshot.

Trad is still active. I am waiting for up move. SL is below 3semaphore and is not reached by price yet.

Dont worry about BB , it is blue again. Most important for direction are MTF indicators.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
you cant just trade on m1 you must look on m5 or m15 for trend direction

--- 帖子 #293 ---
This is interesting. You're saying you must look at m5 or m15 for deciding to enter into a m1 trade.

Two points:

1. Is it not the opposite of what HH was telling in the beginning? post #16

2. Don't you already have this information in the lower indi panel, e.g. from the MTF-HA?

HH, which is your opinion on the above?

Bye

TH

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Another question:

in the early posts (e.g. post #32), HH showed to trade just in the direction of the "slow" MA (34 or 50 for TF > H1).

Recently I see that:

* this indicator was not cited in the OO rules

* HH: you're no longer using it: post #257

* Other successful traders here like truchtzero are not even painting it anymore on their chart.

I think it is a good idea skipping it, actually, because I have the impression several times this slow MA let you in at the end of the swing, on short TF, i.e. where the next reversal is just waiting for you to be eaten off.

Bye

TH

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi,

I would also like to remind that, in spite of the fact of the semafor being probably a very good "leading indicator" for real time trading, it is absolutely important NOT to use it for looking back at past trades. It would surely give a wonderful impression of majestic trades, because you'll see the 3 ball in the past just at the place it decided to settle, after having moved several times. (Note that I am NOT using the word "repainting!!!!").

Fortunately, looking around, I found the attached indicator, which leaves a "trace" of all the positions where, during "history", the 3 ball appeared. From the pick, you might see that this behavior of the 3 ball "real time" would have prevented some otherwise very nice trade (because, at the time of entry, it would have been just ABOVE the entry signal). Sometimes it happens that "real time" the ball gives some bad signals...

Just FYI.

Bye

TH

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi!

Could someone give me a link to a site that explains how the Semafor works?

Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #297 ---

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks for the info, and you are correct, the trade pictures do not represent what actually happens in real time.

But since this is about trading Heiken Ashi candles, and everyone knows semafors repaint, and move up or down with the trend when it changes, why don't you do as i suggested in the thread and put some HA candles on a line chart and watch for a while.

Nobody suggested trading 3 balls, only trade when direction has been established

In your illustration if you had stayed in the trade in the direction of the heiken ashi candles you would have booked a lot of pips.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi HH,

thank you very much for your reply, but sorry, very respectfully: I wouldn't have been into that trade, because the BB was red up to that point, and the rules would have kept me out.

As soon as the BB became blue, a 3 ball would have popped up above the price line. I know we are not trading the 3ball "per se".

Bye

This is just basically trade what BB MACD tells you to + Semaphores (I know they repaint) and then apply some theory on trend higher TF.

Closed the order, banked 9 Pip.

Why exit?

even though the Trend on M5 is still and clearly going north, the M1 didn't.

Every single indicator iam using in the template confirmed that the trend is weakening. Iam only interested in fast trades with fast pips so banked 9 pips.

Thanks for your efforts. looking forward to the new one. EVEN easier. My idiot brain is overjoyed . I like simple.

Hi HH.

I find your system very interesting.

My basic system is Tricolour developed by Paulus (M1). But lately i looked for longer TF system (m15, H1,H4). Once i found Freebie by Dred. But i cant say i have succes trading this system.

Some day i have found your system and i think it is very close to my personality. Now i am jumping from one TF to another looking for entry signal. I think i have to make decision to trade max two TF's lets say M5 or M15 for short term and H4 for long term trading.

Would you like to comment my trades posted on thid thread , please?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
The 5 pm open

--- 帖子 #319 ---
A currency usually moves in a 40 to 50 pips sideways channel until it decides to move for a few hundred pips up or down.

You can scalp the channel when you recognize them.

A higher percentage of time when the price leaves the open right away, it usually returns to the open from that range before a direction is established.

I always look for the trades back to the open before a daily direction has been established.   A nice easy 30 or 40 pips in both directions.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Back to the open ?????

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Fun stuff don't you think, almost there.

Seems like it.

There is a press conference scheduled in a few minutes from now.

Ahhh, sorry, you were talking about the AU, I am ONLY focussed on the EU, which was getting back to pivot.

Looking forward to your new setup, have not even gotten to load any of the earlier material, anyhow, trading my own material but intrigued about what you do.

As long as the pips get booked.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
This is the chart setup I am presently using.  I will post the indicators later.

I think all you need is the FIFO.  It replaces the mtf ha

I don't need to tell y'all everything is blue for Longs do I ?????

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Is your entry to early?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
No where in any of my ramblings on will you see wait until the close of a candle.

You enter the trade when the indicators tell you too, and the candle is long or short...

--- 帖子 #330 ---
If you are going to trade the 1 min time frame, you cannot wait for the close of the candle,,,when price crosses the line it is an entry if the indicators line up, not when a candle closes.

Sometimes on the 1 min if you wait for a candle close the trade is over.

On trade backs to the open, in particular, all you are waiting for is the the next time frame up stoch to roll over.

I will post an example

--- 帖子 #331 ---
OK. But i still dont understand why you entered on this candle?

I need to watch it on my own chart.

Is it a carrency chart or stock index?

So can you post settings of FIFO indicator?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Maybe I have not been clear on this.

Let me go over the rules again for the 1  min,,,I trade when price crosses a line...pick a moving average, I like the 5 or the 8 EMA  (pick one that you like)

When price crosses that line I enter, then use all the other indicators on the chart to stick with the trade until it ends, or takes me out with a trailing stop, or Break even stop, or it reaches my target.

Hope this relieves some of the doubt. I will post a few examples so you understand what I am saying

The first chart is step 1 of the process.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks for the explanation. This means you do not wait for a pullback on the M1, do you?

And on the M5, M15 and higher you always enter on pullback AND candle close?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Step 2 1 min trade entries

--- 帖子 #335 ---
You are like most people learning to trade, you have not learned the nuances of trading the shorter time frames.

It takes loads of screen time and practice, which I think I mentioned in the first part of this thread.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
3rd and final step of 1 min trade example.

3 trades 10 pips each equals 30 pips, or you could have just stayed in, and moved your stop up.  ( your choice)

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Final step

The only way you can learn to do this folks is to spend some time at the screen, and practice practice practice,,then it becomes second nature to enter the trades.

Have fun and bank them pips

HH

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Practice Practice, and more Practice.

Both of these trades lasted about 12 minutes each, so don't use the excuse that the 1 min is too fast.

You have to pay attention, but it produces lots of pips if you learn how to trade it in both directions.

Don't always be in a rush to get out of a trade let it run if its still going in your direction

This is all happening live folks,,i love it when the 1 min swings like this

--- 帖子 #339 ---
EU, 1min, 30 pips.

HH thanks for additional charts, very helpful. Actually, as you have mentioned, you could use any combination of indicators, HAs, MAs etc to make this work. Cheers.

Final thought of the day.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
If you take a close look at the last chart i posted, you will see that I am trading the pullbacks.

TAKE A REALLY CLOSE LOOK

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Find a pair that is trending well and marry it

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Can you clarify?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I use 1 balls and 2 balls for entries when the indicators in the bottom window are still pointed in the long direction.

From years of practice on the 1 min charts.  No draw down, instantly into profit.

The 1 balls and 2 balls and 3 balls are points of support and resistance.  If you look at fundamental trading of support and resistance, then that is all we are doing.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I relabeled this chart for you Olarion Read what the candles are telling you lol

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I am not doubting in your experience and knowledge HH.

I just really want to understand what you are writing on forum.

This is how i understand entries on M1.

So, when trend is changing we are looking for first entry (price must cross EMA). And when trend developed in right direction we are looking for reentrance or adding lots (we enter after 1,2 semaphore).

Am i right?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
next question

--- 帖子 #351 ---
The red scull & crossbones is not TRO's, It is mine!....his is a tiny gray scull & crossbones....

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Who cares, would you like me to take it off the charts.  Where did you first see it.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
When I talk about a 1 min movement it is on my charts, and if you have a different broker,,especially in MT4 your charts could differ by mine for several pips.

It is a fundmental process that I am trying to present (by the way its free) Believe it or not believe, thats up to you but quit picking my charts apart.

So grow up

--- 帖子 #354 ---
For me, the indicators help confirm the trend, the semaphor helps confirm entry, S&R/pivot for exit.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Please when are you posting the new template sir?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
HH. English is not my first language so maybe thats why   you completly  didnt understand my question. It is not matter of different broker. The  matter is that we can say that MTF stoch M5 is changing direction only  if M5 candle is closed.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Some people would lead you to believe they created a method to trade.

I am not one of them, I took information that I gathered from the internet, ( like most of the people in FF learned how to trade) and found bits and pieces of what worked for me, and I trade it successfully.

Anyone can do this, because the information posted in FF is free.

So for the naysayers that wander into this room, read the info presented here, take it or leave it, if you leave negative comments you will be put on Ignore.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
You can say whatever you want, candles don't have to be closed for the stochastics to be oversold or overbought.

Where is it cast in stone that a candle has to be closed for an indicator to work???? (narrow minded)

Any more comments from you Iwan and you will be put on ignore...go back to dreds room where you came from

I can see that you need some lessons on fundamental trading Iwan, does 1,2,3, or, A,B,C ring a bell

I love trading fib setups

--- 帖子 #366 ---
1 min fib trade follow up. The fib levels give you ideas of how strong or weak a move is.

If the 382 pull back holds it is a weak move down, if it gets violated it is a strong move to probably the 618, or farther.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I booked 14 pips because the bottom window indicators changed, if you had the balls to trade the T2, it would have provided 19 pips.

Ok this is for all of you wannabe 1 min chart traders.

All you need on your charts are some HA's zig zag, pick a moving average you like for a cross, a longer term MA for direction if you prefer, and in the lower window, the Macd Complete and the mtf stochastics, set at 5 min.

I, personally use a swing fib on all my charts, but thats up to you.

Have fun HH

Hi hh

Thanks for sharing your system.

Many thanks

Hi hharrington,

thanks for the template. I saw you changed the mtf stoch settings to 5,3,3 (from 9,3,3) and also the Zig Zag settings to 6,5,3 instead of 12,5,3.

Do you find them more reliable?

Yes on the 1 min charts the settings work best for me, 5 min and up I use the old settings.

Great work!

I found your thread few days ago. Started to trade yesterday with great success. Reading second time and still learning.

Thanks

Dear HH

where can i find your final indicator and template?

if you want to post it , please post it completely in one post(indicator + template)

tnxx

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Look through the thread.  There is a zip file a while back.  After that, you will need to download them as they appear.  You will find it all as you read through the thread  :-)

--- 帖子 #394 ---
ok tnx

but i need to read 27 page and about 400 post, OR dear HH need to just copy indicator and final template here or post 1

anyway tnx again

--- 帖子 #395 ---
If you don't read the thread, you will not know how he uses the indicators.

This is how so many 'traders' fail - they just want a template and don't bother putting in the time to really learn and become familiar.  imho

Guys, if you are trading M15, in what time timeframe do you set your MTF Indicators ? M30, H1, H4?

TKS

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I like to follow the 1 hr around on the 15 min. So I set to 1 hr.

There is nothing free, you have to put the time in, or you will never become a trader. If you want someone to call trades for you join a paid trade room.

Hi hh

Bagging pips consistently.......thanks for sharing again. Picking 5 pip runs starting to be fairly easy.......of course some times we get lucky and those short runs turn into long runs.

For those who are still trying to understand when to enter etc re-read those charts where with explanations, they really helped me.

Good pips for all.

Fantastic Ezzy, your welcome

The best way to describe my trading style, I am a swing trader on any timeframe.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi,

nice chart.

This M1 chart looks a little different than your last template...have you added/changed some parts (e.g. moving averages)?

Does it mean you trade also the pullbacks of the price action (1 MA) and/or HA candles and not only the cross of the price action and the 8 EMA?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I have mentioned in past post's, pick some moving averages that you like for trading and add them to your template, I frequently use price crossing the 8 ema for entries. My style of trading usually trades a pullback but not necessarily when the 1 min is swinging nicely.

It all takes practice

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Here is an indicator you may like, it keeps you informed of all the important possible support and resistance levels on all timeframes.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Here is a daily open line indicator, (vertical lines) with labels. Use this along with the daily open line if you wish.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
just start to demo and some tests. got stopped on AUD/USD 15M today...

HH, did i miss some point? or that's it?

USD/CAD hit SL too...

--- 帖子 #409 ---
If you want me to critique your trade entries, you have to mark where you got in and what time it was EST. I trade eastern standard time.

Otherwise I have no idea what you are talking about

If you will practice with nothing on your charts but the line chart and heiken ashi candles (15 min chart) you will see the swings.  Add a semafor to the charts, and when you want to go long, put the stop loss below the 3 ball, and short put the stop loss above the 3 ball.

Watch for a few weeks until you get the gist of seeing swings.

HH

--- 帖子 #410 ---
The cad and I don't agree, I never trade the us/cad. I only trade pairs that have a daily average over 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
For the purpose of everyone being on the same page, download the mt4 demo platform from PFG best.

Then when you describe a trade I can look at it on my demo platform and give you an intelligent response, without having to calculate what time it is on your charts.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I was really punished today. I think I applied all the theory correctly.

On the chart, I had several long positions as indicators was also supported by this bullish impulse move we had early from the Europe session.

All my longs died.

So I decided market was heading down and then i tried the same principles and tried to short the US market ... except it got Bullish.http://content.screencast.com/users/...02-23_2334.png

Punishing day

--- 帖子 #413 ---
HH, Im watching the swings and take notes about possible trades... I just start demo today.

Ok about the CAD.

But A/U seems to be right... Smooth ha changed red, mtf stoch OB and pointed down, macd complete cross down, 3 semaphor above... I waited for a pullback and the dots to made H,L,LH and took the trade when price crossed the moving average.

There is a small red arrow pointed the place I made the trade and a blue vertical line where i got stopped. The entry time was 07:15 ( EASTERN TIME ).

--- 帖子 #414 ---
detail: I put SL above the 1 semaphor dot ( last swing high )

--- 帖子 #415 ---
it is my loosing trade. Did i sth wrong entry this trade at that moment?

Price bounced from tokyo, sydney open and went up.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
without knowing where price is going then trading in the wrong direction means you will hit SL. Thats not the problem however because its ok to loose. However the problem is where market is going sideways these trades tends to hit my SL.

Problem is that market is bipolar ... 50% of time it is trending and 50% its going sideways.

So I estimate you got a 25% chance of winning.

Why ?

Well because sideways you loose and in the trending market lets say you get 50% of the calls right and 50% you might be going the wrong direction. If you think that is an exaggeration then remember the Trend can change at any time !

So overall this = 25%. Its a pretty crude model but it does show why trading is really difficult and odds are against us. Market is not binary it does not just go up or down.

So I think its necessary to apply some leading indicators to the high level chart. So if you are trading 5M then you need to draw some SR lines on the 15M and enter the market according to the setup on the 15M and use this system as the trigger on the 5M.

What do you think ?

Ok ... or how else can I elimanate a Sideways market and how better can I determine the direction of the market (MA are not good enough)

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Why dont you use the MACD BB lines aswel ?

Did you see the 3 above you when you entered into your trade ?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Yes, when i enter trade 3 ball was where ball 2 is on the screen.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
ok in which case your SL should have been above the 2.

therefore you should not have lost so many pips.

But end of the day ... if market is moving one way and you are going the other even if thats what these indicators are saying then you are going to loose.

Not sure how to fix that problem ... not sure its fixable. But you can limit your losses by placing a better SL.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
In the matter of SL you are right.

When trading day is begining we never know if first move is only introduction of big move or just swing. I try to catch swings like HH show us on last 2 pages of this thread. Thats why i entered short when price crossed MA, and stoch down.

By the way, if i had BB MACD on my screen i would not be allowed to enter trade.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
lets see, all indicators are go, the setup chart is on the 1hr as you can see huge bearish move and trigger is placed on the 15 min all indicators just got bearish from the pull back.

The setup chart is from Hector DeVille. and I am using this scalping strategy as the trigger.

http://content.screencast.com/users/...02-24_1148.png

1) Update on this trade looks like its going to be a loosing trade no new lows were created and now its bouncing back up attacking my SL placed behind the 3

Come over from Dredds thread. I like this system......

Entry on red line. Think I am doing something right. Hardest part is filtering out the chop.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
not sure if you are doing it right unless prior to this move you was stopped out on a long and short entry ?

And i dont see any evidence to suggest that you are trading with the trend and how you determined what the trend was.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
He has HA of 4 timeframes on his chart, so we may say that he is trading very much with the trend. Very solid setup.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
This 'Trend' thing can be hard work to suss out at first. But here is my take on it...

I think if we are trading the 1min swings you shouldnt look any further higher than the 5m TF. After all we are trying to take a small part of the swing on the 5m chart whilst ignoring tops n bottoms.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

D

P.S The 4HA MTF is a smoothed version. Not sure if I am keeping it on my charts yet.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hello all, i finished reading the thread today and let me tell you, i like it, but what i like the most it's the psicological approach that HH is preaching here, there is really no need to complicate things, just pull the trigger at the right time and the right price, even with just 1 indicator we can be very profitable, HH i have a system of my own which i use on 1H and 4H, what you gave me here with your system is a hell of a trigger for my system which i have been testing this past two days and let me tell you it seems this is a gold mine, i have attached a chart where i marked the entry of my system on H1 and then go down to the 5M to pull the trigger with yours... (a little tweaked and some other indis i use), if its ok with you i can share my knowledge on your thread because in the end this is for helping each other right?, anyway i do not wat to confuse the readers with another stuff, so i will post my chart as i am using it right now...i had signals with my system and as soon as i got them i went with yours on the 5M chart to pin point my entry, here they are

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Rossobonks,

Can you post your 4HA MTF indicator?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
It is fine to trade the 1 min in a sideways market, the key is the 1 min channel has to be wide enough to make some pips with.

It is awfully difficult to get 5 or more pips if the channel is only 8 pips wide and the spread is 3 or 4 pips lol

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Glad to have you aboard robby2007.

Share away, I learned how to trade by other people sharing their little tricks and secrets.  Please if you want to trade 1 hr, watch the daily open lines that I have mentioned previously.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
you got it rossobanks. Any mtf indicator you can use to determine 5 min direction is good for the 1 min. As you move up time frames, you move your mtf indicator with them.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Finally what I had hoped for,  interesting conversations about trading a method.  I don't care what system you use for trading, it is a concept that I am teaching. Trading is a very visual thing, If you can recognize certain patterns that happen over and over again, soon it becomes easy to take trades from those patterns.

With MTF indicators to guide you, it even gets easier.

@ Robby2007, I was in the EUR trade also

--- 帖子 #432 ---
@ Joao

I have been trading less than a year so I am by no means an expert here among this crowd of fantastic traders. Since I discovered the semafors I have been a fan and have been following any thread that may help me improve on using them.  Having said that, I used to get faked out a lot with the semafors, especially in a very strong trend movement like yesterday.

Now I use the ArrZZx2 with the semafor.  I only get in the trade if an area of support or resistance is formed with the semafor.  The ArrZZx2 also forms a little blue "x" to warn you to get out if direction is unsure. As I only trade the 5 min and the 1 min this is important to me so I can get out and then jump back in when the trend continues. This has worked for me. I hope it helps you.

I will try to upload here but if it doesnt work, I may need instructions.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
You should post that in red capital letters in the first post.

Some people just DO NOT have what it takes to become a trader; not everybody will make it to become a surgeon.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Find a mtf trend indicator, geez i just happen to have one.  Put it on your chart and set it to the next time frame up. Pick a number that you like,,7 9, 20 21 etc, use it as your line in the sand. If you are above it trade long, below it trade short.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
For the newbies here is an example of how to use the T3 clean.  If you use it you don't need the mtf heiken ashi in bottom window.

HH

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Thanks HH, i will be trying to contribute, i do have your open lines in mind, i just don't plot it on my charts as i like to have them as clean as possible  the EURUSD shot up beautifully...

I aslo wanted to mention that i like to hold my trades as much as possible, catch between 20 and 100 - 150 pips, (1H - 4H swings) since i can't spend too much time to be on the screen, so i'll share my swing system later on when i finish testing up the entries and TPs  on the 5M...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Fantastic

--- 帖子 #438 ---
forgot to post settings for ArrZZ:

SR- 3

SRZZ- 30

MainRZZ - 50

Again...I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Xstorm, I like your chart and the way you are using HHs method. If its ok with HH could you share your template.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
As long as we don"t get away from heiken ashi candles, that is what this thread is basically about. If someone wants a template pm each other.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Thanks HH. I tried not to ask Xstorm for his template on this thread, but his PM is not functional yet

By the way, I forgot to mention that I'm really impressed with you sharing your methods and teaching.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Folks, I welcome ideas about trading.  But lets keep this thread focused on support and resistance, Price action trading with trend lines, and using HA for trend on any time frame.  Have fun

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hello guys this is my thinking at the moment, new week, good luck to all, here my 4H outlook on the EURUSD, and the 5M entry, a little risky because the strong up move but since we don't have a cristal ball, we have to find enoygh reason to pull the trigger

--- 帖子 #444 ---
GBPUSD short also...

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Regarding my template: Nothing really special about it. I use semaphors, trendlines, Heiken Ashi MA T3 new, MML and of course the arrzz. Probably what you are seeing that stands out is the auto fib zones, which colors in the daily high and low zones where price is most likely to reverse. The Bobokus does the same except that it the typical fibo tool that seems adjust to the last high and low. The auto fib zone only adjust to the average range for whatever TF that you are using.

Please be aware that in a strongly trending market, it will expand or adjust to include the new price range. If you are an aggressive trader (early entry) this may not be the tool for you. But if you follow HH trading style of lower high or higher low entries, they both work!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I was Stopped out on my GBPCHF move. So far no winners.

I think its easy to show a trending market and show how the system collects the pips ... but frankly speaking what MA system does not work when the market is trending ?

Problem is that market 50% is not trending.

Next time you want to post a trade ... post it while its live dont just cherry pick.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
1 min is one of the time frames preferred by traders but it does not help in all trading strategies.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
i thought this pervert was banned

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hello Dr. Lobo, if you had no winners yet it is because you have not got the system yet, you have to practice it for a while, i have made 5 trades since i started reading this thread and all those 5 are closed positive, you will not find any system that works under both conditions, trending and ranging, that is why you have to lear how to identify a trend and how to identify a range, and only then you can trade succesfully with any, and i mean any system, today i told you guys when the market opened what i was expecting to happen, and i post my trades the moment i triggered them, and both of them are now closed +50 and +20, so you can't tell me i haven't posted them live, learn how to trade my friend and any indicator system will work like a charm, Support, resistance, fibs, trendlines, etc know what the market is doing and you will be very succesful with any indicator you choose, i don't mean to be rude, but if you are expecting to just use this system without all the necessary knowledge that come behind in trading, better go find some commercial signal service and do as they tell you..., if you really want to learn stick here for a while and things will get better eventually, cheers my friend...

It certainly helps if you are in a 1 min trade and the market decides to turn at that point.  What is your point Henryduncan? If you have a point. We talk about all time frames here.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
When I first started trading, I analyzed the daily and 4hr and made entries on the 5min. (I was fortunate to have a mentor to help me grasp FX concepts rather fast.) I quickly discovered, that I did not have the nerves it takes to be a swing trader, or the patience to wait for 4hr or daily setups BUT they were some of the best trades I'd ever taken!

My trading philosophy has transitioned to "each time frame tells its own truth". It is absolutely fantastic to see HH's bottom up system and your top down analysis working together!

Kudos on the great call on the eur/usd yesterday! I followed your trade yesterday....

fair enough dont really want to become a troll I wish you all good luck ... I actually like the indicators but taking blind trades will not work over time so i am trying a way to mix this scalping strategy with leading indicators such as TL or harmonics.

If I come up with something interesting I will share.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
XStorm you could post the tpl file for your graphics?

He already did some posts ago, don't be lazy guys

Here you go. Same system just different indicators.  Blue template is for TF 30m and above. Green is good for 1, 5, 15 min. You have to choose your own oscillators.... I use the ones HH has provided.

Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #459 ---
The 5 sing ZZ 2 has an top/bottom alert that cannot be switched off. But I keep it because it only shows up when a major swing is about to occur. But please keep in mind that it is still a dynamic indicator and WILL adjust to price action.  So you must follow HH's system on trading semaphors and HA to avoid the fakeouts as much as possible!

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Well, it is not that i have a crystal ball, everything happened exactly as i predicted 15 Hours ago, i have banked +70 pips on the sell and now i am ready to buy, i hope this buy gets me at least 100+ or i might be adding to my first position as it develops

--- 帖子 #461 ---
DrLobo, i didn't meant to be rude but in order to become a succesful trader you must know how to look at naked charts, and you must be able to read and try to predict what is going to happen (tecnically speaking), when there are not strong fundamentals on a given currency pair it will move tecnically, so you have to pay attention to S/R (trendlines, Fib retracements, horizontal S/R, round numbers, open lines) you can't trust any indicator system at all if you don't have this stuff in mind first... as i said befor i will share my method later on so you guys can take advantage of it... so don't go away Lobo, stay on the boat we will succeed

EDIT: Bought EURUSD at 1.34027 wish me luck!

Scalping the M1 and then also multiple pairs.

Gee, somebody is asking for a MC along this road.

Trust me, people, get to know your favorite pair like you got to know your spouse and then it is VERY rewarding to trade that pair.

It is typical brainwashing that has occured from the criminals that want you to trade as much as you can.

Going for 2%/d represents a nice living here in Mexico.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Freddy, i personally do not trade the 1M, i trade 4H swings and pinpoint my entry and re entries on the 5M chart, so it is not too hard to focus on 2-4 pairs, i ususally just trade 2...and by the way i know them better than my wife , until they change they behaviour (like my wife) then i don't know them at all jajajajajaja

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Freddy I agree with you about being married to your pairs.  I am married to a currency, the aussie. I normally only trade the au, ga, ea or sometimes the aj. Today, I cheat with the EU and the Aud/Usd moves over 130 pips since the NY open...

but...what can I say: you cant complain when you gain!

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Absolutley Freddy, my goal is 3% daily

--- 帖子 #470 ---
The Aussie has been 1 of my favorite pairs for the last few years. I think I have mentioned this before, find a pair that is trending well and marry it.

A good trend

Look how this lines works like clock until broke, a little update on my EU trade, hope it breaks to the upside

Since i am currently looking only to go long look at how many opportunities for scalpers, or imagine adding up on every buy signal, you only need a 20 pip move to make 60 or so...just dreaming...

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Yes all low risk entries on the pullbacks to the bottom line going long. The question is would you risk 5 pips to make 20. Should be an easy answer.

Ok let's do something, since we have reasons to enter a trade, we need reasons to get out of it, a simple trendline will do the job, if that 5M beautiful trendline gets broken to the downside i am out..., if not i'm still in... anyone agree?

Do exactly what your rules tell you to do. Your longer term success depends on risk-reward ratio, not the result of one trade, so your stop loss, trailing and take profit policy should be decided before taking any trades not during a trade.

EDIT: Besides, when trading hourly charts I would suggest smart trailing. At lower timeframes, fixed target gives best results. NB! Meaning longer term result (= at least one month).

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Iam really starting to like these 1m setups.....

D

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Robby...interesting...

I normally stay in the trade until failure off of a major support or resistance area which signals to me that either trend is changing or deep retracement. But trend lines are cool too.

This Mt Trendline is automatic if you like that type of exit strategy, however you may have to disable the fractals and semafors to get just the trendline.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
@ Rosso

Two good swings on the EU 1 min since NY open.  Hope you had fun!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Seems some here like this swing trading on the M1.

To answer a few PMs at the same time, I scalp the M1.

That is a different approach to managing this TF.

It also includes a different chart setup.

YES, the M1 can turn on the flip of a coin, so taking swings and try to get out as much as there is, is NOT my approach.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I am one for swingin' if that is what the market is giving me.  When I am in the market, I am a tick on an elephants back.  I take the ride until it is no longer safe! And when the elephant relaxes, I jump back on again.  I think that this strategy allows scalping, range trading, trend trading.

But you are right Freddy, you not only have to have the right strategy, you have to have the right chart set up for the trading style of your choice.  Scalping is a high adrenaline sport! Fast past but high rewards with great timing. ....gotta' be fit for that type of trading!

This is eclectic trading at its best. IMHO

Hi, i will share it in time, since the system i use it's different than the one we are trying to teach here i don't want to confuse the readers...

Well the EU its in negative territory -15, while the GU it's positive +70, i still think overall trend is UP so this retracements are perfectly normal, let's see what is the FOMC later on gives us...

Although I like your work here very much, I have developed over the years my own Mayan Scalper.

I stick to the following rules:

1. ONLY trade EU

2. ONLY trade M1

3. ONLY scalp

4. Preferably London & NY session

5. Compound

6. ONLY focus on entry, rest is automated

7. Strive for 2%/d equity improvement

I figured out in time that the brokers are our enemies. They have people in the forums that pretend all sorts of rubbish, while the real way to trade is SOOO easy.

Simply check how they make the grass looks greener on the other side in their ads everywhere.

Becoming profitable in forex has not much to do with the indicators, it has to do with getting educated, like we learned how to walk, ride a bike, drive a car.

As long as a person is unable to reach the level of subconscious trading behavior, he (or she) will not easily make it in trading.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
So guys, I am still a newbie (by your terms) so I wanted to post something here for the newbies who may get a little frustrated in these forums:

Do your homework and your face time. Sorry guys, no way around it.  I tried. I bought seminars, strategies and signal service and still didn’t trust them enough to even use them. Thousands of dollars down the drain. Know your indicators, know your timeframe, know your tools (fibs, pivots, pitchfork,,,). You will learn that PRICE IS NOT OBEDIENT TO ANYTHING ALL THE TIME. So with that knowledge,  REPAINTING IS A NON-ISSUE. Tools and indicators help us interpret price action, not predict it. Which is why we can all see the same screen and  each see a different outcome.  So take some of the burden off of the hosts of these threads…..they are not prophets… they are just better at interpreting...

Some of these guys here are excellent at what they do: HH-bottom up analysis, FreddyFX- scalping, Robby2007- top down analysis, to name a few but they are winners because they understand the psychology behind the trade.  No way for the rest of us to cheat our way there.  When I accepted that, I was able to increase my probabilities of a winning trade because I now understand the psychology of my trade. (Kudos for them taking the time to help us.)

Sorry if I sounded like a preacher but I hope this helps somebody. So... find a mentor here on FF. Follow them, understand the psychology of their trades...it will help you get to the "promise land" faster.

BTW-Not advertisement for me. I am a newbie! No way a mentor yet!

PS: My trades are still marinating!

So... I took the aud/usd instead of the eur/aud.  Aussie proved weak against the usd which was good but the eur/aud went short instead of long.  I know some of the seasoned traders would stay in this aud/usd trade and ride out the retracement. But dont forget... I am just a flea on the elephants back.   so.. I "takes" mine where I can "gets" mine!

When I work my way through these fears of the newbie trademark, I may ride it out OR maybe just keep this style of trading up... it seems to work for me. LOL

Stay tuned!

but that is it for me for today guys. Happy Trading!

Can't agree more, the problem is that Brokers, Introducing Brokers, Signal Services, Commercial systems makes us think that we will be rich from night to morning, and they only want to rip you off a couple of hundreds, and then the little bug remanins like a disease in your brain until you can't take it anymore and you dig in your pocket (or borrow) some more money because you think that you can make your lost hundreds back, you often thing that YOU MADE THE MISTAKE, and looking back this phrase comes to mind "I AM SO STUPID, THE SELL WAS SCREAMING, I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOUGHT", and it seem easy that the next time you will be right, well, to be profitable in this business you have to pay what it takes, like a doctor studies for 8 years and they keep doing it until they die, an architect, lawyer, you name it, everyone can be profitable in forex, you just have to go to the university for the necessary years until you master it, unfortunately we start by learning a "SYSTEM", and not the background and hystory of currency trading, what happened 10 years ago, what worked at that time, and how it developed to be what it is today, if you are not an economist "THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS IN FOREX ARE THE BASICS", let me name them for you:

1. SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

2. TRENDLINES

3. FIBS

4. PSYCH LEVELS, ROUND NUMBERS

All this applied across multiple timeframes, only then you can grab a simple moving average and be profitale with it, because you will not be looking at the SMA, you will be looking through it.

That is why i do not like teaching "System" that i use, because behind them i have a lot of desitions and analisys that i do before making a trade, so my system might not work for you like they work for me....

Enough this is getting too long, besides i think this thread was made for people that has already a little experience in forex, trading the 1M chart can be a suicide for a newbie...

I think we have to focus in trading itself, no other better way to learn that to analize entries, exits, trends and ranges, with pictures...

"Enough this is getting too long, besides i think this thread was made for people that has already a little experience in forex, trading the 1M chart can be a suicide for a newbie..."

LOL...still sore from the whippin' the 1 min TF gave me when I first started it. But always been too hard headed for my own good! Although I will trade it, I prefer the 5 min TF!

But only two things can happen in the market - get spanked or get bank!

...but'cha gotta catch me to beat me (ask my folks) and for some of you who are starting to think I dont have a life outside of trading and FF....you caught me! Guilty as charged!

XStorm....sorry, but if I see that name, for some reason you make me think about KMart, lol.

I was training a new student the past hrs., so could not do everything at the same time.

My vision is that trading should be like riding your bike or driving your car.

If you have not reached that level YET, stay away from live trading.

There are far too many complicated setups on the forums, basically trading is SOOOO easy.

You learned to walk, ride your bike, drive your car, so you should be capable of learning how to trade.

I am ONLY interested in finding the good entry, the rest is for my "secretary" to handle.

I don't need any SL, I am an engineer, know what I am capable of, and in forex also know how to handle anything.

As for HA candles, much too slow for me, I am out with profit before that shows me to even get in.

Don't swim with the sharks any longer than needed.

Forex is not a game for me, it is a business with real income.

Hope this gives you an idea, buddy.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
More newbie news....

So, the aud/usd dropped about 140 pips from my entrance.... Got out on the first retracement but didnt jump back in on the Lower High.

So the lesson here today was...let your winners run!

The question is hows the strategy doing in ranging market

--- 帖子 #507 ---
If you can see the extent of the range you can scalp between these, check the HH charts, they are filled with great advice

--- 帖子 #508 ---
An interesting picture about trend vs ranging markets.  Use a few indicators to determine trend vs ranging markets.

The bottom window long term bbmacd lets me know that the trend has not reversed yet, and we are in a ranging period. The macd complete and stochastics are pointed up but the bbmacd is still pointed down.

The range is about 50 pips wide so we can scalp that range on a lower time frame

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Freddy on HA candles, for the 1 minute, I use an ma cross for entries, HA candles on a longer time frame for direction...works very well for me. I believe I mentioned that in the thread, that price crossing that MA gets me in the trade, the HA's usually follow on the 1 min

Let me make this very clear for everyone, I never wait on the 1 min for a candle to open or close,,,I trade when price crosses the line.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
If everyone has read the thread up to this point, I have posted some interesting examples of how to trade HA candles.

It is a very simple approach from the 5 minute time frame up. draw a line enter the trade when price crosses that line, with a few indicators for direction, or confirmation and you can bank many pips.

All you have to do to see this is put some HA candles on a chart with a line chart a different color, and watch for a period of time and you get the visual of the swings.   Then you can develop a trading method to trade those swings using indicators of your choice.

1 min time frame takes a bit more practice.  I will always entertain other peoples ideas about trading.

Have fun HH

Another tool I use that is standard in Mt4

Okay... this is it for me today.  Had to sweat for my pips today!  A couple of false starts on the 5m (choppy, choppy). Missed the 61.8 bounce but finally got in for the bounce off the 50.0 for 41 pips. Since I entered in late...I kept all 3 lots on the table.

LRC is an outdated indicator in the forex world, buddy.

I got followed by the Center of Gravity and also that one is outdated already.

I can see how long you are in forex by mentioning the LRC, lol.

I have not seen you mention any indicators that you use for trading the 1 min time frame....I dont use it any more either...LOL

By the way, what do you use for entry criteria on the 1 min time frame, you have not mentioned that either, you just jump in the room and say how easy it is to trade, but never talk about your trading setup.  Either put up or shut up

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Freddyfx is correct in one of the things he says, trading is soooo easy when you get the concept. If you dont have anything positive to say about trading, then keep it to yourself.  This room is about sharing positive things about trading the rest is left out.

Thanks hharrington,

never really tought about trading on 1 minute charts.

wow....I still hope we all have the same goal in mind - to become the best at what we do using the assistance of those who are already the best at what they do.  Just a thought.....

....but moving right along....

I too use the LRC but I prefer to use the NLRC which is also the out-dated COG. But I think that every indicator has its use and the LRC/NLRC should be apart of every trader's arsenal. As for me, it helps when the market is ranging and gives me a heads up when market conditions are about to change.  On Friday, the the NY session was a bust because of so much movement during the London session I guess. So...we had to grab the crumbs off the table.  To do that, I find regression channels are great on the 1 min TF! (Aud/Usd chart)

Xstorm - I've been trying the TMA indicator for similar reasons, and has been helpful. Wouldn't mind having a look at this if you are so inlcined to post it, couldn't find either

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I know that this indicator has been a topic but I didnt see one posted. I have posted mine below.

To change the aggressiveness of the channel to make it slower: go to "regression degree" and change to 1 or 2.  Default I think is 3.

Hi Freddie, given that HH is presenting some ideas here FOC and with open access I think it is pretty decent. If you read between the lines, you'll realise that indis, templates etc are "use what works for you". I know that this has made me suscessfully transition from demo to live.

took a few pips today

--- 帖子 #532 ---
You are more than welcome.

So today's aud/usd trade story:  It didnt do what it was "supposed" to do on the 5 min TF which was to head long for a strong finish at S1 (1.0724).  But, nooooooo! Failed at S3 (twice) headed for S2 (Yes!) BUT then failed to break the hefty seller linebackers, blocking the path to my field goal. (Just downright reprehensible folks!)

So being the tick that I am on this great big elephant, I follow tick rule number 1: if you cant beat'em, join'em. So short takes us back down to channel where London folks get off the elephant.

So this makes up for my two losses yesterday. But, when you break tick rules and regs, that is what'cha get! But no worries, was smart enough to keep losses small.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
This is NFP week...normally I stay away from the market because it is even more unpredictable.  But, I have reduced my lots and rolling the dice.

Thinking about going long on the aud/usd.  Waiting for it to break the S3 area and take the first higher low or if it retraces back to SM4, that would be a better entry for a long.

Let's see what the elephant is going to do today...

Anybody else taking a chance during NFP week? or have an opinion about the Usd index?

The Aussie dollar has been short the last few days.

You can trade any timeframe you wish below the 4 hr when the 4 hr is trending like this.

IMO, the 4 hr is king for direction if you trade the shorter timeframes.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
So, as mentioned before, price was having a hard time breaking S3.  It proved to be a very strong barrier.  It did take the bounce back down to the opposite side of the channel (past SM4). Tick rules require to ride the elephant where ever he goes! So it does not matter what I think is going to happen, it is always best to stick to your trading rules! (I still think it is getting ready to reverse, I'll just have to be ready when it does)

All my analysis is done from the 5m TF.  BUT I have 1hour candlesticks and mtf indicators as HH suggest.  I think each TF tells it's own truth.... HH is a gifted trader who has traded for more than nine years.  I still get confused with top down analysis so I do what works for me.  I look forward to one day having his level of trading competence.

Aud/Usd looked crazy this morning at 12:00 gmt. Decided to wait until after the USD news.  Dropped down to 1min chart because I didnt plan to be in the market long today. It's hump day and I am starting to feel drained.

Sorry to post my chart after the fact because I like to show what I do/did and why I do/did it. (I figure if I am wrong, someone will stop my madness!) But nevertheless here is the aud/usd.  There was great confluence at the 5/8 (range top) and the NLRC.  Bottom indies agreed with the move so I jumped in on my trigger which was the MA crossover.

I have no more energy for the markets.  NFP week anyway, which is normally my week off to get rested after last months activities. (The markets will stress you out if you let it!) So that is it for me! See ya next week!

Seems like this thread is becoming a ghost town. I see tumbleweeds....

So I bought up the subject that I believe each TF tells its own truth and that I only analyze from one TF because of the confusion of top down analyse (for me anyway).  HH's bottom up system works way better for me because it makes more sense.(IMHO)  I am not challenging anyone's style of trading, perhaps my brain is wired backwards?

And I have no patience for Higher TF because it seems confluence is critical.  That means MORE waiting than usual.  But the great part about trading is, there is a TF and a strategy that works for every personality out there!

So here is a Eur/Jpy 1 min TF: it was headed down, now swinging up.  So many opportunities to make pips there.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now check out the 5 min.  It shows the trend never changed. It was only retracement but still pips to be made with each swing!

As I mentioned before, no more trading for me until next week.  But I still study and journal my observations.

Hi hharrington, I have been playing around with heiken ashi smoothed for a while for my own purposes and found something interesting. I wanted to put the 15 min heiken ashi smoothed on the 1 min chart so changed the settings to 2, 90, 3, 30. It works fine and shows the direction of the 15 min trend visually on the 1 min chart. Then I applied a 200 ema to the 1 min chart and found that they are almost exactly the same. Curious. Anyway, not sure if you'd ever thought of doing this so thought I'd run it past you, you might find the idea useful.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Its so good to see everyone back!

(This is to answer a pm question)

So when I first started trading, I use to sweat bullets! Stomach was in knots! (You know the story.) Jumped out of the good ones too fast and stayed in the bad ones too long.  But then on a trip to Vegas I realized people were losing ALL the time but still having fun.  The fun was in the possibilities! They never concentrated on the losses but continuously placed money in the slot machines because they were looking forward. Each pull of the lever offered a dream come true!

Some days trading, my brain was on pause or reverse- not forward. I started looking at trading the same way as the people in Vegas except that I had an advantage - technical analysis and indicators.  So each day I pick a machine (a pair) watch the strategy line up, pull the lever and BAM I am in!  "Come to papa baby!" (thats me talking to the pips)  I can tell you that I still dont win them all but loosing is part of this game too! But guess what, each pull of the lever offers a dream come true!

But everyday that I trade, it is a trip to Vegas! Win or lose....

All the indicators are in the thread someplace, if you are too lazy to put the indicators together and build your own template, then I guess you should move on.....

There is nothing free in life, but if you use your eyes and ears there is a lot of information available.

HH

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I like this thread's boss'es method, I do the same.

The 1min chart gives you an amazing clarity and it gives you time! Every minute, you get told how the fight between up and down resumed. Just sit there and wait wait wait. Dont even interpret any bars or indicators. sit there and tell yourself, this is what the bears achieved, and this is the bulls result. Then after one hour at most (NY session) you will have a crystal clear opinion on which side has the power. Many many small bars allow you to wait before a thundering swing takes place - one that you wouldnt be able to find on the 5min chart!

The thread man said it dozens of times, all you need is watching the pair every day for some time, there is nothing new under the sun! at least every second day, you get a situation where one side is breaking away in complete panic, and the swing holds on for hours. wait for these moments and go into the market with full weight.

PS: i dont even use trendlines, sometimes EMAs, and no heiken ashi. its all about time. watch and watch for many hours.

Dont ask too much, just let the chart teach you for some weeks and some dozens of hours. And learn to sit there, doing nothing - it pays you more than jumping in every little move.

Success and insight everyone

HH is right.  The template is already in this thread, you may have to add or take away an indicator or two.  And if you don't read HH's directions, all of the templates are useless.  So it is best to start at the top.

i guess i will stop here..but thanks alot and God Blessed those who helps by the way.

no worries....did not mean to offend.  Made an assumption in which I was incorrect so I apologize.  The WC_NLR works much like a shi channel except that it moves with and anticipates price action - like CoG.  For me it is essential for determining confluence but as you know...nothing is 100%!

This is to be my last "newbie news" post, at least for a while.  I have been given an offer “I cannot refuse” which means that I will not be able to share my screen shots or opinions of any trades. Here are three things that has helped me. I hope this can help you

1.Forget any negative thing you have been taught about money (“money doesn’t grow on trees”) because if you don’t, fear will always be foundation of your trading strategy, which translates into you breaking rules or jumping from one strategy to another more often than you should.

2.Remember, this is Vegas baby!  You are playing with pips for more pips. That is all.  Nothing more. If your life depends on a win or loss, your bet is too large against the house.  Take some pips off the table so you can play another day. You will stay in this game longer if you learn to master your greed.  It is hard but you will do it because you have to. (The House wins more often if we don’t learn to master greed and they are counting on it. After all, how many traders have learned to master it….less than 10%?).

3.And one last thing, in the beginnng, while you are still a newbie, you are a servant to your strategy. It is not the other way around until you learn to master self control. (I am still servant to my stragegy) but that lets you off the hook. If you do the same strategy more than 20 times and your losses are greater than your wins (in measure of pips), then it is the strategy, not you. This method takes the burden off your shoulders because you will understand, it is not you that is the loser, it is the strategy but you will only know this if you are servant to the strategy.

So that is it folks….Happy Trading!

Another great setup for those of you who want to trade longer term. I am using a TL EA for entries and exits on longer term charts.

I have not found a free one that works properly, or one that I can figure out how to use properly. There are a few good ones you can purchase on the internet...Magic Stick, and I think I-draw at forex geometry may be ok.

I am using Magic Stick, but I have not used I-draw

The 1 min chart requires a lot of practice on demo before you trade it live.

After much screen time, you recognize the swings then it becomes easy to trade.  If you just follow the 15 min trends on the 1 min you will see the light.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Listen folks there are no bad months to trade forex. After you have been at it for a while you will believe me.  The gurus preach all the time dont trade fridays and sundays or mondays...

If you are a trader you can trade anytime you choose.  You control what you do not the market.

The market shows you what to do after you learn how to read the charts. Then it is your choice, and only your choice to enter a trade.

Hope this thread stays alive, its a really great strategy!!

I was on GU too this morning. Basically when the 15m TF changes colour I look to get involved for an entry on the 1m chart. This gets you in at the start of a swing which I think is the most important bit. Getting entry on the 1m chart when you are midway through a swing lowers your R/R unless of course you are adding on ;0)   When I have all 3 (1m, 5m and 15m) Heikens, MACD in your favour, your pretty good to go.

Interesting thread - I downloaded your templates but they look nothing like the charts you are posting here and elsewhere on FF.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
thx for posting your strategy

--- 帖子 #589 ---
They are just fine tuned for my use...with most of the indicators in here. If you take the time and play around with your charts you can make them look like mine.

After all isn,t this about learning how to trade or do you want them handed to you on a Silver platter.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I will post an updated zip file with all of the indicators.  You will have to look at one of my charts that you like and make it the same..good practice on how to pull indicators around and set them up.

The method is the same on all charts, trade the lower time frames in the direction of the higher time frames, using some MTF indicators to see all the time frames on 1 chart. This way you do not have to keep switching charts to know where the higher time frames are.

I have plans in the near future to call some live trades for you. Don't pin me down to a date because I wont discuss when it will happen, but I will tell you before I start.

If you read thru the thread you should be able to gain enough knowledge about a simple method to trade with.  Its basically Price Action from some key times during the day, (24 Hrs.) with a few indicators to guide you.

Play with the indicators ,,presently I am using fewer and it does a better job.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Watch how the heikens swing with the color stochastics.  The 1 I have settings on 30 10 10 and the name of the indicator is color stochastics

Hint, if you want to trade the 5 min,,,set your mtf heiken 2 time frames up

Then set your T3 HAMA on the main chart 1 time frame up...when they all agree and the stochastics has turned you should be good to go.

When this is in trend, I then scalp all the pull backs on that time frame until the move is over, or you can drop down to the 1 min and take all the trades in the same direction on the 1 min.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Here are the indicators I am presently using in my chart setups.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Thats what I thought.  I trade the one minute also.  I put the MTF 5 on the chart & MTF 15 below it and you can take trades when both agree.  The MTF 5 usually has a retrace/pullback & you can enter once both colors on the MTF agree again.  Nice approach.

Thanks,

Dan

Hello all...

Been into trading for a few years, still definitely a newbie... silent reader since yesterday. I read this thread over and over, took a few notes, downloaded every file posted in the thread. Thanks for the templates and indicators everyone by the way. Having fun with the strategy, as I usually do when I come across one as simple and clean as this one. Haven't slept since the markets opened up yesterday. Lost most of my (demo) trades because there is something I am doing wrong. I'm sure I'll figure it out. I think I may need to actually step away from the screen for awhile and then come back with a fresh thinker. I kinda feel like I'm on the opposite end of the learning curve because mostly everyone here are gettin they 'pip' on. I read the complaints, too. I think this strategy is definitely a sleeper. Some readers from the beginning disappeared towards the middle I guess because they couldn't figure it out or thought it isn't a good strategy. Just wanted to say that most times a bad strategy is just an overlooked good strategy. HH you are a cool cat. I like the fact that you get str8 to it, and I have been chuckling at the fact that you guys don't take no sh..t!!... (one of the reasons this is my first comment on this thread) Truth be told it actually takes less time to go back and read the thread than it does to wait for a response. OK, everyone! Thanx for the knowledge, and I'll keep reviewing the thread and practicing till my pip game gets better. Keep it "pippin" y'all. Don't forget to take showers and eat something.

Good Morning Everyone!  Know I haven't posted in a while, however I still follow this thread.  (Cant post my charts but can make comments)

@AppleJuice

Glad that you are on board.  You have a point about people leaving the strategy, perhaps the system is too hard or they didnt get good results.  You said that you were having some issues...perhaps maybe you could post a couple of pictures so we can have a look-see....? I think we all here are trying to become more excellent traders and others maybe having the same issue as you. So, in a way you can be of great assistance to others.

HH means well otherwise he wouldnt have posted this strategy.  He does, however, have a low tolerance for laziness. Sometimes threads become inundated with questions that have been answered over and over again and these tread require a lot of work and time - it's almost like having another job. (Try getting through hundreds of pages with the same question!) So the point here is try to avoid that as much as possible so those who really want to learn may do so.

You are doing the correct things: reading the thread and demo-ing. So if you continue to run into the same issue that is causing you to lose....please share a picture. That way we can pitch in to help.

Happy Trading!

A simple setup, which i have mentioned many times in the thread.

Start out with something easy and then add your favorite indicators.

There is a HA 1 min, HAMA 5 min, price on close and 1 hr candles on this chart, nothing else.   Can you pick out the places where you would have entered short.   HMMMMMMM

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Simple is by Far the best!

I am using a very similar Template to you. I am using the 1m chart for entrys, 15m chart for Trend and peeping a look at the 4hr chart for overall Trend which tells you if you have if you are going to get decent 15m swings. One thing I have learnt recently to increase your 'edge' you need to get in the market when the 15m swings have just started (first couple of bars). I have setup the HAMA Alert which tells me when the 15m Heiken as changed. You can get 2 or 3 changes per day during London Session depending on market conditions.

Making progress

Cheers

Hi,

If anyone is still using the bb macd indi, can you please inform what the settings should be, if they have been posted already, which post are they on?

Thanx...

Almost got this thing figured out... I've been watching these charts religiously all day!

Pretty much broke even on my trades because my stop loss levels were wrong. So I should see profit today!

I do not have much experience in forex trading but I prefer to 15 minute, 30 minute and 1 hour time frame.

@ AppleJuice

If you are using HH's template with the BB Macd...i think that it already has the correct settings: 38, 120, 20, .55.

Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Use whatever time frame pleases you. Personally I trade all time frames, and if you spend a lot of time in front of the screen trading the 15 min or higher, its a plus if you scalp the 1 min in the same direction.  Something to do.

Take a 15 min trade that runs for 60 or 70 pips and look at it on the 1 min, and see how many opportunities there were on the 1 min tf in the same direction.

HH

--- 帖子 #605 ---
i like the indy.  still trying to decide best setting.  might depend on time frame.

i have seen settings of 144, 233, 21, 1.1

and

38, 120, 20, 1.1

very different signals.

if you find out which is best let us know.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Do what I have done, compare both of them.   And pick the 1 that suites your trading style. On the shorter settings, I would not have taken the last 3 trades long.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Bonsoir à toutes et tous,

Wouah! I am not really a newbie, but so in fact I am one ! Lol.

I read tens of thread one FF. For months, not to say years but it is good the first time when I read such a strategy.

Simplicity, intelligence, logic, efficiency !

While reading I made out a will on today EU, trades only 3. But every winners. Fortunate. Lol

Just to say that I am now with you. Thank you HH it is the beautiful free present which you make us.

This strategy is made for me. It is good the first time !

As what the patience, the reading and the work eventually pay...

Thank's a lot

What settings have you used for the HA smooth and why ?

D

--- 帖子 #615 ---
]

WYFX Clear Chart  17/43 EMA's

HA MA T3 New   MA 17, 2, 1, True, True False

MA Croosver Histogram 7,4

I like the 17/43 EMA for trading and thought it might be a good guage for trend so I applied it to the Clear Chart. This will give overall trend while using the HA and Price to determine entry. It seems to be very visual and easy to follow.

The MA Crossover histogram will give you an early warning of Price direction changes.

I like visual Charts that are easy to interpret, that is why I was experimenting and came up with this combination. Best on M30 to me?

Any suggestions for improvement welcome.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Wow I like this it is very easy on the eyes. Can you share indicators and template. All we need is a good filter and we will be in business. I like how it shows longer term trend on there as well.

Thanks milosz

--- 帖子 #623 ---
When you see the blue "X" on the chart it means that the current trend maybe coming to an end or retracement (according to your settings).

Merry Trading!

PS.  on the shorter TFs, please wait until candle closes to be sure

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I need to say that this is something i was looking for. I'm using first setup. With HA on 1min and 15 min. Great Thread. Simple easy to find trends easy to get in to trends. With losses Trades In 4 Days with 26 Entries i get almost 100 pips, and this is just beginning. It's true that only thing you need to do is to look and fallow the chart thats all after few hours you will start to see trends and entries. Great Tread, great strategy

Yes I banked at 15-20 then moved my stop to BE. I was aware it was against the 15m trend (HL`s) so I started banking early doors.

EU EJ where the trades to take this afternoon I watched them go by and was all ready in the AU.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
You should go for EJ i did with 52+ pips but i'm mad at myself i could stay with charts instead i put my take profit order  . I could have at least +80-90 pips today. I also get on EU but only take 10+ pips and AU +10 but i have got -10 on AJ and -12 on EJ cuz get on it too early. Still good day by freebie rules

For any newbies out there, I´ve been trading for 15 years, blew 2 full accounts, studied tons of systems...only to BE since a year or so...

HH mastered this business (I can sense that )

so....be humble, talk little , open your eyes , study and learn...like he puts it..it´s free anyway..

--- 帖子 #647 ---
may i know about your money management, because i want to use 5 % per trade using this system(1 m trade using 5 m trend)[/quote]

MM humble sugestion:

Correct position size + a proven consistent winning system= $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Trade with OANDA, I´m not a fan from them, they are as good or bad as the others, except, you don´t trade lots, except on their MT4 plattform which I use for my charting. You trade in money not in lots or micro lots.

Adjust every entrance to your position size, (to the cent). Meaning your stop distance is always the same $ value, 1 min or dayly or whatever chart.

That´s your risk, R , always the same.

In my opinion anything bigger than 2 % is wild...the best system might produce 10 loosers in a row...you know, crazy market, own mistakes..etc...sooner or later it happnes...you loose half of your account and most of your confidence.

Check this:

4 trades a day (yes a lot of work)

1% risk per trade (comfortable and fun)

Average R expectancy =0,5 (win loose, etc.. average Rs you make)

Makes 2 % a day!

Makes 10 % a week.!!

OK so far?

Now 10 percent a week, starting with humble 1000 account...

Compound:

after 48 weeks, (1 year): 97017 (dollars or euros your choice in the menu a la carte)

after 2 years: 9412314 (yes that´s more than 9 million!)

after 3 years you have lunch with Warren... (Buffett)

Problem is at one point the brokers don´t take huge leveraged orders, I think Oanda ´s limit is 10 million...so you need to split orders , etc...a nice problem to have, considerning most human beings in this planet survive on 1 dollar a day...

Sorry for the long answer, but it´s fun...excell don´t lie.

Just don´t break it too soon risking too big...otherwise Warren will be waiting with his  soup getting cold..

HEY LONG ANSWERS ARE GREAT

I never risk more than 3 per cent of my total account.

If you trade the 1 min time frame stop any trade that goes against you 5 pips if your broker will allow you.  You will have lots of losers, but the winners far outweigh the losers.  10 pips is my max stop loss on the 1 min TF.

I always look for 5 pips or more on the 1 min for profit taking

Let the winners run, you pickup lots of 1 min trades that run for 20 30 0r 40 pips. Somtimes you get in one and it runs for 70 or 80.  Hit a couple of those and quit for the day.

If the trend is really strong put on a trailing stop and let it run.

In conclusion, my target is 3 percent daily

Interesting!

there´s a thread out there (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=245149)

... were some folks trade for thousands of pips...enter on H or 15,move to BE asap. then let it run...following the weekly and monthly trends...some  of them claim they make millions...takes a ton of patience... like getting stopped at BE, or small loss 30 times in a row to get just  one position running your way for months.

Using HH awsome entries, I will experiment , just for  kicks, here and there...enter on 1 M, BE asap, then trail on the 4 Hour or even dayly!

Talking about a 1 / 50 Ratio!!??

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Thank you so much for the compliment.  I worked for months on what I considered a "psych" template. One that will show the PA on the pivot, mml and fib on any TF.  One on which all other indicators would just add confirmation but not direction.  And that was the result.  It has brought me much success and I hope you much success also.

Merry Trading my friend!

P.S:  This template was also designed so that Top Down analysis would not be necessary.  As I have said many times before "each TF has its own story to tell."  Many may not agree but it works for me.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Oh and one more thing, so I dont sound so self serving.  I choose Harrington's thread because I found his method to be sound and that it brought life to my template.  So, many thanks to Harrington for his bottom-up trading method.  It makes SO MUCH SENSE!

Here is a trade the EA you posted about which was initiated by the EA this morning. Yes I have had 2 winners in the last 24 hours taking 20 pips off each but this trade is currently under water by 50 or so. With MM like 1 looser wipes out 4 winners I am all ready thinking about taking it of the charts unless this wants to turn around very soon.

The original strategy would never have put me in long there and had short all over it like the NU trade I am currently in.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I ran it on 6 pairs consecutively.  It had some losers, but way more winners than losers, which you need with the reverse RR.

Just something to play with.  Not recommending you trade with it.  EA's interest me, but the problem is there are too many scam artist's on the internet.  How do you find one that really works.  At least they let you try before you purchase this one.

gtudor,

I knew I had those candles that you were looking for (I hope).  They are called Heiken Ashi V but they are set at 24, I think.  Perhaps you can adjust it....?

Hi,

Could anybody be so kind (HH?) to keep posting some examples of how you successfully trade this strategy?

I recognize it as a very good one, but I haven't been able to profit from it consistently...

Because I can't be glued to the charts, some times when I come to check them, the movement may already started, so I try to reenter at the touch of the HAS Bars or the 20 SMA (typically very close to each other).. and that is precisely when it was turning around... if I wait a little longer to confirm it will continue in my way I loose several pips trying to enter with market orders and a lot of requotes and retrys. (Maybe this is a Broker issue, but an issue anyway)

So I would like to here from you, more or less how do you determine when to enter and when not to enter in those circumstances, when the start of the movement already passed.

Thanks in advance

Mariano

PS. I'm trading the 1M TF

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I do not trade this method but one very similar and have successfully for years. I also do not trade forex but can tell you this isn't a 'method' issue but rather a 'trader' issue.

Personally, if I miss a trade based on my rules I miss the trade. I do not go chasing after it but rather wait until the next proper set-up. In my opinion you're either present at the time the opportunity presents itself in which you take the trade or you're not in which case you wait for the next set-up.

There is NEVER a need to chase a trade, NEVER.

Good luck.

I've been following the thread for a week or so and have slowing been sorting out my MT4 to display the indicators this strategy requires.

I had a question about the HA smoothed.  It might not matter much but I'm curious if it's a setting config or diff indicator all together that HH has that shows the candles with full bodies.  My indicator shows upper wicks on both bullish and bearish candles.

Any advise?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Open up the indicator settings dialogue box. Under the tab 'colours' change the first 2 in the list red+blue to 'none'. Voila you should now have got rid of the wicks.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Thanks...it did!

What settings do you have the MA set for wingate?

I ask b/c you can still get wicks with different setting setups.

Have you been having success with this system?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Hi all,

I actually registered because of this thread, it's the sistem i would very much like to use.

I've been checking it out many times from the begining and there's something i really don't get - the very first picture. How do you get your graf to look like that?

Hope it isn't stupid question, but somehow i can't get the beginning right.

Thanks,

Hi dcabfx,

Sorry not been around for a few days. 6,2,2,3 are the ma settings in the indicator that I am using ie, an HA smoothed mtf indicator. I am not using this system however, just read your post and thought I may be of help.

Glad to hear that you managed to remove the wicks!

I always try to trade the 15m in the direction of the 4 hr trend.  In my opinion, the 4 hr is king for trend.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi HH,

this is my first post on this thread and I've just found it 3 days ago, after I looked through thousands of systems in FF and nearly about to give up.

I've just finished first 12 pages, not because I'm a slow reader but cos I read them for three times , downloaded every screenshot you attached, read every word carefully, I like your instructions on pic, they are very clear and elaborate and deliver your idea in such a direct way, the way to make people catch key points at first glance.

Everytime I read your words, I can learn something new, especially when I try to use the method in market. The magic thing is, your method can make me stay for whole day before screen, visualizing, thinking, researching, w/o any impatience, it never happened before, when I couldn't be quiet before screen and the chart looks boring which always made me sleepy. I think the reason of this big change is I'm gradually learning to master the way to visualize chart, to feel the market, with your help of course.

Now I am still trying best to absorb this thread, I am still at an entry level, compared with 10y experience like you, I know I still have a lot to learn, eg, how to handle different tfs, how to distinguish false signals, how to deal with repaints, how to add-on compound positions, etc. well, it's okay, as long as I've got a target, the target is now attached on the wall I face, quoted by you, "trading is a wait game for right opportunity", and ,"trading is a very visual thing. The same thing happen over and over and over again. If you can grasp the concept then you will see the market in a way that benefit you".

Btw, the way you type and speak reminds me of an old friend, a really old friend, he helped me a lot during my work, who is the master of the field and worked for 40y+. Although in the very beginning I cann't quite understand the way he expressed his idea(we both are not native speaker), in the end I'm the best one who can understand him, your thread makes me miss him very much(I've lost contact after I left that company). I think that maybe the reason why I feel quite warm when reading your post, even at the first glance.

Oh, I nearly forgot to attach the pic of today, two white trend lines are where I placed short,that's the best score I've ever made since I joined Forex club, the feeling's name is: let profit run!!!

Hello HHarrington & all,

I finished reading all posts and started trading using HH´s aproach on M1 using M15 HA as trend confirmation.

Managed some good deals  like this one

http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/3170/hhstrategy1.png

but then, when the market consolidates/goes sideways I lose it all in false entries and get whipsawed (2-3 candles blue, 2-3 red, etc.... sideways market).

Can you help me with some advice on how to filter and stay out of those trades.

Thanks

DC

Hi HH, glad to see you around.... I'll bite, I'm interested to know you current trading model :nerd:

I am still in scalper mode, looking for quick trades between GMT 10-12 on EU. Systems such as yours work with proper MM as they are based on sizing up a trend in real 1m TF... a trend or countertrend within a trend.

Look forward to the read!

Hi HH,

I'm soooooooo glad to see you around again!!! I even thought you have left and would never be back, which made me so sad, after so many trials I've found a good thread eventually, but my friend who opened it unexpectively abandoned it

How lucky I'm to see u back, and a big hug for you

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hi HH,

in this case, what is the right reasoning?

S1 - look into long: I have a  3ball south so I  look for long. MA8 crossed north, blue HA, I have a pullback and a cross of one indicator.

S2 - look into short: I evaluate this as a pullback during a (fresh) downtrend (as HA15 is red), price crossed MA8 down and Stoch is not yet pointing up.

http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/8...1jun032024.jpg

Some more questions:

early in the presentation of your approach you indicated that you enter a trade when price breaks a trendline and use a trendline EA for entry.

Later on, you indicated you enter when price crosses MA8.

You use both entries or you moved from A to B ?

Do you buy on simple cross?  Would the close  below the line or MA not be safer entry?

Thx and a good week,

--- 帖子 #725 ---
I use all of the above.  For scalping I am taking all trades in the direction of the 15 min HAMA on the 1 min charts. I will post some examples

For longer term trading I am trading the 15 or 30 min charts in the direction of the 4 hr HAMA.

I use trendline breakouts only on longer term trading.

Yes I use price crossing the 8 moving average when I am scalping the 1 min, and the 15 min hama agrees

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Here are some examples

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Some indicators you may like.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
As you can see by the above charts when price crosses the 8 moving average its a good entry, if the 15 min charts agree.

Its really easy if you keep it simple

HH

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Thanks, HH, for your input.

In your examples you only use HAMA15. So you dont look at e.g. Stoch for early warning and take whatever M8 cross ?

I attach some trades I took today with my comments. Hope you can give me some feedback.

I actually wonder if the M1 is the right one to trade (back from losses) my small account or if I should not move to higher levels. Less screentime, less trades and (maybe) less whipsaws, and I feel my many small losses on M1 I could have afforded already some trades with higher risk per trade on M15 or up :-/

http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/5...01291456pm.jpg

Trade 4 – BE

On First retrace the M15 still red.   Maybe too late entry. Sold on first cross M8 south.

Trade 5 - 6 pips

Breakout of trendline with M8 cross and HA15 blue, then turned immediately below M8 again.

http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/4...01285236pm.jpg

Trade 1 - +8

Potential +12

In on 1,2,3 of first LH, out on first blue HA.  Should have closed when MA8 crossed.

Trade 2 -  -7

M15 was red, so used the M8 cross. Turned after ~3 pips back north.

Trade3 -  -7

M15 was still displaying red when price crossed M8 south. Quickly retraced

Trade4 - +3

Late in as I manually had to kill Trade3 and enter Trade4. Sold on cross with close under MA.

Issues: As I don’t get the line trader working on my MT4, I have to manually execute which rhymes with re-quotes

Thanks!

Put a 60 minute HAMA on a 15 min chart. It has an alert for direction change.

I still use the color stochastic in a bottom window for oversold and overbought, and also 2 bbmacd's at different settings. 38, 120, 20 and

144, 233, 20.  Both have to agree to take a trade

When you get a 60 min alert of a direction change on the HAMA, you then take a look at the 15 min chart and decide if you want to take the trade.

We are trading the 15 in the direction of the 1 hr.

Same setup on all timeframes, just adjust HAMA settings 1 min, 15 min HAMA etc etc

Have fun HH

I really pay attention to the daily open times guys and gals.

A lot of good trades begin around the 5PM open, the 8 PM Asia Open, the 2AM  Frankfurt Open, 3AM London Open, and the 8AM NY Open.

Make that a part of your daily routine, checking charts at those times, or at least at the times you are awake near 1 or 2 of them.

HH

--- 帖子 #735 ---
I find out 5 open lines are quite near each other right now, the price just moved 40pips or so from Sydney session(red line), I smell some big time will be coming, now NY(margenta line) has open already, just waiting for the big time. But I still have no ability to tell which direction it will go, up or down? seems both are possible, let's go and see!

--- 帖子 #736 ---
This is the thinking that keeps the market liquid for the real traders.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
This method went from really simple to complex in about 3 pages of posts.

This method is just as easy. Really what you have to do is be able to determine the trend. Then take the trades from the smoothed heiken ashi in continuation to the flow of the trend.

You can use a 100 SMA and daily pivot as a trend signal.

When price is above both the 100 SMA and daily pivot for the day look for longs.

When price is below both the 100 SMA and daily pivot for the day look for shorts.

You can still use the same location for the stop loss based on the swing high / swing low.

By apply this simple logic to your entries you have created a filter that when to enter trades, but the simplicity is still very easy.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Nothing complex about this method at all, just use whatever indicators that you prefer to determine the higher timeframe direction and take 1 min pullbacks  in that direction.

Pay attention to the open lines i have discussed thru out the thread, and you will get some easy trades.

Hi HH,

I was trading your approach and my winners get eaten up by more loser, probably wrong entries?!

Let me summarize what I understood:

M1 trading

As long as HAMA15 shows long, you trade on M1 all crosses of Price with MA8 north after a dip represented by a 2ball.

Your initial SL is -5 pips.   Your next SL is BE+5 pips (minimum gain).

M5 and higher

As long as the one or two higher timeframe (e.g. M5 &  M15 or M30) shows long, you put a trendline to the corrections onto the back of the M5 HAMA. You do not trade the cross of price with that trendline but you wait for a move north after crossing, then a dip back , ideally to  38-61 FIB level , represented by a 2ball.

Then you trade the 123 pattern, means: you enter when the high was taken???? Or do you enter on the retrace itself when e.g. 50% FIB is reached?

Here some pictures:

Hi HH,

thanks for the template. I attached it and  - wow - colors and blinking everywhere .

Now, pls help me to understand what I am looking at to enter.

Is it the alerts that pop-up? (it alerted me a couple of candles in a row that an entry is possible - so I e.g. wait until after many short, a general trend up alert pops to catch an early reverse similar to the trendline breaks?).

Or combined color coding of ultra signal, bb macd and HAMA?

No trendlines in this one for any entry then ?

Good Weekend,

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Here is what you need to do to be able to recognize the swings on a 1 min chart. Remember that 1 min trades last from 45 minutes to an hour. The normal reversal times on a 15 min chart are on average 45 minutes.

Load up a 5 min chart and put a 15 minute HAMA on it.

Every time the Macd 2 gets a yellow dot, mark a vertical line on your chart at that dot.

After 3 or 4 hours go back and look at the vertical lines on a 1 min chart.

This gives you some insight on where 1 minute entries happen when the 5 minute agrees.

Notice how the ultra trend line on the chart keeps you in trades and allows you to take pullbacks.

Until you get used to trading a 1 min chart, use only the 15 min hama even on the 1 min charts. Only trade when the 15 min agrees in direction, this will keep you on the right side of the market all the time with the 1 min.

The idea is to get in when the 15 changes direction with 1 trade, and add to it with multiple trades on the 1 min, until the 15 stops going in that direction. Think about it for a while. When the 15 min swing has finished you bank your pips and you are done trading for the day.

HH

The dolly graphics is a multi TF helper. It gives you info on what the 15 min charts and the 1 hr charts are doing without changing timeframes. It can be your best friend in trading if you learn how to read it.

I dont use it for entries, just information on what is happening on the higher timeframes.

All indicators I post in here are for your evaluation only.  Its up to each individual to build a trading method for themselves. The ideas presented here are in actual use every day.

Hi HH

In your template HA mov avarage is set to TF 5. In some posts above UR talking about M15 as a higher TF. I am conffused a little bit.

I have been here since 3 am this morning, and I have banked over 120 pips using this template that you are complaining about. What have you done.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Hi HH

How important for U are informations about trend given by Dolly indi on the left side of the screen? At this moment "M15 Trend Analysis" on EU is showing STRONG BEARISH TREND. Does it mean U avoid long trades even all condtions listed below are met?

Correct me if i am wrong:

to go long

1. Macd and BBmacd should be in the same colour (blue)

2. Ultra signal blue

3. HAMA blue

Best regards

Iwan

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I use that information along with the indicators on the chart.

The most important thing is the ultra trend indicator which I posted a while back. If price is below that I will agree with the dolly and keep taking shorts.

Good example of this is the EU from the eur and london opens this morning. Look at the 2 indicators in the bottom window, and the ultra trend signal is short all the way down.

This is a 5 min chart so you could take all the pullbacks if you wish in the short direction.

I added a couple of times and when price gets above the ultra trend I will exit all positions

You can monitor the 1 min chart for re-entering

You can trade with just these 3 indicators on the chart. Ultra trend for direction, bbmacd 2 of them, I mentioned the settings before.

HH

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Am I cherry picking trades to show you my method, yes I am. But if you can grasp the concept then pretty soon you will be taking these trades.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hi HH,

how did you get into those positions?

Looking at your sell entries, you bought on FIB retraces in this case.

http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/1...01293641pm.jpg

Why you did not apply MA8 cross or trendline breakouts?

In more detail:  on first retrace: you dont take 38, you waited for 50.

In second retrace you waited for 62.

How do you distinguish if you enter 38, 50 or 62 ?

How you deal with re-quotes ? If you enter manually, that might spoil a nice entry, especially when ranges are small.

Or do you put a sell order on the FIB value?

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Just trade candle formations beneath the ultra trend going in the same direction. When you get a pull back take the reversal short, if it does not go short, just wait it will. as long as the ultra trend is short.

Sometimes add ons have draw down for a bit. Dont worry about it just take the trade and leave it on. Put a stop loss above the last high if that makes you happy.  I just have a large stop until all of my postions get into profit. Its called building a position.

HH

HH, i have to say that i like your thread because any time i visit it i can find sth new but main concept of trading  is the same all the time, and thats great.

I have opened EU M1 chart yesterday for all day and watching what will happen. It was specific day because of strong trend in one direction. Lets see how it works in range day.

If you dont mind please post charts from last 2-3 days with ideal entry points marked with VERTICAL LINES (it is very important) to let me know exact entry candles.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Hi HH,

ok, so if price aligns with ultra trend you then sit back and wait until it goes either direction before you take any further entries on pullbacks?

http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/1...01281220am.jpg

And what do you do when the price goes just back and forth like that:

Seriously, that is a part of the holy grail, right ? Knowing when to stay away.....

@ HH: how you filter non-trending from trending ? When you stay out, when you enter, using your technique?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Use the next higher or 2 higher timeframes, and only take pullbacks in that direction.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Take trades only in the direction of the next higher timeframe

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Maybe this picture will help.  Do y'all understand 1,2,3 trades or A, B, C trades.....this is a prime example of them going in the direction of the 5 min timeframe on the 1 min chart.

Just give it a try sometime on a demo platform.

1,2,3 would mean you buy the breakout,,,,, (price reached point 3 and you enter when point 2 is taken again)

But I understand you buy the drawback itself at 50% ?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #770 ---
You buy at the 3, for the obvious reason,,,no drawdown, instantly goes into profit Google fx pullback trading and see if you come up with some good info. Buying on the pullbacks means exactly that you buy on the pullback, not on the next high after the pullback. You put your order in at the C with a small stop, or stop above or below the A depending which direction you are trading.

I will post another example

Where you put the "not here" is where you enter.

Thanks for the thread.  Just came across it yesterday and it looks very interesting.  I've read through the first 15 pages or so.  Is it best to start from the beginning and move all the way through or is there a better place to start as the thread has no doubt evolved.

Thanks in advance and look forward to participating.

if I can make a suggestion....

I would not have taken that entry because the HAMA was turning flat there and the two best entries would have been to your left during the frankie session. Especially on 1 min, you want to take those juicy pull backs against the 5 min trend but it has to be a nice steep trend so you know you have a higher chance of success with the overall momentum on your side.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
OK, how about this ?  Pullback to 50%, entered when up again to 38%

http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/7...12105308am.jpg

Question to HH: When do you put your SL to BE ?

What is the best trailing in your experience ?

When to take profit (target fib or trail after a MA or HA?)

Frenchie,

I think your stop was too tight, because it was on the 50% of fibo, and in the buy zone! In this situation it was better to put the stop to under the buy zone. If you put 10 pip stop, your position still alive!

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Thanks for your comment daftman.

Another question:

In this scenario, would the swing to consider be the one marked with the white line and the buy zone around the white arrow?

Or would the swing to be considered be the 2nd one, marked yellow?

In other words:

Can the swing to be considered be started BEFORE the HA color changes or do we consider the last swing started only after HA changed color ? And we only buy on that last retrace ?

http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/4...01212329pm.jpg

--- 帖子 #782 ---
The ha does not have to change to have a swing on the 1 min in answer to your question, yes the first white line is a great place to start from.

Pay more attention to the indicators in the bottom window, they both have to agree to enter a trade

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Thanks HH,

Hi HH,

three questions in pictures for better understanding....:

http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/4...01293235pm.png

Entry seems according to your instructions. However I wonder if position should be closed right away when it crosses HAMA as in this example

http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7...01294741pm.png

No entry in this move for reasons as in picture ?

http://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1...12102828pm.png

Am I right ?

Harrington,

I see on your picture, the spread of aud/jpy is very large. It's not too good for scalping. I use Alpari.uk MT5 platform for scalping. It's very usefull platform, low spreads, one-click trading, fast executions, no re-quotes. My aud/jpy spread is between 1,2-2,2 pip.

Here is the link:
http://www.alpari.co.uk/en/trading-accounts/ecn.html

I'm not get money from Alpari for advertisement, i share it because i use it too, and i think if you trade on 1 min chart it's better and cheaper to trade here.

Hi!

How to find good entry levels on pullback?

Set two moving average to your chart. Cross of the MA(5) @ open and MA(5) @ close is a good entry level after te pullback. See the attached picture!

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hi draftman,

could not understand on this "Set two moving average to your chart. Cross of the MA(5) @ open and MA(5) @ close is a good entry level after te pullback".

Could you please elaborate on this. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Mohan,

What don't you understand on it? See my picture! The blue line is a simple moving average 5 at price close, the white line is a simple moving average 5 at price open. When this lines cross after the pullback, is a good entry point in the trend direction.

HH,

Ive been using the Heiken_AshiH_sw_mtf on a one minute chart set to 15M.  I have been comparing it with the HAMA.  It seems as if the original Heiken indicator may be a little more accurate, not completely sure yet.  What do you think?  Which one do you prefer?

HH was not connected for several days. Might be on vacation. I hope my many snapshots and questions did not bore him off...

Personally I get the concept, but still with lose ends....

First experience: On M1 I get bad entries through requotes. I might try with an EA line trader to be able to place a Pending Order instead of market. Or go on e.g. M5.

Me too. i encounter more  loses. If this thread is active,we can exchange our ideas and correct our mistakes.

take care!

--- 帖子 #808 ---
i used to scalp alot on the 1 minute timeframe, its easy, but the dangerous thing is the sudden market plunge or spike. Therefore, i think minute 5 entry is better since then.

Now i look at minute 30 and 15 for observation during Europe hours. 1 minute timeframe must goes with a good timer, i saw an ea expert that closes all trade within 1 minute regardless of win or losses, but his entry is quite good. he made 1 million from initial $2000.00 deposit.

Take a look at this picture.

I am using 2 mtf heikens and a bbmacd in the lower window.

After watching for a few hours you should be able to spot the entries

You can use a line trader ea for entries, works really well

Just draw the trendlines and wait for the line trader to trigger your entry.

Hello HH,

retrospectively the entries are easy to see. While they generate, it is not so easy J

Have a look at my snapshots below from a couple of minutes ago. I would like to understand when you actually put the trendline for the line-trader on the chart and activate it.

http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4...12113910am.jpg

Pic 1: all indicators red, price already on the MA8.

Pic 2: I put a trendline “on the back” of the red HAMA. But I entered basically “on anticipation”, not on the fact both indicators agreed. Only when the line was already broken by price,  one of the MTF HAMAs started showing  some green.

Pic 3: HAMA turns blue, deal actually turned out +25 pips for me J

Can you explain a bit more on how you are timing the entry, especially at what moment do you put the trendline with regards to the behavior of the MTF HAMAs that should agree?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #826 ---
YW Mohan, for those of you who dont know how to use the line trader.

From the navigator, drag the ea onto the chart you have open.

In the inputs make the colors that you like for trend lines.

There are 4 commands

BA buy above (Name trendline BA to buy above trendline)

BB buy below (Name trendline BB to buy below trendline)

SA sell above (Name trendline SA to sell above trendline)

SB sell below (Name trendline SB to sell below trendline)

The trendlines have to be same color as in the EA

Make your on complete color different color (trend line changes to that color when order executed.)

HH

--- 帖子 #827 ---
In the bottom window the indicators are mtf heiken ashi, not HAMA's

If you want to have safe trades just use the 15 min ha and only trade the 1 min in that direction.  I agree that the signals are hard to see, but take some time you will get used to it.  Use a line chart for a while rather than candles and you can see the moves much easier.

Hi HH,

Thanks for closely teach me. BTW, i could not see the trend line even i activated the EA...any reason?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hi Mohan, the trendlines will not appear by the EA. The line trader is called line trader because it allows you to trade from a trendline that yourself draw onto the chart.

Draw a trendline as you see on the examples. Then for a buy stop, call it BA (for buy above) and make it blue.  When the EA runs, you will see in upper left corner at what price the current buy stop is.

Hope this helps,

Hi,

my problem: it looks picture perfect and its easy to find entries when you look at a chart.

But try it realtime as price moves.

I give you two examples:

Pic on the left, the line chart did not cross the line trader trendline.

However, when you take the candle chart you see that there was a spike trough and position would have been filled already.

So, retrospectively, with the linechart you do not see how many false entries one would have had.

http://img803.imageshack.us/img803/6...01284844am.jpg

On this picture you see how the indicator can "trick" you.

http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/1...01285001am.jpg

On the left it was green and you would not have taken a trendline trade down. Then the price moves down and suddnely the indicator repaints as well to red.   Looking at a past data chart, it would be again a picture perfect trade short, right?

Maybe HH can clarify. As said in my earlier post, I would really like to see how a trade is decided and at what exact moment a trendline trade is placed with the limitation of the above "issues".

Maybe you could post some snaphots showing the timeline and your thinking as a trade develops.

This is probably of great help for us trying to use HH´s system.

Cheers

HH,

Assuming I enter a long based on your rules  a three ball below 15 min red uptrend HA correct stochastics points up and macd complete cross I take the trade for 6 pips. ( no greed here) however after retrace get the retrace net ball is there a suggested pips above the ma or just trse the retrace in the same direction assuming 15 HA still intact. I seemed to do ok today just going back as soon as the ball pops ...... But perhaps just lucky in an uptrend sins are often forgiven.

Hello all

First of all this is not a negative post.

The only saving grace of this method is that the stop loss is based on the 1min tf and the profit level is targeted on the higher timeframe.

However, it will take far more discipline and concentration for most to bear. Did I mention the utter boredom of constantly taking trades?

Taking (waiting) trades on 1min tf for profit level to be taken on 15min or 1hr is the same principal as taking trades on 4hr tf and taking profit levels on daily or weekly.

I have literally rubbed shoulders with many giants in the industry. And almost all established traders that I have come across in real life aim to take less trades but increase the holding time. Because that's where the greatest edge lies with currency trading. Keep the principal but higher timeframe. Try it.

Within my circle of investors in real life, we are busy maybe 4-5 months of the year and rest is spent waiting for the position/s to fully mature.

HH indicates that the strategy can be extended. His idea is to turn a 1 minute trade into a 15 minute trade. For me this process

Had I believed my eyes instead of reading my forums I would have had a 1 minute trade turn into a 2 hour trade.

This forum has many threads find one that suits you and contribute to it.

HH began with a clear explanation of what it was and was not. He clearly indicates that his goal is to extend a short trade into a longer term one. What he has explains makes sense to me. I am always amazed when someone begins with " this is not a negative post"

I judge things based on the time ther person has devoted to the effort HH has done alot in my opinion Moreover he has asked nothing except that we refrain from questions until we have read the thread.

I know this works for me .... so again I say thanks HH

--- 帖子 #878 ---
When I first read the bio of HH, I was impressed that anyone would offer to share his knowledge with details of the process and the admonition to be a student before a trader.......... I have always believed that a man's value is what he does for others rather than what he does for himself. For those who have not rubbed shoulders with the greats........ I can tell you they are not here offerring their guidance to us for free..... so

I totally believe that "anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first The work takes time and effort to do it well."

Hello Turtle Man,

I really am getting the short side of the stick with this forum.

If you were upset or took offence at my contribution please allow me to apologize first.

I was only expressing what I have experienced in my trading career which I think could be food for thoughts for the followers of this method. What I mentioned before may mean something or it may not. But we are here to discuss are we not? Btw, I have read the first post and many subsequent pages before I started typing my first post.

I'm glad whatever you found here works for you and I hope it continues to.

I have also found what works for myself. For that knowledge, I had to rub shoulders with some of the best but egotistical people in international banking.

And as I said before the principal of this method is ok but could be better. Source: I have conducted several hundred risk/trade models over 10-15 years of past market data. Given the benefit of the doubt wouldn't you also be interested in the work of another man?

I too am showing my trading account in my profile.

Before you or anyone else start to feel territorial about my presence here, I will now retreat.

All professionals should hold mutual respect for one another.

All the best.

This one minute sytem suits my personality well. I always begin my day asking for only what I need Giving thanks for all that I already have  Thanks HH If there is more given I will share with others Now I cashed out all of my demo accounts based on my trading rules that say 1%  per trade or first sign of redbut for all those who say  the minute charts are too hard to trade her is a 40 pip trade in about 5 minutes
Please examine my demo accounts

The issues  for me Better understanding the MACD convergence divergence. I am unwilling to go in the opposite direction but HH says that should be latter in your learning process. Patience Thanks to TOM SPIN   Halkins  and all the others who are walking with me as I leasrn to do this

--- 帖子 #884 ---
I did not trade as I was paying some bills this but it was there.......

30 pips.

Look at the retracement from the three on top

Trade the last three ball on bottom wait 5 pips

MACD

Stoch points up and the 15 says yes

none taken Lex, and I applaud your trading method.  I started trading the daily timeframe, and probably every new trader should start somewhere up there.

Its the same no matter where you trade, 1 min or monthly. You can build a position on the 1 minute and stay with the trade for days or weeks.  It just depends on how long you wish to hold a trade.

I frequently enter several positions on the 1 min chart in the direction of the 4 hour charts and leave them on until they hit tp levels.

This thread was started to show people how easy it is to spot trends using a few simple indicators and finding which side of the market to trade on. I never implied that trading is easy, but I must say its simple once you become a trader.

Within your circle of investors do you offer your trading methods for free?

--- 帖子 #886 ---
The trade presents itself with a real possibliity to have some downward legs. The last 15 minute cnadle shows real disagreement with buyser and sellers so be nimble is my advice. Looks like support is evident at 1.2250 but if it breaks through 1.2220 is doable.

Just follwo the 3 Ball The  second one from the 100  fibo is in control of my trade one above is in control of this trade

--- 帖子 #887 ---
hi turtle man,

doesnt look like you actually use harrington's method fully. why and what are the improvements you think you have made and with what indicators and what settings?

thanks

Actually I think I am however I am new to MT4 and can't get some of the EA files to compile but I am reading and learning

but if I read his system correctly

all I need arethe ZZ semafor which is installed HA which is installed and Stochastics 4 Ability to count 5 below or five below and willingness to allow stops based on percieved daily bias I do calculate supply demand zones based on Seiden so if I see one I can be aware

There is a fresh zone at 1.2286 to 1.2276 but there are also a significant number of bulls so this level is a bit tricky but I am convinced that only with time and actual babtism under fire does one im prove.

Now I have a three ball at 1.22but the 15 minute ha is read wrong direction so I wait Just got a 2 and a 1 on top but the top 3 is a long distacne away so I wait . I am fascinated with some of he long runs I have made with the 1 minute system

Just went short at 1.22754 with 4 pips against me SL is 20 pips as I have negative bias

5:11  8/01/2012  NYC time Results of Trade # 2 The results are less than exciting and are shown in my explorers. Took small losses in each account.

Hello Lex

i have just read your reply and it appears that you are a professional.

i looked in your mailings and you dont seem to have been welcomed very openly

why not open your own thread and show us how you do it.

that is probably the best way to encourage discussions and mutual respect.

i also looked at your current trades and they look good.

I will keep my eyes peeled for your thread.

Happy trading.

Hello

HH

I am using your system in 4 digit broker but I got 2 times 3 ball in one side. Is this is happen or my setting is wrong. Please explain.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Hi

You can use this indicator to understand trend and its really good for scalping.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
This strategy uses MTF inidcators, HA and MACD.  When looking at historical data, it looks great when you look at a five minute MTG chart on a 1M chart.  Beware, you just can't use the MTF indicator data with no awareness of what bars can actually be used.  As an example on a 1M chart with a 5M MTF, you should identify the 1 min bar you are interested in.  Then you have to go back 5 bars on the MTF indi to get the actual valid MTF data bar.  Why?? You have to take into account that the 5M bar has to complete before you can use the data.  In real time, this problem solves itself, since the most recent MTF bars will be the bar value as it develops - typically not really useful until it completes its formation.

Just so ya know - realtime will not be the same as historical when using MTF.  I have my own method of generating MTF so that I can use them in backtesting.

Hello

I use this system but little bit confuse some time in my brokers MT4 I saw 2 or more time 3 ball under or upper side. Any way I got good result with this.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Hi, so you enter on 3-balls?  That is risky. The reason you see several 3-balls is basically because they "repaint".  The 3 ball shows e.g. a low..... price moves up a bit,,,, then down, creating a lower low, then 3-ball will be there again.

Cheers,

Hey folks, all of the things you are saying about the indicators are true.

Trading is a learned profession, and you cant take a few indicators put them on a chart and become successful trading.  You must learn how to read charts, trends, counter trends, fib levels, etc etc etc.

price action, how price reacts around support and resistance, then you can take a few indicators and become a trader.  mtf indicators are useful tools in trading if you can learn how to read them.

Have fun hh

--- 帖子 #905 ---
HH,

I think some of these younger traders are looking for the magic wand. Unless you understand those things mentioned below you are not going to feel success. I think the reason it worked so quickly for me is the pain I went through as it allowed me to visually see my previous mistakes ..... I remain fascinated that a one minute chart can yield a 100 pip trade if you are willing to accept the fib retrace nets that are sometime I excess of z100 %  but heck I stay now with my original stop loss so I have had some monster trades. For me at least !

I still have things to learn about your process but heck I am sold adding on rooms

Hh

Thanks if I old I would vouch for you. You are the real deal

--- 帖子 #906 ---
This is a trade that could have been..... I teach school wso now I have to set  and forget You can see the order not filled had i been here  .... but another 100 plus pips from 1 one min chart

Or can you please explain.

Fibonacci drawn from first three bal another drn from each subsequent three

--- 帖子 #910 ---
I find that I can get guidance for remaining in a trade from the Fibonacci lines

I draw the first from three ball to the first op up of another opposite side  then I wait to see if retracement follows Fibonacci sequence sheen another three pops up on the side I took the trade I drawn in again at next three

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Hi turtleman,

HH indicates that the process works in any time frame. To extend from 1 minute you must know the compression and retracement tendencies. HH says we should shoot for 10 pips. My goal is 100 pips. Seems to work for me. I am not sure where to start as all I did was follow his process and add what I could see to magnify that process.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Hi again, ok, but it does not explain on which criteria you are entering.  Can you explain that please? It is not visible from your charts you post.

Hi

Can you explain it. What exactly you want to us? 2min chart is better than 1min.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Hh tells us that entry is based on

1.same color bar next largest time frame

2. Macd cross

3.stichastics turned up

4. 5 pips beyond 9 min moving average

Ride trade till you see three on opposite side of line

5. Only trade with trend until you get the feel as the reversals are well a bit tricky

I take off 1/2 position and ride the rest to 100 pips done this three times in last 17 days this works

I am convinced that moving to 5 and 15 gets even longer trades

And 15 30 even better ones

Have you thanked hh yet...... If you can vouch please do

Hello Turtle Man!

Would you be so kind and post your template and indicators? There have been so many variations to this method that I am no longer sure what is what!

Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #920 ---
No I am not going to tamper with the instruction given in the thread  by hh read each post by haaington its his gift. read and do as he said and all will come together for you. there is no silver bullet but his process works reaaly well

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hi Turtle Man,

you do not tamper with HH´s system if you show us a snapshot of an entry you took.

Comments/questions:

1.same color bar next largest time frame

I guess you mean the last FINALIZED HAMA candle as the current would still be "work in progress" and subject to change.

2. Macd cross

3.stichastics turned up
2. and 3. was never a part of the system. HH suggested to freely chose one or several indicators you believe in. So nothing to tamper here :-)

4. 5 pips beyond 9 min moving average
Why 9 and not the MA8 suggested by HH? Do the 5 pips have to break through in one candle?

Ride trade till you see three on opposite side of line
Line means MA9?

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #922 ---
In the few times I have posted I have consistently referred this threads' participants to the orginator HH

I respond to kindness not attitude

I have posted setups in my trade journal here in FF

--- 帖子 #924 ---
What´s your problem Turtle Man?

Several people ask your to simply show us one of your entries for discussion.

What is wrong with that?

This is a forum for discussion..... so you should be open for people wanting to discuss and not react with rejection to such questions. Especially if you have some success applying HH´s system.

Good for you that you apparentely do great. Now, share it and help others to understand....Pointing out to read it again does not help me and others. I think we all read and try.....  if you have a problem with that I am not cheering you anymore neither :-)

--- 帖子 #925 ---
I must agree with Frenchie, not because i am Swiss though

Turtle Man, there really are quite a few variations of HH's system here. HH unfortunately does not show us anymore what his screen/template looks like, and you also refuse.

I wonder what people achieve by telling everyone ''You see I am sooo successful but I will not tell you how''...is it some form of 'Schadenfreude' (fun at the expense of others)?

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi guys,

I show you some good entry levels from the past two hours.

The green vertical lines is the long entries, and the one red vertical line is the short entry.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
there are 6 trades with set up and explanation in my trading journal. Hope this finalizes this issue. I remain far from the success that I know will come as I pay my dues with work mistakes countless demo failures and following the guidance of those who offer it without asking that their guidance be spoon fed me. I read 25 different threads here with great guidance from each. I green what I can and then claim the knowledge as a gift undeserved but preferred by those I deem having something or things I am lacking,

At times it's an indicator Others a system A reminder A clarification

What I do not do is ask for more than is given freely and certainly without fully understanding to the best of my ability the gifts proferred . In the case of your observation that the thread is cluttered ... So what follow hh posts and avoid any and all clutter. That's what I did .... As soon as I was ready to use it cash money and demo I set up my thread in the trading journals section and offered six trades....  If I have modified his initial information so be it ... I am not that clever to deceive or even with the will to do so. I have learned from experience the things acquired without cost are valueless. hh gave me a gift I have over 60 hours and 42 trades invested in understanding his gift and here me her making it mine. Perhaps If I were so confident in my mods I would share them but... Since I am willing to make mistakes to learn I do not choose to share those possible errors with the public. The trade thread is real and posted as the trades developed...  That's it for me.....  You might want to look up Peter Crowns  a real pro who last posted here in 2010 after sharing another truly wonderful gift. He left after a rant...... That is more than specific to address this issue. There are some awesome people and traders here but they are not seeking us......and owe us nothing.... So before. You somehow conclude anyone owes you anything jus because you ask.... Think again.... And if you need again. I have posted a link to my trade journal thread...... I will not address the issue again .

Thanks HH it was clear to me......

--- 帖子 #928 ---
daftman, thanks for your snapshot!

What was the reason you flagged the short trade (red vertical line)? The higher TF Hama was blue still.

Other than that I understand all your entries :-)

It seems that the long entry on cross of MA8 is quite similar to putting a trendline on the back of the descending HAs, right? (To basically use automated entry via line trader which gives a better entry price).

Cheers,

Dirk

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Not sure why you choose to address me as daft man but

A clarification

What I do not do is ask . I have posted a link to my trade journal thread...... I will not address the issue again .

--- 帖子 #930 ---
I adressed and thanked daftman. Not you ! Read the post (#927) above yours. Daftman kindly showed us valid entries on a chart of yesterday.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
I use the higher tf Hama only for secondary confirmation, because it can repaint the last session when trend change. My first trend change signal is when the price cross the EMA48 and the RSI cross the 50 line in same time. Yes, you are right, the MA8 is looks like the HAS. I don't use line trader, because i open position only on candle close.

--- 帖子 #932 ---

i  found the thread. i agree entirely with your views small time frames begin it all.

i must say first i have just been barred from a room as i believe the owner of it doesnt like pro traders or at least someone with their own views, and he has lost people a lot of money. I am still learning different trading ways and seek new information hence me visiting rooms. I trade e/u a/u g/u and my friend put me onto OIL, oil in my opinion is great due to the big swings so hopefully i will post a few charts and my trades and as always ,,,i keep it very simple, take care everyone

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Which room ."...   This one is championed by the work explained in detail at the top of the thread HH has a rather unique approach that can allow a 1 min set up to become 100 pip trade. There are good people here welcome. Recall god gave each of us two ears 1 mouth the ratio works listen and think 2times more than you write

--- 帖子 #940 ---
thanks for the welcome, Every time frame has its merits ie monthly daily down to 1 min. every river starts off with a rain drop in the mountains, every market moves from a tick, the 1 minute time frame is n excellent time frame to be on. i must say i normally trade 2 min and 15 min. i will stick a chart in and show .

Turtla Man,

I don't understand your EU longs. HH's system based on to enter short in the M15 trend direction when M1 pullbacks.

But you open positions against the M15 trend. Why don't you post positions which based on HH's system?

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Daftman,

Good Question. There is no black box or silver bullet at least that is what most of the traders I know tell me..... HH offerred a process. I show you that I jumped the trades ...... That based on somethings that I believe and risk I am willing to take that are not worthy of saying that they work.

They work for me as you can tell today

I am at school today but I will post the screen shot later today but you can see I am still in the trades

1.24995 32 pips

1.25000 32 pips

1.2508 23 pips that is the trade I jumped

I did not sell at the 2550 on the chart as I now believe the road to higher is now paved with Euro Pips.

In fact I added another piece at 1.2567

I am not just using HH's system as he suggests that we use additional supports

That is what I have been trying to tell this thread. I am not confident enough to say this or that works. I can only show what works for me. We all have stuff to deal with risk management.

I work with very wide stops and smaller size as I am not able to draw supply zones as well as I should now.

If I were able to play in size with positions I would be making much more

I just was able to post my explorer again For some reason when my broker changes servers it messes up TE.

I have a duplicate real account for every explorer I will post. I manage my larger accounts very much more conservatively than the ones that are swinging for fences. The demo account that is posted as TE is typical since I found HH freebie. I would expect to earn about 5 to 7% monthly

I cannot have them as a TE as I trade with Trade Station USA. and Trade Station is currently not supported.

I have blown up accounts

1. From 5 K to 13 K back to 3 K Lessons learned

2. From 5 k to 21 K back to 6K Lessons learned

3. Now I am ready to rock

I have learned:

leverage of 1 to 5 1 to 6 max.

Do not close daily positions ......have confidence in your positions.

I am learning and hope to perfect

asking, challenging, displaying trades, discussing on scenarios (potential setups, winners and losers).

If this is about one presents a strategy,  no questions are allowed but  then a few show their "I make great trades but I won´t help you to do the same", that is not my understanding of this forum.

The world is filled with those who do and those who complain .

Some accept the given given and build on it through trial and error.

No one owes another anything

But choses with whom they shared much

HH shared a system in a manner that is in my opinion clear concise and very successful.

But depending a person's level of capability and eagerness to work to understand success varies.

I teach HS math and I am ranked thankful among the accomplished distinguished teachers in my state. I spend the first 3 weeks or so helping students understand that its their work and effort that causes success.

I'm having a problem with the balls on the semaphor. Basically I get something like, "  [], l, [l],"   I'm assuming [l], would be the the indicator mark that normally would be the 3 ball?

Anyone know how I can fix this?  What am I missing fonts or something?

I don't really need the, "3," marker do I?   It's just counting that there are three of the indicator marks above or below when the other indicators line up, right?

For anyone trading daily open lines the GU gave up 40 + pips from the London Open. Put those daily open lines on the charts and watch the price action around them religiously,,,,5pm, 8pm, midnight if you wish, 2 am, 3am, and of course 8am New York.

For those of you who live in other areas the daily open line times start at 5 pm EST times.

I get more trade setups around those times than any other times during the 24 hour trading period

The trading day starts at 5pm and runs 24 hrs every day  sun 5pm thru fri 5 pm

Hi HH,

thanks for your sharing about the fib template. Unfortunately, when i load the template, i could not see anything about the fibo. Could you please help me again how to setup?

Thanks

Hi Turtle man,

Sorry if my words hurts your feeling. Some time, when i loss my reall money, i act like that. Sorry buddy.

BTW, could you please help me how to setup the fibo template shared by HH? If possible, please help to summarize about the whole system.

Thanks a lot ya! happy trading!

A simple excercise on the 1 min charts using a 5 min indicator. For those of you who want higher percentage trades use a 15 min HAMA rather than a 5, or heck use both and when they both agree trade in that direction....

Use your heads not your heart to trade.

Here is the mtf indicator.

It also has an alert that lets you know when the HAMA changes direction so you can run it on many pairs to look for setups

It is not a system to trade, it is a method to be learned to determine the direction to trade in.  If you read the thread and become familiar with trends, and what indicators point you in the proper direction, you can learn to trade.

If you are looking for someone to hold your hand and teach you how to trade this is not the place to come.

Mohan Please deeply consider http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/system.html

data driven attack

System Definitions (2)

1. A set of detailedmethods, procedures, and routines established or formulated to carry out a specific activity, perform a duty, or solve a problem.

2. An organized, purposeful structure regarded as a whole and consisting of interrelated and interdependent elements (components, entities, factors, members, parts etc.). These elements continually influence one another (directly or indirectly) to maintain their activity and the existence of the system, in order to achieve the goal of the system.

All systems have (a) inputs, outputs, and feedbackmechanisms, (b) maintain an internal steady-state (called homeostasis) despite a changing external environment, (c) display properties that are peculiar to the whole (called emergent properties) but are not possessed by any of the individual elements, and (d) have boundaries that are usually defined by the system observer. Systems underlie every phenomenon, and are everywhere one looks for them. They are limited only by the observer’s capacity to comprehend the complexity of the observed entity, item or phenomenon. Every system is a part of a larger system, is composed of subsystems, and shares common properties with other systems that help in transferring understanding and solutions from one system to another. Systems obey rules that cannot be understood by breaking them into parts, and stop functioning (or malfunction) when an element is removed or altered significantly. Together, they provide a coherent and unified way of viewing and interpreting the universe as a meta-system of interlinked wholes, and of organizing our thoughts about the world.

Although different types of systems (from a cell to the human body, soap bubbles to galaxies, ant colonies to nations) look so very different on the surface, they have remarkable similarities. At the most basic level, the

For everyone to ponder for a few moments.

Only trade long on an up day, and only trade short on a down day.

Take a look at a 1 hr chart and see if you can figure out if its an up day or a down day.

If you can not determine if its an up day or a down day then you should not be trading.

I have read only half of the thread (several times though, as I want to make sure I get everything right), and my question is this (I have not seen it covered): the MA in colour comes by default at 12, yet the rules invariably speak of EMA 8 - do I take it right that the default setting of 12 should be changed to 8, or left as is since the MA8 in one of the templates posted is linear weighted rather than simple or exponential?

suggestion also learn some 15min price action system.. it will help up to take more order in same direction(with trend) and ranging(non trend) .... as earlier suggestion by HH please watching price action on 15min with Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed for few days.

hi hh

i have tried a long time to find a good system that is really working and as same time easy to understand.i went through so many of them here in FF.

none of them really worked untill i found this one here.its a great setup and simple.

thanks alot HH

regards

fred

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
kudos to HH for bring in the finest system of FF for trading the dreaded 1 m and make it such a cake walk. I have been tracking this thread for quite sometime and although initially i was not getting the grips of it , was finally able to get the grips with the HHlatest zip file template. I now start trading at each market open  like london open , NY open and things are pretty easy trading the opens.

one thing that always is confusing is the HAMA settings as it keeps changing , HH request u to clarify the settings and keep it fixed like now we have the 3 2 1 earlier it was 10 2 1 .

we just need to finalise on this on the 1 M and 15 M time frame.

I specially like the 5 m and 15 m matching to strike down on the 1 m time frame .

I would like to suggest that for SL u can use the 50 ema high value for sell and 50 ema low for buy value it really works .( just to get the sl value )

I think HH should have been vouched a lot of times for bringing us such a wonderful system .

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Hi & thanks for updating us with your latest templates. May I ask why you introduced additional indicators into the price window. How do you put them in relation to relying on the  higher timeframe HAMA indicating the direction and using favorite Fib retracements for entries?

Can you post some screenshots of trades from recent days?

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Food for thought, simple template to trade 1 m and 15 m ,

first find the trend ( 200 ema cutting 50 ema ) then wait for the same direction arrow to back your trade with sl above the band .

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Which indicators are you using? within your template has anyone not knowing this strategy would just have the MA bands on there screen.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
hama, ema cross  bbmact and stoch 15 5 5 . I have tried to make it simple .

what is a trend ?

only when the 50 band cuts the 200 band will signify a trend change . a arrow will come up in screen to tell that .

then we have smaller trend which is defined by the break of 50 ema band , another arrow comes up to tell the direction .

so entry rules , first check the major trend, if it is buy ? then look for all arrow in buy direction and exit your trade when you get an arrow in the opposite direction .

suppose u have major trend a buy then take all buy arrow trades and exit when u get the sell arrow . so since u move along the trend u will have greater chance to win. HAMA should agree.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Hi Unimak,

1 min template looks like this, but not getting arrow is it OK?

yes it is fine , arrow is not coming as u have not put ema cross indicator, google for it.

Idk, so this is why I'm asking. Is there anyone who will try to code it as an EA ?

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Thanks Unimak. I have a question regarding the daily open lines you have in the template. The input 10 and 15 are offsets which vary depending on the broker? Do I need to change it to match my broker time?

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
Thanks for a nice, clean strategy, Unimak.  In appreciation, I modified your HA file and your MTF Stoch file to use relative indexing for the timeframe specification instead of an absolute TF.  Instead of entering the TF in the parameter box, you enter the relative index to the TF you want to use.  0 = current TF, 1 = 1 TF higher, 2 = 2TF higher, etc.  This allows you to go from one chart TF to another, keeping the same structure.  So, your two templates become one template.  When trading, you can enter a trade on the 1m TF and switch to 5m or 15m TF and see how the trend looks there.  You might choose to stay in the trade longer by exiting on the 15m instead of the 1m.

You will see the extension "ri" on the file names attached, meaning "relative index".

Good trading, Unimak.

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
thanks for the effort and the input. nice work

The daily open lines need to be adjusted to reflect USA times.  Most brokers have different times so you will have to figure out for yourself which times equal the London Open, Asia Open, 5 pm est Open, and the New York Open.

Hi all, I do hope that this thread is still active, as I have learned so much from it. I still find it difficult to determine when to get out of a trade.

No erfan_hi I did not say that I am losing money. I do end up with approximately between 50 and 100 pips per day. This system has increased my pips per day by approximately 20 to 40 pips. All I am saying is that I could make much more if I can reduce my losing trades.

Mr Hharrington,would like to thank you for this post. It is a good strategy.  It helped me a lot when I am scalping.

I still would use both candles Heiken Ashi Smoothed and regular on one minute chart an add more Moving  Averages, Round number lines and watch ADR lines.  EMA 200 and EMA 365 are very strong resistance on 1 or 5 min charts. A lot of times price changes direction when it bumps into 200 EMA - 365 EMA.

I included links to your post on my blog.

EasyRyder,

Thank you for indicators,

Sorry but I going to have to call BS on this. Has nobody noticed the op despite being a trader for 10 years is still using a DEMO account?

There is a reason for this. Scalping for 5 or so pips is NOT possible on a retail forex account. You'll make money initially and then one day the slippage will come. Seriously people save yourself a lot of time and stay away from scalping, brokers can easily kill scalpers by introducing slippage on profitable traders. Google virtual dealer plugin and you'll see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
I read about the virtual dealer plugin, I can see your point, but what are your thoughts if you ask your broker about the slippage policy and they say there's

no slippage on the account you have?

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
leerees i am sure you have't read this system too, this system give you an early entry on time frame 1min with direction of 15min Heiken ashi and 5min trend confirmation and FIB support, and upon 1min trend get stronger you can see the same trend on 1h and 4h, keep your trade until trend is not over.

i am sure you will make more than 300pips on eurjpy, usdjpy,gbpjpy

i know everybody cannot trade on 1min time frame due to our own limitations, if so you might be move to higher time frame 15min, 30min, 1H or 4H.

daily markets moves approx 100, and max 300 or you can say uncertain 500 pips including bigggg news etc, but market never change its weekly trend or monthly trend its easily..

trade on 15min time frame with 30 trend direction with confirmation 60min trend,

trade on 30min time frame with 60 trend direction with confirmation 240min trend,

trade on 60min time frame with 240 trend direction with confirmation 1440min trend ,

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
I am not even going to respond to this.

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
leerees, without trying, without knowing, if you saying this system is BS(bullshit), then please do simple thing.. go to hell!

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Yes You have to be very careful, when scalping...  Use broker, who allows scalping.

This system helps to enter trades, no difference what time frame you use. 1 min scalp may develop into 15 min or 1 hour trade, if you have patience. Some of us just can not wait 3 or 5 days at Daily Resistance level and hope, that trade will go to right direction. ... And fake break out on daily chart will take away all your profits...... guess it depends from personality. ... and from your account size too...

Daily open lines are very important.  If your broker is at USA Easter time settings will be:

Time Zone of data setting

Sydney open:  -7

London open: 3

NY open:  8

I posted some tips from my experience, how to trade Daily open line squeeze. It usually happens before big news or when price is coming to Daily resistance or support level.   Daily open lines are also strong S/R levels. They may be reversal points, when market is slow.
Do not scalp, when you have small distance between those lines.  Then this method will be big looser...

Good job HH.

I've been using thesec concepts to trade binary options 60s and has been amazing how it can work.

I've used almos any imaginable tool and EA around to try to trade and finally I guess I have an edge on market.

Again, good job

Hi HH , after reading this thread I'm still trying with your method .

I think I'll go with 5 minutes 1st instead of 1 minute .

I tried using your indicators and template which you used on 1 minute into a 5 minutes chart . And I compare with it with all your screenshot , it seems like the indicator on 5 minutes need to tune a bit . What do you think as I would like to know your opinion .

Also thanks a lot for sharing your precious method . I really appreciate it !

Hi hharrington,

In terms of Fx in 2013 I just started learning, and your teaching was very inspiring to me. Thank you! Intend to apply it in 2014 and will see how it goes.

Hope you are thinking to post again - I am sure many people would be very happy about it, I surely will.

Wish you a wonderful prosperous year in 2014!

Hey folks,

Hope y'all had a successful 2013.

2014 has started off with very nice trading.

I am going to put a final template in here with the indicators.  Just 2 indicators, a 3 level semafor and a HAMA mtf indicator.

I have reduced the chart to its simplest form and this is what works best.

This will be my final entry for you traders, and want to be traders because it is the simplest form of trading that i have found to be the best.

Trade the pairs with the highest atr/adr and you will have higher reward trades.

Thanks for watching this thread over the years, and God Bless and good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Here are the setups,

I am sure you can find the indicators if they are not here.

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
HH, thanks for the latest screenshots.  Been trading 1m with your basic strategy for some time now.  Can you post a template, and any indis that we do not have.  I think we have them all, but the template will not work if any of the names are different from our indicator folder.  I like your color scheme, and that will come with the template.  Hard to get the colors so that one can see everything when they overlay.

Thanks for one of the better threads and strategies on FF.

Best of luck to you.

George

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Thank you HH, will put it into use.

"This will be my final entry for you traders".. - there is a saying: "never say never"  Maybe you'll still drop a line or two from time to time still, it will be very nice to hear from you

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
It is nice to hear from you. Hope you well.

It is also 15 min Hama can be used on 1 min chart. For those who familiar with Ichimoku can use also Ichimoku clouds. Note that Hama alert sometimes will give false signals.

Few things are important here:

1. To identify squeezes (Which you do with Day open lines) , but that can be done adding Bollinger bands

2. To know where Pivots and round numbers are very important. The price moves from one pivot to the other, that gives direction on 1 min chart

3. Bumping into 20, 50, 200, 360 moving averages - strong resistance on 1 min chart (......but that would be different strategy)

I would not scalp without one moving average on chart. 20 EMA crossing - its a signal that direction may be changing on 1 min. Watch how Moving average changing direction. Hama will not give that visually.

4. Fundamentals - Pay attention when News are announced

5. Support and resistance on higher time frames

5. Confluence of different factors, that trader needs to know,

It is all important when scalping

6. To know what daily average range is for particular pair you trading

PS. The balls are very confusing, i would not use it for trading. I traded much better when i removed it from chart, watched moving average cross for short term trend change and pivots for resistance support.

To identify small swings better to use FIB extensions from last swing.

I am writing this as message for beginning traders. It will be not be easy to scalp on 1 min.  You have to know what happens one higher time frames.

Good luck to you !

Hi,

Watching his last screenshots. What is the indicator showing prevous day's high/low, daily pivot?

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
The Thrill to make 10 pips in 10 mins has always enticed me, while I have been able to do well in higher timeframes but it was kind of boring after a period of time . As i was searching and researching about this 1 m game, lot of ppl said it has lot of noise etc etc all negative comments, i came across 2 trading systems which were very refreshing and very re assuring , one is this thread and the author is a very good friend of mine and the other one i forgot the name but it was based on fibo and bollinger bands. while both the threads answered my thoughts to some extent it never gave a 100 % assurance so at the back of my mind i had this nagging doubt even it is 1 % what will happen if it does not work out etc. As i researched i came up with a very simple indicator as simplicity was very prime requirement . so here i am attaching the pic . Trading is like water now . have a look .

All one has to do is once the signal arrives , take the trade in the mentioned direction of the trade and keep minimum sl or keep sl just above the signal line and trade the price and keep booking profits. skype id : unimak12

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Unimak, hope you are trading well.  Would you mind sharing your parameters for the HA T3 please?

Thanks,

George

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
From what I can see as I set this up on the 1M chart the HA T3 settings are  Timeframe 30minutes  than,  3,2,1,false, rest is default....

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
I have not changed the settings , it is the same 3 2 1

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
A word of thanks for your simply amazing system.

When I first saw the heading of the thread I was attracted by the 1 minute time frame which has become my favorite time frame, then I said freebie might mean "he's gonna sell something soon"but I was wrong.

Going thru the thread I'm grateful I thew my skepticism away because right away I found something I'd been thinking of but never bothered to Google, that is a  multi time frame HA indicator.

I have applied both the Smoothed and the T3 MA HA indies and blended it into a something that makes sense to me.

For now this is the easiest way to trade for me.

Thanks once more HH

Hi Intrepidpips   , Kindly share your Indicator and Templete, Thank You ...

Intrepidpips   Please share your indicators and templates.

It is much appreciated.

Bobby R

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
That's what we are here for sharing and caring.

Please note that I've not tested any of the indie on Build 600 so be cautious.

I also noticed that you may not catch the exact bottom or tops with the MTF HAMA template in real-time but the subsequent swing highs or lows will serve as entry to continue with a move in progress.

The other template -mtf Stoch HA is a "freebie" WIP" (work in progress) an attempt to catch the tops and bottoms of the M15 Stoch swings.

Experiment and adjust the settings to your taste, I'm still tweaking myself.

Enjoy

Distracted, a likely story?

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
Thank you for sharing indicators.

To catch tops and bottoms you can also use MTF Bollinger Bands.

On 1 min chart you add 1 min 5 min and 15 min Bollinger bands then you see what is happening on higher time frames. If you see confluence of multiple Bollinger bands - that most likely will be top or bottom - that's where is hidden resistance.

That is different method, but can be useful for scalpers.

Example: in this case - flat market on 15 min, that's what you see on 5 min chart, if you ad multiple Bands.

Hi as I can see

actually I'm in profit +20 gbpusd,+11 chfjpy,+23 eurjpy and + 49 gbpjpy (SHORT) with my M5 and M15 methods

banked some nice pips today,and moved SL into the safe zone

no hidden secrets here,I trade pivots and trendlines with a couple of good momentum indicators and moving averages

it has been a good trading day

I post on forums only when I have some free time from trading,it helps me to let the trades run

I'm searching for a good scalping sys M1 TF for the ranging days\periods

and my question for
Intrepidpips,  RabbitWolf ,  hharrington is:

what are your results with M1 trading?

thx

Best Regards

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
I send you message, check your mail, it's not related to 1 min method, I do not want to to mess up this thread

Good Luck !

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
thx bro

I'll give it a shot over the weekend

I currently have 3 methods, for 3 different TFs

Daily

M15

M5

but I'm curious about M1

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
M1 trading is very profitable when you give it two things;

1 consistency,

2 Non repainting indicators.

M1 is the cradle of trading as I see it, cos when a large institutional order gets filled, the first candle of that price movement shows up in the M1 time frame then 5 candles later the M5 candle will close and 3 of that interval later, the M15 candle will close.

It goes to reason that with a solid strategy in M1 you could actually be in on most of the big market moves, the problem comes when you want to catch absolute Tops and Bottoms or when you want to rise a retracement which is not thru yet.

For me I found great results with M5 but I see greater potentials with M1 so I'd keep working on M1 till I find my niche.

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
yes the same here

I feel comfortable with M5 and M15 and D1

M1 is a bit frenzy in my opinion

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
I can't seem to get any of the Heiken_AshiH_sw_mtf indicators to work with my MT4.  Can anyone suggest a reason why?  Does it need another indicator?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
If u r bent upon trading 1 m then dear "the bourne" there is no other system than this one , it is the best system u will ever come across all u need is the hama 2 tf abv with 3 2 1 setting and the semafor indi and stoch 5 3 3 if u prefer not necessary ,

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
What build of mt4 is yours?

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Please post your template and screenshots!

Intrepidpips,

I was missing the regular HA indicator.  Added it and fixed problem.  When does everyone exit their trades?

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
thx for your feedback

I'm still studying this M1 system,maybe it doesn't suit my trading style but I'm an open mind Trader

I read some good variations\templates over the thread,still askin' which one is the best for me

I'm happy to see the original system has been respected anyway

p.s

I can't fall in love with Semafor Indi

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
Did anybody use TMA Slope indicator on 1 min chart ?

I started test it for some time and like how it works for very short scalping. It helps a bit to feel how strong is trend on 1min. Would work with Harringtons method.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

only i would add MACD and MTF Stochastics (5 min 15 min) on top of it. Stochastics has to show 20, 50, 80 levels. Or any other indicator can be stacked on top of it.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
ok  here are the rules, please note these rules are based on the original rules i have just simplied to my understanding without changing the core of the original values.

1. start hunting for oppurtunity to buy or sell 1 hr before asian open london open and us open . rest of the time trading is not profitable and is less efficient

2. take any semafor and MTF HA t3

3. for any tf add 2 tf above in mtf ha that is for 1 m use 15 m

4. as long as the mtf ha does not change color u can trade in the direction of the mtf ha , dnt worry abt the dances of sema . at each of the green ball or yellow ball u can add more positions.

5. trade in GA however u can trade any but ga gives more pips

6. remember for buy entry post the sun the mtf ha should give buy , the closer the better . u can confirm it with mtf stoch 5 3 3 settings for hama use 3 2 1 settings.

that is all the rules . quite simple .

hope things are crystal clear now.

Use it in confluence with other indicators. Before trading on 1 min, check how 1 hour and 4 hour chart looks. Should be in tune with 1 hour.

Good luck !

P.S. It repaints...

If it is MTF, repainting is excusable to some extent, but if it is not then it's a sorry venture.

Dear trueaj,

Please refer to the earlier post.... there got the indicators and templates for 1M & 5M.

BUT...BUT.... my advice to you is.... please slowly read all the post from page 1 until page 60 from all the traders AND pay more attention to HH (hharington sir).

here you got all the info @ from kindergarten to post graduate. apply every single indicators and the methods and you should practice in demo. then only you know how it works. If HH said 1M chart load with Heiken Ashi (HA) indicators at 15M trend and moving average (MA) 8..... enter the trade when price cross the MA 8 > you should do accordingly.... DON'T break the law.....

same goes to 15M chart and trade with different HA setting and method....

That's the reason, you should pay more attention to every words..... you can spend 1 or 2 weeks to understand the methods and practice practice practice.

Happy New Year to everyone....

I have look a lot into the system, the way to define a trend and everything is very good and clever.

The only thing that I was not confident was with the entries, many changes and many different way to enter.

With the template you are using which is the latets one. Do you enter when all the indicators align, I found that many times when all align is too late that is why im asking

Kind regards

Yes, i will wait for the indicators are all align together. most of the times you have to wait for long time and some time while you are waiting, you will miss the earlier opportunity. i'm still in Demo and some times loss the pips/trade.

Just been using MTF stochs for the M5 M15 charts to give me direction.

Could you go into example particuliarly how to use Sl on such time frames, when you "rest is spent waiting for the position/s to fully mature." even on M15 or M30 sometime we see price coming back eat up  all the profits or hit SL then moving again in the trend you were expecting , how are you avoiding that on much higher TF?
