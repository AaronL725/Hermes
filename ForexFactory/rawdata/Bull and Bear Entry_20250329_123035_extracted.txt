HI Aelimian The attached chart where I have drawn the vetical line the candle above EMA 21 High the Bear no was -.06 and you will enter for trade the next candle and in the data window you can see the change in the numbers of bear and bull

Hi Friend Harigp.. Nice to see you here in your thread with your own system.. hope to learn from you ..

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi wed wed Nice to talk with you, Yes wed when the bear no becomes minus .01 onwards you can go for short entry and plus .01 onwards long entry You know the candles should be above EMA 21 high for short and EMA 21 low for long

--- 帖子 #8 ---
i think u mean in short entry bear No. -0.01 or Below.. ( -0.01,-0.02,-0.03.... )

Thanx for clearification

Hi wed wed Thanks You can superimpose the bull and bear indicator as one to get better understanding of the flow of candles

Hello, I was wondering if your system works on other pairs and if you have tried it on a 1Min. chart. By other pairs, I mean the majors like Eur/Usd , Gbp/Usd , Usd/Jpy , Usd/Chf. Seems like a good system! How long have you been using this set up? Thanks for posting....T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Have checked out your posts and system, and can tell you put a lot of time and thought into it. How long have you tested it, and what have been your results? How did you figure it out? I've been thinking about something similar with other pairs using various distances away from a 40 Moving Average, depending on the time frame. As you know, the problem is that the pair will move outside of it's normal boundaries and you never know for how long. I was looking for a way to determine when to make an entry after a pair moved outside that range, and looks like you found a way for the gippy. Good work. Perhaps with the proper plus and minus numbers, this would work on other pairs and time frames as well?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Yes it works on all pairs.It works also in one minute chart but you need fast fingers to get in and get out I was expermenting this system for about two weeks first with only the bull and bear indicator and later only I tried to look into the data window and found that the data window gives more clear picture for entry and exit

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Does it work with the same settings on all pairs? Does look like you have more winners than losers on the gippy, but one drawback is the screen time. Would be nice if someone could make an indi for it.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I did some testing on EU and euro/AUS with the same method It works Belive it or not in my real account I was able to make 85 pip in EU/AUS yesterday If we wish to move forward with the system I prefer to concentrate with one pair and I have choosen GJ because it is my favourate pair and the results are fast.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Great system. Please what SL do you use for GBPJPY? Also if you get a short signal above 21 EMA high, do you stop and reverse if it does not continue to go in your direction? If yes how do you determine that point? Would a new increase in bull above 0.01 be enough to SAR? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi Aelimain Short placed above 21 EMA while the bear number is minus The only thing you have to take care is even if the candle above 21EMA has minus but if it is in consolidation which you can spot when there is gap in the middle of bull and bear indicator better not to trade Stop loss something which is in the process of thinking Attaching chart with some remarks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Just want to be sure I understand the system. Scrolling back, I see a trade at 01:55 that would have netted 10 pips. After that, there were 5 long trades that would have lost. At 08:15, 08:45, 08:55, 09:30 and 09:35. Now it's 19:10, and from 09:35 to now, there were no other viable trades, meaning 10 hours without any entries. If I understand the instructions correctly, this would sure seem to be a lot of chart watching.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi parado I will look into those times you have mentioned in the chart. Regarding chart watching I think one strong move either uk or us session is enough to give good pip for the day in the real world Today as you know gj is bearish and any pull back is opportunity for short except one or two strong move to the upside as you can see most of the time the bulls were facing down .

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I like to mention the bull and bear numbering little more in detail I am using the number 1 to 10 for the analysis Bull + 1 to +10 Bear -1 to -10 Long : The gold lines started to looking up First candle +1 ( Bull) -10 ( Bear) The second candle onwards the numbering changes to +2,+3,+4 etc ( Bull) +1,+2+3 ( bear) In the strong up trend both the bull and bear number goes in + Short : The Red lines started to looking down First candle -1 ( Bear) +10 ( bull) The second candle onwards the numbering changes to -2,-3,-4 etc (bear) -1,-2,-3 (bull) In the strong down trend both the bear and bull number goes in minus In the bearsih market if you wish to go long First the Gold lines should be looking up Candle closed both the bull and bear number + Enter for trade the next candle Red lines are facing down The move up with bull number + and bear number - only qualifies for further short trade or new short trade sorry I have not mentioned this details in my first post

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi harigp Thank you for sharing your strategy. It's appreciated! I have a question regarding the entry after the candle closes. I am confused. According to this chart, your indication shows potential sell orders being executed during these points. However the candles never closed above the 21 EMA(high). They were between the low and high EMA. (This is where I am confused) Is the rule for short entries : Candle Closed above EMA 21 (High) with Bear Number( Minus) -.01 and below? Thank you for your clarification as I would like to test with properly understanding the rules. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1232454592

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Fx cash Thank you for your interest. I have done post 22 now where I have clarified little more about the long and short entries by looking into the market condition.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi harigp I've also been experimenting with the bull and bear strength indicators. It's only early days but seems to work well. I use 5min charts too and have guppy ma's on the chart for trend direction. If the trend is down I use the bears indicator and wait for a retrace on it. As the price and indicator retrace, I put a sell order just below the low of that bar. And vice-versa for a buy. I added a Stoch oscillator to make sure I'm not buying in an overbought marker or selling in an oversold market. So far the bear/bull indicators look very promising as long as there is a filter with it. Good luck with your system Bobby

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thanks for the quick reply harigp. So with the new clarification of the rules on post 22, there is NO 21EMA's used for closing of the candles? We can trade without to make entry decisions? Thanks

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Fx Cash Candle closed above 21 EMA gives you the highest level of going short with good amount of pip gain and that will be your starting point for the day and if the market continues to be bearish further move up as mentioned in post 22 provides you further short entries/ short entries for traders who were late in catching the candle above 21 EMA provided the market is still bearish

--- 帖子 #27 ---
harigp, Thanks for the clarification. Will give it a shot.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
new short entry Candle Bear number -.05 candle between two EMA bull no .24 Closed for 54 pip The closed candle has bear no -.98 and bull no -.24 The market is bearish used the opportunity of retrace

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I'm curious about the .01 rule. I've been watching e/u all day and have gone back several days and can't find when the bear/bull ever reached .01 +/- At the zero line they start at .000 +or- and work up or down from there. Today at one point then the e/u dropped 100pips, the bear never went further then -.0036 Is there something I need to change in my settings or what? thx, todd

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi todd I am attaching the EU chart where the candle was above 21 EMA and had bear no -.0007 and the red line are looking down. -.01, -.02 -.03 -.04 are all good for entries provided other conditions are met You should be using the data window for the numbers for bull and bear

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Please post a chart when referring to indicator numbers. I would like to be able to follow what you are saying. Thank you for posting this interesting method. Steve

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thank you very much Flamenco143. That makes it much more clear. todd

--- 帖子 #33 ---
When you get some time, could you post the charts of where you've found entries and why on the GBP/JPY either long or short, because I am not finding hardly any entries at all based on your description in the first or revised post. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes I will post one or two charts with reason for entry on gj, but I am not able to post the data window along with the chart may be I dont now how to post along with the data window. The chart will show the details of bull and bear number

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Short entry Chart Attached Candle above 21 EMA had bear number minus .13 and bull number +.08 Trigger candle bear minus .016 and bull minus .02 The red lines of bear all looking down +45 pip move By looking at the one hour chart and 30 minute chart it seems to me that it could be a bull day today. So I am planning any pull back I will go long and further long let us see

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks. I will study this entry tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks for that chart. You're not on Interbank, which is OK. The feeds are slightly different between Interbank, and whatever broker you use, but over time will average out. I think you're also applying the Exponential Moving Average differently than I am, because that particular entry wouldn't have applied if the EMA is applied to Median Price and some other settings. It WOULD apply if I set it to "First Indicator's Data". What do you apply the EMA to on your chart, so I can be in sync with you? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi paradoxical I was out the whole day I can see some good move in us session short I am using EMA 21 High and EMA 21 LOW Have you did some trade in demo Today the chart I posted to you I had good pip return plus two further shorts

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi harigp, One question. When you say that close of bar must be above EMA High for a Short Entry, do you refer to the close of price candlestick or HeikenAshi candlestick? They could be different... And, could you explain a little further about re-entries? I don't get it. Thanks masilva

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi harigp. I set it to 21 high and 21 low. But, there's another setting inside the indicator that changes where the lines end up at. Depending on which one you use, the closed candle can be inside or outside the line. This is the "Apply To" box. I put in there "Previous Indicators Data" and this setting seems to be close to what you used. If you use a different one, please let me know. I am doing some demo trades today. One lost and two won. From what I'm observing, looks like this reflects price action, which will usually give you winners if you follow it. Must have taken you or someone a long time tinkering and chart watching to come up with these particular settings. I like trading when a pair is at a temporary extreme from center, and headed back. The thing I didn't have before was timing the reversal. This seems to be a way to do that.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Can you post the screen shot of the EMA setting you are using and also the screen shot of the entry you have lost by the way this method is developed by me only and yes lot of time was put to study the chart etc Now I am in the process of studying the entry purely based on heiken ashi without EMA and any other indicator

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Below is a chart of the mentioned trades with comments. Appears to be 3 instances where entries would have lost?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
In checking back on the chart on the GBP/JPY, there is a fair amount of time that the close is just inside the 21 MA, and the reading is -.01 or less, where the trade would have been a real winner. Have you tested that? In most cases on the potential short trades, it looks like the candle is red, and there's not even an upswing at all before the pair goes down by a good twenty pips and a lot more. I'll keep my eye on this too. VERY interesting little system you have here. I know you want to keep the thread to one pair, but as you say, the E/U is good for this too, with the same settings.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi paro Thanks for posting the chart. The one you have marked where the price started to move up but stopped out. I have identfied those ones as further short trade. The reason for that are The Red Bear indicator is down The Bull number eventhough + the later candles does not have both the bull and bear number as + for the price to go up Yesterday us session there was a massive fall the bear number was -.98 first candle and second candle it was -1.25 something like that. It shows great bear power. yes I have noticed -.01 inside the EMA 21 and possible profit There going to be lot of observation about the numbering of bull and bear

--- 帖子 #45 ---
HI masilva I missed your question It is close of HA candle not the close price

New/ Add on Short chart

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Still following &amp; studying your system, and am very impressed. From your last post and other posts, you would not take a long position even when the bulls show a PLUS when the red bear bars are below zero on the chart. Thanks for that clarification. Still not sure how one would have known to go short at that point, but that's OK. I like how you've used the 21 MA in conjunction with the plus/minus readings to weed out false entries. There's very little retrace after entry in most cases on these trades. I think as more people look at this system you've developed, this thread will get a lot of notice.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi parodoxical Thank you for the encouragment which is needed Like I said in of the post I am in the process of studying the HA candles and like to use in conjection with our bull and bear power. I have noticed some good entries based on that but let me see things carefull during weeekend to post some basic of HA

--- 帖子 #49 ---
If you can, and have the time, it might be good to post your template and indicators on post #1. I have the Heiken Ashken candles, but they don't match yours, and I don't think they are a stock indicator on MT4. I've had to fool around with the settings on the moving average indicator to get it as close to your posted charts as possible. The "Parameter" setting of "Apply To" that makes my chart closely match yours is "Apply To" HIGH. But, I'm not even sure if this is what you use. This does a make a difference because the candle close may be inside or outside the 21 Moving Average line depending on which one you use. I also see that the readings are different...obviously, from your broker to mine, and in some cases, there are excellent trades even if you get a candle close inside the 21 Moving Average when everything else otherwise matches. I knw stops are always an issue, and I don't think I've seen it go more than 50 PIPS against the trade, and most all trades will gain at least 20 pips, with some going well over 50 to 100 or more. Will continue demoing.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
HA attached EMA I apply to high only and Low only I will try to send the screen shot of EMA Have you seen the move now on gj I did enter the candle bull and bear + Had some 75 pip gain

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I think the one in the attached chart is the trade you're referring to. Yes, I did have my eye on that trade, but hesitated because the red bear candle was just a little bit below the zero line. My reading was +.10 on the bulls and -.07 on the bears at the time. For those watching this thread, that trade could have given you 172 pips if you closed at the high, or 114 if you closed at the second red candle. The drawdown was only 27 pips.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Just want to share my chart to you, Snake Bull Bear chart. It seem deference for each pairs to set the level of bull and bear indicator.

Hi could it be the data feed because all the candles were in the 21EMA channel?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Ericoc, I had the same issue where my candles were further inside the 21 Moving Average. In the idnicator there are settings you can change. One of them is "Apply To". try fiddling with those settings. When I use "Previous Indicators Data", I seem to get the candles to move more outside the 21 Moving Average than with some of the other settings. Also, the feeds do vary between brokers.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi paradoxcial I got your point about EMA what I have done is EMA high and low applied to chart.In the chart then I went and applied one of the EMA as applied to first indicator data. So the EMA chart now has EMA 21 high as well as EMA 21 first appled to data. Seems Like you observed better entry and clear visual so my chart will be like you for EMA 21

--- 帖子 #56 ---
By the way, I'm excited about this system you've developed. I've not used the HA candles before, but I'm beginning to like them. Also, the bull and the bear numbers I hadn't used before, but I can see they are better than moving average crosses to guage the strength of a movement one way or the other. When you combine with your method of entry when it's outside the 21 moving average, but showing signs of moving back in by virtue of the plus or minus on the bull or bear, I like it a lot. Has only been a few days, but I can see and predict movement of a pair much better with this than I think all the other methods I've used. I think this thread will grow as more people check it out and see the possibilities. I'm keeping it to your GBP/JPY discussion, but this also works for the E/U and G/U that I've had the time to check so far. Logically, it should also work for different time frames with altered settings. But, if one can get 50 pips a day with a 5 minute chart, that's all one needs. I think the key is that a pair tends to move back towards center, and you've found an excellent way to get in at just about the right time, and also and more importantly, when NOT to get in. Won't be all winners. Nothing is. Thanks for making a thread for it.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi paro thanks for that Have we now synchronise with our EMA for future discussion Wait some more interesting matters will be used along with this bull and bear to predict the movement in advance Hope fully next week

Hi Harigp...same question..or HA just for exit?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Check the EU 5 minute chart where I have the HA candle in colour Red and Blue. For Short: Where ever the blue colour candle closed with blue and white on top of the candle and does not have paper clip formation you go short the next candle and also the bear indicator is looking down For long After the down trend if you spot red colour candle with paper clip followed by blue colour candle with bull indicator This is my first observation:

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I can't get my HA candles to resemble yours. I know how to change the color from white to blue, but I can't get the definition you do. Are you using some other modifications, or a special HA candle?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Bonjour harigb Firstly, thank you for your sharing 13h05 / First arrow: candle closed below EMA21 (low) and outside the EMA's range but bulls condition still not right 13h10 / Second arrow: bulls closed at 0.02 13h15 / Third arrow: open buy on the next candle. 119.63 Is it right or not ?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi paro Are you using the HA Which I posted to you yesterday.If not can I see your screen shot I had good pip run +350 pip using HA Hi Theery There seems to some pip gain on your entry.Is that correct

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Harigb In your post #61 your first contract sell is in the EMA's range and you said that we do not trade in range !? Clarification please ?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
hi para,thanks for assisting me with the charts yesterday.just try typing alt+2 and i believe you will get something close to harigp's charts.i believe you are using the bar's instead of the Japanese candles.

OOOpps 100pip

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Therrey The basic concept remains the same bull an bear power, But if you go back few post before I have started to introduce the HA candle colour formation and those entries when the HA blue colour had white on the top and bear indictor was down and the general bearsih trend was in progress. The net result of those two short entries were well above +200 pip yes one candle was between EMA but other one was above 21 EMA My future plan is to remove EMA fully and entry based only on HA colour formation along with bull and bear power READ POST 59

--- 帖子 #69 ---
And why not do more simple ? Short entry The candle HA closed below EMA21 (low) and outside EMA's range Sell stop on the low and open on the next candle if the low is reach. Example: the fourth sell stop is not open and no loss Long entry The candle HA closed above EMA21 (high) and outside EMA's range Buy stop on the high and open on the next candle if the high is reach.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
hI thierry I understand the method you described. But I am more on to Instant execution based on the concept in post 59 It has given good result so far. The HA formation is only in intial stage now.

hi harigp it is an interesting method , i had this demo trade as per attached chart , bear was -0.12 and i got 100 pip. i have a problem with HA it do not look on my chart as on yours , do i have to change some settings thanks

Hi Todd Go to MT 4 Navigator you will get it their So far I have not seen the custom made bull and bear indicator

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I was looking at this indicator...might be useful....at least I thought it was...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Really good trading system I'll try it in next several weeks and let you know about results.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks Ranger for the indicator. It adds bull and bear together for each candlestick , then gives you the result. If bull is strong and bear is weak, it will show strong bull minus the weak bear giving you what is left. That is different then waiting for both to be in agreement but it may give you an earlier entrance. I like it .

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hello, You think dont work good if you buy when the bar close above 21 ema hight whit bull and bear + and sell when bar close below 21 ema low whit bull and bear - ? Thank you for share your interesting system..

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Ranger, I like this and will use this in place of the other ones. It gives a better view, I think.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
hi chrys In the 5 minute chart if there is a bull run the candle reaches the top and the bull gets exhausted and a reversal becomes on the way and we go for short. The reverse for going long when bear gets exhausted. This is the short terms approach for us to get some pip If you are planning for a longer trade and if you see bull run still continues in the higher time frame like M 30 or one hour chart and if you have some long contract already the pullback from EMA 21 (above) can be used as adding some more long contracts and reverse for bear run in higher time frame by adding some more shorts. I like to clarify here bull run or bear run completed in time frame 5 minutes does not mean the end of bull/bear run because in higher time frame bull/bear run is still in progress In forex market it is the approach you wish to take like you want to be an intraday trader looking for short term gain or long trade by using higher time frame and adding long or shorts Like you said if it is ++ above EMA 21 and you are going long you may get very little or some time you risk also because candle above 21 EMA in 5 minuute chart according to me is period of reversal going to happen and vice versa below 21 EMA

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Good day to you, Harigp Very interesting observation you have come up with. Looks like a great price action pattern that repeats with relative consistency. Will do some live testing. Will start by going for 5 to 10 pips per trade only to see the initial success rate / hit rate. Will only be able to test for 3 to 4 hours per day. Will let you know how it goes... Regards

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Tau Thanks for that, You can expect much more than that if you enter at the right time and if you read about my post regrding HA colour formation and shape you could be a good winner I am planning again a summary of HA colour pattern and shape after little more observation along with bull and bear number. You will be able to predict the next move early using HA with bull and bear

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Good day to you, Harigp I understand that there might be a lot of pips on the table under certain conditions, but I believe that for me to fully exploit a trading system, I will need to "trust" the entry first. From there, then work on an exit that can be trusted too. I will thus test the entry as many times as possible and only take 5 to 10 and then get out, waiting for the next. This way, I can determine the initial hit rate or success rate. Have you looked at the combination bull and bear indicator posted earlier? This looks nice and clean and seems to give the same signal for entry to the overlapping indicator you are currently using. Your thoughts? Regards and all success

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Harigp Are you still using EMA21 HIGH and EMA21 LOW or have you changed it in the apply box, Plus can you upload a screen shot of your HA setting box.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
hi uk cool For the time being I am using both EMA high and low as well EMA high and apply to first indicator for the purpose of my study Like I said in my previouse post the EMA will be taken out and the trade wiil be based on HA and bull and bear power I hope we will be able to do this I will be sharing more about HA and the point of reversal

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi Tau No issues about that Yes the new bull and bear is in my system with my MT4 bull and bear

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Showing the char M5 the paper clip and the move down M 30 bearish I took the trade at the paper clip and pip gain was +100 not closed the contract because the M 30 is still bearish with bear bar still down and no HA paper clip formation so far

--- 帖子 #95 ---
You guys will be wondering why I am talking about M30 chart. I said in my earlier post there will be class with M 30 chart You have to open M5 and M 30 as tile vertically and see the action with M 5 of course with the understanding of HA COLOUR AND FORMATION I AM GOING WITH +100 PIP and I know still I can go short in M5 after a while based on chart M 30 beacuse the bear indicator is down and no HA formation so far to go long. Hope fully

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Good day to you, Harigp Took a first tester. Attached screenshots. Used 5minute Eur/Usd. As said, will test entry first to get trust in the system and will then work on exit. Took 14 pips and exited. There were more to take, but I would like to continue getting comfortable with the entry first. Thanks for sharing. Was fun. Live trade...

Good day to you, Possible consideration for re-entry? Let me know your thoughts...

--- 帖子 #98 ---
As long as the bull indicator are up in M 5 and M30 the pull back will be the opportunity for going long again

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Good day to you, Look at the following setup and let us find a way to not get involved. Either a break of the low of the signal bar, or higher timeframe to signal valid entry.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
For me that entry I would have gone long on that pull back as new entry or addition to my contract because M 30 is bullish Now when I look into M 30 chart the current bar and the previouse bar are gettting equal but still some minutes left In the M 30 the current bar is getting the formation of white on top of the blue

Hi sameer I have mentioned in post before that when bull or bear run is on going and if there is a pull back we enter long or short accordingly The only additional time frame I have introduced is the M 30 CHART which provides a good indication of the present trend BULL TREND GO LONG WHEN THERE IS PULL BACK CONFIRM WITH M 30 CHART ALSO BEAR TREND GO SHORT WHEN THERE IS PULL BACK CONFIRM WITH M 30 CHART ALSO USE HA COLOUR CHANGE AT THE TIME OF ENTERING DURING PULL BACK BELOW EMA 21 WILL BE YOUR START OF THE TRADE AND VICE VERSA TRADERS WHO MISSED THE FIRST MOVE CAN USE PULL BACK AS THE TIME TO ENTER THE MARKET

Hi Hari, do you mean as long as HA TF 30 white, we will take long only (with rules in page 1 and TF5min)?.And we wait pullback in TF5min,right?....Correct me if i'm wrong, please. thanks

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi guys, Very nice thread. Seems profitable. I want to ask an stupid question. What's ''paper clip'' formation? What do you mean by ''paper clip''? Can you explain it in detail and show picture??? Thank you very much. Cheers, Dudu

--- 帖子 #112 ---
hI kapten yes you are correct and the bull indicators all up So far the sequence of events are as follows 1 Introduced the basic trade EMA 21 low and EMA 21 High 2 introduced the pull back and trade for long or short 3 introduced the HA colour and formation. I advise the members to read the post about HA because it is gives us the early warning signals. You also cross check with TF 5 and TF 30. 4 Introduced the concept of using Tframe 30 to look for the current trend and trade accordingly Today the trend was bullish and the trade was pull back and trade for long

Paper clip this is the word I have created i have attached the chart showing the red candle having paper clip below that red candle and you can see after the paper clip candle what happens to the price movement.

Kapten, we all started out as noobies at some point. In order to get your candles to look like his, you have to play with the zoom in and zoom out. If you make your candles small enough, they'll look just like his. Then, just scroll back on the screen and observe the candle patters, and see what they look like. You'll see that most of the time, the pair will go op when there's no "paper-clip" looking thing on the bottom of the red candle, and the opposite for the blue candles. I'm nho expert on HA candles, but I believe this configuration is due the buying and selling action at the close, which then leads to more busing/selling at the next candle. If you want to make your candles really big, they won't look like paper clips any more at all. You'll start to see things that look like hammers and tommy hawks. Tyhere's been entire books written on the subject by people who've studied these pattersn extensively.....much more than I have.

Hi Harigp, To enable us to be all on the same page as you, could you please help by posting your template. This way everybody's settings will be the same. Many thanks. Your system certainly looks interesting. Pardy

hi harigp i am tring to understand the HA formation please correct me if i am wrong 1- HA red with white at the end of it means trend continuation 2- HA red with paper clip at the end means the trend will change and inverse from long . am i right ? and i would like to know when in an up trend we have a pull back candle red HA to reenter long do we need the bull to be abpve 0.01 ?? thanks for your help

--- 帖子 #123 ---
You are correct in all the questions you have asked Yes enter on pull back shoud be backed by bull + for long and bear - for short At the time of going long or short M 30 IS BULLISH/bearish with all the indicator up/down . keep both the chart time frame 5 and 30 verically If M 30 chart candles are moving in lines it is period of consolidation The candles should move in orderly fashion up or down Try to post chart of your entries

--- 帖子 #124 ---
hi again please look at the char bellow , the paper clip witch it should be as u said a sign of a trend reversal. in this up trend every candle is having a paper clip witch it should signal a reverse but the trend is going up . so i am wondering about how reliable is this formation . thanks

--- 帖子 #125 ---
when I talked about paper clip I always refered to red candle with paper clip and I have not said anything about paper clip on white candle. check my post In an up move the trend reversal happens if you notice as follows BLUE COLOUR CANDLE HAVING WHITE ON THE TOP AND NORMALLY IN M 30 CHART THE CANDLE USED TO BE SMALL Look Carfully The Chart I Posted The Red Candle After The Vetical Line And See The Bottom Of That Candle Does Not Have White On The Bottom But Paperclip ( The Word I Created)

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Harigp and Paradoxial.. Thanks for the answer...i really appreciate that...So I have to change HA color to blue and red..and Candle Color with white and None I think, i have a visual about paperclip I will try to backtest... So...this "paperclip" is for confirmation when rules agree?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Here's a copy of my template along with the combined Bull-Bear Power attachment and the HA too. Hope it helps. The Bulls Power and Bear Power Histo is added from the regular indicator list. P.S. I had chart candle colors reversed. Change regular candles to: Bull = black: Bear =White. Then it should match up with harigp's charts. Bears Bull Power should be set at 14! CORRECTED TEMPLATE HERE AND ON POST #145

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Coming back to the post of sameer asking why the paper clip on the blue candle and what it represents. After careful thought it is like this completion of bear Run : noticed red candle with clip so we are expecting the trend reversal for bull run and you will have blue candle with clip completion of bull Run : you notice blue candle with white on top and reversal for bear run you will have red candle with white on the bottom

for buy entry you wait that bull and bear power is above 0 right and blue Ha candle? or you wait only for bull power to be above 0 line? thanks for clarification regards lodol

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Lodol Yes that will be the starting point of your entry and if the bear power continues you will also buy at the time of pull back and the bear power is + Most of the cases the bull no starts with blue candle or the candle could be little red in colour most of the cases you buy after a massive down trend or meduim down trend Further read post 1, HA COLOUR AND PIN, M 30 CHART

Hi Hari, i download your templates and i can see 21 sma hight/low but in your first post you was writing 21 ema hight/low. which is correct? Also i can see bull/bear 14 for default indicators overimposed but 13 for custom bull/bear indicator. Which is correct 13 or 14?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
My previous template was wrong. The Bull/Bear Power is corrected to read 14 now in the template if you chose to use it over (or with) the original ones. Also EMA's are corrected. Sorry for the mistakes. Shouldn't post when I'm trading live!

Just came accross this interesting system. Please correct me if I am making a mistake. 1. Wait for a heikin ashi reversal signal (paper clip) outside 21 emas. 2. Check data window for bull bear value. If HA below emas, bull indicator is greater than 0.1, then buy. If HA above emas, bear indicator less than -0.1, then sell. 3. Please, clarify more on exits. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
hi wahnone You are correct with your statment and exit if you are working in 5 minute chart and you are interested in short trade Long : exit when you see the either white on Top of Blue in HA candle and bear indicator started to dominate Short: Exit when you see red HA with the pin and bull indicator started to dominate.

Hi wah There is one indicator called period convertor. Tommorow I will post with steps to use the M 2

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi, wah Here is the period converter that you are looking for.save it in your mt4 indicator file.open the 1min tf of the currency you want and select the indicator from the navigation frame.After selecting the ind make sure that on the common tab, tick on "allow DLL imports" and on the input tab put "2" at the "period multiplier "then click "OK". Now on the control bar select "file "then "open offline" then the 2min tf of the currency you want then select "open".It will open the 2min tf chart.Make sure you dont close the 1min chart that you initially opened. I hope i have explained it clearly.

Hi harigp , I am trying to make sense of your recent chart and the remarks and cant put it together. The red up arrow at 04:08, is that where you read "Bulls Bears 27 29"? Did you long at the close of this candle? I have a reading of Bulls -0.08 and Bears -0.27

--- 帖子 #177 ---
hI DAN The candle where I have drawn the vertical line IN M 2 CHART after the close had the reading of bull -27 and bear -29 Entry was in the next candle

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Ok thanks, on that candle I have -25 and -32 on IBFX.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Dan In that case based on your reading with IBFX you may have to wait may be next candle to get the diff of bull and bear to a level of 1 or 2

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Yes, but on the next candle I had already Bulls -8 and Bears -27

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Yes an Indication that the bull are getting stronger Can youlet me know what was the closing price of that candle

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Close was 127.01

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi dan My Entry was at 126.85 can you check whether any of the subseuent candle had the bull and bear diff of say less than 5 and what was the closing price and How far you could have gone My extreme price was around 127.85

--- 帖子 #184 ---
The low was 126.78 and the candle that made that low close 126.84. The following candle values are bull/bear: -8 -27 +20 -11 (first candle closing above the emas) +24+10 at this time the move is long gone bulls and bears are set to 14

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Dan Sorry to ask you this can you check the previouse candles where you have the small diff in time frame 2 and the price ( closing)

--- 帖子 #186 ---
4:06 | -10 -29 close: 126.87 4:04 | -6 -16 close 127.05 4:02 | -8 -10 close: 127.11 this was the closest bear and bull reading

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi dan Any way you had one candle closed at a dif of 2 with a closing price of 127.11 . Both of our settings are same period 14 in M 2 chart It is all about the diff betwen brokers. You could have grabbed around 70 to 80 pip from the opening of next candle The reason by me to choose the diff of 2 is to enter the market after the completion of the previouse wave.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
What do you think about measuring the rate of change for bulls/bears between candles, instead of the difference. That way you (or me for that matter) would have caught the bull run.

Hi wed wed The bull and bear concept is all about waves. You have the large wave coming and hitting the shore and retrace back to the sea and keeps happening for somtime After a while the strength of waves reduces and sometimes it may not even touch the shore and keeps playing inside the sea Inside the sea could be candles moving in stright line or candles inside between Two EMA You may collect few pip and you will expect large waves and it can come only if there is high tide mean to say high level of bull or bear activity

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi prasath 2008 I have seen the screen shot of the arrows but in my opinion some of the arrows gives false signals and some of them can jump into trade and can result in loss Identification of the HA paper clip may not be visible sometimes in the chart but if you look into previouse price action, current market trend and from where the candles has moved to the current place etc .you will be able to make the judgment as to what should be your next action/where the candles can move next

Hi BB Thanks for your opinion yesterday only i just installed the indicator and not yet tested i will test it on monday and let see whether it is jumping or giving acuracy and then i will post it here

Refer post 212 for the set up for the last trade

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Wt is the setup for your last post and how to trade in that

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi Prasath 2008 When I started this thread till last week the trade was based on EMA High and EMA Low with bull bear number. Go Long when M 30 IS BULLISH and Short when M 30 is bearish and talked about contracts at the start of the day and additional contract while pull back etc. This system does not have any other indicator and in the longer term at least for a day there was no proper idea about how the market is going to move for the rest of the day or days based on this system, and I felt the importances of the longterm direction. Again there are indicators to measure the support and resistence but I thought I will develope one. This is a very simple procedure to use do the set up as per the post 212 and monitor the market on M 5 Post 212 says to draw the horizontel line on the top and bottom of the one hour bar you have choosen and flip the bar to M 5. If you see the candles are further moving upwards breaking the top of the one hour candle you have choosen you could possibily go long and when it reaches the peak draw another horizontel line and see after some retracment is it is going to break the new high and possibility of another long. This way I have tried to check the general trend of the market whether it is bullish or bearish For this puporse you have to select one one hour candle closed(latest) at the time of starting your trade and measure the high or low as described above and move accordingly This is just on an experment baisis started today The latest GJ CHART ATTACHED The basic rules of entry and exit reamains the same the new approach is only to find out the long term view

--- 帖子 #233 ---
gmt 3 lower = R1 is crossed now crossed gmt 3 higher which is R2 Collected 58 pip contract entered just above R 1

--- 帖子 #234 ---
The support and resistence experment was sucessful so far and just above R 2 is the candles are placed. I expect further development based on 16 hours GMT

Some of the contract booked: EU M 30 bullish Picked contract in one minute at pull back GJ M 30 Bearish Picked contract in one minute at pull back

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I am still a bit confused about your system. What are the bull bear numbers that are to be satisfied? Sorry if I am disturbing.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
HI wah You might have understood about the HA COLOUR and formation As long as M 30 is bullish/ bearish You can use either M 1/ M2 to see any pullback is happening and wait for the pull back to complete and go for long and short accordingly I am keeping the following windows open M 1, M2, M5 AND M 30 I make sure that M 30 the bull and bear indicator is up or down and the candles are above or bellow the EMA and monitor the M 1 OR M 2 for a proper pull back and enter for trade

--- 帖子 #245 ---
The market is now very active and good result

--- 帖子 #246 ---
You mean you check for both the bull and bear indicators to be above in both the 30min and the 2min for a buy. Vise versa for sell.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Chart showing where i have entered short

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Ho Wah yes it is correct .I made a detailsed explantion for this but due to internet problem it go erased

--- 帖子 #249 ---
one possible short developing

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I think there is no need to look at the data window anymore. Just check for a kind of retrace on 2min and enter when both bull and bear are above and coming down for a sell.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi Wah To some extent you are correct, I kept practiced on this with M 1 AND M 2 and M 30

--- 帖子 #252 ---
What do you say? A potential sell setup?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi wah But if you see the M 30 the candles are still not belwo the EMA 21 low

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Harigp, Nice method, kindly refresh my memory how to construct a 2min chart from MT 4 platform pls. Did it long time ago completely lost track with the steps. Thanks

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi, wah Here is the period converter that you are looking for.save it in your mt4 indicator file.open the 1min tf of the currency you want and select the indicator from the navigation frame.After selecting the ind make sure that on the common tab, tick on "allow DLL imports" and on the input tab put "2" at the "period multiplier "then click "OK". Now on the control bar select "file "then "open offline" then the 2min tf of the currency you want then select "open".It will open the 2min tf chart.Make sure you dont close the 1min chart that you initially opened. I hope i have explained it clearly. Attached Files

Trying out New Time frame as follow M 10 Main chart ( checking bullish or bearish) M 1 AND M 2 for entry

--- 帖子 #257 ---
M 30 candles below EMA 21. Price went high after the UK news Took Short . I also looked into the support and resistence by using 8 gmt one hour candle. Price has no broken the high of 8 gmt candle

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I would suggest that you make a summary of how to trade this system because there have been different improvements which need to be reflected on the first post so that we won't have to read the whole thread.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi Wah Yes I am Planning to do that during the week end with charts etc

--- 帖子 #260 ---
M 30 candles below EMA 21. Price went high after the UK news Took Short . I also looked into the support and resistence by using 8 gmt one hour candle. Price has not broken the high of 8 gmt cand The above was the trade taken after the UK news. The trade was not taken During the news result but waited for things to develop I am attaching the chart of 1 Hour, M 5 start of 9 gmt and M 5 second chart While i was on trade 8 GMT WAS THE CLOSED candle This the trade based on support and resistence level looking into bullish bearsih market condition. This method is on trail basis Charts are ONE HOUR CHART SHOWING THE 8 GMT CANDLE One hour chart flipped to five minutes and marked the top and bottom of the 8 gmt closed candle and identifed the start of 9 gmt candle Second chart : 5 minute chart showing the breaking the top of the 8 gmt candle and subsequent development M 30 CHART TO SHOW THAT THE MARKET WAS BEARISH THAT TIME DURING UK NEWS TIME

--- 帖子 #261 ---
When ever there is some more development I am posting it here I was checking the stoch as an additional indicator to the system and it work very good as follows Time frame 5 minutes Stoch set up 30.3.3 Level 80 and 20 Candles placed above 21 EMA high Stoch drops from 80 and also bear and bull inicator down go for short and vice versa for long Very stright forward and the above stoch not looking good in M1 and M 5 Check the screen shot

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Some contract went for short based on stoch

--- 帖子 #263 ---
The latest on the same contract The M 30 stoc setting will be 3.3.3

--- 帖子 #264 ---
M5 and M 30 both stoc goes hand in hand Till M 30 turns out to bullish any pull back in M 5 will be due for going short now +83 pip

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I think you entered when stoch went above 80 and comin down and when both bull and bear indicator go into minus(-) zone. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi wah I know that the market is bearish which is confimed in M 30, HI, Daily Yes the stock went from 20 in both time frame towards 80 but I have not done anything becauseI was wating for the short to play and when it reached above 80 and when the candles reached the top of EMA high in M5 and stock started to come down from 90 I pulled the trigger . The pip generated is +200. I can also go long but pip wise short is much better By the way this is going to be trade method with stoc and bull and bear indicator. i dont think I need more research will keep this system and on sat I will make a summary final

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I think I understand now. The only thing still confusing me is how to use the bull bear indicators.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi wah As long as bull and bear indicator in M 30, H1, DAILY is down in all these time frames. In M 5 we do the job only of waiting the candles to go high up and pull it from their I am not suggesting that you never should go long you can based on the situtaion As long as the candles in M 30 is not braking the EMA 21 high it can be short short and short

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Got it.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi wah Try to post charts of your trade can be another short as per chart till everything is fromed properly and candles does not cross EMA 21 in M 30 You can see in m5 the stoc is moving fast to reach 80 and above but the price is not moving that fast. In M 30THE STOc has already reached 75 but the price movement is slow

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Potential sell developing

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Potential sell developing

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Let us see how far the stoc will go

--- 帖子 #274 ---
The first potential sell opportunity(first red line) would'nt be taken because the stoch is not overbought. The 2nd opportunity would be taken(2nd line) and we would have exited at the change of heikin ashi colour. The 3rd would be taken when heikin ashi changes to red.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
HI wah There is one more thing developing here the us important new as you can see the stoc made a u trun after the news wich was + so still I am waiting to things to develop more Just before the news the long could have got app +47 pip and the drop in stoc just before the news could have +30 pip but still waiting

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Would you have taken that long? It was below the ma low on 30 min.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes I would have taken it the time I started the thread , the entry is valid in all respect. But I am trying to see the big picture of market condition and try to trade that way There is no way Idisrespect that long entry by using the M1 OR M 2 time frame.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Wah The M 5 stoc can go up to zero zero when I had the entry in the afternoon whihc has neted +220 pip

I closed half of my position at 20 and the second half was stopped out at break even.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi wah Today I noticed the M 5 STOC 30.3.3 had a sharp fall and gone to the lower level and the reading on the left meter was zero zero Still i have not taken the trade because I am not happy with the stoc movement in M 5 as well as M 30

--- 帖子 #283 ---

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Wah Do You think the candle will break EMA high in time Frame 30

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Already broke the EMA high but a strong down bar is forming. Would you say we are in a general buy direction from the picture?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
No I dont think it will go up I had a short for +40 pip

--- 帖子 #292 ---
By what criteria did you take the short? Pls explain with chart. Bcos while checking 30min, no clear direction is seen.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi Wah The chart attached but it is not my main aim. Also in M 30 chart I have seen white on top of blue at the time of taking short.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Just shorted EURUSD 5min. 30min general sell and retrace on 5min confirmed by stoch going overbought. Let's see...

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi wh Check the 4 hour chart a blue candle has developed there after a long time May the plan nees to be changed. There is paper clip formation also in H 4 possiblity of down trend can stop for a while

--- 帖子 #296 ---
So you go as high as 4hr to know the direction to trade. Interesting. BTW, closed EURUSD for +10 pips.

Hi wah There was only one stright entry but there was part closing of contracts and the last part posted and now closed for +230 pip

--- 帖子 #305 ---
So you mean after entering based on the stoch oversold, you closed part of your trades progressively.

The bull and bear indicators are very powerful in timing etnries. I watched its behaviour with price and I can see it is really powerful. Please, one more thing though, how do you set the stoploss? What do you also think about adding other pairs?

This gotta be the most ridiculous system i've ever seen....EMA's are lagging indicators......sheeeeshhhh..........

Hi gator Thanks for that if you read the thread I am not depended only on EMA there are other two indicators which is guiding the trade EMA is just an additional comfort for the trade purpose

Hi Uk cool M 2 Frame can be used to trade in two ways 1: Simple scalping using the indcators stated in the post 2: M 2 used for short trade along with M 30 CHART In the case of 2 above if the market is in bull run in M 30 Frame, monitor the M 2 FRAME for pull back and enter for long trade and vice versa for short trade. Most of the time I am using M 2 or M 5 for short trade

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi harigp, looks like a nice new idea(s) for trading the FOREX; it never ceases to amaze me how many different ways people come up with! Just be careful trying to find divergence with stochastic at the extremes because it has a bounded range and will appear to be leveling off and giving divergence against price. In reality it is leveling off because it can't go any higher or lower because its upper and lower limits are fiixed. Good luck. Gray.

I was looking into the break out strategey to find whcih direction the break out can lead I will post chart for the same and time used is 8, 9, 10 GMT and what we should be looking before the break out The time frame used is one hour and time frame 5 minutes I will post the first chart and the pair used iS GJ and I will go slowly on this The indicator for this is only HA and Auto pivot there are no other inicators The HA canldes will be marked in one hour to show what will come next . In GJ PAIR you should be prepared to keep +100 SL

--- 帖子 #310 ---
on 4 March 2008 at 6 GMT you are coming to your computer Table and you are watching the closing of 6 GMT CANDLE and you have to make some trade of buy or sell . The one hour chart is up to 6 GMT and confusing to make a proper judgement All you can see is some form of consolidation

--- 帖子 #311 ---
In the same one hour chart when you applied your Auto pivot you have seen that for the past 12 hours the candles are between the weekly pivot and S1 GMT MARKED 19 GMT AND 6 GMT There is some form of assurance that the price may not go down further and you are waiting for the brake out at 8 or 9 or 10 GMT

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Since the price is not dropping further for the last 12 hours and 8 GMT candle has formed . look into price action for 5 to 10 minutes. In the same one hour chart drill down the one hour to 5 minutes or keep 5 minute chart seperatley The attached chart is one hour drill down to 5 minutes and +200 pip move upwards

Hello Harigp, Very inspiring system. I tried to open M2 chart and it's offline. Is there a way to make it online? Thanks! thunderfx

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi thunder fx In the period convertor under common tick both the box and also check in MT 4 under options the expert advisor section tick all the box

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I have followed all your instructions. Still offline. Don't know why. Do I still miss something? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Here is the period converter that you are looking for.save it in your mt4 indicator file.open the 1min tf of the currency you want and select the indicator from the navigation frame.After selecting the ind make sure that on the common tab, tick on "allow DLL imports" and on the input tab put "2" at the "period multiplier "then click "OK". Now on the control bar select "file "then "open offline" then the 2min tf of the currency you want then select "open".It will open the 2min tf chart.Make sure you dont close the 1min chart that you initially opened. I hope i have explained it clearly.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Can you post this indicator in the upper right hand corner? Brian

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi, I have just come across this thread, and have spent the past hours reading through it and trying to understand it. I noticed, especially in the beginning of the thread, some people commenting on the amount of 'chart watching time' involved. Has anyone tried to make this into a EA? This also makes it a lot easier to backtest and tweak. I will try to do it myself as well, it's one of the best ways to really understand how a system works.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
You should be really going back to my other method called moving average trade . where You will get the big picture in H1 chart and place the trade in M15 . Since there was not big interest it was left behind

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Harigp, I get the general idea as outlined in your Moving Average Trade thread. However, like you said, that one got abandoned. I don't know why this one didn't get any follow up after '09 (btw, I only saw the date now, sorry for ressurecting such an old thread), because it is a very clear system, that seems very profitable as well... I am just trying to figure out how to read the HA bars exactly, to see which values to compare with the EMA's. Long story short, I do believe in this system, and I will make it into an indicator/EA to properly test and tweak/improve it.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
that will good and share with us the indicator/Ea
