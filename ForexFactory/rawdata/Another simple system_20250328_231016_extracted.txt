I have been working on another simple system, using just basically 2 indicators. Before I go any further, I found these indicators in Forex Factory(one of the best FX Forum) and credit completely goes to the person who created these indicators. I am also looking someone here to help create an EA for this system. Now for the system itself: Open a chart of any currency pair (preferably GBPUSD since I seem to have had very good success with this pair), either 1hr or 4 hr chart. Then put following Indicators. I have also attached the template.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Then look for Information on the Data window For bulls and Bears Numbers. When Bull number is above the Bear Number BUY and Vice versa

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Here is the chart showing the indicator column on the data window I concentrate on

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Don,t worry about minus sign before the "Bear number" Just concentrate on total Absolute number. In other words if The number in bear column is above the Bull number sell and vice versa I have been trying this system for almost two months and so far I had about 90% success. In my opinion it seems to work great on one hr chart. Hence I am looking someone to create an EA As far as the profit target goes I have been taking 20 pips on 1 hr chart and 50 pips on 4 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Here is the template

--- 帖子 #6 ---
ES Trader thanks for introducing new system its like your other system with ccfp indicator,Could you share exact entries?Can we check the bull/bear values in every candle? Thank you Best Regards

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yes You can check on every Bar. In fact the system works by looking at the Total Number ( bear or Bull) at the CLOSE of that bar and initiate trade accordingly

--- 帖子 #8 ---
What about the SL? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Open 4 hr chart and one can see How nicely this system works. Look at the 12:00 bar .The Bear number 814 and Bull number 821. Next Bar 16:00 bar the baer number changed to 882 and bull number to 376. I initiated Sell at 1.4614 and see where th Gbp usd is 1.4471

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Desi, I have been basically using high/low of the bar that initiated the trade. But that is something hopefully with the help of some of the great traders here we can work out all those kinks.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
what about other pairs?is this indicator more efficient than ccfp ?I wonder can we use this for basket trade? Thank You Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #12 ---
judger, I am sure this system probably would work with other currencies as well. But I have been trading only Gbpusd. I did not understand your question about using this on basket trade system. Can you explain further? Thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I mean multiple trades with correlated pairs,Do you still use your system with ccfp indicator? Thank You Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #14 ---
judger, yes, but this one seems to be even simpler than CCfp

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I will try it via simulator than share ideas Thank You Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks Judger

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi ES Simple most def, just one question whats the difference in numbers between bulls and bears before you take a trade. On the charts I +_ 500, is that you criteria if I may be so bold. If this system kick ass with GBP a lot of people will be wildly impress cause this pair has been kickin butt since its inception.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
shaanex, the difference does not have to be + or - 500. Even if there is small difference it is ok. I have traded when the difference was just 5 or 10. If you have doubt you can wait for he next bar to close and then take trade.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi, i briefly looked at the 1 hour eurusd. i looked at where its ranging and there seems to be so many false signals.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I have created an indy that just adds the Bull and Bear numbers and plots the value. Also I am attaching the source code for the originals. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks yesbee, I have tried that indicator where both bull/bear numbers are added. It does not seem to work well. I just initiate trade when the numbers flip.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Dashboard version of this indicator for multiple currencies will be great !! I hope some one could do it Thank You Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Eagle eye, I am sorry if you are seeing false signals. I did have about 10% false signals ( I only said I had 90% success not 100%) but when you initiate the trade in the direction of the new signal it seem to make up more than the loss you took on the wrong signal. I am sure you know there is No Holy Grail in Trading!!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
yes judger. But if someone can create EA it would be even great to test it.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
EsTrader, I'm trying to load the indicators onto a GBPUSD chart. When I copy the Bears.ex4, it is named "attachment.php." Why isn't it named Bears.ex4? It doesn't look your chart. Maybe I've got the wrong indicator. The template also said "attachment.php." And when I tried to save it, I got the msg that it was already there...

--- 帖子 #26 ---
go to the paper clip (upper right corner) and download it from there, or you can just rename it whatever you want

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi ES Can you please clarify what it means when the numbers flip? You mean to say the absolute values of one number is greater than the other? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Id love to see backtest results for this

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Yes I agree. that would be a big step forward.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I tried downloading the "bull bear power template" after shutting down the MT4 platform. Then reopened the platform. Nothing there. Should I be downloading all the attachments under the paper clip, or does the "bull bear power template" contain the individual Bear.ex4 and Bull.ex4?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Yesbee YES

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Mary4X I am not sure what the problem is. No one here seem to have had the problem you are describing. May be just delete and re download the template or indicator

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I looked on the charts to buy when bulls number is greater than bears number (only considering absolute value) and sell when opposite. I can't find a winner. Am I doing something wrong?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Save both the .exe files in the mt4/experts/indicator folder and the .tpl file in the mt4/template folder. Close and restart the MT4 platform and attach the template to the chart. If the files on the first page has extension .php then use the paper clip on the right top corner. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I'll try this, Desi. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I just took a quick test with your system and I think I like it. Simple, yet it seams effective! I will test it on the simulator tonight. Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
In your first post, you say to look for the larger number in the data window, to determine buy/sell status. How do these numbers correlate to the numbers shown in the indy window, since they seem to indicate the opposite recommendation. Rob

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Mary i have an issue when trying to download attachments from ForexFactory using google chrome browser. It wants to save everything as attachment.php. You might try using Firefox to download instead

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Whhere are you setting your stop loss? Maybe a few pips above or below the last candle? thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I see Ron Raygun here. May be now we can get some real Expert advice about this system especially creating an EA !!!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
ESTrader... Do you realize every bar is a signal? What do you have in terms of exit?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
without mentioning the exact entry so my understanding just like RR every bar is entry bar....my question are 1.do you exit every after current candle close and put another entry in the next bar [again my understanding every bar is signal since every next bar bull&amp;bear will show different value]....or you have another exit rule? 2.if every bar is signal,where you put stop loss [i'm thinking of previous bar hi for sell and prev bar low for buy.because if every bar is signal if we put stop loss in the last swing it might be to far if we're in the middle of a trend]..? and ty for sharing the system EST regard pv

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Are these the same bull and bear indicators that come standard with MT4?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Ron I initiate the sell trade ,for example ,when the Bear number is more than the Bull bar. Once I iniate the trade i put target of 20 pips ( on one hr bar and 50 pips on 4 Hr Bar)and SL on the high of the bar. Then wait for the next signal .that is when the signal changes for eg from sell to buy I take next trade.( to buy) . One of the option could be some kind of trailing stop or some other money mangement. Hope I did explain it clearly. thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
in your experience what kind of bar do you mostly taking the trade? what i mean here do you still suggest to take the trade [H1 for example] if the last bar longer than 50pips.because in my thinking for taking 20, the risk way too much if the last candle have big value [as we see a lot bar with value even more than 100 pips in gbp/usd H1]

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I have one more indicator for this system and i have tried it,but this system doesnt works,you might be short thinking bears are more and in next second bulls are more zapak u end in loss.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Just a couple of questions, you take a signal, for example a buy, if the next candle is a sell signal you close the previous trade and open a sell, or you let the first one run and you take also the second? Or, if you take for example a buy signal you let it run until it reaches tp or sl and then, when one of those levels is hit you take the next signal?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
1.close your metatrader 2. download the indi'd and templates to the right folders indicators to your metatrader/experts/indicators template to your metatrader/templates 3. open your metatrader 4. open a new chart 5. load the template 'bull bear power'

--- 帖子 #49 ---
When you take a signal based on any indicator, you might be short, and in the next candle "sapak", you end in loss because the opposite signal occurs. If ES trader opens a trade and wait until it reaches tp or loss the system barely breakeven, if he opens a trade and close his position at the close of the next candle if the opposite signal occurs it doesn't seem profitable too, at least according to my few backtests. I did a quick backtest on the last week using a 22 stoploss and tp using the simulator, I managed to do some profit, but using the signal candle high or low as stoploss I lost most of the trades ending with a big red. I think we might be missing something here... I hope ES trader can enlighten us. Best regards, Orcinus

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I tried your system on the simulator and had quite good success (around 70% winning trades). However I am thinking to add another indicator for confirmation, such as OSMA. Thanks a lot ES Trader, this is a nice simple system.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I tried with simulator too,I see the success rate is around 60-70,I think its quite good for catching trends in the middle ,i see a few examples of catching trends before the beginning (few examples of sell signal on a bull bar vice versa) and few examples of opposite big moves after that kind of losses generally catch a good trend and cover losses, this is my experiment. Thank You Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thanks fguru and Judger for checking out the system. I am glad it was 70% success for you guys. How did you test it. Did you create EA and tested it on Strategy tester. If so can you send the EA to me or put it here. thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi ES Trader, no EA, I tested it yesterday on the simulator, I will give it another try today. I tested your strategy on 1H time frame (GBP/USD). Will try EUR/USD today.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi all again,I have tested with simulator i hate to say that but we have consider about the money management for this system http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...8&amp;d=1203349357 Thank You Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #55 ---
@ES Please explain what the indicators bulls and bears are doing. (Is e.g. bulls simply counting the number of bars that close higher than they open?)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
hmm just by accident i loaded the bears bulls indi and have the ALF filter on my chart... (the blue line) this indi seems to work almoust like the ALF filter there is a litle bit diffrence but when i look at chatrts alf looks better;p check it out Inserted Code Adaptive Laguerre Filter - an indicator created by John Ehlers (www.mesasoftware.com). It is a superior overbought/oversold tool. There is a free technical paper at Ehlers' website entitled "Time Warp Without Space Travel" which you may download if you really want to know the gory details. indi is coded by Lou G at his thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239353 regards

awaiting buy signal. hopefully it comes during day time,

--- 帖子 #58 ---
wish I knew how to write EA, so that i don't have to miss trades !!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
ES Trader, can you tell if you after taking a signal let it run until a tp or sl, or if you take every signal??? Best regards, Orcinus

--- 帖子 #60 ---
orcinus, i take trade and stay for my 20 pips on 1 hr chart. sometimes i trade 4 hr chart ,then i stay for 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Nice, thank you! Are you having good results tonight? I'm busy trading 1/5 min charts today.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
This seems to be popping up in just about every thread on here, so here's how i fix it: if it downloads and shows "attachment.php" simply rename it (including the extension) to what it is supposed to be (the name.extension f the link you clicked.) FOR EXAMPLE. "attachment.php" would be renamed to (for example) "bulls.mq4" this works 100% of the time for me, just make sure you use the original name (bulls., bears., etc.) + extension (.zip, .tpl, .set,.ex4, .mq4, etc) Hope this helps some people as it a pain in the a** but has a simple solution that should work across all platforms. Cheers, boston

went long gbpusd at 4446 2 position. one closed at 20 pips plus, 2nd one closed at 4500. for 44 pips await sell sgnal next

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Can someone help me get an EA for this System. It should help many here. Thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
GBPUSD 1hr bar at 08:00 GMT (IBFX)shows higher bull number than bear bar. Gbp closed at 1.4446.it went as high as 1.4515. This system works if one can be patient and has the time to trade 1hr bar. Of course the results also seem to be quite good on 4 hr bar.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Iamboston, thanks for the help with downloading the indicators.

went short GBPUSD at 1.4470 I hr bar turned bearish. Let see what happens

--- 帖子 #70 ---
here is the trade I took

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Reversed trade at 4475 took 3 pip loss. out at 1.4500 . Net plus 22 pips

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi guys, I have been trading this system on the simulator with pretty good success. However I have added another indicator, CCI(14) and I get even better results, because I was able to filter out some false signals (see picture attached). Take short trades only when Bears value is greater than Bulls value and CCI is NEGATIVE . Take long trades only when Bulls value is greater than Bears value and CCI is POSITIVE . What do you think?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
thanks fguru I will try it

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I love testing these simple systems. One just needs to fit a person's style of trading, of course. Ronald, is there the plan to produce an EA for this ??

--- 帖子 #75 ---
hi freddyfx, Glad u like Simple systems. Ron feels this is not a system since there is no exit point and hence No EA can be created. I am not sure what he means by that. I did give my exit criteria in earlier post. Lets hope some one will help with EA.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
No exit criteria other than a TP which is significantly smaller than a SL. There was no provision for re-entry. Do I wait for another signal in the same direction or do I wait for a signal in the opposite direction?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Just a matter of time till we get blessed with a trader that has the time and the knowledge to program this. Seems to me you have better results trading this system when there is more activity then around this time in the market, right?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Ronald. I see you online. Please help here, you are the expert in this stuff and speak programming language like I speak Dutch.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
hi ron, let me summarize again. Go long when bull number is larger than bear number and vice versa. Once in the trade put target of 20 pips on 1 hr chart and 50 pips on 4 hr chart. Once exit, wait for opposite signal. Of course target profit , Stop loss can be customized depending upon individuals tolerance. or if you have some other ideas for money management, that will be great as well. thanks again

--- 帖子 #80 ---
No, I have had no problem in trading even around this time when activity is low. You may have to trade in the opposite direction and belove me new signal generates enough profit to cover the loss. In-fact if you look at my post above i did lose a trade of about 3 pips but I made 25 pips on the next opposite signal this evening.

Are not the bulls and bears indicators similar to absolute strength?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
ES trader I've give this method a go but I'm not sure about how you describe it. From what I can see the market can turn for quite a while for the bull/bear ratio to change in it's favour. Quite often you will get a high bull reading and a low bear reading but the 1hr bar will still go down. What I have found is when the trend changes you have to wait 2 or 3 bars for the bull/bear ratio to change to. However for that bar -when the bull/bear ratio FIRST changes with in the trends direction- the strategy works, but then the next bar is anyone's guest again, that is until the trend changes again then the bull/bear catches. hope this makes sense. When you see the bull/bear change do you just stay in the trade regardless of the price/bars moving up and down? or do you exit on the same bar you entered on? cheers.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I think it is the same as absolute strength, attached.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Missed a trade 08:00 Gmt. Bear number77 and bull number 39. Short Gbpusd at 1.4446 Went as low as 4371. This is why we need an EA to succeed in this system.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi ES Trader, I started trying your simple system today and am amazed at the result so far. The idea is to come to your pc every hour to make 20 pips or loose 20 pips or more. From about 8:00 uk time, I have made 6 trades with 5 wins and 1 loser. Not bad for a day even if i stop at that using the 1hr for cable. An ea will be cool...i agree. I noticed that there may be sometime of loosing when trend is about to change. But lets keep testing. Total of +63 pips trading for 5 hrs without baby sitting the trades. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
hi es trader, 1.do you trade on news? 2. are you trade only on london session? 3. what is ur trading time ?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hello Ibuks, Seems you have traded every hourly candle. But going by ES Trader: "Go long when bull number is larger than bear number and vice versa. Once in the trade put target of 20 pips on 1 hr chart and 50 pips on 4 hr chart. Once exit, wait for opposite signal" So once your target of 20 pips is achieved, you have to wait for the opposite signal, not trade the immediate next candle. Then perhaps you will have very less number of losses. Am I right, ES Trader ?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Never knew that was the rule. I followed every hr that I remember. He gave option of 1hr (for 20 pips) or 4hr (for 50 pis). Maybe I misunderstoop ES Trader. Anyway, just lost my second trade.... all thanks to intervention...lol. There is a need to demo it properly and find the best time to take the trades.... I just felt that since am taking cable, London session will be fine. An EA will do better...lol. So its 5:2 (5 wins and 2 losses) with a total pip of 23 pips...my last trade was with 40 sl. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Yes, Trading Every bar eventually results in loss

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Buy may be coming on gbpusd.Watch and wait!!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
What do you use for stops on the 1 hr. and 4 hr.?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
FreddyFx, I just found out this Link for learning how to create an EA. May be we both can learn http://forums.babypips.com/forextown...eating-ea.html http://sufx.core.t3-ism.net/ExpertAd...ic.php?p=57825

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Guys, I send a PM to one guy on board who's creating EA's on the fly. Hopefully he got some spare time and get interesting in this system. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi ES Trader, did you pay attention to the CCI value like I suggested yesterday?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks Skyzerfx

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yes, When I back tested, CCI filter seem to either miss or delay the signal.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
can i use this system on TF 5M?? and at pair EU....

--- 帖子 #99 ---
what about RVI to confirm?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I created an EA using Expert Advisor Builder. I am going to try and see whether it works.This is the first time I ever created an EA. Hence PLEASE DO NOT USE it on Live account. This may need some tinkering from experts here. Lets hope with everyones help here we can create a nice and profitable system Here is the EA

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks for your sistem I will try your expert

--- 帖子 #102 ---
i'm turning on machine and 2300 candle was bull. First bull reading after string of bears. This means I buy next bar open yes?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
long g/u 4476

--- 帖子 #104 ---
yes stifland

--- 帖子 #105 ---
EA did not initiate buy. Not sure why. Did manual trade

--- 帖子 #106 ---
roger that. i get it. so stop below 4417. TP of 20. Or reverse next candle if Bear number becomes bigger. Rinse and repeat

--- 帖子 #107 ---
ES Trader are you using 4hr chart? would it not be better using 1hr chart? Would have got in on last bar at 4424 (bulls 758/bears 288). Nicely over the ALF line too

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I am using 1 hr chart

--- 帖子 #109 ---
CST 19:00 bar closed at 4424, but on my chart it is showing bull 312 and bear 606 ( Ibfx). Hence did not go long, Next bar went bullish

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Yes stifland

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi how do you use the HA indicator in your template and how do you calculate your stop loss? I mean do you have a risk rewar ratio of 1.1, 20 stop loss and 20 take profit? Also I have another doubt, when a new canddle opens do you take the info about bears and bulls of the new canddle or the info of the last one which has closed? Regards

--- 帖子 #112 ---
ES Trader, I got reply from programmer: "Truth to tell, I could not work out which indi he is using. I see a bulls, and a bears, but his template appears to combine both. When I loaded the template onto a chart and consulted the data window, there was no mention of either bulls or bears. Unless ES can describe accurately in post 1 what he is doing, and what he is using to achieve this. I can see why RR has declined to get involved. Confusion reigns, and nobody can code an ea from that." See? You need to come up with clear explanation steps 1 by 1 What EA should look at, when to trigger and so on.. Guys just confused by what they see so far, that's why nobody involved in coding by now.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I may need to look further. May be I am not explaining it too well. Let me work on it for a while before I ask for EA Thanks anyhow for your help

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Attaching a helper indi using the builtin BullsPower and BearPower indicators. TF

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thanks , This helps a lot

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Great, thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
looks like reverse signal next bar,wait and see

--- 帖子 #118 ---
ES, Thanks for the effort on putting EA together but It's not making any trades. I'm going to leave it on my charts to see if it waits until Bull and Bear signal reverses to kick in.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi, Using the 7:00 Uk time candle, took a long since bulls were more than bear at the close of that candle. 20 pips in the bag on GU. ES, can u pls explain if we need to wait until there is an opposite signal b4 taking another trade or we can look at ever hourly close? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
personnaly I wouldn't go for hourly close as you still get a lot of down bars even when bulls in charge and vice versa. Get in on first change, get out with profit and wait for next change.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Out with another win for the day, 1 buy and 1 sell...now i wait for the change before taking the 3rd trade...which will be a buy..... Hope am getting it right now?? Cheers..

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thank you Es trader for this nice system.. I have a question ... i have understood the system but what about the money management ? 1) a Sl at the close of the previous candle ? but in this case what about the TP is the stop loss &gt;20 ? 2) a sl at 20 and a tp at 20 3) no stop loss but a reverse when an new signal go ? 4) a sl and tp at 2*atr(14) thank you for your answer.. bourseok PS : sorry for my bad english, i am french

--- 帖子 #123 ---
On Observation what I found is that it is better to quit at the close of the current candle and wait for the next signal. ( If the current candle does not get you the target profit of 20 pips).

--- 帖子 #124 ---
from what i've seen i agree with simple coder. If it shoots past +20 you could just let it run and move SL to +20.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
ES Trader, since you uploaded execs, are those indis from standard MT4 package?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
so if i understood correct, the rules are: when a new candle opens, buy if MathAbs(Bulls) &gt; MathAbs(Bears) and vice versa?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Yes, but trading every candle will lead to loss eventually, need another condition, Indy.. + bulls/bears

--- 帖子 #128 ---
yeah, may be ... on top of that, not all the candles have enough room for even 20 pips tp, as by the 7th before Tokyo open

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Right but, if we can scalp even 5 pips from 1h candle, that would be great

--- 帖子 #130 ---
i dont really see much opportunity in H1 - 6 and 7 GMT by 8th are both in loss even with CCI ... to cover those losses need to use trailing stop at least

--- 帖子 #131 ---
WOW! G/U Long from 4458, On a change to bull bar

--- 帖子 #132 ---
One possible money management could be to stop at the low/high of the previous signal and using trailing stop. That is what I did last trade. up about 130 pips

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Does this mean that trades are to be taken only on the (first) reversal bar? Also if a reversal bar itself resumes the previous direction, do we come out of the trade within the same bar? (Assuming that SL/TPs has not reached for the trade when the previous direction resumes). TF

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hello ES Trader Appreciate your generosity sharing your experience with others. I thought to share one indicator that could be used as StopLoss or TrailingStop. This indicator I found on FF website. Hope it helps Regards ForexZAK

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks Forexzak. I will check it out

--- 帖子 #136 ---
went long GU 4546

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I do not see this to be a reversal bar, which answers my question in my previous post that it need not be a reversal bar. Now for this entry, the previous many bar have been bull, what made you select this bar? Thanks TF

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Brothers, My first post.. This seems to be promising technique. Thanks Es_Trader for sharing your knowledge. This will not just help you in taking this piece to next level but also let others benefit from this. My results so far on this are two positive trades. In this session I missed couple of entries out of which one would have lost and one would have been a big winner. I have attached the screenshot with two possible entries from last few hours. Keep the coordination ON and we all can achieve something great. Cheers, Omar

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Going by the rules today would have earned us 50 pips approx at 00GMT candle and 01GMT candle of IBFX

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I guess I really need some help in understanding.. things seems simple yet too complex for me because of some updates? heheh Can I request ES_Trader to kindly update all new useful developments in the first post? Especially the indicators being used. I love the simplicity of the idea, but I cant seem to grasp it... reading through all the pages again for the 3rd time ... Btw, you mentioned "trading all bars will result in a loss"? How do we filter or trade the good bars please? Again, kudos for sharing this!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
good system, but one gets some false signals. using CCI as help on that. if bull has increasing CCI value from one candle to the next, and the third candle shows bear, it appears to be a false signal (same for bear)...look for retracement. I take the trades when for example, the CCI is bull, but the CCI value has been declining for several candles, and then switches to bear. after the first bear closes, good time for a trade. thanks EStrader

Doesn't this chart look great. Since 6/9 system made 4 trades( 2 days) 3 positive and 1 loss Total pips +91 -31 +216 +89

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi ES, What criteria are you using for exits? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi losingtrades, I do the same, I always check the CCI value, it helps to filter false signals.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Question pls: Do you ENTER at the open of "b" or at the opening of the next candle? http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/750/forexd1.jpg

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Open of the bar immediately after the signal change

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thanks, you mean at the bar a, when it opens? Doesn't it repaints as time progresses? So we wait for the current bar to close first, right? Or do you mean at the open of bar b? Sorry, still learning and a bit confused at the proper entry.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi ES and all you kind folks out there. Thanks for sharing this system which seems to look simple enough. I just got to read on this system while trying to find a post which I saw some time back about trading by doubling the lot size on the next trade (up to 4x). And there are a lot of similarity between the 2 systems. Since its not a trading day today, I was not able to try out the system you have explained. Will give it a try next monday.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
i think you need this with your indi if USD WEEK GBP STRONG go long if USD STRONG GBP WEEK go short

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Doubling up will be too scary. How about using the fibonacci series in opening the number of lots. That way you need to win 2 consecutive wins only and you win the "series"

--- 帖子 #151 ---
ES thanks for sharing. I have a suggestion to make that I believe would help everyone out if someone would be nice enough to code it. Could someone take the bull bear helper indicator and turn it into an ARROW up on the graph pointing in the direction of the signal. Of course you would only put an arrow up on a CHANGE in direction which I believe would help everyone here out. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Great Idea

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Can you please tell me what are these indictors use? to predict these values? i want to know how the values are calculated? thanks

--- 帖子 #154 ---
hello Tgalal please send your indi for week / strong it will help us Thank you

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Guys by adding the bulls and bears indicator in to your charts will not give you a signal, it is only a confirmation for an entry. You as a trader have to analyze the market by finding the support and resistance lines, once you have the lines and when prices is at those line then it is a signal. Now you can use the bulls and bears indicators for a confirmation of the entry. So for example the price retraced to a resistance line and this is a signal that the price might go down and make some nice moves to make a LL, wait for the bears to take control and then take a short. If you want to see a chart I can show you.

Turned out to be a good one! Even though I was late to jump-in. But can you explain what made you go for this trade? Bull had turned greater than Bear couple of bars ago and plenty of upside movement was already completed so why an open trade at this specific point? Peace, Omar

--- 帖子 #158 ---
out at 4703. Another + 100 pips Now wait for a change Bull/bear status

--- 帖子 #159 ---
ES...thanks for a great simple system. Are you using more than one time frame for confirmation b4 you place an order or do you only enter a trade when going in the same direction as long term weekly? thanks jacob

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I usually just concentrate on 1 hr. Of course If 4hr chart and daily chart is opposite of 1 hr signal I try to take smaller profit.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
thanks...also, do you enter a market trade at the end of the switch candle or a sell/buy stop and wait a few pips to confirm trend? I have a tendency to wait a few pips for confirmation and I think I leave money out there, but then again, someone buying it from me needs to make money also. I did not realize market trade was as popular as it is. thanks and keep it up man. jacob

I enter a market order. This system has so far done pretty good. But I am unable to get anyone o help in creating an EA !!. May be someday......

--- 帖子 #163 ---
May be clearing up some questions can help create an EA. 1. When exactly you look for new trade ? At the beginning of every candle do you see if there is bull vs bear cross and take an order? Is there any other filter you apply?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
no other filter

--- 帖子 #165 ---
today i enter after after bull or bear comformation but has been trap by side way, anyone help me to fitler it.i hav lose 2 order on today for tis system.....

How it Works Let say we SELL 0.1 Lot and set the martingale level at 25. The market goes up and we got -25 so we open new SELL 0.2 lot. Then if the market still goes up and the second order is -25 then close all order and open new BUY 0.7 lot. Then if market goes down reach -25, we open new BUY 0.8 lot. Then if market goes up and we have +25, we close all order. Set Stoploss 25, Takeprofit 25 Lot 1 = 1 lot Lot2 = 2 lot Lot 3 = 7 lot Lot 4 = 8 lot Lot 5 = 31 lot Lot 6 = 32 lot Lot 7 = 127 lot lot 8 = 128 lot and so on. it also can be 1,1,4,4,16,16,32,32,64,64... We can start either BUY or SELL and the lot open will follow. We have to choose the best martingale level depending on which currencies we traded. Thanks

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Nice NuCom, but a bit too steep too fast! How about Fibonacci series ala Martingale? The idea works like this, the Fibo series as we all know is 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 etc In the money management, we are only interested in the first 7-8 series and treat them as number of lots. And the TP and SL should be constant, say at 30 pips per trade. The idea is to win at least 2 consecutive wins, in any series of 8 trades. Everytime we lost, we move one series to the right, and everytime we won, we move one series to the left, until we reach the first digit. We will continue to use that 1 unit, until we lost. Each time we win 2 consecutive trades, we reset and start the number series all over again. We can also have the option to reset, everytime we have positive win overall. Losing trades are something we can neveravoid. But I guess with our high probability entries, it should not be seldom that we can win 2 consecutive wins in any span of 8 trades right? Much like a double up theory, but this one is "tamer." Sample, 1st trade - 1usd per pip, you lost. -50usd 2nd trade - 1usd per pip, you lost, -100usd now 3rd trade - 2usd per pip, you lost, -200usd now 4th trade - 3usd per pip, lost again, -350usd now 5th trade - 5usd per pip, you won, -100usd now 6th trade - 3usd per pip, won again, 50usd POSITIVE, repeat series What do you guys think?

Bears Helper is a great indicator. ES has a great system here. Can any of our talented programmers place an alert function on the Bears Helper indicator?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
man, this is a great system...just look at UJ the last 2 days great opportunity for an EA also. some parameters could be the following (please chime in and let's keep it simple) for going long 1...3 consecutive bear candles with decreasing bear values + 3 consecutive candles (same candles) with increasing CCI values (cci helps with false entries) 2...4th candle switches to bull and CCI becomes positive 3...go long on open of 5th candle 4...maybe a parameter to ignore very large 5th candles reverse for going short any ideas?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Just be careful with bears bull helper. I think there is a small problem I want to make sure it reflects the parameters I have been using on Bear and Bull power indicator they are Bull Power Period 14 Apply to Low Bear Power Period14 Apply to High

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Great Ideas. But I have been just following my simple parameters I mentioned in the first few posts. I have been so far consistently profitable except for couple of trades on GU since it was not trending for a while. But I was able to make up the loss on reverse trades Hope it helps Thanks

--- 帖子 #176 ---
ES, its a shame that someone can't simply take your indicator and turn it into an ARROW on the graph like so many other simple indicators. I have seen this done for simple MA crosses, Stoch crosses, etc... All this would be is a Bull vs. Bear cross. Unfortunately I am clueless to how to program or I would do it myself.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Same here. I am clueless as well when it comes to EA and indicators. Its Ok. Let us use what we have and make pips..... I also have been looking at some subtle changes in bull bear indicator that gives you some clue when trend is likely to end or slow. I will post once I figure it out better. thanks again for every ones help here.

eurusd from 2300 wait for the bulls to get stronger and then take a long.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
usdchf the price is at 1.1335, look for the bears to get stronger between 1.1335 and 1.1350 area. This could be a short at the Asian session as we go to the london open.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Are you sure you are looking at 1 hr chart. Looks to me a sell may be coming Here is the chart

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Looks like Buy may be coming on EurChf Here is the chart

--- 帖子 #182 ---
it might be a sell too depends which way it goes we can take the trade accordingly, but because eurusd is making HH which gives me a long bias. But again it could be a sell too.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
OOPS, I forgot the chart

--- 帖子 #184 ---
i c what you are doing now, you are riding each waive with small or big pips depends on the waive as soon as the signal shows up. I only go to the direction of the bias. But again at the end using the same type of confirmation.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
definitely appears that a short is coming...7 straight bars with increasing CCI, and bears taking over... I dont like trading this time of day but may take a chance...will think about it.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
my bad

--- 帖子 #187 ---
short might be coming but watch out, looks like the price is opening above the daily pivot and the price could retest the pivot line and head up again, that is the long bias for the new day. So the pivot is at 1.2277, get in when ever the signal comes and get out with 15-30 pips. Just be careful that when entering the short trade the price has some room to the pivot line for a comfortable profit.

I had posted this indi. I also observed some problem with the indi. The bull and bear values shown do not refresh properly as the program lines for calling the values is not placed in the correct area. I however think that the green and red bars that appear are representing the current situation correctly. I am a "Copy and Paste" programmer and this is what I could come up with. I don't think that it is very difficult to improve this indi. Alerts and arrows at the point of reversal may need some extra programming effort, but I think that alerts and arrows are also not too difficult. Any half decent programmer should be able to do it all with ease. Any takers??? In the meanwhile, I have observed that the Indicator "Absolute Strength Histo" posted here also does a good job(Out of the box setting). TF

Hi ES, Often values change such that the hourly bar which converted from a buy to a sell may revert to a buy within the same bar. Appreciate if you could tell uf how you manage the situation if you have entered into a sell trade at the initial sell signal and the signal reverses on you within the same bar. Thanks TF

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Why did you close it? bulls are out numbered by the bears according to the indi. Nothing is sure yet. I am still on the trade, I will wait for the late asia and london open. Again it might retrace to retest the pivot line and then it might move down, if it breaks the pivot then it might go up, it is the same thing every new day.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
here is a screen, if you carefully look at the screen the bears are 12 and bulls are 5.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I've scanned all of the 14 pages so far and it looks like nobody touched on it.. Has anybody tried this with a shorter time frame, ie) 15 min? I wonder how well it would do during the more active London hours.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
if you don't have pentians then intra day 3-5 hours trades would be the best for you. You have to find resistance and support and then use ES Trader's method for entries. There are many ways to find the res/sup lines. I am using the MAs. Some traders will use trend lines by connecting the points from LL to LHs or HH and HLs and draw the line to find where the market is trending, then trade only with the trend. The best is use higher time frames like 4hr or daily and then look for entries at 15min, 30min or 1hr, that is when pivot lines comes handy which gives you the map for the day. The only thing you should remember with pivot lines is that if price opens below that day then most likely the price will go down. If it opens above it then the price will move up for that day. Lets say the the price opened below the pivot line for the day. The 4 hr trend shows a down trend, wait for the price to retrace up to the pivot line or close to the pivot line then use ES Trader's mentioned indicators for entries. Sometimes the price will have a lot of momentum and will not retrace to test the pivot line and keep moving down but most days the price will test the pivot line. You need alot of patience, I had trades -150 pips and went to my favoure as long as you have analyzed your chart before the trade which will give you a trust.

ES Trader, Here is a BullBear Indi that i use but I have modified to use a LSMA instead of a simple EMA. This is just to show you that I can probably come up with a good trading tool for you. I am not implying that it should be used for your strategy. Just PM me ( ES TRADER ONLY ) with exactly what arrows and look that you want to see as a visual aid. Once this is set, I can build a backtester for you to test your strategy on different pairs, different period, and different timeframes. I worked on my own strategy using this on Renko Bars for about a month and did not come up with a viable system. Maybe something SIMPLE like this is a better approach. Just so you know, the Bear and bull indicator show the relative difference between the High(BULL) or Low(BEAR) and the particular MA that you use. My indi has a selection of EMA, T3, TEMA, and LSMA. They all have different attributes that may work. My personal goal is to come up with a scalper that will shave a few pips (say 4 - 10 ) after spread off of many trades. KingHigh

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I've been watching the Euro &amp; Pound this morning with this system with 15 min charts. Seems to work well if you don't mind being at your PC and taking smaller profits (10-15, maybe 20p -- what some would call scalps). The 'Bear Bull Helper' and CCI(14) filters help lots too. I'll see how it goes going forward..

--- 帖子 #213 ---
thanks for your input. Go for it!!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi everyone, Nice thread Here's an alert indicator I adapted from one that had other conditions. Incidentally, should anyone want to use the skeleton and change the indicator or iCustom calls in it, it's clear where this should be done in the code, thus making it extremely versatile for creating arrows and/or alerts and/or emails for any strategy. I have compared it to the "Bulls Bears Helper" and it displays the arrows in the same places as the BB Helper changes color. Hope that helps. ^ Chris ^

Did any one catch few great trades yesterday on GBPUSD, AUDUSD, EURCHF, NZD USD, and EURGBP. They all went up right after candle showed BULL BAR. I was able to get total of 200 pips. Could have gotten lot more if only someone could trade when I am asleep !!!. I still have hope some one can get an EA, But At least nqw we have a sound alert, thanks to one of the traders here. This system seems to be even better on 4 hr bar. Happy Trading!!

You're welcome. Just as an aside, out of interest I modified the arrows indicator to display an arrow if (Bulls&gt;0 &amp;&amp; Bears&gt;0) for buy and (Bulls&lt;0 &amp;&amp; Bears&lt;0) for sells. It looks quite good. But I don't want to distract from the thread. ^ Chris ^

I just found out that Arrows on your indicator seem to come BEFORE the bar is closed. I need to have it come AFTER BAR is closed and confirm that bear /Bull number has changed. Thanks

I have found indicators in some forums. alarm indicator is in the same place but I changed the name for ease of use. The idea of how to use is: Buy: Wait alarm, confirming that the line this up from 0, can be 0.25 to 0.50, this line should be in the direction upwards. Sell: Wait alarm, confirming that the line this fall from level 1, can be 0.75 to 0.50, this line should be in the direction down. This is just an idea, I am no expert. I'm trying to learn the art of trading in forex. Thanks ES

Hi ES, Any luck with the EA? I have always engaged the service of a programmer to write an EA for me. Over the past 2 months, i've already gotten them to write 2 EAs for me. Do PM me, we may be able to come up with something, i'm still a junior member and can't PM...not sure when i'll be upgraded to be a registered member....

--- 帖子 #233 ---
ES, No problem - the attached (new) version takes the closed bar, so it will now alert at the open of the new bar and not during the formation of the current bar. Should do what you want now ^ Chris ^

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks very much. Really appreciate your help. Did you check out another request above, possibly consider MTF Indicator for this system Thanks Again

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thanks for your input. I do believe EA would really help,, since many real good signals seem to come around Asian session when many in US are sleeping. Some of the really great programmers on this forum like Ronald Raygun and others do not believe this system can be programmed into an EA. May be some one can suggest some changes to the system without changing basic concept , may be we can get an EA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Indeed, i'm actually in Asia, so with an EA, likewise, entries can be made while we are asleep. I saw Ronald mentioned that there's an issue with your SL, i actually have 2 suggestions for that - 1. SL can be pre-set by the user, for example 40pips or 50pips, etc or 2. SL can be determined by the EA, take the lowest (for a Long Position) point from the last 2 candlestick or the highest (for a Short Position) point from the last 2 candlestick. Jay

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Sound fine with me. If Ea can be created by incorporating these parameters you mentioned it is fine. Hope he (Ron) can look into this Thanks

--- 帖子 #238 ---
yes...definitely. let's hope he'll read the post and could do something abt it. i'm all excited abt it. i'll be more than happy to help with parameter settings if needed. afterall, i had experience with talking to a programmer to write an EA.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Lets hope Ron or someone else will look into it. Eventhough initailly I thought 1hr chart was better , I have found higher time frame like 4 hr seem to make even more pips. I also have been using Damiani filter to avoid trading during ranging or Non Trending time .

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Please enlighten me...what is a Damiani filter? And how it works?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
This link is a good source of information. This indicator seems to keep you out of trades during ranging time http://www.forexforums.org/mt4-indic...olatmeter.html

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Mtf indicators generally are not stable until the end of the bar is longer. for example in the graph of an hour, with an indicator of 4 hours, expect to close the bar for four hours to one hour the signal is stable, not a bug, however we must be careful that in the past looks good, but by working online can cause false impressions. In this case an indicator modify and adapt it to your system. This system gives the signal in real time, without delay, what you see in the display is going on all graphs of different times. The trouble is that we can not go to the past. I will try to change someone else to do that. Thank you. pd. attach the two indicators to operate the detector. question of names. I'm not a programmer, but do my best.

ES, with the Damiani filter, and according to the grey and green line rule, the Short Position 6hrs ago on the GBP/USD shouldn't have been an entry? Did i interpret it correctly? Jay

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Take a look at this 4 Hr chart. Since 6/4 /10 If all signals were taken one could have made 157 pips ,just by reversing the trades My be not much but also lot less stress , since it is 4 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
You are absolutely right. I did get out of my short for small profit

--- 帖子 #249 ---
This may be another reason trading off of 4 hr chart may be better than 1 hr chart

--- 帖子 #250 ---
How did you come up with the 157pips? and what do u mean by reversing the trades?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I am sorry. When I said reversing the trade I did not mean just following the arrows on the chart. Take signal as u see on the chart( From Arrows as shown) and exit at the change of trend as indicated by Heiken ashi.

ES Trader, I am a fan of colouring my candles based on certain conditions. I have been playing with your simple system and created a potential H4 system based on Bull/Bear and the ALF Line. You don't need the indicator window below the chart. I left it there so you can see that the candles are coloured correctly. The candles are coloured as: BLUE: Bulls&gt;Bears and up candle (STRONG UP) Tomato: Bulls&gt;Bears but down candle (WEAK or retrace) Red: Bears &gt; Bulls and down candle (Strong down) Dodger Blue : Bears &gt; Bulls but up candle (weak or retrace) Long: Enter few pips above high of blue candle that closes above ALF Line Short: Enter few pips below low of RED candle that closes below ALF Line Use SL of 75 pips. Take half off at 75 pips and move SL to BE. ALF LINE can be found at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239353 http://i47.tinypic.com/14y7rjt.png

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thanks Flyer, Looks quite interesting. I will take a look at it this weekend. Thanks

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Can you please post the template/Indicator here. thanks

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Sorry, knew there was something I forgot to do. This is for H4 although I am sure other timeframes could work. I have other indicators such as Price Action patterns etc that i typically put on it as well but I thought that the most simple one using the Bull/Bear candles and ALF would be best to analyse. I have candle size set to 3 but you have to change this based on the zoom level you are at.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #259 ---
On colouring candles based on conditions you can have as many conditions as you want. the max number of colours that can be created are 4 as there are only 8 buffers to work with and you need 2 buffers per colour. I have stretched this to 6 colours by having default buffers as well where no colouring occurs. therefore the two other colours would be what ever you set in the properties tab of the chart. In this case it is a simple binary of Bull or Bear coupled with Up or down candle so only four conditions can exist.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Flyer, I dont see the Red and Vertical green lines for Sell/Buy on the chart. Do you know why?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I think there are ways to configure your system, there are good ideas here. A good idea would be, working in graphic than an hour, but seeing the above time frame in the drawing, this in an hour, the indicators in one hour and four hours. As we can see at a glance there are many opportunities to enter.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
**** As i mentioned in a post several days back, EA would be great (especially for those of us that have real jobs during the day and would get fired for trading during working hours) great opportunity for an EA also. some parameters could be the following (please chime in and let's keep it simple) for going long 1...3 consecutive bear candles with decreasing bear values + 3 consecutive candles (same candles) with increasing CCI values (cci helps with false entries) 2...4th candle switches to bull and CCI becomes positive 3...go long on open of 5th candle 4...maybe a parameter to ignore very large 5th candles reverse for going short

If you want you can attach the arrow indicator that was created earlier but that just shows when red changes to blue or vice versa. It would be easy enough to create an arrow that shows when the first blue candle closes above the ALF line or the first red candle closes below the ALF line but I did not do so. Your system was called "simple" so this is the cleanest i can make it. So again, just look for the first blue candle that closes above or the first red candle that closes below.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Also check it out on daily. Use a SL of 100 pips. remember to enter a few pips above high of setup candle on Long and few pips below low of setup candle on short. This will keep you out of some potential bad trades. Even entering pending trades you can see that this can work. Note that i looked at EU only for this.

ES Trader, thank you for this great system! I like Vicente's new MTF indicators, but I did it differently. I'm not a programmer, I just took some MTF indicator and changed several lines of the code. So, if there is any bug, I probably won't be able to fix it. But indicator seems to work just fine, I did some testing, compared it with BullBearHelper - everything looks good. My MTF indicator shows four bars. For example on M-1 it shows M-1, M-5, M-15 and M-30, on M-15 it shows M-15, M-30, H-1 and H-4. P.S. If you don't like the colors, you can change them, for example, from green to blue and from white to red.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Fokusnik, I just put your indicator up on my candles template. Awesome. It would have kept me out of a few losing H4 trades i had taken and also provided me with some that i missed. Great mtf indicator. I even went at it on M15 and I was really impressed at how this system shows the trades. ES Trader....great and simple system.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi, how does one use the MTF? I mean in relation to this simple system? When in m15, how does one interpret what the H1 or m5 BBH do? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thanks! I am a fan of LouG's ALF too ... nice to see how you incorporate the 2 simple systems. But, I think over at LouG's ALF thread, it seems like ALF works best on m15 and m5 timeframes? This is H4 timeframe right? I see you suggested the SL, how about your TP?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I find the ALF works well on H4 and I believe that Pip??? uses it on H4 as well. If you take off half at 1R then you can let the other half ride until Price Action tells you to take it off or it hits the ALF Line again. If I use an actual TP then I look for round numbers or support/resistance as my target. You can just keep moving your SL up by using techniques such as S/R, 2 bar trailing or trailing by 1R etc (whatever you typically use).

--- 帖子 #270 ---
iamnoel, How I used it was to again look at the ALF line and current timeframe Bull/Bear. If the other timeframes were the same colour as the chart timeframe then that implied more support and momentum for my trade. have a look at the charts. http://i48.tinypic.com/334nm7c.png http://i45.tinypic.com/2vkz2xk.jpg

--- 帖子 #271 ---
This is an example of why I like to enter a few pips beyond set up candle. Learned this from jtrade and it has saved me in the past. http://i46.tinypic.com/i3b1hl.png

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi I am trying to use mtf indicator but the color of the boxes are green in all time frames .I am sure it is something simple I have to do

--- 帖子 #273 ---
harar, I put it on the same chart and no problems. Note my settings for the indicator. Also, as this is the weekend and you are not getting any tick data you may have to hit the refresh button under Charts-Refresh. Also, you will need to have had the history for the other timeframes (in this case m30, H1 and H4) loaded so it can calculate the indicator. Just go through the 4 timeframes and hit the Home key to make sure you have the historical data. http://i47.tinypic.com/15whxnc.png

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Flyer415 Thank you for your help. I have the same settings of the indicator and I tried every thing you suggested but it did not work. Can you do me a favor, can post your template may be it will work Cheers

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Woh! Just came back from work after night call and I find all these fantastic iindicators for this system. Thanks flyer415, and Fokusnik. The MTF looks fabulous.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I have the same problem as harar, it shows only green dots.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
looks like a good idea.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
here is my tpl but i think it is a data issue.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I am not an EA trader at all. i use them to manage trades at times and they are very good for this. if you were looking at an EA for this then i would think to use the latest MTF indicator as the trigger. Example: You can use 2 dot or 3 dot confirmation technique. You could have a filter to enter only in direction of highest timeframe dot. int Variables --- 2, 3 or 4 dot confirmation bool variable ---- enter in direction of high timeframe only The bool variable would result in fewer trades but no counter-trend trades. EX: Long Enter on close of candle where 2nd green dot comes in. Exit when lowest timeframe dot becomes red. Note: You could use the ALF in the EA or not. This type of EA can be coded as it has distinct events.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks Flyer415.As you said , It did not work. I guess I have to wait till market opens

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Keep Talking. You are making lot of sense. Is it possible you could try to create an EA. We could see whether it works. Any how no one is going to try it on Live account until all the bugs are removed.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
For now may be we could keep Alf out since we are trying not to loose simplicity of the system too much. Lets try as few variable as possible.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
No problem with ALF out. I code a lot but I would never code a trading EA for someone. I suggest that since the MTF indicator now exists that you create a series of entry and exit rules. Once you have those created then i am sure that RR or someone else will be willing to code it. If you look at most of RR posts you will see that he refuses (properly so) to code EAs that have no clear entry/exit points and no MM rules. The other issue that you will have is that as in a lot of threads this will denigrate to a EA building thread and the thread itself will die as a result. WHy not create another thread and call it EA Rules for ES Trader's simple system. In your initial post refer people to this thread for an overview and history. have the second thread only for EA suggestions and put it in the Platform Tech forum where it will be seen by EA coders. If people in this thread attempt to post EA suggestions then refer them with a link to the second thread. That way true trading development occurs here while programming development occurs elsewhere. It gets rather annoying in a trading system thread to always hear about minor programming issues that have no bearing at all on the trading methodology itself. Just a suggestion...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
ES Trader, flyer415 - thank you very much for your good words! harar and fguru - sorry for the inconvenience. Guys, I think I know what happened. We have two Helper indicators here: 1). Bull Bear Helper.mq4 2). BullBearHelper.mq4 My MTF indicator uses the second one, BullBearHelper.mq4 So, please download it, put it in the indicator's folder and restart the Metatrader.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Another interesting thing I have been noticing on the Bull Brear Indicator. For Eg When you see Long Green Bull bar ( almost like an exhaust bar) the trend seems to come to an end. ( of course there may may few more pips one may leave on the table). Similarly when one sees a long red bar short seems to come to an end. Not sure whether it is of any significance. Thought I will throw it out here to see whether one can use it in trading especially for exit.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Guys, I think we can take a look at Steinitz' threads. I think entry and exit rules for his MTF indicator are almost universal and we can use some of them (just my two cents). But of course it is ES trader's decision, it is HIS system!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Sounds Good. I will definitely look into it.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Finally I managed to get it to work. I re downloaded "BullBearHelper" indicator from the paperclip attachment posted 18th june.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I was looking at the MTF you created. I find there is some problem. For eg as you can see on the chart (60 min) top line should be Green at ARROW. The bar turns bullish and hence needs to be green It is showing red. Not sure Why

--- 帖子 #290 ---
VERY IMPORTANT!!! You have to read bars from the bottom to the top! On H-1 the bottom line is H-1, above it H-4, above it - D-1, above it W-1. (I believe flyer415 showed it on his pictures) As to the wrong color: MTF indicator uses BullBearHelper, so you have to compare it with the BullBearHelper, but on your picture there is no BullBearHelper, just different Bulls and Bear indicators and color candles. If you put BullBearHelper on this chart, you'll see that the BOTTOM mtf bar shows the same color as BullBearHelper. So, if the BullBearHelper works right, then the MTF indicator works right, if the BullBearHelper doesn't work properly - then the MTF indicator doesn't work properly.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I am sorry. I looked at the wrong line. Thanks for pointing it out

--- 帖子 #292 ---
No, ES Trader, I'm sorry for not explaining everything clearly!

--- 帖子 #293 ---
you are welcome. Do you see how nice trades look when all 4 lines on MTF are of same color, Cant wait to try it out next week. Thank

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Do you think it is possible to get an arrow when all 4 time periods are in tandem with each other and also have audible alert. I know vicente did have an alert but I think it is for the current period Thanks

--- 帖子 #295 ---
ES Trader, I think a good professional programmer could do that, but unfortunately I'm not a programmer. I think we can go to the Steinitz' threads, and if there is such an alert/arrow indicator, we could change it a little bit for our MTF.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Me too, me too!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I m sorry to ask you. Is it possible you can try it. My knowledge of Computer is very limited. I am really sorry if I am bothering you too much. Thanks

--- 帖子 #298 ---
No bothering at all! I'm VERY interested myself! I went to the Steinitz' threads, but didn't find anything I could work with. If I find anywhere some MTF alert/arrow indicator I can change for our MTF, I will do it! So, I'm going to do some research, it is possible, that I can find something good on the other forums.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi guys, the MTF indicator works now, thanks for your help Fokusnik . However I tried to trade on the simulator and unfortunately the MTF indicator did always repaint the previous bars. So basically I waited until 3 bars get either red or green but there were always just 2 bars either red and green, so I waited and waited for the perfect signal, but when I looked back a few bars I saw that there were 3 bars either red or green. Sorry if this sounds strange, but I am afraid, the MTF indicator does not work properly.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Fokusnik, I modded your indicator to include arrows when all 4 timeframes align. Give it a try. No alert as I was in a rush but just add the alert code where I have the createobject stuff. As it is your original indicator just include this code and then give it a name that you want and re-post it. http://i50.tinypic.com/6qfqf8.png

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Ok..just modded it again so you can select if you want the arrow on 3 or 4 timeframes agreeing. If you select 3 then it will show an arrow if the lower 3 timeframes agree. Also you can select if you want Arrows or not. Note that if you enter anything but 3 or 4 it will pop an alert telling you to enter 3 or 4 and it will not show any data.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Ok..final edit. Now you can use 2 dots only. Note that 2 dots should only be used on H4 otherwise you will get too many arrows on m15.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Thank you very much Flyer415. Thanks also for Fokusnik for modifying the indicator. You guys are Great!!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
flyer415, thank you so very much! But I'm afraid only the first version of your indicator is perfect. I mean 4BARS-MTF-BBH with arrow.mq4 The second version doesn't show some of the good entrys on M-1, and the third version doesn't show arrows on the smaller timeframes from M-1 to M-30, it shows arrows on H-1 and bigger frames. I tested GBPUSD. So I added sound to the first version, it is impossible to test now, but I think I did it right, we'll see on Monday.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
fguru, I used to work with Steinitz' 4 bar MTF HAS and I can tell you that working live is not similar to the simulator, I worked with Steinitz 4 bar MTF HAS pretty easy and it was profitable, I didn't have any problems finding two or three dots aligned. These kind of "repainting" is natural. For example, you work on M-5. So, the bottom line is M-5, above that - M-15. On the M-15 the last dot can repaint during formation of the candle, and this repainting is OK, we all know, that the dot can change the color until the candle closed. But what happens on M-5? If the last dot on M-15 repainted before closing, then the last three dots in the second bar (M-15 bar) on the M-5 will change too! Why 3? Because 15=5*3 ! And, of course, on the bigger timeframes dots change color very seldom, there is a huge difference between M-5 and H-1 or H-4. And as I said, when you work alive even Steinitz' system is profitable, but BullBearHelper's signals are MUCH faster and MUCH more reliable than Steinitz' HAS signals, so on Monday we're gonna really kick some behinds!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
That makes absolute sense to me, Fokusnik. I forgot that MTF trading with the simulator doesnt work. I am eager to test it out on monday/sunday night. So which of the MTF indicators, that were posted, do you recommend?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Try using the "timeframe" parameter of The BullBear helper. Attach it as many times as the time periods you want. 5/15/30/60/240.... It will however be prone to the various MTF indicator issues. TF

--- 帖子 #308 ---
The last one, 4BARS-MTF-BBH with ALERT-1.mq4

--- 帖子 #309 ---
That's great, thanks!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
refer this thread on bull and bear system http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=146591

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Fokusnik, The other versions work. The arrows are most likely off the chart as they are a fixed pip distance away. i had set it up for H4 so it would be verrrrryyyy far away in M1 or other low timeframes. Try it again and set the Arrowgap to 20 instead of 200 and you will see them. i should use an ATR function to set the arrow distance but i did not do so. this can be done later tonight.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi, Attaching an EA to trade using the bull and bear indicators in MT4. You can use the EA on any time frame as the time frames to be used is hard coded. I have a skeleton EA which I use to try out simple strategies. This skeleton has developed over time with the help of the great guys at one of the yahoo mt forum, very specifically Robert Hill. There was also another programmer who corrected an important part of the code, unfortunately I do not recall the name. As I am essentially a "copy and paste" guy, I cannot offer any further support or improvements to the coding. As such I have used the word "helper" in naming the EA. Carry out the necessary due diligence before trying your luck trading this EA live. The various parameters in the EA are quite apparent. The quantity 0.01 used for the parameter "DonotCloseQty" is important and necessary so that the EA does not immediately open a trade in the same direction once it has closed a trade. This could happen if the trading conditions are being met even after a trade in that direction has been closed. Thus avoiding trades at probable turning points after a successful run. I could not program any other way. Although I am very happy with the skeleton EA handling ES traders strategy quite well, I fail to understand why any good programmer is not taking up such an easy task. As mentioned in my earlier post, programming this system will be very easy for any half decent programmer. In the meanwhile, enjoy this EA. Try the out of the box (OOTB) setting on GBPUSD. Strategy tester gives good results for the year 2010. TF

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Fokusnik, here is version 4. I put an arrow distance calculation in it based on ATR(14) and i checked it on M1 all the way up to D1. the arrows stay in the screen the whole time as it automatically adjusts.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Whew, nice nice posts and indicators! I have a problem though, my MTF still shows ALL GREEN? Do I have to click the ALLOW DLL INPUT in the COMMON TAB? Screen shot.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
flyer415, that's great! Thank you very much! I believe this your version is absolutely perfect! I added the sound signal to it. It is impossible to test the sound signal right now, but I hope I did it right. At any case, your arrows work great. So, guys, here is the final version (I hope the sound works good, we'll see it on Monday. If I screwed sound up - I do apologize, I'm not a programmer, just a "copy and paste guy") So, please download the final version. Please remember: 1). You have to read bars from the bottom to the top, the BOTTOM bar shows the current timeframe 2). In order your MTF indicator work you have to have BullBearHelper in your indicators folder. You don't have to put it on the chart, just download it, otherwise you will see all red dots or all green dots.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Finally, got it to work now, thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I have a question. Kindly refer to the chart I posted. As I am visually testing this charts, I noticed this (boxed in red). In those cases, I would have opened a trade, seeing the ALL GREEN, and the PA closed above ALF, but, the PA reversed? We just take the 20pip SL, and moved on to the next signal?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
iamnoel, I think in your first "box" we can see a VERY late entry! We should enter ten hours earlier, at 1:45! As you can see, we had 3 red dots in the bottom bar and two red dots in the M-30 bar right before 1:45, so that would be a very good, solid entry and we would get more than 100 pips. And there is another thing, another "mistake". (Of course, we all hope that ES Trader will create some rules for our MTF indicator, but since we don't have the BBH-MTF rules right now, I would use some Steinitz rules). And according to Steinitz you'd better not enter long if you have just a couple of red dots in the bottom bar and no red dots in the bar above. The trade in your second "box" is late too. We don't have to wait until 4 dots align, according to Steinitz we take a trade when two dots align, and if we take a trade when just two dots align (the first candle in your box), we would make some very nice profit, something around 50 pips, which is very good for M-15 timeframe. So, if we have 2 blue dots align (after several aligned red dots), we don't have to wait until 3-4 blue dots align. If 4 blue dots align all of a sudden after several aligned red dots - that is great, we know, that it's gonna be a great trade. But if we can see 2 blue dots align after several aligned red dots - we'd better not wait for a perfect trade (because it's possible we'll wait too long), we'd better take this trade and take some decent profit IMHO.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
What do you guys think, how could we avoid this false signal (see picture)?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
two ways that signal would not have been used. remember that it is your setup bar. Put the trade on a few pips beyond the setup bar and you can see that a long never would have executed. More importantly though you can see that it is a negative pinbar which would tell you from price action studies that price was going down. Therefore price action would say not to take it. In fact PA would say go short. in all signals price action is king and you have to use that to get in and out.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
What is the logic behind this system? If the absolute bulls number is greater than the absolute bears number, but BOTH numbers are negative, why would that imply a bullish bias? What is the logic behind such a claim?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
flyer...great point about a few pips above high or low to enter. Also, in most cases, a large bar overwhelming bigger than previous bars is almost a sure sign of reversal. I also cannot see any CCI values. This could tell about false signals Jacob

--- 帖子 #328 ---
GOOD Morning. Hi Fguru, In my humble opinion, short term charts anything below 1 hr is likely to give many False signals. Lets be frank, How many of us are going to sit in front of a computer watching every minute. These are the traders probably brokers love to trade against since price can be easily manipulated at few minute intervals rather than long term like 1hr or 4 hr.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
fguru, I totally agree with ES Trader. When I started using Steinitz MTF HAS, at first I did everything he recommended and worked on M-15 and even M-5, but I kept getting too many false signals so I switched to H-1 and it was good, I never went back to the smaller frames. For any MTF the bigger the timeframe - the more reliable signals! If you go with this trade you show to the H-1 you will see that H-1 has a bunch of red dots in the bottom bar and all blue dots in the bar above, so on H-1 you wouldn't trade at all at this time. And another thing: several pages ago Damiani volatmeter has been recommended. I understand that all of us want to keep our system as simple as possible and not to add a whole bunch of indicators, but we REALLY have to avoid trading during flat market, and in my opinion this Damiani volatmeter is exactly what we need. If you go at the time of this trade to H-1 and put Damiani volatmeter you'll see that it shows flat.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I only trade in the direction of larger timeframes (1H, 4H), however the positive bull signal did also appear on 1H AND 4H. And the pin bar was formed only when the candle closed, but it opened bullish. Still I wont use the MTF indicator on 1H time frame since it would show me the time frames 1H, 4H, Daily and Weekly only, I however prefer to trade 1H time frame but check also the smaller time frames (e.g. 15M for entry). Do we enter into a trade when we get a signal during the candle forms or only after it closed?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Only AFTER the bar closed. That is the only way you will be able to see the change in the BULL/BEAR number, which is the basis for this system

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I am testing the EA on strategy tester, 4 hr chart gbp/jpy for last 15 months. No trades are showing up. Not sure why?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I am confused about the entry parameters you mentioned above. Can you please point them out and describe them clearly with a chart if possible Thanks

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I'm sorry, I'm so bad with the pictures! I couldn't even use the picture I was talking about. So I provided another picture, GBPUSD M-15 just to illustrate. In the first box we can see red dots aligned on the three levels and the red dots aligned for a little while, not just for 15 minutes, but for 30-45 minutes. The more levels and the more times we can see the red dots - the better, the long entry after that will be stronger. And we see that after this red dots' area the blue dots aligned on two levels - that is supposed to mean a good entry. So I would enter where I tried to draw an errow However with this entry we got into flat... That's why I was talking about Damiani as a flat filter. The second box showes even a better entry. As you can see, the red dots aligned on three levels and there are more red dots than in the first box, we're talking not 30-45 minutes like in the first box, but 60-75 minutes. And once again we're lucky, right after a whole bunch of the red dots the blue dots aligned on all four levels, so it is supposed to be a very good, solid entry. And this time we avoided the flat. So, if we enter at where I draw an errow, we would get 80+ pips, for GBPUSD on M-15 it's a pretty good profit. The third box shows the blue dots aligned on all four levels, and the blue dots started several hours ago. So, when we see the first red dots after such a long period of time, it could be a good short entry even if there is only two red dots aligned. So, I would enter where I draw an errow, after red dots aligned on just two levels. We would make another 80 pips. In a circle you can see just one blue dot. I wouldn't enter short after that. 1-3 blue dots on the bottom level and no blue dots on the above level don't mean a good short entry after that. So, I would say: 1). The more levels and the longer area of the red dots - the better, the long entry after that will be stronger. The same with the blue dots area and the short entry. 2). If blue dots align on just two levels right after the red dots' area - we can enter long, especially if that happened after a good, continuous red area (and vice versa). 3). If three or especially four dots aligned right after the "different color area" - it is supposed to be a very good, solid entry. But if that is not happening and we can see just two dots aligned - we'd better enter and not wait until 3-4 dots (we don't want to wait too long, the trend can lose the power) 4). 1-3 blue dots on the bottom level and no blue dots on the above level don't mean a good short entry after that (and vice versa) 5). We have to check with Damiani, it's better not enter during flat market.

Here, I modified an indicator, I wonder if anyone can help me by putting alerts when three arrows are in agreement, or some other idea for alarms. indicator is the idea that we can see from a single window, all the pairs. thanks

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Vicente, thank you very much! But I have a problem - when I tried to install your dashboard, it freezed my Metatrader. How do I install correctly ?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I have same problem Even though I delete the file, still my meta trader is freezing..

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Remember that you must use the indicator BullBearHelper. This board takes to load 1-3 minutes. Another way to make lighter the indicator is the number of periods. Besides this, the graph can not have more indicators. Only this. if still not working let me know.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Vicente, I tried again. I've been waiting for 10 minutes, the Metatrader doesn't respond. I have BullBearHelper and my chart doesn't contain any other indicators. I can't make the dashboard lighter because the Metatrader freezes immediately after I try to install the dashboard. So, I think it's not for me. Thank you anyway.

blablablabla.... in the mean time the guy of the method is still making a lot of pip !

Today, I have trades on various pairs on demo account. gbpjpy also had a sell (which closed at a loss). I also tried gbpjpy on strategy tester. The account being a new demo, there was only limited history. Trades were appearing for the limited days of history that was present. You donot have to attach the EA on any specific timeframe. Time frame to be used is hard coded and controlled by the parameters for the EA that you select for using. TF

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Good morning! Right now I can see only one problem with MTF BBH on H-1, but it's a BIG problem - the exit signals are very slow and unreliable! The entries are almost perfect. I trade GBPJPY, GBPUSD and EURJPY. Let's take a look at GBPJPY: 5 AM is a very good, solid entry - a long red area and after that three blue dots aligned. So I took a trade with stop-loss 60 and take-profit 100 and went to bed. And I got my 100 pips all right! But what if the trend changed earlier, at something like 80 pips? Let's say I don't go to bed and I wait for the exit signal. Even now H-1 chart doesn't show any exit signals! Maybe we can enter on H-1 and exit on M-15? How do you, guys, exit?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Good news! Our thread received more than 40,000 views!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Fokusnik, I don't trade H1 however....when I put a trade on and have to leave it unattended then i use an EA to monitor it for me. I put a hard SL of 1R (in your case 60 pips) and I put a hard TP of 2R (in your case 120). Note that the TP could be based on S/R etc. I then have the EA go to BE + spread at 1R(in your case 60 pips). Sometimes I will have it take partial profit at 1R but not always. Then I will jump trail or just leave the SL at BE. As for exiting based on M15...that is a conservative way of doing it and will allow you to bank money but you may lose out on a longer trend. On H1 and H4 i basically ignore the last two higher dots as they will never change in time so perhaps once in a trade just drop down to M15 and once you get M15 and M30 changed then exit??? Ideas only...

Went short on UJ @91.03. TP: 90.83 SL: 91.23 Just demo.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Really, Wow. May be someone start giving stars for this thread!! I took trade on AudUSD, NZDusd made total of 160pips. I trade only 4 hrs. For Exit I use couple of options 1. I wait fir the color to change on 1hr chart. 2. Sometimes i put fixed pip profit, usually between 50 t0 100 pips. 100 pips if ALL the 4 time zone is in tandem. If 3 are then 75 and if 2 then 50 pips

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Es Trader, can you tell me the price and time of your entries on NU and AU or post a chart. I picked up 50 pips on GJ this morning on M15 with a 20 pip SL. (on demo) Also just entered EU short on H4 (live). COuld have entered 25 pips earlier but wanted to break low of previous bar. H4 is red but not D1. W1 and MN1 is obviously red. I believe that on a higher strong downtrend that i can enter based on only the H4 going red but I could be wrong. thanks

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Here are the 2 charts. I was long from last week

--- 帖子 #352 ---
There has been no trade so far on EA. Any one has had luck with EA?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Thanks for that. i thought that you meant you entered last night or today. Now I get your entries on my charts as well. Love H4!!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
When u are trading 4 hrs,it seem to be ok even if one more level up is of same color. Seem to work out for at least 50 pips profit. Just my opinion of course

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I was really tempted to go short on UJ as it went below 91.23 which is the Month Open. Also had a pinbar that closed right at it on my h4 feed.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I concur. My issue lately on H4 has been exit strategies. i had 5 trades in a row that went to BE after being at least 75 pips in profit. More issue with the take profit strategy then the exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I have buy stop on UJ, Of course I will probably look for smaller profit since it is green only 0n 4hr time frame

--- 帖子 #358 ---
buy stop 91.50

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I agree. Entry seems pretty good so far with MTF indicator.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I still hope EA will trade. May be needs some work.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
91.50 will also break that downward sloping H4 trend line as well so looks like a good entry for buystop. Also outside the high of that pinbar. I was looking to see if the MTF dot will turn red on next candle and continue downwards.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Even though i am primarily a H4 live trader I have been trading demo on M15 lately. The MTF works very well there. I coupled it with ALF although i found the EMA 8 to be very good as well.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
But tempted to go short here. Except for 4 hr zone it is red on 1hr, day and week. I will go short here 91.95

--- 帖子 #364 ---
sorry 90.95

--- 帖子 #365 ---
looking for 20 pips Profit target

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Why dont you use trailing stops?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Es Trader, What type of candle indicator are you using? Is that HA?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I just trade live account. That gives you the real feel for trade. Even if one is good in demo, you don really experience the up and down emotional roller coaster as in live trade. Of course until I am comfortable, I just trade 0.01 contract

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Greed and fear... Fear gets me to move SL to BE (sometimes too fast). Greed gets me to keep it there so move has more room to grow. I do use a step trail sometimes. My idea is to go to BE at 1R. (Maybe take half off at 1R). Step SL by 1R every 1R. So with 75 pip SL I move to BE at 75 and move to 75 at 150. That means up to 149 pips I am only at BE. 5 trades in a row at BE tells me to change this and I am looking to do so but have not come up with a viable strategy yet. On M15 it seems so much easier. I use SL of 20, BE at 20, half off at 30 and trail 20.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I agree with you. But since I am trading live H4 I get the emotional side there. I never trade demo exclusively for the very reason you cited. M15 is a new timeframe (and faster) for me. I want to get used to that speed and entry conditions and then live on small numbers. Demo is helpful in working out the mechanics. For example, on h4 i have lots of time to think and put in pending order. On M15 I missed some good trades because I was not fast enough. i discovered that I should use hotkey entries on M15. Just a mechanical aid but i would not want to learn that live.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hello all, Just came across this tread. Instead of Bull/Bear power indicators and the consequently reading of the Datawindow, I use an indicator "Buyers-Sellers". If you look into the code , you'll see that it is based on bulls -bears. It' very visual, even indicating the strenght. I don't use it on its own, but as support to react on price action. Ideal for M5 scalping. I am not the creator, found it somewhere. Enjoy, Ludo

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Ludo, Not sure if you read the entire thread. No longer looking at the data window. Now use an MTF helper indicator that shows across 4 timeframes

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Looks interesting Can u send the link for the forum please thanks

Looks like sell may be coming on GU on 4hr chart. have to wait 61 minutes to close

Hi ES, The EA is wotking and is trading as per the parameter that it is set up for. I attached the EA with OOTB to various pairs and the EA has taken the trades as per the following basic setup: PowerPeriod = 14; Use_TimeFrame_M240 = true; Use_Close_of_bar_M240 = true; Use_TimeFrame_M60 = true; Use_Close_of_bar_M60 = true; Use_TimeFrame_M15 = true; Use_Close_of_bar_M15 = true; Use_Close_of_2_M15_bars = false; Use_TimeFrame_M5 = true; Use_Close_of_bar_M5 = true; Use_Close_of_2_M5_bars = true; Lots = 1.01; I am attaching the statement for the trades taken since opening of the market yesterday. Although, at present the net result is negative, at a point of time the combined result was positive 10%. (about $27,500 i.e $,2500 positive on a $25,000 account) The TP is set at 80 pips which was not reached for some pairs which then turned negative. As for not taking any trades on Strategy tester, as mentioned in my earlier post, it worked at my end. I am using FXDD Malta. Please try again, select the 5M timeframe on the tester period drop drown. The trades that will happen will still be based on the timeframe that you select in the parameters. Hope this helps. TF

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I will try it out again. I use IBFX. Dont know whether that is a problem. Thanks

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thanks for sharing this indicator, can you tell me please how to read the strenght indicator? Sometimes you can find buyers 200, sellers 94 and power -5, so how do you interpret power reading? Regards

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I found that the previous Version 4 of fokusnik's indicator would create arrows instantly and if at the Close the numbers had reversed then the arrow would remain. i modded this to create version 5 which gives an option to create arrows only on Close. So if AlertOnBarClose == true therefore arrows are only created after bar close and remain. If it == false then the arrow is created instantly and remains until the next bar is formed (I believe but this was tough to test). I attach it so fokusnik can mod it as he wishes.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I have been using the EA on the 4 hr TF, and it has put me in 2 profitable trades since yesterday. This s with the EUR/USD and GBP/USD , both short. I have only allowed the EA to trade the 4 hr only, and and have only 1 SL and TP. It seems okay re issuing alerts as well. A really great effort!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Can someone confirm a question for me regarding the EA. I am not an EA trader BUT....JoelD implied that it can issue signals without actually trading. Question: Can i load up the EA, run it, have it issue signals but not allow it to live trade. Will it be as effective? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
That,s Great. I still do not have any trade . I have an ac with IBFX. Who is your broker. I wonder whether having stealth stop loss is the problem. I had tried some of the EA.s in the past with stealth SL and Profit target. Ea did not work on IBFX. May be someone can help Thanks

--- 帖子 #383 ---
You just un click "Allow Live Trading" on Common tab of EA

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Sorry, I did not explain my self properly. i realize that i can stop it from trading. Some EAs trade without providing any output to the user. Does this EA provide a signal of some sort that I can then decide upon or does it trade without user output? Also if I use H4 timeframe will it only issue trading signals at every 4 hour candle close or can it be anytime. Sorry for the poorly worded question earlier. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Well, I decided i might as well find out for myself. I put the EA on 5 pairs with the default parameters. I am assuming that means that it will trade any and all timeframes. If it works then i will move it to H4 only.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
The EA took several trades in the past few minutes. However, I assume that the default parameters are set up for a 4 digit broker. They closed at 10 pips or so in profit and also at -7 pips. I turned off the EA, closed all trades manually, and changed the default parameters to reflect 5 digit broker by adding a 0 to each number. ALso set it to true on H4 only. Can someone confirm 4 digit vs 5 digit setting?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I am using IBFX with 4 digits, What I have found out is the EA will open a new trade with the .01 lot that is added on if you don't include this with the lot size you wish to trade. (this is after our trade has been closed.) Also It will open a trade on any chart that is part of the profile that you have open. I personally take over from the EA once it opens a trade, so I don't know if the stealth SL works or it would use a trailing stop?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
The EA does not work for 5 digit brokers. If you make manual adjustments like adding an extra zero, please confirm whether it behaves as you want it to. TO OTHER QUESTIONS: Stealth stop is a "stand alone" function and will not have any affect on the working of the EA when brokers are changed. The .01 quantity may be the reason for it not working on IBFX. The EA can be placed on any timeframe. Trades will happen according to the parameters used. Even if it is placed on the 1M chart, it could be trading on the 4H setup if the parameters have been setup to trade on the 4H time frame. TF

--- 帖子 #389 ---
The EA can be setup to use 4H, 4H close of Candle. There are also other parameters i.e 60M, 60M close, 15M, 5M. When all the required conditions are met, the EA will trade. Therefore it will trade at any point of the 4H candle and not necessirily at the open of th 4H candle. TF

--- 帖子 #390 ---
TraderForexFX, I added another 0 to all the parameters and the EA opened trades and appears to be working. I have it as USeTimeframe_M240 == true and Use-Close_of_bar_M240 == true as well. I assume that with both as true that it will only enter upon the close of the bar. I will let it run and let you know how it works on 5 digit brokers. Thanks btw.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I have posted on this thread before several times but been way for days. Is there a consensus that it is better to use the 4 t/f BB helper w/ alert? Should we use 2 dots for confirmation or 3, or does it depend on the t/f one is trading. If you are having success with this 4 t/f, what are the t/f's you are trading (actually, if one is using this, then they are really trading all t/f's, right? ) In one of the previous posts, much earlier, one had said that the BB helper does not update regularly. Does anyone disagree. Thanks Jacob

--- 帖子 #392 ---
With Close_of_bar_M240 == true, it will trade after the close of the first 4H green/red bar. However going into the next bar, it will trade only when the other conditions are met and not necessirily immediately on the open of the next 4H bar. TF

--- 帖子 #393 ---
The bars update regularly and has been observed to be correct. The numbers at the top left do not update regularly. Any one who can correct this is welcome to do so. TF

--- 帖子 #394 ---
thanks...are you using the one from post 379 by flyer415?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
TF, What numbers at top left are you referring to? Do you mean the BULL/BEAR text indicator that ludo posted?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I am talking of the BullBearHelper Indi. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=114 TF

--- 帖子 #397 ---
losingtrades and others... please note that the indicator was/is fokusnik. I merely added some arrow code, bar close and arrow selection quantity code to it with the intention that fokusnik would keep control of the various versions as he was the originator. Always hate it personally when there are numerous versions of indicators and I am never sure which one to use.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
here it is. It updates now. Note that i also moved the fixed max from 2.0 to 1.2 so you can see the actual numbers. Put it on M15 and you will see it update. Also note that you could put anything in that indicator name field including a calculation if you wanted one.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
sure, i did realize that you modified fokusnik's indicator...no problem... i was merely interested in which one to use since there are so many out there... for your post, are u having better success with having 2 or 3 t/f confirmations, or maybe 4? thanks

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I use #5. It does not have alerts built in yet. For settings I use 2 on H4, 3 on M15. Those are the only timeframes I trade. But i have taken trades on H4 with just 1 and it worked. Price action and other concepts was giving me additional info. hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
TradeForexFx, I have been using your EA for 2 days. I initially had 2 large losses and several small wins. That however was a problem with me setting up the EA and the closing of trades and not using the 0.01 settings. right now I have 5 open trades that are in total profit of $2100. That is even after one of the trades did a partial close so all 5 trades have $2550 in profit with $450 closed. Only put it on GJ, GU,Gchf,EU and EJ. No real reason for those pairs and I am overweighted in GBP which has moved. But nice EA.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
can you upload the set file u r using ? i tried it last 2 days and no trade yet. i put on GU. also whats the exact EA u r using

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I am using BullBearHelperEAv1. I use it on H4 only at this time. Note also that my set file is for a 5 digit broker and so i added an extra 0 to most of the parameters. If you are a 4 digit guy then delete the extra 0. The set file is attached. I had to zip it as set files cannot be attached.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Try this game: Demo only Open two new instances with $25K accounts. Use the following charts on both: AUDUSD,CHFJPY,EURJPY,EURUSD,GBPJPY,GBPUSD,USDCAD,USDCHF,USDJPY On one of the instance, use Out of the box settings for all pairs. On the other, just change the Use_Close_of_Bar_M240 to false for all pairs. At about 18:30 Eastern start the two instances. When the equity reaches plus 10% close all. Repeat next day. You might reach target within Asian Session or it might go on upto Newyork session. Irrespective, on achieving target close all and wait for next day. If you end up at a loss, close all by end of NY session or close to the beginning of next day. Using the same account, repeat at 18:30 Eastern. In the last four days, I have observed the target being met three days. The one day, net loss was not much. TF

--- 帖子 #406 ---
If you have or can find an indicator that shows the highest and lowest Account Equity during the day, you will not need to keep awake to know what happened while you were sleeping. If someone has such an indi, please post it here. Thanks TF

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Very Interesting. I am still having problem with EA. No trades. I trade with IBFX, 5 didgit broker. Is is possible flyer415/Tradeforex put here the corrected EA for 5 digit brokers. thanks

--- 帖子 #408 ---
thank you so much, i will try it now

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi, i've made some little modification to BullBearHelper indicator I'd like to know what do you think about it Thanks gspe

--- 帖子 #410 ---
ES Try it out on FXDD Malta demo and see if it works for you on FXDD. for IBFX, try using 1.1 as lot size instead of 1.01. Also change other quantities from 0.01 to 0.1. The results on IBFX for 4Hr time frame will be affected by the fact that the bar begins at different times for the two brokers. TF

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Nice presentation. Two things you might want to do: Use the same indicator posted by flyer415 here http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=398 Flyer fixed the indi so that correct bull bear values are shown. Add a parameter for timeframe, so that when the indi is placed on the lower timeframe, it will show the situation of the higher timeframe as per the parameter. (MTF) Also ES had requested an alarm for reversals, if that is possible... TF

--- 帖子 #412 ---
i will try it out. Thanks

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks, the indicator is just the same posted by flyer415, i've just cleaned a bit the code. The bull and bear values shown (at the indicator name right) are correct but not rounded to the unit, can be rounded if you think that will be more useful. gspe

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Maybe wait for a few more requests and update with those requests that might make the indi more useful. TF

--- 帖子 #415 ---
We have 90 posted attachments in this thread. Which post of your should we grab the EA from? thanks jacob

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Please use this EA as an "Helper" and not as a set and forget EA. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=312 TF

--- 帖子 #417 ---
thanks man. Is there such a thing as a set and forget EA? I have never heard of one.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
There is, infact there are many. Only if you like extra dark toasts. TF

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Just a simple suggestion, if I may, I hope EStrader can put the latest and most suggested indicators, EAs, and whatnots in the first post of this thread. Thank you, nice and very helpful posts.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
also if somebody can make a simple indicator that will list bull or bear against the timeframes chosen. if i chose H1, H4, D1 , it should list bull/bear for each of these in a tabular form , so that if all of them are bulls, i will go long and vice-versa we can also take more than one pair and show it in a table. when all are alligning, then if a pop-up comes up thats nice too !!!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hello ES Trader and others, I've started reading this thread. ES, thanks for sharing this system. It looks nice. If I am not wrong, current candle (at close) could give a sell signal. Question: the period you use for the bulls and bears indicator is 14, while default is 13. Why is that? If the system works, it doesn't really matter, but I asked myself.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Still no luck with EA as well for me... help, using FxCast, 5 digit

--- 帖子 #424 ---
That has already been written by fokusnik.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
There seems to be a lot of confusion over using the EA and not working on certain brokers...5 digit mainly. We know that TraderForexFx has it working on FXDD Malta (4 digit). We also know that I have it working on Alpari UK (5 digit) and that I included a set file that i used. Also on 5 digit all I did was add an extra 0 to the pip parameters. As i don't use the other brokers that people are saying they cannot get it working on I don't know the issue (could be symbol differences etc). TraderForexFX has suggested that you use one of the brokers that we know works in demo. Not sure that you should be trading this live yet without more forward testing. So download one of the brokers... load it up... use default set file on 4 digit...use my set file on 5 digit and see if it works. I was asked to migrate it to 5 digit broker support but i do not mod or create trading EAs. The thought that someone could lose money based on the fact that i missed a minor coding point would worry me too much. There are however coders who would be willing to do this. Ask TraderForexFx for his permission to post it in the Platform tech forum and ask for someone to do it.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Attached is a detailed statement from the last three days. The EA had a gross profit of $4284 and a gross loss of $4180 for a net profit of $103. Hmmm....seem bad...well let's see. Well $3020 or 72% of all losses are from GBPJPY. perhaps that pair is too volatile for a system such as this. In fact it only had one win on GBPJPY for $142. If I take out all GBPJPY trades then I get $4142 gross profit and a gross loss of $1156 for a net profit of $2986 or a profit factor of 3.58. Note that i let these trades run a while. i have to look at a profit taking scenario as well. Ignore the equity curve. For some reason Alpari thinks there is $17000 in the account but yet the balance only shows $5608

--- 帖子 #427 ---
thanks for the info...which time frame are you using the EA on? I can't get the EA to trade yet. Do I need to load any of the indicators, like the 4 tf or will it work just loading the EA file itself? Do I need to turn off all the other timeframes listed and just keep on the t/f I want to trade with? thanks jacob

--- 帖子 #428 ---
i see the problem I think...it is reading the spread at 27, not 2.7. Not sure how to fix...I check the inputs and can't find it. using fxcm uk...ecn...problem maybe with that?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
That is correct but that is why I have the parameter maximum_spread == 50. It is really 5 but the EA will work with it set at 50.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
will make the change...thanks

--- 帖子 #431 ---
3 seconds after changing he spread to 5, it opened a trade...the EA must have been chomping at the bit to open one. lost first trade...forget to add a zero to the SL and TP values...oops.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi everyone, On background, I've position traded and done some day trading in the equity market for years and have decided to learn forex trading. I've been doing a LOT of studying over the last few months as well as traded on a demo account. Out of every method and system I've traded, THIS one has been the easiest to learn and implement. (I think one needs a PhD in Mathematics to figure out some of the other systems I've seen! LOL). Thanks for the post. I appreciate seeing a system that I can understand.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
hi Fokusnik, thanks for the indi. i can see the arrows now. where should i place my SL, TP ? If i place this indi on H1 Chart, does it look into H1, H4, D1 for allignment ? alo would it be posible to give popup alert ?

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Good to know you like the system. It is simple as mentioned in the first post. I have been trading this system manually( Still trying to figure out EA) and doing fairly well. 4 hr chart with some breakout like Parabolic curve seem to work quite well. I am looking someway of moving the SL automatically following Parabolic Curve. May be someone here can help. Thanks

--- 帖子 #435 ---
. The EA in its present condition is NOT ready for unattended trading. The SL, TP, whether to release the traded lot in one go or use step wise trading and so many other things need to be worked on. These elements are not easy to establish and once "established" will never work for ever, rather they always remain an ongoing process. As such I believe that there can never be a "set and forget" EA. I have a couple of setups on 4Hr timeframe running unattended on 9 pairs (25K accounts). The one started on 18th of the month is sitting at $26K and one started on 22nd June is sitting at $27K. I shut down two setups based on 1Hr which were constantly running at a loss. Both the above 4hr setups had peaked above 28.5K Running such setups constantly unattended will not give us any conclusive decision. Flyer415 reported great profits when he used the EA on several pairs simultaneously on a 4Hr setup. I think that right after he reported this performance, there were moves that probably wiped out the gains. Am I correct flyer? I say this beause that is what happened to my setup which was sitting on a 10% gain. This is bound to happen. Moves often reverse completely and if you let a 4Hr setup close by itself, you are bound to give up most of your gains. I also observed huge profits using the 4Hr setup and that is when I suggested this "game". I ran the two suggested setups. Both the setups are presently in the negative. HOWEVER, one of the setup (Use_4Hr_close = false) at its peak was at $27,100 (plus 8%??). The other one (use_4hr_close = true) at its peak was at $25,750 (plus 3%). WHAT I PROPOSE: If you want to use this HELPER EA, I propose that Establish that the EA: is taking trades as per setup parameters is releasing trades as per setup parameters all the other parameters are working as desired Use the strategy tester and determine the best parameters for each of the pairs that you may want to trade. No need to go beyond six months for these tests. Using the best parameters from above, demo trade all the pairs as a basket. While deciding the lot size, use appropriate money management concepts, taking into consideration the possible maximum number of trades that may be happening at the same time. Demo trade the above plan (or any other plan that you wish to test) for as long as you need to before being confident about it, and only then PERHAPS consider going live. TF

--- 帖子 #436 ---
TF, I think that is a great plan. very methodical. I did allow my trades to continue to see if they would close out. Only the losses closed out. I think that I will also look at seeing if I can use Steve's EA for profit taking. Will have to put it on a separate chart and tell it to manage all trades as a basket for profit taking. It may create conflicts with your EA but can only try. I think the idea of a basket of trades is good but it could create large drawdowns. If we can use Steve's EA to manage once the trade is executed and not use your EAs management code then we could use a global drawdown number (say 2%) and a global profit number (say 4%) and have all trades close at those numbers. Again it may not work.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi ES You need to ensure that you are adding extra "0" to all the parameters that has anything to do with pips. Maximum_Gap Maximum_Spread MinPipsMargin (leave this to "0") ImitialHardstoploss InitialTakeProfit slippage First_Close_TP Second_Close_TP Third_Close_Tp StealthStopLoss MoveStopWhenProfit MoveStoptoProditOf StopWhenProfit SlippageforAbove MoveStopBy and anything else that I might have missed. Once again, also suggest that you try out on FXDD just to see if it works for you on FXDD. If it doesn't then there may be other issues. TF

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Possibly a useful indi for the purpose

Thanks TF. I will try it out on Fxdd . I have been busy trading this system Manually on 4 hr chart. Thanks for all your input.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi, roundrock! I'm not a professional programmer, I can't add a popup alert. If somebody can - go ahead, guys! If you place MTF indicator on H-1, it will take all the data from H-1, H-4, D-1 and W-1. When you are on H-1 and see that all four dots aligned, that means that H-1, H-4, D-1 and W-1 aligned and it's gonna be a very good entry. But even two dots alignment could be a pretty good entry. I trade GBPJPY, EURGPY and GBPUSD on H-1, I use TP 100 and SL 60. But TP and SL depend on the pair, the timeframe and your MM.

Anyone trading GU with this strategy this morning? Went long at 8AM on 1hr and 4hr reversal. Out a few pips right now. We'll see how it goes...

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Well out with half +28 pips, let the rest ride. Not bad. Couple of caveats. Bull Bear Helper repaints. In fact this move I got in on repainted, then repainted again back in my favor. Second, I turned down about 3 signals before I decided to take this one. Sometimes a pair will be stuck trying to break through S/R and it will give you a signal, etc... Definately will get you on the right side of a lot of trades, you just can't use it indiscriminatley. I don't know how it would do as an EA. Think I'll stick with it for a while and see how it develops. Thanks to the contributors of this thread.

Great thread, subscribed. Tried it last night during the asian session. Not a good result. Got stopped out -20. Nothings perfect in fx. I will keep researching. Thanks for all the efforts.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Just wanted to update on this position I took.. I got out on the other one at +20 pips, then reentered long on the 15 min signal with another two positions, which are both +82 right now. Overall I made +212 pips in one day with this trading the cable. We'll see what the weekend does to my open positions, but looks promising.

Good for you; I'm glad that you made money. How come when I look back on the charts, using this MTF indicator, at the very best this system looks like it wins 50% of the time? Has anyone done a historical analysis to ascertain what the win rate for this system is over a 1-2 year period? This would be very helpful to decide if this system is viable long term.

hello Es trader, A great system indeed! Bears bulls are the right way to go trading. I must also say that this system also has some losing trades. But if you are clever and logical about your stop loss and money management, one will silently grow his account. Cheers.

I've been working with the bull/bears system on various time frames just for fun. I've found, obviously, that it's much better for swing or position trading, but we already knew that. I've also added an EMA30 as a secondary indicator, which thus far has weeded out some false signals. I don't know much, being a novice, about many of the other indicators out there. I'm kind of a K.I.S.S. kinda guy! Have we gotten any closer to an EA for this system? I would like to see the MA added, as I think it decreases some of the minor risk involved even further. I'm going to play around with it and see what I can come up with. All in all, GREAT STUFF!

gspe, Please could you check the alert code, as it seems to alert only once then never again until it's reinitialized. I'm not proficient enough to see why this is from the code but if you could check I'd be very grateful. Thanks, ^ Chris ^

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi, try this version, should work now. You can use the parameter MTF_Hi_to_Lo to choose the preferred display order from Hi to Low or from Low to Hi Time Frame. Please let me know if it works correctly gspe

estrader looks like a good system. i will start trading on a demo. thanks for all your efforts, if i have any questions ill post them up here. im a noob to all of this hehe.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I was wondering what the diffrence is between your 4BARS_MTF_BBH and 4BARS_MTF_NLMA? When do you use which system and do they work well on particular currencies. Also do you have any current documentation on these systems. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Thanks gspe, I'll load it up and try it. ^ Chris ^

--- 帖子 #458 ---
in MT4 there are already standard bull and bear files.shoule we downloading yours here and replace them with standard ones or we just can use standard files already there? thank you

--- 帖子 #459 ---
gspe, Unfortunately it still only seems to alert once then goes to sleep... Thanks if you have time to have another look at the code. ^ Chris ^

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hi, try this and let me know if works gspe

Bears/Bulls, you might want to start thinking as Smart money/Dumb money, you need to understand a bit more on what the candle is telling you...long tails and such. Bulls/Bears will only give you an idea of who is in charge at that particular level. Check out the VSA thread...will work nicely with this. Brad.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Great, many thanks. Looks like that's it ^ Chris ^

--- 帖子 #463 ---
hi ES trader thank you for your great system and sharing with us. earlier here i have asked you a question regarding bulls and bears file in your #1 post in this thread. But i did not get any respond so far.as i asked earlier,should i replace the standard bulls and bears ex4 files already coming with MT4 with yours in post #1? if anybody else know the answer,please let me know. thank you

I as a new member to forex and specially to this thread kind of confused with all the indicators i have read and seen on these 31 pages of this thread. Can ES trader please attach the latest and updated all the indicators we need for this system in one post.So for the new members would be much easier to get all required indictors in one post. thank you fred

--- 帖子 #465 ---
i would appreciate that to as i am new aswell! regards

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi, no you don't need to change the file that come with MT4 gspe

--- 帖子 #467 ---
thank you alot fred

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I am also a newbie to this forum and am confused to which indicators I should be using and on what timeframes. Can anyone clarify the indicators to be used which version and which timeframe, this would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
ES it seams the thread has died are you trading this live still if so what have been your results i agree that an ea would be great for this . . .part of the reason i have not traded it is the 4hr tf. I'm not in one place that long

--- 帖子 #470 ---
iam new. how do i add the indicators to my igindex (u.k.) broker platform, and get the indicators to function / work properly ?

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Open your program folder, open your broker folder, open experts folder, copy the indis into indicators folder. Restart MT4.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
very interesting

I have started trading this system somewhat differently than before. Just take a look and offer some comments. Seem to work quite good on 1 hr chart but I am having problem trading the system without an EA. Trades seem to come often in Asian and european session . The New Rules are: Sell when Bear bar (RED BAR) turns positive( goes from - number to + number).But sell on a stop at the low of the bar( deduct spread) Buy when Bull Bar( Green bar) turns negative( from + number to - number) Buy on BUYSTOP at the high of the bar( plus spread)

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Use any MM to exit the trade. If the order does not get filled wait for the next signal.Some times may have to average down or up.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
ES Trader, it sounds very interesting. Could you please provide the template?

Hello, this is my first post on ff, and it is this bull/bear method, on which i ' worked a lot (thank you ES trader, for sharing). If my language seem you bizarre, it is because they are translated from French, my native language. I try to affinner the entry point of the trade in this way: a purchase, for example, requires that: the bull is above level 0.002, which means that the signal is passed quite strongly , but also as at the same time,. the bear at maximum to-0.002, or in positf, which means that the 'volume' of sale is weak.( see example below) Here, I compare a bit with the Delta (+ or_) employee on some platform, and it allows to filter a lot of false signals. I works in 1 or 5 minutes, found on the dax, ftse or, but it also works on the forex.For the management of the trade, I try to stop loss a 15 pip's, break even very fast, and I out fairly quickly if the trend will reverse. With this method, if you follow the trend a few hours, it as many signals, should be to l ' shelter of losses, and are often found beautiful trade in 15 or 30 pip's with a very tight stop. That all, ' wait your possible comments. Kind regards from belgium.

Hello ES Trader. Thanks for sharing this K.I.S.S system I've found your thread this couple of days and been following both your system .The Bear Bull and CCFp systems. Just tried out in demo account last night. I simply follow the SIMPLE RULEs that you gave. I am supprised both system do make alot of pips ( +- 300 pips). WOW..this is really cool.. But I just dont like the idea to add so many indicators for confirmation purpose. This can confuse us to make decission. We all know that the market can go against us any moment. Just use SL to protect our account. Buy the way, I use 4H at the moment. Will try using 1H later. I really like the K.I.S.S system. Keep it up... TQ
