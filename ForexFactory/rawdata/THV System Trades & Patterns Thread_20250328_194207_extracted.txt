Thanks Toranaga for starting this thread ... I have been learning this system for last one month with good improvement.I think in accordance with price action this system can be quite promising.I hope to learn from more experienced traders like you as well other traders who are actively using this system.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks so much for starting this thread. I've been contemplating starting one, but I'm not a very good disciplinarian so I figured that if I did, it would soon be as overrun with support requests from the newbs as the other one. Watching this today for BRC + THV signal Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Every entry (screenshot) will be allways preceded by a technical analyse (screenshot). Rules 1. Try to lock access to the newbie members. Rules 2 Don't post silly questions like (many gimme, guide me, explain to me, help me, direct me, is there, is this, where is, I can't, how do I, I need, I want, can you,...) . Rules 3

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Well, game on. Considerations: 1) Lower trendline of triangle has been retested and held, then retested and had a fake break, now retested, broken, retested from the opposite side and price is continuing in the direction of the break. (This is a common pattern. 2) R above has held and it is within my 15 pip stop where I want to enter 3) 10 pips room to nearest S. 4) I'm looking for a THV signal and I dont get my favorite (1 m retrace inside both 5 and 15 trix cross) so I go with a 6 point trade (1, 5, 15 all red and below 5m cloud), because signal is happening where I expected a trade to be, as posted above.

thanks misspips for posting charts and explaining PA with THV . I believe thats the best way to learn. It looks like flag pattern in your chart has broken now. I will wait for more conformation and than plan Asian session or tommorrows london session accordingly.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yeah it was a false break to the downside on the higher timeframes, but that's the good thing about scalping the 1m chart - if you get the entry right you can still make money on a false breakout on higher timeframes. Might be a good trade if the 5m chart comes back and retests near where the upper and lower triangle lines converge.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Ok, thanks for the nice response. I promise that i will post more, and not let Miss Pips do all the work. Its also a nice way for me to discipline me more and do one thing at a time. I often get lost in too many charts and things doing it all at the same time. I trade a little rudimentary, so i dont think my analysis will reach the MP level. But, everyone should contribute what he can, thats enough.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Here is a simply, possible M15 short in developing. The price is between FPV 1.2608 and CamarillaR2 1.2603 at the moment. Trix crossed, (ignoring Coral and Ichi cloud) M30 and H1 look like they are going in the same direction. Also CCI is on the way to cross, but have him on my laptop so he isnt on the screen cap in this pic. I would say, wait for another Candle or try a quick M5 scalp.. But, its more a watch and learn setup. The 1.2600 psych level does not invite for a trade.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
The same situation as M5 view. As we can see, The price, the camarilla and the Coral are about to touch each other. As we know till now, in 98% of this constellation some action follows.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Now we know more. Bounced exactly at caR2 That was a lesson in wait.. and wait.. and dont loose. In my mind, a good trader is not one who makes a lot of win trades, its one who have less or very less losses.. If you have only one win, and no loss, youre fine for the day.. M15

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Also, if your risk reward was 2 to 1 you would be up for the day

--- 帖子 #15 ---
As i wrote that, we was here: yellow circle. Now orange. M5. The 1.2600 disturbs me a little but since the first post, no change in Price ?? Still 1.2607 +- 5 pips range ? And, from M5 till D1, for me, it looks like a short. Of course i can be completely wrong, he he. Watching M5 and writing here, i decided to make a overnight D1 short he he. D1 SL 1.2720. All systems and chart patterns fail, if a 1.2605 wants to be a 1.2695 and not a 1.2520 For me, the simply but great Coral made the decision.. Also looking in higher TFs for D1.. And pivs. And trix. And PA. And no News at the moment.. To disturb and change the pattern..

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I took the same trade. Glad to see I'm thinking like the best.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Lets see the screen cap ?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Nice to see you posting again. I was afraid all the posters of the 'your chart sucks' variety had managed to run you off for good. I'm sure you can feel free to post them over here. Not to sound too sexist but the other thread hasn't had anybody with a firm hand to keep things in order since Cobra left; however Torenaga sounds like he means business, so I don't think anybody will get out of line over here.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks MissPips And for the sake of completeness, the M5 Chart today.. Have to admit, did not had such a strike for a while, but that was a perfect trade. I was right with all my deliberations and cashed 65 pips, what started as a scalp. Could do more but chickened out today. Afterwards.. mhh I hope you folks dont think im boasting, im surprised by my self about my accuracy, he he.. We have great sometimes simple system, its on us to use it well.. The two orange lines at the left side mark the yellow and orange circles from the post before.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi and welcome. Friends of MP are my friends also

--- 帖子 #21 ---
And at least the H1 Chart. The two orange lines still remain from M5 The right one was the orange circle in M5 day before. Notice how the PA touches the Coral, Trix cross happens (ugly but there) and then a 100 pip move follows. Starting to like the Coral more than the Trix ?!? Simply but powerful. Sometimes a use her as SL (+ - few pips) or like the last trade, for the final direction decision.. But, to mention that, i dont follow the Short below, Long across rule. I miss too much trades this way..

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...00#post5813800 great post..

--- 帖子 #23 ---
No one could run me off that easy. I was just on vacation for the previous week, and the Mrs didn't want me trading on vacation. Here's my trade from last night. My favorite setup right now is what I call a wide bar liquidity gap. If you look at my first chart, there was a very wide bar on 15 min chart, which leaves a risk gap for market makers. The blue rectangle demonstrates where price needs to return to minimize their risk. Once it touches or gets with a couple of pips, I start looking for rainbow/8 light trades. The second chart show this nicely with harmony of 1/5/15 min trixes, and a recent break in support. Now this trade was probably a little more risky as the EURUSD had already fallen a decent amount. However, since I didn't trade last week, I was itching for action, so I took it, and was fortunate enough to be successful.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Watching this, though with all the news it might be hard for me to get a trade in since my rules don't allow me to trade near news. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Well, a break, retest and continuation of that flag worked out pretty well, and THV gave good entry signals. Unfortunately for me my rules don't let me trade so close to news so I stayed out. What do you all do? Do you trade when you get a good signal close to news or sit it out? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #26 ---
offcourse i dont trade near the news...i learned a lession hardway blowing my first account mainly because of my urge to catch fast and more pips on news time. now a days i dont really dare to go directly in storm...haha

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi, would you be so kind to sahre the Trix MTF you have at the bottom of your charts, I have not been able to find them elsewhere. Regards

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Did you read the first post ? No ? Why not ? NO REQUESTS or coulda woulda shoulda here !!! Next will be banned. Post your other questions in the THV - System thread ! Period! And dont answer me. I dont want to know it.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
To be honest i dont care about News. Sometimes really rare, i sit on my hands during Red News, but usually i notice them and that was it. There is a 50:50 Chance that the News trade will go in my direction, so why to miss the Signal. Maybe not the best strategy but works till now for me. Have to mention it, i also have a separate Dukascopy account with few 100 € there only for News trading. I use it few times per month only for big red news trading. Then sitting there and waiting for the start, like in the IPO trading days, decade ago.. And your heart is at 200 bpm.. Till now the account is still alive.. Its fun..

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Yeah, but there's a difference between just jumping in to chase pips and taking a proper signal, even if it's near news. The reason I don't do it is because that's a rule I carried over from the system taught at the Babypips site (which wasn't very good to begin with). I have noticed (even though I sit them out) that usually the entry points given by a proper signal are usually good even if they are near news. I've also been doing manual backtesting a variation of the 6 lights method for the 5 m chart (I only count points from closed bars to prevent the 'repaint issue') and I also demo trade to conduct forward testing. The win percentage is pretty good even though in the case of the backtesting I have no idea when the news was, and in the case of the demo forward testing I just ignore it. So I was wondering what other people do about trading (only proper THV signals of course) near the news.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks, forgot to say that. Thats true. Thats the reason why i ignore news

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thanks. I've really been tempted lately to get rid of that rule, because I'm beginning to suspect that the money you miss out of by not taking those trades more than covers the occasional time when the news goes against you. I didn't get any trades at all today because all the setups happened at times my rules didn't allow and they were all good. It does seem to me just from what I've observed that more often than not the market has anticipated the news, so that when you see a classic trigger during news (like the triangle BRC today) it works most times because that's what the market was setting itself up to do anyway.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I think it really depends on the news that is coming out. With all the crap going on in Europe, CPI or other similar items hardly seems relevant right now. Now CPI, retail sales, ISM, etc may be relevant for Aussie or Kiwi, but it seems like most news is irrelevant right now with the Euro. The ones I stay away from are rate decisions, employment numbers, and any time Bernanke is scheduled to speak. The other news is on my radar, but it seems like the smart money anticipates what the news is going to be before it's released. I think this is why so many of the THV trades are successful just before news events.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I've already posted my template several times in the THV thread. Miss Pips has posted hers numerous times as well. My template just has a few modifications that suit me a little better. Please do some research and reading before asking those types of questions here.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
misspips i have been using 5 min chart ..6 light method ....15 f , 15 s, 30 f and 60 f. And cloud 15 and 30. and on demo i am also taking trades during news time with good result. only problem i am having right now is with coral....usually if i am confident about my price action analysis than i will ignore coral and will place my trade. because sometimes it gets too late if i wait for price to cross coral.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Nothing special, only clicking the Chart from M1 to D1 with Pivots and Trix. To become a impression.. Usually i do it slower. And longer Sadly they are too dark (on my screen as a screen cap, at you ?) But thats the way i start trading usually. Nice day today. That i missed because i was working ?!? Really, authentically, hard work. Nice to know its over in few weeks After the big drop, M5 and M15 looking at most promising imo. Still sideways and waiting, bias short.. Previously i laugh when i read that scalper have a look at D1 for M1 scalping, but now i know better. First thing i do when mt4 starts.. Inserted Video

I don't get sound on that video - don't know if it's just me.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
No Sound there.. Its only to get a impression, not being disturbed by sound or news or predictions like on the €/$ Thread..

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I really really love this M5 pattern after a big drop.. The KEy is patience, but im also The Master of not patience. But im learning..

--- 帖子 #41 ---
5 M5 candles later.. Also, its 00 midnight here. New start for Pivots and Sidney and Japan and all here.. Pivot and Coral met at M5. Wait and see.. Also with 1.2392 near to the .2400 psych level. Now the next thing to do, have a look at M15. H1? Im still a scalper.. But with less time at the moment..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
It seems we started.. Break of Coral, Trix is like short, plus next Pivot is miles away, and at this time the moves are obvious. Usually.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
With this bad ATR still a nice trade, even at M5.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Also see.. H1, what a cool pattern.. Not to say epic..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks all for your comments about taking setups near news.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Maybe last chance this week to collect few more pips,of course,if PA retrace.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Ok, i know, have to discipline myself and not flood too much The last spontaneous post.. Now we know more. Expected happened. The easiest way to manage this patern was to make a Pending Buy and a Pending Sell Order. Maybe somewhere at the yellow lines. It would be nice if someone could post the same Chart, €/$ Friday, H1 with his setup..

--- 帖子 #48 ---
4exNinja posted some nice entries on the hourly charts in the other thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...24#post5820924

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Watched this and waited for a short made a screen cap for here, but then got a phone call and missed it completely. For me it was a clear short, despite M15 H30 showed a long. Second pic, after the phone call..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Why a short ?, only because touching the Coral in my mind. And a little bit pivots, and the momentum.. Had the feeling Trix gave no Signal but after the turquoise circle Candle it was clear it will be a nice short. Second pic the same in M1.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I buy when it showed signal, but not concentrate afterward divergence bearish. 15pip profit but still want more lead me to lost. anyone can tell me beside divergence bearish, have any another reason for bear so strong

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Oh,yes,you opened this order a few pips below of the top of Asia session,dont even think to do this in the future.Buy only after break and retest of upper level and vice versa.Look at the trixes,fast is below slowtrix which is not long signal.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks Ricmi! and I see my mistake is chasing the trade too. I sell when it break the trendline and lucky me, it take back all money I have lost.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I buy at 1.22765 SL:1.22465 TP: 1.23215 all rules of THV is confirmed.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Out of trade: -19pip taking sell: 1.22553 SL: 1.22766 TP: 1.21928

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Gap at blue rectangle, filled, confirmation down with everything except 5min slow trix. I know this pic shows the 5min slow is red, but when I placed the trade, it was still green.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Your chart like a garden I sell EU too, but not sure enough because we are in Support zone, becareful

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I know that THV commudity is very crowded out there. Why everyone just read and out, nod recomment on this thread. Sharing is caring. Donn't keep silence, We are here to connect with other. Hope to make friend with everyone. Wish the THV commudity get more and more profit everyday. Still keep Sell EU from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Not sure what you mean by my chart being a garden, but I like gardens so I'll take it as a compliment I was a little hesitant about the trade, because of the support, but the gap trades have just been so accurate, I have a hard time passing them. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to get the +10.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Same exact trade as last night. Same result: +10

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Because your chart is very colorful, like a line of flowers . I donn't use SAH because my computer is very hot if I use it Just Sell EU, but it seem too soon and not good at all. Tight SL 15pip, can be hit.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Nice wide range bar forming on EU 15min. If it can close near its high, it will create a nice gap. If the gap gets filled I'll be looking to get long on THV confirmation as I've shown. Update: 15 min bar closed with a very long wick, and there's a good amount of divergence on the 5 min. I'm sitting this one out until we at least get the 5 min fast to go below the slow, and then start to turn green.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Not good at all, hit my SL: - 12pip. not follow the rule of THV lead me to the hell

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Keep watching price, S&amp;R, S&amp;D levels. This has helped me spot areas that interest me. THEN, if I get a good looking entry from THV, I'll jump on it. Keep at it.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
New weeks starts. Good luck for all What about Usd/Cad D1 ?! If it breaks the WS1 1.0124 Pivot it could be a nice short..

--- 帖子 #66 ---
H4 What has that to do with the original THV rules. nothing much, but i try to develop some. And a nice pattern. Lets see what happens.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Manually closed at + 45 pips /too early/.The reason for entry was pretty clear situation: bounce of 88%fibs,bullish divergence and 60m inside bar.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I made two trades on the EURUSD. One just before Frankie open, and the other was about an hour later. The first trade had great MA compression, a failed rainbow flip, a double top, and great BeOB on the 15min chart. The second trade was another one of my faves, with a gap fill at the blue rectangle, and then THV confirmation. I've found that these trades are safest if you have both 1, and 15 min trixes in harmony, and the 5 min fast in harmony. If you wait for 5min slow to be in harmony, you often get in too late on these types of moves.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thank you guys (and girl) for the posts. I really love this ( my first ) thread.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Advanced Thv..

--- 帖子 #71 ---
And, the M5 at the moment pattern, where Trix sometimes (rare) fails. But, then to be sure you have to have a look at higher or lower TFs. It makes a different picture. For me, the success in Forex is easy, if You have the Hunters Patience. Nothing more. Maybe knowledge. Or you do it intuitive, nature allays honor this. Working on it.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
USD/CAD H4

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Looking good at D1.. If it breaks WS1.. now.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Had Usd Cad M1 on my left screen. While surfing or researching in the Internet, learning PA and watching it from time to time. Zoom. Nice pattern, you can see often. Hit the Coral exactly. Amazing. Beauty of a chart. attempt 1 2 3 4 ok, big drop..

--- 帖子 #75 ---
And afterwards..

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Afterwards 2 Also, the last white circle was live to watch it thrilling, Break or no break of the Coral.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
And guess what

--- 帖子 #78 ---
happened..

--- 帖子 #79 ---
The last post should be my last for today but thats a gift and a must. Happened as i wrote. Mh, starting to recognize Usd/CAd respects the Pivots more than Eur/Usd like it seems..

--- 帖子 #80 ---
till i wrote..

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Goal one achieved..

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Break of Coral.. Again, live to watch it is much cooler..

--- 帖子 #83 ---
..

--- 帖子 #84 ---
..

--- 帖子 #85 ---
..,

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Enough for today. Hope it was Educational and not boring. Thats one of the ways how i trade.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Trix cross at Zero plus wait for Coral Break plus next candle.. Exit at Fast Trix Color change or if pa cant manage it to go over q3S1,

--- 帖子 #88 ---
the white circle is my entry, get +25pip at this time.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Just Buy EU at 1.22936 SL: 1.22709, TP: 1.23478

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here we go. Usd/Cad, D1 Better than on Monday. Sad its Friday tomorrow. Monday would be great for this pattern..

--- 帖子 #91 ---
In my mind, only because it is Friday tomorrow, and its such a clear short Signal (again) but against Pivots and the momentum it is also very possible that is a fake signal. (Rare Trix fail..) Trix Cross with a nice arc , but wait for the next close candle

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Exactly that happened.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Exited the Monday trade at Thursday afternoon and decided to wait what happens. Exit: I was aware about the perfect short lasting singe Monday the MS1 and WS2 Pivots were quite near, so i closed it with Profit, better than wait for more profit ans loose all.. And also, it was a nice bottom of the Channel.. Possible entry: Trix Cross (short) at Thursday night, (cyan) wait for next Candle and the close of it. means in D1 the next Day. Friday. Seeing the Fridays Close HA, it was clear that the Signal will fail. Yellow. HA Candle Description. One candle with a small body surrounded by upper and lower shadows indicates a trend change: risk-loving traders might buy or sell here, while others will wait for confirmation before going short or long. And now complete different picture. One day (and a weekend between) later. it looks like its a Long from here. Seeing the HA Candle plus Trix Cross Long in the developing. For a real, no risk entry i should wait till Tuesday. Monday close.The Orange circles are the break points if the trend continues..

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Also, have a look at W1 and MN Yes, i usually scalp.. M1.. But starting to like daily more and more.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I donn't see any chance for Buy in this situation

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Im talking about Usd/Cad.. Do you see it now But at this point its risky to get in, 'you' missed the first move, wait for the next opportunity.. Break of Coral. Or not. If you switch from M1 to D1 on daily basis, is a hell of a conversion..

--- 帖子 #97 ---
To boast.. I coulda woula shoulda made the TP bigger. But was (too) cautious. At the other side, if you (me) can make 26 ! or 10-15 pips every second day or 2-3 times per week, on D1 without being greedy, its he ticket to serenity.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I learned this lesson hard, but now i know more. Its never to early. Never. What you have is that what you have. 25 pips on Daily or 1.7 pips on M1 its enough, If you rate is about 80 %. And proper SL. Every time i tried to do more i lost ALL at the End of the week. Or diminish my gain. 45 pips one day is a great achievement. That once per Week, Eternity. Patience it the key as i mentioned before (and a lot of $$ in the account + leverage) and im the master of NO patience, as i mentioned before.. but im learning. D1 relaxes in some way..

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Sorry! I only trade EURUSD I buy EUR, it go 25pip profit but Im too greedy so it turn to lose - 20pip

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Why don't you try to use trailing stops and secure some of your profits ?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Try CCI and/or DPO for better exit.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks mihaifrcsn and heispark, I will try your opinion. Just sell EU SL: 20pip, TP: 30pip

--- 帖子 #103 ---
FOCUS: Intraday trade Entry: 12-07-24 09:43 (-8 GMT) Buy Price = 1.01663 - once in positive territory, around the FPV, 115 point Trail Stop set. Reasoning: Touch of the S1 Pivot line and another effort a couple of candles later. (Downward momentum is slowing, S1 usually strong) BV Indi had a climax low a few candles before as well as a High Churn Green previous candle. (looking like the sellers were getting exhausted) Very long shadow, bear side, a few candles before. (Usually tells me that sellers getting exhaused) 30 and 15 MN TF also show a QQE Cross to the Upside at the bottom of the QQE channel. (Usually, indicates reversal) Over 150 pips from the 50 EMA. (Normally, will begin to go back to this EMA level when @ this far away) NOTE, Personal Thoughts: ONLY expecting @ FPV, 1.01789 where I took some profits and let the rest ride the Trail Stop. RED Vert Line and Red UP arrow was my entry point on the pic. Currently, @ 200 pips in the Green at the Trail Stop. Price / buyers seem to respect R1 level, so, that's were I'm now expecting it to stop out around there. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm still trying to try out the different Templates with V3 and V4. I'm integrating a better entry and exit strat with what's been working for me. So, here you go. Best trades are the ones that follow YOUR rules. Even if you lose pips, as long as you followed YOUR rules, you'll make pips in the end. Fear is the mind killer...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Here it is with IBFX. PV are not the same as the PV of the Oanda pics from last post. Entry, was about the Arrow up, above the MS1. I was shooting for FPV, shown @ 1.01745 and finish up @ R1, 1.01979. Trix was green crossed as well. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

47 PIPS profit. A nice way to open the London Market.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
47 pips is impresive, but I can not see THV rules are met except for a 1m trix cross, below cloud and coral and 5m, 15m and 1H trix are pointing in the opposiote direction. Am I missing something? However I see a entry at 8.12am, will not give you 45 pips.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
The entry was at 09:56 my time (GMT+3), and the Lodon open was at 10:00. Buy at 1.2059, exit at 1.2106 (10:01 GMT+3). I started to "ignore" MTF Lights if i see a setup, and i am thinking to remove them from my indicator list. I missed a lot of trades because of them.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
The sudden volume increace is amazing. M5

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I was talking about Long. Short, different story.. I was right again and 'own' 27 pips at the moment. Nice moment to exit the trade, but learning by doing.. (and a little bit greedy) Every time i say, ok close the trade and lets see how it develops afterwards and learn, i forget to follow find something new and miss the experience.. Nice bounce at Coral + Small Body long shadows HA Candle. Both of course probably .. Will stay in, can afford it to loose that in the moment, and the learning effect would be great.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Great suggestion. Also nice for entry's, with Trix and Coral together, 3 from 3, unbeatable.. DPO what ? where to search about it ?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Low volume, but looking for s3 as a possible downturn from the MS3 and Trix Bear indi on the M15. Also, the H4 trend looks bearish along with the H1 Large Bear candle causing hesitancy for the Bull. H4 Trix cross is bearish, H1 Trix is Bullish, and it's not clear where it will go... Tryin out a short here with a target above the S3 and a trailing stop of 40 pips. If it goes down below 20 pips, moving my stop to BE +2. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I believe what Heispark was alluding to was: Detrended Price Oscillator http://forex-indicators.net/dpo-detr...ice-oscillator To forecast a trend that is loosing steam... Looks like it could help. I'd have to read up a bit more on it myself.

question for toranaga, can you share your indicator vsa please? i guess you wil lnot explain all your research and way to trade, but can you give us a clue for the research, do you use it combinately wit the Trix crossed or the cloud or both? i like the ax indicator linke to the basic THV, it gives us the return narrow sometimes, and a bit like the MACD, you can see a next trend chance to get 20 or 30 pips sometimes, conciliated to the basics trix cloud and coral M5 is my favorite as many traders thv, i guess

--- 帖子 #124 ---
please share your experience with wich brooker it seems the best browse of the reality of all the volumes. of course, one brooker is not the reflect of all the trades. but some have high volumes like oanda , alpari.. maybe its better for such indicators... also, another question, but linked. what brooker do you advise (you have 1 spread) do you use the THV as EXTERNAL chart or you let your brooker see the THV?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
? Please stay on topic. Did you read the first post ?

nice words, with some chart caps trend lines and circles, it would be a great post

btw. Aud/Nzd circles and trend lines.. Again.. H4 HA pattern. At the moment. Still short in mind for Monday at Aud/Nzd in D1 but the H4 .. Again, sad its Friday. What a cool Monday opening it could be.. will be..

--- 帖子 #128 ---
H4 Forgot to say, plus candle close at WPV 1.2940 D1 What a great HA candle. Lets see what happens..

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I think i phone to much.. again Made this screen cap, named it Wait1 and was sure a big move would happen, 60:40 short imo CORAL SLIDE Trix behave suspicious.. Thats why i named it wait. Wait what will hapen and catch it at the right time. 75:25 short chance i would jump in immateriality, he he

--- 帖子 #130 ---
10 second later after i made the screen cap of course a phone call.. Friend of mine, trucker, hi blah, driving on the road, needs for Thursday a black box that can split 1 decoder Signal in 2 so he can reproduce the Signal to the Bar in his basement that he owns also for the Mother of all games Greek teams Football game.. ?!

And here we go. Break. Trix Cross in far developing, but too much pivots awaiting, would not count on that. + enough is enough, im thankful for the achieved. so i stop now, and think about what a cool girlfriend a have.. he he and have to admit, no clue for the next trade.

And chickened out to to early..

--- 帖子 #149 ---
At the moment. Finally broke 1.2400 Trix Cross exact on Zero with break of Coral in the same time. Atr now 10 !! What a pattern.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
So cool. Still at the moment.. First HA with small body + Trix. Also Pivots. Also big run that is loosing steam.. What will happen now, hmm

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Expected a bigger drop. Trix went to fast with too less pips down. Out. Dont want to wait 5-15 min till i can close the trade again.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Reminder for me. Yes Trix went fast down but still had room to Trix Oversold (?!? meh)

--- 帖子 #153 ---
For the people with patience.. Nice M5 pattern in the developing..

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Of course afterwards, i should be more patient. there is oversold and there is Extreme Oversold. plus, trust the simply natural reason. Something that goes fast up, will come 1/2 fast down first. Sometimes it takes few M1 candles..

--- 帖子 #155 ---
That a great pattern. From left to right. Red small body Ha, trix cross. Coral cross to be more sure. Exit, fast Trix Color change, small body Heikin Ashi..

EURAUD: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/Slide1.jpg Easy 85 pips today taking a low risk trade where almost everything lined up perfectly Reason for the trade (if the font is too small in the pic): Price broke through the Coral and is above the moving average (light blue line). Notice how I waited to enter until price broke not only through the moving average but also the Coral (which often serves as a major source of resistance). Patience is key!!! Both Trix were green and pointing upwards. Stochiastics were already in overbought territory, but as long as it’s not red and pointing downwards that’s fine. Also note how price tried to reach lower lows twice, but both times bounced off the Fractal support line (light blue). That's normally a clear sign of a (temporary) trend reversal. Trading of the 1hr charts btw and my stop loss is normally automatic (5 EMA shift 3 as stop loss), but this time I exited manually because I'm happy with a 85pip gain (especially considering Trix seems to indicate some sort of reversal). Don’t ask me why price moved that way, I haven’t read any financial news today…this is pure chart analysis how it should be. I exited the trade manually Finally back from travelling, time to catch up on trading... @Toranaga: Look into the EMA 1.4 automatic stop loss EA...the 5 EMA shift 3 seems to offer pretty good stop loss points

--- 帖子 #159 ---
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/EURAUD.png EURAUD is currently one of my favorite trading pairs because it trends nicely and shows very few fake signals. The trade resulted in a 50pip gain, so happy times Reasons for trade: Price was above the Coral (so I should favor long trades!), but it also bounced off an important daily Fractal resistance line which I expected to hold. The majority of the candle body was below the moving average. Both Trix were red and pointing downwards. In addition, the cross happened at the 0.00000 point, which generally results in stronger moves. Stochiastics were red and pointing downwards. They also came down all the way from the extremely overbought area…a good sign! My initial stop loss was at the moving average, so approximately 14 pips from my entry point. I exited the trade manually because I had to buzz off to a work meeting

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi. Thank you for your great posts. Read them several times. Nice analysis..

--- 帖子 #161 ---
..

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Here are my entry rules if you care (my exits are easy, just exit whenever price hits the 5EMA shift 3)... For going long (short is the inverse): 1) The candle body is at least 5pips, with the majority being above the 5EMA. 2) If price is above the Coral, the fast Trix has to turn green (which is basically a TDI cross upwards). The slow Trix doesn't necessarily have to be green, but if it isn't, the failure rate is a bit higher...still profitable to do it though 3) If price is below the Coral, the fast and slow Trix have to be green and the fast one needs to cross the slow one upwards. 4) Stochiastics needs to be green and pointing upwards. They can remain in overbought area for quite a bit, so I tend to pay least attention to Stochiastics. Basically, Stochiastics can't go against you...so when going long they can't be red and pointing downwards. 5) Fractal support/resistance are used to stay out of "trouble zones". If price is still just below a level when going long I might wait until the candle body (not just the wick) crosses that level before entering a trade. My stop loss is always the 5EMA (shift 3), so for most trades I won't enter until price has moved 8+ pips through the EMA in the direction of my trade. Essentially you're going to end up with a number of smaller losses (5-10pips) and then capture the breakouts that totally make up for it. If you're awake during the London/NY session you almost always end up with a few very nice 100pip+ moves. I trade 7 pairs, but this works for all pairs (haven't tested all of them, but spot checked even some weird ones). I only use the H1 charts because I don't like lower time frames. The reason is that all data is 15min delayed, and the big institutions can really mess with the lower timeframes for a short period...but they can't really do that on longer time frames. H1 seems to work fine, as does H4. If you trade H4 you will get less fake moves, but at the expense of capturing full moves.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi 4exNinja, thanks for posting your entry/exit rules here! This sort of thing is somewhere along the lines of what I've been trying to develop for myself... I'll try it out and see how things go! Do you use that custom EA for exiting trades? (@Toranaga: Look into the EMA 1.4 automatic stop loss EA...the 5 EMA shift 3 seems to offer pretty good stop loss points) I did a bit of searching on google for it and couldn't find any links - do you know where I could get it? In other news, there could be a possibility of a long trade on the USD/JPY with 4exNinja's strategy later today if trix agrees...

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Possible short setup on the AUDUSD, PA seems to be sitting nicely below 1.05 round level, waiting on a coral cross though. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I know this trade is against the rainbow, but it was just too perfect. H&amp;S reversal, gap is filled by Right Shoulder, trix harmony. Only issue is 5 min divergence.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi, bro. I am also a big fan of one hour chart! :-)

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Follow up on the earlier AUD/USD trade: I could have actually entered earlier with 4exNinja's rules, however still managed to bag 60 pips! The PA technically hasn't touched the 5EMA, but with the fast trix turning I didn't want to take any chances, so I manually closed it. Of course as I'm writing this the price is still falling Anyway, I'm quite keen for the potential this system has! I have another open position short on the EUR/USD by the same rules that is nearly at a 40 pip profit already... impressive I must say! Kudos to 4exNinja and the THV team

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Yeah, I sometimes exit manually too and then regret it. The 5EMA works really well, so there's no reason not to trust it...I tested it over a TON of trades. Having said that, exiting manually if you are happy with the amount isn't a bad thing if locking in profits can have a positive effect on your mental state. Either way, the system works and it's the only system I use. Keep in mind we're in a holiday season, so the number of "fake" signals is a bit higher than normally.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
New week started. Amazing hov it got stuck to Camarilla S1.. M5 Chart..

--- 帖子 #170 ---
And here we go. That was what i waited for. M5 M1

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Of course not the right time for a trade, too big spread and too less Atr, but pivots working. As usual..

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Ok. I would say, back were we started. But wait for the next M5 Candle..

--- 帖子 #173 ---
And if M1 breaks the 1.2350 mR1 M1

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Forex is so so cool. Sometimes. Yep. Done it. M1 M5

--- 帖子 #175 ---
And afterwards, have a look where it stopped. M1

--- 帖子 #176 ---
M5

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Addition. M5 Tp Exit points..

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I think thats a new fast move pattern in the developing.. Even on M5. Lets see.. 5-15 pips i think.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
View at M5 resulted to 2 great short possibilities in M1.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
plus, more fast short PA, if you could await the M1 Fib. Piv break..

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Afterwards..

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Did not break the MA5. M5

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Loving your insight Toranaga! Wish I had been around to watch the market's behaviour earlier! All the best to everyone for the new trading week!

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Potential short trade on the AUD/JPY in the next hour or two... Coral is providing resistance and 1H stochastics has just turned down. I'll be waiting until the start of the new hour to decide whether I'll commit. EDIT: Or perhaps even a long trade on the break of the coral...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
AUDUSD short trade seems to line up on the H1 chart...still too early to jump in though. Tbh, I don't enjoy trading at the moment because the holiday season results in a few too many fakeouts.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hmm... I'm already in short on the AUD/USD. Just curious, what do you think it is that makes it too early to trade? I can see a bounce off the coral, trix cross in the last hour with both fast and slow showing red, and stochastics in the correct direction. There is some RBA news coming out tomorrow however... EDIT: My AUD/USD trade was just stopped out by the EA, so I guess you were right ninja. TEACH ME!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
3 hours ago.. I dont know exactly what you saw, but if that was the picture, for me it was a clear Short Signal. Entry, after the small body HA Candle Close, (of course a view on lower TFs first) to be more sure, wait for breaking 1.0450 H3 Camarilla. fast Trix Color change, also +, bounce on Coral Exit, 1.0334 Camarilla Pivot.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Worth to wait and watch it.. M15

--- 帖子 #189 ---
At the same time M5 is heading to FPV and Open.. Short soon.. (?)

--- 帖子 #190 ---
And, what a pretty M1 Pattern..

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Still no short opportunity in M5, but i think soon.. Patience..

--- 帖子 #192 ---
If it breaks R1 Camarilla i will stop it, and change the Pair..

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I think now it stops. Lets see what it will do at the open.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
he he, amazing. Screen cap 6 hours ago, short time after the last post above.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
6 hours later still lurking at open.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I don't have much experience trading THV on anything larger than a 1H timeframe, but I can see a possible set-up on the EUR/JPY for a long trade (daily time-frame). Does anyone have any advice/thoughts on this? I haven't really traded this pair before, but I can see from the daily chart that it seems to trend strongly, at least recently. It seems almost positioned for a down move on the 1H chart, although still quite close to the coral.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I ended up acting on my earlier sentiments for the EUR, except on the EUR/AUD. I think the yen pair would've been a bit more profitable by this point, but I'm still pleased with how it's going so far - up about 60 pips at the moment. It just broke some key fractal resistance as well, so I'm going to try and hold this trade for a while and see where it takes me.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I dont know if you are talking about hours or days, but have some care here. Daily chart at the moment..

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hmm... I had been thinking of trying to hold for a few days - my stop is set at breakeven, so I'm not too worried. I should have opened multiple positions and closed one, allowing the other to continue. I might consider closing it soon... 70 pips in the bag at the moment

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Nothing special, but WW. (wait and watch..) If it breaks MA5, maybee.. Also gives some nice M1 scalp opportunities..

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Arrrggghhhh, perfect trades today...and I missed them all because of work meetings Shorting the USD and going long EUR and AUD on the 1hr charts was perfect...everything lined up. I and two of my work clients (I work in real estate investment) are in the process of creating an EA for my strategy...we already hired an Indian programmer (cheap!), but sadly it's going to be a while until he's done accounting for all parameters. At least once he's done I won't miss those nice trades anymore PS: Just fyi, the 5EMA (shift 3) works great on higher timeframes too. The downside is that trades get triggered later and you also get kicked out a bit later...so often you won't catch the full move like on the 1hr charts. Below 1hr you get kicked out too easily imo.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Dont know. I ignored the MA for a long time (why?) and now starting to gain experience. Imo its a great addition here. Till now i use it as a pre entry Signal before the entry Signal.. Only as a before confirmation or hint what could happen.. Still stick to the Thv rules.. At most. Have shift 2. Or is 3 realy better ?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I ended up closing the trade at a 71 pip profit (right at the top of the wave), good call Toranaga, thanks for the advice! There's a lot of interesting potential in the charts at the moment... I particularly like the GBP/USD - sitting at some serious resistance from previous highs. 4exNinja, I'm glad to hear the EMA works well for higher TF's I did some backtesting before I had to race off to work this afternoon, and it does indeed seem quite good - I'd love to look for more long opportunities this week on the EUR with that in mind. And mate, if you get an EA happening, I would be SO keen to get on board! The feeling of missing a good trade because of something in real life can be incredibly frustrating!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I use that MA for both entries and exits. For entries the HA candle body (NOT the wick!!) has to pass through the MA with the majority of the body being above/below the candle depending on whether you go long or short. I tested shift 2 and shift 3, and while shift 2 sometimes allows you to enter earlier and drop out earlier upon reversals...it also means you are facing an increased amount of "fake" moves and dropouts when price would continue in your direction after a short while. Shift 3 seems to be the best setting I found.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Before MA, i would jump in the trade maybe here and there (or if would be more difficult, switching TFs or do other stuff) to exactly time the entry, now, as you can see, fast trix color change - nope trix cross - nope

--- 帖子 #206 ---
From what I've seen in about a week of trading this method, the shift 3 is good - I think with a shift 2, you'd get knocked out way too easily. I've been knocked out of a few positions by the shift 3, but thankfully there's been enough real moves that I've been able to ride with it to more than make up for the losses.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
As i wrote.. Did NOT break the MA5. No trade.. Thanks MA.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
In this graph I would wait until MA confirms the trade, as in, the HA candle body turns red with the majority being below the MA. Trix already confirms the trade, but keep in mind price is above the Coral, so Trix alone would result in too many "fake" signals. Wait until a larger (5pips+) candle forms downwards through the MA I think it's really important that all the indicators (MA, trix, stochiastics, support/resistance) confirm eachother. Whenever there's "confusion" the move might not actually happen (strongly). Use the Trix as a base indicator and add the others as confirmation.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Agreed. I tested the shift 4 for fun, and it cuts your winners too much to be profitable by the way. Shift 3 really seems to be a good "middle ground". EDIT: This thread finally has the 5 stars it deserves

--- 帖子 #210 ---
buuut, after knowing the M5 development last 20 min. if you switch to M1 now, mhhh great short scalp ?!?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Wait until a larger candle forms heading south... Also, note that often moves are stronger if the cross happens at or close to the 0.00000 line on the Trix chart

--- 帖子 #212 ---
It's about time! I don't know if I'd be comfortable with shorting the EUR just yet... I mean, it has moved pretty far today, but I guess I'd like to see some PA confirmation before shorting it. Having said that, I don't know how much longer I want to stay up, it's already nearly midnight here

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Low 5 pip. It should be enough, but if you are greedy or a gambler, you still can wait and invest your 5 pips or sell the half or have a look at M5

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Forgot to mention, I think waiting until "everything" (incl. the MA) lines up helps greatly at cutting down on losses. Using this strategy I can almost afford to lose 5 trades in a row and still make up for it with 1 good winner. That's a great thing for my "mental health"

--- 帖子 #215 ---
After seeing the way the PA challenged (and failed to break) the previous high at the new hour, I think a short may definitely be on the cards fairly soon. Come on price action confirmation!!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
A lot of information. Thanks guys. Have to re read that later and answer on some posts again. Now, no more trading for me, enough for today and have to drive my mom to the hospital. glta

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Cheers Tora, have a good one I think that'll do me for today as well, thanks all!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Looks a divergence is forming at 1H chart. I am waiting a THV signal for confirmation to go short.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
What currency pair?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Sorry, it's EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
It also agrees Forex Cube's signal . (He is a weird Switzerland guy who has very high winning records.)

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hey...as a Swiss I object to calling us weird

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Not sure what divergence you're talking about, but it looks like a reversal will happen over the next few hours. Trix and Stochiastics are both extremely overbought...so I expect price to drop by 1/3rd to 1/2 of today's increase. Too early to jump in though, the bulls might still go nuts, better to wait for a decent confirmation.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks Toranaga

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Oops... I wanted to say he is brilliant but a little bit hot tampered. Anyway, he is nice enough to share his knowledge.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Nah, you're right...he's weird Interesting approach though.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks for linking this guy heispark, I'm curious to find out more about his strategy if he has such good stats!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Nice short setup for EURUSD and long setup for USDCHF (naturally as they are negatively correlated) on the H1 charts at the moment. Just hopped in a while ago and already 8 pips up in both cases...let's see how long the correction lasts.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I opened a short position on the EUR earlier when the price action was looking good - I didn't follow the rules though and set my stop at breakeven once it was in sufficient profit, rather than at the 5EMA. The price literally just ticked back up to my stop and then plummeted down to the 1.2430 area! Thankfully I didn't lose any money, but I may have just learned a lesson in following the rules

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Yeah...funny enough most of my larger losses are due to me messing up and ignoring my own rules. Often (although I'm working on that) I enter trades too late after price is already 15pips+ past the MA...so if it swings back your loss is larger. The perfect entry is somewhere between 5-10pips after price crosses the MA. I think DISCIPLINE is just as important as the system mechanics. It's my weakness and something I'm busy working on. Hell, I even bought a "Mindfulness" meditation book after reading that a TON of traders and hedge fund managers have great success with it. Jobs used to meditate every day before work...evidently it had some positive influence on his performance. Price is stalling a bit in both my trades but I haven't been kicked out yet so it's all good.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Looking at the Trix it seems the market is expecting negative news from the US...got kicked out of both trades. I generally don't trade that close to news releases, so for now I'm going long EURUSD and short USDCHF on my demo account

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I came across a brilliant article earlier today which talks about this (disciple as well as system mechanics) in detail. I'd particularly recommend this to people who are new to investing in CFD's and forex. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...17#post5280317 In other news, I think I'll sit out of the markets tonight: I can't see any really clear signals, and when in doubt, the best thing to do is nothing at all

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Yeah, it's weird...US news was mostly bad, yet the EUR isn't rising...probably already priced in from yesterday. Will sit out as well and reevaluate once the Asians start trading.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Guess my analysis was correct but my timing wasn't great...EUR promptly started rising after I posted this. Would have been a great 60pips+ trade. Sadly I have a fulltime job, otherwise I would have re-entered since all signals were still valid. By the way, pretty amazing how the Trix told you about the upcoming up move in EURUSD 7 hours (!!!) before it actually happened. Notice how when NYC opened the slow Trix was green and crossing through the slow one that also switched to being green? Stochiastics were also pointing upwards all the time and the only thing that kicked me out was the MA because it tested it 2-3 times before taking off. I think I'll try setting the initial stop loss to just below/above the closest Fractal support/resistance line in the future until a trade is X amount of pips in profit. Will run some tests on my demo account over the next few days. https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/FOMEC.png Another thing, if you look at the chart you'll notice that up moves seem stronger when price is above coral than down moves...something to take into consideration. Only enter short when price is above coral if the signalling candle is really strong!

--- 帖子 #235 ---
A possible short in H1 in the developing. Lets se what happens. Till waiting for the next one or two H1 candles for the entry (or not) there will be some great scalp opportunities in M1/M5 in the same time..

--- 帖子 #236 ---
20 pips lower since the last post. At the moment we reached last days High. nice to see by switching to M5. Depends of your trading style you could collect your effort now, or Close the half, or trust your skils and let the trade develop, with maybe trailing the SL..

--- 帖子 #237 ---
and now here we have it.. This outbreak came not surprisingly if you followed the PA the last hour. Depends how you managed your H1 trade, (best case you closed it or trailed it to BE ) you have now another winner in M5 long and profited twice Or youre still short in H1, there are still changes, but absorbed you possibly H1 loss with a fast M5 long if you have a hedge Account. Aso aso.. Love it today.. M5 M1

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I was there,too.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Nice job guys I made some pips trading USDCAD today, but due to work I missed the rest...oh well. By the way, mark the 12th September in your diaries...that's when they'll announce Greece dropping out of the Euro in my opinion. They also have to make a decision regarding Spain on that day, so we can all expect a few good moves.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Notice how an almost perfect exit point would have been the low point of the 2nd last Heiken Ashi bar (last green bar). Just asked in the platform tech section if someone knows of an automatic stop loss EA that works like that

--- 帖子 #241 ---
It's just a coincidence, nothing to do with experience or knowledge.I usually use cm ea or "move SL by mouse". However, I must admit that I spent a lot of time in trying to end trade as late as possible.Unfortunately, there are a lot of mistakes,too.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Fast Trix was in Extreme Oversold, plus it changed the Color so it WAS the perfect exit and a must at this point and after a such move..

And then the big flush. Predictable.. If you can see it. (you see, i switch often from D1/H1 to M5/M1, since i started that i improved my good trading. Only the lack of discipline is a problem now )

--- 帖子 #248 ---
And afterwards of course..

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Nice exit. Here or here...

--- 帖子 #250 ---
he he, thats cool. Nice trade. Somewhere completely elsewhere, making the same win trades on the same pattern..

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Just came home. Missed completely this nice 75 pips trade .. Perfect conditions: Entry: Trix Cross near Zero, PA above Coral AND MA5 Exit: Mine would be after PA breaks MA5. The first Fast Trix Color change would not bother me too much. Nice gain till then and PA still above MA. Would let it ride..

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi, Toranaga Wasn't the following also a good entry? Attached Image If you didn't take this, could you please tell me why?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
As i wrote, just came home and posted the chart. Missed trading today completely.. Simply oversaw the second signal.. But, having a look at it afterwards, i think i would think twice and would not take him. First, im always cautious going into a second long in M5 after the first was such a big runner.. Im mostly got punished doing that. M5 is much more trickier than M1.. (imo) And let suppose ive made this 75 pips +, that should be enough for today, why to risk it in M5.. Second, have a look where the Trix Cross is. As we know, WAIT for the Candle Close AFTER the Trix Cross. Afterwards its always difficult to catch and explain the PA behavior, (bacause now its static) but in my mind the PA was gone too far away. I would be afraid that he falls back below my entry.. Also notice the R3 Pivot and how it was respected by the first run.. That was maybe nice for a fast scalp switching to M1 after seeing that in the developing..

--- 帖子 #254 ---
And.. the same M5 Signal , zoomed in M1. As i said, a very nice M1 scalp opportunity.. And watch the small red M1 candle between. That was the part where all could fail. To risky in M5.. Afterwards. M1 Would wait the small Red to pass also then the next Green candle to close and then maybe a long trade.. Maybe.. when youre live you think different and are 'into the Game' Afterwards all is easy, thats why im often post live..

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Beautiful long EURUSD and short USDCHF set up today...wish my job wouldn't have prevented me from grabbing more than 50ish pips

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Thank you very much, Toranaga! It helped me a lot.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Thanks..

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Today is a good day I'm long GBPJPY, EURUSD and EURAUD...up around 88 pips so far riding the gravy train. Will post pics once I get back home tonight if no pub tour diverts me. By the way, for those interested in getting an overview of other timeframes all on the same chart, install a Fractal support/resistance indicator. It will show support/resistance lines for whatever timeframes you want. I trade solely on the H1 chart but have support/resistance lines for the H4 and daily charts too. Saves you a lot of trouble by not having to flick back and forth all the time.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Make that 137 pips Also, don't fall for the QE3 stuff, the market has already priced it in

--- 帖子 #260 ---
And I'm out...because I'm heading to the pub and don't want to think about it anymore. Plus 143 pips, happy days

--- 帖子 #261 ---
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/EUR...ust%202012.png I missed the perfect entry on this trade because of work but it still resulted in a nice 43 pip gain Reasons for trade: Price crossed through the moving average with the majority of the candle body being above the moving average. I could have entered just there, but I missed it. Price broke through the Coral, which made me enter even though I missed the first sign. Both Trix were green and the fast one was above the slow one. Stochiastics were green and pointing upwards with some room to go. I exited manually because price started stalling and I wanted to go to the pub. That decision saved me about 8 pips. Overall not bad. I have to learn to time entries after missing initial signs due to work commitments. I will also start testing a new automatic stop loss that sets the stop loss to the high/low point of the previous candle’s candle body (NOT the wick!). We’ll see how that goes. On one hand it might kick me out of the trade too much, on the other it might result in larger winners.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/EUR...ust%202012.png Still love EURAUD, it trends amazingly well…at least at the moment. The trade resulted in a sweet 49 pip gain, but I missed the perfect entry again due to work. Reasons for trade: Price bounced off the 1hr Fractal support for the second time (which showed me that this support is somewhat strong) and stayed above it. Price crossed the moving average with the majority of the candle body being above the moving average. I could have entered a bit earlier. Price was above the Coral. Both Trix were green and the fast one crossed upwards through the slow one. Stochiastics were green and pointing upwards…but already really close to the extremely overbought area, which should have set off alarm bells. This was an almost perfect setup. A strong upwards bias existed because price bounced off the Coral (showing that this is a strong support), bounced off the Fractal support (again, strong support), and the moving average. I exited manually again because I wanted to go to the pub and didn’t think about trading…

--- 帖子 #263 ---
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/GBP...ust%202012.png I don’t trade JPY pairs a lot (mostly use them as confirmation) but this time it worked out for a nice 36 pip gain. As with the other two trades today I missed the perfect entry by a few pips due to work. Reasons for trade: Price was below the Coral but price just came back from a crucial low point it previously hit on the 27th (123.75). Price bounced off the 4hr Fractal support line. Now the higher up you go in terms of Fractal support/resistance lines for various timeframes, the stronger those levels become. So I tend to trust H4 lines more than H1 lines. Price broke through the moving average with the majority of the candle body being above it. I could have entered earlier. Both Trix were green and the fast one was above the slow one. Stochiastics were green and pointing upwards with some way to go. Exited the trade manually…pub time By the way, in case anyone’s wondering why I haven’t posted any losses…I just didn’t have any interesting losses of more than 20 pips recently. I had a few fake moves due to extremely low volume (vacation season), but not a ton…and none of them were mistakes I could use to learn from. As soon as I mess up badly (and I’m sure I will) those losing trades will be posted.

My first find with my manual at the weekend scans. Here is a naked chart. I need one or two more candles for a direction for the coming week but i think its at the break point at the moment and few nice opportunities for some pip collecting are there yet now. Will stalk it. Please compare it with your THV setup and post me your opinion if you like.. (# of course with chart and circles )

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thanks Toranaga for opening this thread so that we can share our experience for using THV. I have been using THV for 2 year, my trading style like Cashmeer, and I earned some money from it. But the most things that make me fear and lost money is "range market". u could see it 2 day in last week. Can u share your experience ? how u can advoid to take trade in range market? how u realise them? THV is good system in trending market, but not in range market, I think not only THV but also every system, that is our problem. Hope to hear from everybody. English is not my mothertongue, so sorry for my bad english. Thanks

--- 帖子 #266 ---
You cant trade every move, you have to wait and whats a range market for one its a nice up and down for another. I never trade M15, dont like this TF. If you switch to M5 the same ('range') chart looks full of action. Lower your TF, lover you TP, look for another pair or simply dont trade.. Imo, there is never a range market, its only what you do or how you look at it.. And, i said that few times. Use the THV-Info panel with his great ATR display. Very usefull. Example, if the ATR is below 6 (better 8 or more) i dont trade M1 to weak PA, for M5 or higher, gaining experience at the moment. The same constellation im M5

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I donn't trade TF 15, but I use it to confirm trend at lower TF, I used to draw trendline that high TF from 15 - 30 - 1h - 4h, watch it to take trade at 1 - 5 TF. I donn't scalp like u. Thanks for info, I will check it on my own to find the appropriate rate of ATR to trade.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
And post it here please. It needs a lot of screen time to give a right answer.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
So I had a bit of time to test a few new indicators over the weekend. Generally I believe the fewer indicators the better...KISS (keep it simple stupid). I started out by removing all indicators I don't generally use much, and that freed up a lot of space (mostly in the Pipware dashbord). I then added 1 additional indictor, this one . It's main purpose is to keep me from trading when volatility doesn't support it...and initial tests show it ROCKS!! Doing some backtests you'll realise that it keeps you out of a ton of bad spots. My charts now look like this: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5156645/Chart%20Setup.png Whenever the green line of the volatility indicator is below the red line DO NOT TRADE. The chart above shows you those bad periods. It's as simple as that and should increase your win % by a lot

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks, informative post. Me too, doing the same by adding MA and SMAs to the chart Goal,, trading only with few MAs. And Ha Candles..

--- 帖子 #271 ---
btw. New week, forex opening. 3 pairs. If you knew before this patterns for this particular day, and have little helpers, it can be easy. Have a look.. Whats common.. try to compare it with THV. And impress some patterns..

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi, Ninja Do you also use Damiani at lower timeframes such as 5M? I also use this indicator but its performance is so-so for me. In my case, the angle of green line looks more important. When it moves upward, it looks we have a momentum. I use Damiani only at 1H+ TF. At lower FTs, it's useless I think.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
of course. We are here to help each other

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I think, keep it simple is better. Cobra have combine 15 indicator in the THV's trix. I think we donn't need to add more indicator. I test a lot of indicator in forexfactory which can divine in to category. - One is the indicator can show u very soon signal to entry, but it can be repainted. - the second donn't repaint but it show u late signal. I think our problem is to improve the method of use THV better, we should not chance it. I test a lot of system with many indicators and I must come back to Trix.Trix is the heart of this system, I think Trix is the best indicator.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
No I don't...but that's because I only trade H1. Haven't tested it for lower timeframes I'm afraid, but at H1 it works really well.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thank you for your quick feedback. I think I better check this indi again.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
It looks it wants go south... at least for a while. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course, it's a little bit early to make decision though.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Let me wait Trix signal before I shoot..... Attached Image

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I agree that Trix is probably the most important one. Having said that, Trix alone isn't enough and needs confirmation. Figuring out what indicator serves as the best confirmation sign is tricky. In the chart below you see that the THV system has a clear short bias for a few hours but price doesn't consistently trend south, so it's not time to enter (yet). The volatility indicator clearly states "DO NOT TRADE" too and seems to work perfectly. http://db.tt/dZVCVYym Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of indicator overload, but at least on the higher timeframes this one seems to rock. I mean, you can literally go back in time and see how many times it saves you from fake-outs, it's really quite amazing. By the way, I'm generally not trading the lower TF for 2 reasons: 1) I have a full time job. I just can't stare at charts for hours on end. 2) I believe large investment companies can really screw with price IN THE SHORT TERM which results in a higher number of "fake-outs" on lower timeframes. It's harder for them to do something that has a lasting effect unless it agrees with the market's general medium (aka H1+) term opinion. Less fake-outs is good for my piece of mind, I'm really only interested in larger moves of 30-150pips. Anything below that doesn't interest me. PS: Looks like EURUSD will go long soon, and USDCHF short. At least according to the H1 Trix. Too early to enter though according to the Damiani indicator...

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I couldn't see your picture. Post it again, please

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I'm at work and unfortunately most image uploading providers are blocked...I'll try to add it as an attachment. Explanations are below the image What I love about this new indicator is that it only takes 5sec to figure out if now is a good time to trade or not. If the answer is "yes" I start analysing the market according to the THV/Pipware rules outlined earlier...but if it's "no" I just move on to other pairs or take a break.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Still keeping me out of trades for EURUSD and USDCHF (and correctly so)...seems like a lot of sideways movement. Will be interesting to see if the markets buy Draghi's "hopium" message on the 12th. The only pairs that seem to trend well right now (albeit not a huge move) are AUDUSD and NZDUSD.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Made quick 9+ pips. Small profit but because Trix doesn't look pretty and daily analysis is EUR buy, I didn't go much. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Damn!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I suppose the white line is MA5. H1 PA broke the MA and the Daily pivot, and Trix wasnt so ugly.. If you trade H1 you have to wait much more and have greater SL.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I simply wait until price breaks 8pips or so through the moving average and then use the 5EMA (shift 3) as a trailing stop loss...works well on 1hr charts.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
he he, great idea. Use the Ma only for confirming Thv entry's. Till now.. But use Coral often for Exits or SL. btw, Coral is.. ?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
It looks good setup although CCI is a bit high... (I didn't take it anyway since I was fell in sleep.) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thank you for your advice. I am still learning...

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Coral is probably closest to a 60 MA. During ranging markets the Coral becomes almost irrelevant. During trending markets long moves tend to be stronger than short moves if price is above the Coral...and vice versa. By the way, Evernote is awesome as a trading journal. Started using 3 folders there, 1 for trades and notes, 1 where I update market bias for all pairs I trade, and one for news and theory.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
btw. what a killer move..

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Did you take it? Congratulations! By the way, it looks Daily S2 will be strong resistance... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
sorry, I forgot! Thanks u for post your analysis I try it yesterday, but the result not good. Still try it today.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
On what timeframe did you try it?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I have try ATR like u said too. It can warn u the market is weak or strong at the current time. But I see that when the market change to move strong the ATR begin to show the lagger number when price have gone very far the good entry, I think it is too late if u hesitate and follow it. consistent with THV rule (trix, ichimoku, coral and trendline) is my favourite at this time.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thats about, the bolted.. The Atr DONT give you entrys, it only says marked is on fire now, trade. So higher the Atr is, the better/accurater are the THV Signals. Nothing more, nothing less.. Or as a reminder, when i see a ATR 25 in M1 i know, there are some news out that i forgot

--- 帖子 #297 ---
^^^ Exactly! I'm using that Damiani indicator the same way. It doesn't tell me entries/exits but helps to confirm the other indicators and analysis. It helps me to better time my moves and stay away from short-lived "fakeouts".

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Sorry for late answer! I am too busy at his time becauce of my baby was born last week. I watch it on TF 15 and 1h. Perhaps it like the ATR, I think only follow THV' ATR indicator is enought for me.Thanks for your post about that indicator.

today is a range-day. so hope to see smthng like that

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Real life work's a bit of a bitch at the moment, so I don't have time for a lot of trading...work comes first Anyway, nice EURAUD short setup: - Price below the Coral. - Trix is red. - Stochiastics are red. - Candle broke through the moving average. - The next Fractal support line is far off. I should have entered earlier, but again, work was in the way...all on the H1 chart of course. Will post a pic once I get home tonight...can only access Metatrader on my phone at the moment.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
stopped out at -11 pips. it's so pity. guess done for today. coz a little bit nervous

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Not a bad day given I only had around 10min to look at charts today...+51pips this afternoon after a nice 17pip gain in the morning for a grand total of 68pips. The morning trade was EURAUD (short), and the afternoon trades were EURUSD (long) and USDCHF (short). First chart is EURAUD, second is USDCHF, third is EURUSD. Entries weren't optimal as I was at work...but all indicators and PA lined up still, so I went for it. Damiani is pretty good at showing you when you can still enter trades as momentum continues. Little fun fact: I haven't watched economic news in days, no clue why price moves...but I couldn't care less. All I know that Germany's voting tomorrow, but that's about it On a side note: If I was forced to remove every single indicator bar one I'd keep the Fractal support/resistance lines. After using them for a few weeks now I recon you could probably trade using nothing but them.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
By the way, notice how yesterday on the EURUSD H1 chart both Trix and Stochiastics suggested a short move...and price even broke though the moving average. However, if you check out Damiani you'll notice that it did a great job at keeping me out of a short trade that never really materialised. Fractal support/resistance also created a VERY narrow range, which is a sign that you should wait until it (finally) breaks out.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
GURU!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hahaha, I wish But it's nice to see that after all those hours of staring at charts and testing stuff it seems to pay off. The one thing I learned is that no books or "tutorials" can make up for testing stuff and identifying patterns yourself...even if that sadly means you have to spend hours glancing at (boring) charts. It's almost like playing a pretty boring and repetitive computer game. Funny enough I only very rarely considered it boring for some weird reason.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
It's part of the Pipware dashboard (free), but I'm sure there should be something similar floating around on Metatrader's "Codebase". Alternatively you could add the dashboard and disable everything bar those support/resistance lines. I tested Pivots, Fibonacci, and a whole bunch of different automatic support/resistance indicators...Fractals seem to work best for me, at least on the H1 charts. You can set different timeframes on the Pipware dashboard...so if you want support/resistance for M1/M5/M15 that's no problem...I'm using H1, H4 and D1. Lots of times the lines will fall together which means it's a strong level.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I'm long EURUSD and GBPUSD...and short USDCHF. Most of the German court ruling seems to be already priced in, but indicators line up on the H1 charts. Narrow stop loss at the 5EMA (shift 3) moving average, so can't really lose much if it goes against me. Tricky (news) day Up 14pips so far, but momentum seems to be dragging its feet a bit... EDIT: Kicked out of the GBPUSD trade, small 8pip loss EDIT: Closed manually as price seems to be stalling or even showing signs of reversal. Might hop in again later...down 17 pips today, oh well.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Tip: Check out EURAUD!! It's one of the best trending currency pairs around!

scalping the €/$ at the moment. My first loss. 0.5 pip 5 seconds after i closed, of course price went 15 in my direction. That hurts, but i have to think about the gain till then, and not whine about the unrealized profit, and - 0.5 pips is not so much. But, pity i missed the 15 pips mhhhh , he he Now, have to pause, the flow is broken. Usually after such a event if i jump in the next trade, i loose again.. and again..

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Saved by Jesus. That was a nice example for NOT following his own advice and being to greedy. Almost ruined a perfect scalping day.. It was not a sit and wait, there was a small chance to survive it, and i took it, switching M1-M5 back and fort and setting the SL to the pivots.. and using all the collected screen time scalp knowledge, he he And had luck..

--- 帖子 #324 ---
btw. have a look at M5. Not now, but if we break 1.2890 or so..

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Stupid question maybe (and you can bash me for asking since I'm not using THV's indicators), but why does it say "Trix Cross: BULL" when Trix clearly suggests a short move? I quit after my 17pip loss...crazy day at work.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Nice question, dont know. I never pay attention to this..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Trix cross bull = fast trix above zero level trix cross bear = fast trix below zero level In this situation trix does not suggest short move,yet,both trixes are above zero line.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thanks for the clarification

--- 帖子 #329 ---
btw. as said in the initial post, please post this kind of questions in the other thread or pm..

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Trix had done her Job well, not to forget its D1, not M1.. But that was also a nice Candle Sticks, Pivots, short trade after a such move, equal if M1 or D1 and this pattern.. Touching MA 220, then falling back to.. yep, to MR1 then bouncing and closing at MmR2 only to continue climbing the next day.. Ma220 as resistance today. Imo..

Sure, I will. Sorry for this...

12:30 PM Federal Funds Rate, FOMC Statement 100 pips difference and after 8 Minutes back where it started. M1, M5

--- 帖子 #334 ---
The range of the PA is getting tighter and tighter.. Stuck between Coral and S2.. Patience.. I expect a outbreak soon. M1 M5

--- 帖子 #335 ---
As i wrote the post above..

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Reaching q3S3.. I would say, now it enough.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Seems so.. M1 chart and M5 confirms it.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thats is how my trade would look.. M1 You see the 2 'fake' exits? Depends how much pips you are in plus you can exit there (safe) or wait and gamble for a MA or Ichi break If it does not happen, continue the ride.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Looking nice, but the price is sitting at the Coral. Wait and see what happens.. At least 1 M5 Candle.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
M5 looks promising, but switching to M1, hmmm No room for a quick scalp. At the moment.. But that should be a M5 trade So staying focused at M5 with a switch to M1 M15 from time to time..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
In the meantime, while waiting for M5 M1, long ?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Weak, will it last.. ?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Having in mind the supposed M5 direction (short) you cant except to much in M1 (long) equal what trix shows. But there is also room for a quick up. One M5 canlde IS 5 M1 candles..

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Again, in the meantime, our prior M5 short developed nice..

--- 帖子 #345 ---
btw. the M5 short is still rocking it. With the tendency to stop soon..

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Now ?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Went short EURUSD at 1.3070 once it broke through a strong Fractal support level...still in the trade at around 32 pips profit so far. Will remain in the trade as I kind of expect the Euro to continue a downward move until Spain asks for a bailout. Plus, price hasn't broken through my 5EMA shift 3 top loss trigger On a side note, if you have a bit of spare cash, buy "Hedge Fund Market Wizards". It's hands down the best trading book I ever read. Not because it tells you about systems, but because some of the greats talk about their "attitude" towards trading. Changed how I think about trading a lot, and it's probably the single book that improved my trading the most. Also made me not worry about losses anymore. Hilarious how some of the big players used to suuuuuuuuuuuuuck when they started out. The book is a great way to learn from their mistakes, and it provides hints and tips too.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
You meant Shift 2, isn it ? btw. the best addition in last years for the THV. The simple MA5.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Nope, using the 5 EMA shift 3 because it doesn't kick me out of moves as quickly. Agree on period 5 moving averages though...what do you use your 5 SMA for? By the way, I wouldn't be surprised if the EURUSD retraces all the way back to 1.2950...or close to it. As for stop losses in general, some guy just offered to create an EA for me that sets the stop loss to the low point of the candle body of the previous HA candle when going long, and the high point of it when going short. Did some test and it seems to work really well. Will run some side by side tests once I get it

--- 帖子 #350 ---
In my opinion.. NO EA can follow you 1 to 1 even 1 to 80%, successfully as a nice manual M1-M5 scalp system. Point. Done some EA tests with my system. Disappointing.. Nothing is faster as a Human Brain. F--k EAs Or the programmer, and you, are at God mode then maybe. But why a Ea if you can handle it manually. And have fun. What is all about.. Having fun. And being right.. And colecting pips. By my self.. And the knowledge you have..

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thats exactly about...

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I need an automatic stop loss because I have a fulltime job The 5 EMA shift 3 works well on the H1 timeframe. I took some trades on the M15 using the same system a while back and it worked too, but my sample size is way too small compared to H1. Looking at my last few trades using that Heiken Ashi stop loss EA works a bit better than the 5 EMA shift 3 (or shift 2 for that matter). You could of course do it manually. PS: Still working on god mode

--- 帖子 #353 ---
"because I have a fulltime job" Me not, thankfully "The 5 EMA shift 3 works well on the H1 time frame." Amazing, ALSO IN M1 OR M5 Or Daily. "PS: Still working on god mode" Me too, close to it, but still dont have it..

I'm long USD and short EUR/GBP/AUD/CHF today, up 46pips so far, happy days By the way, if you're too lazy to figure out how fundamentals might influence your trades, check out the Open Interest rate. It tells you how the "smart money" invests, and does a decent job at giving you hints about when they start buying/selling. This is obviously only useful for H1 and above.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Got out of all trades because I'm happy with today's profit of 85 pips Should have gotten out when I was up 110pips, a $1k day would have rocked...but I learned not to be greedy, the market punishes you if you are

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Dammit!! Generally the Asian session consists mostly of consolidation phases, but it seems there were some beautiful moves going on over night this time On the H1 charts price broke through the coral in EURUSD yesterday, then retraced back towards it during the late afternoon and evening...just to then crash again at night. Wish I didn't have to sleep

--- 帖子 #357 ---
If price stayes above S2 then looking for Long..

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Morning, same here, i was quit suprised when i woke up.. but im still happy that i got good sleep!!

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Same here, need my sleep. Either way, the Spanish bond auction's today, so we should get some decent moves. The only problem I see is that the down move might already have been priced in over night, so moves today might be muted. Price is also below the coral on the H1 chart, which makes me a bit more hesitant to go long today. We'll see

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Yeah i just follow system, im ready to go short anytime.. but right now my long doesnt look very good.. Lets see

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Whenever price is below the Coral long moves are pretty short lived anyway until a trend reversal (which would be indicated by other indicators anyway).

--- 帖子 #362 ---
On another note: As some of you know I am in touch with a programmer who will produce an automatic stop loss EA for me. When going long, it will set the stop loss to the previous HA candle's low point (candle body or wick, you can chose!)...and the high point when going long. Some initial tests show a lot of promise. While it does kick you out of trades a bit more than the 5 EMA shift 3, it also allows you to lock in profits more consistently...and you can always re-enter if indicators signal a continuation. The EA costs $45. I'll pay that either way, but if anyone of you wants it, feel free to PM me and chip in a few $

A nice Long in the developing, all i need for a long is there, only maybe the WPV 1.3016 could make some trouble, have to have a close look when we are in the range.. Now, wait for the next Candle. I thought..

--- 帖子 #367 ---
But, the next Candle Thats, why it is so important to WAIT for the Candles to close, even better to be a little late in the trade than to early..

It's a fake out I think Damiani says "DO NOT TRADE" which is the first sign. It's also a typical "Judas" swing...aka smart money wiping out stops of people who were short since Friday. I expect another swing like that on London open...maybe even as high as 1.6260 before dropping down again.

Im short in GBP/Usd on Daily basis at the time i wrote the post. What i wanted to show was this nice (and expected) Up breakout. In H1. I like to find such breakout possibilities, switch to lower TF, wait for the move and then trade it in M1 or M5.. If it comes.. Did not lasted long, but 25 pips are 25 pips Afterwards, the posted H1 'fake out' as M5 chart. The 2 vertical lines mark the one H1 candle. :nerd:

New week. Finaly. What do you think. I would say.. smal test lot, sun-mon Candles are unpredictable.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Well, the majority of smart money seems to go short USD and have cut their short positions in Europe. I went short EURUSD and long USDCHF this morning, 50+ pips gain per trade. It seems to be turning around though, so I'm out of those trades now. Fundamentally there's so much mixed news at the moment, I mostly focus on H1 charts (THV, Damiani, daily/monthly pivots) and try to ignore fundamentals. If price is below the daily mid-pivot and indicators suggest I should buy, I do just that. If it's above the mid-pivot I only look for sell signals. Started doing that last week, and it seems to work great. Just goes to show, looking at indicators in isolation doesn't work, but if you group them and use them to confirm each other, it seems to work quite well. EURUSD, EURAUD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD are all above the daily pivot, so I'm now only looking for shorts after the recent up move. USDCHF and USDCAD is below the daily mid-pivot, so I'm only looking for long trades. For now it hasn't fully turned around yet, so I'll be patient

--- 帖子 #386 ---

It's all bout fake signals today??!!!! I got an advice from someone to ignore news which is not important. but sounds the only thing moving the market news and noobs. Didn't catch good entry till now...., the attachment for 5 min only and other Tf;s conflict with each others..

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Yeah, EURUSD cant decide wich way to go. Its on 38,2 Fibo.. Im looking strong close over Daily R1.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Price is playing around 50 Fibo, looking for Short when TRIX turns red But i dont like that Price closed above R2..

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Looking EURUSD. Price is between D Pivot and W R1, Fibo 50 and 61.8. Price is near 5 SMA and under 20 SimpleMA. I would go long if Price moves above 20 SimpleMA. Because Fast TRIX turned green and there is bullish divergence.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I'm not trading non-farm payroll days...especially not that close to the election. Why? I expect a lot of volatility that messes with charts. On one hand the dollar should rally if results are better than expected, on the other hand those good results are bad news for Romney...and the markets would consider a Romney win better for assets in the SHORT TERM (because as we all know no one gives a rat's ass about the long term consequences). So a worse result might actually boost the dollar because some fools still believe Romney stands a chance. Taking the day off Hate having to deal with politics interfering with economics...

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yeah, my approach is just to trade technical info right now. Im aware about coming news but im still learning how to use fundamentals and technicals together. But i must admit that your approach is smarter now.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
What you'll get is a lot of stop-loss hunting by smart money...there are enough better opportunities later this month. Sometimes not trading is the best approach. Knowing when to stay away can be the most profitable knowledge

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Heh, turns out I'm bad and went long EURUSD and short USDCHF...up around 20pips on both trades. Will probably close in 1hr10m once London closes. Pretty good week with a net gain of +4.9% using really strict risk management.

Morning everyone, im looking at EURJPY. H1 Price is on under 5 SMA but on 20 MA and D Pivot. I look shorting it only if Price closes strongly under D Pivot and 20 MA. Last Hourly candle was weak closed on D Pivot. Now if i look at H4 i see Price is on 5 SMA wich dont favore Hourly Short trade because Price have before found 2 times support on 5 SMA and if it is third time it would be nice Long trade considering H1 20 MA Support and D Pivot Support+ H4 5 SMA Support. Lets see what happens...

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Shorted EURJPY at 102.18

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Interesting At the moment exact at 102.00

--- 帖子 #402 ---
And secret lies Here and Round nr.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Trade update. On H1 chart Price closed under D S2 witch should mean that Price can move also to S3. Only Problem is 50 Fibo witch is realy strong S or R most of the times. If it breaks it i surely see it moving to S3. And there where also strong move through W Pivot. Lets sit tight and wait..

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Closed my Short trade after it crossed 5 SMA at 101,54 +64 pip

--- 帖子 #405 ---
GBPUSD is holding just above 1.6000, but on the H1 charts it seems Trix suggests further down moves are likely...same for Stochiastics. Will wait until it breaks through this major psychological barrier, but for now I'm tempted to buy into the short bias. Loved the EURUSD move this morning...and the obviously correlated counter-move in USDCHF. The tube to work got stuck this morning though, so I missed half of that move.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi , I missed that short fully. My alarm clock didnt want cooperate with me . That move was bounch from H4 5 SMA. But now im Short from 101.28 because R on 101.35. Bad thing for me is that 50 Fibo is Still holding on but on H4 Price is belove 5 SMA and 20 MA.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Ok Price moved thorough D1 moved my SL to BE. Right now Price is near 38.2 Fibo and 100.65 line wich is taken support from D or W Chart. But im waiting Price to move at least to M Pivot and W S1.(100.62-100.56 zone)

--- 帖子 #408 ---
For people trading on the H1 or higher timeframes, I found a pretty cool way to set stop losses: Exit trades once the majority of the candle BODY (not just the wick!!) breaks through the 5 EMA (shift 3!) in the opposite direction of your trade. What you'll notice is that some trades might go against you because smart money has fun with their stop loss hunting, but it mostly falls back after a few minutes of that crap. Having great success with this so far as it allows me to stay in trades longer without falling pray to their annoying stop loss hunting. In the past that crap kicked me out of trades. Those annoying trend interrupting spikes happen mostly between 7am-9am, 12pm-1:30pm, and during the Asian open...using London time as a base. Got sick and tired of them so tested a few solutions over the past few days. I'll post some examples when I get home. If you want to have a look yourself, check out EURUSD when price dropped steeply just to briefly spike back up to c. 1.2965 before crashing again on the H1 chart. Previously that spike would have kicked me out, but I stayed in the trade which resulted in more pips. It's pretty fun because you get to see how the smart money messes with the rest of us I'll have a proper stop loss EA using those settings sometimes later this month...

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I have to say Thank You already because i got this idea to use MA from you and it works like a treat. There isnt anything nicer than not jittering about every small Price move because you have certain way to exit.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Yup, and the cool thing is just like the base system it works on all pairs...well, I think so at least, I'm trading 8 pairs For more about how the smart money messes with us, check out the "Innercircle Trader" Youtube channel...brilliant videos with a ton of content that's applicable for our system. Also a great source to learn about how to use Fibs in relation to it

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Ooh tnx man creat Find! Nice, tonight movie paylist is fully changed for evening Forex education.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Notice how waiting for the majority of the candle body (not wick) crossing the EMA allows you to capture larger swings...and more pips? I am actually wrong...if you had exited the trade when price touched the EMA, you would have made 15 pips...yay. Using the other method you'd still be in the trade with over 90pips in profit. Worth it imo By the way, if you wouldn't require sleep or had an EA using this strategy, you'd be up slightly above 330pips trading EURUSD since 1st October...without a single loss too!!

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Forgot to mention, this SL make some of the smaller winners even smaller. So instead of 15 pips you sometimes only gain 7-8 or break even...but I'm mostly after larger breakouts, so that's ok. Backtests showed that overall those breakouts make up for the decrease in some of the smaller gains. So instead of results like this: +20 +15 +30 +12 +41 +18 You will get this: +10 +6 +10 +90 +105 +1 Good trade-off imo Obviously using H1 charts as an example as I don't trade anything else unless I'm really bored and can't help myself (bad habit, trying to stop that). I will probably use the regular EMA SL (kicks you out when price touches the EMA) during times when moves are shorter and the new version during strongly trending markets and longer moves.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Since i started to do that, i even doubled my pip gains and became much more self confident. Sometimes i also wait for the Candle to completely close. As i wrote few week ago here, i love the MA5 btw. thanks guys for your quality posts here. Have a lot of work at the moment so i dont post so much, but i see light at the end of the tunnel..

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Same here. Also, since I now only enter trades while price is still fairly close to the MA (10-15pips tops), my losses are always fairly small. Just takes discipline to not enter too late just because you're pissed off from missing an opportunity...there's plenty of opportunities, so there's really no reason to force it a trade. Back and forward testing on demo accounts rocks too before implementing it live. Since forcing myself to back test stuff for c. 2k candles and then letting it run on a demo account for a while I hardly get bothered by losses anymore because I KNOW that strategy works. It's a very robotic way to trade, but it really helped me to "stay sane". My next goal is to somehow figure out what I could use to signal whether I should use the EMA stop loss or the "majority of candle body" stop loss. Must be some volatility based indicator I guess. The main reason for trying to come up with a signal indicator is that I am working towards full automation. If the strategy works in a non-discretionary way when trading it manually, it should also work with an EA. Should have a working exit EA soon, but the entries are a bit more complex. Trading EURUSD and EURJPY for 2 months (Aug/Sept) you would have made around 3.9k pips between those 2 pairs...with very few small losses that get balanced out by minor winners. The best month would have been September EURUSD on the H1 charts with 19 trades in total (1 loser of 15 pips). There were an additional 5-6 trades that ended up being +/- 10pips on average, but those happen every month and tend to balance themselves out. Of course that's assuming you're awake 24hrs for 5 days per week...and yeah, that's not realistic because I need my sleep and since I'm human I still enter too late sometimes even though it goes against my own rules. It's the main reason I want to implement it as an EA. Tired of waking up going "damnit, I would have totally taken that trade" By the way, the EMA trailing stop I use is this one (no6): LINK PS: Hope your work load eases up a bit soon...pretty hectic on my end too, so it's a bit of a challenge to trade, test stuff, and still focus on my main priority (work &amp; social life).

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Funny day...my Damiani volatmeter says "thou shalt not trade" for all but 1 pair (and that one isn't giving me a clear direction), so I haven't entered any positions even though most of the other indicators suggest I should trade. Wise decision so far, no real momentum going I see

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Closed my Short trade at 100.78 +50 pips and im long right now from 100.72 because 6 candles wich moved back from blue box to above M Pivot and W R1. Also Price is staying above 5 SMA and 20 MA. Fast TRIX ARE already crossed 0 Line and Slow TRIX is moving that way.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I won't enter a EURJPY trade until price breaks through that stubborn H1 fractal resistance level. Damiani's volatmeter shows the green line to be significantly below the red line...which suggest the momentum just isn't there (yet). By the way, I'm not saying you're wrong. It's just that I started to wait until momentum supports my entries. Helped me a lot in cutting down on "fakeouts".

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Yeah ihave also looked at Damiani Volatmeter but doesnt want too many indicators on my chart but it seems to be good . You cant be wrong in trading you just can be on wrong side of Order Flow and TRIX is showing me that there is bigger chance for long breakout but lets see whats happens

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Just broke through the H1 fractal resistance level...but given how high Trix and Stochiastics are I doubt it'll go far above 101.20

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Yeah actualy im not surprised if it stops on D Pivot but now im looking at H4 chart and i want to see can it close above 5 SMA.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Aaaaaaaaand it bounced off the Coral My guess (and it's only that, not putting any money on it) is that it'll retest the 100.45ish level again before taking off...if it takes off. Alternatively it will slightly overshoot the Coral, retrace back to it, and then take off. If that happens I will buy after the bounce. On a side note, Goldman Sachs recommends people go long EURAUD...which kind of makes me wanna do the exact opposite despite AUD's weakness. Their head forex guy is a complete tool who is wrong more often than he's right...at least in terms of what he tells people. Probably because they love betting against clients and muppets.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Yup...EURJPY isn't breaking through the Coral just yet. Stochiastics turned red, Trix is already pretty overbought, Damiani still prevents me from entering a trade in the first place, and the candle pattern on the H1 chart also suggests it's just not time (yet). It'll probably consolidate a bit during the Asian session unless those monetary minutes (JPY) and machine orders somehow mess with price. They aren't strong news events though, so I wouldn't be surprised if it just ranges a bit over night. Should give Trix a chance to "catch breath" and to hover down to the oversold region again. That way there should be some momentum to make the push tomorrow. Haven't entered a single trade today...doesn't happen often.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yeah moved SL to BE on my Long trade. Now out for some drinks..

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Trying something new Until the end of the month I will be in trades 100% of the time. My stop loss will simply be a trade signal in the opposite direction of my current trade. Until there is no exit signal (so for example, if I'm long I will stay long as long as there's no clear short signal), I will also continually increase my exposure whenever I get an additional entry signal. Once I get a trade signal in the opposite direction of my current trade(s) I will exit ALL those trades at once. Obviously this works best in trending markets, but since I'll be staggering my trades (aka "building legs"), my risk of the last few trades before a trend changes isn't all that great while I can keep winners running as long as possible. My risk/trade will obviously have to go down a bit as my August to October back test on EURUSD showed that sometimes you can end up with 10 simultaneous trades during an extended swing. Results seem crazy good though with 18 winners and 4 losers during that period. The maximum drawdown was around 105 pips (3 of the 4 losers happened within 4 trades). Small sample size though, so I'll have to do more extensive back testing before taking it live. My live account will stick to the EMA stop loss until I had a chance to also forward test it Use this for TRENDING pairs!

EURJPY hit W Pivot yesterday after that moved to 5 SMA and found Support then moved Higher and made Lower High. 5 SMA was also 50 Fibo and Thuesday Hi Low Fib Ext 61,8 then moved to Ext 100 and back to 61,8. Yesterday Hi Low 23.6 acted as R and Price formed small Gravestone Doji on M15 chart. TRIX is red and fast one crossed 0 line. Right now just looking Price and waiting for London Open. If i look at Higher Timeframes im more on long side because Price is above 5 SMA AND 20 MA but there could be small move back to 5 SMA or 20 MA after yesterdays big move. Looking for next H4 Close.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I'm long EURUSD and short USDCHF...for the past few hours that is I have to admit, adding that Genesis matrix tape indicator is pretty cool...helps at confirming THV signals together with Damiani. You get slightly less signals, but those you get are all higher probability trades. Took me around 5hrs over the weekend to figure out decent settings for that Genesis indicator on the H1 charts. On the upside, the same settings seem to work for all 8 pairs I trade. For the avoidance of any doubt, I only use this indicator to confirm THV signals...so THV is still my base system. Screenshot below...doesn't take a rocket scientists to figure out what the entry signal is Enter if: - Trixs are both green/red (depending on trade direction) - THV lines up - Damiani's green line &gt; red line - Genesis matrix tape = green or red (depending on trade direction) - Price broke through the 5 EMA (shift 3) in the direction of your trade. - Preferably: Price bounces off support/resistance or clearly beaks through. Once 15pips of profit have been achieved, my stop loss is automatically set to break even. Back tests showed that most of the time you can achieve at least 15pips profit even if for some reason (news!) the signal gets overturned and price then goes in the opposite direction. Most of the trades that would have been losers are converted into BE trades if you follow that rule. I don't set any other stop losses and exits are solely based on indicators. Exits: - Both Trix turn the opposite direction (so both turn red if in a long trade) - Daminani's green line &lt; red line - Genesis tape turns red if in a long trade, and green if in a short trade Either of those 3 conditions would trigger an exit, they don't all have to be fulfilled. In the above example I would have entered earlier...but I was on the tube

Hi guys, been a while since I've posted here, but it's good to see you're still at it! I must say, I'm impressed by some of the discussion, systems and trades throughout this thread in recent weeks. How have you guys gone with the volatility over the last 24 hours within the euro? I'm hoping you went long the EUR ^_^ As for me, I'm going to look into some of these new indicators you've been using 4exNinja, that genesis tape and damiani look like great supports to your adaptation of THV. I'll try to post some setups here over the next few days once I've gotten back into the swing of things! Happy trading

You feel like a complete donkey afterwards. I mean, setup even has a "DO NOT TRADE" or "TRADE" writing directly on the chart...which I promptly ignored. I also exited trades after price moved against me when all my indicators told me it's just a short term move. I guess it happened because of stress at work, I am normally pretty disciplined...which makes this f***up even more annoying On a positive note, the money doesn't bother me (yay for proper money management), I just HATE to be wrong PS: I have a post-it saying "don't be stupid" on my monitor at home...can't have it at work though...

Up 35pips on my USDCHF long trade (bastard took a while to take off) and 52pips on my short EURUSD trade...happy days Update: Make that 48 and 70pips...no clue what just happened.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Today's trades...happy days Technically I should still be in this trade but unfortunately I broke my phone this morning trying to switch off the alarm so no remote trading for me until next week. Pretty gutted because tomorrow should be a fun day with lots of movement On the plus side, real life work's going great and this year's bonus should allow me to trade full lots as of next year Btw, could have entered a candle earlier on both trades...but missed the sweet spot... Either way: Trix green/red, price above/below coral, broke through fractal support/resistance or bounced off it, price above/below MA, Damiani says "trade", and the "tape" is green/red. Can't get much more perfect. By the way, thanks Toranaga for making this thread...it's good to discuss trades with likeminded people

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I also went in on this trade, however I was at work from the London open onwards, and closed out about an hour and a half after the UK session began. Still managed to pick up 15 pips, but dear me if I was still in now, I would be up around 120 pips I'm thinking that I might need to start opening multiple positions and closing 1 early when I'm satisfied with it, and then perhaps setting a breakeven SL on the other(s) and seeing what happens.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
You have several options: 1) Use a trailing stop that trails the 5EMA (shift 3). 2) Use a trailing stop at the bottom of the previous HA candle when long, and the top of the previous candle when going short. 3) Get out of the trade once the slow Trix changes color. 4) Get out once Damiani's green line crosses the red line downwards. 5) Use support/resistance as stop loss. 6) Close 50% of the position once you hit a certain target. ... Tons of options All my trades are set to BE once they're 15pips in profit...and none of my losses are larger than 15-20pips.

Bah, missing all nice moves because my damn phone's broken...no remote trading. Could pull out my hair

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Love my Samsung Galaxy S3, iPhone's are too restrictive for my liking (and Google Now kicks Siri's ass). Either way, it wasn't the phone's problem. Had a long networking event until 1am the night before and threw it off the bedside table when I got annoyed the next morning when the alarm went off. Cracked my screen a bit...will be repaired by the end of the week though.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Not one both were too early.. I entered both trades with my THV rules, but i always forget trading D1, its D1 not M1 scalping.. GBP/NZD ended like this. Perfectly hit the SL then turned. AUD/NZD he he, SL maybe to a accurate, but turned, now i will it ride to the end.. Have to work at my setting the SL D1 capabilities. Or be more generous..

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Check out EURAUD, it often trends very well and overall seems to work great with THV (at least at the moment).

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I said i will ride the AUD/NZD till the end, but because few hours after i posted that the price still did not managed it to break the WPV 1.2598, lurking about .2598 and .2605 i decided to close the trade (10 pips + ) for a 2 days trade. Had a check early in the morning then, still 1.2603 Now almost 12 hours later 1.2610. Still did not managed it. Was the right decision. For me itsstill seems that is a nice short in D1, but this time i will wait till we break the WPV (AND MA5) and stay there. For at least ONE day ! The charts in H4 for a better understanding.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
That looks nice. GBP/NZD W1 and D1

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Possible setup on the EUR/USD... looking like a short to me but I'd like it to break that very strong support we can see on the white line at around 1.2890. Gotta work tonight, but hopefully I can watch it on my phone and make some money while I'm working to make money Peace

--- 帖子 #466 ---
H1 With 1.2961 at the moment we are very close to the Weekly Pivot plus the Channel Resistance Line and the MA5 are almost congruent. On daily im still waiting for a Long confirmation, but at H1 i would say we could expect some drop here. We will see..

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I've been short USDCHF and long EURUSD (correlation ftw) since the early morning...up around 35pips per trade on both. No clue what the charts are doing as I don't have a phone/tablet until later this week and I can't log on from work. Stop loss has been automatically set to break even, hopefully it doesn't turn around before I get home

Hello there good people! I regret to report that I ended up taking the bait yesterday and pre-emptively going short on the EUR/USD... lost a good 35 pips on that trade because I set a SL and then had to go to work, so couldn't manage the trade properly I have that donkey feeling you were talking about recently 4exninja! In other news, I'm thinking about a long position on the EUR today, for two reasons: - THV's fast trix has turned green and is on the upturn - GMTS tape has turned blue - Damiani is not quite yet at the "trade" condition, but it's looking likely that it will soon. - Fractal resistance is being heavily pressured (in fact as I'm writing this it's actually being broken) I've got two small positions open on this trade, one that I will close when I see an exit signal (such as the tape turning red), and one that I'll leave a SL for at BE if/when I get to 15 pips profit - and see where it goes from there. Here's hoping we have a good session of trading!

Hello Friends, Entered little late in USDCHF. but potantial one I am using only 15m time frame. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Nice one man! Based on the analysis I've done, I think your trade should work well Hopefully the market agrees with the both of us! What are the rules you usually follow for entering trades close to previous lows or highs? EDIT: Also just watch that weekly pivot for the USD/CHF trade, it's getting awfully close to it!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hello friend... My conditions are simple... I never look pivots and previous top bottom for entry. I used top,bottom(fractals) for placing exit. I enter short here on based on 1. Trix- both red 2. Coral down 3. Euro session ... Near to breakeven...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Awesome, thanks for sharing your ideas! I think often a simple set of rules are easier than a complicated one. I've set my trades to stop out at BE, currently up around 21 pips each, so happy days here so far!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I'm long too for pretty much the same reasons. And yeah, can't adjust trades at work either until the end of this week (when my tablet arrives), so I know the feeling of having to watch your profits evaporate. The "set SL to BE at 15pips" thing really helps though as most of the time once signals line up price seems to at least go your direction that much. Discipline is key, the system works, you just need to stick with it

--- 帖子 #476 ---
All positions got breakeven.... nearly 200 pips .... nice trading day

Hello friends... I want to test this THV in gold pairs... can any body suggest that which broker providing currency cross with gold eg: XAU/EUR or EUR/XAU, XAU/EUR or USD/XAU, XAU/USD or GBP/XAU, XAU/GBPor JPY/XAU, XAU/JPYor JPY/XAU, XAU/AUD or AUD/XAU Thanks in advance Arun...

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I'm with Oanda and am happy. They offer gold and CFDs too. Payouts are quick and they're fully regulated. Never had any real issues with execution time or spreads ...probably because I have a look at spreads before entering a trade, helps to prevent stupid news spreads of 10pips

--- 帖子 #481 ---
That's some serious work man - well done! I went in with two of my normal sized positions, so I guess I could argue that I'm up 40 pips overall at the moment... I considered closing one position out at 30 pips up for that particular trade, but looking at things from the 4-hourly or even daily perspective makes me hesitant to close out, and keen to look for more long profits over the next couple of days. I think I'll go ahead and close my first position when I see a clear exit signal on the 1-hourly chart, and hold the second position and see what happens. In fact, now that I look at it, the daily chart has made a solid break through the 5EMA above the coral, with fast trix turning green. It's also sitting above a positive trendline (these things I like for this long position!) Here's a screenshot of my 4H chart:

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hello Friend ... Your Idea is great. But I differ from yours. I look and trade only based on 15m timeframe. so I wont look higher timeframe. If our THV system shows next entry, I will take that. Otherwise no entries...

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thank you friend... I will look over that...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I have completely dumbed down my exits. If the tape (using 5/5/3 settings for anything but Gann) switches colour in the opposite direction (red when long, green when short) of my trade I exit...otherwise I stay in. Great way to capture larger moves, but during erratic markets you'd get into trouble if I wasn't using that 15pips-breakeven stop loss. Will have an EA for that (including initial stop loss and break even settings) in around 2 weeks I guess. Entries are of course mostly based on THV bar adding Damiani and making sure the "tape colour" confirms THV. What I now get is a string of breakeven trades, very few losses above 15pips, and a nice amount of larger 35-120pip winners. This ensures I never have any large drawdowns and I can honestly say losses don't bother me at all anymore unless it's because I wasn't disciplined enough PS: Up 74pips today...and this is the first week I trade 0.8 lots/trade...so happy days

Bah, got kicked out of my EURUSD trade at break even. Hate not being able to manage trades manually at the moment...brutal to watch profits evaporate At least all of those trades surpassed the 15pip threshold, so I can't lose anything today. Keep posting those charts so I actually know what's going on Still long EURJPY and short USDCHF...but I don't know if signals still support that, can't check

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Oh well...all trades closed at break even (+ spread). So annoying to be up 75pips+ and then not being able to exit trades when you want to

I'm trading the same direction...up 85ish pips shorting EURUSD and going long USDCHF. Happy I didn't fall for the early morning fake-out. I was about to enter in the wrong direction when I noticed price started to stall...happy I was patient enough to wait. THV for the motherf****** win On a side note: Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 + Remote RDC + Server running MT4 = awesome!!!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Looks like price is stalling a bit in anticipation to the US guys waking up from their hangovers (winning drinks or losing drinks...they'll all have a hangover). Still up 93pips though, moved stop losses within 15pips of the current price because trading full lots 93pips is a pretty decent amount...and I don't wanna lose too much anymore. Still getting used to trading higher amounts. Funny how making 100pips before giving up 20 didn't bother me when I was trading smaller sizes...but suddenly losing $200ish after winning is bothering me. Need to get to terms with that as in % terms nothing really changed, and it never bothered me before.

Exited all trades because I'm ready to go to the pub...ended up with 87pips after giving up a few.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Congrats. For me it was a Zero Day. Have fun.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I had a 38pip loss yesterday because my damn server went down and I couldn't edit anything until I got home (also didn't help that those trades should never have taken place, the slow trix was still green when I entered). A zero day beats a losing day, so I wouldn't be angry about it if I were you. On a side note, I don't get how people can trade based on fundamentals in today's screwed markets. Politics and central planning are messing with them to the extent where guessing how people will react equals flipping a coin...unless you take a long term approach.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Funny how undecided the market is today. One one hand you have the US fiscal cliff scaring people (so you'd expect the dollar to plunge), but one the other hand you have Germany who doesn't want to approve the EUR care package (so you'd expect the dollar to plunge until they do). Hopefully that EU summit will come up with some nonsense "hopium" message today so that EUR rallies a bit providing us with pips. If that doesn't happen, it's likely going to be a pretty annoying ranging day. I think EUR wants to go lower but is prevented from doing so because of US fiscal cliff fears...at least for now.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Yes, quite a pristine setup...It's interesting to see on this chart, that if one consider only the second setup... here the trix cross has occurred way below the zero line, allowing to "collect" only about half of the amount of the pips ...if one strictly adhere to the rules and waits for the cross.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Yes ! exactly. plus, that is a nice example what THV can and cant. And how to avoid traps. Even in H1. And its still not over..

--- 帖子 #517 ---
NZD/JPY D1 If you zoom out, what a nice pattern. Perfect trix cross, but somethings says to me, i have to wait..

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Also, a very cool H4 pattern. Lets see..

Indeed a nice setup...even more, the yesterday PA went above the previous fractal, so regarding this rule, the larger uptrend resumed.

Bought EUR and sold USD this morning...up 73 pips spread out over 3 trades. Also had a USDCAD and GBPUSD trade but they rallied up 15pips before kicking me out at break even. Happy days Trades closed...networking event at the pub, don't want to think about it while I'm busy drinking...

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Once again I'm long EUR and short USD and AUD. Up 57 pips so far despite a negative GBPUSD trade (stupid pound caused every single loss I had this week). They'll probably come out with a statement saying "we're working on it, Greece solution expected next week" message as they've done for months now...and I expect the Euro to continue moving up a bit because of that. All stop losses have been set to break even, so worst case I make nothing today

THV'ians...quick question: Do you use trade management EAs? If so...which ones? I'm working on one myself, but would be grateful for some additional inspiration

--- 帖子 #527 ---
No, i dont use them, but experimented with CaveManager very powerful, but not sure if it is bug free. It seems it is, but had some odd behavior while tested it. Or maybe i only miss-configured it.. Worth a look..

--- 帖子 #528 ---
A few people have asked...and I've been slacking off in terms of replies I'll create a zip file with all indicators and a template/profile over the coming days. Will have to pull it off my server as I don't have a local copy. PS: Calm day so far, I'm long EURAUD as the AUD seems to be tanking a bit. Using a tight stop loss though as Damiani tells me not to trade on most pairs this morning...probably waiting until the EUR summit comes up with some decent news.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Damiani says "TRADE", so 4exNinja is trading... Long: EURUSD, EURAUD Short: USDCHF Thanks for the Cave Manager tip, great little EA. Testing various settings on my demo account today, seems to be working ok so far.

Shitty sideways moving day...comon' people, make those pairs move, I want $$$

--- 帖子 #531 ---
indeed..

--- 帖子 #532 ---
On the upside, days with a narrow range like that are usually followed by some nice strong breakouts...so hopefully that'll make up for my crappy 14pip loss of today. Cave manager for the win I guess, saved me today and put quite a few trades at break even after it gained a few pips. I think I'm going to create 2 cave manager profiles...one for trending markets, the other for ranging markets.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Phoned with my girlfriend. Long. Just hung up. Wanted to write the same.. Have a look at H4. MVP 1.2973 it the invisible Wall at the moment. It 'seems' the nice strong breakout it quite near to happen.. ps. Glad you like CM. Know you will find it useful..

Have a lok at NZD/JPY Who can tell me what we are waiting for. Equal if H1, H4 or D1 ?? Even M5 shows it..

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Looks like a pullback to the Coral is about to happen...211ish pips according to the D1 chart if it pulls all the way back. Quite some volatility in that pair though looking at the H1 charts, would require quite a decent stop loss if you want to capture the entire move. On an unrelated note: Am I the only one who's baffled at the Euro guys saying "yup, here's the bailout money...and that's what we're going to do with it"...yet they don't mention where that money will come from? That's like me saying "I'm gonna buy a Bugatti Veyron...tomorrow...don't ask where I'll get the money from".

4exNinja 100 Points Im waiting for a nice D1 short if the 67.30 Weekly Pivot gets broken.. Maybe tomorrow..

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Thats about. I even think, the 'set it to BE' statement counts at first after 2-3 days. If you want to follow it so long. An about 100 pips SL is a must. Weird to switch from scalping to D1. Back and forth.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
67.23

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I did that for a while but it drove me nuts. I now only trade on H1 with the occasional small lots size (0.2 lots instead of my normal 1 lot) daily chart trades. I think even if I didn't have a job and therefore more time to scalp, I still wouldn't trade lower timeframes than H1. Feels too much like a fulltime job On the H1 NZDJPY still moves sideways it seems...will wiat until it moves a bit lower before entering.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I would like to have that not to be considered as boasting, but i have to post that. ALL trades are made using THV in D1 So so nice to look at it.. If i close all trades now, it would be 320 pips. But i will manage them one by one. Lets see how much i will squeeze out and was it better to close all now or one by one.. I know i have 5 YPN trades, that was risky, but worked. This time..

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Good job

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Lesson from today. 340 was the absolute Peak for the day. After watching 1/2 of the gain vanishing, preparing for tomorrow, switching charts back and forth, shifting SL and TP what will happen tomorrow, should i.., MA5 blah blah..i had enough, closed all trades and happy with 150 pips. And i also made a decision for my further D1 trading. Instead loosing nerves and life time managing the D1 trades over days, simply 40-60 pips + and out. And finito. No set to BE, no sell the half. etc. Managing 5-9 open trades is stressful and more unpredictable than scalping. One of the reasons why im switching from scalping to higher TFs, was to have less stress Who cares if it will go another 200 pips if i have my 50 pips in my pocket. Instead to increase the open trades time better increase the Lot size and keep the open time short. Still a nice day.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
We need to trade on TF which give less Stress. Definitely higher TF give less Stress and give more time to plan for next trade for tomorrow. Good Job please keep posted .

--- 帖子 #545 ---
How about trailing price at a % of profits in cave manager? I'm playing around with a trailing stop that's 30% behind current price and seems to work ok'ish so far. Still toying around with it though, so many settings. My demo account (obviously testing on demo only at this stage) looks hilarious since I started playing with Cave Manager. Will take me at least another 2 weeks to come up with decent settings.

Nice move on EURAUD this morning, but I missed it...the rest is pretty disappointing to be honest given there was quite a bit of news so far.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I lost 40% from my capital so far, win and lose but net profit is -40% and am using THV. I don't know where is the problem tbh. I follow the calender ,news feed and technical but still losing may be am doing something wrong. Am Trading EURUSD 95% btw since I tried THV on demo tested on that pair and I have 8 monthes xp on that pair. But this is my result.

Crazy busy at work...gonna apply the same strategy to the H4 charts for the rest of the week. I'm too busy to check charts every 30min-1hr, and I get annoyed at missing too many nice setups. H4 charts will allow me to stay in trades for longer. Using cave manager as follows: 1) Initial stop loss of 15pips (might increase it to 20pips...still testing) 2) Once I get 15pips into profit my SL is set to BE. Yes, it's tight...but I rather get kicked out at BE a few times and re-enter than having large drawdowns. 3) Once I hit +60pips my stop loss will stumble behind current price at 30% of profit. 4) If slow Trix changes color and I'm happy with the gain I'm allowed to exit manually. The only really interesting times are when price is pretty close to the Coral, so it won't take long to go through charts. Lowering lots/trade to 0.5 until I'm comfortable.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
He he, started the same yesterday. H4 Made a new test account and now trying to find the right values for me. D1 is to slow to be traded only, so why not have a look at H4 also. The only thing i dont like about H4 is, different brokers have different H4 candles, but trying to ignore that

--- 帖子 #553 ---
btw. Thats exactly what im trying to persuade me at the moment. Dont like BE because i usually dont re enter trades. If im out i move on.. Usually.. And in 3/4 of the cases you first have to see a minus to see a plus at the end, so with be you get kicked out very often.

--- 帖子 #554 ---

Was impatient and did not wanted to wait because i was sure ..

--- 帖子 #563 ---
And then ended like this..

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Importand to be noticed at this point. (Again) If you trade this way.. Wait till MA5 is really broken and the next Candle confirms it, closes and stays below. Here, it wasnt the case. I broke the rule and did not waited.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hahaha, yeah...you can imagine how often I kick myself for breaking the rules At this point it's all about consistency. I really trust the system overall, it's just that I still suffer a bit from overtrading or not waiting until "everything lines up". My super narrow 15pip initial stop loss and setting the SL to BE after 15pips really helped me to cut down on such losses though. Since you gave a tip above I'll do the same: - Pay close attention to support/resistance levels (I use fractals because they rock and very rarely Fibonacci if I can be assed) and ROUND figures. If you plan on going long, and price is already at 1.295, wait until that psychological level CLEARLY breaks. Often moves are limited by round figures, and they're often great spots to take profit if you don't manage your trades manually. You can always hop back into a trade if the move continues strongly. The 0.0050 levels are minor levels that often play a roll as well. Price often stalls there for a bit... - Pay close attention to CORRELATION. The strongest moves often show correlated pairs to strongly all move in the same direction, while negatively correlated pairs do the opposite. Do NOT trade if strongly correlated pairs don't follow the same trend. I trade the following pairs...and correlations are highlighted: - Positively correlated to eachother: EURUSD, EURJPY, EURAUD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD - Negatively correlated to the above: USDCHF, USDCAD These correlations are quite strong on the H1 charts...on shorter time frames it might be different. The above really helped me increase my "hit rate". Of course the usual "don't break the bloody rules" thing still applies. It helps not to be a donkey Up 91 pips this week...crazy busy at work, so sadly missed most perfect entries. EDIT: Found a new avatar. May it remind me not to be an idiot. Thanks

Unless US retail sales and the other US data being released this afternoon is somehow surprisingly good, I don't see GBPUSD dropping (much) further. The Coral on the H1 charts seems to be holding nicely, at least for now. Given the news releases I will hold off until a clearer trend or break emerges.

What a snooze-fest today

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Dont worry,I know what i am doing. I ended up gbp trading with decent profit. Bwt, who cares about the U.S. economic data,their only real news is the revelation of the blame for the global crisis and the collapse of manipulative system.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
The only reason I care about news at all is because it tells me when moves will likely take place. I really don't care why the market moves, for all I care traders could move the market based on how many cows are on a field It's purely a timing tool...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Had a look at USD/JPY H4, Swiched to H1 to have closer a look, is there something that could block it.. as it started blinking and falling. Went to M1 and found this right in the development.. mh, i miss Scalping

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Thats a joke or ?? Thats what i call perfect SL setting !?! Rule 876: Never go into a trade at Friday, if elections are at the weekend. Also dont set such a gayish SL.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Even at M5 its looking weird..

--- 帖子 #576 ---
And that's why I don't trade over weekends

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Classic..

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Yup...nice moves today...took a while to get moving though. Easy 70pips though, so I won't complain

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I can not complain too.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
wrong topic...

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I promise i will never ever use SL to Be. I knew it will go like this, but noo, being only 30 pips in plus have to secure the trade with sl to be. Of course.. 2 times triggered and then missed to go short again... (trade also made with THV H4)

08:22 AM here. Just came home. The visit felt as sleep at the moment we arrived, he he, me, have to check the €/$ first. Cant sleep before.. Happy new year. What a cool night. Wish you all health and pips in 2013. And love. Lets do it. Lets became rich this year and then trade only for fun. Ok ? I feel it.. 2013 will be the year . (Maybe)

--- 帖子 #584 ---
EUR / NZD H4 I would say yes,

--- 帖子 #585 ---
EUR / NZD D1 But also.. Here a D1 short that could bring 100 pips or so. Usually i would join the gamble, but new year and new trading resolution. Better a missed trade than a Fail trade. Thats the easy key to success with THV. Keep your loss trades small, the 70-80 % Thv accuracy does the rest. Will not enter both at this point. Later it will be too late, its a watch and learn trade. Tomorrow we know more.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I really dont like correlation. EUR/GBP D1 At this chart pic i would say long, but i also said short at EUR/NZD D1 Also notice 0.8100

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Absolute D1 correlation.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
If you trade multiple Pairs in H4 or D1, you have to have a very close look about it. Eur/Gbp Eur/Nzd was a easy example. But there are crosses or complete different Pairs that you never though about. Entering correlated pairs, drives up only the risk of fail. Plus, the correlation changes from time to time. If a Pair had 80 % correlation last 6 months it can easy change to correlation 20 % next month and continue this way. MyFXBook is a realy cool site. They just added the section. http://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market.../EURGBP-EURNZD

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Thats very interesting. Especially at the present chart patterns if you compare it..

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hehehe, happy new year to you too Just got back from 2 awesome week of snowboarding in the Swiss Alpes. Today had its up and downs and it was my first day of trading in 2013. So far so good, up a bit over 110 pips going long EURUSD and short USDCHF. On the downside, I had to pull 2 wisdom teeth today and I look like a hamster...tried to chat up the cute receptionist at my dentist, but my tongue wouldn't oblige. Anyway: Went long EURUSD because the majority of the candle body broke through the Coral, and the Trix broke through the 0.00000 line. It also had enough room towards the 1.3100 level and price didn't seem to manage a breakthrough below 1.30000. The opposite is true for USDCHF, no surprise there. Quite a few alternative trade opportunities today, but I was so drugged up with painkillers I was happy with my 2 trades

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Slow day it seems...bit of retracement for EURUSD and USDCHF...but I doubt it's going to surpass the Corals by a ton...too late to enter for my liking.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I'm short EURUSD because it seems like the EUR is getting under a bit of pressure on the H1 charts. Price is below the coral, below the moving average, both Trix are red, it broke through the H1 support level, and Damiani tells me to trade...we'll see where it goes. On a side note, as of today I'm managing some of my dad's funds...which funny enough puts a bit of additional psychological pressure on me. At the same time it will probably prevent me from spazzing out too much because I don't want him to kill me The thing I need to get used to is the lot size I now trade...it's slightly scary and a 10pip move is now suddenly "a lot" of money because my overall balance is a lot larger. Will take a bit to get used to. I need to think in % terms, not $ amounts to overcome this... EDIT: Got stopped out...oh well.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Congrats for the promotion. I opened a Alpari Account last week, where i will trade only H4. Scalping will remain at Dukascopy. Yesterday.. Sad i took only 0.05 Lot, but wanted to start comfortable. My first trade..

Today.. I have to admit, little bit of luck was also there, but worked

--- 帖子 #595 ---
USD/JPY H4

Luck ...or some bears around ...doesn't really matter, the important thing is that u had a setup according to your rules, and u have take it.

THV H4 Friday close.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
If you follow the $/Y drama.. I would say, 89.35 is to watch. BOJ at Tuesday.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
And the winner is... One BOJ later, despite all the 'analysts' and hypes and wishful thinking that i read over the weekend.. THV

--- 帖子 #601 ---
USDCAD ftw...super predictable too since it wasn't likely their national bank would revise the interest rate On a side note: From now on I will check the M1, M5 and M15 charts whenever things line up in H1...should net me more pips next time.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
4 days later H4.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
EUR/GBP D1 Not realy clear at the moment, but worth to stalk it..

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I think most EUR and US pairs will be calm today in anticipation of tomorrow's news releases. Pairs I'm interested in today include USDCAD (really close to parity) and GBPUSD (will the H4 coral serve as new support...or will the down trend continue?). I think we're already too far up for EURGBP to risk going long, I wouldn't buy in before the next dip.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Did not wanted to post predictions. Im more for a nice short at this point, he he but till now not a 100 % Signal. Have to wait.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Yeah, a bit of a reversal is overdue. Having said that, I think the EUR will outperform the Pound in the medium term, so my main strategy for that pair is to buy into dips as long as the medium term outlook stays the same. Living in the UK I can tell you things aren't looking all that bright. Having said that, no harm in taking advantage of a couple of short term reversals...even if they are likely short-lived. Also, can that damn 1.0000 USDCAD level finally break please? Still waiting for my first trade today...

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Its true. I oversaw it. WPV 1.5811 and there we are. Its about H4 50:50 chance bias short imo.. On the other side D1 looks slightly bullish so.. hmmm. No clue, we will see..

--- 帖子 #608 ---
The one thing to note is that the EUR seems to cope better with bad news than the USD at the moment...which makes me think the long bias is still valid (especially given the bad US GDP). Overall markets seem pretty asleep today. Everyone's waiting for tomorrow's news release I guess. I recon EURUSD will continue its sleepy downwards correction (as a breather) before attempting to push towards 1.3670ish (and maybe beyond).

--- 帖子 #609 ---
A valuable thread here Toranaga et al. Sad to see that Misspips no longer feels she can post. Hopefully she is still lurking around collecting pips for herself on the quiet. I am only really trading M1 and M5 on EurUsd,GBPJPY,EURJPY and USDJPY with THV. I generally do not trade and post at the same time so this morning I am reading and posting but for what it's worth here's my analysis this morning. I did not trade this as not feeling great today and may need to go and crash out so staying on the sidelines and reading and posting for a change but thought I would share the sort of way I am currently using THV after about 6 months of trial and error to find what works for me. I have both live and demo accounts running. Given the strength of the uptrend I am biased towards a retest of the highs and may trade that in the US session later today - we shall see what the charts tell us. Out of interest how have you found THV for your H4 and D1 trades?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Having said that I did get in on EURUSD at 136.25 a late and rather poor entry for me which fortunately is running away with me.... edit: Given the M5 trix is below the zero line I took profit on all 4 pairs once I had exceeded my daily target and will probably stay away now until 12 noon GMT

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Pretty sweet night AUD PPI came in worse than expected...right followed by bad Chinese data which further hammered the AUD. I went short AUDUSD and long EURAUD for a nice chunk of pips.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Rollercoaster day...glad I disabled my automatic stop loss and monitored stuff manually. Bought EURUSD at 1.3660 just to see it crash by 60pips...but I stayed in thinking that unless the Coral on the H1 chart is broken the uptrend will likely continue. I also bought another 0.5 lots at 1.3605 once the down spike seemed over. Overall a pretty sweet 135pip day...but my nerves are still buzzing. That 60pip drop freaked me out as hell before I realized that it's probably just going to retest the 1.3600 level. Wouldn't be surprised to see another correction before the EUR heads further north. Happy weekend ppl

--- 帖子 #613 ---
hmmm. Aud/Nzd at the moment.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
What could also led to a nice M5 short, but not with this ridiculous 5.9 pips Alpari spread. Thats the Micro account for long term trades. I scalp over Dukascopy..

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I guess the big EURUSD retracement (or even trend change?) caught some people by surprise If it breaks through 1.3480 it's likely to hit the 1.3400...on the upside, if we bounce back above 1.3550 and stay there it's likely to retest 1.3700 after battling with 1.3600 again. Right not I expect EURUSD to trade a bit lower before rebounding. AUD news to hit in 30min and then again 3hrs later!! How you been Toranaga? I changed my approach a bit lately. I first check the D1 and H4 trends...and then enter based on H1 IF my trade is in the same direction as the long term trend. If not I'll use the H1 chart and then drop down to M15 for perfect entries. Sadly my RL job prevents me from trying option 2 all that much, but at least I'm more often in line with the overall trend

--- 帖子 #616 ---
EMA 220 Shift 2. Had a party when i discovered the power of.. Ema220

--- 帖子 #617 ---
But you are right. I was focused on Eur/Gbp Stalked it the whole last week. Lost the €/$ view. Was to early with my short and lost a lot of money. Or did i only took the SL to tight.. hm Now its seems its time for a great D1 short, what also suggest a 50-150 pips €/$ short We will see.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
€/$ D1 Great short possibility if i (try) to wait another 1-2 days for the confirmation. Entry below 1.3460 or so...

--- 帖子 #619 ---
H1 try..

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Tip: 1) Go to the H1 chart and draw a horizontal line at the very tip of the Coral...mine is yellow. 2) Do the same on the H4 chart...mine is orange. 3) Do the same on the D1 chart...mine is red. Yellow &gt; Orange &gt; Red = up trend Red &gt; Orange &gt; Yellow = down trend To confirm a reversal, the yellow line has to cross the orange line...and if everything else lines up your target should be when the yellow line hits the red one. You can "abuse" your orange line as a broad stop loss too if you want. If the orange and yellow lines are really close together you should play close attention to PA Might work on lower TF as well, but I haven't tested it. Seems to be a very simple (but effective) way of figuring out trend directions and confirming reversals. Of course you could do it for all timeframes (above M15) and draw a pretty rainbow...but lately I'm focusing a bit more on the longer TF. Very tempted to have a programmer draw those lines automatically for me. Hope you lot captured the blitz move up in EURUSD this afternoon PS: Thx for the EMA 220 tip...I'll give it a try Sample below (oh look, seems like there's a chance the yellow line might break out to the downside):

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Thanksss ! btw. i read carefully and often more than one time all your posts (and from the others) but i cant answer all immediately, or sometimes there isnt nothing to answer only to notice it or when i have the time and muse to answer the moment is gone. Wanted to point that out Being on forums helps a lot but also cost a lot of time...

--- 帖子 #622 ---
No worries at all, didn't expect an answer to be honest...just figured it's something that might help people. That system already helped me today as it made it clear that staying out of trades was the right thing to do today...because the market consolidated ahead of tomorrow's "Draghi hopium session"

Greed. I should wait.. But i wont.. Aud/Nzd M1

--- 帖子 #624 ---

--- 帖子 #625 ---
The only prob. is. My scalp tool was locked at €/$ forgot that.. So instead to short Aud/Nzd and make 25 pips in 5 minutes i shorted €/$ and closed it at the moment with minus 4.7 Well, thats cool..

--- 帖子 #626 ---
If someone has Draghi's email address, please send it to me...that man is the goose that keeps on laying golden eggs for us Forex traders and I owe him a thank you Best single trading day since I went live...sadly not on my own account, dad asked me to trade his account as he was busy. 148pips in EURUSD, 74pips USDCHF, 162pips EURJPY and a couple of pips in EURAUD (entered that one too late as I was watching the rest instead of looking for other opportunities). I was initially long, but when the rate decision didn't allow price to knock out a previous high (in fact, it just went sideways during the hours leading up to it), warning flags went up and I exited all trades. Hopped in once price crossed my "yellow line", the H1 Coral, and enjoyed the ride down. Still getting used to trading larger lot sizes, but on days like these it's definitely not that bad Now I just need to make sure I don't pull off a donkey move and piss it all away again. I probably won't trade tomorrow in order to calm down a bit from the rush. I think my boss thought I won the lottery because I kept on grinning all day long. EURJPY is an amazing pair by the way...notice how the Corals (H1 = yellow, H4 = orange) served as a pretty perfect entry/exit level.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Will write later, cant stop to laugh now.. yep, what a day, and i was Short since yesterday at 1.3520.. (Heikin Ashi said i should do so.. and i done it..) btw. H1 at the moment..

Great post. Same here. Btw. Now your Dad thinks you are a God like trader and from now you can only disappoint him, ha ha. Joke he he Pressure.. Thats the point. same if you loose big and then it turns just after you went out. See my €/Gbp drama ; Calm down. There is always a tomorrow.. I was short from yesterday evening at 1.3520. Did you saw the pretty and cool Heikin Ashi in D1 . I did not needed more plus the 'Trix confirmed it. Also break of MA5. What a cool day. And still going. At the moment. After fighting for fours about 1.3400 drop to 1.3387 in minutes.. I Forex.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hehehe, yeah, the pressure's on I'm afraid. He wants to deposit more so I can increase my lot size, but I don't really want to. Still getting used to larger amounts and I need a bit longer to ease in. No major losses though so far. I think the largest single loss was 27pips or so...and it only happened because I entered a trade and then got pulled away by my boss before I switched on the automatic stop loss. Like your Youtube idea...I could use that to teach my dad. I saw the HA candle but was a bit too chicken...ECB news days can throw curveballs at you sometimes. By the way, kinda funny how Goldman acted a if 1.4200 was right around the corner...I guess they had to unwind some EURUSD positions ahead of Draghi's speech. GL tomorrow...we should see some CAD movements.

EURJPY is my favorite pair at the moment. Decent swings throughout the day. Didn't have a ton of time today and entered a bit late...but still grabbed a nice 36pips Entry: 124.58 Exit: 124.22 Automatic stop loss EA kicked me out while I was in a meeting...

--- 帖子 #636 ---
€/$ H4 ..

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Quick mid day update... EURUSD: Trix are still below the 0.00000 line (indicating a short bias) and it looks like they might bounce off. Pretty clear the current level offers quite a bit of support and I would like price to break through before going short...just to have some confirmation. Momentum is really shitty though at the moment, so I'm staying on the sidelines until price wakes up. EURJPY: We're in a pretty clear downtrend on the M15 charts. Price is creating lower lows and if it bounces off the Coral (fat red line) it will probably retest 123.00 or go lower. I'll wait if the slow Trix crosses the 0.00000 line upwards or not before hopping in. Right now I kinda expect it to bounce off...indicating a further move down to at least 123.00. I'm biased towards the downside, but who knows whether or not Draghi and the G-20 clowns pull a rabbit out of their hat...will wait until I have confirmation either way, not playing the "guess the bottom/top" game. PA's beyond awful at the moment...

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hahaha, turns out they went in the exact opposite direction...lost 15pips when I shorted it at the beginning. Got in a bit late once it turned around but still managed to grab 61pips for a net profit of 46pips today Draghi throwing curve balls...

--- 帖子 #639 ---
does the thv tris repaint? and if so how much candles ? thx! edit : ok it does not

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Glad I was not the only one suckered by this. I too managed to grab pips on the return to end up but very disappointed in my trade entry and exit. Needs work... -Er- the trix does repaint the last bars worth. This takes some getting used to. The way to manage this is use trix in combination with the other thv indicators PLUS another signal. For me this is a mix of other timeframes plus fractals and moving averages and act when everything lines up.

I missed everything today due to work EURUSD was such a perfect trade...in both directions...so unbelievably perfect!

--- 帖子 #645 ---
yep, thats the point. It was simply a perfect trade. After noticing at about 2 PM today how the € got pumped up to 1.3320 in a row i got suspicious and remembered my own Rule. "Never eat what they serve.." I 'knew' they pumped it up and will drop it. Equal who wins, btw. i did not believed Berlusconi will win, never ever. Now as we see, it was equal who will win. It was a simple money making trap. Glad i was on the right side. Could not await 3 PM and Pol closing. And i was right. Had SkyNews, German TV and a Italian News station running Took more than a Lot so it was a little nerve wracking, (Afterwards. I did a News play with more than a Lot. Best way to ruin your account fast. More than fast. Fast fast..) But sometimes its worth the risk.. Im realy proud about this trade. Afterwards, i should stay longer IN, but apart from that, i did everything right and never had a doubt about what im doing. I feel superior the whole day

Just doodling on my charts before tomorrows session and thought this was such a great Fib retracement with support at each successive level both up and down I thought I would share it. Also a slightly tenuous head and shoulders suggesting a potential target should the 61.8 fib be breached.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Started using Fibs a bit more too, but still mostly focusing on fractals as they do a pretty good job at showing price action...and I finally cleaned up my charts a bit. JPY trades now mostly taken on M5, the rest on M15.

USD/JPY H4 96.16 A nice short in the developing. Maybe. Worth to watch it. Patience.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Broke the MA5 way too late so the original Signal was no more valid imo..

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Sooooo, I spent a ton of time improving my stop loss management over the past couple of days. I now use the H4 as my medium/long term bias and most of the time only trade in the same direction...unless price dropped by a ton and I figure a retracement could result in a good amount of pips. I time entries on the M5 for EURJPY and M15 for the rest. My initial stop loss is the Kijun Sen until the Kijun Sen hits my entry price...at which point I'm switching over to using the Tenkan Sen as a stop loss. If the move continues and price moves above the H1 Kijun Sen I'll use that as stop loss. If price continues to move in the same direction as the main H4 trend, I will switch over to the H1 Kijun and then Tenkan Sen for a while before finally doing the same on the H4 chart. This allows me to "phase into" trades and get into trades early while still being able to capture the majority of larger moves. Bought an EA that does most of it automatically, just need to switch templates every time I move up a timeframe and it automatically adjusts the stop loss. Using the EA from "landofcash.net". Nice chap too, already asked if I have any suggestions for improvements...made back the $80 I spent in less than a day.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Yup, still very beneficial. If on the H4 Damiani tells me not to trade, I know all I can do is trade on lower timeframes. Same goes for H1...if Damiani says "do not trade" I'll drop down to M15, and maybe even M5 if I'm up for scalping.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
+50pips, happy days. Could have entered earlier but wanted to see yesterday's low broken as confirmation of the down move.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Great trade. Congrats. Me, ashamed. I managed it to loose. Got stopped out. Dont ask why i went long..

--- 帖子 #660 ---
As a general hint: If the H4 fast Trix is red...don't go long. Since I'm sticking to that I cut down on losers quite a bit EDIT: meant "long" of course...shouldn't be posting while looking at charts at the same time...

--- 帖子 #661 ---

News from the division "Its always easy afterwards.." Trix Cross on Zero , break of MA5, break of Coral, break of WPV , all lined up.. Next stop WS1. Dumb if you went long few hours before that i did not want to see the truth

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I wouldn't worry to be honest, you're doing the right thing by reviewing losers...assuming you learn from it. I always do that after every single trade. I always ask myself if my entries/exits could have been timed better, even when the trade ends up being a winner. It's the best way to learn imo

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hmm.. Trying something new. AUD/USD H4 Last H4. In the last 3 hours.. Price went down touched MPV 1.0284 and went up again. At the moment more than a hour more to wait for the next H4 candle.. Have a look at the Trix. It seems like a cross will happen, but thats not the point.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
And now the same Chart as a M5 view.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
On the M5 charts I tend to want both Trix below the 0.00000 line before entering. That's when you have confirmation that the move will be sustained for a bit...otherwise you're playing a bit of a guessing game imo.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Good point. Did not tried to show a signal at the moment, trying to find a pattern rule or a money trap. Interesting constellation i find. Edit: But at the other side TF M5 a break of MA5 could show a possible short with SL tight above EMA220 or at WR1 and TP tight below Coral or at MPV, depending on risk

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Check out the Kijun Sen and Tenkan Sen as stop losses...they're amazing. Since I've started using that EA my trading is super stress free. You can phase into trades nicely by taking the initial trade on the M15 and then scale it up if you believe the move will continue...so at first it bases the stop loss on the Kijun/Tenkan Sen of the M15, then the H1...and finally the H4. Great way to have low-risk entries with tight initial stop losses. You could do the same with M1-M15 of course.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Good example of why I want both of them below that line...got burned too many times

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Thanks. Have to have a closer look at it. Till now i dont pay attention to it. What it your setup for the Ichi. Is it different for M5 or H4 ??

Standard settings 'cause they work just fine. Under some circumstances slightly different settings sometimes work slightly better, but overall it's not worth changing them. Tested it on 6 pairs.

Bought this a while ago, works great: LINK You can set the Kijun Sen as a stop loss and even add a buffer if you want so you won't get kicked out just because price crosses it by 2pips. If you want the Tenkan Sen just use the Tenkan Sen figure (26) instead of the Kijun Sen (9) one. Tons of other options too, but some are already available in the Cave Manager EA which of course is free. Just liked the way this one handles the Kijun Sen stop loss.

Yeah, but not a lot of time to react...you had like 30sec tops to react for NZDUSD.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Could NOT resist

--- 帖子 #678 ---
And just closed the trade. +3 pips plus the spread was 7.9 pips as i closed the trade. Overall, nice thrill at the end of the day, but now its enough Maybe a second entry after breaking EMA 20 (orange) but only maybe..

--- 帖子 #679 ---
It seems it was a perfect Exit. Now thinking about a re entry...... Short of course..

--- 帖子 #680 ---
@4exninja Saw you "GBP exploded" switched to it.. M5.. I know what we talked yesterday about M5 Signals and below 0.00000 but that was different. More like the €/$ patern from yesterday we talked about..

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Yeah...was Oanda messing with me...showed a 50pip+ gain for a couple of minutes...back to normal though.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Whats about a completely newbie question Which time do you use to calculate you daily Pivots ? It isnt easy as it seems.. NY close (why?) London open (also why?) Rollover time or Japan open or.. At the moment with Alpari (GMT +2 Server Time) and me Germany (GMT +1) so HrsServerTzFromGMT 2 HrsChoiceTzFromGMT 1 What makes my Daily Pivots being recalculated at 01 AM Alpari MT4 Server time what is 00 in my GMT +1 time.. Someone a better solution or how do you deal with it..

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Where are the actual Indicators themselves for this trading system?

--- 帖子 #684 ---
I use the Kumo cloud's flat tops/bottoms as s/r levels...no pivots needed. Start at the W1 chart and highlight the top 1-2 key levels, then move to the D!, and so on until you hit the H1. Easy

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Well, one Answer to my question. I see, im not alone. Btw. my thread, so no one can ban me here temporally Read the €/$ thread last hour. He he, no one has a clue at the moment, and now hidden fighting starts and giving useless hints to newbies with silly posts.. Wonder what, on trending days a lot of 'experts' appear but at days like these there are rare good posts and a lot of no cluation and guessing Funny, but im wasting time there today..

--- 帖子 #686 ---
The way to handle the EURUSD thread is to simply put everyone on ignore who's opinion you don't value. Stick to atilla, Math, Max Doom, Ken and a few of the other guys who give genuine advice. A lot of those guys are quite nice once you start chatting, and if you PM them they will give you tips. I tend to put everyone who posts stuff like "had a 14% drawdown today" on my ignore list immediately

--- 帖子 #687 ---
4ex Is there a way to filter out those making useless posts - an ignore list facility?? That would be good.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
AUD/NZD D1 Waited since the last green HA for the right entry. (1.2610) Now it seems i missed the 1st class entry.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
You can click on their profile and select "put on ignore list", that will do the trick People you should definitely keep off that list are: attila math GB Ken Max Doom Bocephus gatorinla PS: I missed every single entry for today...£$%£"£$£!!!

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Collected 20 pips in $/Y during the night but also cant be happy after i saw that he went another 50 pips down. With proper TS and BE that would not happen. Yes i know Cave Manager.. yes i know.. But im used to trade with hard TP. Better i start to change that.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Like I said, give Ichimoku a chance in respect to TP and stop losses...it works PERFECTLY. You would have captured pretty much the entire move. Sadly I missed the entry, so it was a non event for me. That money manager I linked a while back works like a charm. Yes, it isn't free, but it's quite flexible and does everything you could possibly want. You can even set TP levels in batches if you want. I keep it simple though and simply pick the Tenkan or Kijun Sen depending on how volatile markets are, and depending on what timeframe I trade of.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
NZD/USD H1 Later more. Have to leave the desk now. Also waiting for WR1 to be broken and for a better entry in lover TFs.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Gracias - I must start using technology better.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
That was exactly what i thought. Bounced perfect at WR1. M30 gives a better picture what happened. WRes plus EMA20, NO easy SHORT at this point.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
As a 'former' scalper, i feel the pain. I made 6 trades this week. (All green btw. Last week, also all green. Me, also surprised.. Thats NOT usual, but i perfecting my System. The most important part is, Patience. Wait sucker.. Not coulda shoulda woulda, wait, simply wait.... Till Signal.. As i started i made 30-50 trades per day. Later grow up, reduced it to 10 per Day scalping M1-M5 and at the moment H1-H4-D1 at most 10 trades per WEEK. But thats the way i see. You have to have the patience. Watching the charts ONE week and making 5 trades is nothing and it sucks and encumber your Nerves. But.. It pays. b

--- 帖子 #696 ---
As posted.. Afterwards. Made 8.9 pips with 6.2 pips spread, #whats a audacity..

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Love it when everything lines up perfectly...nothing beats easy trades

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Have to record this for my own. Im pissed of.. Followed the $/Y since Japan opened, and i knew IT WILL HAPPEN. Found a perfect entry and got into short with one Lot perfectly timed. At 94.89

--- 帖子 #699 ---
But what happened. On the way down, dinggggg, MT4 disconnection at 94.789 lasted 10 seconds and with plus about 30 sec, the mt4 needs to load all the charts indis aso we was one candle further and on the way up. Pivot bouncing happened while i was disconnected. Well, great.. Disturbed in the flow seeing we bounced at pivot, 4 PIPS back again !! i closed the trade at 94.80

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Needless to say that the price continued down to 94.69 what was also my preferred exit (before the disconnection) and disturbing my trade.. Of course you could say, shame on you, who with two brain cells scalps with a Lot or more over MT4 yes i know yes i know, butttttt... It was my first trade, its late here and i was lazy to start Dukascopy... And i have a contract, it HAS TO WORK. Even the small printed says something different. If someone from Alpari reads this, well thanks for the stable connection.. The right before Pivot thing, must be a coincidence, i will not start.. Edit: As im writing, disconnection again. Few sec but ...

--- 帖子 #701 ---
btw. Oldy but.. I think i would ask Watson regarding EA.. Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Toranaga I struggled for a lot over the years with unreliable connections. I decided MT4 is a sensitive and quite a hungry beast. Brokers seem to put their proprietary platforms first and will look to make sure that is stable before worrying about third party interfaces like MT4 that they cannot do anthing about. In the end I have decided that the only way to manage this is use MT4 for entry signals, and for management of trades ongoing, but always to have the brokers proprietary trading platform open in the background, even with a few simple moving averages on just as a backup to manage trades for those times when MT4 strats to wobble - which it laways does when the market moves quickly. I think the complexity of the charts we use for THV (especially if you use mini charts like those from pipware or Misspips indies) means there will always be a risk of performance issues or even the dreaded crash/disconnect. My final backup is the phone to close out everything if I think technology is having a bad day. I take the view if my trades are so sensitive they require split second or even in minute action to be profitable then I am probably trading badly/at too high a risk. The dilema for me is using stops as another protection against loss of service - I hate the idea of telling brokers in advance where they can get my trade. Just my ha'penny worth :-) Sound like you need some sleep to me!

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Good advice by Revoli...I have Oanda 's mobile platform installed too on my phone/tablet just in case MT4 ever breaks down (which has happened in the past).

Short EU Entry after 1m Cloud was crossed from above, after: 1. PA retested S1 2. 1m and 5m Trix all red and crossed 3. MTF trix showed Trix 15m fast and slow, 30m fast and slow red 4. MTF cloud 15 and 30m red 5. 5m bearisch Divergence exit (when screen was taken) after recognizing bounce from S2 and yL out with +13 Pips (iam still in learning phase, getting used to THV in combination with my trading style, have been reading the original thread until post 9900 and still reading) appreciate some critics and advices)

--- 帖子 #705 ---
ExejeSen, you are a Mac user! I am too! Wish you a good luck.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
What I love about THV is it really spells out what you should do...... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not sure why I was placing orders then? Even less sure why I managed a good day. Lack of discipline.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Not just that, it also works great with other systems...especially Ichimoku which I'm really starting to love. THV + Kumo cloud + Tenkan Sen + Kijun Sen = perfection! It even gives you take profit levels

--- 帖子 #708 ---
New setup...just to show how THV works well with other systems

Some EURUSD thoughts...just so no one says I'm only posting in the EURUSD thread

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Did not said that but thought about.. Joke.. Edit: The problem withe the €/$ Threa d is that a lot of great posts 'disappear' with in minutes in busy times.. You have to scroll back and filter out too too much, no time and muse for that. Thats the reason why i visit is only occasionally..

--- 帖子 #711 ---
$/Y D1 Interesting constellation. 'We' waited long for that.. (Also se W1)

--- 帖子 #712 ---
As a example.. That could be a great discussion, but tomorrow when you read that, (if maybe..) it will be somewhere buried.. within 200 post till then.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I actually think you're right...and I can prove it. Most trading nowadays is done by algorithms and HFT. Most of those programs trade solely based on charts, and not fundamental news...ergo, price largely moves due to price action on charts. As for the EURUSD thread, yup, can get confusing. The way to do it is to hide all posts from people you consider "bad". I mostly use it to get opinions about price levels, and I have to admit, I learned a ton from the chaps in the thread.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Nothing like waking up to a 500pip gain. Glad I entered buy/sell stops before going to bed, and I'm really happy with my analysis at the moment Taking the rest of the day off...

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Good job, Ninja! Congretulations.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Thanks Also, using the Tenkan or Kijun Sen as trailing stops is the absolute nuts! The only time I override it is if price overshoots massively and reaches crucial price levels...at which point I'll sometimes exit manually. Bit annoyed I had the "take profit at 100pips" option ticked 'cause I would have almost doubled my profit otherwise, but oh well, can't be too greedy

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Forgot to mention: THV is a great system, but you can really boost your income if you add some decent price level analysis. Personally I prefer Ichimoku, Centre of Gravity, dynamic Fibo and especially Murrey Math levels to figure those out. Plenty of indicators let you automate this, so it only takes 5-10min/pair to note down those levels...and they don't change every day. The way I currently do it, is to establish a pivot zone (sell below, buy above, sit on hands inside the zone) every night before going to bed. Don't pick a hard level (eg: 1.5125), use a ZONE...that will keep you out of a lot of difficult areas and trades. Once you have that, simply wait until THV lines up in connection with that price level analysis and aim for the price levels you established. Tenkan and Kijun Sen are great as "emergency stop losses" and often exit at pretty good levels on their own.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Nice going 4exninja. I too had laoded up on GJ late yesterday and did not set a TP so was pleasantly surprised to see my account doubled. Unfortunately this was only my demo account and I had to work quite hard to grab a decent number of pips for my live account in the small part of the day I traded. I am but a simple soul and will take any good THV signal that conicides with a support or resistance level, or a fractal breakout. There were plenty of those around today. I also took a flyer on the EurUsd going long at the bottom following a prompt from Sonic on his thread. Naughty as not my signal and should not have taken it. Would be interested in the price level analysis stuff. Any suggested reading? I need something to stop me trading any more, this party is going to last longer than me and concentration wanes.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Aside from THV, my first PA analysis focuses on Ichimoku, and the best site to learn about it is this one: LINK I then use the following indicators to figure out other levels: - Channel: SHI_channel_true - Center of Gravity: Center of Gravity 1 - Fibo: JJN-Fibo - Murrey Math: MurreyMath_History To learn more about these, just google "Murrey Math", Fibonacci, Center of Gravity and "Price channels". I use daily and sometimes H4 charts to figure out those base levels and never use them on anything below H1. I only use shorter timeframes to time entries and then use THV and Ichimoku as my entry signals. By the way, nice result you got there Just be careful, because if you can increase your account by so much in a single day it's likely you're overleveraged. Depends on the size of your stop loss though. Based on a % basis I seem overleveraged too at first glance, but my average winner is 6.6x larger than my average loser, so it never really bothered me...I'm mostly after breakouts. I use Ichimoku's Tenkan or Kijun Sen as initial and trailing stops which works fine. It's just a matter of entering early enough. Alternatively you can try re-entering at a lower timeframe if you missed the boat, only if everything lines up though.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Thx 4ex, will read with interest. It's always good to read these things, knowledge is always useful. Application is the key. My live account only clocked 80 pips (only tee hee) the demo account is for non rule positions and hunches I would not dare trade live and yes leveraged higher than my 2% risk norm. Fun only.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Whats about €/$ M5

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Just waiting for another pullback before hopping into a short again...at least that's the plan for now.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Did not made a single trade in €/$ this week but playing $/Y back and forth since Monday, till the majority there (see $/Y thread) waits for the magic 100 or 1000 to come. Last trade (short) for this week is at the moment 40 pips plus i set it to BE and will ride it to the end even if it hits my BE (+6 pips) btw. erased my loss from Friday (shorted $/Y ???) and made some gains so, im happy..

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I think I only took 2 EUR trades this week...cheated on EUR with oil and the SPX500 In case you're wondering...yes...THV works just fine with those too...but you don't get a Trix for SPX500, but adding Ichimoku and Murrey Math solves that issue.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Looks like EURUSD wants to head further north...not before taking a quick breather though I think. Looking at 1.3054, 1.3021, 1.2987 and 1.2940 as possible re-entry levels for longs. If 12940 breaks it's likely we'll retest 1.2750 or go even lower, so I'd like this level to hold as confirmation for the up trend. Trix are both above the crucial 0.00000 lines which also suggests we're in an uptrend, at least as long as the slow one stays above 0.00000. They're flattening out though, suggesting a (limited) pullback is likely. On the upside I'm watching the last high of 1.3137 and then 1.3243, 1.3381 and ultimately 1.3529. Fundamental support: Bad US data lately...and no re-emergence of a Cyprus style disaster in Europe. Cyprus is priced in already. Guess this uptrend will receive its major pullback when Slovenia or any of the other countries takes a turn for the worse. Until then I"m biased towards longs. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In terms of EURJPY...it also looks like the general trend is up. But for now all I can say is "holy batman overbought". Pullback very likely, some levels indicated below. CNY and JPY news on Sunday night should move this a good bit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As for USDJPY...also expecting a pullback to one of those levels below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks. Again. Reading carefully what you post, but dont have so much time to answer detailed ;( GBP/USD M30 It seems like a nice entry. But.. No entry till the Candle did not Broke MA5. Also notice the WS1 we sitting right on it. Lets see what happens..

--- 帖子 #727 ---
And the opposite. GBP/USD M5

--- 帖子 #728 ---
And see now..

--- 帖子 #729 ---
The M5 post, forced me to make a micro scalp, Could not resist. Out with 4.8 pips. (+2.4 spread) Was only a 0.1 Lot trade. I learn at most when i take real money.. Speculated on what (then) happened, shown above, scaled down from M5 to M1 and scalped the bounce. Was tricky. Trading, screen capping but made it Of course you cant scalp this way with 2.4 spread but.. For education reason it was a must. Have a closer look. Bounce at Pivot, wait next candle close through the MA5, wait.. next candle close above the MA5, innn

--- 帖子 #730 ---
No trading for me today, had to buy a new dataplan and they won't switch on my new connection for at least another 2hrs

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Aaand finally. M30 One hour and two M30 candles later. Avoided a loss by simply waiting and following the basic rules.. No loss trade is a + trade. Now we could have a (M5 or so) look whats happening at the new magic line. S2

Hi, This is not my thread, but I'm sure that this kind of questions doesn't belong here. For that matter it doesn't belong anywhere since it's obvious that You didn't read the relevant information in the mother thread for all THV related issues....RTFM here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=127271 If You have read some aspects regarding the infopanel You should have found this conversation (among others of course): http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...08#post5903708 Unfortunately, sending questions before reading-searching for previously already formulated answers, makes most of the threads some huge, mega monsters.

1.Waiting London to open. 2.Waiting strong m5 trix wave, not waiting to m5 trix crosse slov and fast line, just wait to m5 trix fast trig begin, then i wait for second wave on m1 trix and the chart confirmation 3.Surfing wave on m1 trix, trying to get in the wave as soon as posible, but looking allso on m1 chart how is seting up for the trade. There are few paterns i am looking, like: m5 trix wave in the wave, and then first wave on m1 trix chart. then two waves in a row, then trigering on m1 trix frist wave.. The best way is to post live pictures.Ill try tu upload live examples. But every user should feel the m1 m5 chart by himself how it is working with trix, and how to take advantage of trix signals on market. Bad english, will try to explane with pictures. Look at this picture, it is old example, but ill try to put fresh pics, tomorow.. http://i45.tinypic.com/20jrbwi.png Here is one more example, look the chart how is going up in the waves and look at bouth trix, m1 and m5.. http://i46.tinypic.com/10r7fi1.png

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Usually it isnt so easy like today, but today im like a machine, next, next.. dont know.. As i wrote, im fully concentrated, slept well, the sun shines and im well tempered. And since Dukascopy lowered their spreads to around 0.4 pips its easier to make those micro scalps and get out with profit.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Oh, I see. This is something a little bit different from the metatrader THV.. i tried to reconstruct those trade (on my Oanda Meta) is it modified for Ducascopy scalp ...? It was only based on the M1 chart? Or you have taken in account higher timeframes too?

--- 帖子 #757 ---
You happy with Dukascopy? I'm still with Oanda and really happy (fast execution, fast payouts, etc.), but 0.4 spread sounds great

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Oanda was my first broker, they are great, but... You have to try Dukas and you will be amazed. Dont know how to explain, but their data feed is much smoother, the M1 candle is like liquid, it flows.. Execution is fast but i also have about 30 % of requotes but i dont care. Its part of the business, even more i can predict when i will receive a re-quote. Its a Ecn and only a fool can expect a 1:1 price execution all the time. You are at the open Sea.. And now i missed a great dump because i wrote. More later ps. Dont forget the commissions with Dukascopy..

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Thx for the advice, will do some more research. Like I said, quite happy with Oanda since I'm not after short term scalps, so paying 1pip or 3pip spreads doesn't really matter all that much for me. Most of my winners are 50pip+ and losers are capped at around 15pips most of the time.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Can you show to us your chart, and your trades for today? wanna see when and how you are executing your trades. Best regards..

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Sorry, but i did not have any trades yesterday, I wasn't focused on trading other than reading stuff.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
That was a almost naked Dukascopy chart, (without Heikin Ashis) where the trades was executed. I use THV on a second screen with the MT4. As usually M1 M5 M15 H1 switching before entering a trade..

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Ok, thanks. Same story here only with Oanda .

--- 帖子 #764 ---
i am done for this week.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I have looked over the pics of the trades that You have posted till now, but I can't figure it out what are You referring to when You mention "Wave"? What I have noticed do, is that in almost every trade that You have posted You have entered when the 5 min Slow Trix line has changed in the desired direction (or in the proximity of that)..changed in colour ..i.e. like if it was a short trade then it changed in red. But this can be only a coincidence. So, You aren't looking to the PA in relation to Coral and Cloud?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I am using m5 fast trix, first i wait when fast m5 trix is on, then i use fast m1 trix to enter the trade... When you observe m1 trix and the chart you can se that m1 trix when it change the colour regarding the trend he is going in a wave... So when i say wave i mean that m1 trix is starting the new wave..( and when m1 trix is starting a new wawe, a new wave on chart starts) No, i dont use coral, cloud, fibos suports etc.. About trix, lot of thv traders are using trix on m5 and wait till it crosses, etc, i dont.. i wait fast trix only to sstart the new wave, and m1 trix to enter in a trade. thats all.. But looking at the chart, if m5 chart goes harder in a trend then i skip the reversal, and wait a litle corelation, and then jump in a trade in the trend direction.. Dont know how to explane,,, every user first have to look hundreds or 1k or more hours on the m5 m1 chart and with that knowlege use trix in your own favor ... the best way is to stady pictures of the traders, to se from their chart why he is on that trade in that specific time,,, look all the indis on the time when hi is entered in a trade.. and be a little anoying aksing a lot of questions , whay this whay this, to be able to get in a mind of the trader.. and then with your all knowledge and experience trade on your own.. Bad english bad...

--- 帖子 #767 ---
EUR/CHF H1 Started this trade yesterday on suspicion. Up 20 pips till now, but as i can see on H1 there is more room down than up from now. A look at H4 D1 reveals the same.. The question now is, being greedy or booking 20 pips and being happy. Edit: adjusted the SL and got stopped out at 1.2235 with 20 pips profit awaiting down, so its ok.

Can I ask a slightly off topic question. How do you find Dukascopy. I have been testing on demo using their MT4 offering but data is shaky. Do you experience any issues on live? Do you bother with their MT4? Thx

--- 帖子 #774 ---
See post 758. And why would you use MT4 with Dukascopy?? I use their charts for trade execution and MT4 from Oanda or Alpari for rough charting. And if you want to use EAs with Dukas, try to build some java EA. They released a great Java Visual EA builder. Also use their forum, a lot of things to find there.

Hey Guys, after some analysing my last weeks trades i wanted to share some charts with my considerations. Trade from 1. Aug: +8,7 Pips Entry: 1. Bounce of 5m Coral 2. MTF shows 4 red lights 3. 15m bearcrossed (cant see that in chart. i swap TF in analyse chart an make some notes on the button right) 4. 5m Trix changed color to red 5. 1m Coral broke Attached Image (click to enlarge) Exit: 1. PA choped around MS2 2. I decided to exit when 1m candle closes above MS2 or 5m fTrix goes green Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #784 ---
another trade 2nd August: -12,3 Pips 1. 5m showed Beardivergence 2. 15m Trix was Overbought and RSI was close under Overbought 3. 1m fTrix went red again Attached Image (click to enlarge) Exit: When i realised that price runs against my trade it was very fast and hit SL Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think my mistake was that my fingers where too fast. I should have waited the close of one 1m candle at least. then i would have seen the 1m HA Candles with ver long wicks. Long wicks with the combination of the R1 should have given me the signs to keep out of this trade. more advises are welcome

hi Toranaga, yes its the correct file for what we want. the other is more for newbies with stupid questions most of time. So, by M1, i think the cobra system advices 3 TP levels. and its more powerfull to my experience I only use CCI 34 in addition, its far enough FOr H1 and H4, im very curious if you can share al lthe curencies you take? all?? and your score about for a month. I understand your way, its smart. big lot on M1 for few pips. and less lot for higher H1 and H4. what SL you use for longer frame? today, 2 big win on eur jpy M5, also looked for M1, 2 times 50 points! have you traded today EUR JPY on M1? for the signals you use on M1, i still dont uderstand if you have specific filters in addition.

Ufff.. Ok. D1/H4 Pairs. Mostly: Gbp/Usd, Aud/Usd, Usd/Jpy, Gbp/Aud Eur/Usd, Aud/Jpy, Eur/Aud. Gbp/Cad, Xag/Usd And sometimes: Usd/Chf, Aud/Nzd, Nzd/Jpy, Gbp/Chf, Gbp/Nzd, Eur/Nzd But i check the correlation between pairs, so if im long in Gbp/Usd D1 and this Pair has a positive 80% D1 correlation with Pair XY i wont trade the XY Pair till im long with Gbp/Usd. Cant tell you the monthly score for long term trades, because the account is mixed with all kind of trades. Ive done hardcore scalping for long time and paused a little in the last months. It is much more relaxed to check the Pairs in the morning and the evening, and one time between and let the Price hit you target. (Or SL) But i think i could start again with some M5 trading, if this here develops, but dont like €/Y much, i dont know why. Gbp/Usd is starting to get my preferred Pair, equal wich Timeframe Trix, CCI and Experimenting a little with MML (Murrey Math Lines) but that was it.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
But i agree, lets focus here on M5 Gbp/Usd and a another Pair.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
hi toranaga! nice days again on pips on the majors gbd usd, eur jpy, and others with gbd i trade also Gbp/Usd, Aud/Usd, , Gbp/Aud Eur/Usd, Aud/Jpy, Eur/Aud. Gbp/Cad, on M5, and i study also M1, it needs concetration but its quite easy make 100 pips a day if you take kets say 3 or 4 max with SL 10 for M1 and 20 for M5 what brooker do you have? maybe you have better spread than mine? i ve 1.5 for eur jpy and 0.9 for gbd usd ( cmc markets ) its very interesting the idea on H1 My experience and research make me think its more easier to entry and make money on H1. but maybe you can tell you see its different? to my view, AUD JPY is interesting for H4. all others great for H1 Now the big question can you share with us your MML template or indicator? how do you mix wit hte trix? to my view, a good CCI is enough with the trix, but you seem more experienced than me, so im sure you can get even more fitlers For H1? what stop you use? i look around 50 pips maximum and want a ratio 2 or 3. i use 2 TP or 3 TP because if BE, at least you make little money. this 3TP levels is given by cobra on THV and its very smart

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I would not say 100 pips a day is impossible but nearly, plus its unnecessary to try that and it boosts your risk too too much. You have to take more signals to achieve that, instead to wait for one or at most 2 "sure" signals per day. And it burns you out. Scalping at this level is a high performance job. Dont need that. I love trading and want to chill while doing that and not to freak out. I use Dukascopy for scalping. Lightning fast execution. For example the €/$ spread is from 0.2 - 0.8 mostly. Plus commission, its graduated, you can lower it f you have a lot of volume.. Have to have a look for the spreads of the other pairs. Thats why i moved from M1 scalping to H4/D1. H1 trading is the same but had to decide for one. Cant follow all Tf in all Pairs. But thinking about to wide the Timeframes and lowed the Pairs.. i have no problem to share the MML indi. We talked here about, few pages back.. At the moment i try to educate myself about it. It is very powerful if you know how to use it. Have a look here.. Having a math degree wouldn be bad.. he he http://www.foretrade.com/MM_description.htm But ass usual a great tool needs a lot of understanding to have the right setup.. As i wrote, i scalp M1, now will try M5 and trade long term H4/D1. Postponed H1 trading till now, but you 'forced' me now I use the THV Ifno Atr 20 for the roughly SL. Then i adjust it, depending of the MML lines, Pivots, Timeframe Candle before and after the timeframe candle i trade and amount of lot and risk im into the trade.. But the criterion is the ATR 20 + -

--- 帖子 #793 ---
One advice, if i may.. (for all who think about scalping) When i started Forex scalping i have done 50 or more trades per day.. If you can do a trade within seconds, in and out in 15 seconds it does not mean you have to do that all the day.. It needs only one per day or better say 2 or 3 per week and its enough.. 10 or 15 pips and its done. 100 pips per day is madness that will break you even if you are successful and manage it to do that.. In my opinion, a successful trader is like a successful hunter. I was on hunt. Not a battue, a usual. Mostly you have to wait for hours only for a single shot. And then it counts. The same is with scalping. You have to wait for the signal the whole day, and then shot and earn 11 pips with 2 lots and its over to this day.. For those who think thats boring, yes it is (sometimes), but better than working in a factory or road construction.. Sitting at home, watching Tv, cooking or doing .. and waiting for the Signal.. ive done worser things in my life.. Think about whats better (easier) 10 pips per day with a 2 Lots trade or 100 pips per day with 0.02 Lot per trade ? Thats the reason why rich people get wealthier and wealthier while the rest stays where they are.. They are not smarter they only minimize the risk in their investments..

--- 帖子 #794 ---
hi toranaga, i appreciate communicate with you. as you do homework and keep humble. lot people here dont do their homework and just want the system without working themsleves. i dont like these people i think 100 pips is a maximum but average 60 pips is quite easy to do even on M5 or on M1. with 2 to 4 currencies on the same time you have to manage and not confuse yourself however! this need a little skill. I uderstand your way, you expect 15 pips day and take only the signals which have the most chances. but in tis case, what is your SL exactly?? and so when you get 15 pips you consider you have finished your day trading, right? its interesting idea, but this would need a ratio of 90% win to my view. but its my opinion only. why not, it can work well. my opinion is more about 60 to 100 pips a day with lowest lots. but we can achieve the same results, it true. friday no very good day on eur jpy however was able to give about 50 pips (i let the M1 entry on the graph, so there are more entry with small profits but giuve also the same resutls. of course you have to accept close a trade with only 5 pips when the trend is reversal and take fast profit one around 10 to 15 . its a work. and sometimes take 5 pips loss and another reversal you are stopped at 20 and have to wait. questions for you: you use only one TP? reconsiderated with 2 or 3 TP even on higher frame, never close last trades too early , wait the cloud reverse. lot of time , this give the best pips. but of course its not guarante you will have this perfect trade. it happens about 1 trade out of 4. i v seen some trade for 50 pips or more on scalping and even 500 pips on H4 explain more how you trade on H1, ok? give us a file. for me, this system thv works on all frames excpet M15 and M30. just follow the rule. its smart to combinate scalping with H1 and H4, yes im sure. also make the risk diversification. NOW, for the H1, i think we can help each other in the best way to do. i can tell you by experience i use H1, its very important use 2 or 3 TP and a ratio about 1/2, 1/3 to up to 1/6 (if the trend go always good with the cloud) expected. i use SL around 40 to 50 pips, no more on H1 and so i expect the ratio on each TP this is more relaxing job, need more margin however. and my result were given me about 25% return month on some curencies with a worth D around 15%, with 4% risk capital on each trade. but i dont give my result like this, i will do in private with you. because the rule is to share with people who work. However, the one who wants to work and kee writing for some weks here for some researches and share the files as i do and toranaga do, with calculation, are of course welcome. but i know by experience on forex mentality, its probably only one people will do or maybe none. the advantage of H1 is that is more relaxing to follow and ave more free time

I apologize for not posting so frequent at the moment here. I would wish the day has 48 hours. The coming weekend i will have more time, maybe also tomorrow so i can answer more detailed to you last post.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
YOU answer when you can... according to the scalp m1 system, CCI double is 34 and 170, however i configurate 34 and 134. everybody has to compare on M5 and M1 with it, with the normal THV rules, and see themselves the results. thats the work to do. for MML, it can be great also. when you have a look at all indicators on MT4, which one are really usefull? you must think about it. if you understand the philosophy of the THV, you can achieve strong results. and accept also some days ranging dont give a lot pips but generally no loose its so rare statitiscs will show here, we can and should do a little review each day traded. maybe by MP to check the motivation of the new on the forums, as everybody has to work have all good day, and keep safe in trading.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Still busy? I've been very busy the past few weeks, huge project at work... Still trading though AUDUSD and EURAUD showing some action tonight Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS: THE best indicator to combine with THV is hands down Ichimoku...especially the multi-timeframe kumo cloud. I trade from H1 charts now but I can see the H4 and daily kumo clouds. This gives me perfect entry exit levels.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Hello, Ninja I see you're actively contributing Hiatus thread. It seems you have become a very successful trader. Congratulations ! ​ My learning curve is a bit lagging but I also have made some progress, still not profitable enough though. I will try Ichimoku when I find time. Thank you for your tips and have a good day.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Is the MTF worth it? I like Misspips idea of M1 entrys while using M5 and M15 as confirmation.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Yes, definitely worth it. The strongest moves seem to happen when multiple Ichimoku clouds "match up".

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Heya Give me a shout if you have Ichimoku questions. This should get you started: LINK

Finally FF got rid of the Voucher System . Great !!! Its a boost for FF. Btw. will continue here. Soon. After the consolidation phase, that still lasts.. Have to be sure what i do. Stay tuned if you want. Ive made few big additions in my trading system that kicked out few of my components and brought Focus to other. Darvins Evolution. One of them is back to the Roots, aka Trendlines . Never trust a Indicator more than a (well drawn) trend line.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Friendly advice...check out market profile indicators, they rooooooock together with THV (or any other trend based system). Great to time entries, set stop losses, and also take advantage of ranging markets. I use this indicator: LINK The POC levels are amazing. Ranging markets aren't any issue any longer and I cut down a at least 50% of my losers since taking this into consideration.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Thanks! You assigned me a weekend homework. By the way, do you use default settings except colors and 'Days_with_the_histogram'? This is my settings: Attached Image Attached Image Will this fine? Cheers,

--- 帖子 #807 ---
For easy description of Market Profile, see: http://pivotboss.com/2010/06/01/mark...ile-made-easy/

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I show the histogram for 5 days to limit stress on CPU...but show the POC lines for 10 days.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Got it. I set Max day of calcuation to 10. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #810 ---
During ranging days, just play the extreme histogram ranges. So whenever price hits the outlier zone on top, sell...and vice versa. The virgin points of control levels make it fairly easy to spot whether a market is ranging or trending (or when a trend changes direction for good). Here's my template by the way: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just ask yourself "are we above yesterday's POC or not?" every day and you stand a decent chance of being on the right side of a trade. I exit when the slow Trix changes color on the H1.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thank you so much Ninja. I even don't know how to thank you. First pipware Practal, then Ichimoku, and now Market Profile... I have learned a lot from you. I really appreciate your generous help! By the way, it looks you set Displacement_GMT to London open. Is this better than default GMT+0? Also, I don't see Ichimoku Cloud in your chart anymore. Did you discard the cloud? Just curious... There are many good Youtube videos for Market Profile. I am watching those videos now to learn more. cheers,

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I still use the cloud, but not on the same template...I like my charts clean and prefer to switch templates instead. Having said that, funny enough the POC and cloud boundaries are often fairly similar...which also goes for historic Kijun Sen levels. I also cut down on the number of trades and now only take trades if the indicators "scream at me". Focusing a lot on these high probability setups has really paid of lately.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Oh, I see. Thank you very much for your feedback. Have nice pips! cheers,

With a big trade that touches his nose a crocodile can survive months without trading..

As i stated it here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...57#post7620857 pending further notice, this thread will take care about GBP/USD with or without THV. Feel free to post, but only with a chart and a explanation. Again, i dont have time to play childish games, im here to make money post or read profitable ideas and that is it. Nothing more nothing else.. !!! So, lets go. Preferred H4 and higher but as we all know it is always the same schema, so lower time frames are also allowed if profitable. What i dont want to read is, i think, i wish, it could, because if then, bulls bears blah.. aso Show the chart and over and out !! Lets get it. Gbp is the game.. (at the moment)
