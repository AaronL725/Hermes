@ first, sorry for my bad English My TradingMethod has 3 basic Ideas: 1. PA: 50% 2. 2 Fast EMAs (Floor Trading System) and sometimes I add the 100Ema: 10% 3. common Sense: 40% 1) PA plays main Role in my Method, I am not a very good PA-Trader, but I understand the Chart Structures (Trend, Range, Reverse) and the importance of Key Levels, it is enough for my simple Trading. IMHO The best PA-Book: Al Brooks “Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar”, 400 Pages, 330 Charts. It is a very hard Job to read it, but it is worth it. I begun to read this Book on 1. September 2016 and read it constant. Now I understood it much better then 2016, but I am not ready with this Book else. This Book is my trading Guru, it is my Holy Grail. 2) 2 EMAs (Eg 8,20 or 8,18) or 3 EMAs (8,20,100) I use them mainly as a graphic tool to show me the actual Chart Structure: a Trend or a Range. Sometimes 3 MAs help me to see the TrendsMoves a bit better and it is very important for me: I make more Money in the Trends. Sometimes there are bounce or PuB Setups near them too. Good PA-Traders see these Setups without MAs, but my Brain does not. Therefore I need these 2 or sometimes 3 Helpers. EMAs are useful in Trends only, but with PA it is possible to trade the Ranges and Reverses near the Key Levels . I have 2 clear Templates only: -the first with 8,18EMAs - and another one with 8,20,100MAs. If necessary I draw TLs and Sup and Res Lines, otherwise stay Charts clear without garbage. 3) Common Sense is very important for Trading, it comes with experience. It can say U for Example, don't trade today this Pair, it is a tight Range now on the Chart, don't burn Ur Money!!!! I don’t read some News, I have stopped to read other Threads about Trading Systems and so on, too many Inputs to process in the trading Time, it is very bad for me. I read my Charts only and it is enough for my simple Trading and I try to use a small SL. I am not a Teacher, I want to show in this Thread a possibility for a simple Trading with clear Charts only, it is not for everybody, but for Traders who like to read and understand the Charts. I trade H1 mainly, H4, D1 seldom I will place some of my Trading Charts here with Loss and Winn. Please, place Ur Charts without any other Indicators, only with MAs I have a runnig Trade from Friday s. Chart atb vvm Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi there, I have entered GN with the trend. I just use Heikin Ashi + EMAs for this. Do you mind me using Heikin Ashi?

Hi TheHusla, U are welcome I have no Idea about Henki Ashi, but if U trade with MAs only I don’t mind! Atb vvm

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Perfect thanks. For this strategy I like to keep things as simple as possible. The candle sticks are just averaged and give simple indication of up or down direction with colour. Just FYI. EMAs I use are 14/50/200 and mainly look at the angle and separation of EMAs to judge how strong the up/down move is.

First one to start the week: CHFJPY, nice strong trend and we have the green candle for buy rejecting the EMA.

Update - SL Hit. Still looking for longs. Update (11am) - no longer looking for longs. Price is just consolidating, will see if SL getting hit was just very unlucky or price wants to come lower first before going higher.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I like your second trade. I do the same. When something very obvious fails, I look for taking a trade in that direction. Shame you closed it as that demand at the bottom was fresh so good chance price would get there. The wick was caused by the gap before the demand. Easy to say in hindsight!

PA + CS good luck

--- 帖子 #24 ---
hi vvm, the thread title caught my attention immediately! there is a very similar style being discussed here if your interested: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...lping-strategy here is a quick example of a trade i just closed, all my trades are based on PA, EMA's and as much common sense as possible but that's debatable! Attached Image (click to enlarge) was looking for a rejection of ema200 but that failed so based on the trend leading up to the breakout took out a long position based on ema200 now becoming support then missed the obvious pullback after the first failed attempt but took another long after testing support Attached Image (click to enlarge) so mostly looking to trade pullbacks, tests of support\resistance and breakouts both failed and successful of ema200 the primary focus though is on emas9, 20 and 50, so when price moves far from ema9 like in the yellow circle above, we expect a pullback at some point and use cost averaging or dynamic manual stop losses to manage risk, anyway, thought i'd chime in on what looks like becoming an interesting thread

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Very nice simple trade. Very nice one. I got a bit bored today of waiting on higher time frames as nothing looks interesting to me, so decided to go lower time frame today.

Hi niks, Unfortunately it is not for me, there are to many Imputs on the Charts, I try to trade after Al Brooks with a fast clean Chart atb vvm

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Very nice. What was your entry confirmation for this trade? Did you enter on M1? And yes I also trade traditional candlesticks when the basic Heinkin Ashi is not showing me anything interesting. I initially thought this thread was a basic EMA strategy but I can now see it's more complex. My EMA strategy is very simple. I look for H4/D1 EMA14 Rejections &amp; D1 EMA200 rejections and filter the ones that look good for me. This is using normal candlesticks. And also use HA candles to identify good trends and entries. The confirmation HA candle must reject the EMA14. Outside of that I also look for scalps using S&amp;D zones. I can now see your strategy is not the usual momentum following EMA strategy so I'll post my other trades here too but will keep the chart clean!

Post 1: My TradingMethod has 3 basic Ideas: 1. PA: 50% 2. 2 Fast EMAs (Floor Trading System): 10% 3. common Sense: 40% atb vvm

--- 帖子 #38 ---
i understand, but i gave you the wrong link, sorry - this is the right one, the first 8 posts on this first page: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...lping-strategy you will see here there are no indicators except ema 9, 20, 50 and 200 plus tick volume, anyway, just in case you want to double check, because the rest of the thread talks about variations with indicators which is also not for me... i started trading with completely naked chart and learnt my trading through price action as well, only recently i have added the emas and sometimes tick volume for extra guidance using the KoF basic EMA strategy which has made a significant difference for me, mostly regarding my risk management so i noticed you are using same basic principles and will keep an eye on it...

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hi thehusla, that first trade was very well executed, can you please explain the second trade a bit? and do you have anything to add regarding your risk management style?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks niks, I'll check it Sorry, cann U explain it?? atb vvm

--- 帖子 #41 ---
of course vvm, once you read the thread it will make sense, but here is an example played out just now, the basic idea is when the price over extends from the ema9, expect it to pullback into and beyond ema9 for a target Attached Image (click to enlarge) the stop loss is up to you, i used one here because ema200 may have been broken, but instead you can take ANOTHER position at the bottom and aim for the same target i.e cost averaging or use it to manage your risk also on the other thread, you will find a link to Kof strategy on youtube and you can see the strategy being traded live, he did a live video yesterday, i will send you link if you can't find it here is another example, the idea is that as it breaks and holds each ema, it will continue on, how far is up to you, i was waiting for ema200 on this one but never made it Attached Image (click to enlarge) and here's an example with cost averaging, not the best one as i was managing aggressively but generally i would take multiple positions where i stopped myself out, but of course that carries its own risks, and should of held a bit longer because it broke ema200 as i was expecting but set the SL for the second order too tight and missed out on the original TP, its a very dynamic system i hope this gives you the general idea of how it works Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Sure the zone I highlighted was the liquidity used to get above the high to the left and when price came back I was looking for continuation longs. Then price action showed no signs of holding that zone and once it broke below I knew there was a high chance of that low getting hit. Hope that helps. My risk management is 1.5R every trade with continuous compounding.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
thanks, it helps a lot - do you use fixed stop loss and do you have example where you are compounding?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Yes everything is defined when I enter a trade. I don't change anything. Wicks are a pain but for solid risk management I need fixed stops. if I get stopped out by a wick then I will decide if I want to re-enter. Mostly I don't as need to make sure the re-entry is not emotional based and purely logic based which sometimes is a little hard directly after a loss. I don't have any example of my compounding but it's very simple, I just take 30% of the balance and aim for 1.5R. I start with a small balance.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Took a hit on gold, looks like an unlucky loss but then this came up: EMAs turned, rejection of the EMA14 and zone was breaking.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
very nice trade, could of doubled up with a re-entry at 162.38 once support became resistance, hindsight of course! for the loss you took with gold, especially if it was unlucky, it might be worth just considering if cost averaging down may have saved the day and thanks for sharing your risk management and compounding techniques... edit: it looks like your trade used the same entry logic as vvm's earlier trade here which appears to work very well... i also understand why cost averaging would hamper your compounding strategy

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks. Cost averaging into a trade makes the compounding more complex and I try and keep that aspect of trading very simple. No worries, I'm pretty sure I read the compounding stuff on here somewhere. So many threads discuss it. Also came across a gold trader years ago who coined the concept 'house money' and did exactly this. Also some Malaysian traders (Bystra and others) do the same.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
yes, risk management in a tight range can be tricky and frustrating! here is one i just worked through, the first was expecting continuation up above ema200 but failed, the second was looking for counter trend but exited too early, until finally the last countertrend attempt worked! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) thank you for accepting my input, and i certainly am not suggesting you change your style in any way, but because you have very similar ideas to how i have traded for many years, i just want to make you aware of this system best of luck with your trades and look forward to seeing more of them...

it happens, in hindsight it is always easy to see... nice trade, obviously a bit late, but i would of suggested 1.3650, hope you hit it i have trouble hitting targets with higher timeframes, for me it boils down to fundamentals regarding the USD before technicals on the chart, fundamentally it was strong, and technically, 1.3650 provided a safe target had a quick look at the daily for the audusd and saw a beautiful head and shoulders building up with the break occurring over the last three days providing a windfall for whoever caught it!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
thanks, i agree - very good analysis using 1234 entry 1 was most aggressive and a bit early but still ok, stop loss could be on retest of high entry 2 was best because it completes head and shoulders for extra confirmation and now there is tighter stop loss and better RR and yes, if price continue to fall, then look for pullback opportunity short! but on this timeframe, it all depends on USD

--- 帖子 #68 ---
thanks. Took a hit on this trade unfortunately. That last move up got me before the drop. I think my SL placement was okay, was just a tricky move. Decided not to re-enter. Nice chart! thanks.

NZDJPY. This was a daily strategy trade where I just look for EMA rejections. Then look for any entry that makes sense. In this case as price is in a range I am just targeting the other end of the range. It's a very simple strategy. Once I see a EMA rejection on the daily I look for an entry which can be any S&amp;D zone (as defined by Sam Seiden) or just the latest high/low.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
that is a tricky one but it might get there, 67.05 may be\have been a safer target, i'm currently cost averaged long and will take another entry if your target hits so i hope it gets there for you, but if it breaks and holds ema200 from here your stop may be in danger Attached Image (click to enlarge) well it has broken ema200 if it holds be careful... good luck!

The bad luck I have with this pair in the last two weeks is unreal. Partial loss as I tightened the SL which would have been hit by that wick anyway. I could have gone for a bigger range but the problem is we are still firmly down therefore I went for the safest range possible and the SL was proportional.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Was very confident on the range, unlike yesterday therefore left the SL alone and just let the trade play out. Reason why is Nice fundamentals on this trade as UK has come to a deal with the EU regarding Northern Island. I don't really follow fundamentals, just real obvious stuff. TP 1.5R.

Cheers, yeah we can see the idea was fine, just tricky PA. Was a shame it didn't work as it looked very good. Should really have continued monitoring for a secondary entry.

Hard to tell which would happen in this case IMO. 2/3 ain't too bad for today! Hope you had a good day mate!

--- 帖子 #123 ---

--- 帖子 #169 ---
sorry to see this loss - in hindsight i see two main problems that caused it to fail first is the ema rejections showing a downtrend, and second, from a lesson i learnt during a webinar that never occurred to me regarding engulfment, is, out of the three engulfment's that are circled, which one is the MOST powerful and why? Attached Image (click to enlarge) the second is the most powerful engulfment because it is the one that engulfs the largest bar, the second most powerful engulfment is also bearish, the bullish engulfment you relied on engulfed a very small weak candle which is also a weak engulfment anyway, thanks for sharing...

niks, thanks for Sharing too atb vvm

--- 帖子 #171 ---
my pleasure vvm - i know the feeling of being in a "hurry" to make a trade - and the consequences as well! and just one final thought on this one - it is also obvious now that the weak bullish engulfment's were in this case and and generally are the best times to oppose them, not follow them...

If posting live is affecting your psychology then don't do it. MUST remember we are in this game for ourselves not for anyone else. We post online to help ourselves with our trading. Nice! I was looking at the same but no R:R for me. Frustrating day for me. Was watching EU with same idea from last Friday. The candle that I was watching to enter on didn't engulf so I couldn't enter and the next candle confirmed the trade but I never got a retrace for an entry.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I was actually looking for shorts as I saw no reason to buy. Reason attached. Strong downtrend. VERY steep trendline. It's similar to your other EJ trade where it is reacting to a key zone but no change in structure.

Don't worry, sometimes mine is as well. We are all learning.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
that's for sure, price action like anything else in trading is never guaranteed more often, what might appear to be a correct reading turns out to be false... this trade i just finished was 50\50 in terms of price action on the ema200, but i would of normally taken a short on price action alone, but went long instead, there was an indicator involved behind this particular trade decision, but as we don't discuss them here, i'll claim it was the price action alone after the last bullish candle broke and held ema200 despite the wicks suggesting otherwise!

I'm glad this worked for you bro! This wasn't a trade for me but it worked well! I guess we will always see things differently based on how we view the markets but the times that we are in agreement are interesting to compare analysis! I was looking for something coming into NY open but didn't see anything I liked. Almost sold that H1 bar down but the low of previous bar was intact so decided against it.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I just look for rejections to EMA then filter based on if I "like" the setup or not. It's hard to fully explain but this was just a failure of price to go down so I thought it must go up. Shorts looked good last week but failed this week which was weird and so I thought longs. Thanks though!

What do you mean by fall when you say ? Okay, I wasn't aware that you trade one timeframe in isolation. I would strongly recommend you just at least include structure on all higher TFs + entry TF in your journaling. Even if you don't use it now, I'm confident it will be valuable data for you in the future. Hope you have a nice day too mate.

EURGBP SOLLED H1 We can see break of structure and trend line down holding. I wasn't very confident about how far down this trade could go therefore was tightening the stop very quickly. After that one spike to my entry I put it to almost B/E and then after that to B/E. This wasn't a trade where I just leave the SL alone but one I wasn't sure about but was sure it would go down a bit therefore reduced my risk as quickly as possible while giving it just enough room to breathe.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
The mistakes teach us lessons too. The trick is not to feel bad when we make them but to get VERY VERY VERY curious as to why we did and what steps we can take in the future to avoid them. This is IMO This move was VERY messy for me. My SL might have been taken here but I exited at breakeven. With such a clean range I don't want to see two legged PB in this case. The problem is structure is up so it's risky and I want a clean move. I got lucky this time! Yes! That line you drew and said don't buy here, that was EXACTLY my thinking. Was a mistake. I acted too quickly without thinking it through properly. Doesn't happen too often but happens on days/weeks where I don't see many trades.

--- 帖子 #213 ---

I understand you use Al Brooks but there are many many many ways to trade. No way is better than the other. I have spoken to many traders who tell me Elliot Wave is the only way to read the markets yet I don't use it all. You just have to find what works for you. My previous comment was just my interpretation of your trade. A lot of traders with wildly different theories take the same trades for completely different reasons. The key, for me, is just to learn what you can from others while maintaining your style, your view of the markets. Use other's trades to widen your perspective but always maintain your personal view. Thanks for the exert from his Book! I looked at his stuff and it's very very deep. It will take a long time to properly study theory so deep. I really try and stick to the absolute basics (S&amp;D, SnR, Liquidity &amp; Structure) and let the market teach me the rest through my failures. I will try and encoporate small things from these quotes you post though, so thanks!

I really like your EURCHF trade, can't fault it. I was busy today after the morning so didn't spend much time in front of charts. This week wasn't the best for me on the H1 strategy. Well done on finishing up. I agree, next week should be better. I run multiple strategies and although the H1 strategy wasn't the best, the H4/D1 EMA Rejections were nice this week. It's such an effective strategy that one. Also scalping trades that I don't post here was good this week. Have a nice weekend mate! Thanks for your screenshots and explanations! This exchange is ideal.

Scalping I just monitor around market open. LN open and NY open. I keep four charts open (GOLD, GU, EJ, GJ as need high movement pairs for scalping &amp; normally keep the charts on M15) and go down to LTF when I see something. Very very rarely go to M1 but normally just M5/M15. (If I don't see anything I just close the charts) This strategy is hard to explain. H1 I just scan the markets at 45 past the hour, looking for anything interesting. All the stuff I post here. Mostly looking for engulfs and if the engulf direction makes sense to me. If something looks interesting but I'm not sure I will keep an eye on M30 for just this pair using my phone. H4 EMA- I check 15 mins before candle close for any EMA rejections that look interesting and I usually enter with a pending order. (Takes around 5-10 mins max, 3 times a day) D1 EMA - 15mins before D1 close, I check all daily candles for EMA rejections that look interesting and again usually enter with a pending order. (Takes 5-10 mins max, once a day) The EMA ones are the easiest but scalping has big potential for big profits fast. H1, trains me in everything in between.

Not sure if this one is valid for you but for me it looked good but I always struggle to take these kinds of trades. I think it's a psychological thing of selling when it's already sold so much. However when the signals come I must pull the trigger. Very simple break and re-test and rejection of EMA with evening star. I'm going to post trades I missed or was considering and didn't take as well and happy to discuss. This week looks set to be a good week!

nice trades vvm and thehustla maybe not so bad to stand aside a bit this week vvm, volumes are through the roof and price action is wild on the 1M timeframe, triple witching hour this friday so lots of repositioning! not even sure if this sequence is legible, it was meant to be based on price action, but it is moving so fast it is hard to keep up! it was profitable though... Attached Image (click to enlarge) i'll post more of mine and review some of your trades when i get more time, but please keep posting!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
that makes sense! but in case you are not aware, the range you have marked off is very important - it is what they call these days an "order block" created by big banks - this means when price moves away and retraces back into it, there might be a high probability trading opportunity, so its worth keeping your eye on it for this scenario to occur...

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hey, yeah I'm not seeing anything today on the higher time frame strategies but got a gold scalp in the morning that looked good. Real shame I hesitated in the morning with ECHF as was a good trade. With your screenshots, can I request some basic annotation? It's really hard to understand the rationale for any of your trades. If it's too much for all your trades, as your volume is quite high then just a couple that you really liked would be good. Glad you finished up mate!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
thanks, price action will be volatile all week, especially friday, good for quick clean scalps, but highly risky if a trend breaks out against you or if using stop losses yes, of course, i'll add descriptions to each screenshot, i'm not much of an annotator, if its still unclear, please just let me know then i'll mark up the snapshots as well... that last sequence i posted was all over the place, the rationale was in my mind but wasn't quick enough to execute it, and i missed the last double bottom, so wasn't pleased with it either! but it got me through the day so here's a better one this morning that i can put some words to... EURUSD 1M the first entry short was based on trend continuation after a pullback to ema9, no stop loss was used, the plan was to continue entering as each ema was hit, then ema20 got hit and entered the second short entry, targets based on reaching prior low - if ema50 had hit, i would of entered again if price action was right normally i would play the counter trend prior to these entries as well but this weeks volatility makes me very cautious at the point of this snapshot, it is VERY difficult to hold as it was already in decent profit and i start getting ready to close, is that fear??? but my intuition tells me to hold until target - is that greed??? it feels like it sometimes and others it doesn't, this time it didn't Attached Image (click to enlarge) and intuition paid off well in the end... Attached Image (click to enlarge) just realised this was actually a beautiful mini head and shoulders that broke the neckline to help reach the target!

Thanks for all the explanations man. Your scalping is kind of similar to mine but I wait for very clear PA. I actually post those trades on another thread just because it's very different to vvm's trades. Check out the thread here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14359660 . That guy has a really nice template with some very simple indicators for trend. I use it inline with structure for scalping only. I had a GJ short which I needed a pullback to enter into today but never got it and the range I was looking for got filled. Then didn't see anything clear for longs. Like you I try and put scalping positions to B/E as quickly as possible. I really try and enter with momentum such that there is no more than 1 wick to my entry. Get quite a few B/E's but still the winrate excluding B/E's makes it worthwhile. I honestly haven't seen anything decent on the strategy for this thread today. Price is just retracing and I don't take counter-trend trades on this strategy. UC shorts looked okay but I was at the gym at the time. Big news in a bit.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
no problem thehusla, i'll try and annotate a bit more... that thread, thread starter and system look good, however, the indicators are not for me, if your scalps are based on price action, i'm sure vvm wouldn't mind! my entries are loosely based on price action, but not fixed. i will allow a couple of pips for multiple tops or bottoms, entries for trend continuation or countertrend trades back to ema9 and beyond are subjective based on distance from ema's and price structure. not necessarily a PA signal, exits are sometimes fixed, sometimes dynamic using ema's and PA, risk is managed the same dynamic way - deciding to cost average or use stop loss, somewhere in between all that i try and fit in some common sense!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I just use that system for entries so makes sense to post there, also use his indicators. The trend one is a really nice one. I just use it as a sanity check with structure. This thread is a really good one for H1 &amp; H4. It's good you have such a fluid system. I believe in these kinds of systems but it just takes a while to train your subconscious. And yeah, I understand your cost averaging but I just control risk by tightening my SL. I personally think with SL, TP fixed, it makes the process much easier. I just have to focus on winrate. Like I said, I get a lot of Breakevens but don't need many winners in a week to make stellar progress! Best of luck bro!

@vvm - I ALMOST took this, but decided against it because of that zone I drew. What do you think of that trade?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
excellent, perfect entry. doesn't get much better than that! the price action signal i see in this one was a failed breakout of the previous high that struggled to hold trapping the longs Attached Image (click to enlarge) thanks for sharing, i wouldn't mind seeing more of those...

--- 帖子 #283 ---
certainly agree indicators can be helpful in making decisions - i primarily use ema's and tick volumes, and sometimes a combination of oscillators also agree that both you and vvm are showing off nice PA based 1H, 4H and daily trades and enjoy seeing them. unfortunately, those timeframes don't work for me, but the PA principles remain the same on the 1M timeframe... the fluidity of my trading has only recently developed over the last six months now, i was trading fixed rules prior to that with mixed results. but since adopting a truly discretionary and dynamic approach my results have vastly improved you have sound risk and money management rules in place from what i can gather thehusla and that's all that really matters regardless of strategy, best of luck to you too mate!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Cheers bro! I've always thought, the market doesn't follow strict rules therefore why would a successful approach? Fluidity is the key as being married to a "setup" has caused me a lot of problems in the past. Ultimately all we have is direction, range and an entry. And yes, with fixed R and never touching my TP and just my SL as the trade develops it really simplifies a lot of complexities of trade management and makes the process A LOT easier for me. I always try and get things as easy/simple as possible.

simplicity makes decision making a lot easier - as you say, we don't have much raw information to work with, but the little we have plus our intuition will ALWAYS be better than relying on any indicator or fixed rules, having worked on EA's for a long period of time has taught me that the hard way - they promise so much, but take away much more as the market dynamics continually shift - consistency is dependent on remaining dynamic - each and every trade is unique and must be handled accordingly to cap off the point on simplicity, i have simplified my PA signals to the absolute basics, double\triple tops and engulfments are top of my list, outside bars, pin bars and a few others are also considered as an example, look at the double tops that formed on both EU and AU, both very easy to manage and profitable trades, just wish i had taken them!

I have spent a lot of time on EAs as well and that is my end game. I still think they are possible but I'm still putting together how, in my head. For now just focusing on my trading and nothing else. Every trade is unique! Well said.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Your scalping style is almost identical to mine. A shift from my entry zone and it goes to B/E. unlucky here but nicely managed your risk.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
another failed breakout and your on the right end of it, awesome... rather than being the indices, perhaps its just your read of PA that's having a good run!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
definitely, risk management is priority number 1, especially when scalping volatile markets i can't complain too much , my pin bar trade prior to this was the same, much was left on the table, but profit is profit and i've learnt to accept leaving much behind but of course always looking to maximise it - this week is difficult though with very fast movements so really not much i can do about it except get greedy!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
ye, i still get that buzz every now and then, though each journey is getting further apart and shorter lived they can be lucrative for short periods of time, which is where the allure comes from, but you never know when they have failed until its too late to rectify, and they ALL will fail at some point, you have to be quick enough to catch it before it does some will argue if it was possible, the banks would simply run their holy grail script and do away with all investors, is that reality? i do wish you the best of luck in your exploration but caution you to manage the time you spend on them very efficiently but most importantly, soak in the lessons they teach when they fail... i believe you have an excellent read of PA, and combined with your risk and money management, that is all you need

What sorcery is this? What was that entry based off?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
shame you missed that double top, it was a nice one... i also thought the same when i came across this method, it looked to good to be true until i started doing it myself! WARNING - it is EXTREMELY risky if you start to cost average - large drawdowns for sustained periods are inevitable the entry is purely subjective simply based on an over extension from ema9, looking for some PA to enter countertrend, mainly wicks, then cost averaging until it reverses, using return to ema's and PA for targets the bits in yellow are visually obvious entry points for countertrend - the question mark is not, it is still very close to the ema's, an entry here would be based on other factors like previous resistance Attached Image (click to enlarge)

hey vvm, this one is 50\50 when i look at it technically, and also when i think about it fundamentally due to being a daily timeframe technically, the downtrend started by the even bigger inside bar circled on the left and made a strong move down, then bounced off support three times as you highlighted, however, the third retracement down was strong and sharp threatening to breach ema100, and the inside bar you entered on was a relatively small one the target was rejected sharply last time it was reached so may have trouble finding its way there again - this one should be managed carefully if it continues moving sideways fundamentally, its very difficult to tell with the trouble brewing in the financial sector at the moment and i am in no position to comment on this, but you should research that further to understand where this trade is heading to achieve an optimal result, best of luck! Attached Image (click to enlarge) feel free to elaborate on why this is the first time you have used a limit order - i have NEVER used them and never will, for me, its hard enough predicting a winning trade let alone trying to predict EXACTLY what price is going to do!

Hi niks thank you for your professional feedback Unfortunately I have no idea about fundamentals and technical things I try to trade the bars. In this specific case, I'm trading the one Bar Range from low of the Bar 3 to its high....

--- 帖子 #307 ---
always a pleasure vvm, you do have plenty of ideas for technical things, that's what price action is all about! i've had mixed results trading the one bar range, it is a tricky one, and ye, the probabilities aren't the highest for a fixed setup like this, but the idea is reasonable and the price action supports it... hopefully it pops a lot higher monday morning, then you can lock some more in! fundamental things is just reading up on the latest news from this website for example, maybe some high impact news can cause a dramatic shift, glad to see you have protected this one though so you can relax for the weekend!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
So you entered this one because it was overextended to the downside and you saw a wick on M1? This one seems highly risky to me personally. Did you have a zone that it reached on higher timeframes? I get you were trading the pullback here.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Nice man! This one wasn't a trade for me. I don't like these HUGE very fast moves too much. I can see you have good success with them but for me I always enter and it reverses. I was looking to scalp this but it all just went too fast.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
This I REALLY like, but didn't see it. VERY nice trade man! Hope it works for you. Based on this I know what I am looking for on Monday! Put the EMA 200 on your chart. Change the visibility to D1 only. Rejections of the EMA200 on D1 are HIGHLY effective in strong trends.

Many Thanks Mate, I did it have a nice Weekend atb vvm

--- 帖子 #316 ---
yes, overextended plus wick! and yes, extremely risky, that's why i added the WARNING! the risk is only mitigated by cost averaging, when you do these enough times it gets a lot easier to manage, no other factor plays into these trades other than projection of direction and action to take when it does or does not head in that direction, they are traded with VERY strict money management rules a couple of quick examples EURUSD 1M lets say you enter on the first circle, it is overextended and you saw a wick right! that doesn't go well, so you enter a second order because you saw another wick! but then it keeps going against you and this time you get a clearer signal so you enter a third order, now things are looking good and you start focusing on your target and enjoy your profits! Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDUSD 1M on the other hand, because seeing a wick during an overextension works so well, we try it again at the first circle for example, and like the first trade, we're sure its going to reverse so we enter another two orders, this time however, things are different, we are in drawdown and our break even point appears out of reach, now we're in a short term drawdown that needs to be managed very aggressively to get out of it with the best outcome before we let it run into a deep long term drawdown, THATS THE RISK that needs to be dealt with... Attached Image (click to enlarge) of course "seeing a wick" can manifest itself in many ways including entering a zone or PA signal

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I see what you mean. You cut your losses quick and let winners run. Also over time will develop a better intuition. I see you like to trade reversals, I would recommend you also look at continuations. So take all your losses in a week and think "What if I had entered the opp direction". Would it have resulted in better performance? Then just do the analysis and change your view accordingly. Just stay fluid. If it resulted it better performance then good and if not then no harm done.

Hi there, I am placing 10 charts here with possible H1 setups for yesterday, Friday, March 17th That's just my point of view atb vvm

--- 帖子 #319 ---
cost averaging is used with the aim of always breaking even or better, cutting losses quick is not the approach, instead, giving the trade every possible chance to produce a profit is where the risk and money management skills lie - every trade is geared towards the earliest possible exit to minimise risk most certainly gets easier over time, and there are effective methods for dealing with a drawdown to end it in a small loss, breakeven or small profit, even after a 100+ pip move against my original position! i have been considering trend continuations more recently and am starting to take those trades as well, i just don't ride them, instead i will exit and re-enter if possible i used that thought process during my ea development - what if i just did the opposite? didn't work out too well for me! thanks for the feedback, i'll continue to remain fluid and see where that leads...

that's brilliant vvm! "every trade is wrong until proven right" is another way of looking at it...

--- 帖子 #323 ---
BTCUSD 1M (DEMO) check this out thehustla, an example of the power of cost averaging - leading on from the quotes vvm just posted, that is the philosophy behind these trades, that we never know where price will go, but it will all make sense if we understand price action when it does go where it goes! for example, price action led me to believe that price would reverse on my first long entry, with a plan that if it doesn't, i will continue to add orders until it does - the timing of each order and the total number of orders used are critical components of the risk and money management backing these trades the two lines i've drawn are when price returned to a small profit and i could of exited at this points, but decided to hold for the purpose of this example, i would of considered closing here if it was live, with a small but decent profit well below my initial entry Attached Image (click to enlarge) but as is often the case with these trades (not always), if the signs are right and you hold until your initial targets are hit, then your in for a windfall... wish i had the same courage live! i lost count of the number of pips this just hauled in, my pip counter broke down!!!

Really nice trade mate. I missed my entry this morning. Was looking at something else at the time and the trade I put on, never got activated unfortunately. Nice one.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Thanks for the interesting thread VVM. Quick question for you - I've often found that the illiquid times of the day can give a misleading view on certain bar setups. For example, its not uncommon to see IBs in the specific 4(8)hr period that you've highlighted, and I was wondering if your experience has given you a different take on this? Clearly this trade has played out well and I'm just curious to get your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Sorry, I don't have anyIdea about "illiquid times" The main Question for me: If the Bars are large enough without long Tails if so, I'll trade this Chart, otherwise I don't Every Setup has its Probability in this Fall maybe 65-35 in my Fovour it is my Decision to take it or don't....

Yes I understand that but all I'm saying is, as per the definition of an inside bar. The first bar is not an inside bar. Unless my understanding is wrong, which I wanted to check with you. Yes sorry, my mistake. It was a IB + OBDown + Engulf Up pattern. Nun, es ist ein bisschen unvernünftig zu erwarten, dass die ganze Welt Englisch spricht. Ich versuche anderen zu helfen, wo ich kann oder wo ich denke, dass ein Kommunikationsproblem dazu führt, dass sie mich nicht verstehen.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
We seem to be going round in circles here. If it's a three bar pattern then the first bar should be an inside bar. The high of the first bar goes above the previous bar which is why I'm saying it's not an inside bar. After that bar there is a VERY nice outside bar which you said is the main bar of the pattern. This makes perfect sense. After the OB we have another IB and then enter on the breakout. However the only thing that doesn't make sense is how you can say it's a three bar pattern of IB-OB-IB when the first candle is not an IB. The quote from the book only talks about an inside bar after an outside bar. Therefore this is a two candle pattern.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thank you bro! I will look out for it. I will try and read Al Brooks but the book is very deep and at this stage I don't want to go into any big new theory. Small candlestick patterns I am happy to look at within the context of the way I see the market.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
So I wouldn't say this is as strong as your previous one on UC. The reason is liquidity. Liquidity sits above/below all Highs and lows. The bigger the swing low (higher the TF you can see it) the better. Your previous trade spiked a lot of very key levels and came to weekly demand. So you had a range then a big spike and then a green candle on H1. Much stronger. Also on your AN trade it's similar. You can see price spiked that swing high to the left. But AN was even better as structure was CLEAR on HTF. Both amazing trades.

Both ended in B/E. To be honest FX hasn't been very clear for me in the last two weeks. UCAD this week that vvm took was perfect but for whatever reason, I missed it. I hate holding positions over the weekend. Only if I have a big SL + it's almost at TP will I do it. No, that's not a U pattern. I have been looking for one but haven't seen a clean one to show you recently. It's a strong move down, then price bases for a little while then a strong move up. Different from the V patterns (QM, H&amp;S) in that it doesn't have a left shoulder and price bases before reversing instead of just coming down then reversing right away. I will keep an eye out for one and post when I see it. Yes, I am very tempted to return to gold M1!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
thanks for the info on holding over the weekend - look forward to seeing one of these U patterns! you could always practice your 1M scalps on BTC over the weekend! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi there, Today is Sonday and I show here 10 H1 Charts from Friday 24.03.23 with possible Setups. There are 2 kinds of Setups here: 1. SimpleSetups, everybody can see them 2. TrickySetup, this Setups are invisible for most Traders Eg a BuySetup after a failed SellSetup, or a SellSetup after a failed BuySetup or a Setup after 2 LeggedMove close to a KeyLevel I don't want to discuss this setups... I am a Human therefore I cannot see and trade all this Setups simultaneously and in this Time I try to learn PA-Trading on a new more expirience Level It is not a simpe thing, but I am working on it Have a nice Weekend atb vvm

UK regs on crypto are very strict and we don't get enough leverage to make it worthwhile unfortunately. I had found one broker but after the FTX fiasco they have stopped accepting new trades.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
ye, spreads and leverage are too high for me as well, i just trade it on demo for practice... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #401 ---
yeah, I remember trying to scalp BTC a few years back. The spreads were a killer. Then the leverage went and I just closed the pair. It does piss me off to be honest. Regulators stop people who know what they are doing from using leverage properly yet banks are allowed to operate unsustainable business models and when the inevitable crisis comes, just get bailed out one way or another. Leverage is only dangerous in the wrong hands but in the right hands, along with compounding, it's a gift from God! Ha!

Al Brooks Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar The Technical Analysis of Price Action for the Serious Trader Trading Guidelines 8. All patterns fail, and the failures often fail, but a failed failure is a second entry in the original direction and has a high probability of success. atb vvm

--- 帖子 #403 ---
This is what I do with the failed engulfs. I've found this time and time again. Failed setups often give opps. The key, for me, is to find a setup that goes against structure. A really clear one and then just look for the failure. On scalping I do this quite a lot as well.

Nice one man. I saw the entry but couldn't take the trade as was going into a major zone. That reaction we saw at NY open was to the zone I was watching. I wasn't sure how big the pullback could be so had to wait. Then when the pullback was confirmed as over I couldn't find an entry long. It went too fast for me. Nice one though. Structure was nice on this.

NZDUSD H1 SOLD Chart attached. The H1 candle took liquidity right at supply and left a big wick. Classic sell signal. The leg up looks clean (all green candles up) which means price usually needs to pullback. The problem here was the range. The blue box is the clear range I can see. There is a zone there. Once it gets there I don't know what will happen so SL is pretty much at breakeven. Let's see.

Free trades are very powerful IMO. If structure and range is clear then leave the SL alone but otherwise just take it to less than 1R and leave it at breakeven.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) that is why trading is an ART vvm, not a science!

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Also why it's key to develop your own view. Because if you follow others then when shit hits the fan, you got nothing to lean on. Use other's theory but ALWAYS develop your own view. Losses are just feedback for the evolutionally process needed to succeed in this game. Therefore can be viewed as stepping stones to success. Perspective creates reality and how you frame things is a choice!

Hi there, new Day, new Luck! atb vvm

--- 帖子 #434 ---
mate, these entries! Do you use higher time frame zones or something? Everything is defined for me when I enter a trade! Now I see how you enter. But at what point what would you close all those longs? I honestly think if you just waited for a clear reversal pattern, your returns would be better. If you just focus on QM/H&amp;S reversals and look for failures as well it may lead to a better return for you. Yeah looks like it's breaking structure and going lower. HTF structure was clear on that trade. Yeah got 2 breakeven this morning on scalping. Then went to the gym only for the move I was waiting for, to hit! ha!

--- 帖子 #435 ---

EURUSD H1 Bought, closed by Hande +4 was too tricky........... s. Chart atb vvm

--- 帖子 #437 ---
not for entries, i'll use higher timeframes when looking for an exit if i'm stuck in a drawdown as i was yesterday for example, would you take this triple top entry purely based on what you see here as it formed and nothing else and what would you target if you did? if you go back and look at 1M chart tops and bottoms then you won't stop seeing them! Attached Image likewise with all other PA signals, pin bars, engulfments, you name it - i hope that makes it a bit clearer on how i enter trades, the best way to describe it is discretionary yes, entries are purely based on what i see in front of me on the 1M chart - i'll only close cost averaged positions as soon as they are as close to a small loss\breakeven\small profit stage at the earliest opportunity i believe you are right, but i do not have the patience, instead, if i'm in a trade and a clear sign appears, i will attempt to maximise my profits using that reversal signal really appreciate the feedback, good bad and ugly, so please feel free to keep it coming, i have very thick skin... AUDUSD 1M can't remember why i entered or what i was targeting! deep drawdown very quickly, no appetite for risk yesterday, so just let it run, lucky i was watching it, it just fell shy of targets and i closed manually - in a small profit by the way - just before calling it a day, had i left it i'd still be in deep drawdown now, managing these situations successfully requires much planning and practice and persistence and patience Attached Image (click to enlarge) anyway, back to today, a much better start... AUDUSD 1M no filter entry other than what i see in front of me - entered short on triple top a bit late targeting previous low Attached Image (click to enlarge) second entry, while i'm typing this, purely subjective anticipating another top, now a five top, surely can't go wrong now!

that's no problem, i think i get the idea and it didn't take long to cobble something together, hardest part will be the scaling for multiple timeframes - here i'm showing last 10 candles of M15 and M30 Attached Image (click to enlarge) it might be useful, i'll let you know how it goes, thanks for sharing... the scaling issue wasn't that difficult in the end, here are the last 15 bars of M5, H1 and D1, i feel like there might be some benefit in using this on the 1M chart for scalping - i'll add two more timeframes and start wrapping it up Attached Image (click to enlarge) almost there!

that's a contentious one vvm! i would argue there are MANY countertrend patterns with a very high probability - the simplest being a large overextension from a short term ema followed by a simple PA signal like double top\bottom or engulfment - i'm sure there are many examples in the trades i've posted...

Thanks, I'm the same as you. Def not a coder but over the years have managed to cobble some basic things together with the resources online. ChatGPT has been a GODSEND since it became live in December. I use it extensively for any basic coding I need to do. It's FAR from perfect but gives a good basic framework to built on.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
no problem - i prefer to write it myself rather than using a tool to generate it, it helps to build up a library over time that you can reuse, starting with some very basic templates that you just fill in yourself, anyway, i updated my original post with the latest snapshots, feel free to provide feedback, i'll start using it and get back to you on how useful i find it...

--- 帖子 #475 ---
looks amazing dude! well done! The other thing I would suggest is take a screenshot of all your entries. It gives you what the candles look like exactly at your entry. Helps with journaling to see how the candles finished. A lot of what I do is try and predict the next HTF candle using structure and what the LTF candles are doing.

hey vvm, these trades were affected by fundamental factors due to the interest rate news coming up for the AUD technically, i think for the first one, the wick wasn't long enough to trap the bulls, if it was higher like this it would of had a better chance Attached Image (click to enlarge) you did very well to anticipate the reversal and more importantly act on it to come out on top - good job!

Hi there, new Day new Luck atb vvm

--- 帖子 #483 ---
he niks, U are right I think now so too atb vvm

--- 帖子 #484 ---
It makes a lot of sense. It will take time to integrate fully so I would say don't rush it, just gather the observations over time. Would really recommend adding an auto screenshot in MQL5 on entry. You want to freeze them candles on entry then analyse after with your journaling process. On a HIGHLY simplistic basis just make sure the HTF candles are in the same direction as your trade and ignore any over-extension trades in the other direction. As you are following M1, you should see a lot inline with the HTFs. As you scalping M1, M5 would be useful dude. I scalp M5 and have M15-D1. For you, you should really have M5-D1, if you can manage to get all that on your charts. I'm really glad I could help! This indicator is just amazing for scalping, like I said before, I had been thinking of a way of representing this data on my chart for a long time. Never came across anything as good as this.

yes, certainly starting to feel its benefits, still gotta fix that LL bar bug though, haven't got around to it yet, and i'm going to compact it a bit more, then it will look complete and better in the screenshots i totally agree with your take on my trade as well, i've seen you take those trades at the perfect entry many times, i should take more notice of them, it paid off EXTREMELY well had it been taken! Attached Image (click to enlarge) i notice no mention of my first entry! i know it looks reckless, obviously not for me at the time, the PA signals were there, in hindsight it was, but it was based on the premise that AUD will retrace most of yesterdays move...

--- 帖子 #488 ---
ha yeah your first entry was madness ;-) Those kind of entries work when you have HUGE momentum like gold/GU yesterday. But those kind of market conditions are rare. It's much better to wait for a retrace to your long EMA and look for a zone to play off. ESP as we talking M1 here. This is all in my opinion!

--- 帖子 #489 ---
@Niks Perfect U pattern mate. You see how there are no left shoulders and it spends a long time basing before exploding back up? Also the whole thing is counter trend so this is perfect.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
very nice and well suited for a CT setup, never considered anything like this before, i certainly will now! appreciate your time in sharing it... this is how i'd probably enter and exit - enter after the breakout of the range and exit just below the start of the move, in this case, there was a nice ema to help guide the exit...

GBPNZD H1 SOLLLLLDDDD Big move up to take A LOT of liquidity. The first move down I wasn't convinced by so waited. The double top here was a classic. The second leg took out the high of the first which took all the stops of the guys who got the direction correct. After a BIG move like that, it looked good for short term reversals. I messed up my entry lot calcs which doesn't happen too often but which is why I have multiple positions. Risk is significantly reduced. The TP was the low but I needed a little more for my R:R of 1.5.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
@vvm - check this out one. I was thinking about it but was already in GN at the time and didn't want too much exposure, as hadn't seen anything on this strategy for a little while. I haven't seen any very basic H4/D1 EMA rejections that I like in quite a while either. But check out that zone, how many times it held price. Beautiful engulf entry after price comes back to demand.

still always better than a loss... vvm's new luck offering didn't stretch very far for me yesterday AUDUSD 1M long off support looking for trend continuation after a pullback targeting between ema50 and ema200 Attached Image (click to enlarge) then cost averaged two more orders at support levels as the pullback ran deeper than expected Attached Image (click to enlarge) the problem i faced with this trade was GREED - it was in a decent profit on two occasions but for very short period of time and both times i decided to wait for target after seeing ema200 approaching it and expecting price to touch it Attached Image (click to enlarge) the result was a runaway trade that had to be managed/monitored most of the day and required a bit of overtime to wrap it up! a fourth order was strategically placed to maintain a manageable break even level and no further orders were required as the retrace resumed back to break even once break even had been reached, it was also at a critical resistance level, i closed immediately after realising the resistance was not going to break - if it had broken, there would of been major profits so i waited right until the end before closing... Attached Image (click to enlarge) which upon reflection today, was timed to perfection! Attached Image so i had plenty of time to fix the LL bar bug and compact the timeframes on my indicator... now i may add in some configuration to choose timeframes and number of bars to display and whatever else might be useful...

This was a great trade mate. I really like it. I was looking at shorts but missed my entry. My full focus is on scalping and I was busy with that at the time.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Yeah the clean entries with zones to play off don't happen all the time. But if you wait for them, I'm confident you can increase your win rate! I appreciate win rate isn't paramount for all though. And yeah the ICT concepts are useful but I don't trade ICT. Their concept of liquidity and imbalance is something I use a lot in scalping. Your config looks amazing mate. I'm confident it will help you immensely. I would highly recommend building a screenshot feature in. MQL5 has a way of doing it in code. That way you can see all candles when you enter and can compare them to the close. For me personally, it helps A LOT. Have you seen the hedging post by the way? They use cost averaging and hedging to make really good profit. It's something I want to play with in the future but for now my main focus is just scalping. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...out-prediction I like the idea of not predicting. Check it out, if it's of interest to you.

@vvm - this was a valid trade. I tried to enter with a pending and it didn't hit unfortunately but this is what I meant previously. This EMA strategy is VERY simple. Strong trend + EMA rejection with wick on H4/D1. EMA14 + EMA200 must be aligned with good structure. It's VERY VERY simple.

hey vvm, my view on this one is strong trend on 1H chart might make the target difficult, it will need to break the trendline to reach the target Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #519 ---
you are correct thehusla - entering at the point of highest probability for profit is the key - for many, that involves waiting for price to reach an area in a certain way, the areas and price action i look for however are very primitive, i prefer to focus my attention on managing risk and dealing with drawdown - the profits are just the result of that development i scanned the hedging and averaging thread and hey, each to their own! not for me, but i understand the premise behind what they are doing, no one can predict the next tick for every tick but there are only two choices, that's for sure... part of that is why i prefer cost averaging, but will never get involved with hedging, for me it is additional risk that i'd prefer not to manage i'll look into the auto snapshot feature, looks simple enough, i'm thinking of adding an ema as well, thanks for the feedback...

that trend line was going to be hard to break, the dip to your target was caused by major impact news which is why it reversed so quickly - maybe watch it a bit more to try and get something out of it if it is still a free trade, ema200 is providing protection on the 1H chart and you can target a smaller dip - good luck!

Thanks for the chart. So with my EMA rejection strategy I try not to think too much. It's like wearing a different thinking cap for each strategy. The trades I post here are very different to my scalping trades as well. The point here is that not every week will be good for every strategy but with a few different strategies, there will always be good weeks on one strategy or the other. Just need to have different accounts for each strat. The EMA rejection is a long term strategy that takes VERY little time to trade. So on this one I just look for EMA rejection on higher time frame with a nice strong trend and I enter. I had a pending order and was hoping for a pullback overnight from Asia but it just continued dropping right away.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
yes i do BTC is crazy! i'd struggle to handle a live drawdown with it so i just use it for practice like you Attached Image (click to enlarge) for this one, i opened a long and short in middle of range with targets on either end, once one target was hit, the short in this case, i then cost averaged the long and lifted the target outside the range Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi bro, I look @ first to D1 There was a bullish 2 Bar Reversal Setup There was a bearish Bounce from 20MA and bullish Close above 8MA It were great Conditions for UpMove Todays Bar did trigger this BO in the morning already and then went down a bit H1 did show a possible UpMove after possible BO I placed my BuyStop here with a very small SL It took time but the Market did a correct Thing!!!! I am so lucky with this Trade atb vvm

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I'm glad it worked for you. I saw the same as you but in my opinion it was risky. We had HUGE red news where price normally spikes A LOT. Very easy for price to spike to the lower zone before going up. We didn't know that news would just take price higher before spiking lower. Also there was a clear zone to the upside holding price. There was no way for me to enter and cover the below zone with my SL so I thought it was too risky for me. My scenario was very likely in my opinion but this time news just took prices higher. For me, too much uncertainty and with news if I was wrong then also slippage.

thanks, could of gone either way as you know with big news events, just pick any USD pair and the same result, i too was expecting a spike both ways but it just shot straight up, worked out well for my demo trade and even better for vvm! yes, the price line is a useful addition clearly highlighting S&amp;R as the current bar approaches them on the higher TF's - it's slowly starting to fit in with my analysis...

--- 帖子 #566 ---
hi vvm, i have no idea about news either, but i do know it has a MAJOR impact on prices and knowing about it can help avoid many stop losses that then move onto take profit, this time you were lucky for sure... have a look at what just happened to the AUD straight after the new this morning - if you do not know about it, you can get stuck or suffer big loss, even if you have a stop loss, it is still dangerous, please be careful, it is worth to have a quick look every day at this page https://www.forexfactory.com Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The most important thing is it worked. So, am happy for you. If high impact news releases don't affect your strategy with breakout trades with tight stops then your experience is very different from mine. But we all make money! :-) Yeah I'm sure your winrate has improved already and it's only been a week! Happy I could help mate! I like these! nice trades and nice explanation! Next one for me. AUDCAD H1. Can see clear change in structure therefore it looks to me like it's trying to make another HH. It's a little risky as we are down on all HTFs but this one looked good enough to risk. Let's see.

After the initial push I put the SL to breakeven. I thought it was going to hit my SL but it didn't hit it and went to TP. 1.5R. 3/3 this week!

H4 EMA Rejection. Nothing more to this trade. This is a different strategy to my other trades posted on here which I trade on a separate account and haven't seen a valid trade in a while. That supply zone at the top is a little worrying but the trade fits the strategy. Strong trend + EMA rejection. Will see if the supply holds or not. The move down just looks like a D1 retrace.

my view for this trade - it was in an uptrend then a bigger than normal bullish candle formed which can indicate the end of a trend - then as it retraced, it broke the trend line, then a failed attempt to resume the trend and continued on down... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi there new Day new Luck, niks about Ur Post IMHO U are right about this Climax but TL BO is very weak Normally the Market try to make a Retest of the old Extreeme @ first makes new HH or new LH and then makes a new DownLeg or a new Correction But we have to think always mit Probability Terms, in this Fall has my Setup 60% to go Up and 40% to go Down The Market is the King and it went down

thank you for the explanation vvm, now i understand your logic and why you entered - unfortunately it went the other way this time...

AUDUSD 1M yesterdays post news trades ended with a small loss - mostly because i was undecided, but ultimately due to bad luck! in this sequence, i started BE after a big gap down, then stopped out for a loss trying to go long again, then went short and took a small win and then i tried to be smart, gotta stop doing that! i opened a short and long at the same time and set equal SL's either end hoping that one would hit and the other would run for profits - well the market was unkind and stopped both out before making the big move, a slightly higher SL would of done the trick, but wasn't to be this time...

hi vvm, hopefully you got to see how the markets react to high impact news, you will get used to it after a few times i just practiced with bitcoin over the weekend, it was very slow but i'm noticing it also respects support and resistance very well, so i play it both ways! BTCUSD 1H (DEMO) in the middle of a range i place buy and sell orders with targets on either end, once volume picks up like this morning, it can strike both ends! however, two of my buy orders suffered major slippage and ended in a loss, but overall, the pip haul was great, its a very risky pair to trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

After the last push there was no reason not to take profits so put the SL to +1.5R and left the TP at +3.5R. Price came down and took me out at 1.5R. 2/2 this week. Good luck this week so far

--- 帖子 #596 ---
that's a great start to the week! just looking at this one it appears it stopped you out at 1.5R before moving onto target, but it was very up and down and tough to call, so a positive result in the end is all that matters,,, Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #597 ---
haha yeah, just saw that. My 3.5R trades are rare and a lot of times they just reverse on me and end in breakeven with me wishing I had just taken 1.5R! So in this case after a MESSY day and a final push around NY close I thought it best to bank the 1.5R. Entry was good enough to leave it at B/E but you just never know mate. 3.5R is like winning two 1.5R in a row for me so it's real nice when it works.

nice, yes looks lucky to me too. Frustration is when expectations don't meet reality and reality is never the problem! I try my best to think in these terms as otherwise resulting negative emotional states tend to compound bad luck. I don't always succeed but try my best!

--- 帖子 #609 ---
the right luck always helps for sure... i just walk away now if a sequence ends up frustrating me and won't sit back down until i've completely forgotten about it... like this one for me this morning - was in a decent profit but still short of target and ended up BE - just have to walk away to wipe out all negative thoughts of missing out before moving onto the next one - as we all know, easier said than done! AUDUSD 1M entered long off support targeting ema50 just above minor resistance Attached Image (click to enlarge) it was looking good, so i lifted target, set BE stop, and was ready to close manually if it reached original target - well it just missed the original target - and i missed the PA telling me to close it, so ended up BE... Attached Image (click to enlarge) and now its stuck in this crappy range, so i really didn't miss much, that also helps to wipe a frustrating trade from memory, i just try and find the positives out of EVERY situation...

good to hear, staying sharp with another positive week! it was a tough end to the week with random moves so good effort, i ended the week with a couple of small losses and breakevens but still a positive week for me as well... Attached Image (click to enlarge) this was much the same as last friday for me, the problems occur when i start thinking about being stuck in a trade over the weekend which i avoid at all costs and end up cutting many trades short as a result, its just the way it is on a friday for me which is why i generally don't like trading in the last few hours of the week but when i get it right it can really end the week with a bang! all good just away from pc, vvm has been quiet, hope he's well too BTCUSD 1M (DEMO) short off resistance targeting previous level of support - cost averaged but missed the top for a third order, reached target as planned! Attached Image (click to enlarge) used volume analysis as well, simply identifying volume peaks with price drops Attached Image (click to enlarge) and now it formed a head and shoulders and the break appears to have failed, but it might be a failed failure!

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Cheers bro, there were quite a few random moves so happy with the results for the week. Glad to hear you finished positive too! If trading late on a Friday is a problem for you just don't do it. Have a rule where you stop trading 1-2 hours into NY session. Ultimately you just need to look at patterns in your losses and wins and then put steps in place to minimise them. Thinking over the long term is key. If end of session trades on a friday lead to a lot of losses but then one week you have some amazing luck then that one big win doesn't negate all the previous patterns in losses. Just got to look at stuff over the long term, sniff out patterns and adjust. This whole game is just a process of adaptation and evolution while testing our 'theories" in the market. Yes, I don't know why vvm is so quiet. I hope he's okay. Let's see what next week holds!

excellent advice as always thehusla! that was the second friday in a row now with the same result and i need to carefully reconsider my approach to end of week trading - my plan is to always avoid it, which i generally do - but that leads to a weakness which demo trading cannot strengthen. so looking back on it and after digesting what you have said, if i decide to pursue tackling the challenge of end of week trading, i'll do it with significantly smaller lot sizes, my goal is not to land a windfall profit, it is more about developing the positive mindset to trade during that time - thanks for the support... well, the week started with some robotic PA! i was not sure what to make of what i was seeing on the AUDUSD, for the last five minutes of the strange PA it was bouncing 10 PIPS with normal spread EVERY SECOND - WTF!!! can you make money from that??? Attached Image (click to enlarge) anyway, best of luck and hi to vvm

--- 帖子 #618 ---
No worries bro! This happens when there is no liquidity. If you look at highly illiquid assets the charts look like this. Best to stay away when you see that as will be huge spreads . To kick things off this week GU BOUGHT H1

--- 帖子 #619 ---
finished at breakeven

--- 帖子 #620 ---
that's the thing, in those last five mins spreads were reasonable only one and two pips, but price was up and down ~10 PIPS EVERY SECOND... maybe orders wouldn't get filled, if i was on pc, i might of tried to trade it on the demo, easy money if it works! anyway, looks like your trade almost reached target, hope it goes well...

XAUUSD H4 BOUGHT Bit of an unusual entry but Gold spikes the lows a lot so instead of entering on a retrace after an engulf I entered on price taking the low. Entry just got triggered, so let's see. A nice rally base rally demand zone entry.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Closed at breakeven. I wanted a spike to my entry and I could put it to breakeven but it's consolidating around my entry and that's not ideal. It's not really valid anymore.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Took one other trade yesterday which was a loss (a quick one so couldn't post) and missed a few valid trades. Wasn't my best day yesterday. Anywho, got this one last night. After the evening star I put a pending.

bugger, might of been one of them low spikes you mentioned that took you out unfortunately... Attached Image (click to enlarge) looks like your trigger was a retrace rather than hitting the low like your previous one which left more room to breathe to let you exit at BE, oh well, onto the next one, best of luck!

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Yeah this is the second time this scenario has happened to me in a few weeks. There was a demand zone below my SL. I missed it. It's like sods law! When i wait for another run of liquidity I miss the move and when I think the liquidity grabs are done I get my SL taken! Will make sure to review this over the weekend. Thanks!

EURUSD 1M trend continuation long cost averaging up at breakout levels and ema rejections the sequence starts with two shorts and two longs at ema200, then once a direction is decided, long in this case, the shorts are closed and the longs are added Attached Image (click to enlarge) then, as the trend is confirmed using ema's as a guide, more longs are added Attached Image (click to enlarge) then, as the trend picks up steam, price action is used to find an exit, in this case, larger than usual bars are the sign Attached Image (click to enlarge) then signs of a reversal trigger the exit!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) its a nice mix of PA, EMA's and common sense!

Beauty! no prediction, just following. Like this one. mate - I've moved over to the interactive traders chat. Just more people posting trades which is what I'm looking for with forum interaction. Your style makes sense but is just not for me. I don't know what's happened to vvm. I hope he's okay but will be posting there. It's a good mix of traders and styles which is ideal. Hope to see you there!

EURUSD 1M initial entries based on trend continuation long above ema200 which didn't hold, then the additional entries were based on a countertrend move to back above ema200 which would then continue the uptrend into the targets as it holds Attached Image (click to enlarge) using previous price action resistance as targets and will close manually if required well, looks like that got lucky!!! phew... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #638 ---
EURUSD 1M countertrend long targeting return to ema200 after impulsive move first traps the longs then traps the shorts to create the support zone that will hold price as it moves back to ema200 then a false breakout traps a new wave of shorts that contribute to my profits once the move above ema200 resumed - took a lot longer than i expected but it finally made it! Attached Image (click to enlarge) targets stopped following ema200 once they reached a suitable price action level due to the longevity of the trade

AUDUSD 1M long after overextension targeting around ema50, looked simple enough! Attached Image (click to enlarge) then again, feeling confident it will return... Attached Image (click to enlarge) which it did and offered a small profit, but my targets were higher and i didn't close manually - bad move, now i'm forced to either take a loss or continue managing the risk... Attached Image (click to enlarge) ended up adjusting targets and adding one more order which was all that was needed to end the week happy! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

BTCUSD 1M (DEMO) so went short after close of previous trade expecting a break below ema200 and targeted accordingly down to a support level - had to cost average two more positions after the uptrend had one last gasp trapping a whole bunch of longs providing the momentum needed to reach my target... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #643 ---
BTCUSD 1M (DEMO) now long again after rejection of breakout at support... Attached Image (click to enlarge) then cost average in one more order as more shorts get trapped, targeting a break above ema200 just below previous high to cover spread for a faster exit... Attached Image (click to enlarge) couldn't resist another order as more shorts are lured in expecting the downtrend to continue when the EMA's are suggesting otherwise... first was a breach of ema9, then a breach of ema20, then ema50, so next is ema200 once the faster ema's cross each other then break above ema200... Attached Image (click to enlarge) that's just the way it is! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

AUDUSD 1M after taking profits on the spike from the news i expected a retrace of the move so entered short targeting around ema200 with a higher than usual but reasonable target - no cost averaging was initially planned just in case the sentiment continued, in this case it did not... Attached Image (click to enlarge) and returned to profit after a small drawdown... Attached Image (click to enlarge) it was all on track and i was about to post this image with the smug comment "now just let the ema's do their magic!" Attached Image (click to enlarge) then, thinking it would be the right thing to do without really thinking, i set a BE sl on ema200 AT THE EXACT MINUTE that bar spiked up and took me out!!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) so of course its no surprise what happened next... Attached Image (click to enlarge) bugger, oh well, onto the next one!

--- 帖子 #648 ---
AUDUSD 1M long off support targeting break of ema200 just below previous high, the faster ema's crossing below ema200 suggested a weak downtrend, failure to break the support level confirmed it Attached Image (click to enlarge) then another entry as it attempt to push lower and fails Attached Image (click to enlarge) then it just scrapes my target and moves lower again after hitting resistance - now i anticipate a retest of support and bounce back up to target, so adjusted targets accordingly Attached Image (click to enlarge) as anticipated, it retested support and formed a double bottom which was reassuring, so i wan't too worried about this next downswing going too far Attached Image (click to enlarge) the downswing only retraced about 50% before bouncing back into target, closed manually due to price action just below modified target and just above original target for a nice profit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

AUDUSD 1M the reality of trading and learning to control emotions... not every trade goes to plan, like this one where i got greedy and took BE out of fear instead of taking profits earlier or letting it run, then, another opportunity presents itself as a new support level builds up and i failed to take it due to uncertainty as the bearish pressure was strong, only to see it reach potential targets!

Price Action and EMA's or MA's in general always tell a story and never lie - it just requires common sense to understand the story being told! much the same when learning to read a book as a youngster, at first we learn to pronounce the words but don't fully understand their meaning, the pictures are a lot easier to understand but don't tell the full story - so we are left guessing over time, as our reading abilities improve, the guesswork is reduced and then eventually eliminated to the point where we no longer guess what the words mean when reading a book and the pictures serve only as a supplement relying on indicators for trading signals is like reading just the pictures out of the book - a LOT of information is missing, and leads traders to believe that reading price action is too hard, or it's all guesswork! reading price action is hard and a lot of guesswork is required in the beginning, but over time, the guesswork is reduced then eliminated much like learning to read a book... that's my experience anyway...

Niks, Do you enter the market without stop loss? You are very brave.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
G'day porfirio, yes for the majority of my trades i use cost averaging instead of entering a stop loss, i will use them occasionally if trading the last few hours of the week, or when trying something new, sometimes i will enter buy and sell in middle of range and enter stop on either end and let the other end run, there are also times when i will close a trade in a loss manually and of course for break even and above protection - i only started doing this eight months ago and had some scary moments in the beginning but came out unscathed the inevitable consequences of this trading style are periods of drawdown and margin pressures and i continually work very hard on my risk and money management to make this easier every time it happens while trying to avoid it at all costs using what i have studied about trading naked price action for 15 years now... from the first day i started trading without stop loss was the first time i was consistently profitable on both demo and live accounts, before then i was running in circles for long time just to end up break even - but i will stress my live performance is no where near my demo performance and has a long way to go - this is why i clearly indicate my demo trades so when i look back i can remember - and to be honest, it does take a brave heart to trade this way as you can appreciate, whether or not its the right way for me only time will tell!!! i think you will find other threads with similar styles here at ff - or if your interested, you can look up King of Forex on yt to see where my motivation comes from... best of luck to you and thanks for your interest, i think anybody crazy enough to try and make money in forex is brave, or delusional!

Financial gain from a transaction or from a period of investment or business activity, usually calculated as income in excess of costs or as the final value of an asset in excess of its initial value. Advancement; improvement. that looks like an advantageous return to me amiraven! it's always great to see your shiny gold profits, thanks for posting - yes, i agree, seeing others make profits appears to have an effect on those that don't, unfortunately, rather than take the opportunity to try and learn, they will just spout nonsense... oh well, we just continue moving forward making consistent profits, keep up the hard work!

Hi Niks I just randomly found this thread, and you! Good to see you again, and of course kicking goals, making PROFITS. Here's my AU morning trades. I use MT4 so unfortunately it doesn't show the closed trades, but you can see the profits with your mind's eye, I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
likewise sonicvista, glad you found the thread and great to see you back again and trading well! that was some serious morning trading, good to see it ended in profit - was that top order just entered too early? anyway, you picked the right direction, a nice strong uptrend followed after your second snapshot... Attached Image (click to enlarge) i think there is a way to show trade history in mt4, i can dig up details if you're interested and can't find it... look forward to seeing more, best of luck to you!

--- 帖子 #796 ---
yes mate the top order was entered too early and all entries exited too early also. I am however getting better at holding/transitioning from counter-trend into trending phases, but this morning took so long to get moving I had other things to attend to so I got out with a handy profit not a big one. Still early on a Monday! Let's gooo!

it's actually built into mt4 but managed manually with no way that i can tell to auto update it with future trades, or you could use a script dedicated to the purpose, here is a useful thread - it has a script , or instructions for using the built in feature, whichever you prefer - i agree it is useful for sharing and for review especially after a loss, entries on their own mean very little, profit or loss can only be made on the exits!

This is what I am trying to improve on - I can do the reversal/countertrend trades back to the 200 EMA, no problem... and I can do the trend continuation leading off of the 200 EMA no problem... what I am trying to do is hold the trades for a continuation through the 200 EMA, if price action might support a measured move up, for example, in the chart here. The issue for me is trusting in the move and the evidence the candles are telling me... All part of the growing and improving process, which we will never perfect, so that's the fun of it, isn't it?! MantisClaw

--- 帖子 #804 ---
typically, once a trend has exhausted, price will return to ema200 and enter a range for a variable period of time, the measured move you are looking for occurs when it breaks out of that range starting a new trend in the direction of the breakout... that is also the time to manage risk and scale out for losses if you are on the wrong side of a countertrend trade... the way i do it is by trading the range around ema200, and once it breaks out after closing my last range trade, i look for trend continuation entries on pullbacks to ema's... my last set of shorts got caught out by the break of resistance and i was just lucky the news brought price back into profit, they were bad trades that should of been long and lucky they didn't lose... Attached Image (click to enlarge) so now just trying to catch some post news profits out of all that extra volume! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #805 ---
M1 EURUSD - that'll do! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #806 ---
yes, the typical price action is as you say, back to the 200 while distribution &amp; (re)accumulation occurs with ranging price action that we know so well... What I'm trying to challenge myself with is when price gets to an extreme high/low, well away from all the EMAs, and then the reversal is very strong, aggressive, clearly with institutional commitment, with the intent by the banks to go well beyond the current opposite range high/low. That's when price action treats the 200 EMA like it's not even there. (I hope that description helps better). I found an old chart that might show what I mean a little better - price works its way up, then moves down fast through the 200 EMA... that sort of thing. It's the 9 &amp; 20 EMAs that are 'more important' here, if that makes sense. MantisClaw

--- 帖子 #807 ---
it makes sense, i understand what you mean, and you are correct, it's the faster ema's that are more important to detect it... Attached Image (click to enlarge) in your example and the current one i have posted, the trend will start and the faster ema's will form parallel lines just before the break through ema200 - as each faster ema breaks ema200, if the trend is still strong with little sign of pullback once ema50 crosses ema200, then the trend is likely to continue and be strong... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) i do not do well with these trades, every time i think the trend is on, it's not!!!

--- 帖子 #808 ---
mate I agree with all you said, and thanks for verifying my thoughts about the 9 &amp; 20 EMAs. To me the 50 EMA seems the least important in KOF's strategies, hence why lately I've omitted it from my charts... Interesting, I suspect you're stronger on the countertrend trades, where I think my strength is the trend ones. We will have to tag team it on our trades!

--- 帖子 #809 ---
M1 EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) my pleasure sonicvista, i think ema50 has it's place, especially when following a strong trend... i am most definitely more comfortable with countertrend, like the trade above, i feel like it's going to start a trend, but i'm not confident enough to hold, i prefer to exit and re-enter on a pullback, look forward to your insights on how you follow the trend!

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Again, yes, the 50 EMA has its place, especially on deep pullbacks... my thinking there is that I know price is still above (or below) the 200 EMA, so the trend is still in place... but yes i've also got lots of screenshots of charts where price bounces off the 50 perfectly. regarding trends, the best way i do it is when all the EMAs are tightly wound together like in a rope, price has been accumulating, oscillating around the EMAs, then begins to ascend/descend, either slowly or quickly, doesn't matter which... i enter on the first convincing candle that has broken out, put the SL on the other side of the 200, and re-enter on each pullback into the zone between the 9 &amp; 20. if price pulls back beyond the 20 (into the zone between the 20 &amp; 50), i usually exit and wait to see if there are re-entry options. otherwise its a case of keeping adding on each pullback, building a strong profit bit by bit. it's amazing how many little mini/micro lots can add up to huge profits in one long run! MantisClaw

--- 帖子 #811 ---
M1 EURUSD - following the trend like a hack! having anticipated a trend, i re-entered on a pullback to ema9, and would of added orders if it pulled back to ema50 and beyond but it didn't in this case... Attached Image (click to enlarge) i then look for an exit on the next higher high again not being brave enough to hold - many times i look back and regret it! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #812 ---
yeah holding when price is pulling back, and you see your profits dwindling, "do I hold? do I exit?" is the constant dialogue i have with myself!

--- 帖子 #813 ---
M1 EURUSD - same deal as trade above... but this time it pulled back to ema50 so another order was added... Attached Image (click to enlarge) target was simply a higher high using the keltner channel and rsi as a guide... there was a nice ema200 bounce, but i missed the entry on it, dinner calls! oh well... Attached Image (click to enlarge) my answer always turns out to be exit, holding rarely works well, i tend to overthink for the right time to exit a running trend, leading to hesitation and getting it wrong, maybe one day that will change!

--- 帖子 #814 ---
yes, i have to agree that more often than not the trend turns out to be a fakeout followed by a strong reversal of some sort. True trends happen so rarely, so that is why we don't trust them when they do appear, so that's how the MMs screw us over again... but given that in forex, most moves which create an imbalance create a need to rebalance, most of our trading is done in ranges and using reversals strategies. So given that most of forex price action is rangebound, and given that the forex market is a consolidatory market, as opposed to the equities market which is a trending market, what we do best is trade countertrend, from extremes back to the 'mean', equilibrium, middle ground, whatever you want to call it...

GJ Countertrend trades - these charts show how you can be wrong about initial price direction but still make profits. While I didn't get the initial direction correct, by dollar cost averaging down lower I still made a good profit.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
For me, the biggest problem I've had is this - I know that moving averages do not influence or determine price movement - price movement is simply the imbalance created by buy &amp; sell limit &amp; market orders being triggered into the live market. So, why do these moving averages just seem to 'be in the right place' at the right time? How do I trust these moving averages to indicate price will act in a certain way? Maybe because price operates according to patterns, rhythms and phases that seem to repeat, creating recognizable tradeable setups... and I've been deep down in multiple rabbit holes learning about DOMs, orderflows, institutional commitment, ICT, SMCs, etc etc etc... and after all that, I decided I just wanted to turn up and trade with a reliable system. These EMAs (9 20 50 200) provide a recognizable structure, 'guard rails', that I can work with alongside my knowledge of candlestick patterns. But it was the 'trust' of these EMAs and their hints that for a long time I struggled with, in my typical 'overthinking it' mode... For what it's worth, I am finding that if I just trust that if I follow these EMAs, more than 50% of the time I make healthy profits, whereas if i distrust them and try to 'outsmart' the market, I lose out. MantisClaw

--- 帖子 #858 ---
thanks again for your kind words and support, learning to hold in these strong trends is the final step for me, and the toughest, at least i am now starting to get a feel for when they develop, a lot better than i was even a few months ago... cost averaging has numerous benefits, but it must be tightly coupled with price action to be effective, anyone entering orders blindly or according to some fixed rules will always face losses... good to see you still managed a profit out of a bad trade, it pays to remain objective and not let emotions take over! today is triple witching day, so who knows, it could get wild, better to trade with extreme caution! you will learn to trust the ema's once you trust the ema's! losing faith in them in search of "better" options and then moving back to them to only lose faith in them again will cause distrust in them... i have been down that path and it is disconcerting every time, sticking with the ema's feels most natural and produces best results when traded with patience and discipline!

If common sense is being used (and moving averages if you may, not my choice at all) the length should be appropriate to the chart timeframe. For instance if a H1 chart is plotted a MA length that would be appropriate would be 60 (or half cycle 30) and multiples thereof - 90, 120, 150, 180 etc. Just sayin'. Otherwise its just stick a wet finger in the air and pick one. Nothing magically about 20, 50, 100, 200 etc unless they also happen to line up with timeframe being traded.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
a Moving Average PERIOD, not length, is chosen to calculate a period of time regardless of timeframe, the values chosen are purely based on trader preference... a lower period, 9 or 10 or whatever for example, will provide faster signals, regardless of timeframe, a higher period, 100 or 200 or whatever for example, will provide slower signals, regardless of timeframe... your example makes the least sense, price will always bounce off every MA period, the MA follows price, no one ever claimed they were magical!!!

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Moving Averages Charles Dow started uncovering a few simple facts about how many trading days are available in the Stock Market and on the Daily Timeframe he acknowledged there are 200 trading days, so the 200 MA was established as the yearly measurement and at this time as a trend line. The 50 was later established as a mid-year and the 20 as the monthly moving average. They are average trend lines or guides to allow the trader to view the past data only. If you did your homework, you would see the Forex Market has 262 trading days per year BUT a lot of traders just use Mr. Dow's acknowledged moving average across all Markets which maybe in correct as this average calculation will change with each timeframe applied, especially within MT4.

That is one and the same. Length of lookback period. Of course the period, length, whatever is based on one's preference. Just saying if one is looking at, for example, a 5 minute chart makes sense to use a length of 12 (or multiples of 12) because 12 X 5 = 60 minutes = 1 hour. But whatever, what do I know.

SunTrader, I explained the reason for Moving Averages in post 864 above and they are all based on the Stock Market daily timeframe years ago. Now, you are correct as the Forex Market has more trading days than the stock market and the average value is different on the daily timeframe and will be less on the lower timeframes BUT as I said earlier, most Traders do NOT adjust for this simple factoid - the Forex Market.

EURJPY Countertrend trades this morning

--- 帖子 #879 ---
another nice countertrend trade, great work sonicvista! your entries started probably just a little bit too aggressively as price was heading up to resistance which if broken would of applied some pressure... i prefer to leave gaps between orders and generally larger ones as price moves adversely - your vip order at the top was very well picked, your initial targets aiming for ema200 seemed reasonable, but i guess price action told you otherwise!

--- 帖子 #880 ---
hello darwati, i do not plan to switch to just following trends, but i am working very hard on improving my trend following and combining it with my countertrend... of course you will remember the inspiration you provided to me when i started trading this way by highlighting the ability to catch a mini trend after a countertrend, that advice improved my profits significantly and still inspires me!!! thanks for dropping in and all the best of luck to you!

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Always ask yourself: what is your trading style? if you have the same answer for today, tomorrow, next week, next year and in the future.... then it is only a matter of time that you will achieve success in trading keep going niks, don't be influenced by others, maintain your beliefs, then what you believe in will grow and develop... of course it will lead you to your goals/dreams see u again in 2025 Good luck

--- 帖子 #882 ---
it's pedantic i know but they are not the same at all, they have completely different meanings... Simple Moving Average Formula. SMA (n) = (P 1 + P 2 + … + P n) / n. Where: n is the number of time periods, Pn is the price at period n. there are infinite combinations on how you could use a MA in trading, your example might make sense to you, but is completely illogical to me... and that's fine! i appreciate and understand what you are trying to convey, but that's not the way i look at or use MA's myself...

Fair enough. I hope you at least put them up on a chart before deciding they are not worth it for ... as you say as you use them. Also if length and period are not the same - what is length?

--- 帖子 #890 ---
i'm always open to ideas and am interested in yours, feel free to provide an example of how you would use them on a 1 minute chart, your rationale for choosing that period, and how it would provide greater benefit over any other arbitrary period... length is a measure of totality and is not used in the formula, a period is an interval as defined in the formula... that's my understanding anyway!

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Niks, I'm trying to study your entries, but I'm a bit confused. Sometimes it seems like the price is going heavily against your direction, but your still in the trades. So I'm wondering where do you put your stops? How wide, and what's your average RRR?

--- 帖子 #892 ---
that is correct mrfo, sometimes price does move heavily against my direction but i am still in the trade, i do not use stop losses, i will stop myself out when i feel no chance of recovery or if i'm forced to due to drawdown limits... my average rrr is terrible, generally around 0.30!

CHAPTER 8 - Trend Reversals page 179 the most reliable countertrend trade is countertrend to a pullback which is a small trend in the opposite direction of a major trend... Attached Image (click to enlarge) once the pullback trendline is broken, any small pullback to test this breakout is a great breakout pullback entry... Attached Image (click to enlarge) this entry is counter to the trend of the pullback, but in the direction of the major trend and will usually lead to at least a test of the major trend's extreme...

It was just a suggestion because as I said originally:- "If common sense is being used (and moving averages if you may, not my choice at all ) the length should be appropriate to the chart timeframe....." But note TradeStation software (which obviously has been around a loooong time) refers to:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) I believe so does almost all of the industry. But if it works, it works however it is referred to.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
software engineers are not mathematicians! they even changed the commonly used term "Shift" with "Displace", how many times have you heard the term Displace used in all of the industry?! the industry is not tradestation, the most widely used trading platforms and educational material use conventional terms Period(s) and Shift as far as i know... but it is really just terminology and doesn't matter because when applied in the formula it all means the same thing... Attached Image (click to enlarge) again, i understand exactly what you are suggesting, and just like moving averages are not your choice at all, your suggestion on how to use them is not my choice at all, but thanks anyway!

M1 EURUSD - managing risk in a tough trend! here, it becomes obvious i am fighting a tough trend! Attached Image (click to enlarge) in this case, my risk management level was the resistance above ema200, price action is watched very closely, the trading decisions made at this level vary significantly and is mostly dependant on the number of open positions at the time... one or two positions would allow me to let it run its course beyond that level seeking further opportunities... three or four positions would have me seriously considering taking a loss for this trade but might wait a little longer... five or more positions would definitely result in cutting the loss at any sign of continuation beyond this point... Attached Image (click to enlarge) every trade is unique and must be handled accordingly!

can i just point out theres 2 kinds o common sense == preferred n all encompassing the latter would tell u if the mix has too much speculation in it then its a poor choice to work with. the obvious eg for this one is treatin a chart as fact or !!delayed insight!! the former would tell u its gamblin n to stay clear of it to find a real source for ur money to work n be useful ppl luv testin things out in da good times. TRY testin in da bad times when real life spills over into ur trading views n actions n real life. THIS will tell u if ur usin common sense or not if u do a history check charts werent created so common man could trade they were a tool designed for fiscal structures to measure over n under valuations of cost, value and performance. ppl ask or spit at me !!WHY!! i make fun o ppl n charts === THIS is why. ppl read what they want to read but NOT whats really there. so ppl speculate to try n MAKE IT WORK. im not writin this to piss u off only to show the initial fault in the idea of usin charts to speculate if this helps great if not then oh well. i tried

--- 帖子 #966 ---
if a person follows the actual real life food chain of connectivity between organized entities (eg broker right up through liquidity levels n beyond) you end up at the government level and corporate levels entertwined. ofc this knowledge is of no value to gamblers as they wanna have fun n !!make money!! === or try to anyway. thats what separates person of a gamble interest from real auditors or investigators of the money or financial markets n beyond. people say speccy vs invstor but thats a highly inaccurate comparison to make. if u reread what i said here= charts have a purpose but there is the problem. theyre not for what ppl are pushed into doin with em. if u have all da instructions of what makes the chart look as it does, then u would see that a broker answers to someone, who answers to someone else, and so on right up to govt level in form of taxes, licenses, permits etc etc. when u do this it is now NOT about speculatin. speccys dont care bout this stuff bcoz they cant see how it gives em an !!edge!!. BUT if a person understands da world they inhabit, then speculation would be the LAST thing they want to be doin and in that, is the edge. its tangible, its consistent and it has always been there. to make it simple here == every entity i wrote is there to create gain. even a govt. speccys focus on buy sell etc. but an entity always has to conform to rules regulations and timely audits or taxation. once you stop focussin on speccy buy sell stuff you free up the chart to want to see when the liq offerers or brokers have to do their required activities. and how this lines up with other asset classes and timeliness of requirements. brokers !!offer!! swap positive rates n overlay their fees with !!chances!! to win bigger or more. this is why the fx industry now is just one big advertisement. speccys cant see this on chart bcoz theyre waitin for da !!trend!! to line up with pos swaps so they can !!trade!! it. not sure if this answers ur question but it can give u a way to look at a chart differently. if da industry says !!stops hunts!! or !!trend breakout!! or !!divergence!! or anythin else like this then u know ppl will repeat it til they convince emselves its real. never was n never will be. its just REALLY good marketing. anyway im sorry to da ppl who post here or da starter of this thread. didnt mean to appear to take over. someone asked n i replied. have fun
