Hi Everyone. I’ve been a long time lurker on FF and since I’ve finally reached some level of success in my trading I thought it would be a nice thing to share some of my findings with the rest of the community. The ideas of this system were given to me by my sisters’ long time ex, a former hedge fund tech who I happened to come across in a bar about a year ago. He told me that he’d been doing some research on correlated movements of currency pairs and that his former employers were making a killing in the forex market with strategies based on his work. I was a bit intrigued by the thought of creating a strategy which success was based, not on the direction of one pairs movement, but rather the correlation between two currency pairs. After doing some research of my own and reading up on a lot of the mathematical theories behind correlation trading I’ve managed to put together a strategy that has delivered some remarkable performance over the last couple of months. Last month I was up 34 % on my account with very few draw downs. The idea is quite simple and tries to mimic the so called pairs trading done on stocks by many major StatArb hedge funds. I look at two currency pairs that seem to have a correlated price movement in the past like for example EURJPY and GBPJPY (see chart 1). When the spread between the two pairs deviates from their past behavior I simply sell the over performer and buy the underperformer. In this case I would sell GBPJPY and buy EURJPY. This way I have isolated the success of my position to the spread between these two pairs and hedged out the risk of the market in general moving in either way. As long as the spread between the two pairs shrinks back to normal I’ll make money without regard to the market direction. I have found that exotic pairs like the Nordic countries SEK/NOK/DKK seem very good when using this strategy. But I’ve also had some great success with GBPJPY and EURJPY and I have recently been looking at pairs including oil, silver and gold which look very promising but I have yet to start trading these. The system can be used both for long term and short term trading depending on the amount of correlation between the pairs traded. If you have a look at the daily chart of GBPJPY vs. EURJPY (Chart 2) you can see that there have been some great opportunities over the last two years with long term trading these pairs. I hope that some of you will find this strategy useful and I will continue posting here with more information on the strategy. If you have questions I am happy to answer them or suggestions on how the strategy can be made even more profitable. Best of trading luck to all of you. /Zeusjoes

Hi! I've studied a strategy like this some time ago, but seems that you have to be very aware of the parameters you use to establish a normal spread and wider spread so you can take positions. If you can I'd like to know for you what is a regular spread for eurjpy and gbpjpy and the rules you use to enter and exit a trade and if you considered using much smaller time frames i.e. 5min when trading small spread pairs like eur/usd . Regards, Guilherme

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Can you explain more detailed what is spread betwen 2 pairs? I know what is spread.....but i don't know what is spread betwen 2 pairs.....

--- 帖子 #4 ---
What parms are you using in this? How do you balance the hedge? I'd be interested in seeing the math, only reason I've never cross-hedged like that is I can't find a setup that actually reduces my net risk.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
If you hedge GBPJPY with EURJPY or vice versa, you are in effect trading EUR/GBP

--- 帖子 #6 ---
and you pay more spread

--- 帖子 #7 ---
He may be taking either a long or short EUR/GBP position. We don't know. He hasn't given any details.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
please i will like to know wat u mean by the spread betwn d two currencies thanks

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I have one thought about the position size of the two orders. Seeing that GBPJPY have a daily range that is approximately 2x the size of EURJPY, is the position size of the EURJPY 2x the position size of the GBPJPY?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Right... volatility would be important. In balance it'd be a long eurgbp, which isn't exactly hedging, unless he's also short that. In the case the hedge value would be the difference between the actual pair and a virtual pair. That'd end up as arbitrage really, with 3x the cost of spread. Would really like to see the numbers there. Edit: Crunching the details I don't see how the above could pay off. So...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Looking back at this period (H1 TF) and what the close of the bar was we have these numbers for the pairs: Date Time GBPJPY EURJPY EURGBP 2008.05.05 09.00 208.18 162.84 0.7822 2008.05.06 10.00 205.82 162.34 0.7887 Difference (in pips) -236 -50 +65 So as you can see if you would have bought EURJPY and sold GBPJPY you would have won 186 pips. On the other hand buying EURGBP would have only giving you 65 pips. This means that buying 1 lot EURJPY and selling 1 lot GBPJPY is not the same as buying 1 lot EURGBP, although it would seem like that would be the case. EDIT: Looking at the tickvalue at the moment I see that the tickvalue for GBPJPY and EURJPY is about $9.55 while the tickvalue for EURGBP is $19.70 and I guess that is something that one has to take into account as well. But there's still a difference.

Hi Zeusjoes, I have heard of something similar used by a Forex managed fund using 2 or more correlated pairs but I am not sure whether this is the same. (FYI, that managed fund got blown out with a total lost of $8 million worth of funds). Since you mentioned using GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY as an example, it will be helpful if you can show us an example on what are the entries for each pair to enter and exit to illustrate your point. It can be something of the past as well. A chart will help too. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Goes to pair volatility, GBPJPY moves more than EURJPY, so assuming equal lot sizes yes this would be true. But in order to do a real hedge you'd need to adjust your lot size to volatility. What I don't get is how this method is any less risky than simply taking a single directional trade. In other words this isn't "market neutral" it's just a directional trade with higher spread costs. Unless there's something I'm missing...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
In his words he is waiting for them to go out sync, eg when they are not as correlated as they should be and on that he decides which pair to sell and which to buy thinking that they would get back to their correlated state. That is how I am understanding this, but I think we'll have to wait for him to come back and gives us more info.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
NowAndLater - this is how I get it as well. Traditionally, pairs-trading would work as follows; Continuous analysis - Find highly correlated assets: Do the correlation calcs. Check the Mataf site tables for initial ideas when dealing with FX. Aim for a correlation at &gt; 0.90. But not too high - this would only mean that "out-of-correlation" movements are too rare. Be careful with the sliding window size! Too old values would distort your model. Spot the oppertunity - When correlation changes in a drastic way: Wait until the "gap" is about to close. That is, the difference is on its way back to the "normal state". Go short / long on the two underlying Take profit based on previous calcs and assumptions. Restart - Recalculate correlation very often Depends on time frame... I started to build an EA out of this once but things came in between. Anyone else tried this "for real" and have charts/results? Perhaps I will try to find the code and have a look at it again during the weekend... Regards, Maki

As regards to market neutrality with these two pairs in specific - if we have a look at the two pairs we can see the correlation between the value of the EUR and the GBP. The two currencies tend to move close to each other since the economies are intertwined and the bank of England and the ECB both want to keep them close. Every now and then one of the two over performs but in the long run the ECB and BOE will have their say and correct the difference. (Simply put) What we want to do is play with this relationship, we use the JPY as a benchmark to measure the currencies against each other to make visable the spread between the two. The market neutrality in this case refers to 1) the value of the JPY does not matter 2) Since the GBP and the EUR are highly correlated they will eventually revert back to mean. So, if we make our trades when the differances are big we take little risk and have a good chance of a successful trade. I use this strategy also for stocks and futures but since this is a forex forum I will keep to this subject. Someone asked how I keep track of the spread. We'll acctually I have a second version of metatrader installed with a demo account. Everytime I recalibrate my pairs I simply take the two positions in the demo account. That way I can track the spread easily. You might be right that the same position can be created with a directional trade on EURGBP at lower spread costs. This is something I havent even considered so cheers for pointing that out. Either way the USD would be a cheeper benchmark currency.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Could you please go more into detail and perharps post some charts as well?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Total silence from the author.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
The problem is how to see that both are losing correlation. Is it possible to overlay to linecharts with MT4? And if the move away from each other you still don't know when they are going to close the gap.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I'm sorry for not replying in a while. Had a pretty bad breakup a couple of weeks ago but now I'm back on my feet. I realise now when reading my first post that it is a bit unclear. I have made a indicator that I think will help everyone who is interested to understand what I'm talking about. Will post it this weekend.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
cool. im interested in knowing how u actually work out the difference in correlation.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
http://www.forex-tsd.com/indicators-...html#post86804 best correlation indicator out there. Enables you to plott 2 charts in one window. And you can inverse EUR/USD and USD/CHF to get them to match each other.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks tjpld, havinga look at it now. looks complicated...lol

--- 帖子 #24 ---
how do you calibrate them to match? when you say inverse them do you mean make one positive and another negative? or are they both positive?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Just change s1correlation from + to -.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Waiting for the indicator this coming weekend.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
maybe this one could help? i found in another forum and i modifie an indic to better view

--- 帖子 #28 ---
It's basicly what I've posted but you don't get bar charts like with the forex tsd indicator and you don't get the current value of the other pair.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Simple, export price data to excel and use it to create a chart with the formula GBPJPY-EURJPY. Done.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Guys, I am also very interested in correlation/arbitrage/hedging systems. Actually, I have developed an EA that trades in similar manner. I can give you a link if you are interested to see our results (6 months of forward tests on demo and live). Do not want to post here because it is a commercial EA and might be considered as spam here. Let me know.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
not as simple as that. and surly it is more simple to load an indicator?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Alrite! This indicator is a good supplement to my MA system. It looks really interesting! Thanks to Zeusjoe for "the hedge" system, going to try this one out for sure! mvh DramaKing

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I am trading in a similar manner. But to have an optimal TP and SL we should be able to gather data off how big the out of correlation gaps on the different timeframes are ?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yeah... I think GBPUSD is moving faster than EURUSD, because GBP is worth more than EUR... EUR is 0,78 of GBP. But I don't know if you put ~0,78lot in GBPUSD against 1lot in EURUSD would be right tho mvh DramaKing

--- 帖子 #35 ---
GBP is moving faster not only because is worth more, there are another factors too - one of that is liquidity of pair. I did some research some time ago about pair traiding (not fx pair but two different equitis, futures etc). Pro often use normalized divergence of pairs. One calculate average of pair div (price), next calc average of div between this average (between avg and pairs price div) and divided it by standard deviation of it. This sound complicated but it isn't - I did it in Excel but it's easy to programm it. I attached some scans form book "The handbook of pairs trading" by Douglas S.Ehrman. Btw this is interesting book if one is interested in pair traiding. Regards, Andrew

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Very good strategy. Today already made some pips on EUR/USD and GBP/USD. No complicated and still slow indicators - it's the best way to trade. Just need some more time to test this strategy, but i already see potential. Zeusjoes, where are you?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
S.O.S zeusjoes !!!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Tgijs, what is you experiance in this metod?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Here's another way of taking advantage of non correlation on highly correlated pairs.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
In this case you don't take 2 jpposite orders? so how to choose on what pair open trade and in what direction? How can you predict which pair will chande direction to match another pair? In other words, when you buy GPB while EUR is downtranding GBP can go down to match EUR. Or i've missed something?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Could you please post your excel sheet , I am not good with formulas Thank you

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Its nothing more than divergence. Usually we trade divergence with a pair versus an indicator. In this case we are trading divergence between two closely correlated pairs. Theoretically, when one makes a high, so should the other. When one makes a low, so should the other. When they don't, you have a divergence. On a bullish divergence we buy the weaker pair. On a bearish divergence, we sell the stronger pair. I mistakenly put my arrows just the opposite of that, but you can see what I mean. As a trigger, on a bullish divergence you're looking to buy. You can use a bar who's H and L are higher than the previous bar. On a bearish divergence, sell on a bar who's H and L are lower than the previous bar. There is a bearinh divergence right now on GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY. 4H. EUR/JPY is the stronger. If it has a bar that's H and L are lower than the previous bar, it's a short trade. If GBP/JPY breaks 213.26 before this happens, the trades off. I don't know if this would work any better, or as well, as Zeusjoes idea, but its the same principal.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thks, for explanation. I'll try this?. Zeus sistem is some like arbitrage. it works when pairs move correlating but with differend range. You system is for non correlated periods of pairs moving.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
It means the same thing. In both cases the pairs aren't moving together as they normally do.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks a lot to Zeus for bringing up this idea. I indeed know many traders follow similar strategy and claim success. This thread may help us to contribute together to learn from Zeus and get this idea even better maybe. But there is nothing to cheer out for single direction trading, e.g. trade eurgbp. I have to say, it is completely different from the Zeus 2-pair trading. If someone trade EurGbp, just read that chart, act as normal trading. Recognizing the diverging 2-pair may reduce your risk to solely trading eurgbp. But trading eurgbp cannot replace 2-pair trading in the sense of lower risk, higher return. hope i made myself understood. after all, trading 2-pair is not same as solely trading the cross. last example, some always say that long eurusd + short gbpusd = long eurgbp. It seemingly true. but it is NOT. Especially when it come to xxxJPY. The pip difference may be huge.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I am trading this kind of method on live micro lots and so far it goes pretty well.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Could you explain step by step your trading? How do you choose time to enter and exit? How you determine target profit?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here's an example of what I was talking about yesterday on the hourly charts. E/J made a low. G/J did not. Buy the E/J. Actually you can buy either. I'm showing buying the weaker to keep with the concept of this thread.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
How you know that E/J is the weaker? Maybe G/J is the overbuy and in this case you will have to sell G/J not buy E/J. Sorry for my english...i hope you understand what i want to say......

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I know it's the weaker because I can see it on the chart. Look at the dip on E/J and the up move on G/J.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I get it. But the concept of this thread at start was how to try to hadge opening 2 positions same time. This week i did some trades on GBP/USD and EUR/USD. I open 2 orders at the same time and close both when total profit of 2 positions is 15 pips. Actually all my trades was in profit. The main problem is how clearly detemine time to enter and exit

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hello Free84 Firstly thanks for the sharing. I have downloaded the indicator but when i use it nothing happens to the chart. Can you please explain how to use it. Many thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
OK... here you go.... but the Delta on this one is only 70p, I might wait for more, but you get the idea... I might have an EA available at some point.. in develpment now with my programmer... not as easy as it looks!! mk

--- 帖子 #54 ---
guys, i'm saying it right here, right now. there is no guarantee the correlation will ever go back to zero.... in fact correlations can deteriorate without justification in my research, i took EURUSD and GBPUSD and calculated the exact lot sizes to neutralize movement as much as possible. I think it was like 0.5 GBPUSD for every 1.0 EURUSD. well even with the tightest correlations (you are betting that it will eventually come back to zero) it can go thousands of pips apart in either direction (otherwise you'd just counterbalance against the bias) the result was a less volatile EURGBP cross, but where's the advantage in that? just buy EURGBP when it goes down, and sell when it goes up? i don't think so....

--- 帖子 #55 ---
There is NO guarantee in Forex at all. In this system like in all ohers you must cut loss and let the profit run.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
did you just say, "get lucky" ?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
does anyone ever calculate how much the discrepancy between E/J and G/J? I try this method today and so far i got like 50 pip....it is quite big....

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Let' not lose sight of what we are trying to do with ANY system..... Put the odds in our favor. That is it. Of course there is no guarantee the the correlation will ever return to zero.. of course! But MOST of the time it does. In fact, a very high percentage of times it does. It can be back checked accurately, because this is just price action. So hence the approach. This is not your usual "correlation" or "carry" trade. The conventional approach is to zero out the risk, go with the swap. We do not want to zero out the risk! But we want to minimize it, or slow it down. That same un-correlation that is our risk, also provide us our profits. Well said above, limit your risk. Yes. If 99 times out of 100 the correlation (as seen visably on the indicator) returns to zero after extending to say, 90... then if you take the trade, as noted above, you will gain your pips those 99 times... (if you can weather it going further out of correlation before it zeros.) And there is the rub! That one time that maybe it DOES go thousands of pips out of correltion, are we going to ride it? Not me. So when do we bail and accept the loss. That is trading. That is your call. For me, and the percentages (probabiliites) I am seeing in this price action, I'll trade the 90 spread, and go with maybe a 200 or 250p SL. So I am out before it takes off for it's thousand pip uncorrelated run... but that's just me. Then, reset your correlation from there and move ahead. Oh, and trading opposing sides of GBPUSD and EURUSD is not the same as trading the EURGBP. Just take a few trades of each at the same time and see the results. Probabilities, that's all we have. Cut your losses, take your profits when they come. We'll be OK.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Made another 15 pips today. I try to use this system on 15 min tf

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Denzil, Can you please show us a chart on this? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Also another thing, how many pips must one pair move in order to call it 'off' correlation?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hello! When i try to use OverLayChart -Point.mq4 i have the following error: zero divide. I have Ibfx with miniaccount demo. Anyone can help me? I saw on the others that indicator work.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Maybe one thing... I think on IBFX your mini account symbol is GBPUSDm.... would that make a difference?? I use FXDD, and the symbols are just GBPUSD format, and the indicator works fine.... As to how much "un-correlation" to trade... it's dependent on the time frame and the pair's history. Look back at a given setup, at your chosen time frame and see how far apart they get, and go from there. Be sure to set a MaxLoss as well, or you could get hurt REALLY bad if they go out of correlation hundreds of pips, which can and DOES happen. But then, they will "re-correlate" and you can trade again at the new equilibrium. The key is to limit your loss, get out at a reasonable level, and wait for the market to re-establish itself.. With Chart below, I used a 15m time frame. Don't know if this was a good Delta or not, I don't trade the 15m... but going back on the chart with the indicator will give you an idea. So just for the example part, The left red line is the point in time at the candle close you have a Delta of 13 pips. (Sounds too low to me, but for the example...) at 01:45. You would have sold the GU at 9927 and Bought the EU at 5748. (Points 1 and 2) Then, the lines cross (or zero) at sometime just before 02:45 (right red line, Point 3). (If you were watching this in realtime, you would see when they touch and could close your positions just then, but since we are looking back, I will use the close values of the 0245 candle.) So, close at GU= 9926, for a 1p profit... and the EU at 5760 for a 12p profit, total of 13 pips LESS your TWO spreads ... so not many pips profit, but you get the idea. Shorter time frames yield smaller gains, but you would have smaller MaxLoss risk as well, and could possibly trade more often. the 1 hr time frame shoots for maybe a 90p delta, making about 90p in profit, but running a MaxLoss of 150 or so... (allowing for a total of 240p of un-correlation... )... Sort of how I look at it...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
If that is the OverlayChart-Point indicator, I've noticed that it repaints. As the chart progresses in real time, the past overlay shifts up or down. You can't look at past history on the chart and determine anything. When what you are looking at was current, it may have been aligned totally differently. It's easy to see it repainting if you put it on a 1M TF.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I think that this best can be avoided by using a starting date Time in the past instead of number of Grids or Bars.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks mrkam. I changed indicator settings from USDCHF in USDCHFm and work fine. Thank you, and sorry for my english.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Good point!! and Yes, is is a "repainter"... but from what I have seen, not significant for how I use it... Pretty much, I just want to know the past 30 days, how far apart, on the hourly, plus or minus 10pips.. Do they get 50, 100, 150p apart? How many times? stuff like that. Pretty much just to get a "feel" for price action movement.... I'll have to check that starting date idea?? Is that a setting in the indicator, or a revision you made to the code??

--- 帖子 #68 ---
The things you want to see is exactly what it won't show. Put it on a 1M TF and you'll see what I mean. For example, I have seen the overlay be well above the price. The next bar it will completely shift to below the price. I don't know what, if anything, you can see by looking back on a chart.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
As for me, i take each day open price as a start point and look how many pips each pair makes from this point. On 15 min TF i place 2 orders when difference is greater then 20 pips. Then i set EA which close positions when profit is 15 pips.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
1. I think there is a lot better way to trade these pairs than using a hedge. I think the hedge wastes profits. 2. If you're going to use a hedge,ZeusJoes' suggestion seems to work better than any indicator I've seen. He said to use a demo platform and open up one position each on the two pairs, at the same time. You can watch the "profit" column to see disparity. I've played with three or four trades that way and have made profit on all of them. It may just be luck. I don't know. Open up two longs (or shorts, it doesn't matter), one on each pair. When the profit or loss on one of the pairs greatly exceeds the other, then hedge in the opposite direction. Example- Open a long GBP/JPY and a long EUR/JPY. Let's say that an hour later the G/J is - 600 and the E/J is -100. Either the G/J is TOO low or the E/J is TOO high or both. On your trading platform open a Long G/J and a short E/J. Close them when you have the desired profit. Most of the the times I have done this and made a profit, the indicator was giving the opposite signal. I don't trust the indicator. This isn't a complete system. It has to be determined how much of a disparity is enough to trade. How much profit do we close them on? When do we close them if they go against us?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Most of people waste all account trading one pair Or you have super system?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
If you think this hedge is any safer than trading a single pair, you are deluding yourself.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
As you sad it's not a system. There is no particular rules. I try to use it different ways by now, and maybe i'll get some iteresting results. Who knows... What is you favorite system at this moment? I'll be glad to know

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I use a daily system- have been for a few years. It's a commercial system and I can't post it. It's been in a drawdown for a few weeks and just took off again a few days ago.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
It's your commercial system or not? You can PM link to me if you whant. May be i'll be interested in it too. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
For some reason the 1hr is not near as volatile as the 1m.... agreed...stay away from using the 1m!! But the one hour is comparatively pretty stable. We all have the same questions.. and all we are trying to do is get on the right side of probabilities.... Entry: When? at what price divergence? (the original method uses the raw data, chart vs. chart. Others use indicators base on calculations to the second currency, all in an attempt to show price action against the base chart....) MaxLoss: How Much? (enough to let the trade develop, not too much to take excessive losses...). THIS PART IS NECESSARY, or will blow accounts at some point. Ask FreedomRocks people!! Exit: When? specific profit? at some sort of "zero point"? All good questions, and all part of developing a system. Using the one hour has been solid for me for almost a month now. Anywhere from 50-90p a trade, and the indicator works just fine... BUT! I use very specific MaxLoss (have an EA that tracks the net profit of two positions, and will close at a specific loss, or a specific profit. I use both to cover both sides of the trade.) This might be more appropriately called a "semi-hedge", and as correctly stated, it is NOT inherently "safer" than a single position. Again, all probabilities, but "usually" it moves more slowly and not as far either against us, or for us. Just a different trade to manage, in a different way. And great discussion!!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I wouldn't trade on 1M, but with a repainting indicator, the 1M speeds up the action so you don't have to watch it as long to prove it repaints. A repainter, repaints as bars are added, on the 1H TF you have to wait an hour for a new bar. I don't believe there is any way this indicator is more stable on 1H than it is on 1M. An indicator is either programed to allow repainting, or it is not. It just takes longer screen time to see it on 1H and it appears to be more stable. I'm not saying the indicator won't work if you are basing trades on it's present position (although I have my doubts), all I'm saying is that looking back on a chart, it's impossible to tell how the indicator really looked in the past. It repaints the past.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi mrkam! What distance do you use on 1H to enter and what is you target profit and target loss?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
OK, last post on this one... but here you go 1. Regarding repainting. I have seen the 1m move, and I have seen the 1H move, but only once, and only within the first few ticks. I don't know why. But once you set it up, and let it run, the past info IS valid. Seems like you have to keep the zoom level the same, or else things will change... I use one zoom less than max.... I know,... seems like a pain, too much to keep the same, but if you do, it works... But don't believe me. Do this. (I have). Each hour, record the close value of the main chart (line). Record the Value3 of the indicator. Start with the closest past closed bar, and record that closed bar along with every proceeding closed bar. You will see that the values remain the same. That is, it does not repaint, that is, it is accurate. that's all on that. 2. Here is a trade for today. I took it because of the big delta after a pretty flat time. Easy 48p, in 3 hrs, after spreads.... Great example of what this is... The GU takes off up, while the EU stays down, then the EU takes off up to catch up, eventually hitting the GU... that is what we are doing here, playing the time lag give and take between two pretty dang correlated (over time) currencies... Delta at close of 1000 was points 1 &amp; 2 (delta 62). GU was above the EU, so Sell GU, Buy EU. Closed at cross, point 3. Since we are dealing with closes, you can look at the charts and get your values. GU was -2, EU was +56, net +54 less 6p for both spreads, +48 in the bank. I am working on an EA that will open automatically at a set Delta, not wait for close. It will also close at whatever Delta you set, for me, zero. But it is still in development. So, for now, I have an EA that will close all positions at a set profit or loss level in pips. So i set it up on two charts, one at my set profit, one at my set loss. For the GU/EU, I usually look for a delta of 90p. I took this one at less because of the recent price action. I usually set the Maxloss EA at 2X the Delta. Here, at delta 62, I set at -124p. Since the two pairs are already at 62 p uncorrelated, they would have to get to 186p uncorrelated to hit my MaxLoss. Fine. I am willing to risk that because 1) it is rare (based on back checking price action, hasn't hit 2x in over a year...) and 2), (as BillSS has stated, the two pairs WILL go hundreds of pips out.. at some point, but very very rare.. so, we NEED to get out if this happens...). OK.. rambling, but like I said, last post here.... So, I set the MaxLoss EA at 2X the delta, and the profit EA at the delta less spread... in this case 62-6, or 56... which hit, plus or minus a couple of pips for closing... I know BillSS says the indicator I use is worthless, but I have documented otherwise. (and at over 1700 posts, I am not going to argue! But to be true, I am right up there, different forum, but that is neither here nor there...!!) It is tedious, but do the work youself. You HAVE to verify any system yourself. Don't believe me, or anybody. Record each close and each value3 for every hour starting now... you will see if it changes. Give it an hour or two to settle first. Don't know why, but this seems to make a difference. I use a virtual server, so my trading platform is on 24/7, undisturbed. You CAN use the past info. Check the indicator with actual charts, using closes. Check as far back as you want, same process as above. Check at the larger deltas, check at the crosses, do the math... it works. Based on doing this,... the GU.EU hit 8 trade in June at 90 delta. Those 8 all closed at delta zero for a total of 750p (less 48p spread...). Max unrealized DD for any open trade was -90p. Not once in June hit a loss. This is not rocket science. Simple price action of two currency pairs, with an indicator to show entry &amp; exit. Good success to all. Hope this helps, but this discussion seems to be going in circles, meaning what can be said has been said (so far!!).. Bye.

Here are two screen shots of the indicator at work on the 1H chart. The first one was made last night before I went to bed. The second one was made this morning. The computer and platform had been left on all night. When the first one was made, the indicator had been in place for 5 or 6 hours. It was not finding its footing or whatever it has to do. The yellow vertical line marked a peak that had been made by the indicator. The price had shifted, overnight, upward by 38 pips. The white arrows on the charts, are pointing at a cluster of bars, where the shift is very easy to see. Originally, the indicator had been in the middle of these bars or below. Overnight it had shifted well above them. Again, this shift was in the neighborhood of 30 - 40 pips. You can visually scan both charts and see that the past indicator array has risen with time and/or price. If you have painstakingly documented and proven that this indicator does not repaint, then we are looking at two different indicators, which we may be. The one in these screenshots repaints with a vengeance. The one I used was dowloaded from post #27 on this thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...8&amp;postcount=27 I have not modified it. I am not a programmer and wouldn't know how to modify it if I wanted to. PS- I just checked and the indicator array has risen another 19 pips since I made the last screenshot.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I believe I have observed the reason this indicator repaints. If you notice, its highest point on the chart is always about 1 1/2" below the very top of the chart. The Lowest point of the indicator is the same distance above the bottom of the chart. The 1 1/2 may vary depending on the size of your monitor. Anyway, it keeps itself centered on the screen with equal margins on top and bottom. As new price fills the screen, it has to readjust to maintain its justification. The indicator points between the H and L are adjusted proportionally. It does this repositioning, without regard to the price bars which share the chart with the indicator. Check it out and you'll see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I have modified the indicator with 2 extra parameters: starting time and TF period. Haven't tested it yet, but it seems to work. The time parameter is the usual MT4 method: yyyy.mm.dd hh:mm The TF period is default at 1 Hr TF = 60 Repainting should be over now, but as I said, haven't tested it yet.

Hi SwingMan, thanks for the indicators. I'm starting today testing this system on a demo account. It's about an hour before NFP release today, so we will see what a volitile day will do for the system now. If someone could comment on this and see if I have everything set up right I would appreciate it. Right now it's down a bit but that may be normal for this. We will see. Pic #1 is the EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs. Pic #2 is the EUR/USD and USD/CHF pairs. Thanks for the help.

Good call on the repainting!! I had manually compressed my chart (by dragging the right scale) so that the chart never had to re-center... so it appeared OK for me..???. The Oscillator is a nice indicator! good job.. is there a way to set it up to show more bars? If I set the start date in the past, it only shows 24 bars, wherever you put it... would be nice to show a month back on the hourly, somewhere around 500 bars back??

--- 帖子 #101 ---
This is a big problem! If you give for StartingTimeCorr an other date as our "2008.07.01 00:00", you can see more bars, BUT the range values changes! The algorithm from the original "OverLay Chart" indicator is very nice, but is functioning only on the current window. I just try to find an other algorithm with a moving time-window, but the solution is not easy... Here my first attempt: .

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Try this modification, which paints the bars back about a month now...: (I used the "old" v2, because I don't have the mq4 for v3, but the modification is very easy.....) If we use v3... .then it would calculate the threshold based on 500 bars, which would be GREAT!!! //-- Calculate Visible Bars _BarsCount = WindowBarsPerChart() + 500 ; int _FirstBar = firstBar; // WindowFirstVisibleBar(); int _LastBar = _FirstBar - _BarsCount + 500 ; if ( _LastBar &lt; 0 ) { _LastBar = 0; _BarsCount = _FirstBar + 500 ; } Looks like we still have to input the start date, but it really is "now" then works back... can we just leave it be the current time, no input??

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Here the Version 3.1 for you. The problem is that for trading decision today, you calculate the range from today. After x days you have for today an other range as today (is clear...?). The value what you see in the oscillator 5 days ago (e.g. 100), was 5 days ago maybe 80 or maybe 110! The chart and the oscillator works with the position of the close between the HiLo bands. For short periods (50-60 bars, e.g. 2-3 days) you can use the range values for trading, but for larger periods (&gt;100) the range values are unrealistic.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Can you please post (or PN) the 8 entry times in June? I will check if with the version 4 is possible to find (historical) the same entrys. If not, I must find an other solution.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I had good results on Thursday, which was a NFP day (released early due to holiday.) It may have been luck, I don't know. But I did trade by the rules and am up some on my account. So far today (Friday) the market is flat and I don't expect much more movement with the US markets on holiday. I'll hold all open positions over the long weekend and see what happens on Monday unless the spreads reach 0 before the market closes today. I'm also playing with the MM and the stops on this since I don't have a clue how far the spreads can go against you. It's going to take some time to learn. Who knows, I may blow out my account because I'm doing this all wrong. I'll let you know. That's why I'm using a demo. I plan to just watch and see how these spreads work out before I enter any more trades on other pairs so I can keep from getting the results all mixed up together. I'll keep you posted.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I was wondering if it is more useful to set the mirroring on the indicators to "true" or "false" or does it make any difference? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks! SwingMan... I know what you mean about the threshold determination over time... But it is great to be able to paint back a month, see where the extremes were, and set a threshold with our good ol' brains!! One question though... Looks like we will have to daily update the StartTimeCorr entry.. If I set this at say, 2008/6/5, the indicater will start at about 6/10 and paint BACK... set at 6/30, the indicator stops at 7/3,. So at a 7/1 setting, I figure it will work until about 7/6 and then not paint any current bars... meaning we would have to reset the date then?? Is there a way to have that value pick up the current date/time, thereby always updating itself? And we don't need that input? Would that mess up the calc? Doesn't appear to.. If I set it at 7/4 or 7/1, the indicator looks the same, and accurate... Very nice work!! And Pistol Dave.... sort of depends on you, and how you like to "see" the relationship between the two pairs. Having the setting allows us to setup the indicator (either one) to show us what we like to see for either positively correlated pairs (GU/EU) or negatively correlated pairs (EU/EChf)...

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hello Swingman, I am impressed with your work. Do you think a fully automatic ea could be developed from the indicators? Jeff

--- 帖子 #109 ---
sorry if this a stupid question. but while the line made by mrkam (EU) was close of GU since the ende of the day the oscilator was showing the correlation as super oversold. i suppose the oscilator was wrong, is it? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
To better use our brains, is possible to give two dates (begin/end), and to draw the prices for this period. Then can you the "what if" back analyse. My idea to "updating itself" the begin of the calculation period is to give as parameter "2-3 days back". With this input we have ranges that not changes every hour.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I think there are some minor calculation errors, but you can test the new indicators. I'm going (The old v3 indicator has also a small error in the calculation of the threshold). .

--- 帖子 #113 ---
A few small changes in the indicators. - If the main chart is GBPUSD or EURUSD, the appropriate SubSymbols EURUSD and USDCHF and the Mirroring parameter are set automatically. For other SubSymbols you must enter this symbols. .

Wanted to give everyone a report on the results I had from last week's trading this strategy. I am going to try to trade the system as well as I can, by the rules that I understand so far. I'll do it as long as there is some hope that it is profitable. I will try to report after the end of each trading week. Keep in mind that I have a job where I may not be able to enter/exit every trade at the best possible times. So how well I do may not be as good as a full time trader could do with this. I'll do my best to take only trades that go by the best rules we can come up with. I hope everyone keeps sharing their results, charts, ideas, so we can see what works best. A good EA would be nice too. I started out trading on the 1h timeframe and I'll keep using that unless I see it's not going to work for me and I may try others. I'm setting stops at 130 pips on each pair and using mini-lots on each pair (0.1 lot). Beginning balance: Opened Demo with $1000 on July 03 2008 Since I opened the account late in the week I'm going to use this amount as the Beginning week balance for the week June 30 - July 4. Beginning week balance: $1000 Ending week balance: $1508 I realize that this is an exceptional result and it was only due to the NFP release. And I probably was using way too much leverage. But over a month or two of testing the results should even out to a more normal variation. Or I may blow out, who knows. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Only one idea for the analysis of entrys: Take the trades if 1. Setup HedgeRange &gt; Threshold 2. Confirmation Parabolic condition or LWMA Close(5) cross the LWMA Open(8) condition If one look at the historical HedgeRatios (osc_v4), I believe that we can avoid large drawdowns. .

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Which pairs?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi SwingMan, Thanks for doing the research on the indicators. Looks good. I'm still using the osc_v2 but I'm going to try osc_v4 and see how it works. I think I tried osc_v3 and had some problems with it. The pairs I had success with are: GBP/JPY - EUR/JPY EUR/USD - USD/CHF GBP/USD - EUR/USD I'm posting this screenshot of that days trading so you can see the entry times, etc.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
The last version for the NeutralHedge indicators: - The threshold is calculated as middle of the HedgeRanges + Factor * StdDev. The indicators takes as default value Factor_Threshold=0.0, and you can test other values. - If you enter the Last_OverlayTime (e.g. 2008.07.02 20:00), you have in the Overlay indicator and in the Oscillator 3.2 the historical analysis at this time. (In the Oscillator v4.2 you have automatically the HedgeRange and the Threshold values as Histogram and Points). - The Overlay indicator draw also the ranged prices of the SubSymbol from the last overlay time to the current time (dot line). - If you enter the Trade_EntryTime (e.g. 2008.07.02 20:00), and not forget(!) to enter the OrderType (Buy=0, Sell=1), you have the current result of the trade. Also you have the maximum Win between! - The default value for the calculation of the HedgeRanges is set at 72 (3 days x 24 hours = 72 bars). - For four pairs in the main chart, the indicators take automatically the SubSymbols and set the Mirroring parameter: GBPUSD - EURUSD, true GBPJPY - EURJPY, true EURUSD - USDCHF, false USDJPY - AUDUSD, false Remark: is possible that the indicators repaints, but now at the weekend can I not find this. As example, a study for the USDJPY / AUDUSD pairs in the H4 time frame: .

SwingMan, I can see you have been hard at work here. It looks great. The indicators are going to be very helpful. It looks like you have been able to determine a high probability entry level with the NeutralHedge indicators. The psar should also help to tell when the price begins to swing back toward correlation/non-correlation so that would be a high probability entry point. I don't know yet if we would be giving up too much profit by using a lagging indicator like a MA for entry though. We will see. All that makes sense to me so far. (But it will still take some time in real trading to see if it works out.) I'm excited that you have made this much progress. And I hope I am understanding all this properly. One other important aspect to consider is the exit of the trades. For my exits, I used the original idea that was suggested in one of the first posts where someone said they had been exiting when the spread (I think you are calling it the HedgeRange) goes back to zero. That's where I closed my positions and in this particular case it caused me to lose over 100 pips potential profit from the trades. By looking at the chart it's easy to see that I should have stayed in a lot longer. Obviously, where you exit will determine whether this system proves profitable or not over the long run. Do you think closing out at zero is the best way, or maybe there is something else we could look for to indicate that would let us know that the run is about over for that particular trade? The stops will definitely make a difference too. I was originally thinking around 100-150 pips. That sounds like too much, but because this method is so much different than anything else I have used I'm going to give it plenty of room to move until we see what is going to happen. We still have to see what the risk/reward is going to be. I'm open to hear any ideas you might have. BTW, I hope we can get some input from the other guys that were reading this thread earlier since I know some of them are some very sharp traders. Dave

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Just a stupid question How can attach the indicator and where about? I can not make it works thanks

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Yes, and now I'm waiting that also other guys do the same with further analysis! I must admit that it is not easy! This is one possibilty. The other is to exit if one is in the profit and the threshold value is reached. For such analyses I calculate the maxWin between entry and current time (osc3 or 4). In my example, you see that the maxWin was 126, the threshold was 129, and the spread at entry time (HedgeRange) was 205. I don't think that until the spread is zero, we win more as 130 pips (maybe yes, maybe no...). I hope the same! I'm not a trader. I'm just a simple programmer and I may develope an EA only if I receive input from the experts . I hope also that @mrkam can help us, he is the biggest NeutralHedge specialist!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
What's the reason to set the TF to 60?Can I set the TF at 30 instead of 60 for the 5,15,30min and 1hr chart? Also on the neutralhedge. Can alerts be set on the the overlay chart or the neutralhedge at a certain spread? Thanks for any info on this. P.S. Great work Swingman

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Bogul, I think you can set the TF to 30 or less and it will work. See post #63 where someone was using it. SwingMan might be able to put in an alert on the NeutralHedge indicator. I don't think it has one now. That would be a good idea. Dave

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi dtdoom, on post #118 are the latest indicators and template shown in the screenshot on that post. -- Install the indicators in metatrader4\experts\indicators folder. -- Install the template in metrader4\templates folder. -- Close and re-open your MT4 platform; and right click on a chart and select the template in the list in the drop-down menu. If you need to change some of the settings in the indicator you can find out more about that by reading the last 20-30 posts here and a lot of questions are answered about how to use it. I'm using NeutralHedge osc_v3 and OverlayChart-Point indicators which can be found on some of the earlier posts. Hope this answers your question, Dave

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Dave, what I mean is to change the TF to 30 from 60 within the indicators of the overlay chart and the neutralhedge indicator not just the TF of the charts. Is that what you are talking about? When I set it to 15 I cannot see the overlay or neutralhedge. On the 5 or 15 min chart, I can see a difference of a few pips when I switch from 60TF to 30TF on both the overlay and neutralhedge indicators. Is it okay to use it like this? Maybe mrkam can give his opinion also!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi All... to PistolDave's Query regarding Exits... Consider the following chart, or actually indicator... We don't really need the chart!!! Keep in mind we are not trading one pair, like usual, but the relationship between two pairs, somewhat correlated, as they move in and out of synchronicity. Think of it like a Pendulum... swings to one side, through Zero, to the other side, and back again, and so on.... On the chart below, I have noted 5 points in the "cycle" of this trading system, points A thru E. Barring a major de-correlation and subsequent re-establishing, (it happens, very rare, but it happens, which is why we have to have a maxLoss....), these are the points that EVERY trade will go through. We need only look at past history of price action to see. A: Initial Entry. I manually set the triggerDelta at 90, based on past movement, etc. At this point, I enter the Buy/Sell trade. B: The max drawdown point. (Also the point of maximum profit IFFF you can determine it ahead of time. As it is with any trend, you only know if it is at the top AFTER the fact.) At B, we are negative, but hopefully not to our MaxLoss point, so we are still in the Trade. C: Zero Point. This is where I exit. (will discuss below a bit more....) This is what I call the Conservative Exit. We are in, then out, waiting for the next trade entry signal, (Point D)... D: New Trade Entry at opposite side, or a Sell/Buy entry. THIS IS ALSO THE POINT OF MAXIMUM (PRACTICAL) PROFIT FOR THE TRADE CYCLE!!! (I say "Practical" because the actual maximum is from points B ot E, but we will never get those...) As I mentioned above, I get out at C, which is Conservative. The D Exit is Aggressive. You will have squeezed your max profit out of your chosen Deltas (or thresholds) at this point. You can see it is roughly 2X my Conservative Exit. Trading the Aggressive Exit makes this an ALWAYS IN, Stop &amp; Reverse system. You ALWAYS are carrying two positions, you just switch them back and forth with the Cycle. E: Point of MaxDD for the opposite trade, or the next trade cycle, similar to Point B. We start the Cycle over again. If you look back in history, EVERY trade, in this method, goes through this cycle. The Conservative approach goes through A-C, and the Agressive Approach is A-D. Maybe we call this the PipsPendulum!! Offered for your consideration and comment.....

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks dave for your help. I installed all indicator but I think I m more confused with all this indicator. Also the inputs.. I don't get it Rmkam , I like your style, looks easier. How you get those chart thanks

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thank you very much, mrkam. Your explanation sheds new light on exactly what we need to do to profit from this concept. I can see you have a knack for making it clear and simple what needs to be done. And I'm liking this trading strategy more all the time. It does seem to have a lot of potential. I have a couple of other questions for you, if you would be so kind: 1 -- Is there any reasonable way to determine when the "pendulum" has run out of steam and is about ready to start back the other way? (I think that was what SwingMan was looking for when he added the psar to the chart.) Also, I was reading in the arb.pdf instruction document at the beginning of the thread where someone said about the trade setups (the one he was using at the time) " you should be able to determine within a few hours this is going to occur by plotting EURCHF with an ATR indicator. When the ATR is flat you will be able to make your trade within a few hours.." I assume that he was thinking about how to predict a turning point so that you would know when to enter/exit. I tried putting the ATR indicator on the chart but I can't say that it seems to predict much, except maybe the changes in correlation seem to occur more often when the ATR is rising. I don't have enough experience with this system yet to be sure. 2 -- Would it be better to enter with 2 lots, closing 1 at the zero point and letting the other ride to see how far it will go? Probably only as long as you can be present to monitor the price action? You can be sure we are listening to whatever you have to say about this strategy. Thanks again for the help, Dave

--- 帖子 #129 ---
With the oscillators or overlays is easy to explain the past, and the theory is OK, but we are trading live... I taked as example the chart from post #63. You can see that a back analysis at 05:30 show us for 01:45 a spread = 21. Hurrah, we trade the past and we take our pips. But, live, at 01:45 the spread was only 6 pips, and live we would never traded this small spread. For this reason, I have developed the osc_v4 indicator, to realistically analyze the past. I'm sure that the NeutralHedge has potential, and I'm waiting on results from the live application of the system and indicators. .

--- 帖子 #130 ---
All great disccusion points!! For me, I just do the 1 hr. I find the 15min or 5 min swings too small, and as mentioned above. And the past is indeed easy to trade!! But we will be led astray as noted above if the analysis we are being shown by the indicator is not accurate, or repaints... which is the GREAT thing SwingMan is doing here, working to get a non-repainting indicator that shows the price action relationship. With price action trading, (which is what this is, despite the enhancements of the indicators), we can perhaps learn more from the past than other types of trading.. Post #1, that got us going, was good ol' price action divergence after all!! The original method was to take opposing positions in our SychPair in a demo account, and watch the net value of both positions rise and fall. Then, by pure price action, you begin to "see" what the Osc shows us, a high spread, and a low spread, and somewhere in between, a "zero" line. And yes, it would be better to find a way to determine when the swing is turning, as it is with single-pair trading.... and there may be a way to increase the slice of the pie we take... but for me, I like conservitive. I am perfectly happy with 80p instead of 120p, if the percentages are there, and I can manage it... GREAT idea on the two-step exits, one at "Zero" and one at the turn...!! It will be fun to see how this develop in realtime. Last few weeks have been just as anticiapted, very workable....

--- 帖子 #131 ---
My GJ/EJ SynchPair just hit a TriggerDelta (Threshold) of &gt; 100, so I took a Sell GJ @ 211.56 and a Buy EJ @ 167.23. I will close at Delta = 0, and try to track the max DD as we go... We'll see!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
TriggerDelta 100? Other indicators, other trade directions, other results... We'll see! .

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The main point in this system is MaxLoss and right time to enter a trade in order to minimize drawdown of each trade. So we need to determine difference/loss rate. For example 90pip defference and 90 pip maxloss.

My BravoBoomerang just just triggered on my PhasarPair. Next stop...The Twilight Zone.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
HI Bill, I would be careful of that BravoBoomerang if I were you,,, it really killed my ZipWop.... Sorry SwingMax... I have been working on coding a very similar approach for a whiles now... my "TriggerDelta" is your "Threshold".... the Delta being the difference between the two currency pairs being traded. Initially, I was working with no indicators, just price. For example, current price of the GU - current price of the EU, minus a "ZeroFactor", which is just a number used to get to Zero. The trick is to determine WHERE zero is. With the advent of the overlay indicator, and now your oscillator, the algorithm there determines a "Zero". One that is "determined", however we do it, we can then track the two pairs as them move further away and back towards this zero. In that tracking, we see (hopefully) good, low(er) risk entry points. We are all moving the same direction... except that BravoBoomerang... ha! PS: update on my trade of 131 above.... closed earlier today for +74p, see attached screenshot... waiting for the next entry now! (REV. correct Overlay chart shown....)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
@mrkam, just a question: in your overlay chart, is the Mirroring true or false? I think we haven't the same parameter.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Yes! There is something odd about my Overlay... I will check into it and update this post with what I find... But, the trade was taken by code that does not refer to the Overlay chart, just currency values and the Osc indicator.... hmmmm..... OK... Removed the old overlay and put your (SwingMan's) overlay chart on, mirroring set to false.. Should be accurate now...???

Thanks. Yes and no. Maybe have you ideas how to use the relation of correlations on multiple time frames. Then can I write a RelationCorrelation oscillator. In the next step can I write a Dashboard for the analysis of the pairs, with signals, alerts, emails, and so. I think that 20x20 pairs x 2 mirrorings are enough for our purposis. .

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Now THAT is interesting!! I will have to noodle that a bit... Perhaps we can consider the multi-time frame correlations similarly to trends... look for divergence... Per your charts, when the 1D and 1H correlations for the same set of pairs are similar, not much opportunity,... but when the 1H gets out of synch with the 1D, perhaps there will be opportunity... figuring ultimately the 1H will get back in synch with the 1D... gotta put some time into that concept!! THANKS!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Sure! In the tables we can see many unsynchronalities, and here are many energie for your BBP sytem (Big-Bang-Pendulum). Matter of course, you must also define criterions for ranking the combinations. Don't forget to take in consideration a criterion for ranking the current TriggerDelta!!

You may need to adjust the date to 2 or 3 days before today's date for it to work properly. I need to find out more about that from SwingMan. He created these indicators.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi ,guys, I'm using the same tehnique as you, and all the new indicators, but have a problem, the new ones didn't comply if we change the option mirroring true/false. It cannot be adjusted at all. Maybe if I remove from the script the "default" correlating pair it wil allow to change this option. Did you notice that?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
asta fac acum...

Hi Swingman, I have set the StartingTimeCorr input variable on NeutralHedge osc_v3 to three days before the present date and it seems to work right. Does it have to be always set three days back? Why do I get the error message alert popup that says "StartingTimeCorr seems to be wrong" when I enter the date two days back from the present date? Does this variable have to be reset every day to keep it that amount of time behind so it will work properly? I also notice that when I'm trying to use a 30m TF it won't show the bars all the way up to the present time and when I change the date to make them show properly I get that error message again. Could you give me some suggestions?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I removed from the script the "default" correlations of the pairs, and now we can check @mrkam results... Instead of the term "mirroring" now I use the term "correlation", because it is better to understand. (Correlated pairs are not mirroring, and not correlated pairs are mirroring...) We can see that the oscillator v4 show the same informations as both oscillators v3 to different overlay times! .

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Is this the indicator v3.1? (On questions, please post the chart) - On monday we have the samday two days ago... I checked with 2008.07.05 (samday) and 2008.07.06 (sunday), and I become also the error message. - The original Overlay indicator, and my oscillator v3.1 works with "WindowBarsPerChart()" and an appropriate formula. For this reason I changed the algorithm and take only fix periods. You can try to become all the bars in oscillator on taking more bars in the chart and redrawing. (To this time I haven't the osc_v3, because I overwrited him, and for me is he program technically obsolet) .

In post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...nghedge&amp;page=2 you find a few things about a hedging idea. In post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...t=53919&amp;page=3 are few correlation indicators from me. If we need this, I can adapt this indicators for the NeutralHedge, and you can make suggestions.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
For today I traded the nice spread at 11:53, and to this time we have the "Mataf pair correlations": 94.9 daily and 33.7 hourly. Is to check on trade closing which values we have.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hello everyone Very interesting ideas! To hedge or perform arbitrage, you have to sell/buy a proper amount of lots for each pair, right? For example, you cannot just buy 1 lot of EURUSD together with 1 lot of USDCHF to hedge, because they have different volatilities. Instead, you may need to buy 100 lot of EURUSD and buy 57.8 lot of USDCHF to accurately balance them. But then, we need to have a huge amount of capital to do so.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I closed the trade. Win = 31 Pips - 10 spread = 21 pips. Mataf correlations: Daily = 94.9, H1 = 21.5 .

--- 帖子 #151 ---
SwingMan, What did you see that made you close the trade? Bruce

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Why would you use mirroring on those pairs when they are highly + correlated? Isn't your chart showing the reverse of reality?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I see the oscillator bars in the other colour and the cross of the ranged pair lines. Because I traded live, I closed quickly the orders (I'm not a trader, and can't watch the screen all the time.) Maybe can @mrkam better explain. My english is very poor, and I need many time to write few rows for an answer, OK? .

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Swingman Thank you very much for developing these indicators, it shows your deep understanding of what is needed to do these type of trades. I do have a question or two though, it might be very basic for others who are used to your indicators but unfortuneately not for me. Question 1: In the Overlay indicator you have: Period ratio- what does it mean? You also have Factor-Threshold- what does it mean and how do you use it? Question 2: On the chart is printed HedgeRange - Do I understand correct that this is the maximum pips available at that point minus the spreads ? You also have Threshold - what does it mean and how do you use it? It would very much appreciate your comments as I do like this method of trading very much. Thank you Regards

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I don't know! Sure you are right, but yesterday I learned from the trade of @mrkam that: - the correlation may be not important - for a correlated pair, we can have a small spread in the mirror, and a big spread in the normal chart. We can take to trade the larger of this two figures, and @mrkams BBP theory assure us the win. To take decisions in the practice, we need a dashboard with signals, and a little EA for ordering. If I see that also other members post results and I can learn what to do is, I can develope such tools.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Sincerly I'm sory, but to answer you, or to describe all the functionalitys is a big problem for me. Maybe later. My english is miserable, and I haven't the time to search in the dictionary (at the time I'm in office, and later I must further programe indicators). I hope that other user can explain such questions.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Nice one SwingMan. What do you think about that Hedge-Rocks EA that Alphaone posted? Is it anything we can use to apply to this strategy? Also, which version of the NeutralHedge osc are you using now? It looks like everything is on the chart. Are you using the highest correlated, or non-correlated pairs to trade? I made a good trade today using the GBPJPY vs USDCHF and the hourly correlation was +59 but the daily was -34. What is interesting is that neither timeframe was very much toward + or - so what does that tell us? Also, do you have an EA that can close only specific pairs when the profit gets to a certain level? Now I'm using one that will close the "basket" of open trades at a certain account profit. That is fine if you only have one hedge on with two pairs, but if you have one hedge in profit and are waiting for the other one to finish up it will close that one too. Any ideas? Even better would be one that would open the trades at a certain threshold and close at a certain profit only on that hedge, but that may be asking for way too much. Dave

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi mrkam, This is a question I asked Swingman earlier, and I'm hoping you can help with this too: Do you have an EA that can close only specific pairs when the profit gets to a certain level? Now I'm using one that will close the "basket" of open trades at a certain account profit. That is fine if you only have one hedge on with two pairs, but if you have one hedge in profit and are waiting for the other one to finish up it will close that one too. Any ideas? Even better would be one that would open the trades at a certain threshold and close at a certain profit only on that hedge, but that may be asking for way too much. Thanks, Dave

--- 帖子 #159 ---
For the NeutralHedge strategy we close the trades if the spread is zero, or for the Threshold value. Maybe in the next time I develope such an EA. I don't use other EAs (as mine). Maybe SwissArmyKniffe, or MT (MP?) are good. I don't know.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I thinked today to a solution, maybe write I in the afternoon the functions because: in my trade from today, I maked two mistakes: 1. - I taked the chart EURUSD and not EURJPY, and I selled EURUSD. Than, I close this oder. 2. - I taked the right EURJPY chart, but I buyed the pair! Than I closed this order, and only in the third try I gived the right order! All this, because I'm in office and haven't the time to think to mutch about order details.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
iT HAPPENS TO ME TOO!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
PistolDave.... I know of two EAs in the works for this strategy, that will independently trade any two pairs you want. Not ready for prime time yet. Both are costing the developers $$ as they are hiring programmers to do the work, so don't know yet if they will be given away for free.... Other than that, I don't know of an EA that will do what you ask.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif

--- 帖子 #163 ---
We really need an EA to manage specific couple of pairs, maybe someone can modify the Equity manager to make this job... If we solve this problem, then.... everything will be just fun.... i have not the skills, but i think it's simple enough, the EA must watch simultaneous for the pairs that we will enter in the options panel (it has to be more options like EU/GU, EU/CF, GU/CF, EJ/AJ, GJ/UJ, GJ/EJ, etc) and close them separately (as basket of 2 pairs) when they reach a customizable profit level. In this case you can trade simultaneously many baskets, which manually is very hard to follow. Anyone interested?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi everybody, May i know why period_ratio must set 72? Please advice. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
It doesn't. It has to do with how SwingMans' indicator calculates the Threshold (I think?). A longer period means more bars means a different Threshold, based on the extremes of the swings of the included history. You can set it for whatever you want, and either use or not use his threshold calc, but the main thing is to stay consistent. Changing it will re-set the bars as well, so one bar may be 120 at period 72, but 90 at period 200, changing your corresponding threshold. I would recommend you playing with the settings. See what it does with the bars, and with the threshold. Personally, I like to look back at least a week to see the recent swings, letting that past market action help me in determining my entry points, (he calls that the threshold...) hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks mrkam.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Dave, You can try this one. If you enter two trades for the Hedge, put the same Comment in the Trade box. In that case the EA will watch for those comments and close both pairs as soon as profit target has been reached. I haven't tested it yet, because I am still at work, but I think this will work. This example is for the GBPJPY and EURJPY hedge, but you can use it for any set of pairs. Each set must have their own unique Magic Comment as I call it. The MagicComment in the EA must be the same as the Comment you fill at the manual entry orders.

I have been involved in spread trading for years. First for my private account and then as a hedge fund manager . I was doing spread trading on futures but not the way it is usualy done. I was making arbitrage between the correlated eurostoxx future and the french Fce ( cac4 future). We were a team and made huge profits so decided to built a BVI hedge fund. The conjonction of volatility becoming lower and automatic robots settled by banks made us change of arbitrage supports . We built a model for spreading eurostoxx agains S&amp;P futures with great reward. This one was more complicated because of exchange rate and no same hours of opening for volume. But a great advantage was because of that no robots could arbitrate it. When i started tradinf FX my main idea had been to do the same because one of the great advantage of spread trading is that you are more confortable with your position no betting on a direction but more on differences. There are differents way to do that on FX i will explain the simpliest one which is profitable ( i used it for 1 year with nice rewards) , now i am working with the same philosophy, same pairs but with proprietary formulas for a fine tune. I am still trading professionaly as an asset manager on FX. With 7 figures account. 1) I am only trading eur/usd and usd/chf for 2 reasons . First it is the most negatively correlated paire on forex on a long and short term basis. Second, even if you find one more correlated it will be too much volatil for spread trading the way i do it (forget immediatly of thinking of gbp or jpy involved in spread trading, that is a killer account). 2) Please dont tell me that spread trading these paires is the same as trading eur/chf outright, please dont write that even if you can copy it from supposed serious web site. The ones saying that have never follow days and night as i did the 3 paires together. 3) Contrary at what i have read in this thread entry point is not that important. You have not to find the perfect entry call but one which is #acceptable# ( i will explain later). 4) dont tell me about stops there are no stops in this trading style 5) you need to be capitalised because be prepared to average. Yes i know you are not supposed to do that so please dont tell me . I never average a loosing position in trading outright, spreadtrading is very different. So dont take a 1million position with 10k tio iniate a position 6) Dont look at what was the price of eur/usd 3 years ago and same for usd/chf and tell your paire is not correlated the way you said it was because you have to reactualised the datas several times per month . Here are the very basic and exemples: Look at the 3 graphes eur/usd usd/chf and eur/chf : 4 hours or 1 hour candells are ok. A raisonable entry point is when a divergence appeas on eur/chf . The more you wait the safer you are but the less number of trades you are going to make. In theory ( only) the divergence is suppose to stop and go back to neutral as the correlation is strong. To neutralise the usd problem and be in market neutral ( very important point always put aside by 80% od spread traders) you have to take 1 lot of euro/usd for every 1.5 lot of usd/chf and actualise this ratio each time eur/usd mooves a lot to try to be close to a market neutral position. So let say eur/chf is -0.20% for example you are in alert because close to an entry point, I recommand at the beginning not entering before 0.25/0.30 divergence but personaly i start building my position at 0.20 divergence. So you wait -0.25% for exemple as yesterday when i enter a position. I took 1 position ( meaning 1 eur/usd ans 1.5 usd/chf) long on both : Long 1 lot euro/usd at 1.5702 Long 1.5 lot usd/chf at 1.0260 Depending on brokers you have to pay the spread let us say that you have 7 pips spread for the 2 buy. You start with a loss of 7 pips ( 3 on euro/usd and 4 on usd/chf for exemple). You have to wait 0.05% moove your way to cover the spread Then you wait , if the divergence goes to -0.45 you put one more position ( 1 and 1.5) if goes to -0.65 you put one more ( you can wait longer if you have a small account or want to be more conservative). If the divergence goes more than 0.65% you wait till 1% ( almost never happen). That means that you can handle this kind of divergence without being margin called so dont start with a 200 leverage. Usually it goes rarely over 0.40/0.45. Yesterday after -0.25% from my memory it goes only -0.32%. I closed the position few hours after at 1.0324 and 1.5652 ( i closed half when divergence went back to 0 and the remaining at +0.20. We then went to +0.40% ( of course i was short now starting at +0.30( +0.30 and not 0.20/0.25 because i waited for the trend weakening). That is, with the1/1.5 ratio almost 60pips. Usually you make small profits and some bigs one when averaging 2 or 3 times. You could have make more ( 70 pips ) by playing eur/chf on that one but it is more difficult to keep a directional position if you are wrong than a hedged one ( from several point of vue and from a psychological one which is the most important part of trading as all of you knows...........Not all of you know that ? I closed this one this morning ( eur/chf was -0.15%). I am now waiting -0.30/-0.35 to get in again ( we are -0.15% but i know that compared to to days ago we are close to +0.10 so i will wait a little bit more ( that is one part of the actualisation and fine tuning i was speaking about) One advantage to be ON on a long position is that you get the swap on the eur/usd and sone brokers are paying a + rollover on usd/chf as well. This is the simpliest way to be profitable on FX according to me of course. So where are the risks? They are in case there is a huge think happening in switzerland or in europe ( i am not speaking of decision rate ( you could say i will never be in a position before an annouvement on rate for exemple) i am more thinking of a blast somewhere. And for me these is not a risk but during these days by spread trading you can make a fortune as i wil explain 1 day if somebody is interested in.

spieler spieler, Could you post a screen shot of what you mentioned of the three charts and show us the divergence you were talking about? Would appreciate it. Thanks. Also interested in that last comment about making a lot of money. Please share that too. Bruce

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Spieler, Please do explain! Very interesting strategy.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
i will post one exemple later today. As how to trade exceptional events it needs to be experienced in spread trading first and as it occurs only 1 or 2 times per year i have time to explain .

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Would you mind going into that a little bit further. How is trading the 2 pairs separately different from trading the cross? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
If you read what he wrote above--- you will see he already answered you.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Fierceman, rolls are best paid on eur/usd + usd/chf than on eur/chf from a psychological approach you feel more secured with holding the 2 paires that are well corelated and can cut one leg in case one dont moove and the other rallye just one minute ( it happends often). I agree you could have a strategy based on correlation , not paying the spread and calling only eur/chf but i have never makes the big bucks i make on hedging the 2. Perhaps cutting to soon the outright trading. When you enter a long on the 2 paires if one is rallying you eneter this one first , you have the finger on the mouse ready to catch the other one falling so thet you win precious pips in yout position . On future spread it was different because i could be 100% market neutral that cannot be the same with only 2 paires

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Many thanks Spieler for your explanations! I haven't understand what you mean under "divergence". Is this maybe the divergence between EURUSD/USDCHF and EURCHF (triangular arbitrage)?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
If you read what I wrote above--- you will see that I was asking him to explain the very statement you say answers my question. spieler, depending on your broker, you're right, rollover can be better when buying the pairs separately. I don't buy the psychological advantage bit, but I can see how you might be able to scalp a few pips by cutting one of the legs without paying extra spread. However, that exposes you to USD so your method is no longer entirely USD-neutral. Anyway, thanks for the explanation, and good luck.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
SwingMan, On the display for the EURUSD USDCHF it has Buy EURUSD Sell USDCHF..... Shouldn't it be either Buy EURUSD Buy USDCHF or Sell EURUSD Sell USDCHF Otherwise you don't have a hedge. Bruce

I think he is reffering at change in price +/- 20% found this: http://www.cnbc.com/id/15839178/site/14081545/

--- 帖子 #185 ---
At 1300 eur/us +0.25% us/chf -0.20% eur/chf +0.05% I understand that eur/chf should go to +- 0.30% or 0.40% I'm ok?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
You are right that s the general idea

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Did you get my PM spieler? What kind of sucess rate could one expect from this strategy?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
So you are waiting now for a change in eur/chf, ? simple as that?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Many thanks. Now I understand that divergence 20% is between the current price and the daily close from yesterday. OK, for me is this a difference and not a divergence but no problem, in my indicators are also such complicated formulas...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
So far decorrelation is too small ( +0,12%) to start building a position So you wait . Waiting is 80 % at least of this job

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes spieler please share some print screens of your divergence

--- 帖子 #192 ---
is CNBC the best to spot the difference, or what source do you use?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I think in every of my charts from above we have 2-3 differgences, and this are calculated dynamic. Differences to yesterday closes are more static.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
you just need real time graphs whatever the name under is an exemple

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi spieler, Thanks for you sharing. The ratio of 1.5 lot usd/chf to 1 lot eur/usd doesn't precisely make you market neutral right? It got to be 1.5xxx to 1 I guess. So even the pair correlation stays the same, the price movement in them can give you some money loss as they cannot balance each other well enough. So is this kind of loss negligible? Also, when I look at the eur/chf, I can see it doesn't really always have a sideway movement (i.e. they seem to have a trend in the long run, eur is worthing more and more compared to chf in the first half of this year). So their correlation seems to be unstable, making usd/chf and eur/usd cannot be hedged sometimes?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
UNless there is something I do not understand then I believe there is a problem with this indicator: I opened 2 charts One with EURUSD 1H one with USDCHF 1H I plotted the NeutralHedgeOverlay v3 on both with the same parameters: Both PeriodRatio=72 plus Correlation=False. Obviosly I put as the subsymbol the opposite currency on the different charts. PLease look at the charts I attach: you get different instructions on both: One say Buy EurUsd &amp; Sell UsdChf the other say Sell EurUsd &amp; Buy UsdChf. Surely the message should be the same does not matter which chart you use with the other currency as the subsymbol. Any ideas or comments? Regards

--- 帖子 #197 ---
@silver Only for four main pairs I give automatically the correlation/mirroring parametrs. For other pairs must you give this.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Swingman I thought that is what I did. Since these pairs are out of sinc with each other I did put in the preset the Value of -1 which means they are not in correlation. If I understand this wrong then please tell me what I am doing wrong. I do like your indicators and would really like to understand them correctly. Your answer will be appreciated. Regards

--- 帖子 #199 ---
- I see the figures, and my ask is if this figures +-x% are calculated from the close of yesterday, or are maybe momentum values? - The price relation EURUSD/USDCHF is e.g. 1.52 (1.5708/1.0327) We have also an ATR relation of 1.14 (0.0024 / 0.0021). Isn't beter to take 1 lot for EURUSD and 1.52*1.14 = 1.73 lots for USDCHF !?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Spieler i really appreciate if you explain how do you get this eur/u us/chf ratio 1 lot / 1.5 lot and how do you adjust it. thanks

--- 帖子 #201 ---
The ratio of 1.5 lot usd/chf to 1 lot eur/usd doesn't precisely make you market neutral right? It got to be 1.5xxx to 1 I guess. So even the pair correlation stays the same, the price movement in them can give you some money loss as they cannot balance each other well enough. So is this kind of loss negligible? I said that you had to ajust from time to time 1 to 1,5 is acceptable if you trade with oanda for exemple you can do 1 and 1,57 today To find 1,5 or1,57 you just have to find the ratio making usd market neutral very easy Also, when I look at the eur/chf, I can see it doesn't really always have a sideway movement (i.e. they seem to have a trend in the long run, eur is worthing more and more compared to chf in the first half of this year). So their correlation seems to be unstable, making usd/chf and eur/usd cannot be hedged sometimes? I said in my first post not to check on a long term basis as you need to adjust sometimes. You dont have to say for exemple 1 year ago euro/usd was xxx and usd/chf YYY and eur/chf zzzz so things should be the same now. That means that you cannot take a position and keep it 1 month or 1 year. Every day is an other day and forget about the 2 days ago correlation I was sleeping lol i missed the short we went to +0,25% divergence and are back to 0,16 now

--- 帖子 #202 ---
a position is long long or short short and never long short that is an outright position correlation is negativ on this 2 paires

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thank you for your explanation spieler I understand much better now Talking about correlation, we got to have a reference point where we assume the divergence is zero there, and then all current +/-% divergence we calculate would be comparing to that "starting point". You advice us to forget about the 2 days ago correlation, so how far would you go back to find a proper reference point usually? Just use yesterday close? Or would there be a dynamic way to calculate the divergence %?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
You advice us to forget about the 2 days ago correlation, so how far would you go back to find a proper reference point usually? Just use yesterday close? Or would there be a dynamic way to calculate the divergence %? You can start to work with yesterday close and then add some dynamic things such has if yesterday finished at +0,30 you wil wait more for a long than for a short. This is enough to be profitable so far

--- 帖子 #205 ---
aNY STARTING POINT IS CHANGING! Sorry! Where do you think correlation was perfect in the past? Could you point a specific date? NO So, everything is in movement That's why you don't have to look in the past....too much

--- 帖子 #206 ---
What charting service do you use? Metatrader didn't provide this info (+/- %)

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Spieler, Divergence % for the choice of direction Long Short Is it -25% for Long and +25% for Short Is that how direction for entries are deternined? Bruce

--- 帖子 #208 ---
This is the way I understand ti too If diff negative, then buy both pairs, diff negative then sell both. Is this correct Spieler? Hm, r u from Germany?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I use prorealtime or e signal Think of spread trading as a rubber band or as a vibrating machine Once you stretch it is is supposed to go back and sometimes goes further the other way unless it breaks So -0,25% means going long yes waiting correlation to take its revenge

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi spieler, Thanks for helping to explain more about spread trading. Right now we are in the process of learning how it all works. Could someone using MT4 platform post a current screenshot of a trade they took and mark it showing the entry time and exit and what the correlation was at the time. Also, is anyone using Mataf to get the correlations? If not, where can you get them? This seems more confusing the more I learn about it, but it should be fairly simple once you get the hang of it. I want to keep working on this until I really understand it because I think it can be very profitable like spieler says. pd

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Can some one make an indicator for Metatrader that could show these divergence +/-% ?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Here have you an EA, but without trading orders...! I hope I have understood the formulas. .

Had to improve this EA for closing manually entered Hedge orders. Point value on second symbol was wrong. The default setting is for the combination GBPJPY versus EURJPY with a 20 pip profit value, just for trying. Of course you can use this for any combination.

I have use it (the previous version) ,but it has some bugs, I think, as it had closed twice the pairs like -48/+10, so, in total loss, so I disable it. This is a new version?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
if you are referring to post 214, then yes. But as always, you must demo test it first.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Previously today it signaled a successful short trade. It just signaled a long: EUR/CHF was at 0% Eur/USD = +.50% USD/CHF = -.50% These are all give or take .02% or so. Doesn't that indicate a balanced situation? Does that show any kind of divergence? I wouldn't think it does. Maybe I need to restudy the concept. Thanks

--- 帖子 #218 ---
You must waaaait. - The EA show the trend direction e.g "long trade" for divergence &lt; setted limit = 0.25%. - When the divergence is over 0.25%, you'll see "LONG trade" and a vertical arrow.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I see. Thanks

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Now we can wait the trading signals! The EA take trades on three levels: 0.25%, 0.45% and 0.65% (first level + step 0.20%), and close the trades on null. I hope they arn't to many bugs in the EA! .

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hello Swingman, Thank you for creating an ea for this. I am wondering with this version do we need any indicators? Thank You, Jeff

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I don't know, I'm only the programmer...! (Please reload the EA, I just replaced the file)

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Swing Man, First of all, Thank you for your hard work. You're an excellent programmer and a generous person. Have you weighted the value of the USD/CHF by 1.5 ? Let me tell you what I've discovered. I can program AmiBroker and I have been playing around with these pairs. If I make a composite signal by combining (1) long EUR/USD and (1) long USD/CHF, the resulting line chart looks nothing like the EUR/CHF. If I combine (1) long EUR/USD and (1.5) USD/CHF, it looks identical to EUR/CHF. I'm wondering when we look for divergence if we shouldn't weight the value of U/CHF x 1.5. For example if it is -.06% from the daily open, make it -.09%. How hard would it be to make an input to your EA to allow that? Thanks

--- 帖子 #224 ---
It just signaled a long: EUR/CHF was at 0% Eur/USD = +.50% USD/CHF = -.50% THis indicates a perfect negativ decorrelation and that means that you have to wait. You should keep 1/1,5 ratio otherwise you get a directional bias and that is not in th ephilosophy of th emethod. Once step one has been well understood i will explain how to profit on a trendy moove by scaling out on one leg ( i know that means you'll be directonal once done) And you can do that only on beiing on the 2 paires instead of the eur/chf alone

--- 帖子 #225 ---
The EA hasn't shown those figures- not even close. What time does your daily bar end? Thanks. EDIT- My mistake. You were quoting my previous post. I just now noticed.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes, in program I taked as LotsRatio the price ratio at the order time, and this is now 1.53, but I think this isn't enough, we must take alse the volatility (ATR) in consideration, and I'm waiting on an answer from Spieler. For you(!) I post the release v2.1 with default input of the LotsRatio=1.5, and you can change it. Later make I maybe an indicator, but I think it is enough to draw two horizontal lines at yesterday close +- 0.25% (or */ 1.0025). .

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi Spieler, maybe is better to open a separat thread for your wonderfull hedge system. I think we have here two different approaches for the neutral market trading.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Thank you. I didn't mean just using 1:1.5 when the trade's placed. I meant using it to calculate the divergence. Right now I'm seeing: EUR/CHF = 0.16% EUR/USD = -0.15% USD/CHF = 0.30% I think the USD/CHF should be weighted.(or the option given to weight it) Like this: EUR/CHF = 0.16% EUR/USD = -0.15% USD/CHF = 0.45% (.30 x 1.5) Do you see what I mean? Thanks

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I understand. Only Spieler, with his practice experience can comment this.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
i was out for 3 hours missed again a short. I am still looking for a short position as we are +0,20% I see what you mean by wheighting usd/chf with 1,5 but i dont think you should care abour that . The ratio is juste here to neutralise , as far as possible , the directional bias. If i get in i will make a snapshot of the graphs

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I just opened ( OANDA ) LONG (UNIT)100 eur/u 157 us/c at E/CHF + .22% IF the price e/chf continue up, I will add the same num of unit at +0.40- 0.45%

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I think I have the answer: ONLY the prices have the ratio 1.5, and this is a ratio for our lots. If you multiply both prices (yesterdays close and current price) with 1.5, you have mathematicaly the same LotsRatio.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I was wrong ,. the same but SHORT

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Surely short! I don't know whay, but the ordering is not functioning, and maybe in the afternoon can I find the bug. .

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Could not wait 0,25% i am in short at +0,22% 2 lots eur/usd 3 lots USD/chf. Will post later graphs

--- 帖子 #236 ---
+0,25% now and i said patience was part of the game!! So this was a good entry point at +0,25% Anyway 0,22 is not that bad

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Yes, and now I have a question for the exit: if I have TODAY the 0% value for the divergence I close the trades. But maybe I don't see this value today, and must wait until TOMMOROW. The question is how to calculate the divergence tomorrow, because we have with the close of the day an another basis point and another divergences as today!!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I'm sorry, but even this version v6 is closing orders with negative total. Ex. -85/+50 just closed 5 mins ago....so something is still wrong. Maybe it will be an ideea to make calculations in USD profit, not in pips... And I don't know why in the comments appears "magic comment" and "Order comment", witch is from another position?!? Ex. sell EURUSD/USDCHF, comment Hedge EUF, and another hedge EURUSD/GBPUSD, comment EUG, then appears on chart "magic comment Hedge EUF, but "order comment" EUG or other.... Insteed the values of +/- pips is accurate for the specific order, but still don't understand why it close them negative

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Swing Man, What data is your Natural Hedge MACD based on?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I don't understood your question. .

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Position is now showing a tiny profit ( i was up 890$ but was short 2mios euro and 3mios usd/chf) after entry i was down 1700$ because of the spread so th erecovery is good . Usually i never cut before a 2K profit. As for the question on what happen if we close the day without having see a return to zero there are several possibilities. 1) I consider the profit to be acceptable i take it if i am long i keep th eposition to get the roll. 2) i keep the position and tomorrow when starting at zero i add mentaly the today moove in % 5 not sure to be clear lol) if we finish at +0,10% then we started at 0 i consider we startied at +0,10 because yesterday price are so closed that they remain actual

--- 帖子 #242 ---
@ mrkam could you please tell me what versions and indicators are you using now? if posssible show a picture with your last trade. I still with a chart using the oscv2 and your original overlay. it would be very usefull for me. thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
OK, thanks. Now I found a dynamic solution for your nice hedge system. Because sometimes we must considere "virtual" values and not the current calculated values, then we don't need to use the daily closes as reference point. The general dynamic solution is to take as reference points the points where the MACD change the slope! If someone is interested for this idea, I can develope later an EA.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Please do, I will test it!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
i JUST close the trades with few pips profit... tomorrow I will try to get into around 25% at least.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes you are right. I think it has to do with the lotsize, so it would be better to choose for a Cash amount as profit target. I have changed this. The Order Comment can be found when you choose for Trading -&gt; Order. In this popup you manually set your trade order and in the Comment field you fill in your unique Comment. Both hedge trades must have the same Comment. If you then use the EA you must put this same name in the MagicComment. These names must be exactly the same to make the EA work properly.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I understand that, and it was exactly like this I will test this version too PS Ok, tested, despite everything is ok, it closes only one position, not both. And seems to have no error message in logs....

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi All, Been admiring this system. Just brought up the new EA and I'm already taking first short positions (in demo). Thanks a lot for the excellent system Spieler and EA SwingMan. I will try to contribute where I can, by posting forward test results, when I'm not working at least. Thanks again.. bigp

--- 帖子 #249 ---
SwingMan, I have been running this EA since you posted it, but it has not taken any trades. Has anyone else been trading this EA? Has it taken any trades for you? I am running it on a IBFX demo... Bruce

--- 帖子 #250 ---
SwingMan posted that it wouldn't take trades. He said he would try to fix it, today.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I tried to program the automatic order, and hope that your accounts not go bankrupt... - the automatic is for begin disabled, you can activate. - you can give a profit target and a stop loss in pips. - alert option for signals - you can give a SymbolSuffix "m" for brokers with EURUSDm,USDCHFm,EURUSDm - I have drawn the first two trading levels - you can give manual market orders and close automatic, but you must take into account that in this instance also order from other systems will be closed. .

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Thank you. Do you have to set a SL and TP? Is there a default method of exiting? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thankyou very much for your EAs. I love seeing them improve upon eachother. One question though. Why do you have it set to only be used in demo accounts? I wouldn't mind using them live with a micro account.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I have no idea only because I am the programmer and not system autor. The SL and TP must you and other members to test whether they are needed or not. Spieler says that we do not need StopLosses.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
It seems that market wants to decorrelate up again this morning,looks like we will have to put a second lot if it continious this way. Not a problem with 2 lots rewards are better The lower yesdterday was +0,10% the position was winning but then it went up again.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Dragosd1, the position that closed, was this the position with a positive result and the second not? If the first one was positive and second is less than the total reached, it could happen that the second doesn't get closed. With the new version both positions should be closed now. I hope that this will finally be the right one. Thank you for your patience and helping with the test.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
True, and until when we do this? Comparing to yesterday open, the market is now at +0.32%.....

--- 帖子 #258 ---
In fact it was one at +50 and the other at +10. It closes the +50 position. And they stay at +60 (both) at least 2 minutes. Could you make it react faster? I will test the new one....

--- 帖子 #259 ---
"True, and until when we do this? Comparing to yesterday open, the market is now at +0.32%....." Whathever the system patience is everything......... I am waiting now +0,20 for today will be 0,45 from my yesterday entry point. Some weeks you have 2/3 trades per day others 1 or 2 per week. You will be surprised how fast it can goes backward sometimes a couple of minutes is enough. W'll see

--- 帖子 #260 ---
An indicator to see the historical divergences. The divergence is calculated for highs and lows related to the close of yesterday. Dear Spieler, I repeat my request if you will to open a new thread for their system. I believe that now no one here know whether we discussed and post indicators for the NeutralHedge or for the SpielersHedge.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Ok, I tested it, but now it doesn't close naything, LOL. The position has reached +65 (sum of both), the close setting was +50, it shows the correct value(+65), but didn't close the position. It may be a problem if there is another EA running on the platform? I have the EA Equity Manager running. I will try it without this.....

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi, Thank for you enormous work! I have no problem to download "SpielersHedge EA v1.ex4" but have problem to drop this indicator on the chart. It is not possible. Why? With "NeutralHedge MACD.ex4", no problem. Thank for your answer!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
You have to put it into Experts folder, as it is a semi EA right now

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi, Is it possible to add a soundalert when the trading is ok and one when the line are crossing with the possible to select a margin around the crossing? Thank you very much!

No way, it didn't close at all. It reaches twice the profit, but nothing....And no error message.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
SwingMan, Here's a definite bug in your new EA. It hit the Long trigger and opened up 2 hedges (should have been 1) Then it went on and continuously opened long USD/CHF positions. It had opened over 90 when I turned it off.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Who said there was not point using a demo?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Yes I know! I can only in 4-5 hours find the bug. I hope your account isn't bankroupt !?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Not a problem. I can easily open another

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Swingman &amp; Bill, I tested the new version and I had the same problem. It seems to open a new position on EURUSD and USDCHF on every tick change in price. I guess it would keep opening new positions until there was no more margin. Looks like you are making some good progress, though. Keep going! pd

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Swingman - ow are you calculating the spieler divergence indicator? Is it this formula? spielers divergence % (EURCHF): (100 * Close[0] / iClose(NULL,PERIOD_D1,1)) - 100

--- 帖子 #277 ---
In principle of course, yes. But as Spieler says, there are some typical programming fine tunings.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Bill &amp; Dave I am very happy to tell you the buggs have been rectified. From Monday you can make money! Until then I will maybe some programming, and on sunday poste I get the new release Until then you can sleep peacefully. Here a little script to delete all active orders . ( copy please in ..\experts\scripts ) Use carefully the script, because ALL active orders from account are deleted.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thanks, SwingMan

--- 帖子 #280 ---
hi.. I dont mean to be critical....but all this time on EA's and such and nobody really knows if the idea works or not... Has anybody actually look forward (manually) and taken trades...if so how did it go..

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi Angler.... The Spieler approach looks very interesting, I have chose to work the "old" Oscillator v3.1 and 3.3, both back checking and forward for about 3 weeks now... since I do it manually, I do it pretty much at the closes of the 1hr oscillator bars. Even at that, very successful. These newer versions by Swingman don't repaint, so should be good for manual checking. I have an EA I am developing for that approach, based on these indicators, in beta, also successful. We'll see. But I agree... one needs to pick one approach and work it. I have chosed to work the v3.1 and 3.3 approach, as I have laid it out in earlier (now old news...) posts. For me, it works. About 4-6 trades a month per pair of pairs, about 50-120p per trade, no losses, max virtual DD about 70-120p... It's not hard to do, so you can do it yourself as well.... good success to you!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Thanks SwingMan, I'm looking forward to using the new release. Used SpielersHedge EA_v2.1 to enter two trades manually today about an hour apart. +11pips on one position and +21pips on the other so far. When do you think is the best time to close the positions? When the correlation goes back to zero, or at a certain pip gain?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I do not know, I have programmed and have no time to think or to trade. I did not trade the system like you, after one trade you're the great expert ...! But , you see in the Divergence indicator that the ratios often do not return to zero, that says also Spieler. A pip profit one can not take automatically, because the curves are changing. What remains ? There is still the fine tuning, and that is a big, big secret for us. Follow my MACD times, perhaps you see what can be seen... But that is another theory, another system, another EA. With this theory, the pip potential from the entry at 07.10 was 130 pips (your 32 + 100 bevore), but now can I not report about, I must further programming.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Mrkam, This thread has become a little confusing lately, so I want to see exactly where we are right now. I have a few questions for you about your trading strategy if you don't mind... please take a look at the attached chart from Thursday and Friday and let me know if I have understood your trading method correctly. This is an example of a trade that could have been taken according to the system we have here. To identify what's on the shown H1 chart: The blue line is the closing price line of USDCHF and the red line is EURUSD. The yellow verticals are entry and exit times. The blue line is created by the indicator NeutralHedge Overlay_v3 and the indicator window shows NeutralHedge osc_v3.3. The entry could have been taken on this trade at any time several hours before or after the time I picked and would have affected the gain substantially. I just chose an entry point from the area where the threshold was exceeded. However, I choose the closing point to be when the lines crossed. I'm not sure if this is the point when the correlation is zero or not. I'm not sure if it matters anyway. I'm not sure if this would be the best place to exit trades either, in general. Looking back you can see that by staying with this trade you would have continued to be making gains even up to the end of the chart (of course that would have been unknown at the time), so would you have decided to stay in after the crossing? These are some things I'm not clear about and I hope you can answer: Do you exit at the crossing lines? Or are you closing the trades at a set pip profit amount? Would that amount be the pip difference I am showing in on the chart in this case (~160 pips) or do you have a way to determine a pip value to exit at? I think you mentioned in an earlier post that you trade GBPJPY... Is there some particular reason for choosing that pair? Which other pair are you using to complete your hedge trade with GBPJPY? Have you tried other pair combos that would work well? Note: On this chart it is not clear, but at the time the trades were to be placed the osc_v3.3 threshold value was about 50 if I recall. Also, depending on when the trade was entered a stop of at least 100 pips would have been required to allow the price to move against you before getting into profit. This also must be considered. I hope this is not too many questions, but I want to fully understand the method or I won't be able to be sure about the results I get when I test it. I would like to have some definite rules to follow to see what kind of results I can get under all conditions with this. With most systems there is too much discretion required which leads to uncertainty. I'm hoping to test this as mechanically as possible so it can help us all. If you could post a chart of one of your recent trades it would be very helpful too. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi.. PistolDave....good post I agree... I must say I am getting totally lost ...mainly the terms being used are confusing...divergence is one.. I am wondering if its possible while answering Dave's question is it possible to run thru a recent trade giving numbers and entry point and just leave off the indicators...there has to be a simpler way to explain all this.. eg...% change...off dailies...what numbers we looking for on all 3 pairs at the time of entry.... also something I just noticed on Dave's chart is that there is a "buy eur" and a "sell chf".....I thought it was suppose to be ....a Buy Buy or sell sell.......not a buy and sell

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi, Pistol Dave, You cannot make the trades as the indicator says sell USDCHF, buy EURUSD! You are not hedged! It's like you buy 2 lots of EURUSD. Remember that EU and UCHF are inversely corelated, sothe correct trade might be sell both or buy both..... We have to ask SWINGMAN to correct the error in this indi, so the overlay chart to be in the mirror (to spot the decorelation) and the second one not to show that comment. I'm using other pairs too, they are GBPUSD/USDCHF, GBPUSD/EURUSD, NZDUSD/AUDUSD, AUDUSD/AUDJPY, GBPJPY/USDJPY, GBPJPY/EURJPY

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi dragosd1, I agree. That's where the confusion is. This thread started out as being about the hedging method explained in the first few posts. Then it got less and less clear what this is all about. Maybe we can get it sorted out. The indicator on the chart can show positive or negative correlation of the same pairs. In other words, the way I had it in the first chart is like you have both EURUSD and USDCHF price graphs on the same chart. On the one below it will show the EU properly oriented but with the UC inverted so you can see the "spread" between them. I am attaching the same chart with the indicators inverted from before so you can see the difference. That's why I was asking those questions of mrkam. You are right, if that is the way it is being used it is not hedging. The indicators, used in that way, are showing a possible way to trade two pairs by profiting from a type of divergence. Personally, I don't care if it's divergence, hedging, or whatever as long as there's a way to make money from it. What we do need to know is if what I showed is the way mrkam is using it and what the exact method is. We will wait for his reply. SpeilersHedge EA is being developed by Swingman now to be able to able to capture profits using a proper hedging strategy if I'm right. He said he would be able to correct the problems with the EA by Monday and I'm sure he will have it working soon. So we have that to look forward to. Good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi... Another point I am not sure about is this Market Neutral idea of placing an order using 1.5 lots of CHF.. Would not this be based on pip values and as such EUR is $1.00 and CHF is $0.98 how much more balanced can it get....But again maybe I'm misreading something. Maybe Swigman as he is doing the the EA and such can shed more light on all this..

--- 帖子 #289 ---
You are right here! A truly "neutral hedge" is 1 lot EU vs 1.61 lot UCHF (the simplest way is to take the EURCHF value) so you are neutral vs USD notional value. I really don't know which is the better and the most correct approach in this matter, 1/1 lots or 1/1.61 lots. I'm using both but i'm still not sure which is correct. Ex. GBPJPY vs. USDJPY I use 1/1 lots, but taking into consideration a neutral hedge you have to use 1/2 lots. Anyway, in Spieler's strategy we use a different approach, since we speculate a directional movement of EURCHF. Some people would make a triangular hedge like buy EU/UCHF/ECHF at the same time. I did this last night, before market closes and in 30 mins they were like 700 USD up, with 1 lot each.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi all ! That´s something I don´t understand. With the original method of this thread aren´t we supposed to trade same amount for each pair ? I have demo traded and live traded (small positions) this method and i think it is okay, when pipvalue is the same (like gbpjpy 1pip=1$ / eurjpy 1pip=1$). That way you know how much you are gonna make from the start. When devergence or delta is 100 pips you will be +100 when it gets back to zero. If we entered different size positions we would still be +100pips but the money made would depend on the movement of the traded pairs. For example GBPJPY +130 and EURJPY -30 it would be bad if the eurjpy position is bigger. I hope that´s making any sense! English is not my mothertongue so it´s a bit difficult to express what i mean.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
That's the way i use it! I'm sure SWINGMAN will do a great job with the EA!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi PistolDave! a few things to go through..... Good discussion. Perhaps one step to bringing some focus back is that the Spieler method now has it's own thread, which I will be following! That should help a lot. Also, the way I am approaching this is not exactly the original way as well, but I think still in keeping with the concept.... Speaking of which, Drago has it right, this is NOT a hedge strategy. In fact, we don't want it to be an exact hedge, in order to get our movement, hence our profit. I mentioned this in some extent in an earlier post. We WANT the non-hedging, the non-correlation, or out of Sycnch, as I call it. (I don't want to use the common terms hedge, or correlation, because it introduces this confusion... hence I am using "Synch"...) But, we do take advantage of the hedged nature of these particular SynchPairs... (or pairs of pairs.) I am working the GU/EU, GJ/EJ, and GU/UChf ... Other would work, as has been posted. I primarily am working iwth the GUEU because of the pip to pip simplicity. As already mentioned, we are not trying to create a neutral hedge, so I trade lot for lot, no correlation factor... but this could be an area to work. I am seeing good trades just trading lot for lot, and is simpler, and since I like simple, I will stay with that approach for now! Technically, we are really trading price action. If we set the difference between the two market prices, we will see that they move further and closer apart, in some sort of regularity, sort of like a pendulum. I believe SwingMans "Neutral Hedge Oscillator" series of indicators provide a workable way to visualize this movement. (More on those later, but the name is sort of a mis-nomer... again, we really don't have, and don't want, a "neutral hedge"...) Yes, as you have illustrated the trade in your screenshot is precisely how I am working this. The Oscillator indicator shows how the prices move away from each other, then closer to each other, and which to buy and which to sell. Very nicely. We have to be sure the indicator does not repaint, which I think has been confirmed. I much prefer v3.3 to v3.1. v3.1 requires that you update the date input in order to keep the indicator current. v3.3 stays current. There are a couple of things to work out in order to trade these. 1) how far back do you set the indicator to show, and 2) where to enter the trade. I have dealt with 2) in some length earlier. I am looking at a conservative exit (when the indicator hits or crosses "zero") and an agressive exit, when the indicator hits our Trigger on the OTHER side of zero, and always-in, stop and reverse sytstem. For 1), I am finding that a setting of 205 or thereabouts on v3.3 works for me. (you have to use a different number for v3.1 to get it to match, but if you put both on the chart, then adjust, you can get them both to match). I like to see at least the 4 most recent "cycles". From there, you can pick an entry threshold, or trigger point. For testing, you can sit and watch, or work with bar closes. As time goes on, you can pick an entry time on the hourly chart by "entering" at the close of a candle whose indicator bar is above (or below) the trigger. Since you are at a close, it is easy to check the charts (GU and EU, say) and get your entry price. Then, you look for the close of the candle whose indicator bar crosses the 0 line, and get those two close prices as exit point. Get your profit/loss, subtract your TWO spreads , and you have your trade. You are also correct that we need a stoploss. I have addressed this as well, calling it my MaxLoss. It happens VERY rarely, but it DOES happen!! (I have a 75K loss to attest to this!!!) Currencies WILL reset their correlation at some point. In other words, they will NOT return to zero, but may go out of correlation hundreds of pips for a long time! When this happens, we HAVE to simply get out. And wait for the cycle to re-establish itself, which also WILL happen. We can do this with a maxloss, the total net loss of our two trades. This is the virtual drawdown we have to be able to sustain on the way to the close of the trade. We don't want it to be too much, or we may take a big loss. We don't want it to be too little or we will cut our trades short for losses, when they would be wins. I have found a level of 2 times the trigger delta to be acceptable for me, and we haven't even gotten close to it in the month or so I have been working specifically with these indicators. So, if we enter at 80, I set my max loss at 160. The entry is simply an indexed number, calculated by the indicator, and my maxloss setting is in $$, so I set it at $160 per .1 lot traded (in this example). Lots of rambling, sorry, but hopefully this is helpful to advance the discussion!

The problem I have with both the overlay indicators and the oscillators is that they do repaint- in a way. It's not true repainting but they reposition every time the starting bar is advanced. Sometimes there is only almost no difference, sometimes there is a lot of difference. There are critical junctures where changing the starting date and time by just a small amount, gives an entirely different picture. If there was a way to pin down the starting time so the past wave shapes do not change as new data comes in, we could have confidence in what we are looking at. I don't know if that's possible. I'm sure SwingMan can tell us.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Swingman, Would you mind posting the mq4 file for your indicator? I like to see how things are calculated and be able to analyze an EA code for accuracy and to see exactly what's happening before allowing a peice of code to trade for me. If you are providing these to forum members anyway, the code would help. Plus more eyes may catch any quirks that would make the system or indicator work wrong.

You can overlay Pairs on the Dailyfx . com free charting package. Go to the website http://www.dailyfx.com/charts/ChartStation.html Select Charts Select Instruments from the menu Choose pair, and new. set timeframe. While that chart is high lighted select instrument again Pick pair and choose overlay. Trade Well... Brent

I am sorry, but when I post the source code, you can find in two weeks on eBay the perfect hedge system, or can get it for a donation, because it free... It's happened several times, and I do not like. If anyone understood the ideas of the system, they can each program or hire someone to do. With the buggs I have come to cope, many thanks!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Yes BillSS, I know what you mean... for sure if we change the # of bars or the date the whole pattern changes... v3.3 eliminates the date variable, and has an input for the past # of bars we can see, which is great.... but we need to keep the # of bars the SAME over time, or else we won't have anything consistent to trade.... What I am going to do next week is start writing down the value of the most recent closed bar, and it's time, pretty much anytime I am in front of a chart at the bar close. Then, track those bars through time it see if the values change, and if so, by how much. This sytem can "absorb" a little bit of change, I would say no more than 10%, which is a lot! If a current Osc bar hits say 110, and my entry is 80... and that bar "repaints" to 100 a few hours or days later, then no biggee... but if a bar closes at 30, and ends up at 140 a few hours or days later, then BIG problem... I don't think we need pristing accuracy to work this method, but we do need consistency. Once we have that, we can trade it! I'll post how my "bar tracking" goes... hmmmm "bar tracking"... that gives me another idea, but it has to do with scotch....????

--- 帖子 #298 ---
You see marked changes when the progressing start time hits a news release. I don't know the formula for the indicator, but it reorients itself and gives a completely different picture. If the overlay and oscillator worked directly on pure price difference in the two pairs, that would fix it. If the start time was permanently set and did not increment, that would fix it. Again, SwingMan knows what is possible.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Now I am at the program and do not have much time to think. I have observed that the indicator v4 sometimes repaintet. He has the advantage that the situation in the past remains unchanged. For trading decisions may be better to take the v3 indicators. mrkam When I have time to do small analyses, I take the opens of the bars. It should be, because common the trading programs take trading decisions at the open of the bars.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
V4 repaints but the past does not change? I don't understand.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks for the explanation mrkam. That makes it clearer for me now. I had run into one or two trades in the past week that didn't work out like I expected so I wasn't sure if I was on the right track. I had one trade that was stopped out because I had set the stop at only 100 pips when, as you say, it should be about 2x the trigger delta. Also, I was setting the v3 period to only about 72 which is too short of time to see the extremes that the price can go out of synch. If you set the period too short you may think price has reached an extreme by looking at the indicators but it may still have a lot farther to go before it starts swinging back. The key to profiting from this system then, as I understand it, is to be able to anticipate when the prices have swung out to their recent "normal" extremes and then try to enter and wait for them to swing back to the other extreme. And also as you have pointed out you can trade conservatively, agressively, or in the "always in" mode. This method, coupled with stop orders to protect against out of the normal movement, can possibly provide a profitable strategy overall. I'll be testing it on demo. pd

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi PD, precisely! We still need to iron a few things, but overall, I am optimistic... One thing to noodle, maybe, (BillSS!!) I have an EA (I paid a programmer to do it for me....) that trades this system purely on price differences between the two currencies, no indicators. The formula for the delta is MarketCurr1 - MarketCurr2 - ZeroFactor = Delta. ZeroFactor is just a number to adjust the two currencies to "zero". This was basically designed around trading the GU/EU pairs. The trick is how to define "zero"!!! The indicators do, somehow, either the oscilator or the overlaid line charts. Say we have such a zero point, and at that point, say the GU is 1.9886, and the EU at that same time is 1.5893. The straight mathematical difference is .3793. If I manually set the ZeroFactor to .3793, then my Delta is Zero. Then, I set my TriggerDelta (point at which I would enter trades) at, say 100. So, whenever the difference betweed the two currency PRICES gets to 100, I enter. Whenever the difference in Currency PRICES gets to Zero (after being adjusted by the ZeroFactor), I exit. Kind of the same concept, but no indicators, just prices.... So how to set Zero??? Any ideas!!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I can't program MT4 but I can and do work with AmiBroker. I have been working on exactly the same concept you describe with the same basic formula.. And, yes, getting the Zero factor figured out is a problem. One thing I have found- using Bollinger Bands to identify the deviation extremes (thresholds) works well- touching the bottom band signals a long spread- the top signals a short. It's quick and easy and seems to work. If I get it like I want it, I'll try to get someone to convert AmiBroker code to MT4.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi SwingMan ! First of all thank you very much for participating in this very interesting thread. Could you explain in some sentences how to read your indicator ? (especially the marked trading levels) Thanks in advance Bernhard

--- 帖子 #306 ---
mrkam, SwingMan, billbss, Any ideas!! How to set Zero! I am not very good in math or formulas. Neither am I a programmer. Having said that I do have an idea how to maybe set Zero…. BillSS mentioned about the use of Bollinger Bands to identify the deviation extremes (thresholds). Ok. Then how about using this indicator (SHI_Channel_true)attached below to set a dynamic Zero? You attach the indicator (SHI_Channel_true (setting 89)) to the Daily Charts of GBPUSD and EURUSD. Now you take the center point of the SHI Channel for EURUSD and subtract it from the center point of the SHI Channel for GBPUSD. Which would give you the straight mathematical difference of 0.#### …. Then you set the ZeroFactor to 0.####, then your Delta is Zero. And from that set your TriggerDelta. Just an idea… Then this becomes a dynamic Zero which would adjust daily reflected by both the GBPUSD and the EURUSD… What do you think. Mrkam, billss., and SwingMan? Bruce

Hi.... I dont think these systems have been tested long enough to be starting to add indictors... Can we keep this thread clean....by that I mean stick to the basic syetem But if someone has an alternative idea...maybe starting another thread.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
No, in MT4 isn't possible to realize this idea, because the name: "BrucechsHedge_DynamicZeroChannel_vXX" is too long!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
welllll..... we don't really have a "system" to test, yet!! Although I think the NeutralHege Oscillator approach bears some testing, as it has been kind of a basis for one of the approaches... I like the SHI channel, because it is price action based... I LOVE price action...!! Cool suggestion, and worthy of investigation! i need to look at it some more, and nice idea of maybe a daily adjustment of the zero point, sort of what Speiler does, daily, but in a different way. I need to see how the math works out, with respect to my Sych EA.. your reference to the 0.xxxx adustment... THANKS (brucech) for the post! So maybe this is more of a "think tank" thread at his point, that will lead to specific approach offshoot threads?? (liek the Spieler thread?) But I agree, we are sort of lacking a sense of focus, which we all have mentioned... but sometimes, it take the brainstorming think-tank approach to develop focus... Ah well, whatever it is, it sure is fun!! mk

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Every indicator you see on this thread is an addition. If you want to keep it clean you need to go back and work off of post#1.- a chart. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...77&amp;postcount=1 If we followed your suggestion, this would now be three separate threads, the original, one for the overlay and another for the oscillator.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
That might work. I don't know enough about the Shi channel. Isn't it from the old Overeasy System? It looks a lot like a linear regression channel. I'm working from a little different angle. I'm looking for deviations between the combined spread and the cross pair. When you find one- it ALWAYS corrects and does so quickly.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
No problem Swingman - I just wanted to know exactly how you are calculating the INDICATOR not EA. I don't care about EA's. I built one using that formula that is close, but not exactly. If you don't care who has indicator, why do you care about the code behind it? Not critisizing, just asking. For example, my indicator and yours are exactly the same on a daily chart but not on an hourly chart using the following formula double d = (100 * Close[i] / iClose(NULL,PERIOD_D1,i+1)) - 100; ExtMapBuffer1[i] = d; and using this code - everything is way off. double d = (100 * iClose(NULL,PERIOD_D1,i) / iClose(NULL,PERIOD_D1,i+1)) - 100;

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Well.... got a bunch to report from the overnight swings.... Osc Indicator v3.3: indeed this does repaint!! As the bars "fall off" of the front end (old bars), and new bars are added at the back end (most recent bars...), apparantly the calc changes the height of the bars.... Osc Indicator v3.1: On the other hand, I was able to confirm that this indicator does NOT repaint (at least the way I set it up....)!! When this one progresses, bars do not fall off the front of the indicator as new bars are added. If you check the value of the most recent closed indicator bar, it remains the same as more and more bars are added... but, with this one, you have to make sure the date is set correctly, or else new bars will not be added... Using the v3.3 bars, I had a couple trades pretty much break even, or small profit. Using the v3.1 bars, at a 7/14 0000 entry, and a 1100 close, cleared about 70 or so pips. This trade mirrored using the price differential logic, with a ZeroFactor set two ways 1) looking back on the Overlayv3 indicator to where the lines cross, and calc the Zero factor from that, and 2) using the SHI indicator at open of new day 0000 on the HOURLY chart. Both were with about 30 of each other.). Then, close at Delta = 0. This netted about +70 p as well. So, from here, I will be working the 3.1 indicator, but just setting it for the week and letting it go, no adjustments, as they would change the bar values. And.... the price differential appoach, re-setting the ZeroFactor per the SHI at each new day, on hourly. We will see!! REV: Added screenshot per below request, although it doesn't really do us much good, which is why I didn't post it in the first place. The logic and aprpoach is described above. The Trade was taken automatically by my EA, but not closed when it should have been, (bug to work out...) so I closed it manually close to the zero point, (a bit on the other side.). You see the results of the two trades, and you can do the math for the net profit. You can also see the correspondance with the v3.1 Oscillator indicator, set up as described above, no changes once setup. On another chart, I traded the v3.1 EA, and it traded it fine, same basic results within a pip or two. Again, we are REALLY early in these approaches, very experimental at this point... but worthy of pursuing in my mind!!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
mrkam, Could you post your charts to show how "This netted about +70 p"? Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I guess we can figure out the zero factor from EUR/GBP movement..same as Spieler looking for EUR/CHF movement before entering EUR/USD and USD/CHF..I am not sure ...all i know is when EUR/GBP goes down (GBP become stronger than EUR) Long GBP/USD will be beat short EUR/USD. The hedge will be broken up until 60 pips....just like happen today...

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi, Mrkam, It is possible to post your Ea here, I would like to test it, as now I test Spielers EA. The graphical overlay is drawn by the EA, or is "AllUSDpairs" indi?

Here is a shot of where I entered on the EURUSD vs USDCHF and another trade on the GBPUSD vs USDCHF hedge pair. Note the red vertical line marking the time I entered. Also see the vertical yellow line showing the price spread (threshold value) at the time of entry. The yellow x's are about the area price was at at entry on these charts. I also placed some horizontal blue lines that intersect with the price lines as they were on the chart at this time. I will post them again in a few hours and see if the price lines have changed position on the charts as we have suspected. I'm trying to see if this is an accurate real time prediction of the profit in pips that will result when the threshold reverts back to zero. If it is accurate then you could get an EA that would close the positions when the profit is at the amount predicted by the threshold value or more. As mrkam has mentioned, the tricky part is to determine this zero point. Anyway take a look at the charts and you will see the entry and the values for the threshold and what I am expecting as the profit from these trades. I'll post again soon with a view of what this has done after a few hours.

Hi ! I had a trade going on since yesterday 4:00 gmt (short EJ/long GJ 4hr). With a period ratio of 200 the "hedge range" was at about 210. exit today at range about 40 but only 80 pips profit (instead of 170 as i would have expected). I played a bit with the indicator and pairs and found out that it was absolutely accurate for EU/GU 4hr yesterday 0:00gmt (showed a range of 160 accurate to the pip +160 by the time range was zero). I really wonder what makes the difference there!! Also, The EJ/GJ range of 210 was shown on the GJ chart with EJ-overlay. When i switched to EJ-chart with GJ-overlay it was only 166 range. So I´m fine with the indis for EU/GU but I´d really love to knoe whats wrong with the yenpairs. any ideas anybody ??

Nobody ever claimed this is a "hedge" trade, at least in the traditional sense. But it IS two directional trades of two CORRELATED pairs. They are loosly "synched" each other, and it is exactly that VARIABLE synchronization we are trying to take advantage of. This has been our discussion for weeks now. GU/EU and GJEJ are Buy/Sell or Sell/Buy pairs, EU/UChf is Buy/Buy, Sell/Sell, both because of their positive or negative correlation. I think we all get that... And yes, PD, for some reason, the Yen pairs calc a bit oddly on the Oscillator... don't know way... I am concentrating on getting the GUEU to be consistent for now!!

mrkam now that you noted that the version 3.3 repaints will you write a new indicator or will use the version 3.1? after your message about the repaint inssue in the 3.3 i don't know wich version to test... thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yes, we are trying to come up with a non-repainting indicator... we'll see. The other thing we are doing is using the real-time indicator values for entry/exit, and testing for performance. The only thing the "past" bars do is allow us to back-check with more accuracy.. and of course it would be great if an indicator bar closed at value = 106, and it STAYED value = 106 through it's life on the indicator, but in reality, if the indicator is accurate in realtime, then it doesn't matter to the trading EA what happens as it ages. That is, if 106 is a good number, and we enter at 100, then we enter. If it goes to zero, and zero is a good number, then we exit. It doesn't matter if the entry bar repaints to 40, or 400 for that matter, we have executed the trade. Now, whether or not it will be consistently profitable, (or losing) is another matter!! and that is the testing I am looking at. But, it is not easy, still pre-beta with my EA, so I am not getting accurate trades yet on that end... It all takes time, and nothing to be rushed.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I agree. This trading strategy is quite different than the one that was described on the first posts as "Market-Neutral" hedge strategy. I don't know if you would even call this a hedge in that sense. More like a convergence/divergence of price between two pairs. Or correlation oscillation that is measured by the indicators on the chart. I'm not really sure at this point what to call it. But since it developed here, I'm testing it to see if it is profitable. The strategy that branched off from this thread that is more like a hedge is being developed on the thread at: "Hedge trading spieler system derived from futures spread trading" http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post2112581 They seem to be making some progress in that direction and SwingMan has developed an EA for trading it, but so far it hasn't worked that well for me. I am still testing both ways of trading and posting the results. What kind of results have you had with either strategy? pd

--- 帖子 #330 ---
See the chart below at 17:00 where the indicators crossed. I closed half of my position in EURUSD vs USDCHF at the hedgeRange = 0 point. I'm going to let the other half ride to see how far it will go. pd

Hi fewhills, I'm using NeutralHedge Overlay_v3 and NeutralHedge osc_v3.3 in this template. It also has an indicator iParamonWorkTime that makes those light colored bands that show the hours that the London opens/closes and the NY opens/closes. If you don't have that, don't worry it's not part of this anyway. pd

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Great! Thanks PistolDave.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I'm closing the first half of the GBPUSD vs USDCHF now at 00:00 time. HedgeRange is about zero in osc_v3.3 indicator window. As in the EURUSD vs USDCHF pairs, I will close this half and let the other half of this position run to see how far it will go.

hi PD, is there any specific number of hedgerange or treshold that indicate it is "good time" to enter the market? around +\- 300 maybe for hedgerange?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi Andrie, I'll try to explain what I consider a "good time" to enter a trade using this strategy and how to limit the risk. This is a trade I placed earlier today. Let's use it as an example. It is in profit about 70 pips in this chart below. The red vertical line is where I entered. Why did I enter there? Only because I happened to notice it earlier but I was busy with some other trading and I forgot about it. When I looked at it again it still was an acceptable trade to enter by the rules and so I jumped in. That shows that there is many times a "window" of opportunity to enter/exit with this method instead of a very specific time to get in and out. Allow me to give you some details about this setup... The HedgeRange (histogram) was about 240 at my entry point -- and now the HedgeRange is about 140. The difference in the pips is about 85 including bid/ask spread. So the price change and the HedgeRange are not exactly the same -- but they are close enough to give you a good sense about when to enter and exit. The Threshold is 163.5 More to the point of your question, there is no truly "exact" way to tell when is the best time to enter. It is more a matter of probabilites. But so far I have seen the edge is definitely in your favor if you do enter near the right time. Here is how I decide what is the right time: The value you set the Period_Ratio at determines the upper and lower boundaries of the channel (gold lines). This gives you a general idea of what kind of variation to expect from the prices over that period of time. I have mine set at 205 which gives you a reasonable range. So you have a good (not exact) idea of how much over the last 205 bars the prices have deviated in relation to each other. I haven't found any way to know with certainty how high/low the prices will go before they turn back, but that's where the Threshold helps you. You definitely don't want to take a trade until the HedgeRange histogram has gone outside the Threshold boundary, and the closer to the channel boundaries (gold lines) you can enter the less risk and more potential profit there is. So, that's it... Histogram outside the Threshold and price close to the channel boundaries. That's the way I see it. Wait for that setup and you will have the best R/R you can have in this system. That's about as specific as I can be at this time. Try it on a demo for some time and you should start to get a good sense about how far the price will go before it turns. (But be sure to place a stop, say about 100-150 pips away on each pair just in case. ) I know that's not a very exact answer for you, but I can't be too much more specific. This is a totally different method than what I've done before so I'm a learner too. PD

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Trading this method seems to be too tricky on yen pairs. I entered a trade today EUR/JPY GBP/JPY on the hourly chart hedge range was 130. Its 60 now but i´m down about 50 pips. And i´m sure i did enter the right direction ! Also i notice Oscillator v3.3 repainting because know i don´t see a hedge range of 130 anywhere anymore. I might keep with EU GU next time.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
This "repainting" or changing of the overlay line is the main problem with this system. I really hope we can find some way to overcome it. It would make this much better if you could be sure what you are seeing on the chart is exactly what was there a few days/hours before.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I have seen the same thing happening today with eurjpy gbpjpy

--- 帖子 #341 ---
PistolDave, the repainting could be avoided by using a starting time instead of Period_Ratio. Your 205 bars move along with every new bar. If a time could be set, this wouldn't happen. You would only have to change your starting time every now and then. Unfortunately the indicator doesn't give this possibility.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi everyone, I've interested in this strategy yesterday and today I've got nice profit and it works well. Just a question, is it possible to make sound alarm when oscillator is going near to 0 line, or to set up the value when it should ring. Then we could set up position and go away from the monitor, and wait for sound alarm when osc will be near 0 to close the position. Thanks a lot for the previous indicators, they are great. Sorry for my english. EDIT: I'm so impressed, today I've made 66 pips, and two positions still open (now +28pips and waiting for EUR/USD and GBP/USD to cross on 15min TF), EDIT #2: close another trade for + 40 pips. I'll be demoing it for the next week, now it looks great.

I'm so so so impressed with this system. Since 17.07.2008 afternoon till todays morning I've made +374 pips When pairs Hedge Range increasing I've add some position.

Is it possible to upgrade it with sound alarm when Hedge Range on oscillator will be at some level?

I like day trading and I'm using for this strategy M5 TF. I enter trades with minimal range of 25-30 pips on E/U G/U and U/CHF U/J. Period Ratio set up to 205 like PistolDave. Now I have L on E/U and S on G/U.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Bruce, and thanks. Great to see success examples! Nice applications, all of them. My efforts have been in two areas: 1. Modify the indicator to stop re-painting. My programmer (who is REALLY good), can't figure a way to do it... not to say it can't be done, we just can't do it. But all that means is that we can't "trust" the past bars, which only comes into play in back-checking. So the real question is does the REALTIME bar data provide consistent entry and exit points. Clearly, it does in the examples above, but is it consistent. I think it will be. Time will tell. 2. An EA for all of this. It has been slow going, and buggy, but just yesterday I got a new version and am testing. I have been quiet on this, as I won't be able to give it away for free, having over $300 invested in it, and am not sure what I am going to do. At least, we can discusss and help one another!! I have been trading mainly the 1 hr, but the time frame just affects how the indicator "looks", and since we don't really care about past bars, chart timeframe only affects the current value of the indicator. Our two prices, in real time, don't care how the past data is collected and represented. They are "x" pips apart, regardless of the chart!! But one can trade what he/she likes to see, and "shows" us good and consistent entry/exit points. All part of developing the concept!

OK... we might be getting somewhere here... on the screenshot below, note a few things: 1. 5m scalp, for a 9p profit, AFTER spreads , not bad. 2. The indicator repainted after the entry, making it look like a better trade than it was.... 3. But (per earlier) it doesn't matter, as we are not looking at the indicator for PAST results, but merely for entry/exit conditions. 4. One trade. Big Deal. But the math may just very well be consistent. And if so, we might have something.... Just for your consideration.....

Hi! I just had another repainting problem with EU/UC. Entered when range was 62 short/short on July 21. Range is back to zero know and I´m in profit like 4 pips or something. Also the indicator repainted and now my entry-candle had a hedgerange of only 10 instead of 62. This Repainting seems to matter , because at the entry i had range 62 and know I have 0.8 with a poor profit of 4 pips. I don´t understand the differences but it still seems to work best on EU/GU.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Mrkam, Maybe we can consider what fewhills says in #341: "PistolDave, the repainting could be avoided by using a starting time instead of Period_Ratio. Your 205 bars move along with every new bar. If a time could be set, this wouldn't happen. You would only have to change your starting time every now and then. Unfortunately the indicator doesn't give this possibility." I'm thinking that if you can create an EA that uses the osc_v1 (the one where you have to re-set the start date) and have it re-set it for you automatically then that might solve the problem. It's something to consider. What do you think? PD

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Please replace and test the indicators. I replaced the parameter "correlated" with "mirroring", like in the first versions... Alert is in v3.4 implemented. .

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thank you SwingMan for alarms upgrade, I'll test it in next days. Now we've got interesting situation because of strong trend on EUR/GBP, let's see how it will end.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Yes!! This may just be one of those "resetting" times where the correlation goes wacko for a bit, then re-settles into more of that "pendulum" pattern we we are trying to take advantage of. Even then, there is a give and take between the two pairs, still offering opportunity, if we can identify and manage.... very interesting stuff.... and just as a note, v3.4 still repaints, but the multi-level alarms might be nice!!

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Zeusjoes' method of trading this may be the simplest and best way. He told how he did it in his first two or three posts. He opened up a long G/J and a short EJ on a demo platform and kept them open.. He watched the "Profit" column to judge when they were out of correlation and traded accordingly. That's about as simple and direct as you can get. Maybe an indicator that could give a graphic picture of that profit or loss. There would be no repainting. It would be possible to go back historically and determine thresholds.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
This is also interesting, someone could say that L on EU and S on GU is the same as L on EUR/GBP. Look at screen below and one on my previous post. Value of EUR/GBP is the same but sum of EU and GU is significantly different.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
That's a very good option and maybe the only way to have an accurate entry.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
billbss, I'm beginning to think that may be the simplest and best way to trade this. I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the indicators that repaint. I really never know when to enter or exit. I agree, you would have to be able to determine some reasonable thresholds to give you an idea when to enter. I am still optimistic that this can be a profitable strategy to trade. PD

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Bliss, I had been thinking the same thing. I have tried to get several people to try and change this indicator so instead of actually showing live trades going on at the same time, the user could put in the variables-- starting date, ending date, currency pairs, direction traded, lot size --then see over that time what it would have done. But haven't been able to find anyone to do it yet. Any programmers want to take on that challenge?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I just did a rough volatility comparison of GBP/JPY vs EUR/JPY. ATR 1000 on G/J is 39.6 pips on the 1H chart. ATR 1000 for E/J is 26.08 pips. To normalize these pairs for a spread, I would trade 1 G/J lot to every 1.52 E/J lots. I will open 1 long G/J and 1.52 long E/J on a demo. I'll watch the separations change in the profit column. I'll watch it for the next day and see if I can find a pattern for a max before it starts closing back. Once I've found some reasonable numbers, I'll trade it for a few days and see how it works. I did this a few weeks ago and it seemed to work. I think we'll find out that something along these lines is the best way to trade this.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Tomorrow or the next day I will have an indicator that does this: (but it is costing me $125... anybody want to share!!! The more folks, the cheaper it is!!! Not looking to make money, only to share the costs for shared benefit.) 1. Input Curr1 and Curr2. 2. Calc and plot the difference (Delta) between the two prices, tick by tick, indicator bar stops at start of new chart candle, Curr1-Curr2. Will not repaint because the value of the closed bar is simply the difference in close values of the individual currency candles, which do not change. 3. Look back N number of bars (input selectable) and determine the high and low of the oscillator bars plotted by #2. 4. Calc the "Zero Line" by (Hi + Lo)/2 . This would be a line halfway between the low Delta and the High Delta of the set time period. One month back would be about 20 daily bars, or about 480 hourly bars, or... you get the idea. You can customize the period by the chart you have. One could either trade hi to lo, or low to hi, (at a given # of pips away from hi or low). Or one could enter at say 20p below the hi, or 20p above the low, and exit at the ZeroLine (conservative.) This indicator will be STRICTLY price based. No calcs, no repainting. Should have tomorrow or the next day, I will test from there. Once I verify proper functioning, I will show potential entry/exit points and resulting trades. This is what I have been trying to do with these indicators, but as mentioned above, the repainting is too squirly... although it (my EA based on NeutralHedgeOscillator) still has worked for me.. (3 wins today, totalling about 65p, on the 30m GU/EU ....) Strictly price action.. that's what I am after. Even with the drop in the EURGBP, no problem with this indicator because it will only show the DIFFERENCE in the prices. If both drop the same, the Delta remains the same, evens the whole thing out. It will remove the market movements, and focuse solely on the Synch between the pairs, as they move closer or farther apart from each other, with no concern to individual trending... Now, you can see the next step if this functions as I expect... anybody want to share in that?!?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I'll share. PM me the details of how to get the money to you.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
SwingMan, You've done a tremendous amount of work on this project. Why don't you open a PayPal account. I'm sure a lot of us would like to show our appreciation. I know I would.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Great!! have 3 or 4 interested, and probably a few more. How's $20 sound?? (I'll post paypal details after I am sure it works... and post examples here for you all to see and decide...) I have the indicator now, and will be testing today. If I don't get too busy at "work" here, I will post some example screenshots.... Next step will be the EA. I have the logic, and the programmer. Again, once the indi is where I (we) want it, I will task him with the EA. Maybe we all can share with that too??? Thanks for the interest... mk

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Greetings, First post after reading for a couple of years, as this seems to me to be a great way of trading. Swingman nice indicatiors, you seem to be a good programmer. Maybe to help Pistol Dave and others, here is my suggestion on how to enter and exit uncorrelated pairs. When your currency pairs show separation with the NeutralHedge Overlay indicator look to the cross pair. The cross pair should be hitting or have crossed the upper or lower Bollinger Band (20,2). Wait for MACD (5,13,1) to change momentum. When it does then enter the uncorrelated pairs in the proper directions. Example of yesterdays to todays trade below. In this example when the EURUSD and GBPUSD on 15min began to separate look to the EURGBP 1hr. When the MACD changed momentum time to enter EURUSD long and GBPUSD short. Exit when NeutralHedge Overlay crosses on EURUSD 15min. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD short at 1.9999 exit at 1.9856 (1.9860 with spread) = +139 pips EURUSD long at 1.5709 exit at 1.5681 (1.5879 with spread) = - 30 pips Total is 109 pips I took this trade, albeit I entered and exited bit early, and made 74 pips. MACD used in pics: Settings: 5,13,1 Attached File(s) 3 Colour Macd.mq4 4 KB | 417 downloads Bollinger Bands setting is 20,2 - the Metatrader default NeutralHedge Overlay_v3 Period_ratio setting at 205 Note - as I write this the NeutralHegde Overlay uncrossed as it repainted however profit was made. I don't think the repaint will effect the entry as you are using the cross pair to time the entry.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
OK.... I have to run, but wanted to post this for discussion. I have confirmed that this indicator works the way I want. 1) Input # of bars back to consider... screenshot shows ~ 2 weeks of hourly bars. 2) Indicator bars plotted are a DIRECT difference in currency prices, GU/EU here. 3) The green line is the halfway point between the current hi and low prices for the time frame on the indicator. 4) It does not (should not!!) repaint. You will see that it clearly shows the PRICE ACTION (with no calcs) of the two currencies as they move closer together, further apart, and back again. This is EXACTLY what we are trying to capitalize on, using direct price action... Leterally, we can trade this indicator, no need to see the individual charts. Nice and clean. I like that!! For your noodling now... After I get time to look a bit more, I can post a PayPal to help pay for this thing.... probably $20 would do it..

--- 帖子 #373 ---
One more before I have to take off.... TRADE EXAMPLE on the GU/EU SynchPair, 15m..... I am using closes of bars for this example. This is PRICE only trading, so "should" be a good example. (i.e., no repainting....) One idea of how to trade this....

--- 帖子 #374 ---
MRKAM !!! Count me in for sharing

--- 帖子 #375 ---
OK, found something "lacking".... The SynchBar indicator does a GREAT job (so far!!) of showing how the currencies move with relation to each other. What it does NOT do, (and I thought in might, with the ZeroLine), is show us WHICH direction to trade on each pair. On the example above, the Sell GU/Buy EU was want worked to get the profit. HOWEVER, it is interesting to note that the SwingMan indicators each said different things, maybe because of repainting. I will need to observe in realtime... The Oscillator Indi was correct, told us to "SELL GU", which was the profitable trade. REVISED: (See NEW chart below): I had the wrong setting on the Overlay, which made it say Buy GU.... I manually set the Mirroring to NO, and the new chart appeared, which CLEARLY shows Sell GU and Buy EU for both SwingMan indicators. I think this may work great for trade direction determination, with the SynchBar giving us the entry/exit timing.... So, SynchBar only gives us PART of the picture. Maybe we can use the Oscillator Indi ONLY for trade direction?? What to you all think. Is there a better way to tell buy or sell? Can we modify SynchBar to show us? (preferrable, then we only need one indi....) Any ideas?? Open for suggestions. If you all want a copy of this, you can PayPal me $20 usd and I will email to you right away. I will include any updates for free as we develop this together... Hopefully, we will get enough participation to fund this, and with all of our "synergy" we will succeed!! you can pp me at markkamrath"at"yahoo"dot"com. (Please don't email me there, it is just for PayPal... You can PM me here for any communication if you want. Keep in mind you need charts for BOTH currencies open, in the timeframe(s) that you want to use in order for the Indi to get it's data, but you only need to put the Indi on ONE chart.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
PS: Am I getting to far away from the original thread concept?? i.e., Should I start a new thread?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
No. This is closer to the original concept than anything we've done. Zeusjoes used raw price differences.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
In summary Zeusjoes writing about selling overperformance pair and buying underperformance pair. Indicators show this, so I think this is good thread. But where is Zeusjoes????

--- 帖子 #379 ---
He left us a long time ago.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi mrkam, There got alot of bar (almost same high). How you determine or confirm the entry point is follow red line bar? Please advice. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
FXFORCE has posted a couple of indicators that determine the relative strength of the individual currencies. It might be a good idea to start this indicator when the currencies in question show parity. We can determine that by looking back at his indicator.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi billbss, May i know what is FXFORCE (name?) Thanks.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I've done something in Excel, this are 59 M5 bars for EU/GU. All indicators repainting because they are build like I build it in Excel, cumulative number of bars range. We need indicator, in which we can set date from which range bars will be calculated. But what time it should be? Different times, different market picture. But there will also be different entry and exit points, so this is very interesting. There could be also this situation, that if we set time e.g one week ago and calculate the bars, then we could have exit signal (line cross e. g.) but if we set time to 2 weeks ago, then we could get entry signal because of interesting wide spread between two pairs. Most important then will be exit at the same time set, as entry.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
OK... here is where our discussion can really be valuable. My indicator is just that, an indicator. I want to start REALLY simple, and work from there. Now, we can "see" the currencies move closer and further apart. We can start to build a method to capitalize on this movement. Several questions need to be addressed: 1) Whether to buy or sell a particular currency. 2) When to enter.. .as mentioned above, there is a whole string of "long" bars showing us the prices are far apart. We can look back as far as we want with the indicator and see how this distance relates to the past. Since they are "far" apart, we have a greater probabilty that they will now move "closer", so it is THAT probability that we trade. If we enter, and they move farther apart, that is our risk, and our virtual Drawdown. We should have a stop in place because ALL correlations WILL breakdown, and re-establish themselves at some point. But as it moves further apart, generally, we have increased probability of the gap closing. Specifically, on the above note, with a whole lot of long bars, it says to me the currencies have "settled" a bit, and that they "probably" won't shoot off further apart. Kind of like a pendulum. The have "swung" apart, and now sort of hanging up, ready to swing back to the middle, or back to shorter bars. I would see that as a good place to enter. 3) When to exit. We can exit at the Zero Line, or wait for the bars to "swing" to the shorter side. I see the ZeroLine as a conservative exit, and the Shorter side as a more aggressive exit. Or we can exit at a fixed profit, whatever you think you want to go for... (again, all has to be developed.) My personal approach from here will be: 1) Try to determine a method for an entry threshold. If you look at the indicator, with some past history, and sort of scrunch your eyes, you can sort of "feel" a good entry area... 2) I will exit at ZeroLine. 3) Work on a method for determinining which to buy, which to sell. I will start with the NeutralHedgeOscillator indicator. It repaints, but I am not using it for the length of the bars, only the color... BillSS mentions some other indicators. We all can contribute here. This perhaps will be toughest part of this method..... 4) Work with only the GU/EU SynchPair right now... (I like simple!!) Thanks all for your support and help. I still think this is a unique approach, not tried by many, and certainily not addressed with custom indicator/EA programming to date.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
OK, last example for me.... then I will let you guys talk!! (I've been a thread hog recently!!) Here is another example, taken on the "short bar" end of things, and using the SwingMan indicators for trade directions... 15m chart, quick 29p net profit!

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Please look at this: Idea is to have trade opportunity all the time. Only what we have to do is to changing time when start the calculation. Look at pictures below, first calculation start from 12:35 GMT+1 for M5 candles. Values of each point are differences between O-C (+ digit if candle up, - digit if down) then they are add to previous one and so on, hope you get it. So in first picture we've got opportunity to SELL EU and BUY GU and it's correct. Here is the trick, if we start calculate values in different point in time (in second picture it's 15:10 GMT+1), then picture of the market is completely different and now we've got opportunity to BUY EU and SELL GU which is also correct (I know that the spread between pairs is small but it's only example). That could means that always are trading opportunities, and the trick is to find the best starting time for calculations. And entry end exit must be at the same calculation time. So if it will work, then we don't have to search different currancies but only different time. Hope it's understand, sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #387 ---
We are on the same track!!! Working to find a way to represent the corresponding price movements of two currencies. Your approach of plotting the difference between open and close for each currency is really interesting! You end up with a chart of the MOVEMENT of each currency over the 5m time period. I think I can get this coded! But, I need to think about the calcs a bit more... Would it be possible for you to post a link to your spreadsheet, or PM me for my email, and email it to me?? This is very interesting. A different way of looking at the same thing. The SynchBar indicator shows this price relationship as well, also in a very simple way, but needs another way to determine which to buy and sell. I need to see how you plot your data, where to start your series, etc... thanks for the idea....

hello Swingman, Thanks for your great indicators.Where can I get your price idifference indicator thays on your last post 389, thanks and cheers Dave

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I've completed yesterdays calculation till todays morning, and here it is what I've got. It looks that the spread between pairs is not so important. I've randomly selected some points and sometimes when spread was about 25 pips, gain on cross was 6 pips. But when spread was about 60 pips, then gain was about 85 pips. So sometimes gain is bigger then spread, sometimes smaller. I don't know what relationship cause it. But what is important, it looks that there is no possibility to loose if we get transaction in some spread, and then on cross (it seems) we will always have some profit (maybe because of it not repainting). Relaying on that will be some cross in the the future. One more thing for Overlay, or SwingMan's indicators which are great (I've made over 500 pips in 5 days with maximal drawdawn about 140 pips). Sometimes when we see some good spread for transaction, then on cross we could loose. In my strategy I've add position when the first is loosing about 15-20 pips, then wait what happen. If next position loosing then wait for 15-20 pips loose and add next position and so on. My record 14 open positions (7 long, 7 short) because of early entry. And then your next positions will cover the lost from first transactions.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
magic can you please port some charts and the indicators that you are using for this. to keep adding position averages every 20 pips or so... are not paying too much spread/slippage for each trade?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
For Excel it was not indicator, just manually I've add difference between open and close of each 5 minute candle on EU and GU. Then I've made cumulative series and here is the chart. On previous page is link to spreadsheet. I've made summary from monday, I've earn 358 pips in 74 transactions using NeutralHedge indicator by SwingMan.. Is it good or bad result? For me it's very good.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
which indicator you using from swingman - as there were some that were repainting. Yes that seems the logical thing that you have done on the spreadsheet, I will download and take a look at that.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I use NeutralHedge Overlay_v3 and NeutralHedge osc_v3.4 with very usefull alarms. I trade basically on EU/GU and UCHF/UJ on M5 TF, sometimes on M15. I'm waiting for about 30 pips HedgeRange, and then as mention earlier I build up my positions. PeriodRatio is set to 205 as PistolDave has it.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
We can use DDE and extract this information from MT4 rather than inputting it manually - what do you think?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Live streaming of data from MT4 to selected cells in Excel of every selected time frame will be good. I don't have possibility to use different program, cause I'm not a programmer and I don't know how to do it simpler I don't know is this way of comparing two pairs is better from what we have now, but we could test it. If we have time, close prices and no repainting then it is easy to do the backtest. And one more clue for smaller timeframes, the best way to compare candles will be close price - previous close price because of sometimes opening 2-3 pips gaps. On larger timeframes it is not so big difference.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I will send you a quick link, I am looking for it now.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
right ok - http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...02008%208:28pm this from brians rollover strat - on forex discussion forum. a guy called hornet (michael) created this spreadsheet that extracts the info from MT4 using DDE. I do not know much about programming excel, but this could be a start?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I supposed this question is answered somewhere, but this thread grew too big =D. So, i'm used to Long/Short strategies like this one in the stock exchange... usually do a couple per month. But on Forex e was afraid that egtting short at EU and long at GU would mean getting short at EurGbp. So this is not true, right? When i do what is suggested here i'm actually betting on the volatility of these pairs, which is by no means the same thing of shortening the Eur/Gbp. Am i right? thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #401 ---
yep - that is correct - as far as i see it.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
All very interesting... but .... YES YOU CAN LOSE in this method. Don't kid yourself and think it will ALWAYS return to cross, or to zero. Currency correlations can and will reset from time to time. The only way we "can't lose" is if: 1. We have unlimited resources and can withstand a trade that goes many hundreds of pips against us and 2) if, while in this huge drawdown, you can wait for maybe years for it to "come back", tieing up your trading margin. and 3) live with the fact that #2 may not happen!! This is why I "preach" a MaxLoss. We simply have to have it in place. Sure, we probably won't hit it, if it is set correctly, and 99% of our trades "should" eventually close in a profit if we wait, and handle the tempory DD as mentioned, but we still have to have a MaxLoss. We are getting there. The statement above that the Delta (difference in prices between the two currencies) is not that important is correct. But it does affect both our trade profit and drawdown. You could make 10p with a 70p DD, or make 70p with a 10p DD all depending on your entry. At the end of both trades, both were wins, and you will pick up more 10p wins with a smaller Delta entry. So, it is all according to your "style" and risk tolerance. All good. I will be performing a few weeks of backchecks on different time frames this weekend using the Synchbar indicator for entry/exit and NeutralHedgeOsc for direction... keep you posted... Great weekend to all!

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Please use for backtests only the version 4.X...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
It is very interesting way to trade forex, no trend lines, no pivots, no Fibs etc. It could look as some kind of arbitrage like on stocks and futures market or some kind of option strategies in short term. I also think of some kind of stop loss, e.g 150 pips drowdown, if hit then close positions no matter what.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
YES!!! (see post above, and many others before)... .We just HAVE to have a MaxLoss... agreed.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
for the last 3 days, GU/EU pairs, 15m, using SynchBar for entry, exit at Zeroline, NHOv3.4 colors for direction: 3 trades, +68, +42, +52, Drawdowns were -47, 0, and -16. Not bad. Could have ran the trades past Zeroline for aggressive exits at more profit... for the past 2 weeks on H1: three trades: +145, +65, +45... no DD data yet... Great weekend to all! I think we made some good progress this week....

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Apart from neutral strategy between: GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY GBP/USD and EUR/USD Can we use this neutral hedge strategy for any other pairs?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Please check this indicator: - On using log(DiffPrices) and not the native DiffPrices, you can better compare various pairs. - On using the mean and the standard deviation of differences, maybe is easier to find the entry/exit points. - The NH oscillators 3.x or 4.x, confirme the trade direction! Trade examples between StdDev Lines and mean line: (I taked the lots ratio = 1.20) 1. 2008.07.24 09:00 / 13:00 ===================== Sell GU 1.9944 / 1.9858 = 86 Buy EU 1.5683 / 1.5676 = -7 * 1.2 = -8 WL = +86 - 8 = +78 2. 2008.07.25 09:30 / 15:30 ===================== Buy GU 1.9870 / 1.9918 = +48 Sell EU 1.5714 / 1.5685 = +29 * 1.2 = +35 WL = +48 + 35 = +83 .

--- 帖子 #409 ---
If the differences don't go to the mean line and reverse to the StdDev line, you must close the position, with a win...! 2008.07.15 05:30 / 10:00 =================== Sell GU 1.9978 / 2.004 = -26 Buy EU 1.5934 / 1.5975 = +41 * 1.2 = +49 WL = -26 + 49 = +23 .

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I found this image on some forum. Chart plotting spread between XOM and CVX in realtime. Bollinger Bands is used for entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
As I understand, the STD line is the center one, and the mean lines the extremities, or viceversa?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Viceversa! We have only one mean line and two StdDev lines (mean plus/minus sigma*factor)

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Aha, ok

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Isn't that the same thing as a Bollinger Band?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yes, is a similar idea.

Hi guys, I understand the concept and way to trade this system, but what is the latest, as there are loads of indicators - some in use, some not. Regards, Vip

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thanks Andrew for your note ! I have programmed the normalized divergence (with Bollinger Band 20, 2), and the RSI for this oscillator. You can try this tools. I think that the trading informations are very good. For oscillator values above 2-3 StdDev, crossing the BB, and RSI under 30 or 50, the long signals are very clear (maybe clearer as from the nacked price differences). .

SwingMan, Sehr Gut!! I have a question. When the bar hits the bottom Bollinger Band, the RSI is always below 50. Did you mean it must be below 30?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi, I am struggling with this system at the moment, I understand how we are suppose to trade this system with price deivation from a pair that is not 'synched'. Can someone please outline the indicators to use and how to use them? Thanks, Vip

--- 帖子 #422 ---
SwingMan is the only one with full knowledge of the indicators. The system has never been finalized. It's still being developed.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
1. you are wrong 2. you are right 1. I think the only one who applied the indicators is Andrew. I have bought the Ehrman book earlier, and today because I had nothing to do , I programmed the oscillator and the RSI for the oscillator. I have only briefly tested visualy from M1 until H1. It seems that for some trades one must entry 2 or 3 trades in the same direction (like SpielersHedge). 2. This is a completely new concept, and maybe we can find reasonable rules for trading.

I took a trade last night and liquidated it this morning based on SwingMan's NeutralHedge oLogPriceDiff.ex4 and closed it too early but made $464 (demo). Looks very promising. If you look at my chart I drew vertical red lines where I entered and closed. The SynchBar didn't really help me, unless I'm using it wrong. How does this look to you guys, SwingMan and mrkam? --Mike

Spikey, next time you make 500$ live ! Only a point about your chart: the indicator NH v4.4 repaints, and you can see red and blue histogram lines in the same level. For time to time refresh the indicator, and you become a correct image.

Many thanks to SwingMan for laser sharp entry/exit in NeutralPrice Oscillartor_v1 which is my top choice for trading the correlation pair of EURUSD/USDCHF working in all time frames from M5 to H4. Even better and very appreciated is to have two alarms with turning on/off options one for entry and one for exit in two different or distinctive sounds. Cheers

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi Swingman, What are the parameters MaxBars = Max bars to calculate? Open close differences = not too sure? Can we have a time to start calculating attached to this, indy rather than date and time? Thanks, Vip MaxBars

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I think so , we must only be careful not to cut finger! For alarms please remmber me in the next days, but I don't know which are for you the entry/exit points. I must SEE trades from you or other members.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I must change a little the indicator in the next days. MaxBars is the period of calculation, but is better to take a start time.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Yes I am lookling at the day deviation from 00:00 and see how volatile a pair can be on any time frame.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Today I've made for this positions 109 pips, but drawdown was over 150 pips. It was because I was enter with threshold about 12 pips when HedgeRange was about 30 pips. Next time I need to wait for larger threshold.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I think so. But, you must try to use the other indicators, maybe help you (logDiff and the last two "laser" indicators NeutralPrice and RSI).

--- 帖子 #433 ---
SwingMan: What indicators (and versions of them) do you recommend be on our charts? Can you post a template with a setup that you recommend? We do need to come up with some thresholds to trigger trades and set alarms (with email alerts). Thanks again SwingMan! -

--- 帖子 #434 ---
In my post #417 is the chart with the NeutralPrice indicators. You must try if they are OK for your trading or not (I'm only programmer and haven't time to trade...). For alerts can you or other members tell me when you need alerts (cross of the Bands? cross of the zero line?, RSI below 30 or above 70?). They are many possibilitys.

Hello, anyone try chart overlay build in DealBook? This function was all the time in GFT's platform but I never use it. I'll test it.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Actually, I'm using with success chart overlay in FXCM , it's default, like in Dealbook 360. This one I'm using it's pretty accurate, I don't know about Dealbook, you have to try....If the hedge positions are reaching profit, then I think it must be ok! Ex. yesterday I have maked over 1,000 USD in a 5,000 USD acct, only with EU/GU....

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Way to go dragosd! Would you be so kind as to put up your charts for the period and explain your entry/exit points? Many thanks &amp; keep up the good work! David

--- 帖子 #439 ---
can not agree more.. btw, i use daily percentage change rather than open demo account..If the difference is too much between EUR/USD and GBP/USD, ill enter the market...so far its doing good..

--- 帖子 #440 ---
What percent change do you use for entering ? How do you tell buy or sell the pair ? are you using some type of percent indicator ?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
it is just ordinary daily change in percentage..u can see in website below or other website.. http://www.cnbc.com/id/15839178 For example: EUR/USD = -0.15% GBP/USD = -0.45% u can tell that GBP/USD is far weaker than EUR/USD...so you buy GBP/USD and sell EUR/USD...

--- 帖子 #442 ---
what difference in % is good for you to trade? 0.3% and larger? Do you add some positions when that difference is getting wider? And when you close your positions, when diff is e.g. 0,0% between two pairs? Sorry for a lot of qestions but this way of trading is also interesting .

--- 帖子 #443 ---
i just use this method for 3 days..so i really can not suggest any certain number...so far, i use : GBP/USD - EUR/USD &gt;=0.2% or GBP/USD - EUR/USD&lt;=-0.2%... i use +/- 0.2% because i want to enter the market everyday...much larger will be much safer but you have to wait longer... Anyway, this is still premature idea and need a lot of improvement &amp; research..i will have a lot to tell after 2 months..

--- 帖子 #444 ---
nope i dont add extra position.. yap..i close when the diff is 0,0% or i got 15 pips.....it is enough considering i enter the market everyday..

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thank you for your response my stupid question is why are you buying a weaker currancy and selling a stronger one. sorry for the question but i am new at this Thank you

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Andrie, I am not sure how you are getting your percentage....Could you give us an example of each? Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #447 ---
This thread is all about buying weaker and selling stronger . That's the general idea that somewhere in the future between correlated pairs again will be balance, and there is our gain. Like Zeusjones said we're buying underperformer and selling overperformer. Question is, how most accurate measure it.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
it is already stated in Zeusjoes first post in this thread. The idea is both pairs will move in the same direction as they are correlated. So in example above, it is either GBP/USD will go higher to chase EUR/USD or EUR/USD will fall following GBP/USD...

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I am sorry.I dont understand your question. English is not my first language and i always have a bad mark in english class.. ehm..let see if i am not mistaken your question: GBP/USD = -0.45% EUR/USD = -0.15% So following the formula, GBP/USD - EUR/USD = (-0.45%)-(-0.15%) = -0.3% ..because -0.3% &lt; than -0.2% , you enter the market... is that your question about??

--- 帖子 #450 ---
exactly...i guess we should backtested it....but i dont have any idea how to do it..

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I've never understood using G/U-E/U rather than E/J-G/J. The correlation for EUR/JPY-GBP/JPY is 94% and is 74% for GBP/USD-EUR/USD. A deviation between the JPY pairs is a lot more meaningful and certain to correct than between the USD pairs.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Andrie, Right on! That answers my question. Thanks Bruce

--- 帖子 #453 ---
you are right...actually i am trading both...

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I do think there would be better oportunities in EJ/GJ too, but i found the indicators we are using are MUCH more reliable applied to EU/GU. Don´t know why it works better on them but the "delta" or "hedge range" is almost exactly the amount of pips won, when it gets back to zero. On EJ/GJ I had a trade -50 pips while indicator showed "range" decreased by 30 pips or so. So i feel much safer trading EU/GU but would love to use EJ/GJ too.

Hi friends, I'm not sure if mrkam is banned, or just suspended temporarily. I hope not banned. I think he was cited for violation of "Rule #3: No Forum Promotion" The rule states: "Promotional agendas tend to compromise the integrity of forum discussions and are therefore not permitted.* If you make money by servicing Forex traders in any way, shape, or form, you are NOT permitted to post in the forums unless you have prior approval. If you attempt to use the forums as a promotional tool you will be banned without warning! I don't see what mrkam did as promoting a product, but that's just my opinion. Hopefully the mods will reconsider. Good luck, mrkam.

SwingMan, You are the best as usually. Thanks for normalized div indicator. You ask me how I trade it. As I wrote I used it some times ago (now I trade mainly directionaly not pairs). So I use this normalized div above / below 2.5 (sometimes 3, sometimes 2) as warning that reversal in pair is comming. Next I look at price to see some sign of reversal, it could be double top/bottom, some candlestick patterns like doji, hammer, engulfing bar etc. I use also moving avg simple 200 (lime), 75(red) , 21 (yellow) and 8 ema (white). Usually wait at least as price close above/below 8 ema and see if is not to closely to another MA especialy 200. If there is a trend normalized div could give signal to early - one should confirm it with price or another sign of reversal. In picture below is an example. Red vertical line is at position normalized div is bellow 2.5 but there is a trend and we should wait until yelow vertical line (double bottom and close abowe 8 ema) or white line (close above 21 sma). Once again thank You SwingMan for many very good EA and indicators You posted on this and another forums. Regards, Andrew

Andrew - many, many thanks for your response. If you have time, please give us more comments on current charts and our indicators!

How do you know which one of the pair is going to revert to the others level of gain/loss?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I actually just took my last trade based on visually seeing the dip on SwingMan's LogPriceDifference indicator. On the chart I saw that the indicator went significantly below the "short" line (I caught it a little late) so I entered with a Buy of GBPUSD. Then I basically just waited for an acceptable profit, which was $688 USD. I'm now trying the #PH#HedgeAndTP#09 EA to close my positions automatically with a predetermined profit. I am now also watching the NeutralPrice Oscillator_v1 to see how that helps. -

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hi, to only excuse for my bad English. What think you fend off an indicator which consists of two Lagueren (one for each pair) Perhaps a good entrance help? SwingMan what do you think about it?

Swingman, Can you please supply us with an indicator, which I think you half have, chart overlay with a start date/time? i would like to use the previous days or start of day to see how price deviates from a correlated pair. thanks, vip

Hi SwingMan, I've tested run NeutralPrice Oscillartor_v1 with good accuracy of entry/exit following your post #417 screenshot- three vertical orange lines where each orange line can serve both of entry or exit depending on get in the trade or get out the trade. Therefore, if you don't mind, the alarm can be set at the bar below the top upper band (previous bar still punch above upper band) or the bar above the lowest band (previous bar still punch below lowest band) with turning on/off option and prefer to have two different chimes where one for upper and other for lower so one can tell from the sound where the signal is from the upper or lower. The alarm applies on one bar only and no need to continue for next bars. A pop up is welcome to state the time of trigger. There is no need to have any alarm at the zero line. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I also have been testing the NeutralPrice Oscillartor_v1 and I'd like to see a little more flexibility with the alarms. My birthday wish is for a user input parameter for a "short" alarm, and another one for the "long" alarm; with the inputs to be for a std deviation threshold. For example, my preference is to enter a "buy GU / sell EU" when the bar breaks down through a -2.5, so I'd like to be able to enter -2.5 for the "long" alarm. Conversely, I'd like to enter +2.7 or so for the "short" alarm so when the bar breaks up through the 2.7 threshold I would know to "sell GU / buy EU". This way, over time, I can adjust these settings without SwingMan having to be bothered with it. Thanks, SwingMan!!!!

ok, the alarms come in the next version.

Hi, I continue my experiments for cumulative series of every M5 candle range. I try do download data from MT4 servers but there was a lot of missing candles (don't know why, even dl from history center), so I dl it from GFT text file, convert it to .xls file. I've got only closing prices differences (close - previous close) eliminating gaps on opening candle. This type of chart won't repaint, and we've got all closing prices and times! So backtest is a piece of cake. I bectested it, and what is very good, that spread betweetn pairs is +--10 pips our gain when it come back to "0" or about zero. Here is the screen of cumulative series with spread from 25.07.2008 20:00 to 07:20 31.07.2008 GMT time for EU and GU.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
WaHooooooooo.... !

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Everybody, I'm so imporessed that this cumulative series works! Especially that the spread value between two pairs (delta) is very near to our gain. Here is the spreadsheet (GMT+1), please look at it, maybe it is possible to make something like this in MT4.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Check this out, example from last minutes:

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hello MagicTrader Can you explain your spreadsheet a little bit? How are you coming up with Columns C, D, E, and H? By the way can setup Excel to read MT4 close data in realtime if this helps. Trade Well... Brent

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I have started looking at this thing about 3 months ago, didnt realise there was so many indicators and other methods surrounding this. Can somone point me to a post that will explain indicators on this thread?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
When I've dl data in txt file, I convert it to xls file, and it convert like in one cell was 1,5 and in other e.g 595 so I simply add 15000 to the rest. The same with GU. But it doesn't change anything, we just don't have "," .

--- 帖子 #476 ---
There really is not such a single post. I had to read the whole thread to get caught up. Search for all posts to this thread by SwingMan for his indicators. He is also contributing greatly to the Speiler Hedge thread and has produced a great combo of indicators based on the Ehrman book on how to trade pairs. mrkam is working on the SynchBar indicator and EA, so you can search for his name for posts within the last three weeks or so to cover it. His conversations with billbss will provide pretty good insight to where their strategy has evolved, and we're all looking forward to his next version. Then of course, magictrader is working on his strategy and has posted some great stuff. I'm not sure how we're going to marry all of these strategies together into a nice package, but the end result looks promising. -

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Dear Magictrader, What is your method? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Got it...then it's no problem to do this in realtime with Excel. Please see attached Excel file. It will pull data for GBPUSD and EURUSD in realtime from MT4. So you need to have MT4 open. You'll also need to "Enable DDE Server" in MT4 by going to Tools -&gt; Options, select Server Tab and check box "Enable DDE Server". Trade Well..... Brent

--- 帖子 #479 ---
WOW! this is GREAT and so simple Can't wait for the next week to test it. Theory is, that the spread value is almost or the same value as our gain. So what we need to do is to wait for good delta for us (e.g. 30 pips) then we know when spread is 0 then we've got 30 pips (- transaction spread). We' re reliable on that pairs will come back and spread will be "0" at some time. If sread is getting wider then easily we can add some positions. Thanks again forex2stay! Lenoxer, I'm trading with SwingMan indicators with great results (hundred of pips in a week) so it's very good method, but in the same time I was trying to develop something else. Now I can test it too and compare this two methods.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Great job magictrader. I look foward to setting this up in Excel using IBFX data feed. I hope for success undergoing this task.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Just a word of caution....please do some research and import some data into Excel using MagicTraders Excel spreadsheet and backtest. I've done 4hrs and 1hr for 2006 and 2007 (with my own formula) and I've seen spreads get to 1000+ pips. It's just like anything else you need to get a game plan together cause this has the potential to wipe you out if a persons not careful. Trade Well.... Brent

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Yes.... very interesting math to address the same issue.... One question: In your spreadsheet, you set 7/25/08 at 20:00 as the "ZeroPoint", that is, where each currency is the same, as your basis. Then you track the up and down from there, etc... How do you pick that point in time to set zero? Is it arbitrary, or do you have a method for determining When to "reset" it to zero...

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I have the same concerns. It's tough to know where quilibrium is. That is what I like about SwingMan's NeutralPriceOsc_v1 indicator; it is dynamically recalculating equilibrium and showing the standard deviation from it. Magictrader's approach is less scientific, but fundamentally can work, but IMHO is difficult to determine where the trade triggers should be. Set for too low or too high a spread and you may not get very many trades. With some trial and error you can probably come up with some decent triggers, but they may need to change with time and fundamental changes. -

--- 帖子 #484 ---
It was just first history data from broker, but I think to place "0" maybe at market opening in sunday and reset it every week. There are two possibilities with different indicators: 1. Repaints and more probability that pairs will cross in future, also time frames to choose. 2. Set the start data, then no repaints, and I don't know with what probability pairs will come back, but I think that setting starting date e.g at the begining of the month, and reset it every months it is like larger TF from previous indicators, and setting e.g. one week starting date is like short TF. Maybe something is in it. So spreads for TF reset every week should be smaller.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Yes the starting point is the key. It all reality your starting point could be when the spread is already 200 pips apart. Not sure what you mean by SwingMan's indicator dynamically reclculating equilibrium. He has the same delima. He has to pick a starting point from something. Personally I go with the peaks/valleys. So on my charts i go back to where the two currency's last peaked or had a V-shape at the same 4hr candle and I use that close of that candle as my starting point. Trade Well.... Brent

--- 帖子 #486 ---
SwingMan's indicator, as I understand it, does "mean" calculations from the current bar going backwards, so in simple terms it is calculating the most recent avg price difference with every new bar. Apparently he is using a logarithmic method to weight the avg in some manner. He posted an excerpt from Ehrman's book on "Normalizing Pairs Divergence", which is a bit over my head at the moment.... but I like the results I'm seeing. -

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Serios repaint here I notice that the only diferent thing is the first/last bar date. Whats the problem?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
For your review and comment, I am attaching the .ex4 of the current SynchBar Indicator. Thanks all who have shared in the programming expense of this, all costs are covered, and those who "helped" received the mq4 file,... (and THANKS for the help on that....) That will be that. Also shown is an example screen shot. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!! SynchBar needs the NeutralHedgeOscillatorv3.4 on the chart in order to paint it's bars accordingly. If you don't want to paint the bars according to the NHO calc, you don't need it on the chart. I have it on the example, then minimized by dragging the borders. (Ii have noticed it takes a few minutes for some reason for Synchbars to get matched up with NHO... The Indicator works like this: 1. You set a "# of Bars" parameter, which is simply then number of bars the indicator will show. I have it default to 240, but it can be anything you want. If you use NHOv3.4, your #of Bars HAS to equal Period_range in order for the colors to line up.. (240 bars at 15m is about 2.5 trading days back). 2. Each bar is simply the mathematical difference between Curr1 and Curr2, with NO equalling factor applied. JUST THE DIFFERENCE, raw data. Short bars, the prices are closer, long bars, the prices are further apart. 3. The Indicator looks at the number of bars shown, finds the High and the Low, and calculates the mid-point by (Hi+Lo)/2, and plots it as the Gold line. This is simply inteded to be a reference "ZeroLine", halfway between the period Hi/Lo you select. 4. The red lines are manually set "Entry" Lines. Again, you can make these be whatever you want. They are set at X pips from the ZeroLine. NOTE: Both 3 and 4 are dynamic, meaning they may change. This is NOT repainting. What they do is change dynamically according to the market. If you add a new bar that sets a new hi/lo, then you get a new ZeroLine calc'd, and new EntryLevels set. If you drop off a high or low at the first (oldest) bar, then you also will get a re-calc, and new Hi/Lo/Entry lines. (There is a trading logic to this, but you can noodle that out!!) This is similar to SwingMans' difference Log indicator, just a bit more basic, more "raw". The indicator itself is very basic, showing strictly price action, and the ebb and flow of the two prices as they move closer and further away from each other. It is this flow that we are endeavoring to trade. The purpose of tieing to the NHO indicator is to try to get a determination of trade direction. (and there may be better ways to do this!!) For example: (and this is just one idea of how to trade this, maybe....) 1. Find a # of bars you like. Set SynchBars and NHO to match. 2. Set the Hi/Low entry lines at what YOU want for entries. You can enter either at the high or low, for a high(er) probability movement to the Gold, centerline. 3. Red bars mean SELL Curr1, BUY Curr2, Green mean the opposite. 4. Take the trade at a touch from the inside of either entry line, Buy/Sell per #3. 5. Exit wherever you want. Possibilities would include: fixed # of net pips profit, or at the touch of the ZeroLine (gold) or, all the way to a touch of the opposite entry line. 6. Set a MaxLoss, of course.... REV: PS: you need to have BOTH charts open on the time frame you are dealing with in order for the Indicator to get it's data for BOTH currencies.... Any other ideas??

--- 帖子 #489 ---
SwingMan told us his NeutralPriceOscillator v3.4 repaints. I don't really even use that one. The only area of importance, again in my humble opinion, is the current/last bar on the NeutralPriceOscillator_v1 and whether or not it is surpassing my upper/lower thresholds. You trade in realtime and you're looking for a deviation that may last only minutes, so your trigger has to be in the last bar. -

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Agree, same experience here with NeutralPriceOscillator_v1 has precise entry again today making pips in hedging pairs. This is the one to shine the way running it for me. Very nice work by SwingMan. This forum is super.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
For now on USD/CHF and USD/JPY spread is over 100 pips with starting time of first candle in this week. So maybe repainting is good for us, because everything is changing when market developes. But with repainting sometimes there is no gain on pair cross, and we need to add some positions. With starting time, we will have our spread gain when it will come back to "0", but when it come back, and how big spread could be? Nobody knows.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Agreed, and we have all discussed this in the past as well.... past bars on the NHO don't really mean anything (in realtime trading), so it doesn't really matter if they repaint or not. The current bar is what matters. The past bars would only be valuable if they did not repaint for past "backchecking", but I for one put a lot more credence in forward testing... As far as SynchBar goes, the same thing applies, although the past bars DO help us in giving us a visual (and quantative) view of how the prices have been moving with relation to each other.... which possibly can give us a better "feel" for entries and exits. The ONLY calc SynchBar uses from NHO is the color of the bar. Color, that is it. This "might" be helpful in determining which currency is stronger compared to the other, which was the purpose of the colors. We can then determine Buy/Sell or Sell/Buy in our entry. In my testing, the colors seem to work pretty darn well! As does using the current bar for entry... it is just that determining an actual entry level via NHO is tough because the view of history is skewed... hence the idea for SynchBar to give an accurate, non-changing, view. Great approaches and ideas!!

--- 帖子 #493 ---
If I may ask, after which rules are set the red and green bar colours?

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Swingman! Sure.... per your NeutralHedgeOscillator v3.4... SynchBar "gets" the colors from your indicator! and I don't know the calc it goes through... The bars don't match up exactly, but I have found that in realtime, at the extremes of the swings (hi &amp; lo areas), the SynchBar colors match the v3.4 colors...

--- 帖子 #495 ---
OK, if you say so ... Try also the two indicators from Ehrmans book. They should also be very useful. Unfortunately, I have no time to test it, I must develop other indicators ...

--- 帖子 #496 ---
There is also one interesting thing in selecting price (time) strategy, that if we enter e.g at delta 30 pips, then if delta become e.g 90 pips, then our loss is exactly 60 pips. At the beginning we know our gain (entry delta) but we don't know our loss. We can know possible average high delta in forward testing because bectest every week could be difficult. The best thing is, that delta is exactly the ammount of pips to gain. It looks like in this kind of trading risk to reward ratio is mirroring to standard what everybody learning. But it looks that we've got very big probability to success in each trade.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Indicators, Indicators, Indicators... what is it with people and Indicators?!?! I do not even know how half of these indicators work... you guys are really complicating this system more than it needs to be. MagicTrader is using a spreadie with what he 'quotes' with the price deviation, I think that is more than enough... I did a trade with a chart overlay, I requested Swingman to do a chart overlay with a date/time parameter, but not heard anything. G/U and E/U are not a highly correlated pair, but I made money today, by the simple chart overlay and that is it... price deviation and chart overlay... nothing more. This was done on a 5 min TF - scalped around 10 pips. Regards, Vip

--- 帖子 #498 ---
guess121 Indicators are only the visualisation of spread sheets, that's all. I think the first version(s) of the overlay indicator has a date as begin of the calculation.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hello, look at this: no news, but so big movement on EUR/GBP. It's theory but maybe some big boys closing their hedge positions?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Ok, here it is in reality what we are trading if we set some start time: The thing is, that somehow delta "0" point is still moving. It's not like this if we start counting delta from 20:00 monday with value of EUR/GBP at e.g. 0,7850, then delta go to 60 pips, and "0" will not have to be at 0,7850. Question is, is it possible to calculate where "0" point could be. And now if we look at EUR/GBP we've got sideways trend, but since 2007 was strong up trend. How then this system works?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Here it is how the our zero (gain) point was moving on EUR/GBP: Maybe delta zero point will follow the trend when it will be strong, and then we need small retracement to get our gain. To check this out we should wait for some one way week trend on EUR/GBP.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I think it will be very difficult to predict where this point is and when. Correlation between pairs may be easy broken and so easy come to normal..it is just the meter of time...and it's hard to predict it. Because pairs trading it is market-neutral strategy. no matter is there trend on the market or no...You only choose time frame. System works on all time frames. Small tf. -&gt; small spread, quick trade; Higher -&gt; spread bigger and you have to wait longer...

--- 帖子 #503 ---
But it's only possible if we look at some bars in past (e.g. 200 candles) then value of spread will be always changing. Like on the screen, in the morning it was about 70 pips, now less then 10 pips. I was starting build position when it was 40 pips and I'm still losing. It is because of strong down trend on CHF/JPY and the zero point is somewhere on that chart. It doesn't matter if we pull the trigger using indicators which will move with the market, or using delta with selected start time, because our gain is somewhere on cross pair chart. Later I'll make spreadsheet for USDCHF/USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
CHF/JPY is calculated from movements of USDCHF and USDJPY. And if on the CHF/JPY down trend its mean that USDCHF is in up trend and USDJPY is consolidating or vise versa (USDCHF is consolidating and USDJPY is in down trend), or so. And it's risky to open neutral position (counter trend) when short time trend is in place on one pair. You need wait for consolidation (correction) to open position.

Let's see what will happen in the future (maybe NFP will help) because on M15 and M30 there is still big HedgeRange and it should go to zero.

Since the beginning of the week USD/CHF is big overperformer to USD/JPY with almost no cross. Maybe EUR/USD and GBP/USD will be more safe pairs?

how much the biggest size of delta that you got so far?how much the average delta?

--- 帖子 #508 ---
..... and just for a parting shot before the weekend.... New SynchBar indicator, same indicator, just modified to show as a line. This one does not interface with the NHOv3.4 like the bar version does, so you do not need NHO on your chart. The "bars" are set to black, so to make them disappear, set them to the same color as your background, and you will just get the Synch line, the ZeroLine, and the two manually set Hi/Lo Entry lines. The trade shown was from earlier today. Sell GU / Buy EU was determined per NHOv3.4. Use the "Entryline" exit, where you enter at one, exit at the other. (more aggressive). Great weekend to all!!

swingman thanks, my bad - I found it. thanks, vip

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi Swingman, good job on those indicators. Question for you on NeutralPrice Oscillator v1, I see the Price_differences of GBP/USD and EUR/USD set to 34 by default, is it always 34 or how is that calculated? Very good indicator BTW. Thanks

--- 帖子 #511 ---
The Period_Differences=34 is for the calculation of Mean and StdDeviation, and is only a Fibonacci number.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hello, bad weather today so I try something with setting start time for counting delta. I set start time on the top of EUR/GBP last monday. There were no possibility to get gain and delta chart looks almost exactly like EUR/GBP chart delta is getting wider.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi Swingman/All, If anyone can answer this, does Chart Overlay Point-Time indicator repaint? Thanks, Vip

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Yes, Overlay Point repainting. This is weird, but when I was looking on similarity between shape of delta EU GU and EUR/GBP I put delta chart on EUR/GBP chart (since 18.07.2008 M15). Correlation between them is over 96%. Maybe thanks to that we can set better entry points. Also I think that there are now two reasons why we can get some gain. 1. Correlations between pairs, 2. Correlations between delta and cross pair. What do you think about it?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I am using the one with date and time. And specifying date and time, therefore I am guessing that this should not repaint - or I am incorrect in my assumption. I think high correlated pairs... I am not really looking at delta, as this is very difficult to provide, unless we have some maths guru that can help out. Though I am more looking for your first point... we want price to deviate some what and then trade per the 'threshold'. I am more looking at change like spielers system on a daily basis and entering trades daily and then closing out the trades daily as well, if I can. I personally think this is what we should concenrate on, what do you? We look at price deviation in the day, forex opens and closes 5PM EST time - that's when roll is paid. If we have to hold positions, then we look at position averaging.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Everything is easy when cross pairs are in sideways trend. What if there will be 0,5% day change, then 0,4% day change, and so on? If cross pair is trending then standard looking for deviation could be not enough. Like now on CHF/JPY. I entered on HedgeRange 40 pips and I'm still loosing. (demo account).

Magic Trader, I have attached this spreadsheet, this imports the data from the MT4. All - I have got this from Brians Rollover Method - in Forex Disscussion. I am not the aurther of this excel spreadsheet or export data script. I have amended this for my purposes, it is totally different. If you want me to remove it, I will - but here it is. The Dsn-02_QuoteToExcel_MultiPair-GEN.ex4 file needs to go in your script folder. This is a work in progress if anyone wants to improve and make this better and get it working properly - as it sort of works - but I cannt extract whole day data at the moment, not have a chance to look at it. thanks, vip

Hi everybody, hi this thread, where disappeared the very simple and profitable method by ZeusJoes? Thank you ZeusJoes! No problem, simply gains and gains again ! Trade well! Josef.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I think this the same system... It is a matter of finding a good way of spread widening and take respective long and short calls. regards, vip

--- 帖子 #522 ---
hi, can someone just check that i understand this system correctly. basically, we look at two pairs that are positively correlated. like for example, eurjpy and gbpjpy. If the spread between the prices of two increases considerably then we sell the one thats doing good and long the other one. can someone tell me which indicator on this thread works the best in finding the spread and allows you to look at historical spreads ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Well, that is exactly the question we all have been working from post #1 !! You are welcome to contribute and help as well. The original ZeusJoe "indicator" was a demo account. Yep. He bought one, sold the other, and watched his net profit in the demo platform. Nothing fancy. If you look at the math, all that is showing us is pip by pip the net movement of the two strategies, from a given "ZeroPoint", or time. So Josef, nothing happend to the original method... it is what we are talking about and pursuing!! We are just addressing the math and methodology, that's all. But that brought many questions. When do you take your demo positions? When do you enter? When do you exit...?? Is there an indicator that we can put on our trading platform to "see" this movement??... and that has given rise to a lot of contribution by SwingMan, Magic Trader, Guess and others... (heck, I even tossed in perhaps the simplest indicator of all, pure price difference between the currencies!!) So we are getting there. It takes time to develop a system, especially when such "radically" new indicators are required... ultimately, it is hoped a workable EA can result, but the first step is to develop a quantitative way to represent the "two positions of ZuesJoe", define repeatable entry/exit rules for all market types, and code the effort. Please stick around and help us!!

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi, isn't the net profit he looks at directly proportional to the difference of the two prices? If yes, why can't we just use your indicator that shows the difference and just see how it moved with price recently so we know when to open positions. Can u tell me what post has this indicator pls?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hello Eagle_eye, everything will be easy if we will always picks tops and bottoms. In this strategie is the same. There is no guarantee that we will have some profit looking only which pair is overperformer and which is underperformer because it doesn't have to change. There could be all days that one pair will be overperform and second underperform and if your entry was too early (which you don't know at the beginning) then you will loosing. Now we know that our gains depends of cross pairs movements in maybe 90%. So point is, how do know which pair overperforming is ended and which underperforming is ended. In summary we are trying to predict where will cross pair go looking at connetions between two pairs.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Anyone know why my overlay is looking out of sync? I am using the very first indicator that came out on this thread, with time and date. Thanks, Vip

--- 帖子 #527 ---
that's right. Theres no way to know for sure, you just use the indicator and look at previous times.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi fellow traders, I have made a new indicator which shows the price difference between 2 pairs on a daily basis. The daily cycle is divided into 2 colors. Every day at the starting hour the indicator starts with a price difference of zero. In this way you can see the divergence on a daily basis. Have a try.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Nice. I'll check out if we can add BBs to the Indicator to get a sense of StdDev.

Set the date further in time, like end of July, but it also, as it seems, depends on TF.

Hello, fewhills Thank you for your indicator. I have a question, how can we change the green ad that appears as they are with you, lower right corner.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
fewhills, I like your indicator. As I write, E/J is nearly +3 standard deviations above median line on hrly chart with 5 day look back on Linear Regression Channel. G/Y is between -1 standard deviation and the median line on same time frame with same look back period. Linear Regression Channell will clearly identify the overperformer/underperformer of the pairs. The E/J upward spike is the cause of current de-correlation. To arbitrate these pairs E/J should be sold and G/J should be bought, but only if current de-correlation is statistically significant. Can you program current LRC values of the pairs into your indicator? This will identify which of the pairs is to be bought, and which is to be sold. In short, what to trade. As to statistical significance of de-correlation...can you program LRC over your Price Divergence bars? With this addition we will better be able to determine statistically significant de-correlations. In short, when to trade. Pippo

Indicator Request: Could some clever guy maybe develop this indicator? With some extras? http://img233.imageshack.us/my.php?image=chartly1.jpg I've found it on my VTTrader. It's called Rate of Change (ROC) The Formular is simply you can get the Output in Pips or in Percentage. Here's a screenshot with both plotted on EUR/USD and USD/CHF. You can easily spot that there is a 2 Pip Divergence between those two. Now comes the tricky part. USD/CHF could move 10 pips up leaving EUR/USD behind. You'd notice it if you compare these two indicators but since only Close Data is recorded to the graph alot of information is lost. Wouldn't it be interresting to have a candlestick chart as an indicator of the actual spread within the timeperiod? Timeframe begins -&gt; Price discorralates marking a High on our Candlestick Price Spread Indicator. And so on.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Does anyone know if this a repainting indie? If so, can anyone please put a time and date on this indie for when we want it to start? Thanks, Vip

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi, I'm interested with quantitative methods and I'm working currently with sthg like Neutral Hedge. Let's have a look on my Model ECM, Error Correction Model. As I woud like, it will help me to forecast the moves of the spread between GBPusd and EURusd. It's just a first one, beginning, but you can see for example a blue position on it, which is titled "Model Zalezności dlugookresowej", it is the Longterm Dependence and looks very pretty with GBPusd and EURusd. At the bottom of the chart, there's ECM, which role is to tell you what moves will be seen on the GBPusd if the EURusd is now at some level. So we will now then, how would the spread be like. What you think?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
You can use the previuos version, Overlay chart point/time. What I did, I set the starting date of this indi at a date where synch bars line was at 0 point. For the last two days, the results are super ok with GBPUSD/EURUSD. I wonder if this method will keep on track like this, I mean if is giving real signals...

--- 帖子 #545 ---
NowAndLater- I wanted to ask you if the excellent indicator you posted on the spieler thread would also work if applied to a EUR/GBP chart? Would it be showing divergance between EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY as it moved through the various levels? Sorry if this is a stupid question as the indicator is probably set up especially to track only EUR/CHF but having seen it on a EUR/GBP chart it seems to be quite useful.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I hope this is not another thread that dies! Any updates anyone? Regrads, Vip

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Think it's not dying thread cause there is still a lot of things to improve. First of all this is great system for consolidation periods on cross pairs. Now I'm trying to find out what are the best moments for entry if we've got strong trend on cross pair. Because if we enter to early we will be loosing. My first idea is to look on correlation between EU and GU for "n" periods back (now 200 M5 periods back). The logic behind this concept: if we've got strong trend on EG then correletion will be going to 0 or to -values. Then no trade. We can trade only when correletion is about 90-100% (EU and GU are in balance in "n" periods time). When we've got this correletion then trade in direction showing by decorreletion period. When correletion is 90-100% then it means the EG is in sideways trend, but it can still go in the same direction, but if there is one strong movement in one direction then probability of retracement is increasing and also increasing our chance to get some gain.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
You also need to take into account the fact that one lot EURUSD does not equal one lot GBPUSD, because if you trade them one lot on each side. one is going to make more money and also potentially lose more money

--- 帖子 #549 ---
In this strategy as I understand it you are not necessarily looking to be absolutely market neutral and you dont need the perfect hedge in terms of lots. The reason being that when decorrelation occurs it is because one pair has either risen or fallen way more than the other pair in such a way that it is out of synch thus causing this decorrelation. By placing your trade after this decorrelation has happened you are supposed to benefit from the resulting correction of that particular pair that leads to the inevitable correlation at some point.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
And this is why we can make money. If we always adjust lot size to valatility then we will always have zero sum. Thing is how to know wich pair will be have more volatility then other one. Now I try to look at EUR/USD and reverse USD/CHF (CHF/USD) it looks more correlated pairs so drowdowns should be smaller (gains also but more confident). And also EUR/CHF looks like to move more sinusoidally then EUR/GBP. Sinusoidally movement of cross pair is the key to this strategy.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
This is exactly what happened to me on Sunday night / Monday. The strong move in EURGBP produced a substantial loss in my demo account; about -121 pips. I think what we need is a hedge against EG trends. If it was convenient (which it is not) it would be nice to be able to buy out-of-the-money call/put options on EG and strangle it about 60 pips above and below its recent avg spread. That would allow us to make money on the GU-EU correlation trade as EG oscillates sideways. Then if EG broke out of the range one of our options would protect us. Can anyone else think of a way to hedge EURGBP while we play the GU-EU spread oscillation? -

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Dear Spikey, How expensive is it to strangle a position? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I don't know what exchanges are trading Forex options, so I haven't been able to see any prices. The CME (which trades currency futures their options) has a Euro FX future and options (not a currency "pair", though). As the Sept Future is trading at 1.5388 the Sept 1.5450 call is at 19 pips which is $237.50, and the 1.5300 is a whopping 108 pips (which is overpriced today because of the drop in the future's price) which equates to $1,350. So this totals $1,587.50. But again, this is not really equivalent to EURGBP options. But if it were, you could set the strangle and trade the GU-EU hedge for the next 4 weeks, assuming it stays in the range, and make $400 to $600 several times a week, then close the options for whatever they're worth then. If the price moved close to or passed one of your option positions the price of it would go significantly up to cover most, if not all of the costs. Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi Pipstar thanks for the reply. Yes i understand what you are saying but lets say that eurusd is the pair thats out of synch if you trade still trade one lot of each pair the movement or potential profit is going to be alot less because you should be trading something like 1.26 lots eurusd to 1 lot gbpusd. In that case would it not be better to concentrate on gbpusd and only trade when that is the one thats out of synch. Do i make sense or have i totally lost the plot

--- 帖子 #555 ---
When GU and EU are out of sync, there is no "one" that is out of sync. They both are. You don't know how they will move to get back in sync. If you choose one of them, it may not move, at all and the other make the correct move to reestablish the synchronization.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
billbss, Most of the time one of the pairs will be primarilly responsible for the out of sync state. High impact good/bad news concerning specifically GBP, for example, causing large scale strengthening or weakening in that currency, a spike, would be causal. The process of returning to the sync state would most likely be a result, to a large degree, of GBP returning (retracing) toward the price level where it was before the high impact news event, rather than EUR catching up. Pippo

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Dear Spikey, The idea of buying an OTM strangle is attractive from a MM point of view. You would then feel comfortable trading with higher leverage. The question is, can you pay for it with 1-2 weeks of trading and then be able trade the "free" hedge for a couple of weeks after that for profits. How and where can one price and buy either a EURGBP or EURCHF strangle? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #558 ---
That's the problem. It's not currently convenient to buy Forex Options. Oanda has some info on Forex Options on their website, but it's not real apparent on where to go to trade them (other than to a bank).

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi Mike.... been noodling this (your question about how to handle the extended out of synch runs....) a bit. Here are some ideas that I am pursuing.... 1) Have a maxloss, and take the lumps as they come. Assumes the loss runs are few and far between, far outweighed by the "usual" swings... (this has been my approach....) 2) defiined risk (loss) options... but hard to do, if not impossible... 3) don't get in in the first place... by this I mean tailor our entry a bit better... I have been looking at a two stage system... first, our price differenctial (delta) gives us the GO when we are far apart, however we define that. Up to now, we would enter at that point. Rather, don't enter yet, look to something to indicate a REVERSAL, and only enter when the price differential and/or other indicators show us thing are returning... If they keep going and going, we don't enter. One idea I am looking at is the RSI-15 of EURGBP on one time frame GREATER. If we are at 15m for our GU/EU combo, then we look at 30m EG for confirmation. Something like this: For a Long GU, Short EU entry, we want the price differential at or beyond our threshold, then we want the EG-30m RSI to be &gt; 70, but don't enter UNTIL it breaks the 70 line AGAIN, from ABOVE. (opposite at the 30 line for the converse trade...) Just sort of thinking out loud .....

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Of your choices, #1 is the easiest to implement while #3 is probably the most wise. My problem with #3 is it requires more screen time, unless SwingMan or others can code an indicator that sends me an email when the EG-30m RSI is crossing the 30 or 70 line heading toward the middle (this would be great). So right now I lean toward #1. Do you have any recommendations for a reasonable TP &amp; SL combination using 1 lot GU &amp; 1.2 lots EU position size?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
This is a great topic, one of the best so far on FF. However, I have read so many topics like this on other forums and at the end of the day, it all comes down to speculation, risk, and reward. Is a trading system like this really that much better then a very simple moving average system? I am still undecided.....

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Better?? you should know "better" than to ask that!!! Better in what way? Better to who? Profit? Just making the "most pips" is not "better"... what is your trading psyche? Do you like "always in" systems... if so, you just made 400 pips with the $... but you have lost 100p here 100p there for months... Do you like scalping... 10p here, 8p there... no 400p gains... but you always crank in the pips day in day out regardless of the market... How about risk adversness... are you good with losing 200p? How about 40p to gain 10, but happens once out of 20? Better? Maybe not the question.. Different! now we are talking... Everything is speculative in forex. What we are endeavoring to do here is fresh. Who knows if it is "better", but regardless, it sure is fun!! Stick around see what happens. Help us with your insight... It's a good life!

--- 帖子 #564 ---
The best way I can answer this is: Look at friday's action when EUR/USD fell much further than GBP/USD. But when GBP rallied a little EUR rallied even less. In some instances GBP rose while EUR stayed still. So it appears to me that EUR was the one out of synch. Therefore, it made sense to buy GBP/USD and sell EUR/USD. Regarding the lot size I prefer 1 to 1 but if you like 1 to 1.26 I suppose you can try it. Like I said before, I am not looking for the perfect hedge. With a higher ratio, you may well make more profits but since this system in not foolproof, it will also increase your losses. Also you must time your entry very well or else you will be carrying a hedge that never correlates you into profit.

Hi guys. I'm a big fan of this kind of operation. In the stock markets we know it as Long/Short position. Here in Brazil we do for example long on the EMBR3 (Embraer- a flight company) and short on PETR4 (Petrobas - oil and energy), and we got a lot of bucks. So im trying this on forex... My doubts: 1) Which pairs and why to operate then? What's the main link between the pairs Ihave to observe? 2) For the GbyJpy and EurJpy what is a good spread to open a position? I got some profit from spread araound .4110. 3) Whats the behavior of the spread? Does it usually stay in range or can go to "infinity"? 4) does someone have the historical data of the spread? Well, i made some program on visual basic. It takes the information from the MT4 and saves on a text file (values separated by semicolons). If you want, try it. The file generated is in the format: "GBPJPY at the start of the period, EURJPY at the start of the period, GBPJPY at the end of the period, the spread in the begining of the period, the maximum spread, the lower spread and the closing spread. Each data line corresponds to 5 minutes. To use it start MT4, start its DDE server (Tools &gt; Options &gt;DDE Server), turn the program on, click on "Register All". It will create a file and register the data. After u're finished u can stop the program, export data to excel and plot some graphic. I hope it helps. There are some words in portuguese on the text, but they are similar to the english counterparts.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
OK, just to keep things going here!! Looks like we just went through the "risk" part of this approach,.... that we get a sustained move that "uncorrelates" our currencies, then re-settles.... I traded this two ways: 1) Standard Synchline &amp; RSI entry, which signals the trade at a Synchline entry level, and determines direction by the RSI on the crosspair one time-frame higher. (&gt;50 buy GU, sell EU, opposite for &lt;50) This entry has me at -85p right now and did not exceed 100p negative during the whole move... not bad if this is "worse case". 2) Advanced "2nd RSI touch" entry. In this one, I get a trigger from SynchLine, at a given price difference, then again check the crosspair RSI at one time frame higher. But I only enter on a touch of the RSI movement from above the 70 or below the 30. This means that it is the 2nd touch, once to break the RSI, and the 2nd to go back. The thinking is to allow the market to reverse it's pair strengths, and return back towards our profit direction. This one has me at -29p. Not bad at all. But now, the pair difference seems to be settling in, perhaps for a new "synch". So, I could closeout for a loss, call it good, (this is not a bad option, really, for if this is our worse case, not bad!!), or leave it open to see if the Synch works it's way back (could take a long time...), or leave it open, but continue to trade at the new Synch Level it is establishing now... Very interesting!!

Here is the simplest way to trade with this strategy: Spread EU-GU in 90-95% looks like EUR/GBP chart, so on EG chart insert Bollinger bands with 200 period average and 2 and 3 standard deviations. If you look closely on EU, GU, EG, or any other chart you will see that almost always price bounce from 3rd standard deviation on every TF. How to trade: watch EG chart, when it's going up just wait for price to be between 2nd and 3rd StDev then you could SELL EU and BUY GU if you will loosing then add position on every 15-20 pips lost from last position. The same for EG in down trend. You can try with EG price touching 2nd StDev, then you will have more entry signals, but when trend will be strong then your entry will be too early and drawdown could be big. You can do backtests because Bollinger bands won't repaint.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Magic... got your PM... I have been using the CrossPair chart to determine direction as well... but using the RSI on the next time frame higher... But your BB idea looks great as well!! As a further update, my SynchPair position that I had just prior to the big drop last week just closed at +8p exiting at the SynchLine "ZeroLine" touch!!! This is great news. Clearly, I was on the wrong side of this move... 400p move!! We don't get those too often. At one point, I was -85p, but closed at +8p. So, if we can weather such a large move being on the wrong side, to come out at breakeven, we are doing pretty good. Now, there still is NO guarantee we will come out that way every time, but we know a couple of things: 1) This kind of 400p move, and it's corressponding wide de-correlation (or out of synch), does not happen very often. 2) There is always some sort of re-correlation move after the big move.. maybe not all the way to breakeven (this one was), but at least some sort of move. 3) Looks like a 100p MaxLoss would be a reasonable setting. 4) Even if we took a 100P loss, I have had (3) 30p wins since then, so in less than a week of this move, being on the wrong side, I would have paid back the loss. All in all, very encouraged...

Magictrader, Could you explain your entry strategy? Noiced they were taken at different times and always the same sell eurusd buy gbpusd.... and then most were closed around the same time..

--- 帖子 #573 ---
First I establish that spread between GU and EU is like normal distribution, so entries should be between -2 and +2 standard deviations (95% values in normal distribution are between +2 and -2 Standard deviations). So I've done in Excel standard deviations for GU-EU. When spread between GU-EU goes to +2 or -2 StDev then I look at cross pair EG, if there was up trend then I Sell EU and Buy GU, if downtrend then opposite. But what I noticed for EU, GU especially, that their spread almost looks like EG chart, so I just add 2,3,4 standard deviations from Bollinger bands 200 period average. But remeber we are trading spread between two pairs, not a cross pair. If you try to study other pairs, then you will see that e.g. spread between EU and AUD/USD looks more different from their cross pair EUR/AUD. So standard deviations for spread between two pairs will not be the same as for the cross pair, so different StDev = different entry points. But for EU, GU, you can use EG chart because in 90-95% it is the same as spread between them. ENTRY POINT: So your first entry point could be when EG is between 2nd and 3rd StDev (I use M5 chart - usually 1 to 2 trade signals per day). Agressive entry could be when price touches 2nd StDev, and conservative when price is at 3rd StDev. To know what to sell and what to buy simply look at EG chart and take opposite trades. DURING THE TRADE: There are two ways: First is to add positions when your first trades are loosing in total 15-20 pips. Then if your last positions again loosing 15-20 pips then add another positions and so on. If you are playing like this you should have maximal drawdown (e.g. 200 pips, when total loss hits -200 pips then close everything). Second is to open one pair of trades with less maximal drawdown, maybe about 50 pips. TAKE PROFIT: the best take profit point is when you enter at about -2,5 StDev and price now is at about +2 StDev (some kind of stop and reverse strategy). Other way is to exit when you reach your TP level e.g. you want to earn 20 pips, when you got it then close all. And last way of clossing positions is when you add more positions then you could close it on different StDev levels e.g. if your entry was at -2,5 then close some at -1,5, -1, 0 or choose another levels you want. TIPS: you can use for calculating StDev linear weighted average, it better follows strong trends and thanks to that entry point won't be to early. Below is the modified BB indicator. Hope this will help.

Very nice magictrader...congradulations on very smart method.

As I write Eur/Gbp is at about +3 standard deviations on 150 pd 30 min. single regression channel. This is a significant departure from median line. +3 SDs equates to a price of 0.7870 Eur/Gbp, while median line is 0.7797. At this point it must be determined which of the two curriencies is primarilly responsible for the divergence/decorrelation. Again single regression channel is used. I look at Yen crosses. Gbp/Jpy is nearly -3 SDs below the median line on 150 pd. 30 min. channel at 207.215, as I write. +3 SDs equates to a price of 207.031, while median line is 209.422. This is a significant departure from median line. On the other hand Eur/Jpy is remains near to it's median line of 163.248 on 150 pd. 30 min. single regression channel, at 163.16. There is little departure here, nothing significant, probably about -.25 SDs. Weakness in GBP, not strength in Euro, is primarilly responsible for the divergence/decorrelation and the large scale movement in the Eur/Gbp pair. In this case I will buy Gbp/Jpy and sell Eur/Jpy in proportion to their relative contributions to the state of divergence/decorrelation, and in proportion to their valuation to the Yen. Note Well! : when using regression channels it is necessary to keep in mind that they are always in a state of being drawn, and because of this, the distances of historical prices from the median line/SD lines were different at the time these prices were registered on the chart from where they appear at the time the current bar is being drawn. This is because the angle of the channel changes as the accumulation of price values becomes either more negative or more positive. This can be very misleading. Of course, this is not trading advice, just the way I trade this set-up...I hope this helps. Pippo

Today is very interesting day. Without SL technics we could clean out our accounts. Look at this strong trend on EG. Spread now is huge.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
hei everyone, any news? hows the result of your research? do you have other trading idea related to this technique?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I've found something safetier. I'm just calculating standard deviations for spread EU-UC. When it hits +2 or -2 I'm waiting for confirmation (usually candle formations on M5 or M15) then I pull the trigger only on EU. SL=25 pips TP=60 pips so it's nice R:R ratio without adding more positions, that's why it's safetier. Here are the statistics for last 8 signals (I start follow it last week): 5 x +60 pips 3 x -25 pips. Even with 30% of good signals it's still profitable. I'm counting on 50%-60% of good signals. In one day there are one or two signals.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi magictrader, what do you mine EU-UC ? EURUSD - ? what is the pier UC ? can you add a TPL ? or scrin pic' ? tanks

--- 帖子 #580 ---
benseg, Please try to type whole words next time. To supplement magictrader's post, and hopefully answer your question: EU means EURUSD UC means USDCHF By taking the difference, or ratio of prices between two well co-integrated pairs, you establish a much more stationary time series. That would be the EU-UC time series that magictrader is referring to. Of course, you must compensate for the fact that USDCHF's correlation with EURUSD is near -1, which means that when you calculate the price differential or ratio, you had better invert the USDCHF price to CHFUSD beforehand. Hope it helps, -Shuli

--- 帖子 #581 ---
UC is like shutopia write is USD/CHF. EUR/USD and USD/CHF are the best corrlelated pairs (I think). About -80% to -90% correlation. When their spread (EURUSD-USDCHF) comes to -2 or +2 value they should reverse. There is no template, you just need historical data, I use 200 M5 periods back and I calculate 200 average and 200 Standard Deviation. This is like Bollinger bands on M5 time frame with settings: 200 average and 2 StDev. But you can not add it to EUR/CHF because spread EURUSD-USDCHF is completely different from EUR/CHF. This are just tests, but I hope the results will be fine.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
How are you calculating standard deviation ?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
toddanderson, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I would like to know that too. Have you found out from magictrader or anyone how they are calculating the standard deviation? And the question is "the standard deviation" from what? Is it the standard deviation from 100% correlation of the euro and swissy? Or is he talking about an indicator that will take these values and place it on the EURCHF cross? I'm not too clear on what he is talking about, are you, toddanderson? It does sound like it has potential, though. pd

--- 帖子 #585 ---
wow..you really develop your technique.. nice to see it. Anyway, does it mean you trade only directional instead of hedging?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Can't speak on magictrader's method of calculating Standard Deviation, but in pairs trading, the generally accepted method involves taking the SD over anywhere between 10 and 30 bars (10 or 30 period) of the price differential (or price ratio) between your pairs. You certainly could take the moving standard deviation of EURCHF if your pairs are EURUSD and USDCHF.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Ok, I'll try to make it more clear. I think that hedging EU and GU is good method but there is more risk, because if EURGBP is in strong trend then it doesn't change anything that we are in hedge. Our lose could be big even with hedge. If we want to have good hedge EU GU then we need to predict EG moves which in 90-95% covers with our gains from pairs trading. So EU GU trading is very profitable when EG is in sideways trend or when we catch tops and bottoms. To catch it I use standard deviations (not perfect, but just add some Bollinger bands on EG chart with 200 average and 3 StDev then you will see how it usually bounce from 3rd StDev on every TF). And also max drawdown to close trades when they aren't in profit. So next, this idea could work on every highly correlated pairs. That's why I use now EURUSD and USDCHF (I think the best correlated pairs) which mirroring itself. To know what to do first I take 200 M5 bars back and I calculate difference between EU-UC on every signle bar (like SynchBars indicator). Next I calculate simple average from EU-UC, then from this 200 pariods I calculate standard deviation, then I multiply StDev by +2, +2,5, +3 and so on to +5. Then I add every level to simple average (so this are typical Bollinger Bands). SMA + 2 StDev, SMA + 2,5 StDEv and so on, and also SMA - 2 StDev... That would be great if there is possibility to add StDev to SynchBars indicator . Then we will have the same thing that I'm doing in Excel. Then when spread (EU-UC) goes over +2 StDev ot -2 StDev then there is a signal. I know that is far away from the Zeusjoes concept but for me and my account it's better because of less risk and good R:R ratio which could be set befor the trade. When we do pair trading we don't know what gain we could expect.

Here is even something like SwingMan does for us: http://daytradepairs.com/default.aspx

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi magictrader, I have pm'd Swingman, the man who programmed a lot of the indicators for this strategy. I asked him to take a look at what you are asking for. Maybe if he is not too busy he will be able to help us out. I don't have any indicators that show standard dev. bands but I have one that makes stDev channels. Take a look at it. It may be helpful. PD

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Thanks PistolDave. Maybe this will work also fine, I'm talking about SwingMans LogPriceDifference indicator. It looks like calculations in Excel. (LogPriceDiff is simillar to SynchBars). I set it up to period 200 (I think this is period from which are standard deviations calculated), and 2 StDev factor. SwingMan write how to use it, when to enter the trade and when to exit for pair trading. For less risk and better control of our transactions we can trade only one pair. I know this is not market nautral but it could work. But only use negative correlated pairs.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi, in July I posted two NeutralPrice indicators, from the Ehrmans book, but nobody used this tools, and I think they are very good. It's no problem to programe a new serie of indicators, with the ideas from magictrader, if you will this (please vote...). What I need is a description from what you will have.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hey, you are right SwingMan! I use in Excel the same things like it is in Andrew_e post #37 and even I don't know that . And also I'm calculating in Excel the same things like yours NeutralPriceOsc in post #417. Everything was here from the beggining .

--- 帖子 #595 ---
You are right, and I'm happy that nobody need new indicators from me...! .

--- 帖子 #596 ---
only my computer has a problem with calculating 200 period with NeutralPriceOsc? And also other periods, trading platfor is slowing down and I can't do anything. Do you have the same situation?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
No Problems. All Periods (also BB) are 200. - Entry if stdDev is above 3 and comes under the BB. Exit on zero. .

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Thanks, I'll try on new platform, maybe to many indicators on other screens.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
YES! For the period 200 you need CPU resources!

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Ok, I've got fresh new MT4 platform and it works ok. So this is one pair concept of using differences between two negative correlated pairs. As you can see it can predict tops and bottoms for one pair. With good MM and waiting for confirmation (Fibo, candle formations etc.) it will be profitable.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
was the log price differance indicator posted ? or can you post it i did search the paper clip Thank you

--- 帖子 #602 ---
It's in post #408. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=408

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Here is why it should works: (there are even divergences on standard deviations) Let's see if EU will go up...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Maybe yes, maybe no... - For the first three trades today, you win stress free(!) 95+27+85 = 207 Pips As observations: - The RSI is not a great help - For the correlation of the two pairs you can see what position must have the main line and the trigger line. If the distance between the lines is greather, also the win is greather... For your signal at 17:30: - The Price oscillator isn't below the lower Bollinger Band - The oscillator value is over 3 std.dev. - RSI is OK - The corellation distance is very small. Win potential is under 30 pips... .

--- 帖子 #605 ---
I agree, but there is also possibility to make transaction only for one pair to minimize risk. Signals are great. What SL do you recommend? Where is Hedging Hedge Correlation indicator because I can't find it? Thanks SwingMan. EDIT: ok, got it http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...4&amp;postcount=94

--- 帖子 #606 ---
this is my latest trade (It's more "aggresive" entry because like SwingMan write, StDev was not below -3 and BB) But I saw some XABCD patterns, Fibo levels (green fields) and candle formation. Now for over +30 pips, SL is on BE so stress free trade. I'm waiting for the average or for +60 pips.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Trade close for +40 pips because it was so close to middle line. Let's see what will happen tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
OK, I'm going also sleeping with other 64 pips. 2,700$ is enough for today... My trade, with your entry point: .

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Great to see that you finaly found time to earn the fruits of your programming.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
A very interesting comment from me, please think about : Today, in the SpielersHedge strategie we have a divergence above 0.50%, with two short entrys and without wins until now. In the same time, with my indicators we have one short and three long trades, with 270 pips win. I don't believe that SH can achieve this...

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Nice to hear that. SwingMan what are your settings for HHCorrelation? Mine is so "flat".

--- 帖子 #612 ---
It coud be, because the correlation is flat. From time to time you must restart the correlation indicator. It repaints, and I haven't time to solve this problem. .

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Backtests should reveal that pairs trading spot FX instruments can perform exceptionally well when the spread is range bound. What approaches have you guys taken when the spread is in a major trend?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
SwingMan, RE:270 pips win: Is this taking only the EURUSD position short (one) and EURUSD position long (three) or is it taking both EURUSD and USDCHF short at the same time? Or is it taking the EURCHF position these four times? I am not clear on this. Thanks, Bruce

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I calculated for EURUSD long with USDCHF short, and for EURUSD short with USDCHF long (pair hedging). If you take only one pair, this is your risk...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
SwingMan, Long EU and Short UC it's not a hedge. L EU and L UC is a hedge, that's why I'm trying to trade only one pair. Shutopia, that's why I try to use spread information like a signal that "something could happen on the market". I'm not using it like eg moving average system when green cross red then you enter the market. My methodology looks like this: waiting for |2|, |3| StDev (works like an alarm), check Fibo retracements, extensions, measure it from different highs and lows, looking for ABCD and XABCD patterns, for the last but not least I'm waiting for confirmation with candle formations on different time frames (M5, M15, M30, H1). So in this one trade I putt all my knowledge of the market. P.S now I'm looking for short EU because of it was in almost 3rd StDev and now on H1 is big reversal formation.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Here is the trade (StDev going back from almost +3): (if I'm wrong then no problem I'll wait for next opportunity, but I know that I do everything for correct trade).

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Yup. Thought of that all the time. It's logic. Both are inverse correlated. If you are Long EU and it moves up you make money. Your short UC will probably go down making money as well. If the opposit happens you lose money on both. The funny thing is when you are Long EU and UC you gain interest on both and you are hedged! I have 1 Lot EU and 1.5 Lots UC open for weeks and it keeps collecting swap while max DD was only 50 pips. @SwingMan If I load NeutralPrice Osc. and the RSI both with 200 Period setting MT4 instantly crashes. Any thoughts why? I don't think that it's to much calculation for my PC. Has to be a problem with MT4.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I've got the same problem with platform and I dl new MT4 from different broker and I remove all the screens and indicators only left "Neutral" indicators and it works ok.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
SL on +20 pips. I think that this strategy is the one that I was looking for all the time. It combines a lot of technics and that's why it could be very profitable because a lot of traders look at different things. In this strategy we look almost at everything: Pairs trading, Fibo trading, Patterns trading, Candle formations trading etc.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
one more trade before the news (spread touch +2). EDIT: SL hit, but from previous transaction when we will close it at the middle line it was over 40 pip gain. Let's see what happen next...

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi So now you do not take hedge trades just directional ones

--- 帖子 #624 ---
now when I understand how hedge trade works eg L EU and S GU I know that it's not so safety way to trade. In 90-95% our gain depends from EUR/GBP moves. So in 90-95% we're trading EG. But I saw that there is possibility to use pairs trading (hedging) principal for directional trading. This way of trading is more safe for me. But it's out of this thread so I will post only things about hedging.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
yap..i notice that too..but the problem is when we trade directional, we have to choose between sell the stronger or buy the weaker..we dont really know weather one currency become too strong or become too weak...when it happens, we lose...on the other hand hedging can eliminate that kind of problem but when the spread in EG become higher than we lose as well.. i've tested the method to solve this problem..but i need to backtest it first...

--- 帖子 #626 ---
this is a demotrade, using swingmans NeutralPriceOscillator time is CET long EURUSD 14828 long USDCHF 10890 at 15:10 closed both ca. 5:00 this morning with nice profit i also dit a Spieler Hedge trade with mini Lot size, almost the same result. The only diference i can see is, the entry with swingmans Oscillator is more correct cause it shows you the correlation of EURUSD and USDCHF. Spieler follows the EURCHF moves from the start of the day and thats different with any broker. Some use GMT , im with oanda , they use NY ET., so what time should one take?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hello, I don't want to change topic of this thread but you could try strategy with H1 candles on EU and Neutral Price Oscillator set up like this: Pair 1: EURUSD Pair 2: USDCHF maxBars: 300 Period_Differences: 200 BB_Period: 200.0 BB_Deviation: 2.0 Time Frame for indicator: M5 When you have indicator over +2 or below -2 then simply look at H1 EU chart and wait for confirmation to reverse. I use only 4 candlestick patterns: mornig star, evening star, piercing formation and dark cloud cover. Entry on the next H1 candle or wait for pull back. I use 25-30 pips SL and 50-60 pips TP. I move my SL when position is in profit, usually when +20,25 to BE, and when +40,45 to +20. If you have time, just try it. EDIT: results from last signals: +20, +50, +20, +50, -25, +50, +50 and today I've made +41 pips (+7 SL, and +34 closed manually because of the news in few minutes).

--- 帖子 #628 ---

can someone tell me why when i put the neutral price oscillator on my chart it freezes my screen. i have tried to use it with ibfx demo and fxdd demo on 2 diff computers and they both freeze up any ideas??? it says not responding

--- 帖子 #639 ---
pls magictrader can you send the same info to my inbox too thks in advance

--- 帖子 #640 ---
The NPO will freeze your MT4 if you're using 200 Period Differences and let it calculate the past 500 Bars. Set Bars to 50.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
or simply download new MT4 platform and delete all screens and indicators. Just leave NP oscillator and one EU chart.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Here are some charts with EURUSD CHFUSD EURCHF and EURUSD GBPUSD EURGBP. We can see that for this strategy the best pairs are EURUSD and USDCHF. They are the best correlated pairs. You can try also EURJPY and CHFJPY.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Daily correlation GBP/JPY vs EUR/JPY is 95.2%. Daily correlation EUR/USD vs USD/CHF is 99.0% (inverse). H1 correlation GBP/JPY vs EUR/JPY is 97.7%. H1 correlation EUR/USD vs USD/CHF is 89.8%. Looks like E/U vs U/CHF will offer more trading opportunities and will have a greater likelihood of returning to normal state than G/J vs E/J.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Everything works when spread has normal distribution. If not, then this strategy will bring loss. But I think EUR and CHF pairs looks closer to normal distribution then EUR and GBP pairs.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
If someone interested I'm still trading with Neutral Price Oscillator and EURUSD-USDCHF spread. Works great with very good accuracy. Now I add one more filter for more confident entry. It looks like this: If we're using EURUSD-USDCHF spread then when we're looking for reversal candlestick pattern it has to appear at the same time on EU and UC. This is something like correlation indicator. If on EU appear e.g. morning star then on UC at the same time should appear evening star. E.g. if on EU appears some pattern, but on UC not, then wait for UC to confirm. When two patterns appears on EU and UC at the same time and Neutral Price gives signal, then this is signal for trade with very good probability of win. End what is important, this strategy works well with strong trend on EU and UC like yesterday end today.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Magictrader, Could you post some screen shots showing examples of what you mentioned? Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #647 ---
No problem, it looks like this:

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Magictrader, Thanks. Now I can see what you are looking for. Bruce

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Todays example: spread was at -3 and going back, but only UC confirm the entry, EU not. Now I'm waiting for EU H1 to close above red line (50% of down candle) to open long.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Hello Magictrader, i know, I've just sent you a pm asking you about the details of your hedging system up to today since I have gotten confused reading all the posts. it is very difficult for me to evaluate useful from not so useful. I realize that the system is developing and more details have recently been added, like eg the opposite candlestickformations. It would be helpful to people that sideenter this thread to get an updated explanation about the principle and details of this hedging strategy. In order not to get lost in the thread. And also in order to start contibuting without making mistakes over some information that might have slipped. Thank you in advance Regards

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi, first of all now I don't hedge. I just use principal from pair trading to directional trading because for me having two positions open is to much and to risky. Principal looks like this: if the difference between two pairs going to +2 or -2 standard deviations then they should reverse. But they don't have to, so I use candlestick patterns for reversal confirmation. If spread between EU-UC goes to -2 then I'm looking to go long on EU and if someone want also to go short on UC. But we need a confirmation. Candlesticks patterns are very common and they works ok. We need also correlation because only when we have correlation this strategy works. So simple indicator of correlations will be the same candlestick patterns on correlated pairs. To know at which standard deviation spread is I use Neutral Price Oscillator by SwingMan set up like this: Pair 1: EURUSD Pair 2: USDCHF maxBars: 300 Period_Differences: 200 BB_Period: 200.0 BB_Deviation: 2.0 Time Frame for indicator: M5. I use 25 pips SL on EU and 50 pips TP, but I think to change to 30 SL and 30 TP. I do some backtests and it looks that with 30 pips TP accuracy of this strategy = about 85%. With 10 pips TP = 99%. I think that's all. Happy testing and trading. P.S. I'm looking for long now. At night there were also some short signal, so this is not only counter trend strategy.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Dear Magictrader, How do you know to go long EURUSD? Why not go short USDCHF? In short, is there a way of knowing which is the better pair to trade by its relative weakness or strength? ---I believe this question was asked by someone earlier in the thread. Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi Magictrader, thank you for the explanation. Probably that's why I did not understand, because I focussed on a hedge all the time. I will try your system. Thanks again. Regards

--- 帖子 #654 ---
If we based on correlation then there should be no difference. Of course in practice there is difference because of cross pair EURCHF moves. The best way is to go long and short on this pairs, but it is too risky for me so I only use EU. Today was a perfect signal to go long on EU and short on UC.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Nice signal for short EU and long UC. I've just grab 10 pips from EU and going to sleep. Let's see how it develops during Asian session...

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I've done some summary of the latest 9 signals (from last 6 days) and 7 signals from this week till todays morning. Entry on candle open (arrow marked). Looks like the best score is when TP=30 pips and SL also 30 pips without moving SL. 7 from 9 transactions end on TP. 7x 30 2x -30 overall: +150 pips, 16,66 pips per transaction, 25 pips per day, 77% accuracy. Also very interesting is when TP=10 and SL=25 pips. Then all 9 transactions end on TP, so accuracy = 100%. I know that is less then 30 pips TP but this accuracy is very cool.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Magictrader, Thanks for the summary... Did you take any of those trades on demo or live? If so which ones? Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #658 ---
of course. From 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th September. But usually I was stopped out bacause I move my SL very quickly to BE. Now I'm thinking of use more lots with 10 pips TP. Because I don't like to wait few hours for end of the trade . Even when SL will be hit, then I know that this strategy has bigger potential, so on next trade I can set 30 pips TP and cover my loss.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
30 minutes befor NFP was a signal to go long on EU. Another pips gained. I will mark all my entries on the chart by arrows to easy make summary ans statistics in the future. Happy trading. EDIT: I've made some more backtests. I take last 14 signals that I saw, and 10 pips were in profit 14 times! 100% accuracy. One tip: if candle is about 50 pips high, then wait for pull back, because we don't want big stop loss and with this kind of candles SL should be at about 40 pips but it's to risky to take only 10 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Another 10 pips after strong up movement on EU and down on UC spread come to +2, so I was waiting for down movement on EU. Evening star formed on EU earlier, so I wait for confirmation on UC which appears later. This is fascinating 15 times on 15 signals. 10 pips per trade is enough with this accuracy. I think I should make a journal to don't mess the thread.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi, Magictrader, hi all, From this thread(and the other) i'm using the same indi as you, combined with another trustfully indi that i found somewhere(don't remember where), it's called Fisher m11.... I have made over 25 transactions this week on EURUSD (with Swing Man Neutral oscilator, your settings, M5) and EURAUD (with Fisher_m11, default settings, H1), all of them positive (100%) , both in my live and demo accounts. I don't use too often candlestick patterns, if the trade goes against me a number of pips(at least 100 pips/or at first reversal 2nd signal) i average my position with double lots. But i don't know if was 1 or 2 trades that we're going wrong at the beggining. I'm attaching the indi, AND A SCREENSHOT OF MY LIVE ACCOUNT PLATFORM AT CLOSING TIME (this will go to IBFX too for explanations).Please notice the huge discrepancies between prices of the open trades and prices from the market view....Ex. GBPJPY market view 189.10, GBPJY open trade 187.58...?????????

Dear Magictrader, How is your method holding up? Any additional inputs you're looking at? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi, yes, there are some inputs which works very good. Now when reversal formation appears TP=30 pips after entry on next H1 candle EU. Then if price goes in opposite direction about -15 pips then I add another lot. Then my TP=30 pips from average entry price, and SL=30 pips from average entry price. Trade time is from London open to about half of US session (London close +1 hour to +2 hours). I've done 3 weeks bactesting and 2 weeks of real forward testing and results are very good. Accuracy = about 90%. Maximal drawdown in this hours = -90 pips (-60 +30 -60). If you want to play every signal, then maxDD=-240 pips (-60 -60 -60 -60). 4 bad trades in a row (but that was last friday, day befor all this bad news, so this could be the reason). Average daily signals =1,5 signal per day. In this strategy I see very big potential when market back to normal conditions, but even in this high volatility period this strategy works ok with positive balance.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Dear Magictrader, In your opinion, what is the ideal timeframe chart for the best combination of accuracy and trade signal frequency? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #665 ---
In this strategy we use candlestick patterns for confirmation, so smaller TF = less accuracy larger TF = better accuracy (not H4 because in every time zone they look different). I like H1 candles because they give reliable signals, nice reward and we can look at charts only once at few minutes befor H1 close. For me this is ok, because of only 1 to 2 trades per day with nice profit.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Which patterns do you use, other than Evening and Morning Stars?

--- 帖子 #667 ---
and piercing pattern and dark cloud cover.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi, this is example from todays morning. Two good trades in a row with 30pips and 30pips x2 lots profit. Hope it is easy to understand what I mean . Of course spread was first over +2 and then going down but price going up so there were divergence between spread and price. That's why go short. I saw also that in trend following formations confirmation from spread is good when the value of spread is about zero. But at the beginning it's easier to play only one side of the market.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
And this is how it looks on spread chart:

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hello Magictrader, I use eSignal and not MT4. Is there a way of duplicating the spread function on eSignal: perhaps dividing the EURUSD by the USDCHF (or subtracting one from the other) and then sticking BBs around that? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hi, I don't use on my real account MT4 also, I've got DealBook360. Oscillator works on one of demo MT4 accounts. Download some MT4 demo and add this indicator.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
what is a good setting for neutral price osc ? The setting given previously makes my mt4 hang. I guess than period have to be like around 40 in order not to hang for my computer. Any suggestion for the setting ?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Dear Magictrader, Am I wrong in thinking that you actually have a good trading system here? Am I wrong to think that you seem to have your act together? Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hi, I think that this system works very well, because it connects few ways of trading. If we know that pair trading (market neutral) works because there is some spread between two highly correlated currencies, stocks, or something else and we enter the market when spread is big and start to reverse. We never know is it that big that couldn't be bigger. But for reverse with high probability we can use candlestick formations, that's why I think this system works very well. Big spread + reverse confirmation.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Hi, because now I can't trade with that strategy on H1 (another year on Universtiy) so I'll try smaller version with M15 TF (I can trade on afternoons). Everything is 4 times smaller, so H1 to M15, 200 M5 period Neutral Price to 50 M5 period (250 M1 should be the same but slower work and could crash MT4). Also TP and SL are smaller (but maybe not four times, TP = 10 to 15 pips. But also there should be more signals, so this strategy could be more profitable then the previous one. If the accuracy will be the same (H1 has about 90% accuracy). But I'm also waiting for normal volatility, 100 - 120 pips a day, not 300 - 400 pips .

--- 帖子 #676 ---
magictrader, Please keep us updated how it goes with this adjustment in time frames that you are making. Bruce

--- 帖子 #677 ---
No problem, I've take smaller time frame because when I'm not at home on H1 appears only 1 or 2 signals per day so I can miss it. With smaller TF there will be more signals, so when I'm at home I can trade it, with some backtests it looks ok. But still volatility is high so it is very difficult to set appropriate SL and TP.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Dear friends: I still can not understand what is the entry rule. couldyou please write something or post some charts. regards

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Dear Magictrader, So, how's it going? Wishing you well. Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi, everything looks ok, but still volatility is unpredictible so it's hard to adjust TP and SL. Now I can trade only on thursdays, so I'll forward test it on real account only in this days and I'll post my statements. For now I'll use TP and SL = 15 pips.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
with your technique, suppose i enter the position after the deviation goes above level 3 (using swingman - neutralprice indi), does the risk is managable? i mean even the volatility is high.... i am thinking to hedge it with usd/chf...so when the level goes to +3/-3 then i will waiting for eur to give a reverse candle stick signal (on 5 min chart) and rather than put SL,i put usd/chf as a hedge.. Anyway, i have trying to put different style of trading this indi..but i think your technique is still the best one...thumbs up..

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Here it is my latest trade (three days free so I can trade all day long). When NPO hits -2 then on EU appears morning star formation, but UC doesn't confirm it (decorrelation). So wait for good signal even if NPO is above -2. Then on EU and UC appears two opposite formations - morning star and evening star (correlation is ok). So I take entry on next candle. Using fractal construction of the market it should also works on M5 candles (for those who like fast trades). Every setting just devide by three (M15 to M5 is 3:1 proportion). I don't know why starting parameter of 200 period on M5 works well on H1 candles and it looks that it works also if we use fractals.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Thank you Magic, the image is very helpfull

--- 帖子 #684 ---
No problem . I'm still trying how to adjust TP and SL, and my though is to do like this: simply let the market tells us where to put TP and SL. Just put SL 1 pip above/below last higher high/lower low (we're using candle revarsal formations so price shouldn't go higher or lower), then measure the distance from entry point to the SL and put TP in the same distance from entry. This looks very fair to the market and maybe it will work ok. Each trade will have different risk level, but risk to reward always will be near 1. Tomorrow I will do some trades with this principal.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Here it is the trade with 50/50 chance. For NOP I use 83 period on M1 candles (spread was over +2) and TF M5 for formations (day trading system). This are still the same proportions from original 200 NOP M5 period on H1 candles.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I had tried various setting with NPO but it still make my MT4 hanged. Is there any alternative?

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Download new MT4 and clear everything except this indicator and chart. I've got 200 period on M5 and it works ok, but I need to wait few seconds for loading. I've got some new idea about SL. In first H1 strategy TP and SL was about 30-40 pips. I saw that in some bad trades (SL hit) price spike up hitting SL and then go back in our direction. So my idea is to have time SL. Just pull the trigger when signal appears, set alarm on SL place and if alarm rings that should mean that SL could be hit. But there wasn't SL. So simply wait for this H1 candle to close. If it hit TP in this hour then ok, if not then close the trade at closing of H1 candle. Thanks to that we shouldn't loose 30-40 pips but less, because price will bounce back. (History shows that). So this is only crazy idea how to minimize average loss.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
hello magic Do you think that its also possible to trade with your approuch daily timeframe.And can you help to adapt like you did for 15 min tf for daily. the settings for the swingman indicator. thanks very intresting thread i like thanks LODOL

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Hi, i think it is possible, I never try it because there should be also bigger SL and it's not for my account (to big risk). But you can try it and share with the results . Also this is counter trend system, so when the market is trending then on daily chart, signal could appear after few days (or week), this is also not for me . For H1 which works ok it is 200 period M5 (16,66 hours). For D1 could be 100 period of H4 candles (400 hours). Proportion is 24:1. Maybe it will work. Now I'm thinking to use M30 charts for faster entry, when I look at history trades then there were better entry points using M30.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
hi thanks magic for support i will try regards lodol

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi everyone. I have a couple questions about the NeutralPrice Oscillator. 1. What does the input, "Period_Differences" mean? 2. What is the recommended setting for Period_Differences? The default seems to be 34. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
dear Swingman, Hows going? Do u program this Neutralprice for positive correlation pairs?(your post in number 417) If im not mistaken, to calculate this u have to subtract one pair to another and find the mean of those. But for negative correlation, i think u should do the other way because they move in opposite direction. Instead of subtract it, u have to add it...what do u think? thanks

--- 帖子 #693 ---
For positive correlation pairs simply use Bollinger Bands on cross pair like EUR/GBP. This is the same as Neutral Price Oscillator for EURUSD and GBPUSD. But for negative correlated pairs like EURUSD and USDCHF, Bollinger Bands for EURCHF are not the same as NPO for EURUSD and USDCHF.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
so it means we can not use NPO for EURUSD and USDCHF? at least they way we do it right now using level as the sign to enter the market...

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I use it for EURUSD USDCHF and it works ok, but for positive correlated pairs like EURUSD and GBPUSD it works the same as Bollinger Bands on cross pair.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Hi Magictrader, May I ask how you use the Bollinger Bands? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Hi, I don't use BB's. Andrie mention something about NPO for positive correlated pairs and this is the same as BB's on cross pair. That was just a thought .

--- 帖子 #698 ---
ehm...if im not mistaken u use it as a sign for reversal combine it with candle stick patern..But in this case which pair do u use? EURUSD or USDCHF? last night EURUSD shows reversal patern but instead of going up, it keeps going down...

--- 帖子 #699 ---
For trade I use EURUSD only to minimize risk. But revarsal formations should appear on EU and UC, not only on EU. It's not 100% strategy, but 80-90% and also wait for normal volatility (over 300 pips per day on EU it's sick), now markets are unpredictable and don't care about anything.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
hi magic trader you still trade with this method? any news update? regards lodol

Is that what killed the thread, the high volatility of this "apocalyptic crunch"? Or u all founding fathers doin fine with this method? arb is how lotta hedge funds make killin...

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Going back to the original thought of Zeusjoes and others $$$$$

--- 帖子 #708 ---
hello BigB@ang, may i know how you get the eur/usd and usd/chf prices to overlap on your chart ? it's very helpful in deciding when to enter and exit. many thanks.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Going LONG on EURUSD and SHORT on USDCHF or SHORT on EURUSD and LONG on USDCHF is very dangerous. If the USDCHF goes bearish or bullish big time (which it will) and you are on the wrong side, will more than likely destroy your bank as EURUSD will not be able to keep up. You may have a win ratio of 99% but that killer 0.1% trade will come at some point!!!!

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I've read through the whole thread and it seems to have 3 different systems contained within it. mrkam, swingman and magictrader have all provided great input with regards to their systems. however, it would be great if they could clarify each of their 3 systems so we all have a clear understanding of how to use them and whether they still work as expected. hope you guys are still following this to reply. cheers.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Does anybody here know of an indicator like the one posted here that will give you the past readings of the overlay chart? I want to run my mouse over the past couple of hours and get data (closing prices) for both pairs on the chart, so that I don't have to switch back and forth between chart pairs. Anybody know how to do that?

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Also, I am looking for an EA that can close all trades based upon total number of pips acquired. Does anyone know where I might find that? I seem to remember a Swiss Army Knife EA or something that could do that. Maybe I'll search for that, unless anyone has any other suggestions. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I'm sure there was one posted in one of the correlation threads. Maybe by swingman or drkam. How many pips are you grabbing daily with your overlay strategy DL?

--- 帖子 #714 ---
I can't seem to find one, I've been looking. If anyone else finds one please let me know. What I do is at the start of the day (5:00 PM EST on FXDD) I open a long order on both EUR/JPY. When they get out of correlation by 50 pips I open the live orders. I then close when 100 pips in profit. Works daily. I just need an EA to close so that I don't have to monitor every hour.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Thanks @Parky that you mention me. That is however a too simple task for me... I use an MTF EA with 28 correlated pairs on 4 time frames, plus other 28 correlations of single trend strenghts... In one or two weeks I experience whether also bring wins...

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Sorry, can you please clarify this. 1. you open a long order on BOTH eur/jpy. Do you mean you buy long eur/usd and usd/yen positions at start of day? 2. when you get out of correlation by 50 pips you open live orders. I thought you had already opened a position in step 1. If I find that ea I will forward it to you. I'm sure I saw it over the past couple of days as I was trawling through these correlation threads. thanks.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Good luck matey.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Swingman, you've always been gracious to provide us with great indicators. Any chance you could make one that shows the data (closing prices) of each currency on the chart? For instance, I'm just wanting to get closing data for EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY, each hour, for the past several months. In other words, just roll the mouse over the candle, like we do now to get the data, but have it give me data for both the pairs mentioned above. This way we don't have to switch charts back and forth, lose our place, try to find it again, get the data, then do the same for the other chart. Any chance you could make a simple indicator that does this?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Sorry, I should have clarified this better. I open the 2 long orders on a demo account, just to determine when the currencies have diverged more than 50 pips. You could also sell both, because all we care about is when they diverge. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Try this indicator from the Metaquotes Online-Bibliothek: .

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Swingman, thank you for trying. I already had that indicator and it does not anywhere give you the data (closing price) of the overlaying chart. It does paint a grid on the chart so you can guess what the closing price is, but it is just a guess. I'm looking for an indicator that when you put your mouse over the candle it says something like this: EUR/JPY: 136.02 GBP/JPY: 159.67 Any other suggestions?

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I have posted many indicators for correlated pairs, and more complicated as two closes... Here is one from the Spielers thread: .

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. I've said it before, and I'm sure I'll say it again, thank you Swingman.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hello Dreamliner as far as i remeber this one did something similar, you may need to modify the code.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi Dreamliner, did you find your EA to close all trades when a specific amount has been reached? Also, do you just set a SL on each trade so you know the maximum loss you will take. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I don't want to highjack this thread, but since here is not too much activity these days, you can check dreamliner thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=160912 I'm posting there my charts and also articles and info on this method of trading.

no post since 2010?? what happend to this thread? hows it going with the EA? any progress?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
I have created an EA using Swingman's indicator~~ NeutralHedge osc_v3.4.ex4‎ NeutralHedge Overlay_v4.ex4‎ The basic ideas of the EA was that when the HedgeRange between the two pairs reached 400(Adjustable) It will instantly enter two orders (direction will be depended by the Indicator). Lot size for these two orders sometimes will be the same sometimes not, it all depends on the contract size or market value for each currency pair. Eg. AUDUSD = 10.00 x 1.03423 = 10.3423 NZDUSD = 10.00 x 0.79808 = 7.9808 (difference 29.58%) AUDUSD = 10.00 x 1.03423 = 10.3423 NZDUSD = 12.96 x 0.79808 = 10.3431 (difference 0.007%) I'm trying to make my trades go in the same ratio once they merge. So I will gain profit everytime they merge regardless of which way they move. Increase Positions Average loss per 0.1 lots before increase position It means that another set of orders will enter when the average loss per 0.1 lots has reached (which is -15 adjustable) I also used martingale when increase those positions. Eg. 1st set AUDUSD @ 0.1 lots NZDUSD @ 0.13 lots 2nd set AUDUSD @ 0.2 lots NZDUSD @ 0.26 lots 3rd set AUDUSD @ 0.4 lots NZDUSD @ 0.52 lots you get the idea... I didnt really set a limit to how many orders it will increase though. (well.. its 100sets) the reason why I use martingale here is because I dont really want to exit when the range goes back to zero, I tried this, Its just too unstable. Therefore by using martingale, if the pair merges alittle bit, I will start making money! Exit strategy The only exit strategy I use was that if the average winning $ per 0.1 lot was reached, all orders will be closed. (which was $10 also adjustable) I have fixed the currency to AUD/USD and NZD/USD, feel free to test it for other currencies if you know how to modify the codes. The timeframe is M5. By The way, Yes, these two indicators repaints, but It doesnt matter, because we dont need the datas from the past, this EA works on the latest bar only. I think thats it for now, please feel free to comments on anything and play around with the codes. Thank you all for your time. Johnny PS. The settings for indicators is SubSymbol NZDAUD Pair_Mirroing -1 Period_Range 205 others are default. Ps2. Special thanks to Swingman. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU NEED NeutralHedge osc_v3.4.ex4 in your indicator's folder in order for EA to work!!!

I have been trading correlated pairs with this neutral hedge indicator and overlay for about a year now. I have had pretty good results - when I stick to my rules. My problem was that I would often miss trades because I cannot be at my pc all the time, so I would end up taking trades late or early because I had to leave for work. I tinkered around a bit but could not figure out how to make an EA to trade like I do - so I am SO GLAD that you have created one. I was entering trades manually when the pairs diverted enough to reach the hedge range lines. Once in a position, I was using and EA to exit the trades once they hit my profit target for the "basket" (combined profit of both pairs). This has bee working pretty well. I trade off the 15 minute chart and I set my profit target at $30-$45 for each 0.1 lot position depending on the pairs. I was monitoring/trading 12 correlated pairs, but I have narrowed it down to 8 for now. I really look forward to testing your EA !!!! Can you run backtests with the ea? THANKS.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
big thnx to quakr for creating the EA :-) hi DojiMojo : if it's ok with you, cud u plz post the 8 corelated pairs that you now use ? we can then start testing each of those pairs and see how it goes ... cheers

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Sorry for the delay - it's been a hectic week. I have traded different pairs over time, depending on the market. If I am lucky enough to notice that a pair is not acting "normal" I will avoid trading that pair or possibly just trade with smaller lots. The top 8 pairs currently are: AUDUSD-AUDCAD, NZDUSD-AUDCAD, EURUSD-AUDUSD, USDCHF-USDCAD, EURUSD-NZDUSD, EURUSD-GBPUSD, EURAUD-EURNZD, EURUSD-USDCHF. I have traded several others, but for now these were the best performers. Cheers.....

I think this strategy can be the holy grail Really It needs a EA and the "Going Home" EA from SteveHopewood is a good one, i am trying to modify this EA to work with the NeutralHedge OSC v3

--- 帖子 #743 ---
What has happened to this thread? The last post says something about this strategy being "the Holy grail".... then nothing. I don't know about the "Holy grail", but the strategy does have merit, making money almost very day on a few selected pairs. Thanks to two extremely generous traders/coders (SwingMan and Spieler), we have plenty of tools to do the job. I also have developed an EA that I "may" be willing to share (but not sell). Let me summarise what I think this thread is all about. I may not have it 100% correct, but you should be able to get the gist of it. Someone by the name of Zeusjoes started the thread and it was about trading the spread between (mostly) uncorrelated pairs. In particular, he was trading (or thinking of trading EURUSD and USDCHF. Long one and short the other. This caused a bunch of punters to ask, "why not just trade EURCHF?". If one more person asks that question, I'm jumping off the bridge. Along the way, "Spieler" entered the thread with thoughts about trading more correlated pairs (EURUSD/GBPUSD). Instead of one long and one short position, his approach was to go long both (or short both) when his indicator gave the signal. Since Spieler's approach was somewhat the opposite of SwingMan's approach, Spieler was encouraged to start another thread. We now have two threads (this one and http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=95721 ). SwingMan even took the time to develop an EA (now in it's eighth version) to trade Spieler's methodology. To me, neither approach is pure "hedging", but I don't wish to debate it. There is still much to discuss on this thread. I have carefully read every post and urge anyone thinking they might like to trade this strategy to start at the beginning of the thread and read every post. I hope that we can get this going again. The strategy does make money almost every day. My biggest problem is what to do when there is an anticipated high impact news event. Stop trading? Wait longer? Go to Florida? Whatever. I should tell you that my trading is 100% mechanical. I do NOT watch charts. Candles, Shooting Stars, Fibonacci, Gann.... all science fiction in my view. I have too many other things to do (developing better EA's, for instance) to watch charts. I need to have EA's that automaticaly cater for every situation. Enough said. Where to from here?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Personally, if I had an EA capable of trading on its own with consistent positive results, I'd head straight for Italy to buy my new Ferrari.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Consistent, yes.... and no. Looking for thoughts on how to trade through scheduled major news events. Also looking for ideas for better detection of "out of sync" situations that present arb opportunities. Not a one-way street. Very happy to share my own findings. I was asleep at the wheel on Friday when "something" hit the markets. I assume it was NFP? It caused significant drawdowns that are very slowly recovering. Recovering from drawdowns is stressful and time consuming, taking funds away from new trades.

Dear Shiva, You'll have to change the magic number for ea currency pairs if you wish to run multiple pairs all at once. So that the EA wont affect other trades. Johnny

There is a reason the thread is dead. It works UNTIL the carry trade starts to unwind. When that happens then your account will blow BIG TIME. Now, many will ask, "Just don't trade when the carry trade starts to unwind", well, good luck with spotting that when it occurs. Usually around 4-6 times per year but depends on other factors which retail traders are not normally informed about. So, ofcourse, you can make some nice profits in the meantime. But not having some kind of stoploss across both pairs is a disaster waiting to happen when the carry trade starts to unwind. You will end up with both trades staying negative for days, weeks, months etc. Your broker will margin call your account. Unless ofcourse you are trading 0.01 with a 100,000K account. And god forbid the USD devalues. Then you really will be changing your underpants. Scoobs.

Many thanks for the warning Scoobs. Can you share any guidelines of stoploss you may set if you traded this method? FYI, my profit target is marginal like 1 to 2 dollars for 0.01 lot each traded with ibfx micro lot account (suffix m) managed by an EA, which is about 40 to 50 pips move, net of traded pairs. Thanks, Akira

I would set each one based on its daily range over 5, 10 and 20 days. Now, yes, that's not a very good R:R ratio if your TP is &lt; 50 pips etc but its better than not setting it to something. Many in the past used this method to trade EURUSD and USDCHF. When it works then yes you will make lots of small profits relative to your account balance. But if the Swiss, Europe or USA decides to devalue or manipulate their currencies then you will get wiped out in a short period of time. Back in 2012 a large Swiss hedge fund sold its Swiss francs and bought USD which left allot of people trading this method with one big headache. When the carry trade unwinds then the CHF will not be able to keep up with the USD moves. Basically your SELL trade goes negative and so does your BUY trade. If they were positively correlated, then they become un-correlated and vice versa. You can end up losing 700 pips in a few hours. That usually happens on a Friday afternoon a certain points in a trading year. Spotting it however is rather troublesome. For that reason, if you are going to use this method, then makesure you have some kind of stoploss and do not trade it on any Friday. If you have trades open going into a Friday then close them out and start again on Monday morning. Having said that, any kind of trading on a Friday when USA comes on-line is potentially dangerous depending on the economic calendar. Have a look what happened today with trading this method using GBPUSD and EURUSD. The GBP nearly fell off a cliff and the EUR wouldn't have been able to keep up to negate your other losing trade. Scoobs.

Points well taken. Re. GBPUSD-EURUSD today, my chart didn't show a meaningful disparity (1st chart) during Asian market hours (my zone), hence didn't trade this paring. And as you say, after London - NY, the picture turned completely different. But it seems the huge disparity disappeared toward the NY close (2nd chart). This GBP fell off did affect my other method to a large extent. Thanks again Scoobs for your kind input. Akria

Well, according to my average daily range calculation AUDUSD is 88pips and NZDUSD is 76pips. using 1,5,10,20 combined average range. So use the higher one of the two and set both stoplosses to 88pips (4 digit broker). Will be interesting to see how much profit you can make using this method before one or both hit their stoploss values. Scoobs.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Thank you Scoobs for your continued attention. I used the attached indicator that gives ATR and set it for 10 daily average. I was a bit scary to use the 1x value by the look on the chart, so have multiplied by 2. That is what is printed in Yellow on the chart. I am not familiar with the "combined" average range of 1, 5, 10 and 20 periods; would you mind elaborating a bit? Akira Attached File(s) ATR in Pips.mq4 3 KB | 554 downloads

Hi, RisingSun! Could you tell me how do you enter your trades. Do you enter trades after your indicator riches some level or when you see reversal signal on one of the pairs? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hi bob348, My apologies for not replying earlier. Have totally missed your post somehow. The ocs indi at the bottom of my screenshot draws pink lines and says Trading OK if the distance bar is above or below it. That is the 1st condition, then you will have to decide if it is the highest (lowest), but you will need some screen time to get the feel. You may at times need to make second or even third (very rarely) entries to average your entries (for both pairs, of course). I can email you a zip file containing all components I use if you like. Pls PM me if you want. Market has been inactive for this method to trade often but here is one just closed (very small gains though). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This looks very interesting,is anyone still trading it? Martin

I hope someone can help me. I have played with this strategy for 2 yrs and was about to give up as there will always be an extended period where correlated pairs deviate. What I have found is that there are some predictive qualities using the original indicator ...neutralpriceoscillator_V1....using certain parameters and certain pairs it will give you a short term prediction on the direction of these pairs.....the problem I have encountered is that the indicator wont work on newer versions of MT4......I get the following error when I attach the indicator....startingtime seems to be wrong...when I try to remove the staring time parameter from the code, it won't load at all. If someone can help me I will share the parameters I use to help predict short term direction. thx.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Hi @tacirring, I recompiled the indicators and here you have the latest versions. Please post what and how you trade...

--- 帖子 #778 ---
tacirring, I would greatly appreciate it, if you would share with us your discovery of the short term predictive qualities of the neutralpriceoscillator_V1 using certain parameters and certain pairs. It would be great to have help in knowing the short term direction. Bruce

HI swingman: ＹＯＵＲ Ｉndicator is very good! thank you!

Hi Rising sun, are you still using this system?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi, I am searching all over for an EA to close profit or stop loss for this strategy, but some are to complicated or cannot choose pairs to trade. Any one here could share an EA which only control selected pairs, and close both when total TP or total SL hit. It would be great because we could open trades on many pairs and wont have to sit in front of the computer. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Dear SwinMan , This is a very, very impressive strategy. I just started test it manually. I noticed it's been a while since your last post, I would like to know if there's any update for all the indicators? I hope you can see this post. Thank you. -wccmcd

--- 帖子 #783 ---
This post seemed to look interesting, but after reading 5 pages I realized it as piece of rubbish "strategy". I'm gonna to refrain you from delluding yourself. That's not hedge. I'm little lazy and I didn't read that's all, so if anybody did it before me, please ignore that post. Of course trading eurjpy and gbpjpy is just simply trading EURGBP, but expressed in yen, and if you not have the same amount of yen in both pairs then broad moves on yen will also be meaningful. That's differ from one-directional eurgbp trade but here is why: in your presented case buy 1 lot eurjpy and sell 1 lot gbpjpy, you actually: buy 100k eur, paying for it in japanese yen (eurjpy : 134.31, you paid 134,31* 100.000 yen) - (basically you change yours 134.310.000 jpy for other's 100.000 eur) buy jpy, paying for it by 100k gbp (gbpjpy : 180.46, you get 180,46*100.000 jpy and give 100k gbp) - (you change yours 100k gbp for someone other's 180.461.000 jpy) so, in summary you have now 100.000 eur and 180.461.000 jpy and you paid 134.310.000 jpy and 100.000 gbp. your exposition is not only on eur and gbp but jpy as well, not as you probably wanted. the second pair: gbpjpy is more exposed on moves on yen. there is not edge in this strategy. basically in current time moves on yen was in your favour, because of poor luck(you didn't even know about it).

hi,@SwingMan The provision of mq4 files of NeutralHedge-Indicators, I want to ask. At the same, the following data (numerical value) of NeutralHedge Overlay_v4.ex4, CSV or, what can not be output in the TXT file. → "HedgeRange =" → "Threshold =" → "Trading:" Best regards

Hello, I just noticed some of you had replied to my post of almost 2 yrs ago. I am so sorry for not responding. Basically I have found that if you observe certain correlated pairs using certain indicators, namely neutralprice osc v1, one or both of the pairs or cfd's will reverse direction when the indicator reaches an extreme pt. I have used sp500/nasdaq very successfully.

Hi swingman, you did a great job helping people here ... Congratulations, the world needs more people like you! Have you made an updated version of the "NeutralHedge Overlay_v4" indicator? Because it has a gap between the pairs, a kind of repaint ... Could you correct that?

@SwingMan thank's for your job! Can I ask you 2 questions ?? 1- about indicator "NeutralHedge Overlay_v4", wich is the mathematical formula for calculating the threshold? 2- regarding EA "smDan Orders EA_v2" the "Buy" and "Sell" buttons do not work Thanks

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Dear SwingMan! Could you please translate the indicator NeutralHedge Overlay_v4.mq4 to MT5 in order to test it in the tester of strategies of MT5 and to observe the correlation during the history?

--- 帖子 #799 ---
NeutralHedge Overlay_v4.mq4 it is much easier and comfortable to have it done to shift last bar in history back and forward , with vertical line .

--- 帖子 #800 ---
the ground issue was to trade the spread against the trend, aiming to close gaps between pairs , - much more safe is to enter on crossing of pairs , - small losses , big gains &amp; no threat to get margin call take a look at the gaps they definitely could smash depo

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Zeusjoes's divergency but a little bit in more exact and delicate way to whom it may concern

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I have searched the thread and the forum. But couldnt find anything.. What are these indicators that you use?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
it is highly unlikely to find something similar to those I was working on bunch of these indies for 4 years / the whole matrix of the forex is sewn in (but exotic)
