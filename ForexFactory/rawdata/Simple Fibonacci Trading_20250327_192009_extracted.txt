***** Latest update here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...88#post5596788 *****

I only started this thread a few weeks ago but already it has evolved into something better. The basic idea is the same, we're going to use fibonacci retracements to enable us to buy/sell into the trend when the momentum is moving back in the direction of the trend. We're also going to use the 38.2% fibonacci extension as a profit target.

When I started the thread I had the idea of using a 100 sma to define the trend and then only take trades in that direction but I found that this is too restrictive and a lot of profitable trades were being missed as a result. Now I am using the zig zag indicator which comes with mt4. I am yet to find a setting that suits all pairs in all timeframes but using 15 as the first setting seems to cover most eventualities. This indicator isn't to be used rigidly, it is merely there to help spot the best swing high/low points to use for drawing fib retracements.

I am using this on all pairs and all timeframes and I prefer to find a strong trend although I am willing to take trades that don't necessarily fit the criteria if I see a trend change in progress or a smooth trendline forming. I have found trendlines to be a good tool to help spot good trades for this method.

The basic system involves first spotting an impulse wave in a trend. If you don't know how to do this then there are charts below or you just need to do some more reading! Then you draw a fibonacci retracement on the chart (again, if you don't know how you need to read more). Once the price retraces to the 50% fib retracement level then you place a pending order the other side of the 38.2% level. In an uptrend you would put a buy order 1 pip plus the spread above the 38.2% level. In a downtrend do the opposite. The first profit target is the last swing high/low point plus or minus 1 pip and the spread depending on the direction. I take profit on half the position at that point. The profit target for the remaining trade is 1 pip plus spread above/below the 38.2% fib extension. The stop loss goes 1 pip plus spread the other side of the 61.8% retracement level.

If all that sounds too complicated then we have a tool to help. FerruFX who is an awesome coder has kindly put together an EA which does all the work for you. Just place the fibs on the chart and rename it BUY or SELL depending on which direction you want it to trade. If the retracement pulls back to the 50% level then it will automatically place the pending order, stop loss and take profit. If the price then continues beyond the 75% level it will remove all orders as the setup is invalidated. If the trade is entered the ea takes half profit at the first target level and trails the stop on the second half of the trade. Most of these figures are adjustable in the ea so if you want to take 66% profit at the first level you can or if you want to invalidate the trade at 61.8% instead of 75% you can. I have attached the latest version below but it may well be updated as we go along so check the latest version.

There are some screenshots attached below as well which illustrate what I am looking for when I take a trade. The first one is eurusd...

Point A is the low point of the current trend. Point B is the first swing high. Point C is the first retracement point, a higher low. Point D is the next swing high point. By point D you can see a possible channel forming and you can have the channel lines drawn. At point E I've already got my fibs drawn and the trade is validated by the price touching and just breaching the 50% fib level. It is extra confirmation that the touch of the 50% fib level happens more or less in conjunction with the rising lower trendline. At point F the trade is entered by the pending order as the price moves through. Now waiting for the first profit target to be met at point G.

The second chart is the same eurusd chart zoomed out a little. Point H is the ultimate profit target. Notice how it corresponds with the major resistance level just before 1.35. You can see by zooming out the chart that the trade has room to move, there are no major support and resistance levels in the way to stop it and it is a large enough trade to give good risk/reward.

The third chart is audusd, again another nice channel but this time to the downside. I had a short trade on the last swing down which reached the first take profit level but then reversed. I took profit on the second trade because I had bought eurusd and didn't want to be long one and short the other. Looks as though we could be setting up for another short.

To sum up, these trades happen all the time on all timeframes where the price pushes in one direction and then retraces before carrying on in the main direction. The advantage to using fibonacci in this way is that you are only taking the trade once the price has reached at least 50% retracement and then started to move back in the direction of the trend. It is an almost completely mechanical system once you have identified the swing, the only hard part about it is determining the best swings to watch for a retrace. I will be posting my trades before they setup as we go along so if you're unsure about any of the above read the rest of the thread and you should find the answer. If you still need help then just ask.

Here's gbpusd just set up.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Euraud and gbpusd setups just blasted through the top so no valid trades there. As soon as something sets up properly I will post it.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Here's gbpaud 5 min, I'll update if it sets up.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Gbpaud touched 50% so valid to trade.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
And straight out the other side invalidating it! Waiting for the next one.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Dear Hugh

I found your system very simple and effective, but something doesnt work out, so I guessed probably I miss something...

first, your risk/reward ratio for the first order, as I figured stands on 0.618 instead of 2-3.

the second order also stands on 1.

My second problem is that unless you swapped the entry SL and TP levels for one of the 2 orders you described, I looks as if you are taking two possitions on the same direction only you get out of one of them earlier.... where is the hedging?

I like this attitude but I guess I am missing something here...

Please specify a bit more

Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi, nobody mentioned hedging! Yes, you are taking two orders in the same direction, one of which you take profit at the first fib level and the other you allow to run. It is the same as taking 1 trade and closing half.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Dear Hugh,

I have one problem, an this is that although I fully understand the concept ot this trades, I always have found fib drawing very subjective. There are no fast rules to it. Fo rxample, if we take todys action on GA as in one of your picrtures, we ca see thet in fib atampte A price didi not move to 50 % so it is negated setup. Now, do we simply extend the fibs as in picture B or do we redrawe them as in picture C. Also you can see that thetre have been some intermediat levels even on picture C where you could als drawe the fibs and I marked them with lines.

Please be so kind to give direction or sugestions.

I read an article on fibs, DailyFX I think, and the writer said that the proper use (his opinion?) of fibs is to see where the % lines join with S&R levels - double confirmation.  A 50% level is just a line but if it confirms a previous S/R level it is powerful.  Just someone's idea, not mine and I have never used fibs much, prefer pivots.

Good to see you posting another trading idea.  p

--- 帖子 #11 ---
hello

N/J seems good : uptrend and has touch the 50% retracement and now on the way up to 38,6%

Pascal

--- 帖子 #12 ---
You have a valid point there and I did say that the swing points are open to interpretation. As you say there are no hard and fast rules. The best I can suggest is that if you see a smooth move and a smooth pullback then it's a tradeable move. If the move only pulls back a little and then takes off in the direction of the trend then you have to decide whether to extend the fib to take in the whole move or use the new move to look for a trade. To be honest I don't worry myself too much about the details, when something sets up it sets up, if it sets up and then invalidates itself then it's no big deal.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Confluence of s/r? Yes, works well. This is just something I have noticed works well so I started trading it and made money so thought I'd pass it on. It takes a bit of patience but it's worth the wait.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Not my thread but i will reply since i have been trading fibs for many years.

Generaly, if you find it dificult identifying the swings go back in the start of the sequence and follow the retracements/extensions.

As for this system, i could never find trading fibs this simple, but if it works for you, as it must be if you are suggesting it works, then good luck.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi, sorry I didn't see your post, it was added later as it needed to be moderated.

What timeframe were you looking at and how did it work out?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks for posting, that's good advice. The system works a charm when the price is trending but then what trend following system doesn't?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Euraud this morning, 5 min chart.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Gbpnzd 4 hour. Gbpaud similar setup.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Eurusd 15 min but the retrace looks a bit lazy.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Euraud trade validated.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
bump

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Gone too far the other way so no setup. One will happen soon.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I'm not seeing what you're seeing there. It's not particularly trending and there's no obvious impulse wave?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
it's 4H time frame

sorry I can't send graphics

the orders have start this night at 68,5

I'm looking the trade, now it's positive

thank you Hugh

Pascal

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Great and simple setup here

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thanks. It surely can't get much more simple than this? Just got to wait for a clear setup.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Just check how EU in the 3244~20 area will react for a run up towards 3366.

I draw my fibs a bit different.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Possible EU M15?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Oh, Good Mornin' by the way.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
you certainly do! If it works for you, no problem.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Good morning! Yes, eu set up while I was somewhere else  . I did post it earlier, just missed the entry. Keep an eye on that one, the first target would have been 1.32796 to get to a break even on the second trade. Let's see what happens. Second target is 1.33055.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yeah, I'm in. Actually I was interested to have a look here as I already use a similar method. I draw in on the swings and pay attention to the 50%, 38% and 23%. I won't get in too heavily as it is another method. But I look for touches of the 21 ema or 55 ema and then target 161% or 138%.

AU shown here. The 38% lined up with the 1.0500 and bounced so I am in.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Nice one, glad you caught it.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
1.3250 was an obvious level to watch for a bounce anyway though surely?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
First target hit and second trade to break even.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Sorry. I ended up discussing the AUD/USD trade. I'm in on the EU too, but as the method is different I didn't want to get it all jumbled up on here. I am interested though as I have been pondering orders and trails so I will get my mind into the premise and try it out.

Something to protect pips I think.

Cheers.

James.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Makes sense to me, thanks for posting those.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
It's a probability thing. If the price retraces to the 50% fib and then trades back above the 38.2% level then you have a good probability of it reaching the swing high point. The risk with these trades is that you are risking two trades with high probability on the first one. The move to the 38.2 extension level is slightly lower probability so when you take a loss you take a loss on two trades but the high probability is only to the swing high. I've been testing it for a while and I see it as profitable because of the strike rate for the first trade and when you do hit the second trade target the risk reward can be very high.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
no probs, time to remove them all from your thread..

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Why? You could have left them there?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Oh, didn't want to mess your thread with my stuff...never mind, maybe another time.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
No worries, more posts the merrier. I'm guessing a lot of people need help drawing fibs!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
CASE STUDY. My earlier AU trade would have succeeded with the profit taking method here and EU would have had 1st target hit and the 2nd at BE.

I didn't let my AU and EU run to stops, but closed early for a cumulative BE -2.

I think that as it is only a slight modification to my method I shall incorporate it. I will report, but I am trying not to post too much as I usually end up saying something really stupid.

Thanks to you, Hugh.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Great idea Hugh, I'm loving the simplicity! It also seems like a fairly safe way of trading to me, assuming that the market is trending of course

I might look for some set-ups with this integrated into my system this week and see if I can post any here.

Cheers and good luck!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Ok, beyond the 61.8% we cancel the pending ... What if the price doesn't retrace to 50% ? How long do you allow the price to reach the 50% in order to set the pending ?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hello Hugh,

I gave up on fibs after many fruitless hours trying to decipher the cryptic Skunny thread. Although Bobokus and Simone Guy threads were more straightforward, was not very successful in adapting to real trades.

Congratulations on the simple clear and concise instructions.

I suppose the time spent on the earlier threads was well spent as it is now easier to understand.

Look forward to giving it a test run.

Thanks for revealing the simplicity of fibs,

EP

Got to find a way to protect what you've made!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I think buying at random in an uptrend would make you money most of the time so we've only got to identify the trends. This is just another method of getting into a trend. I like using it because you have defined entries and exits. Please post whatever you find, looking forward to it.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Good question and one I don't have a clear answer to. A good pullback will move fairly smoothly, if you get too much chopping about then think about leaving the trade alone, there will be plenty of others.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
No worries, it's nothing if not simple although some of it is open to interpretation I don't believe that interpretation will be difficult to learn. I wish I had more time to be watching for entries, I've been a bit busy the last few days. If anyone finds an entry please post it!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
If this is something that you are interested in, attached is a small EA I've just coded to manage this Fibo setup.

1/ Set and apply the EA on the chart you want to trade

2/ Apply the Fibo where you want it to be managed

3/ When the fibo is at the right place, then and only then, name it BUY (for a Long setup) or SELL (for a short setup)

Once all in place, the EA will :

1/ Open the pending when price retrace to the 50 level

2/ Place the TP at the 382 level extension (less spread and 1 pip)

3/ Place the SL at the 618 level (plus spread and 1 pip)

4/ Partial close your position (X percent) at the 0 level (less spread and 1 pip)

5/ Move SL to BE when partial close is done

6/ Start trailing when Partial close is done

7/ If price move through 618 level, pending is canceled and Fibo removed

8/ When the position is definitively closed (TP/SL), the Fibo is removed

Then you will have to reapply the Fibo when the next setup is coming.

Hope that will help ...

PS: it was done very quickly (I am super busy!) so please forgive me if there's something wrong. Let me know and I will try to look at it when I will have some time.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Any chance of having a look at the code behind it .

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Sorry ... No

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks for sharing this idea it seems to work

Still going and not out yet

--- 帖子 #55 ---
How do you just knock up something so complicated?! Really nice, thanks very much for that, I will try it out asap.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Its ok thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
All you've done is sell at the 50% fib level, that's not in the rules, I suggest you read them again.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You're welcome. You deserve it.

Not complicated for me ... This is my job !!!

What is the most complicated is to come up with a great strategy ...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Thanks I will :-)

Hello Hugh,

Thanks for sharing your system. Very Simple and looks effective.

There was a UJ set up in 5m, but I missed it.

Thanks,

Arun

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Don't worry, I miss loads of decent setups! Thanks for posting that one. I'll catch one soon.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
But,

1) PA fighting Daily pivot.

2) 100 SMA rule not satisfied.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yep, not a clear set up, a good one to avoid.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Fortunately my TP his for +34pips = 17*2

Next time I ll control myself to avoid such entries...

Closed both trades, not waiting till 38.2 extention since its not valid entry.

Arun

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hugh,

How do you define a valid setup ? The SMA100 you are looking at is used at the time you apply the Fibo or at the time the price retraced to 50% ?

Most of the times the SMA is "flatening" when the price retraced to 50%.

It would be great if you could show on charts both valid and not valid setups and mark at what time the setup/signal became not valid.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Usually the push away from a sloping 100 sma will pull the sma higher with it. The 50% retrace will drop back towards the 100 sma. In general you want the 100 sma to not be breached by the pullback, it should bounce before it gets there. It depends on the original slope of the sma. Here are some charts of valid set ups. The slope of the sma only needs to be gentle to start with as long as price is pushing away from the ma then you have a valid trade.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for this. But could you please show me an example of non valid setup.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
That's a bit trickier to do! A non valid setup is anything that doesn't look like the above... I know that probably doesn't help much but it's the best I can come up with. I know what to look for but it's hard to tell you what I'm not looking for if you know what I mean.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Hugh,

I've been looking at Fibo trading for a month or so now and was intrigued by the simplicity and mechanical aspect of your system.

To help with identifying points to apply the Fibos I use swing high and swing low identifiers. What I am looking for is a significant distance between the two to eradicate the noise inbetween. Also I use daily Pivot points to help with support and resistance confluences.

I will be trying your methodology over the next couple of weeks and will let you know how I get on.

Short at 85.68

--- 帖子 #73 ---
The price on your pic didn't retraced to 50% ... or am I wrong ?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hello Ferru,

Step 4 - Wait for the price to touch the 50% retracement level. It can  breach the level completely or just touch it gently but it must at least  touch.

Which means I m wrong.

I ll take care next time.

Thanks.

Hi Hugh,

Is this a valid entry?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Looks ok. Could be a cleaner pullback.

EU H4 trade taken with the help of the fibonaci trade manager. So far so good it is a waiting game from now on. The trade was planed yesterday and nicely executed this morning while I was at work.

Good stuff

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Hugh...as i see you are just trying to improve or re-alive Bobokus Fibonacci usage..I have used that method for a very long time with really profitable results.But i think u shud share Bobokus' ebook with the thread followers to make them understand the mentality better...It is one of the money-making methods on the forex market...but it has weak sides too !!

- Bobokus accepted %50 as a decision zone where bulls and bears will fight...and we will be following the winner in the basic mentality . But İt does not give max profit in every pair and every timeframe...especially JPY pairs do not respect %50..they mostly retrace back to %78...

As i remember Bobokus just used this method in GBPUSD H1 timeframe , and GBPUSD is really one of the pairs which mostly respects the fibo ratios...So we shud accept that there are some details about this method and it performs good on specific pairs and timeframes...

I used this method with martingale...I mean It made me feel secure enoughh to try even martingale...and the result was good , but i had to use many filters in order to filter wrong signals...You know It can be ur end if the price whipshaws on the center of FİBO when u are aplying martingale....And the best filter was to expect a pinbar or an enfulging bar at the denger zone 38-50-61...it really made the method stronger on different pairs and timeframes...

I will not talk much...and HUGH i really appriciate you that you use this  method which is one of the most effective weapons in forex market.And I think it will be easier for the beginnings if u upload BOBOKUS' ebook in ur first post...it is simple enough to make anyone understand..By this way you will not be asked many questions

But plz try filtering the signals with pinbar or enfulging bars (on lower timeframes like M5)...you will be amazed with the results...

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks Hugh,  the title says it all: simple...not always accurate or perfect!!!  Seems predominantly safe(oxymoron with forex)) and congruent with all other systems.  Will definitively try. Never opposed to new ideas, information or knowledge.  Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Nice thread Hugh.  I use a fib indicator & an S/R indicator as well.  I usually trade on the M1 or M5, scalping as the market moves towards Fibs, S/R or Psych levels.  Here is a picture of the GBP.  Looks like the 38.2 is holding its own.  Its also a pivot level on my chart.

Hi K_Minos,

But you violated 100sma rule. 100sma is in a downtread and you are trading opposite.

So be careful.

Thanks,

Arun

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi, thanks for bringing this to my attention. I have never heard of the bloke but if he's already done something similar to my idea and it's already been discussed and developed then it makes sense for me to take a look and see if there are aspects of that previous work that will inform this discussion. I'll search for the thread and have a read.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Glad you like it, thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Interesting chart. Thanks for posting the indies too.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I agree, that's definitely buying into a downtrend.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hey guys,

This is the h4 chart and I'm using 35sma, enought fo defing a trend.

Anyway this is a demo so no worries, I did draw the fib after the price has checked the 23 line.

Cheers

NB: its a JPY pair

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Yep, nice trade there, well spotted.

Perfect setup with a nice pattern at 50%

Hello there Hugh. I have been learning Fibonacci for several months. Own success has been minimum. Your thread brings me a new hope. Thank you for its creation.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I have not been a big fan of fibos but Hugh has explained and shown us how to use them.  I start demoing this Mon. a.m.  I only trade the NY session and I think the gbp/usd will offer the "smoothest" trends, I'll see.  If anyone has a better suggestion please fire away.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
...this appeared to be what the name implies, "Simple".  ...so, decided to give it a try, mini-lot size.

Entered Long at 20:04 GMT (12:04 PST local)

Price:  1.31825

SL:  1.31155

TP:  1.32750

Hit TP at 09:32 GMT (01:32 local)

Pip Gain: 82

A 82-pip gain is a nice way to wake up and start the day.

Will continue with mini's until "very" comfortable with this method and shows positive results.

Thanks Hugh for your efforts!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
No problem, glad you like it. Don't give up just because a few setups don't work out, when it does work you're banking good pips.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Glad to have you on board piprac, you've been a good contributor to the other thread, looking forward to a lot of quality input here.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Nice one. From your post I gather you didn't take half profit at the 0% level?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
...I failed to mention that I only placed one order and I cannot split a "mini"....

Thanks again....

What do you guys think?

traders who trade this system, what si win ratio ?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hugh -

I have looked at 10 pairs on the 4H TF and there were no 50% retracements; there were two on the 1H.  This was after the FRi. close so action was frozen.  I assume there are more opportunities on the lower TFs (which I haven't looked at below 1H yet) meaning of course there may be pullbacks blowing through the 50% level in the wrong direction.  In post #1 I see you prefer5 & 15M TFs so many trades possible but fewer pips.

Your thoughts please and thank you for the thread.  I make stupid entries on your stochastic strategy so maybe having some "lines in the sand" will help me be a better trader.  piprac

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hugh,

I have been following your system and agree that the system has great potential of helping those of us that believe in Fibonacci.

Kindly help me identify how to make my drawn fib levels to show currency prices at the various levels. I could not see where to add the "%$" as you stated in Post #1. I use Metatrader 4.

Thanks again for your sacrifices.

Hi ferrufx great ea but am a slow leaner pls explain again how to use the ea again i mean were to write the buy and sell. once again sorry for trouble you great thread as a whole. if you can use an example at the ea window as attached to the window will help. thank you.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
....

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Please look at attached pic. for more detail.

Draw Fib. levels from "A" to "B" . The "EA" will set a sell stop when the price touches the level 50 with default SL & TP and will delete it if the price touches the 61.8% fib. level.
EA does not need any setting except proper lot size. It will automatically act based on fibo levels.

- Dear Ferrufx, would you please change the "EA" code as be able to set other desired levels for action (like 61.8 or 78.6,....) or consider multiple price action for EA. thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
thanks forexier well explain and good question you ask to be able to set desire levels woyld be lovely and can youpls pm me when modify once again thanks

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Ok will add external inputs to be set as the levels to be traded and for the TP/SL.

Will look at this asap.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Great Job and thanks a lot dear friend.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Looks good to me but you're a little late to the party!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Works fine on any timeframe, you just need to be there to catch them.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks for posting that.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Here's the updated version. Defaults are the original levels in post #1.

Level_retrace = where the price has to go in order to enter the pending
Level_pending = where the pending is placed
Level_TP1 = where the position will partially close
Level_TP2 = final target (the input has to be negative if the levels is extension of the fibo)
Level_SL = where the SL will be placed or pending canceled if not triggered

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank you very much Dear FerruFx for the great and professional EA.

Just 1 question:

Does "Level _ TP1" mean the level where the position will  BE?

Thanks again.

Thank you for the quick development of the EA.

Please, does the EA draw the Fib lines and initiate trades now that you updated it.

I will be glad to see the EA function as per the instructions of Mr. Hugh.

Thanks for the effort

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Outstanding, thanks very much. I can't wait to try it out.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #117 ---
The EA follow the rules in post #1.

You must draw the Fibo as per your own vision of the chart.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
You're welcome!

GJ- long on H4

AU-short on H4

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Very reasonable looking trades.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi. Please tell me if I am doing something wrong, but the EA appears grey in the navigator window, which MT4 help says means it isn't compiled correctly and EA can't be used. I've not used any EA before, so I am a bit dumb in this field.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
The ea is compiled fine. When it's in grey it means that it is an ex4 file which cannot be altered. The code can't be viewed of changed. It's fine to use.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Ahh, I see. Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
To be more precise, when the icon is blue that means that both .mq4 and .ex4 files are in the folder ... and if the icon is grey that means that only the .ex4 is in the folder.

Anyway, the .mq4 file isn't needed to use EAs/indicators in the platform.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
ferrufux thank you very much for the EA and it seems people are not contribute anymore but dont be dis-courage were are still here lovely EA

THANK You

--- 帖子 #126 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Here's gbpusd. The slope of the ma isn't perfect but ok.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
No good, stopped out on that one. Oh well, on to the next.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I took the trade from the 15 min chart - didn't work this time :-(

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hugh - how many pairs do you trade?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I trade all available pairs but my broker has pretty low spreads. Eurnzd is around 5.5 pips, my previous broker was 15!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
In the attachments of this thread, some are .EX4 and some are .MQ4.  Shouldn't they all be .MQ4?  How else do we modify?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
You don't. There's nothing in the code that needs changing and if there is you can just ask the person who originally coded it. (who is an awesome coder by the way)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Possible buy setup on eurusd 30 min but can't post pic at the moment. I'll post one if it sets up.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Is this the set up? waiting for price to reach 50%?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hugh - is this based upon Fibonacci Retracement on 15M chart?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
That's the one, thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Looks better on 30 min.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I've been playing around with the zigzag indicator to see if it helps define the trend a little better and it does look quite good. I think it is better to drop the sma rule and just use the zigzag indicator that comes with metatrader under custom indicators. You can change the first setting to define larger or smaller swings if you want. I set most of them to 15 but needed 30 on eurusd to define the swing I wanted properly. You can change it as and when you want to so it's not exactly curve fitting, you're just changing it to the conditions. I've attached my current charts. I am concentrating on just a few pairs for now until I get the time to set up the rest. You'll notice I've drawn some trendlines on too, handy for defining the trend.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
LOL!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Lol what?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Audusd opened overnight. Currently 12 pips up. Let's see where it gets to. Nothing else triggered yet, usdjpy and euraud invalidated but gbpusd still valid and euraud could be setting up for a much bigger trade if it pulls back smoothly.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi FerruFx thanks for your effort, is it possible to incoporate alert to this EA so that when trade trigger and  first profit reached an alarm sound thanks

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I've got a sell setup on usdjpy 4 hour and audusd short still running. Other possible setups gbpusd long 4 hour. Can't post pics right now but will update later.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hugh,

Chart attached with question.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #146 ---
and GBPUSD - hope you don't mind me posting these Hugh.

GBPUSD not quite touched 50% - are you waiting for the touch or happy with pull back and now awaiting entry?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Here's my take on usdjpy. Of course this could be completely wrong! I'm short on the 4 hour move down but I see it as part of a larger pullback in the daily.

Gbpusd below, I'm using a slightly different swing point.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Will look at this asap.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thank you ferrufx

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi FerruxEx , correct me if I'm wrong I downloaded the EA into the indicators and when I drag it over the charts nothing happens, please let me know the right way to set it and thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
HI HUGH

U-J ... SELL BEFORE ...

W. .. overbought

D. .. Overbought + CANDELA

H4 ... Overbought + CANDELA

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Yep, my usdjpy short pulled back quite a bit but it's going back the right way now.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Gbpusd set up and then promptly invalidated. I've zoomed out for a bigger view and there is another possible setup on the 4 hour.

Audusd is blazing a trail, coming close to the 0% level (first profit target).

--- 帖子 #154 ---
jimbo you have to put it in the expert not indicator

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi FerruFx, I wonder too if you could change the cut off point for the trade (ie the level at which the trade is not valid) to 75% rather than 61.8% or possibly make it customizable? Thanks for your work on this, it is completely awesome.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Here are my current trade setups I'm watching. Still just watching a few pairs. Not sure about the euraud one, could easily go higher before it pulls back.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
THANK YOU, Tiwa.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here's the EA update:

1/ Level to cancel is now settable by user

2/ Alert option (sound/pop up/email) when a pending is placed or TP #1 reached

Hope that will help ...

--- 帖子 #159 ---
FERRUFX you are genius thank you very much

--- 帖子 #160 ---
That is completely awesome, thanks very much!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Can someone tell me why this didn't take a trade thanks.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
1/ What is the exact name of the Fibo on your chart ? (Fibo properties > Common > Name)

2/ When did you applied the EA on your chart ?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Its the fibs in MT4 and the EA went on after the fib was placed.

Its says fib 34611

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Do you keep same settings for the ZZ on all timeframes you are looking ?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Please refer to the instructions given in the post where the first EA version was uploaded.

You can't get any trade according to what you did.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
K will go back through and look again.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Thanks again got it to work.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hugh,

How will you handle this situation on EU ?

M30 short setup

H1 long setup

(ZZ 24.12.6)

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Yes but I'm playing around with settings at the moment. I don't think it will always show you what you want at the same setting, sometimes the swing you are looking at will be larger or smaller and there are always swings within swings. Generally though if you are looking at a timeframe and you can see a bigger swing that looks more promising then just go up a timeframe. I've noticed I've tended towards 4 hour charts now as that seems to be the better, more tradeable swings.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I'm short eurusd on a 30 min setup but waiting for a long on the 4 hour chart. I've opened two charts and changed the magic number of the second ea to achieve this. Took me a while to work out I had to do this!

A similar thing is happening on usdjpy where I am short on the 4 hour chart but looking to take a daily long trade.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
In terms of the hourly long, I'm not sure how you can really decide which direction to trade other than look at each timeframe and take a decision which looks better. I know I want to be long if it retraces a bit more on the 4 hour chart but I also think it is going to retrace and so I'm trading it down on the 30 min chart. I think there is definitely room for improvement in the rules but the best thing I can say at the moment is that the risk reward makes it viable to take these trades.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Just as an advice it is more important to stick to a timeframe where you see the setup better rather than flipping around which would cause confusion, to my experience you will trade wrong direction

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I agree to an extent but I think it depends on your overall view of the trend. I think eurusd will pull back so I am short but I also think in the overall trend I want to be long from a certain level. I could be wrong and am prepared to be so.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
My 30 min eurusd short got taken out for a loss. I still think the 4 hour could retrace before a move higher so I'll keep that in place.

On the other trades I've got audusd still open and floating around 80 pips up. It very nearly reached it's first profit target overnight but missed by a few pips and went back up. I'll hold that open and see if it reaches tp1 during the day today. Usdjpy is pushing down nicely now after a slow start. Nothing else is setting up imminently but I'll keep an eye out and post if I like anything.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
That makes sense.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hugh/FerruFX

I'm looking into seeing if there is any benefit in filtering the trade by determining if 2 time frames are going in the same direction. So as long as the 4hr and 1hr are in the same direction or the 1hr and the 30min but not the 4 hr I can take the trade on whichever looks best. If the directions are different then I can stand aside.

Just theory at this point!!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I've been looking for an EA like this for a while, however I'm unable to find it to download in this thread, has it been removed?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I have aboute 2 years since I started to inquire about Forex. At the moment I am very attached to it, I can afford a day that to see what is happening in the market...  , in this 2 years I made some Forex Strategy with Fibbo atachement  that I use at the moment, and, because I do not have time to write this strategy here you can see it on my blog just click

If you have some questions not hesitate to write, I will gladly answer.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
As Hugh said earlier, we can have swings inside swing ... so opportunities in opposite direction.

Example in a Long trend D1, you may have smaller H1 Short trends.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Posts #51, #112 and #158

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Cheers, is there a manual to read on how to use this?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Did you read the post #51 ???

--- 帖子 #184 ---
if you are able to coordinate 3 tf (or minimum 2 tf) .... the posibidades of success are very high.

I get a lot of private messages and I have no time to answer.

and as this strategy is the most similar to mine it will put the two examples here.

1.-EXAMPLE

E-J ---- D1

Mn ............ oversold

W1 .......... Oversold + candle

D1 ........... oversold + candle

--- 帖子 #185 ---
2.- EXAMPLE... NOW SELL IN H4

W1 ... Overbought

D1 .... Overbought + Candle (ENGULLYNF)

H4..... Overbought + Candle (INSIDE)

If you want you can draw fibo in d1 ... what matters is that the candle on h4 form below the candle of d1

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Ironic isn't it - you get taken out and then the trade works and reaches target 1.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi all!

I start using this system 2 days ago. It's very interesting, simple, and I think profitable system! Thx. to author.

I have one question: On time frame M30 H1 and H4 what setings you use in indicator ZigZag?

....and which indicator you use for determine the trend?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thanks for posting these, that approach makes a lot of sense.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes, it's not going to work all the time.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I'm using different settings at the moment according to whatevere looks best. I'm sure we can improve on the best settings but I think just use the setting that picks out the most obvious swing points. Try 15.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Audusd reached tp1 so the ea closed half and now trailing the second half although it has pulled back a little. Usdjpy is well on it's way to tp1 as well. Eurusd may soon hit the 50% retrace level on the 4 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
thank you, Hugh, for letting me post here ... my English is very bad

but now I can answer private messages referring members to this page

--- 帖子 #193 ---
i have used a method like this for a few years and i confirm that is simple and effective!

cheers

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hugh

EURUSD - would you consider the 60min as as a set up instead of the 4H if 4H does not touch 50%?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
OR - has the 60min violated entry by dropping below 100sma?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
You are always welcome to post on any of my threads, your input is always very appreciated and valuable.

Creo que tu eres uno de los hombres buenos aqui.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thanks for taking the time to post. It's good to know we are on the right lines.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Read back a few posts and you will see I am not using the 100 sma any more. I am busy formulating an idea for how to spot a valid setup against a nonvalid one and I'm getting close. Once I have it sorted out I will post.

The above trade could work but I'm still holding out for the 4 hour one.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Looking at a potential set up on USDJPY 1H - your take on this guys??

Any comments?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Must have missed that one :-)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I'm short usdjpy already but yes, it could work.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
No worries, I'll update the first post over the weekend with more a more coherent trading plan.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Eurusd 4 hour has set up.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
FerruFx, looking at the audusd trade I think it actually closed half dead on the 0% level. I think it is safer to do this 1 pip + spread above that level. Which way is the ea coded, is it my imagination?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
As per your rules in post #1, BUY TP1 is below level 0 less spread less 1 pip

"Let's assume for this example we are in an uptrend. The first order goes  1 pip + spread above the 38.2 level. The stop loss is 1 pip + spread  below the 61.8 level and the take profit goes 1 pip + spread below the 0  level"

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I think that is for long trade as Hugh talks about swing high

--- 帖子 #207 ---
AudUsd was short?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
As Raggs has pointed out above that is for a buy trade, the audusd trade was a short so the level should be above the 0% level by 1 pip plus the spread BUT you have already coded a solution into the ea by putting the tp level at 1 or 2% instead of 0 so the ea will take half profit just before the price reaches the 0% level in either direction. Ingenious

--- 帖子 #209 ---
This is exactly how it is coded in the EA.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Ok, I must have been mistaken about the point it took profit. Thanks again for an excellent tool.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Some times you may have slippage and requote involved ...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yes. I don't think the market was moving very fast. Works a treat anyway, such a relaxing way to trade!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Not sure about the rules they have changed a little but tried GU went well.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
You are right, the rules need redefining a bit. Generally you want to trade with the trend/momentum and gbpusd has a bit of upwards momentum at the moment so not a bad trade to take. I'm tending to use the higher timeframes. My eurusd long on the 4 hour has triggered.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I have a sell fib pulled but it wont trigger till 1.3315ish. I drew it off H1

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Dear Hugh Briss please read the following article that may help redefine the rules for more successive positions.(It is based on support & resistance levels located on 3 important fibo levels 0.386,0.5,0.618)
http://www.dukascopy.com/fxcomm/fx-a...gy-Part&id=629

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Can one of the coders in here tell me how to make the dotted line change colors. I can put the code in just don't know how to find it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Nice but in this example just before your example you would have 2 losses !

--- 帖子 #219 ---
nu to north??

--- 帖子 #220 ---
gu.. miss out to check in the plane....

--- 帖子 #221 ---
ferrufx you did a great job but dont think we ask too much please is it possible you coded the EA so that the stop loss and the profit level can be drag this is the trade i took last nite thou i use 61.8 level because eurusd respect 61.8 level more than 50% just with my experience Attached Image (click to enlarge)

.thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
EU buy

CHF sell

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Sorry wrong chart

edit: closed both

--- 帖子 #224 ---
You can set the levels as you need in the inputs.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Not sure if I did something wrong today on my GU trade I had the EA tp at the 0 line instead of taking part off and leaving the rest. I don't know if I was suppose to put in inputs but the EA is great the last 2 trades whr taken with me not home so this is perfect as I can set things before I leave for work vey nice Ferru

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Do you mean that the entire position was closed at level 0 ?

What are all your EA settings for that chart ?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yes entire position

Exactly like V3 was posted didn't change anything

--- 帖子 #228 ---
That makes no sense. Did you noticed only once ?

What is your MT4 build ? (Help > About)

Do you have error messages in experts and journal tabs at the time of the close ?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Build 418 and no errors. It has done it 2 times but 1 was V2.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Please (and this is valid for everybody), revert back to build 409. The new MT4 build is full of bugs and yet not fixed by Metaquotes.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
K not sure how to do that but will try.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Setting up UCAD

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Just Google "MT4 build 418" and you will find many solutions.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
No problem my live acc is still 409 just testing it right now but I really like it so far very nice work.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thanks for posting that, I will take a look.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
1) I can see the chart you mean but I can't see any losing trades. The price would have pulled back too far and invalidated the trade. It would be good if you could go back through the chart and draw the fib levels that would have triggered the losing trades?

2) Losses happen, no way to avoid it and sometimes yes, even two in a row! Get over it.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Good to see you over here Mr L!

I can see what you mean on nzdusd but it's a little bit trendless at the moment. I'm long eurusd and waiting to short audusd again if it moves higher. Not sure about nzdusd, hard to call.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes, I missed a gu long because I was looking at the bigger swing.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Why buy eur and sell usdchf at the same time? They are so strongly correlated you are just doubling your risk, may as well just trade one.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Did you use a round number for the lot size? It has to be able to close half.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I'm using the ea with build 418 and it is working fine but I will look into going back to 409?!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I don't like usdcad at the moment as it is a little bit choppy and not trending very smoothly at all but the setup looks ok, it might work.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Eurusd working out nicely, I'm thinking trendlines may well play a part in the revised rules. I took the rest of the profit on audusd when the long triggered on eurusd as I didn't want to be long one and short the other and I'm waiting for audusd to pullback some more before I sell it again. Hopefully eurusd will at least hit tp1 before the usd tide turns.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
for au im expecting it will test upper TL...

reason... daily hav pin bar n H8 stoch just cross at oversold area...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
H8?? You and your weird timeframes! I agree that xxxusd is going up in general at the moment so if eurusd goes up as far as the 38.2 extension level then by then audusd could be ready to fall in tandem with it from the upper trendline. This will provide a valid short setup on audusd. Nice.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hugh

AUDUSD - 4H

Do you look at setting a trigger order for when the price reaches 50% retracement?

e.g. If price >= 1.0431 then activate the orders - this obviously means you can walk away and leave it to do its own thing. Do you leave initial entry order as DAY or GTC?

By the way I don't use MT4 so if the 'ea' you guys keep talking about takes care of this then fine - but I use TS platform.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Correlated but inversly and I felt good about where the fibs where.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Yes .1 just as the EA was setup.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi all

I want to take the survey!

I use this system on H1 sometimes look to H4.

What timeframe are useing YOU???

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Instructions are in the first post.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Your broker allows micro lots? 0.1 is 1 mini lot and if your broker doesn't allow micro lots it can't half it.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I'm not restricting myself to any particular timeframe but it appears the 4 hour charts are nicest at the moment.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
hi friend

You can use it at any time ... works at all.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hugh - I understand the first post OK. What I couldn't see is if you place an activation trigger BEFORE the price retraces to 50% (in other words do you do this allowing you to leave the screen for a few hours).

Obviously if in front of screen can see when price hits 50% and then place the pending orders anyway.

Does that make sense? Apologies if I'm not explaining myself well

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I agree - i've tried down to 15min and seems that there are lots of set ups but the volatility at this level is perhaps a little high for this strategy.

Keep up the good work Hugh - this is really going somewhere (I think).

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I think I get you. I wait for the price to retrace past the 50% level and THEN place the orders above/below the 38.2 level. I cancel the orders if the retrace just carries on past the 75% level. The expert advisor does all this for you, put it on the chart and it will wait until the 50% level is touched and then manage the trade exactly for you, all you have to do is draw the fibs. Too bad you don't use mt4.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I'd love too, but I use TS platform not MT4 so ea's no good to me. I can set up manual trigger orders in TradeStation when price action takes out the 50% level and that starts the ball rolling so to speak.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hugh,

You're right about the 75% level for the pending cancelation. Looks great ... at least on H4.

Do you keep the SL to the 61.8% level ?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
So you can set something up so you don't have to keep watching the chart? That's good.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Yes, I think beyond 75% and the retrace is too large but before 75% seems ok. I do still keep the stop loss at 61.8% because if the trade has started going back with the trend and then reverses then I want to be out fairly quickly.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Ok thanks.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Here are my current trades/setups at the moment. I have added on to the eurusd 4 hour trade with a 30 min setup. The first usdjpy hit tp1 but has then retraced back and stopped out but a nice trendline forming so another short setup there. The rest are just pending waiting for a setup.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Another one here, nzdusd.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
EU and UCAD both active at the moment.

I figured being friday end of month it would either move well or just consolidate and when I got home I see it didn't move much so will see how it goes next week.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Yes, I'm with you on the eur trade. Not sure about the usdcad trade as it doesn't seem to be trading very smoothly at the moment.

I'm going to sit down at some stage today and try and figure out how I can explain what we are looking for when we are taking these entries. The 100 sma idea was ok but it does leave you out of a lot of entries. I think the audusd and eurusd channel setups at the moment sum up everything I like to look for. The eurusd trade on the 4 hour I've just taken was a classic, a nice rising trendline that corresponded to the 50% fib and it bounced off it a treat. Whether the trade works out ultimately or not is less important than the fact that it was a perfect setup. It did almost reach tp1 during Fridays trading but couldn't quite reach it before it dropped back but I feel confident for Mondays trading to push it higher and take profit at the first level. It then becomes a break even trade. Even if this does just drop back now and stop out for a loss that is still the type of trade I would want to take all day every day.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
If you figure out what you are looking for, it would be great to update the post #1 with your ideas.

Also I would suggest to upload the last version of the EA in this post #1.

Thanks for all your hard work.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Yes will update post 1 with the recent trade examples and put the ea on the first post. Thanks for YOUR hard work on the excellent ea.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Great!

This thread deserve it ...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
First post updated.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Hugh

I like your simple take on trading the trend. Don't quite get the rationale behind the nzdusd trend, seems sideways for the month. That aside keep 'em coming.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Great!

But you should have updated instead of rewrote the post #1 ... Now most of the following posts will make no sense (for the new readers) based on the updated setup!!!

No problem on my side

--- 帖子 #272 ---
hi hugh...

my view on eu...

i could be wrong...

regards..

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi, yes the nzdusd is more of a range trade but I like the look of the audusd downwards channel and my thinking is that nzd could well reach the bottom of that range on the back of the Australasian weakness.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hmm, I see what you mean but if the first post gets most of the info across well enough then people will soon get up to speed by reading the rest of the thread.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Yes, if it breaks that resistance to the upside then I think we will see 1.35, if not then the daily downtrend will resume. There is so much conflicting information at the moment it is hard to tell. I only need it to reach the first tp level and then I'm break even so won't mind what happens. We should know by tomorrow evening.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
That's fine, I fully understand your point.

Hello, thanks for sharing your system. I'd like to know if I'm understanding the entry requirements correctly. Based on the chart of AUD/USD, I've a sell stop order lined up below the 38.2 value and my stop is set above the 61.8 Fib value. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
You are right about the rules but mind the gap. Such a large gap can produce some odd behaviour.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thank you for the response.

EU finished with profit. UCAD still going.

My eurusd 4 hour trade didn't quite reach tp1 yet and pulling back now but should make it eventually. I had a few smaller eurusd trades on the 30 min chart and took some nice small profits at tp1 but they stopped out the second half at not much more than breakeven. I have no other trades at the moment, most were invalidated because of the gaps. Gbpusd may pullback for a buy setup. See what the week brings.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Another eurusd buy opportunity on 1 hour.

Hugh - EURUSD now invalidated?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Short AUSUSD but a little worried about the gap up.

Gap has now almost filled. If reverses would u get out early?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Yes, invalidated.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Yep, be careful for today, there will be more clearer setups through the week.

Hello Hugh Briss

I seldom use Fibo but I do like your simple Fibo trading system.

Is there a particular Fibo number you pay more attention to?

Maybe 50?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Can you discuss your stoploss in a bit more detail? If I understand correctly, in an uptrend you wait for a 50% retracement, then set a buy stop order at the 38.2% fib level, so the price must start going up again with the trend and thru the 38.2% level to trigger the buy order. I think your stoploss is set below the 61.8% level, so the distance from your entry to your stoploss is from around the 38.2 level to around the 61.8 level. This seems like a pretty big stop to me. I had always heard that one of the advantages of Fib trading was the ability to use tighter stops. Why are you using such a big stop?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
You must give room to the move. If you look, the SL is pretty fine according to the timeframe you are trading. Of course the SL is bigger on the higher TFs but the profit is also bigger ...

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Ferru, can you please incorporate money management into the EA? I mean that we can set percent risk into the EA properties and it would calculate proper position size depending on the parameters set in EA and Fibo?

Thanks,

Lost

--- 帖子 #291 ---
So the EA will calculate the Lot size based on the calculated SL and the risk ... right ?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
As Ferru said - the higher the time frame the larger the stop is going to be by the very fact that the swing points used are further apart. This strategy seems (at the moment) to work better on higher time frames 4H / 1H and 30 mins and therefore your RISK has to be calculated according to which time frame you find a set up on. If you want tighter stops then you should be looking at a lower time frame - but even then the trade has to 'breathe'.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
That is correct., also it can close position partially as it is reaching TPs accordingly.

Thanks,

DD

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Will look at this asap.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Yes, if you read the rules I wait for a 50% retrace and then place my trade.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thanks a lot, Ferru. You are the man!!!

Also would it be possible to put some light grey lines to see where those entry, stop, TPs are? Also when the Entry gets executed, the line would become green or something as well as the other lines as they get validated or not? I mean something visual that would give us an idea.

Just a thought. Thanks a lot,

Lost

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Doesn't seem that big to me. I trade a lot of daily charts and a 200 pip stop loss is normal. Even on a 4 hour chart the stop loss on the fib trades is only 70 or so pips.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Agreed, it's risk/reward.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
When the pending is placed, you have all the lines plotted by the platform (entry price, TP #2 and SL). The TP #1 (partial close) is the fibo line you defined in the inputs.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Ok, when is the pending placed then? As soon as price goes past the 50% level ? Because if that's the case, I do not see any pending lines on my chart.

Lost

--- 帖子 #301 ---
If the pending isn't placed when it touch or cross the "Level_retrace", you have certainly something wrong (EA or Fibo line).

Please refer to the EA instructions.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
It is giving me these errors:

FibonacciTrademanager_v3,EURUSD,M15: invalid order price for OrderSend function

FibonacciTrademanager_v3,EURUSD,M15: Error opening SELLSTOP order: 4107

I'm with Oanda on MT4, who uses 5 digit numbers behind decimal point.

It works on FXCM MT4.

Hi there,

"Just place the fibs on the chart and rename it BUY or SELL"

Just a question, when you say Rename the Fibbo on your chart. Where and what are you renaming as I can not figure this out. Are you renaming the EA or the Fibbo Properties it self. I know it may seem simple to some but well, some of us still need to figure this out. I like the systerm as it also manages trades for you when it is invalidated.

Attached are screen shorts of what I need clarification on.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #304 ---
You rename fibo properties exactly where you are pointing in your screen shot. Either with SELL or BUY.

Lost

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Well my UCAD trade that triggered friday stopped out but the good thing it went +21 before it stopped I usually set to BE if trades reach 15-20 if I'm around.

Ferru without keep asking for so much of your time after TP1 can you move stops to +1 so atleast trades that reach the 0 line that are good into profit can close the rest at +1 instead of a loss thanks.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Couple of trades I have pending. EU 15min swing and a CHF H4 swing

--- 帖子 #307 ---
All my codings are fully compatible 4-5digits brokers.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
When price reach TP1, EA close partial lot then move SL of the remaining lot to entry price (BE). This is the current logic.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Here's the updated version with the option to calculate the Lot Size based on SL and risk percent.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
As already answered, yes, you put either BUY or SELL into that box.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
It's my understanding that when the ea closes the first half at the 0% line it should move the stop loss to break even on the second half of the trade AND start trailing the stop as it moves into profit. This is the original system and I believe that is what the ea does.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
It also trails the stop on the second half as well though doesn't it or am I going mad?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Awesome, thanks again, this is getting better and better as we go along. I'll update the first post.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
You're not going mad !

--- 帖子 #319 ---
AU sell

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hugh - as we have been talking it appears the longer time frames work better (so far) with this strategy.

How about looking at a 'scalp' on say 30 or 15 mins where the stop is set at 75% using much smaller swing points.

Obviously this means the R/R ratio will be much lower (which is usual  with scalps anyway) but it should give the trade more 'wiggle' room.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I'm in the audusd sell now and closed the eurusd long for 15 pips. Only had it open since last Thursday! It's been messing about so much. It's actually just closed below the trendline on my 4 hour chart which is not a good sign so closed it. I'm still long euraud though, looks good.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
How is that a scalp? I do enter on smaller timeframes in the direction of the overall trend but just use the same stop loss and profit criteria.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Scalp as in I have taken a smaller swing on the Fibo's (and I should have shown it on the 15min chart).

--- 帖子 #324 ---
But now USDCHF setting up on hourly?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I don't watch usdchf anymore as more or less just mirrors eurusd. I'm looking to short eurusd after the trendline break but that's another system... Usdchf probably going higher with it but it could work, wouldn't want to put you off.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Possible usdjpy 4 hour short forming. Chart to follow if it sets up.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Usdjpy just set up, gbpusd also but both may well invalidate themselves yet. Here's usdjpy.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Well, that was pretty wild! Consider everything invalidated. My only proper fib trade open now is audusd which has hit tp1 and is now trailing. I'm in eurusd short but just from a trendline break, not a system trade by these rules. I closed euraud with profit after everything started going crazy.

I've banked some pips over the last few days despite not many trades reaching their full profit target. I think it pays to use a bit of discretion in terms of when to hold a trade and when to take profit. I don't think this is easy to teach or to learn but just comes with experience. I would like to say that I always follow my own system and leave trades to either work out or not work out but in an ever changing environment like this it's difficult to do so and remain sane. I had eurusd long open from last Thursday and very nearly hit tp1 so many times but just didn't quite and if I'd let it run it would have stopped for a loss. I'm definitely going to keep using the fib method for entries and in normal market conditions (whatever they are!) I would look to let the trades do whatever they do but when extraordinary moves occur like this evening I'm definitely going to step in.

I'll let these two trades run for now and when we get back to quieter conditions I will look for some more trades.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I only took it early cause of time the trade had been on for about 6 hrs in the same spot so decided to protect some.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I put this M15 swing setup after noon time US and got both tp1 and tp2. I love fibs but was never around for the good move thanks to Ferru's EA this is great and thanks Hugh for getting it started.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hugh, EU is setup to go long, on H4.

Agree.....?

C..101

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Nope, if it pulls back smoothly I'm looking to add to a short. Take a look at a daily chart, zoom it out a little and put a fib on the last major move down. Could be wrong.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
EU short triggered

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hugh - having looked at the daily what would be your take on this break of the 38 Fibo. Is it something you would trade or rather drop down to a lower time frame?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I think I will watch the 4 hour chart and trade the trend there (if a trend develops). The daily is higher risk for higher reward but the timeline is a little too large for me. If it pulls back smoothly and makes a lower high then we can draw a trendline for the next possible move down and that will be the first trade (if it breaks the 38.2 again).

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Turboguru,

I observed your Fibo Drawings. I've come to understand that you draw your fibs based on broader perspective. The Pending EU (now trigerred) and GU trades confirm my observation.

Please, did you widen the fib areas of interest now to accommodate the spikes of yesterday (USD Bullish run) or have been using this broader perspective for your previous fibs and trades.

Kindly enlighten me and also help me know your performance rating with the broader Fib drawings in line with the rules of this thread.

I can see a lot sense in your approach as I am confused as to how to approach the fib drawings now after that strong and lengthy candles of yesterday.

Thanks for your understanding.

Possible set up occurring on EURJPY.

Any comments?

Looked at daily and there is potential for small pull back to test Nov 11 support area

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Similar potential set up to EUJP

If set up occurs on both see which one offers best R/R

Again any comments - am I missing anything obvious that would prevent this trade if it did set up?

Thanks, glad you like the thread. Pleased someone actually got the joke!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Not sure I totally understand your question. I look for good swings and start from higher TF's and go down from there. I consider all swings and will keep moving my fibs down/up based on the pull back. If I see a fib that just pulled to the 38 or less I think the rise/drop is not over. I have used fibs alot but never had a EA that I could set trades up on and alot of good swings had already happened. Depending on swings you can take different TF's say from 4hr down to a 5 min chart and can predict alot of the moves to come. Charts get busy with all the fibs but when you put them on yourself its not to hard. I also use fibs with sup/dem it helps with confirmation.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
EU going well AU just closed its at decent demand area. Also CHF trade is on.

CHF is at supply so could be in some heat on this one.

I've taken profit on everything now. Waiting for some clearer setups. xxxusd is possibly pulling back now so could be some good trades at the start of next week.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hugh - USDJPY has hit target 1, now trailing stop

GBPJPY I decided to close early and take some risk ff the table (as USDJPY was working so well).

I was in both trades as they triggered whilst away from desk. I know the risk is higher if both went against me but it was risk I was prepared to take.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Funny isn't it - if I had not seen my charts today my automatic orders would have both been filled on GBPJPY!

Psychologically I wanted to reduce my risk because I was Long JPY on 2 pairs and got nervous.

There was nothing on the charts to indicate I should really change my overall outlook from the initial trade set up. There was room on the daily for this to move. So why did I do it? Same reason as always - my emotions got in the way.

We have to accept this is part of trading and move on. I just thought I would share that the system can work if you trust your rationale for entering the trade,

Thank you 'hubris' for sharing this with us - the orders could have been hit if I had left them :-)

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Never worry about missing out on trades because you reduced your risk. You never know what's going to happen next and if you start to feel uncomfortable with your current level of risk then there is nothing wrong with closing one of the trades you have running early or taking half profits on one of your trades. In a perfect world these trades would either work out straight away or hit the stop loss straight away, at least then you know, but it's not a perfect world and a trade that goes your way at first can easily snap back against you. That's why the core strategy says to wait til tp1 is hit then move half to break even and trail, it's locking in profit as you go along.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Well said.

Hello Hugh,

I must say how much I appreciate what you have done here. I have always found Fibs to be a little too subjective to interpretation, but you have done a very nice job teaching a simple and surprisingly mechanical system. I also appreciate your explanations of how to interpret when a trade is valid or invalid.

I also am impressed with the work of FerruFx. His EA is quality workmanship.

I subscribed to the thread when it was about 5 pages long, but I did not take the time to read it until now. I am glad I did. I have enjoyed learning something new.

Thank you.

William

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Thank you for your kind comments. Very much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Glad you like the thread and I will second your thoughts about FerruFx, the EA makes a huge difference to the system and makes it so easy to trade.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Great !

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I second William's thoughts, at his suggestion I just completely read your thread.  Great stuff I have been using fibs to trade for quite awhile and have learned a lot here.  I absolutely love the EA, its a work of art you are a true genius FerruFx.  Thank you for creating,  I am looking forward to trying it out on Sunday.

Thank you

Robert

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hello FerruFx,

Robert (SurfNomad) is a Fibaholic.  When I saw your EA, I knew he would flip.  He did.  I just got his email.

I have spent a large portion of the day playing around with the settings.  I am truly impressed.  Not only does your EA work great with Hugh's wonderful system, it works with almost anything you can dream up with Fibs.

Simply put, this is one of the most useful tools I have seen developed here at FF.

Thank you for your hard work.

William

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I don't know what to say ...

Thanks !

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Not really trending no but flip to a H4 and its having some nice swings, enough for me to not be nervous over.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Hugh, pardon me for sounding stupid but here are some noob questions:When you draw the fibo retracement lines do you draw them exactly tracing the zigzag indicator? By using zigzag indicator settings to 15 - may I ask if you are referring to the M15 timeline or the ExtDepth variable? Much Thanks! - CK

--- 帖子 #380 ---
The zigzag indicator is just there as a visual guide to help spot swing high/low points. A lot of the time it lines up perfectly with the swing high/low points that you should be trading but sometimes you will be able to see other points that look better. This is usually when the zigzag indicator is picking out lots of smaller swings when a larger move would be a better trade. I suppose it's something you get used to the more you do it.

The 15 refers to the first setting in the indicator which I believe is extdepth.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Thanks for the replies there Hugh; While I technically know how to draw the fibo retracement.. I'm still questioning myself on exactly what is a valid retracement line.. is it generally safer to trace identical to the zig zags?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Not necessarily but I suppose you could do that. The best thing to do is to look at lots and lots of charts. Go back through as much history as your broker has and use the f12 button to advance through one candle at a time. Try and spot when a market is beginning to trend and learn what a good impulse move looks like. Then draw the fib and see what would have happened to your trade. There is no substitute for spending long periods of time studying historic charts if you really want to get good at this. You have to develop a feel for the market you are trading. One thing that can really accelerate your learning is using a trading simulator. There is one on the forum. Put "trading simulator" into the search bar at the top and the first one in the list is the one I use. It's easy to set up and use. I have spent many many hours using that trading simulator with various strategies and I find it a brilliant tool.

Hi - A couple of questions for Hugh and turbo...

I notice that some of the trades that turbo is taking are pushing past the 75% retracement before entry which is against the original rules. Where do you set your, 'gone too far, now it's invalid' point?

Also, where are you both setting your stop losses? I didn't see a reference to that in the first post. Visually, it looks like it's at roughly 66% retracement, or are you setting it in relation to swing high and lows?

Thanks

PB

--- 帖子 #389 ---
The rules should actually be called guidelines. Nothing is to say that a pair that pulled back 76% would not be as good a trade as one that pulled back 74%. If the trade was originally invalidated but then starts moving smoothly in the right direction I would consider taking the trade. I believe that the stop loss is mentioned in the first post but you are roughly right, the stop loss goes 1 pip plus the spread above or below the 61.8% fib retracement level.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks Hugh - makes a lot of sense. By the way, had another look but I can't see the stop positioning on the 1st post (at least for people not using the EA). Thanks for clearing it up.

PB

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The EA is set for 78 so thats whr I left it. 75 or 78 is so close to me it doesn't matter. Its about the swings alot pull backs will make a 78 fib just have to look at bigger TF's. Remember pulling fibs on swings is pretty subjective,have to look at charts and go back as far as possible in history to get a feel,Hugh touched on backtesting nothing is more important than that.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
You are right, I've adjusted the first post so it mentions the stop loss. Thanks for pointing that out.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Look at the channel on audusd 4 hour at the moment, there have been some big pullbacks in that trend, maybe some would have invalidated the trade originally but then gone on to be good trades. At the end of the day you have to feel comfortable with the risk you are taking. If you feel that the trade is worth taking but you have slight doubts about it then use a smaller position size.

--- 帖子 #394 ---

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I don't like the look of either of those. Yes they conform to fibonacci to a degree but it's not as though they are trending or anything. To me you're not trading impulse waves in a trend, you're trading random movements. Maybe this will work for you but I think you're better off looking for trends.

Having said that my gbpaud short stopped out for a loss. The obvious reason why was that it was against the trend! D'oh! Oh well, I'm short audusd now and 20 pips up so I'm back on track. Gbpusd is almost setting up too.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Are you looking for trading opportunities across all time frames or focusing on particular ones? Just wondering whether any are working out the best. Guessing the H1 and H4 will be more reliable?

Thanks,

Hi hugh, pls comment on my entry for this trade..

blueline=entry below 38.2

green=tp1 above 0, above -38.2

red=sl above 61.8

enter only when retracement hit 50%, invalidated when 61.8 is brenched

ps, thanks ferrufx for the ea.. hope you dun mind me asking some question regarding it.. how do i change the settings for the EA, eg. lot size and 75 invalidating point..i seems to have problem modifying it as the EA always changes back to default(pink box)

hi, heres a gu 5min chart, tho its not of preferred tf as stated in #1.

hugh, may i ask how big the size of the trend before retracement you would recommend? for this case, if i were to miss the 38.2 entry price and it goes higher but is still not invalidated, do u still recommend catching the move?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Sure wish this setup hadn't cancelled

--- 帖子 #406 ---
The trade looks reasonable enough but yes the 5 min timeframe is a bit wild. No reason why you shouldn't be able to trade it well with some practise though.

The ea settings cannot be changed in the actual file itself because it is an ex4 file. When you apply it to a chart you can change the settings and those settings will apply to that chart. I recommend you set up a template with the desired settings and then when you see a trade you want to take just apply the template and the settings will be ok.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Shame about gu, would've hit tp1 already I believe?

Audusd and audcad running ok at the moment. I've got gold short pending too.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Now I can see the bigger picture with that chart I can see why you were interested in that trade! Oh well, no use crying over the missed ones.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I don't know if anyone else has done this? I took a long on eurchf the other day just above 1.20. It's not a system trade, it's just something I noticed. The Swiss National Bank have declared 1.20 the lowest they will let the pair go and they have the funds to defend it. I got in at 1.2020 with a stop loss at 1.19 so that's a 120 pip stop loss but the upside potential of the trade is huge, in the thousands. I don't believe the SNB do actually have enough funds to prop the pair up if the worlds traders decide to trade it lower and that's why I've put a fairly tight stop loss in. I'm prepared to take the risk on the trade and it's probably only a matter of time until it moves up at least a few hundred pips. I thought I would put this on here as there may still be an opportunity for a trade.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
The other thing I should mention is that it pays interest at the moment too. Not very much but interest nonetheless. If this trade takes a long time to work out I'm still collecting swap for every day I hold it open.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi hugh, thanks for the reply, but i seems to be facing some problem with the EA - it was working fine this morning..

i attached a screenshot of my chart with 3 red box areas...

as you can see

I : shows the EA with a sad face

II : shows a fib plotted with fibo renamed as SELL yet as reflected in III, no orders was being done..

i hope you dun mind me asking such a trivial question, im abit lost in this wonderful EA made by ferrufx..

can i also ask whether you put in the consideration the pip-size of the fibo area you are interested.. i drew it in the attachment.. hope i did not sound too demanding... thanks!!

The sad face means that you do not have the ea set to take trades. Go to the "common" settings box and ensure you have the ea set to take live trades without confirmation.

I am using v3 at the moment and I manually put in my position size as I am using my own money management idea.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
hi, im thinking of entering au 15mintf ..pls share your opinion thanks!

as shown, there is a confluence of fibo line marked by the purple line at the 23.6fib line of 15min tf and 50fib line of 1h tf..

may i ask if you would still consider entering when 61.8 fib line is breached? abit confused here as there are some entry despite having 61.8 line being hit.. how do you determine whether it would still be an appropriate entry?

if entry is made at 38.2, would it be wise to tp at the -23.6 fib line instead of the -38.2 since it is potentially a more resistive region?

thx for any advises!

You're making it too complicated. That market is not trending so any trade you take has less probability of working out.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
The gold short has kicked in.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Does anyone know if the EA for this system looks back if 50% level was hit? I mean when price retraces to 50% and then resumes original direction, but Fibo get's drawn and set after that retracement but before the price hits 38.2% level, will it be triggered? Does Fibo look back or not?

Thanks,

Lost

--- 帖子 #418 ---
It doesn't draw them straight away but I have noticed that it will enter the trade once the 38.2% level is breached. This is a point I have wondered about myself. Normally I have the fibs in place right from when the retrace starts but sometimes I don't and have wondered the same. I wonder if FerruFX can clarify this for us?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi hugh, from what i understand i may have applied it to a retracement of a move, is that what you are trying to single out ? how can i determine a trending and ranging move, i remember reading that the 100sma could miss trade, sry if i missed out on anything..

thanks in advance  hope i am not flooding ur thread with theses question...

--- 帖子 #420 ---
No problem for the questions. On the example you gave you were using two sets of fibs to make your analysis and that's overthinking things. You should concentrate on just finding something that's trending well and trade the retracements in that.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
hi hugh,

I am very grateful that you introduced such a simple and wonderful system. and on top of that you gave the EA as well......m trying to understand how to use the EA but i couldnt understand where to change the 'buy' and 'sell' label as you said in post#1....

Kindly explain me a little about it......i would be grateful to you a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
The credit goes to FerruFX for the ea.

When you draw a fibonacci study you get an input box to confirm after you have drawn it. Look under the "common" tab and there is a field called "name". Change the name to either BUY or SELL.

Glad you like the system, I hope you make it profitable for you.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Do you trail on either position?

And yes, scaling out is risky, works against you...cause you always reach your best target with half, but when you get stopped, you get two full punches in the nose...Scaling out is good for the fear BUT,in the  long run always works against your bottom line...

I trade fibo corrections by hand, including time fibos...trail a stop by hand and feel, BE asap...let it run...TP either 1,272 or 1,618...those trades that reach your goal with a full load make the difference...it´s all about an edge...

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yes, when the first half of the trade is closed just before 0.0% (the swing high/low for the fib) the second half trails from breakeven.

So what you are saying is that scaling out in the long run is not a good idea? I can see what you mean. I have thought about just taking full profit on both lots at 0.0% because that is much higher probability than the trade reaching the 38.2 extension. What is your opinion on that?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
but you can close up to 80%even 85-90 and allow the rest to run to final level set remember breakeven as been set just my own thought

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Yes, with the ea you can close whatever percentage you like. One problem with that though is that your position size must be divisible by the percent you want to close by.

I'm just putting ideas out there about the best way to take profit on these trades. I'm very comfortable with the entry system but maybe the exits could be improved? It's open to discussion.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Typical fib extensions are 1,272 and 1,618...1.382 is not ...you can look at any chart and see how markets react strongly to those...either cause people use it, either cause they are really magicall, or  theyre just programmed in most robots...

Closing all a 0% gives you less than 1 /1 (am I wrong here?)..

It´s  a hard question with no answer...but scaling out will definitely impact your bottom line (negatively)...

The  Golden Rule in trading: keep your winners big, and loosers small...scaling out makes sure the opposite happens:your loosers are always big and your winners are reduced by whatever you decide...

The biggest impact on performance though is neither entry, exit, or so called MM...the bigest impact is position sizing, meaning your dollar risk to stop loss...that should always be as exact as possible and always the same till you change it because you made more money last month or so (or lost)...that´s why I don´t trade lots, with OANDA you trade units...(I´m not a fan of any broker though!!).

And I trade manually cause every trade is different...trailing an auto stop has some advantages too....

These questions are  as old as trading itself...probably the best it to find the shoe that best fits your own personality...

apologize for the long answer...

--- 帖子 #428 ---
No worries but personally I see 38.2% extension respected more than any other. Closing the full trade at 0.0% would normally give a little over 1:1 r/r. Closing at 38.2% but trailing the stop from the beginning may be a better solution? As you say it's a tough decision but I am starting to see what you mean about scaling out. I'll have to give it some thought.

That said, audusd has hit tp1 so some profit taken and the rest trailing.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Gold didn't work out but I reentered as there is a trendline it hit. It only needed another small stop loss for quite a big upside gain so went with it.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
one thing that i do not understand about this method is: how come "we" draw the fibbo upside-down? or am i just to drunk right now. i always drew them the other way around so that i could visualize the 161.8 level on my chart.

does the EA compensate for this, where i to draw it my way?

and thx for an excellent thread!

--- 帖子 #431 ---
It seems logical to me that you start the fib at the bottom of the move and end it at the top in an uptrend. That way it will reach the 38.2% fib level before it reaches the 61.8% level. Maybe I'm just not drunk enough?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
yes i understand you perfectly. however if i draw the fibb like that on my mt4, then i see an extended 161.8 level on the bottom side of the chart. if it was a long trade. but what i am wondering is why it is down there since the goal is on the top side of the chart in a long trade.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
That's because it's 1.618 as opposed to 0.618. -0.618 would be the extension.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
i see. that is very nice.

does the EA compensate though? where i to draw it my way?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Yes it will still kick in if its not to close to the 38

--- 帖子 #436 ---
CAD took tp1 and tp2

AU tp1 and still running rest.

Also to the scaling ? if your hit rate is high scaling out will never have your account in the negative. Lots of trades can take you out at BE at the point where you would have tp1 but never reach a final target. Never hurts to take some off. IMOP

--- 帖子 #437 ---
AU daily closed the other half of my AU I had running should get a bounce here will see what happens. Pending order in place.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
The EA doesn't look back. It must be on with the Fibo at the time of the retrace level touch/cross.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
You could be right, if you've got high probability of hitting tp1 then you're not taking too many full losses anyway. The times that you hit tp1 and then go on to hit tp2 will easily cover the odd full loss. Tp1 is usually more than 1:1 anyway.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
If you're actively trading the system then you will be in the right place at the right time anyway.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Maybe not if trading 20 pairs on the M1 chart !!!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Lol, no, maybe not.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I think I have found a way to inform our trading decisions in a more intelligent manner. This may seem obvious but you can increase your probability by trading a lower timeframe chart in the direction of a higher timeframe trend. Maybe this kind of analysis would be useful for this system? If you look at the pairs that have been the easiest and best to trade recently such as audusd you will see that on the weekly chart the stochastics have been moving down smoothly. As a result more or less any trend following technique on the 4 hour chart would have made nice money. Now, I really like the fib entry method and the ea but the question I have had recently is how can we put ourselves in the right place at the right time to catch this sort of move. Maybe using stochastics on a weekly chart might be the answer or maybe there is something better? I'm going to give it some thought and do a lot of testing and if I find anything worth incorporating into the system I will update the first page. At the moment it seems the system is to trade pullbacks in trends but we're yet to properly outline what exactly is a trend and how to spot when a trend is possibly going to begin. If we could do that and then apply our fib method then our probability would go through the roof.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
i use macd divergence to determine the continuation of the trend. to be frank, if the next wave is not stronger in the macd histogram i say it is no longer trending and a reversal is to be expected.

what do you guys think about this?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
i have read the entire thread twice now. but there is something i do not understand with the EA. i have this fibbo on my chart and as i understand it the way i have it setup it should have filled an order for me + sold 50% of the position by now.

can anyone comment?

Close_Partial_At_TP1_Percent = 50

Slippage = 2

Level_retrace = 0.48

Level_pending = 0.5

Level_TP1 = 0.236

Level_TP2 = -0.618

Level_SL = 0.618

Level_cancel = 0.618

and yes the expert advisors button is green.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Did you name the fib a buy ?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
yes i just turned that off afterwards for the picture. i use another EA for another method of trading so i already know about the smileyface.

the fibbo was named BUY

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Not sure then the trade looks valid.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
thank you anyway. we'll leave this to the big boys to sort out

--- 帖子 #451 ---
You appear to have parameters in the fib box that are not on your chart display.  This may be the problem.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
can you please explain further? do i need to add all the levels in my fibb so that they correspond to the EA?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
You have 0.48 set as the retrace level; and yes, the fib levels should probably match.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
You set retrace at the 48 level and the pending at 50. You are trading the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
ah i see now i get it.

i need to set the retrace level to 52 and enter at 50 and cancel at 61.8.

in my previous example i wanted to go long at 50 so im thinking once that level has been touched, 52 is close, then the fibbo enters me long at 50. and if price goes beyond 61.8 level before my order being executed the trade is invalidated. have i understood it correctly now?

can i also ask, was there a plan to add a "move to be on X amount of pips/level" to the EA? im thinking the 0 level would be good to use here.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
What is the purpose of setting the retrace and pending levels so close to each other ?

???

--- 帖子 #457 ---
the idea is to be able to enter at the 50 level. i dont know how close the activatorlevel needs to be, i just guessed there.

about the move to break even.. i might have missread something in the thread. im just thinking out loud sorry

--- 帖子 #458 ---
In any case, the retrace must be after the pending level (below for a buy and above for a sell).

The distance between these 2 levels must be at least the difference allowed by your broker between the pending order and the current price.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
then i understand.

can i ask one more thing about the EA? is it true, yes or no, that once the pending level has been reached the order to go long/short in the market is put at the desired level regardless of the spread? meaning is the order placed there if it is to close because of spread, is the order still there? will price have to go away from the level once more in order for it to be activated or is the order not placed because it is to close?

--- 帖子 #460 ---
BUYSTOP is triggered by Ask price

SELLSTOP is triggered by Bid price

So this is normal to see the BUYSTOP to be triggered before the chart price reach the pending ... because the Ask is above by the spread.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
thank you. then i know how to work this

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Phew, I'm glad I came in towards the end of all this.

What you are trying to do is enter the trade at the 50% level once it has been breached so if the price reverses there then you're in the trade early. I don't see the point. Half the time the price will continue on and invalidate the trade, or in your case cause a loss because you'd be in the trade. The point of entering once the price starts going back in the direction of the trend again is so that you are trading with the momentum.

Ok, this is my recommendation and you do what you like but I recommend you to stick to the plan which is wait til price retraces to the 50% level. Then let the ea place the pending order the other side of the 38.2 and the stop loss the other side of the 61.8. Invalidate the trade at 75% and take profit at 0.0 or close half and let the other half run to the 38.2 extension. Simple.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Simple yes ... All is very well explained in post #1 ! All is set as default in the EA ...

--- 帖子 #464 ---
im sorry, i dont want to be rude. it is just that when i see something good i like to give my thoughts on it so that it can be even better. i'm just like that sorry. in some weird way thats me saying i like this stuff.

one thing that i always thought about with fibbos is that the "best" way to use them is to enter at the 50 level. that is an idea i've had in my head for a long time. even though this might not be possible/viable.. it is something that i believed in.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
this is my 1st trade for today - UC 15min tf

entered manually as EA didnt trigger as i entered after 38.2 is hit.

can i ask some question, for this case, do i jus put a buy limit at the tp levels if i want to take partial profit ? regarding the EA, is the spread alr factored into at the different levels or do i need to do some manual adjustment?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

most importantly, what are your views on this? isit trending ?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
The spread is factored in and the ea automatically takes half profit at the 0.0% level (the last swing low).

Looks like a good trade, usdcad is pulling back from a resistance level on the daily so could well work out.

HI hugh, thanks for the reply, 15min tf stop loss should have been hit in this demo account, although im not out.. any comments on this following chart? hope i didnt over-evaluate again :x

pls advise if its a valid setup in the 1h chart.. and if the 1h tf is considered trending, i've got some problem with identifying trending movement ..

grey fibo=1h

brown fibo= 15min

for this case, if 1h is valid, should i set my sl for 15min tf to ~61.8?

I don´t want to mess with the original plan...but just had this idea.

If we consider 0,786 to be the deepest the market could go...then how about reversing there, which is the equivalent of 0,382 on the opposite side...

Basically the whole swing is a full bar of a higher time frame, and we are placing inside trades, sooner or later it will break in either direction....and of course, it could (and will) chop around those levels sometimes...

I will give it a try...I trade mostly EURUSD 1 min, and on some situations I reverse, most times I at least recover the previous loss..

Basically you look at a swing, no matter which time frame, and the big question is: which side will be broken first? answer that "often" correctly , and you should be rich soon..

just a thought....

Hugh,

I couldn't agree more - there is always going to be anomolies in any market when looking at different time frames. I've cut back to some quite basic views on this which is to look at the daily's of ALL those pairs you trade regularly. I make notes each day (yeh I know a ball ache) of the main trend then go to the 4hr and 1 hr charts to see if there are any suitable set ups. If not on the higher time frames then drill down to a lower one again. I write them down and review them throughout the day - which reinforces my original trading thoughts. I really want to see 2 higher time frames doing the same thing.

Examples attached - this kind of trending on two higher time frames gives me confidence that at least I'm going in the right direction - and if the trade goes against me I know there is nothing better I could have done.

On the example attached GBPJPY are in downtrends on the 4Hr and 60 min but could be setting up for a bounce on the daily - the truth is we just don't know. All we can do is trade the system and with some knowledge of the markets know that our system gives us an edge - a higher probability that the direction we have chosen for our trade is correct.

As it happens I have a pending order for GBPJPY short entry below the 128.74 level - but someone else may be looking at the daily and thinking to go long.

To recap - all i'm saying is I look at the higher time frames every day and have a plan from there - I like this system and with the help of simple trendlines to determine direction it helps me to make decisions based on what I see.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Great post. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Yes, that makes sense. If a higher timeframe gives a signal for a short then anticipating a downtrend on a lower timeframe does make sense. Whether that downtrend does unfold or is actually tradeable, ie giving smooth signals, is another thing but at least then you are in the right place at the right time when everything does go to plan. I think you should have minimal losses trying to trade short in this way and when you do hit a good trend you can squeeze it for all it's worth. Definitely something I'm looking into. Thanks for the post and the charts.

Tough call Raggs. Looks like price is being squeezed into a range on higher time frames. GBP & JPY both seem to be falling together, which may support the cosolidation outlook. A corrective retracement of the prior impulse wave could reach the 130.50 area. Just goes to show how wonderful Forex trading is, doesn't it? I mean our different views of the market.

What do you think, Raggs?

If you took the trade on the 4 hour chart then stick to the 4 hour chart.

[quote=Hugh Briss;5493595]I only started this thread a few weeks ago but already it has evolved into something better.

With all due respect Hugh....it´s a simple idea...and so far effective.

My trading plan (a little changed).

Find a nice swing (H or 4 H)

Wait till price hovers around the middle (50%)

Place 2  pending limit orders: long and short at either side (0,382 /0,786 which is the opposite)

Trail stop (auto), set at the same at opposite level.

T Profit at 1,272 either side.

Let the market decide direction.

No scaling down.

Once one side of the swing is breached, cancell the opposite order and let the open position run.

Come back a few hours later to fill the excell file with the results, and put some new orders.

So far I have an awsome performance which I expect to level down a good bit...(too good to be true)..

The idea is: keep profits big, loosers small...

Auto but no EA, just standard Limit orders, Trailing stops and Take profits.

So far the R expectancy is 0,724, positive, 80% winners.(real money)

Too few trades so far to validate...want to get at least 5 a day..after a month (100 trades) I will be more confident.

Proposal: who ever wants, post your results, maybe in terms of R, so you don´t have to show your $ levels...so we can collectively test the best setups, stops,TP etc...

My minimum expectancy to consider it worth the effort:

100 Trades

40% winners:35 R (some are a little bigger than 1, some a little smaller)

60% loosers: -30 R (average looser: 0,5, remember I trail a stop)

That´s a thin 0,05R expectancy, if it´s consistent it would still make money..an edge...is an edge...

Enjoy the weekend...

hello hugh....

i am a new trader... been trading for about 3-4 months and found that fibo method is the best for me.... i have quite the same method as you have.

50% retracement. my problem is sometimes the price didnt retrace but move to break 100% fibo...

i found that your method is good. i trade directly once the price touch 50%. instead of doing that, you choose to place buy/sell stop. looks like it will filter some bad trades.

can i join this thread and maybe post some of my set up ??

hugh, how to find a good TP ?? i dont understand how to use Fibo expansion...

and then, can anyone help me how to use the EA ?? how to install it and activate it ?? since i am new in trading, i have no experience using EA....

will the EA place 2 buy/sell orders at the same position ??

Attached the updated version. It has a 2nd partial closure option.

If you set "Close_Partial_At_TP2_Percent" to 0, the EA will act normally like version 4.

If set to a percent value, the EA will partial close at "Level_TP2" and the remaining lot will continue until "Level_TP3".

Tested only on backtester (market closed) ... so let me know.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
i am so new in trading and dont know anything about EA...

can you tell me how to install, set up and use it ??

we still trade manually right ??

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Everything is well detailled in this thread. You should read the whole thread before jump with the EA ...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hello, yes, post all your setups. The fib extension is just a way of predicting where the next impulse wave will come to an end. There are many good books about fib trading, perhaps a good idea to read one or two?

There is also lots of info about how to use ea's if you look.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Try using the zigzag indicator, lots of times that picks out the perfect swing highs/lows.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
thanks, i will surely read whole of this thread...

still in some early pages now...

Thank you very much I will test at the open if something sets up.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Nothing better than backtesting it takes alot of chart time. Fibs are subjective so theres no right way.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thanks for the comments. This thread is definietley about a team effort to use and improve a simple method. There are some excellent contributors to this thread that make it what it is. My part was just having the simple idea but with the help of others I believe we have created something good.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
what do you guys think of this setup, trend reversal or a continuation of the downtrend?

Impossible to tell, use a sensible position size.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I trade ranges, and I also like this theory too, my account balance can handle this size position, thanks.

And not too fond of EA's. I like to take all my trades manually, who know's what the future holds.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
This EA isn't trading alone. It trades only where you are telling him to trade ... And once the trade is entered, even if your platform shud down, you have target/stop in place. I can't see the risk with this EA.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I agree, this is anything but set and forget. It takes some half sensible analysis to get the best out of it.

All looks good. Shame we didn't get more out of the eurusd trade but tp1 hit so no complaints.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
We might have a new setup (Short) on EU H4 in few hours ... (new high/low at 3211/2994)

--- 帖子 #543 ---
never mind hugh... we will get another opportunity soon i think....

hmm, my long term analysis for AUD/USD should be bullish power...

but the price seems to go down....

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Audusd tough to call at the moment, go careful.

I agree with Ferru about the eurusd. Pulling back nicely.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
500+ postings on this thread in less than a month!

I think its popularity speaks for itself - it is in essence a great sharing thread that I am sure we are all learning from.

A big thanks to Hugh is in order.

Following up on my last post re GBPJPY on Friday.

I entered (short) on the 4Hr chart only to get stopped out just above the 61.8 Fibo. Life is easy in hindsight and although there are 'rules' in this strategy it pays to look a little closer sometimes. The stop was in place (I think correctly) but I should have given it a little more 'wiggle' room due to the fact it 'nearly' breached the 75% level AND there was a prior high I did not take into consideration.

On the positive side my overall assesment was correct - hey ho bitter sweet.

We live and learn and continue to trade another day - risk is always there and should be embraced.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
That's really hard luck, must have stopped you out by a few pips. That's the thing with having rigid stop losses, they're not always going to work. Nothing wrong with extending it a little if the situation warrants I think.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Yes. Originally both cancel and SL levels were the same at 61.8. Now putting the cancel at 75, we are allowing a new resistance (high) to set above the SL ...

--- 帖子 #548 ---
hugh,

want to ask you...

why dont you place the PO in 50% after the price touch 61.8% ??

maybe the opportunity will not be as many as our current rule...

but i think that the risk and reward ratio will be much better...

--- 帖子 #549 ---
And here's the sweet side EURUSD 4hr.

Using TradeStation I don't have the luxury of having my stop move down automatically at b/e (although I'm working on it).

The great thing about the 4hr charts is you have the luxury of time to manage them manually if you can't have the trade manage itself.

So now we have an interesting trade - we have taken profits at target 1. B/E is near the 75% fibo on the current down leg after re-drawing to the latest low.

2 choices

1) let the trade run its course

2) enter again if we get the set up conditions re-occurring

What would you do?? How about a survey on this?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
The price can chop around the 50 and 61.8 levels while the immediate trend is in it's transition phase. I think keeping the entry at 38.2 would be safer.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
In my opinion, a reentry would be a good choice as the 1st trade is definitively at profit (2nd half at BE).

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thx...

just did some manual backtest... and i think you are right...

will stick with our rule...

--- 帖子 #553 ---
watch out on EU and GU guys... i think both pairs will touch 50% soon...

haha

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Most euro pairs are pulling back nicely now.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I wasn't here to see this this morning but shrink your chart a little and always look left this is big demand zone so you could have expected a bounce so its best to protect your pips.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Nice setup on the EUR/AUD

http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n...ml/euraud1.jpg

--- 帖子 #557 ---
well I'm seeing it a little different bigger TF though so both could work.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
hmmm... my set up is a sell set up... in H4....

http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/a...zic/EURAUD.png

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Yes, that makes sense in hindsight. I think what we are finding is that a rigid stop loss and take profit is not always the best way to go. I recommend what TG and Raggs are suggesting and to look at the previous swing high/low points and use those for stops and targets. The ea is useful to set the trade up when you're away from the computer but once it's setup and you have five minutes just check that the stop loss is in the optimum place. With the take profits tp1 seems to be hit more often than not but tp2 is not and probably for very good reason when you look at supply/demand/support/resistance areas (I know they are not the same). I suggest identifying strong areas and using those levels for tp2. It makes sense to bank profits at these levels rather than continualy see your profit eroded by these huge bounces. Let's see how this works in practise. Euro pairs still setting up this morning but not so smoothly. I like euraud the best because of the trendline.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Yep, I'm going for the sell trade too. (for a clue look at weekly stochs)

--- 帖子 #561 ---
hugh,

will you trade every opportunity that you found ??

for example, maybe, today you find 10 opportunities, will you trade it all ??

if yes, how do you do your money management ??

i am thinking on taking every trade opportunity but worried about risk.

usually, i use 2.5% risk every day, but after change my habit with semi long term trade (at least H1 or H4 TF), i found that the opportunity doesnt come every day

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I try and stay away from doubling up on the same currency too much. At the moment all the euro pairs look more or less tradeable but because they tend to move together I wouldn't trade them all, I'm only looking to trade the best looking trades. The smoother the trend and the clearer the setup the better. In terms of risk I am happy to risk 2% per trade and take up to 3 or 4 at a time so I will have up to 8% of my account at risk at any one time but the strike rate of tp1 is pretty high so I'm comfortable with the risk.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
oww... i see...

so beside EUR/AUD, what pairs that you will trade today ??

currently, i just found USD/CHF which has a good set up i think...

--- 帖子 #564 ---
But then usdchf is more or less an exact mirror of eurusd so that's doubling up your risk too. I'm watching euraud and eurusd, similar but didfferent enough and clearer setups than eurjpy and eurnzd.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
ok, now i understand why you just choose one set up for some similar pairs....

because when one set up lost, we will lost the other too...

hehe, thx hugh....

just lost GU... 1% account, no worry

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Yes be careful with gbpusd at the moment, it's not trending anywhere very smoothly.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
hugh u heve here on ff the best method no 1

but one need to work in order make many, thise is not mambo jumbo super ea.

if the mony manegment was included into the semi ea it mayt be great.

did u try it on the 1 m chart?

--- 帖子 #568 ---
ferrufx first big tanks for the  ea, can u had a mony mangment option to it?

thet mayt be very helpfull.

thanks and cheers

--- 帖子 #569 ---
-er-, I believe that from v4 onwards it has money management included. I don't find it too much hard work to calculate my own money management and alter the ea accordingly.

Not tried it on 1 min charts as I have no desire to.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Eurusd did breach the 75% level but if it starts moving smoothly down I would still be interested in the short trade. I think maybe euraud may be the safest trade?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
You have already all you need in the EA about MM.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
For traders interested in that sort of thing eurnzd 4 hour is forming a lovely outside bar setup near the 100 and 200 sma's and the stochs (I use 8,3,3 low/high) look nice too. Also look at the weekly stochs. It's tempting to trade this sort of setup as it's good probability but you can't just sell every pair when the eur looks weak because what happens if they all snap the other way together?!

--- 帖子 #573 ---
ok thanks.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
yes, i think so... try to make a trendline and it looks good...

will you trade both (EUR/AUD and EUR/USD) ??
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Yes, I think I will trade both. Of course if one loses they both lose but you never know, one may run further than the other so in a way it's spreading the risk.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
AUD looking better I think. There is potentially more room for it to reach tp2 which is just above a support area (but what do i know) :-)

--- 帖子 #577 ---
But I am looking at the 60min and price is just trading at the daily PP which might act as support. Would want to see a good close below before entering on the 4HR - but does this mean I am not trading the 'system'. We can all find excuses to enter or not enter a trade.

Over to you guys

--- 帖子 #578 ---
You can incorporate other types of analysis into the system if you want which means you may not take the trade. There is nothing wrong with not taking the trade if you are not comfortable with it. I'm still happy to sell eurusd and euraud, audusd hasn't pulled back as smoothly. (which doesn't mean it won't work out)

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Euraud in play.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
yes....

and i think AUD/USD is on its way to make a good/smooth uptrend...

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Could be, weekly stochs are low and rising.

I don't know if anyone looked at eurnzd that I flagged up earlier? Looks like a good trade now.

--- 帖子 #582 ---

Missed it! but I'm short EURAUD which is going same way - but yes NZD looks nice.

BTW - managed to sort auto ordering in TS but can't get it to cancel if goes past 75% or 25% Fibo's - still trying

--- 帖子 #583 ---
As long as you can take a look every now and then you should be ok though?

That eurnzd was begging for a pending sell order below the low of that outside bar. Still, euraud is compensating!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
wow, yes.... i dont think it's late to place a PO now... still above 38%...

will trade this...

--- 帖子 #585 ---
The fib trade should still work out but wouldn't it be nice to have traded the outside bar signal?!

--- 帖子 #586 ---
yes... but it's late for me i think for outside bar signal

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Lots of cancelled setups today. Long EAUD triggered will see what happens.

Hugh Briss i must say, i very much like what - er - is doing here. But i still don't fully understand from and where to draw the fibbo's. Perhaps somebody would be so kind as to explain this further?

Im not saying im an idiot, i i just don't see why some of you pick one point and not an adjacent one. Is there some logic or it is all just feeling?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Just plot a ZZ on your chart and you will have your high and low points.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
is this correctly done?

the low was broken and followed by a new low. i put my 0 level at 82,99 and selected my 100 level at the latest zigzag highpoint. im thinking its a short and continuing the trend yes?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Yes. This chart would have given you at least TP#1.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
ok. thank you

what about the current state of aud/jpy m15? im thinking short possibly?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
AJ 15min show an UP trend ... maybe the end ... But in my opinion, it's little bit early for looking for a short setup.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
hi ferrufx if u r alredy here can u help me out , the ea doesnt put orders

i cant figure out what mayt be the problem.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
ah yes you are correct FerruFx. i eyeballed the swing high there and was of by a few pips.

My logic is 83,91 swing created the last leg up to the currently highest point of the day and as such has to be invalidated in order to become a short trend. I didn't see that until looking closer. thx

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Did you set correctly your Fibo on chart ?

Did you applied the EA before the retrace level was reached ?

Did you allowed live trading on your platform (smiley face in top right corner) ?

Do you have error messages in the experts and journal tabs ?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
now its open  sell or buy, but white out sl and tp, shold i give  him "ask manual confimetion",its pop up evry coupel of second when i do  thet.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
No need manual confirmation.

Is there any error message in the experts and journal tabs after the order was opened ?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Euraud pulling back a bit today but eurusd doing ok.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
ok its work now, thanks alot!!!(but its pop up whan i gave him manual confirmation , so i close the simaily , its ok?)

--- 帖子 #609 ---
its keep on pop up , pluse it dont put  tp on the zero fib(only on the 138).

no error on the  journal.

why its pop up all the time?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
its ok thet there is no tp on the zero line?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
0 level isn't a TP but a partial close. Only the final TP (TP#2 or TP#3) is sent to broker.

If the pop up is the MT4 manual confirmation, just unselect it in the comon tab.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
i will try it, thanks.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I think someone (turbo?) mentioned EURJPY possibly turning and setting up on the daily.

Had a look and did not want all that risk on the daily so went down to 60 min and saw a set up long. Looks to be working OK.

If we pass previous high on 13th could then be viable for daily?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Yep I'm in on the daily no more risk just have to lower your lot size for the bigger sl risk is the same on all trades.

Also don't really see the hourly setup but thats just me.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
HI Hugh and all,

I want to ask what are risk/reward ratios per trade, how many wining trades are vs. losing ones, and what is amount of pips won per day and total? I hope I'm not asking too much. Btw, great strategy! Love it!

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I know what you mean about the set up - I decided to take a mid point low on the last up move. This would reduce my risk for the same lot size and if it was going to take off on daily I would be pre-positioned.

If it works it works - if it doesn't then I'll set up on the daily above the high of the 13th and as you say reduce my lot size.

The difference with my 60min is that I would also have to be out earlier with less profits - such is life when we make these decisions

Plus by the time I'm out at TP2 - on 60min (if it gets there, that would be approx my entry point for the daily) - so I was trying to grab a quick profit before the bigger trade

--- 帖子 #617 ---
its about 1 to 1.5   1 to 2.5 rr, the amount of pips depends on u r trades(the time frame u trade).

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Thanks -er-

I took a smaler TF swing and added to my daily EAUD trade.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I've made 70 pips today trading EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, AUDUSD and NZDUSD. I took only one trade per pair with profit level at 0,0%. All trades were on 5 min TF. I guess lower Tf's are also ok.

Well done, see if you can do the same today!

Update charts for EURJPY trades

60min hit tp 1 and 2

Now in on daily

--- 帖子 #623 ---
hi hugh, what kind of market do you think we are experiencing? ranging or trending? seems pretty hard to trade, or maybe i still lack experience

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Well, today I haven't done so well... total minus 8 pips :/ But, I've been thinking of something else. I think correlation can help us improve our trading. We know that highly correlated pairs move in same direction. We also know that they move at different speed: faster pair will move faster, reverse faster and will do all this in greater amount of pips. Now, if we could determine which pair is faster, if we could somehow calculate the momentum of both pairs and than compare it,then we could without fear trade the slower pair in direction of faster  one, since we know the correlation factor. If faster pair reverses, then the slower one will do the same. This is just a simple idea, any thoughts on this?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #625 ---
All eur pairs very choppy on the 4 hour at the moment. Maybe they are smoother on lower timeframes but not very easy to trade at the moment. When things are trending it becomes a lot easier to trade.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Imo i find a small divergence on eur/usd m5. After that perhaps we can extend to the 1,618. We shall se

Seem good, Turboguru. What are your results so far? How many wining trades have you had?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Sorry, been busy for a while but I will get back to posting trades next week. It seems that a lot of traders are finding success trading this way, it's a good way to trade. I have lost only a handful of trades since I started. Eurusd was one of them the other day.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Well I have always like trading fibs just when I get home from work or was asleep things would have happened the EA is the bomb as far as being able to set things up so its a huge help.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
since I have had the EA on the March 26th I have only lost 4 trades.

Here is the statment. Had trouble loading it so hope it opens.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
What a great statement

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thanks only possible with your EA. Some people will say that you could have still set pending orders but still not the same. Thanks very much for the work.Also to Hugh

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Closed EJ and EAUD got some things I'm seeing and want to keepas many pips as possible.CAD and AJ will let ride.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
really, great statement.  Thx, turboguru

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Ok, today was a great day. +143 pips. I've added more pairs, total of 10. This is my third day of trading this strategy and it is almost perfect. Hope it will continue like this in future

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Nice trading, well done.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Thanks and sounds like you are picking some god ones yourself keep it up.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Since TP2 is set at the -38.2 fib level, but often seems difficult to reach, I will be trading TP2 at the lower -23.6 fib level this coming week. Hopefully this smaller TP level will be overall more profitable than the longer reach to the -38.2 level.

Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I'm thinking about taking full profits at tp1, the 0.0% level. Higher probability maybe? I also think that moving to break even earlier would make sense, looking into it trading live so will take a while to see the effect.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
hi, at what level did you all place you cancel-trade ?

--- 帖子 #648 ---
The original rules cancel the pending at the 61.8% ... but Hugh uses now the 75% with better success ... if I am right ...

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi, in my three days of trading I always took 0,0% level for taking profits. It seems to be ok. I also did manual trading, I haven't used EA yet. Is anyone trading this live? Is this strategy ready to be taken live?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
seems to miss some trade at 61.8, but its less risky also, thank for the ea..

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Yes, you are right.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I always trade live for small positions until I am more comfortable with the strategy and then build the positions up slowly. Before I go in with full positions I would like to get a bit more time to feel completely comfortable with the system. There is still a bit of doubt about how we find the trades, there seems to be a little bit too much guesswork involved at the moment even though most of the time it works out. I would love to find a method to make the selection of the swings and direction more mechanical. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Yes, I agree, there is too much guesswork. I found this thread this morning and I think it could be helpful. Take a look everyone:

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi Hugh, good thread, fibs and trends, can't go too far wrong!

I know a really nice bottom and top forming fib structure... maybe something you could add...

Have a look on your charts at the end of strong trending moves...

So you could trade it long with the trend and then look for this structure to trade the counter move...

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Yes, looks interesting. Of course we could just do the leg work ourselves and draw our own support and resistance levels and trend analysis before taking a trade.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi 60, yes, looks interesting too. I think trendline breaks that signify the end of a trend can be useful for pointing the direction too. All the ideas are there, just got to see if we can figure out if we can put into words what we are looking for to take a trade! Thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Yes, we could, and we do. But that does not exclude guesswork... Hmm... maybe we could even employ Elliot waves, the three cardinal rules? But that also  does not make the system mechanical... Hugh, I think you are on to something big with this and I'll do my best to help you and other traders make this a long term success.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Thanks, that's what this thread is all about.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Ok, let's think this through. I used to do a lot of eod trading (end of day) and back then I would look at monthly and weekly charts and be able to build a picture of where the nearest s/r levels were, what the overall trend was and where I expected the price to go IF those levels held and IF that trend continued. So I've been thinking and thinking about how we can improve this system so that we're not just finding a swing, drawing a fib study and hoping it will work out. If you have seen any of my other systems you will know that I like using stochastics to gauge the strength of pullbacks and to give me information about the current direction of the momentum. I have been using them for quite a long time now and I am fully aware of their limitations. I strongly believe that with a bit of work done on a weekend we can build a picture of what will POSSIBLY happen over the coming week and that this will give us the extra edge we need to take this from a good but unpolished system to a truly awesome system.

Here's my analysis of eurusd for next week. The weekly stochs are pointing down and the general trend is down although 1.30 is providing strong support and last week gave us a large bullish candle. Given the climate in the euro zone and the general stability (or perceived stability) in the US economy I can see no reason to be bullish this pair at this time. It is for this reason that I would expect that downwards trendline and the upcoming round numbers of either 1.3250 or 1.3300 to act as resistance and the downwards move will resume. If this does actually transpire and the price moves downwards I will trade it accordingly on the 4 hour chart expecting a nice couple of tradeable swings down to 1.30 and possibly below. If the price breaks those resistance levels and that trendline I would look for a pullback to the top of the trendline and would trade it long. If the price stays in a range and shows no valid swings in one direction or the other then I will not trade this pair next week.

I will complete similar analyses for every other pair with trendlines, stochs and horizontal s/r and then just trade the plan accordingly.

Does anyone have any comments on this approach?

Also I am going to take profit at the 0.0% level, the last swing high/low. I believe the risk reward ratio combined with the probability of the trade hitting that level will still provide a profitable system. Also I am considering moving to break even once the trade has reached the 20% level which will be roughly halfway between 38.2 where we entered the trade and 0.0. FerruFX, thank you kindly for your work on the ea so far but I wonder if you could incorporate these new rules into a seperate version for testing? So the parameters are roughly the same, retrace to 50%, place the trade at 38.2, take full profit at 0.0 and optional move to break even at 20%? I would be grateful if you could incorporate this change? Thanks.

As the week progresses and I get evidence that my analysis is correct in either direction then I will be looking for trendlines and channels that I can use to inform my trades even more.

Thanks to everyone who has followed this thread so far, voted for it and contributed their time and effort to make this thread what it is. I hope we can all continue to work together to really push this system to the highest level of achievement.

Eurjpy telling a similar story, 105.50 and 110 the round numbers involved. It looks as though eurjpy may have further to move up before it turns but who knows?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Euraud is interesting. Weekly stochs just crossed in a downtrend. A reasonable trendline and two levels that stand out, 1.26 and 1.29. On the 4 hour chart 1.2750 also looks like a relevant level. If I was to trade this short next week I would like to see a break below 1.26 and a pullback to that level. To the upside a break of 1.2750, a move to 1.29 and then a pullback to 1.2750 would also look nice for a long trade.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Eurnzd similar but it is actually setting up quite nicely already for a short on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Eurcad looking a little choppy on the weekly chart, nothing to really see on the daily. Gbpusd the same story.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Here's gbpchf. On the weekly chart the stochs have been moving rapidly up the chart but are now overbought and the pair is reaching a strong resistance level at 1.48. We can also see this on the daily chart, stochs quite high already and the 1.48 level approaching. On the 4 hour chart we can see lots of little s/r levels. Although I can't see any particular strength in any of these a few do stand out. First is the obvious 1.48 level at the top but then 1.4525 and then 1.4350. Next week I will be looking for a long trade from the current position (4 hour stochs low and room to move up still I think). After a move to 1.48 I will look for evidence of a move down and I want to see some trendlines breaking or holding. A move below 1.4525 and a pullback to test that level would be tradeable, may not happen next week though. A move above 1.48 and a retest of that from above will be a trade too.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Gbpjpy similar to eurjpy. Gbpcad choppy. Gbpnzd I don't have enough data for at the moment on the weeky, I will try and download some next week as I'm not connected at the moment for some reason.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Gbpaud stochs haven't crossed on the weekly yet but the trend is down similar to euraud. On the daily I can see an interesting trendline and two fairly strong s/r levels, 1.5250 and 1.5675. On the 4 hour chart 1.55 also stands out as a level. 4 hour stochs are high, crossed and falling so there is a possibility the trend will turn around here in which case I would want to see that trendline broken and a move to 1.5250. If that level holds and the price pulls back there could be a short trade there. If the price breaks that level and then retests it there will be a short trade there. If the price breaks higher then a retest of 1.5675 should give a valid long trade.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Audusd is making it's mind up at the moment. I expect this pair to be a little sideways this week. We've had a nice tradeable channel downwards over the last 7 or 8 weeks but found support at 1.0225. On the 4 hour chart we can see the upper channel line broken and acting as support in conjunction with 1.0310. Next resistance is at 1.0450. To the downside a move to 1.0225 and a pullback could give a short trade. A break and retest of that level should give a short trade too. To the upside I'd want to see a break of 1.0450 and a retest of that level to give a long trade.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I'll try and do some more pairs tomorrow. I hope this all makes sense? For me it's like writing my trading plan for the following week and having it mapped out on the chart what I think will possibly happen and what I will do if it does. I think this will make trading it an altogether more comfortable experience.

--- 帖子 #672 ---

Looking forward to another good week using this trading plan.

No problem, this is what it's all about.

always a good sign someone knows what theyre talking about when they include some higher tf analysis...

you got to know where its coming from and where its gonna end!!

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Thanks fella, this could be the missing piece for this puzzle. The system on it's own is fine, trends and fibs, but some work on the weekends could pay off big. I'm feeling a whole lot better already just for having done the analysis. Whatever happens next week I'll know how to react.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
By the way, did you ever wonder what the highest rated trading system thread on forex factory is? Take a look, click sort by rating on the trading systems menu to display highest first... That's no big deal as it only takes 13 5* ratings and you can guarantee that now I've posted this some schmuck will rate it a 1*! Oh well, nice while it lasted

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Thanks for posting this. How well does it work in practice? To use the ea we need to draw the fibs by hand anyway and I'm not sure how well an auto indicator would do it but I'll have a look on Monday.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Great work, Hugh, Though it does not work for me, since I'm using 5 min Tf's, I think your analysis is good. There is one almost perfect way to determine s/r levels. You can simply use volume. Put volume indicator on 1 hour chart and look for highest volume readings in a day. Then simply put horizontal line on the close of the candle which had highest volume reading. It is almost prefect to a pip. I will try to upload some pictures later.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Notice how last three days price obeyed early drawn s/r levels.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Yes, with lower timeframes you're mainly just going to be following the trend but for higher timeframes I think we needed some sense of direction.

I'll look into the volume thing, thanks for pointing it out, an interesting idea.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I suggest that everyone gets familiar with Supply/Demand and loose the indicators. Indicators will only give you a bias and thats the worst thing that you can have is a bias. You can map out fibs from a Higher TF to lower and just about road map the pullbacks not 100% but a huge help. For me I don't consider a run up or down until the pullback has reached the 50 if it only stops at a 38 its not finished. Lots of looking back and plotting out fibs is really the quickest way to learn. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Here you go!

The default "Level_SLtoBE" is set to 20% ... If you don't want to use it, just set it at TP2 or TP3.

Hope that will help.

Excellent, thank you very much again.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
yeah, as always its a pro traders observation that I have copied... I know nothing, but i'm good at listening to the right people...heheheh

Love that price action to, I trade that all the time...

the slow crawl back down to a trigger point then one explosive candle engulfing the last 7 or so hours.... not hard to see it was going long for the session... simple repeating patterns...

--- 帖子 #686 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Guys, I have noticed that, the shorter the trend is on which we apply fibbs, the worse is risk/reward ratio. On 5 min TF I had risk/reward 1:2 when my reward was 40 pips, and I had risk/reward 3:1 when my reward was 6 pips. I don't know where I'm going with this, I'm just pointing it out.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Maybe we should only look for setups which only have positive risk/reward ratio...

--- 帖子 #689 ---
The risk/reward ratio is only important when you also know what your win/loss ratio is... from that you can calculate how much account balance to risk...

A 1/1 risk to reward will be fine if your win/loss is sufficient and you are risking the right amount...

Do a search on "chris capre risk of ruin table"... then you just need data from your trading

--- 帖子 #690 ---
And also to be completely honest I don't think anyone has compiled detailed profit/loss, risk/reward and/or win/loss data anyway. I think to take this to a higher level we're going to have to put in the detailed work over a period of time. So far there are not many traders here telling us they have taken multiple losses trading this system, for the most part the anecdotal evidence suggests a very profitable system with very low stress trading (with the ea). I'm here to see this through to the end so I am more than prepared to put the required work in to definitively be able to say, this is a profitable system worth following.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Thanks, I will do the search.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
One more thing: I did a back testing and it appears that setups with better risk/reward ratio were more successful. In fact, all negative trades I saw in my back testing had a poor risk/reward ratio. I think this is because when you put your fibbs on a bigger trend, you are trading more important moves. The smaller moves appear to be just noise, or even counter trend trading.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I do blocks of 100 trades, updating my data every 4 weeks or so...

As for this strategy being profitable, I can't see why it wouldn't be with the right money management..

I will do a few fib trades next week in between my H4 stuff..

--- 帖子 #694 ---
That makes a lot of sense, 100 trades would amount to a meaningful data set to work with. Maybe a quarterly evaluation would be a good idea? I will start tracking trades and recording data as from tomorrow and come up with a spreadsheet with the information at the end of June.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I've done more analyses on the other pairs but as they are fairly minor pairs and you get the general idea of what I am doing I won't post them all. I will post during the week as and when trades set up and trigger.

Liquidity Gaps Webinar

this webinar gives a good explanation why fibs should work, why we get pull backs after impulse waves..

I really rate this trader, a proven track record in forex and one of the best traders to have a thread on FF...

Should be helpful for this strategy I hope..

http://www.nobrainertrades.com/2011/...-34-pulls.html

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Here are my templates for the coming week.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
With fibs being so subjective ib the way different people draw them the data that will be collected won't be the most accurate. Hard to make fib drawing mechanical. Not trying to be negative about collecting data but the subjectivness of fibs is the problem. If everyone drew them on the same swings and such the data could be accurate.Hope this makes sense.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
But the only data that is important, is on your own trading... the data fror how you pull them... after all it is going to be you taking the trades.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Yes but getting a risk/reward ratio from 5 traders will be hard to be accurate if everyones pulling fibs different.2 of the 5 might have a - rating whr the other 3 are ok. So data will be hard to me the fibs are great but to someone else they might loose with them.Not sure I'm making things clear on what I'm trying to say sorry.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
ah ok, I see your point...

The way I see it is you need a combination of things working in unison... for me its TREND/PRICE ACTION/MOMENTUM...

Seems the best trading strategies have that little mix of elements that when combined create consistent results...

If i was going to search for a fib combination...I personally would be looking at FIBS/ SUPPORT RESISTANCE/ PRICE ACTION...

Then chuck in some money management based on a chunk of trades using that strategy..... rinse and repeat...

let me see if i can find a chart using this strategy...

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Yes sounds like a good approach. I would also suggest Supply/Demand zones.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
here's an example..

AU is in a clear down trend, we want to trade the H4 so we first mark the daily s/r (magenta lines)

We then watch the retrace at the fib levels looking for some bearish price action as a trigger.

We have a bearish engulfing at 1... but it is right into an s/r level/// so we leave the trade.

Then at 2, the 61.8 retracement we get another signal, with enough room for a decent r/r to the next daily s/r...

Wether it works or not I don't know... but its kind of the route i would go down...

--- 帖子 #704 ---
TG, you are right, different traders would probably trade the same chart somewhat differently but as 60 says that's not necessarily that important. If I can make a profit with this approach of weekly chart analysis and sensible money management then that approach is something solid that I can pass on to other traders through this thread making the whole enterprise worthwhile. Of course if I can't make a profit then it doesn't mean the system is no good, just means that I failed to trade it well but that's another issue!

60min, that's exactly what I'm intending to do with the weekly and daily analysis. My main intention of the analysis is to find support and resistance levels that may break in the direction of a trend and then be retested providing the pullback for the fibs to be drawn and traded.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Yea the big thing for me I know fibs work and would hate for some bad feedback that would kill it. The EA has really helped me since alot of moves happen when at work or asleep so its really opened it up.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I'm thinking the larger moves on eur pairs may be the ones to watch, they look best on the daily chart. I'm looking for a long on gbpchf. Audusd is a short on the 4 hour chart down to 1.03. Nzdcad is a short. That's it for this evening, when the market opens I'll let the ea's do their thing and see how it looks in the morning.

I've reduced my position size to enable me to take the potential trades on the daily chart. Also I prefer to take all trades that are setting up and spread my risk thinly over multiple pairs rather than leaving some trades and taking others. I know correlated pairs will move together and win or lose me money together but I equally don't like the idea of leaving perfectly good setups untraded.

Hugh, What a great thread you have started. Later today I am going to read the whole thread.

ferruFx, Thank you, Thank you, and thank you. Last month  while I was trading I said to myself that I need to learn how to make a ea for how I trade and you have done it. This EA that you made is just what I wanted to learn how to build. Thank you again.

60 minuteman after seeing your chart and reading a couple of your posts I have a feeling that we trade the same. The 61 thru 88 fibs are my fib numbers I like.

I also use fib extensions for my profit targets. I just finished a course on trading harmonic patterns. These patterns are built from fib levels. Even through I have took the harmonic course and learned a lot about harmonics I do not consider my self a harmonic trader. I still consider myself as a fib trader and my peferred fib area is 61 thru 88 fibs.

I have only traded with a ea once so I do not know to much about them. After I am done reading this thread and set up the ea I will post some trades.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hello and welcome to the thread, glad you like it. Looking forward to your charts and comments.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Glad to know that it helps in your trading.

Enjoy the thread!

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hugh,

Catching up on the weekends thread. I'm a big fan of the larger time frames for setting out a trading plan. With that in mind here is my latest.

Weekly GJ in downtrend with Stochs moving lower.

Daily has broken its recent up trend and formed a lower high.

So I move to a lower time frame where I want to find a short with resistance and an o/b condition that coincides with entry level on Fib.

In this instance the 30min was favourite.

Please guys if you have any comments about if I'm missing something - let me know!!

--- 帖子 #727 ---
GU added to this trade.But never had this happen. (Forex LTD demo) I was trying to move a stop and it wouldn't let me said it was to close to market. Been trading for about 4 years now and never had this happen. My live acc I can adjust at any time.So got stopped on the 1st trade funny it hit stop to the pip no biggie loss pretty much recovered but keep this in mind looking for a broker. I am using the V4 of the EA live and working flawless.Wish I could have the mq4 to make things a little easier to setup but understand if Ferru won't give it.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Sorry but I won't provide the .mq4 for this tool.

Thanks for your understanding.

hi hugh, which fib drawing is more appropriate? the first had a set up at 50fib but there is none on the second, in this case, do we have to do trail and error for all possible fib drawing at different swing points and set the EA ? or is it advisable to wait for set up on the second pic?

2nd would be the correct swing but why wouldn't you pull from top left to bottom right that swing first ? It wouldn't have triggered either way but just missed by a couple of pips.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
IMOP the area I marked in blue was a completed swing and was a solid trade. You could pull the fibs from the bottom but the success rate will be less.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
hi turboguru, thanks for the reply.

let me clarify abit, do i draw the fib from the highest/lowest swing instead of pullback/bounce in a trend ?

heres the chart for au, is this what you are saying

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

i think i missed this fib but do i determine whether is the appropriate one as a higher tf always brings another direction? as for this, would you enter even though it didnt retrace to 50 and yet hit 32.8?

sry for the long string of questions, hope you are fine

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Yes AU is down so to me thats how I would draw it and I have been letting the EA set the trades so this wouldn't have triggered. Its to hard to watch alot of charts use the EA some will trigger and some won't.The EA has helped me alot as far as setting the trades while I'm not here or looking at other charts.

I am finding 4 hour charts easiest to trade at the moment. This could be personal preference or just the way things are trading at the moment. There is nothing wrong with trading any timeframe you like but try and find trends or trend reversal points. This alone will increase your win rate.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Update on yesterdays trade.

Stopped out.

Trying to rationalise the use of the higher time frames to see if there was anything that I should have seen that would have kept me from entering.

The only thing I can see is an area of support around the 38 Fibo on the 4HR that perhaps I should have given more credit too. Also at that point there was a confluence of the 38 Fibo and a weekly pivot (not sure if anyone here uses floor pivots?) - so again may have been a heads up to caution against a short?

Also the upmove on the 4HR was perhaps too strong to trade a short on the 60min despite my analysis of going short based on weekly and daily trends.

It just goes to show how 'careful' we have to be.

On a final not on this trade maybe the 30 min charts are just too volatile for this strategy? Or it could just be me:-)

I've been trading US equities for 4 years now and FX is really new to me. I can't apply my same strategies so it's a whole new learning curve. When I think back to trading equities it took me 2 years to be comfortable with my strategy. I'm hoping this won't take quite that long given I have some experience in the markets - just not this one!

I can take losses and can deal with them psychologically so it's move on to the next trade :-)

Just need to get the entries down to a higher winning ratio.

Thx turbo,

mmmmm...... seem to be getting this all wrong at the moment. I hear what you say about GBP etc.

It's the principals I seem to be getting wrong - for instance AUDUSD as Hugh says looks good on the 15 min (I assume long) but look at the hourly and its a short!!

So my dilemma is this difference in time frames. I know different tf's will give different trends / trades but I don't seem to be able to say which one I should trade when there are alternate set ups!

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Er, no, I was short audusd too but took a loss. Sometimes it just doesn't go your way.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Well the fibs on your chart look ok so don't think its that. Try to find a pair where the bigger TF's line up 4hr,1hr and the 30. Would help if a daily but some of the pairs on daily look ranging. Theres good swings everyday the thing is FIBs are slow so you might sit all day waiting on a setup to be able to apply the FIB. When you go down to a 5 min TF. I would say trades will be 50% at best unless your have higher TF's behind it.Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #762 ---

Good Day Traders,  Only my second time using a EA. I must be doing something right I have had a order come up by the EA so I must have it installed right. So now I am going to go inside this EA and look at all the settings and try a few things out.

Turboguru you seem to have this EA down after seeing your charts that you have posted. Would you mind sharing your EA settings

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Your hourly is my 5m. This is just the way I see things doesn't make it right just right for me.

1st chart is daily and we are at a 61fib expect a bounce.

2nd is a H4 the red fibs is your swing.

3rd is my 5m chart to me thats not a bad swing with the fibs but theres a bigger story to the left hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I have only made 1 change and that was on the CHF chart I put the pending at 50% instead of the 38 and moved the sl to a 78. But all the other charts I have posted the EA is the same as Ferru set it.

Closed half of EU and CHF moved to BE will let EJ run its course.

Thx,

So you are taking the bigger time frame fib in to account - where as I was simply looking at the bigger time frame as the trend.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
any thoughts on this?
http://forex-strategies-revealed.com/fibonacci-system

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I don't like to say trend its all relative.I look from bigger TF's down. I also look at Supply/Demand. Look at "Price is everything" thread. Trends can happen in different TF's they can last days,weeks or even months. Look at the AU its been down since February but up from November is this a pullback for the next leg up?

Interesting. Nice when you get a trend but not so good when the trend slows down. Isn't that the same with most trading systems though?!

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I though maybe some of it could be incorporated into your strategy. One other thing: volatility. By definition, volatility should grow when there are some big movements on the market, like reversals. Since we trade pullbacks, volatility then should not grow, it should have low readings. Maybe some volatility indicator could help us determine weather the pullback is valid. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
You traders that have been using this for a awhile. What time frame do you think this is working the best on? Do you know what pairs this seems to work on the best so far? I don't remember if these questions had been asked earlier in the thread. If yes than I am sorry for asking again and I will go back in the thread and re read. Turboguru, thank you for posting your charts they have been a big help so far. I changed the settings on the EA so that it would take a trade on the gbp/usd 5 min time frame just to see the EA in action and it worked. Went in with just a small amount. Was up some pips and now down some pips.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
hey, i have been testing this for a while now.. i like 1h and 4h charts.

my counter question is: which pairs do you guys like?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
EU,GU,CHF,AU,UCAD,EJ and NZD probably the best only cause these are most traded.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Agree

--- 帖子 #778 ---
thanks, been trying to draw fibs the whole day but i am always stuck with different permutation of drawing - within time frame, especially when i zoom out to have a feel of the overall direction.

As for the trend reversal points, do you consider trend change when 75.0 fib is hit ?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I thought I would share my thoughts with you traders and see what you think.

Taking pull backs into trends using fibs is a great system to use and one can make a lot of pips with this method. The million dollar questions is what fib level will price make the turn at. If we all knew that answer we could all use a tighter stop loss and are r/r would be great all the time. Now when we are in a trade and some of us use a trailing stop, that works great for those that can not sit in front of a trade all day watching so that they can get the most pips out of that trade.  So I was thinking what if we had a Fib EA that would trail are entry orders. When price hit the 50 a order would be placed on the 38. If price keeps going and then hits the 61 the order would be changed from the 38 to the 50 or the EA could just place another order at the 50 to add to the one at the 38 if a trader would like to have that.  If price was to hit the 78, 88 or even the 100 for double tops or bottoms we would aways have the EA putting orders along the way for the best entry.  Now at some point we would need to have a cancel us out of are order line and we have that in this EA that we are using now. I know we somtimes get some chop on the fib levels but becasue we are using a trailing entry order for a better entry I would think we would be in a better postion to ride out the chops. I have tried this a few times by putting the orders in by hand and it has worked out great. When I did do this the pair was in a nice trend so maybe that is why it worked. I know nothing about EA's so I don't even know if one could be made.  Like I said just posting my thoughts and seeing what you traders thought.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Jag,

I agree with you and your point, if such an EA can be made, it will work even better on the higher TF like the 4 hour and above.

Yes, that point is a fantastic idea. "Moving Orders" is good if programmable.

May be even better and OCO can be incoporated in to it to place both a sell and buy order at either ends of the 50% point so what ever direction the trade takes after hitting the 50% Fib point then we will still be in the Trade for a positive pip. Just an idea.

Just my two cents.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Not a trend change exactly, I just see it as an invalidation of the current setup. Generally I no longer want to take the trade. There are times when it just hits 75 and then goes the right way again so I will override this rule sometimes.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
The idea sounds great but at some point the trade becomes invalid. The settings like they are, are pretty good. Theres alot of pairs to trade to me if you chase trades as far as moving the levels your asking for more risk.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Agreed.

--- 帖子 #784 ---

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Thank you for the feed back. Becasue I can not build EA's it will be up to what FerruFx thinks. If he thinks it would work and wants to build this EA that is great. If that happens maybe we should start a new thread for that EA. If not that is fine as well. This EA is incredible that is being used now. Like I said in my earlier post. Was just a thought I had while going over the EA settings and loading it up on a couple of charts.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Big thank you to everyone contributing to this thread. Especially to Hugh and FerruFX for their willingness to share and help others. Been reading through the thread, definitely a strat to test. With regards to multiple TFs I wondering if the following indi would be helpful to everyone. Instead of having to switch between TFs. Thanks again, look forward to contributing further.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
as I wrote this, my luck was gone... hit SL on that usdcad...

--- 帖子 #809 ---
stops on a 5m swing have to be bigger than the 61 hence my stop on the CHF trade.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
I agree, but that gives very bar R:R. I guess 5 min tf is not good for this strategy. I should start looking at higher tf's.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
To me R:R is overrated. If you only take trades based on R:R you will miss tons of setups. I never go with R:R. Just what charts tell me.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Oh, well... that usdchf failed too... :/

* fibbotrademanager 4 in the corner of my chart with a smileface on it

* expert advisors button pressed down the symbol next to it is a green play button

* if i press F7 and check the common tab, allow live trading is verified

this has happened to me twice now, i don't understand what the problem is. please advise, thank you

Hello All,

Just joined FF but been reading and lurking for about last 2 years. Been following most of Hugh's systems, I like using fibs , and used Heiken Ashi in the past. Had a good week last using this system. This is how I have been using it.

Trading from 1 Hr , 4 Hr and Daily charts , which ever gives the signal.

The fibs I draw are as follows

On the 1 Hr chart I draw the fib of the previous day

On the 4 Hr chart the fib of previous week

On the Daily chart the fib of previous month.

I consider the signal invalid when candle closes past 75 % fib.

I also use fractals for market flow.

Hoping for another good week

Cheers

Mark

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Hello Mark, that sounds an interesting idea. How do you take the trend into account?

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Hi Hugh,

The way I account for trend is as follows, for example on 1 Hr chart, the previous day if the daily low was put in first then the high looking for up trend to continue so looking for buys, if the previous daily low taken out, ie 100 % fib take this as trend change.

Cheers

Mark

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Good one. Maybe you could post some charts here if you get a chance?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hmmm ... looks like a great idea. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hello All,

I have refined the way I trade this a bit more. Take trades from 4 hr and daily when both in agreement ie buy fibs on both 4 hr and daily, only take trades on the 1 hr that are in line with the 4 hr and daily so in this case only longs.

My current trades short on eurgbp from 4 hr

pending long on aususd from the daily

waiting for long to set up on 4 hr on gbpusd.

cheers

Mark

--- 帖子 #832 ---
I took that Trade . But Price didn't make it to any Targets, strong Trend line (Green Dashed) . . so Went out with decent pips. .  . . NEXT!

--- 帖子 #833 ---
When in comes to shorts. . .

when Price is above Day Long FIB. . Only Short when Price CLOSES below Intra Day LOW not (short). . LOW.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Trade coming up. . . which way ? which way ?

when Price closes below Day Fib short with of course Intra Fib LOW.. SHORT Trade

When Price Closes above Day Fib LONG with of course Intra FIB Long. . (0_0)

This is how i trade, no thinking, no guessing. . . just follow the rules. .

--- 帖子 #835 ---
This would be a NICE Short to take. . . If . . . it was during London hrs. . .

oh well . . . .

NEXT!!!

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Nice charts. I've been very busy doing other things recently but I still love this system.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Just took it, even though its not London HR. . .

Got the Inchy Click Finger. . .

Small position. . .

Price closed below Intra Low... Possibly headed to Pivot or T1 (Target 1) . . Stop at Daily Long Fib . .

--- 帖子 #838 ---
lets see if my Target hits. . .

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Although its not London Open yet, I took a trade. .

Price has been holding on above Intra High for couple of hrs. good sign.

I'll prob enter another position, smaller, once price closes above Day Long Fib...

Aiming for T2. Might test that Trend line again (Green Chopped Line)

Yeah. . .

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Don't forget NFP in few hours ... The price might go nowhere until then.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
True. . But I don't pay attention to Forecasts. .Not worth the time, and trouble. Just the way i Do things. I have Rules, I follow my rules. the rest, out of sight out of mind. . .

My stops protect me.. This week I've made good pips. (Past Charts). .If I loose this trade, then so be it. . I followed my Rules. and I move on to the next one. .

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Nothin for tonight. .

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Possible Trade but, I would be cautious. . I might open a SMALL position. .

chart is 1hr time frame. . and day chart. .

1hr TF - - Price has been below Day Short Fib for quite some time. . Im gonna wait till price closes below Intra short Fib. .

Day Chart - - Price has been below Monthly Short Fib for long time... and price is headed towards Weekly T-1 and T-2.. might be trying to reach that strong Uptrend (Dashed Green) just next to the Monthly Low Fib. .

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Interestingly, AUD has already played out, what the EU/US is trying to do. . .

Almost Identical, Day Chart - - Price Reached Monthly Short Fib with Weekly T-1 and T-2 Hit also with a strong Uptrend Hit (Dashed Green). .

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Possible Trade Tonight. . Got Three Charts.. One Of the Charts contradicting the other. . .

1hr - - Price Below Day Short Fib, and Closed below Intra Short. . Targeting Day T-1 . . Just Took a small Position while typing thins. .

4hr - - Price has tried to close twice before below the Weekly Long Fib and Day Short Fib but failed. waiting for 3rd attempt. . . Targeting Weekly Pivot, which is also Day T-1.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
However Weekly Chart is kinda tellin me its headed North for another test of that Trend line (Dashed Green). .

--- 帖子 #847 ---
So Far So Good. . . . I Like it , I Like it , I Like it . . . . A lot. .

Once Price hits Intra Low I'll move my Stop to break even . . Target is still at D T-1

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Just hit my stop. . Oh well . . It was fun. .  . . . as always. . . NEXT!!!!

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Got 4 Charts on CAD. . all showing the same Direction. . looks promising. .

Gonna Wait till 1H chart candle closes.. Hopefully I don't fall asleep. .

--- 帖子 #851 ---
I see No trade on any of my charts today, and most likely for this week. . All charts have hit their Targets (T-1 and T-2). CAD has Played out Very Nicely as I posted (post #852) H4 Chart. . although hasn't touched T-2 yet, but I wouldn't place a trade. .

Here's the Updated . . And No I didn't take a trade. I fell asleep, AGAIN!. . Sucks. . Oh well, like I always Say. NEXT!!. .

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Well, I waited for long time yesterday to see a close below 1.577- . .

Now I Got to wait even longer (hopefully not) to see IF Targets hit (D T-1 & D T-2), I doubt, I can stay awake tonight.. already my left eye is tellin my right eye "hey, sleep, got to sleep" . . I'll see what happens tomorrow. .

--- 帖子 #856 ---
So far So good. . I've moved my stop to 1.57666, just in case it turns back, I want to get out with at least 20 pips. .  Target is at 1.55000 which W T-2 & D T-2 Fibs are at the same spot. . Post # 857 Day chart. .. Once Price hits W T-1 I'll move my stop lower to lock in about 50 pips. . I have a feeling Weekly Target 2 (W T-2) will be hit on Friday. Thats Pacific time for me. . but I always get surprised. . . I see no other Trades for this week. . Peace Out. .

--- 帖子 #857 ---
I've moved my stop to 1.5741. Locked 50 pips. . .  Tryin to stay awake.

Hi

Love the name by the way... HughBriss... so funny.

Anyway

Years ago (about 10)  I had a system similar to this, I can't remebber where I got it from but its so similar its uncanny.  It worked really well for me for some time but I was new to FX and lost the plot and ditched it for some inexplicable reason.  hey ho that's life in this game.

Anyhow couple of points I remember from the system are...

Use a daily  chart with 14 period RSI.  Trade the fibs on 5 min chart.

Only trade in the direction of daily RSI.

RSI above 50 level only trade long and below 50 only trade short

On the 5 min chart only place fibs where the minimum pip value of an impulse of corrective wave is greater than 40pip.

I hope I haven't infringed anyone's system.. and apologies for not remembering where the original came from.

Interesting thread and great EA from FerruFX.  thank you.

CW.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
You're welcome. Great if the EA gives some help for you.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Nice thread, simple and effective ! Thanks !

Just to resume :

- Draw a fib last high/low (based on ZigZag or your eyes only)

- Wait for price to retrace to 50% level

- Set a buy stop at the 38.2 + 1pip + spread if 100MA is below price

- Set a buy stop at the 61.8 + 1pip + spread if 100MA is below price

- SL is place 1pip below 76.4 (short) or 23.6 (long)

- TP is at 100% (short) or 0% (long)

Something like that ?

Cheers,

LhDT

--- 帖子 #872 ---
That's the long and short of it. I haven't been actively trading this system for a while due to another project but I had very good results trading this way during the development. There is still some doubt about when to draw the fibs, etc but waiting for a trending situation seems a good idea. Good luck with your trading and please post charts here to help other traders following you here.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Sorry, was on holiday and missed your post. Seems like a good plan for lower timeframe traders, thanks for the input. Just an idea but couldn't you adapt that for trading hourly charts?

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Hi Guys,

I coded an indicator for that method.

Everything is in. Sell/Buy lines, 50% treshold level & TP levels.

That indicator, based on ZigZag, will plot fib lines on the chart based on the last swing.

Sometimes it happens that current (uncomplete) swing have a higher range than the previous one so this indicator will handle this and automatically draw a new fib based on the current/previous swing with the highest range (you follow me ?)

Enjoy !

LhDT.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Dear lhDT:

Hi sir here's some idea:

1. could you please add alert on it while it meet the ready to triggle level?

2. could you please make an ea then we can test which ratio will be have better winning rate? this can increase speed to test different ratio on different pair and time frame to get the finest tune on retracement level selection.

TQVM for your contribution and kind.

Best Regards:

Titan

--- 帖子 #884 ---
I personally don't like alerts but will look at it.

For the EA, yes, it's in the pipe but I'm manually test it first.

Hi,

Thanks for the indi. Questions.

Lets see the GBPUSD chart on H1 after friday closing.

Monday morning assume the price falls to 50% viz 1.5600. If it reverses from here , we set buy stop at 38.2% viz at 1.5629? and we also set buy stop at 61.8% viz 1.5570? SL for these is what ?  Current 100EMA is 1.5451 on H1.

Similarly when do we know to short ?

I am not very clear about the rules here.

regards

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Here is the last part. Hope it all makes sense. . I don't know If I can explain it better. .

As Far as having stops in case a trade reverses. . Thats on you buddy. . there is no set rule on stops, except, If you take a trade on H4, then yeah your stop is gonna be wider. . Its Subjective, based on every trade I know how much I want to risk. But I don't know how much you can risk, thats on you. .

And I'll leave you with this. . . . This Video made me think allot. .

Hi,

You had mentioned that I have plotted the Fibs wrong. But I just used the indi provided and the fibs that it plotted , my question was based on that.

So , I dont quite understand when you said that I have plotted them wrongly.

BTW... this post that I have quoted... ( which isnt there any more where you talk abt my post ) totally went above my head..... Sorry If it sounds rude, but i didnt understand the explanation on the intra day ( i know what that is ) fib and day fib and how you are going about plotting them...

PLus the auto fib plotter indi doesnt help....

So pls help !!

--- 帖子 #903 ---
No worries Simr.. it doest sound rude.. I removed my post because, after some time I noticed your post was about the indicator. . . I thought you were refering to my post. . Miss-understanding on my part. . .

ok forget the indicator.. Your brain is much more powerfull than that. .

look at my charts. you'll notice that my Intra Fibs are plotted against the Day Fib. . The day Fib is plotted with the trend. Intra Fig is plotted against the Day Fib (trend) to see wheather the trend is gonna continue or not.. . very simple

Hugh, I'm new to Forex trading, only been in about 2 weeks or so but I can see at the bottom of that pattern either a Gartley or Butterfly forming? Can anyone confirm this with me. Also where should I be putting my s/l and t/p ?

cluster : You mentioned a few days ago about the Usd/Cad hint before it pumelled downwards. Can you elaborate more for me? I don't quite understand what hint there was apart from a double top showing. Even then I doubt that was a sufficient indicator.

Many thanks to helping me with the learning curve.

Hi BossDaddy. .

First. About me when it comes to indicators.. I don't use them & I don't want to know about them.

couple of days ago I posted some pics with detailed explanations of how I trade . . I Cut them into three sections. Section1 (Post#899), Section 2 (Post#900) & Section 3 (Post#902). . And for my hint it was Post# 904. . I hope it helps, its really simple. .

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hey Cluster,

Thanks for getting back to me. You've got an interesting method of trading there. I'd just like to clarify, as I've been using Fib retracement and extension(not sure if I'm using extension right yet). When you mention Day Fib are you using the Fib retracement tool, just that you're plotting the high and lows between the start and end of each day?

Also what is an Intra Fib?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Other patterns are not relevant to this system, just watch the fibs. You find out about placing your stop loss and take profit by reading the thread. First rule of forex, read everything first before asking about something that is clearly explained in the first post.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
ok. . First. I'm using Meta Trader 4 chart. .

I got the Period Separator Option on. .

As far as naming the Fibs. You can title them however you like. I call them Day and Intra to distinguish from each. . you can name one boss, the other daddy. .

My day chart starts from a start of a new trend to the end of the trend. but updating them on every new Period. not every lower or higher price. .

Intra Fib is plotted on the One Hour chart.. BUT. Against the day Fib. meaning. . . if the trend is up. my intra fib is plotted on prices that go against the trend (which is the day fib). . and vice versa if the trend is down, Intra Fib is drawn against the trend (which is the day fib)... So what you got is, Day fib (with trend), Intra Fib (against Trend). . . Intra Fib is used to determine if the trend is goin to continue. . Pictures on post # 902 & 905, you'll see that the day fib is drawn with the trend. and Intra against the trend to see if trend will continue. and it did . . .  Sometimes it doesn't . .

But, since your new (2 weeks you mentioned)  I would start by visiting babypips.com and go to the school section. .

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Cluster: Thanks for that piece of info. I will try out your method and learn a few things from it. Yes I've been to babypips school's, went through about half the class. Its very basic examples, so I'm here on the forums to observe the applications from seasoned traders like yourself.

Hugh: Forgive me for my lack of knowledge in Forex, but I have read your first post and I am looking for clarity in using the Fibs. Also I will refrain from using other systems in the "Fib Thread" from now.

That aside, Lets take a look at the Eur/Usd for instance. According to the fib line, it the chart has crossed the 23.6 and 38.2 line, but stops midway to the 50 line.

You said we may be gearing up for big gains, why is that? I cannot see how we can determine the direction, or momentum of the chart from this alone. More info will always be greatly appreciated!

--- 帖子 #911 ---
2 possibilities. .

Trend is Bearish. . Price is Below Day Fib Short. Trend is Bearish.

When Price Closes below Intra Fib Short. I'ma take that trade, just as I did yesterday. Same Setup.

If Price closes above Intra Fib HIGH. then we have a new trend forming. . Meaning, no trade. . We wait, for another day. .

--- 帖子 #912 ---
The system is if the price reaches the 50 and then drop back below the 38.2 then you enter and put your stop behind the 61.8. If you can't look at that chart and see a pattern then you need more screen time.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Refering to my post #915

I didn't take that trade, because I fell asleep.. was too tired.

But I would have, if i was awake. I would have takin a loss of 30 pips (give or take) as price would hit my stop just above Intra Fib Long. .

But it wouldn't and shouldn't matter, it is part of trading. you win some, you loose some. I've made over 200 pips from last week. The way I look at it is, I'll pay 30 pips back for those 200+ pips. . and move on to the next one. .

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Ok, I get it now. Do you also have a take profit level? Because I'm assuming you expect the price to go way lower than the 0.0 fib level. Otherwise a stop behind the 61.8 and a t/p at 0.0 will result in a 1:1 risk:reward ratio, which I understand is not very good.

Also, this is reliant on the continuing downtrend is it not? By relying on Fibs alone, is it possible that the price may bounce off the 23.6 line and head upwards? or is this highly unlikely.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
I'm not answering most of that because it's all already in the thread. It's highly possible that anything could happen. What will happen is a complete unknowable. All I know is that given the ongoing situation in Europe and the way eurusd is trading I am interested in being short at some stage and if it goes well I could be short for a good number of days in a row.

If you follow the system exactly then you will trade in a certain way, it's all in the first post. If you trade in a different way you will still probably make money, trending markets are hard to lose in.

I always put fib level in my char but only use it as some potential level to watch. Recently out of curiosity I found if you draw fib level when price is in a range and break, most of the time price will goes to 261% lv or 423%. This spark my interest, as I am not too familiar with fib other than S&R level I will try to look what all of you do with fib here. Maybe I'll ask some question, some might be off topic but still related to fib level. Pleas bear with me, I'll be in your care.

for ferruFx, can you help me ??

the EA is quite good...

but, everyday, i make a fibo in daily, and place 3-4 stops early in the day...

-if price touch 50% place stop at 38, SL at 50 and TP 0, risk 0.5%

-if price touch 61.8% place stop at 50, SL at 61.8 and TP 0, risk 1%

-if price touch 76.4% place stop at 61.8, SL at 76.4 and TP 0, risk 1.5%

-if price touch 100% place stop at 76.4, SL at 100 and TP 0, risk 2%

cancel if price touch 123.6

with your EA, i have to set all stop in 3-4 charts... because in 1 chart, it can only handle 1 stop order.... can you give additional stop order with SL and TP maybe TP 1 and 2 for every stop order ? so that i only need to make it in 1 chart ??

hello, I woulde like to know if it is posible to have this EA doing the following:

Put 2 pending orders once the 50 is reached and buy if the 0,618  (plus some pips) is touch or sell if the 0,382 is touch. of course if one pending order executed the other one is closed, thanks!

pd: nice EA i´m trying to have some executed orders, I have fibos everywhere!

Yes, it is possible to have such an EA. Although what you have described is not enough for the EA, these are just basic rules.

Is any one still using this EA? After I udpate my MT4 the pending order, SL and TP are not respeting the fibo levels (Im almost sure) I´m using version 6. For example if I say to the EA put the SL at level 0.618 it doesn´t use that level as SL. Could some one check the EA please?

Follow up on GBPAUD. Interesting setup because IF this is the top for the sorter term run up, you can expect solid buyers where two fib levels are coming together. I highlighted them with blue. But what's more interesting to see is that the target is almost identical to the longer term swing. 2.x. I might go for it because if we get a nice test back, the risk reward would be very good on this one.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
And then we have this. GBPJPY. I took these levels for the longer term because you really have to understand that trends don't change just like that. I don't like trading GBPJPY but this is my view for it for those who trade it. Would this go back up towards the 161.8 or even 261.8? Maybe from the 50% retracement? You can always divide your trades by 3. pick first position at 61, then 50 and 38. if fails then throw them all three out. If it works you have gained even more.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Follow up on AUDCAD. Shorter term. I expect sellers to be still there in the 9980 area. for a run down to 9630 area. So if you're just a short term trader you can give it a shot to short from there with some tight stops and go for it, but be aware that I would be buying into those dips if we really get down to test those levels.

Hi Atilafx,

Nice thread and system I wonder why everyone stopped posting. Anyway if your still up for helping  others I would really appreciate if you could tell me how to access unreachable levels on my chart when fibs plot an extention there. I guess only a fib expert can help me with this thats why I am asking you. I use MT4 platform. thanks

--- 帖子 #963 ---
hi lhTD:

If it is possible, could you modify this fib tool so that the text labels are aligned to the right side of the chart.

Second wish would be if user can turn off the Text labels (SWING HIGH/LO TP1..., BUY/SELL...) and choice to turn off the prices.

So just the fib levels flushed to the right edge of the chart would make the chart visually cleaner.

Thanks you,

pax

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Awesome i recently came with the idea of making this one but you just saved me alot of work so thank you very very much. One thing, do you think it's possible to code a scanner to keep track of the fib's on all the charts? I know i know it's too much to ask but a great idea!

--- 帖子 #966 ---
I am back.

Stronger and wiser.

So I had a few accounts blowing up. But there is something I have learned from it.

Drawing Fibs is one thing but I had to figure out the best of the best way when exactly to enter.

Entering blindly on exact retracement levels with high leverage is failure over the long term. The reason is because the market does not always stop at exactly 38,50 or 61. it can go deeper against you.

So here is what I have found the best way to do it with keeping your loss at minimum but your profit up to 10x R:R.

You see, Chickening out a trade is guaranteed failure over the long term. if you have 3 trades out of 10 with a risk reward ratio of risking 1 to gain 3, then you will be a winner. But I found the risk still to much. So, believe it or not, I go back to 1 minute chart from the 1 hour to spot reversal. Sounds crazy I know but this is because I waned to limit the risk as low as possible. I rather lose 10 pips to gain 100 instead of risking 33 to gain 100.

So, let me explain.

You draw your fib. Always wait for a higher high higher low.

Once you have drawn your fibs, go back to sleep and wait for price to come back to the levels. Once they reach the 61,50,38 you switch back to the 1 minute.

And her comes the real deal. It is really simple. you know, just wait till price starts to make higher high higer low and draw a trendline. at the 3 hit, wait for a hammer from your trendline and enter the trade all the way up to the 1.618.

stop can be put 8 to 12 pips below the trendline.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
If you missed the move, don't enter now anymore, cause you can expect a pullback.

Remember, limit risk as low as possible. Don't go the same path I did before. Patience. Price will ALWAYS I repeat ALWAYS pull back.

As I said, don't ever chase price again. You will fail. fail hard as I did so many many times.

So let's wait this this pair. If we are lucky we get another pullback and even lower.

If not, then other pairs are around. Now I will post from here on whenever I enter a trade.

Just look at it. If it drifts away from this level then this has a high percentage of becoming a good winner.

Can you imagine how your account would look like if you would have chased the price as I did in the past? That would have been a recipe for disaster.

They say, buy low sell high right? Is this a buy or a sell area? The best would be if it ran away to the upside and then pull back again into the fib levels 1 more time and then go for the target.

Hi

I trade fib this way; I use the 1 hr chart to identify a fib move ie the gold chart attached where AB=CD once I am sure we have a valid retracement and new impulse(yellow circle) I will switch to the 5 to take longs, pyramiding sometimes and using fib tool to identify retracements for entry on the smaller TF. I'm sure this works on other TFs but I use these. keeps me out of bad trades keeps me inline with the trend with a solid profit target

--- 帖子 #977 ---

Why use the Fib at all, I have always found the Quartile to be far more accurate and predictive. If the price fails to break a Quartile level then it retraces to test the opposite side. Below is a bigger picture of post 961

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Interesting.

But will it also work on,lower timeframe??

And how does it work? from 25 to 125 and from 75 to 175 etc?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Hi AtillaFX...There are actually many ways to trade a Quartile and yes they can be applied to all time frames, as we say fractal.

This is your thread so I really don't want to impose here by putting in my bit. I merely wanted to show there are better alternatives than using the FIB which I haven't used for ten years or so.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Here is an example of the way I use it.

1) The inference is taken from the 30 min chart i.e. Price finds support above the water line and above the 26 EMA

2) Put Quartile on the last swing high and low on the 5 min to find the potential levels.

3) Make the entry base on the 1 min chart to keep stop at 5 pips. (rarely more)

I only trade this pair. I need to win 100 pips to double my account or lose 75 pips to wipe it out.

Note in the chart below it does not always pan out this simple, sometimes I have to make a couple of entries and sometimes it doesn't run this far in one go.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Heh that's no problem. I believe in numbers. Especially in the markets. This quartile thing deviates a bit from Fibonacci but if it is a winning strategy then why would it be a problem at all? All good ideas that have to do with numbers are welcome.

I have checked this quartile number on the British pund and found out that many times if there is a reversal price goes back to 25 max to 18 and then bounces back all the way up to 200. If others can check that to and do some research that would mean you will make a killing in short time.

Here is an example where the swing ends and bounce back to at least 200. Below an example.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Here another one. bounce from 25~18 is 200 points.

Hi AtillaFX

I had no intention of getting you excited but I can tell from your attitude and your intellect you are smarter than the average trader.

Please understand I have been trading this for many years and that adds up to a lot of experience in the development of rules and strategies.

Not the least of which is the actual placement of the Quartile when measuring distances. This has to be a logical place not just a place we make to fit in hindsight. This is how I would have it compared to your 1002 post.

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
We would now swing the Quartile from top to bottom because we have a bullish divergence and can pretty guess we have reached the bottom because we have made two Quartiles. Then we see the bulls find support above the waterline and above the EMA so from this point we are all the time long on any trades we take. Notice then that when it reached the 50% level it was in a bearish divergence and this would have been an exit (380 pips)

Anyway the point is we have to put the Quartile on the correct swings including the wicks.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
Thank you for explaining. Sounds really like a good winner.

On average out of 10 trades, how many time do you get stopped out? Cause 5 pips stop is really nice for RR.

Any skype room?

I close all trades out for the weekend.

So re entered USDJPY long.

Adjust the TP target for now. Not the most ideal target but for the short term.

Here was my last week entry

After some more research, these green stripes would be the BEST possible places to enter longs with stops just 10 pips below the orange line.

I expect bounce from these green stripes. Just watch :-)

Hi AtillaFx

Not sure about your 1 min EJ above where you ask why did you take it.

Here is my take on that pair though I don't trade it (I stick to one pair only i.e. Aud/Jpy)

See how nicely the Quartile picks the target distance from the range at the top.

See how my entry would have been much earlier than yours with a target of the 25% quartile.

Then I got a short signal which would have made me exit.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Yeh, well it looked good to me.

Stopped out on all trades.

Lucky me I closed the GBPAUD long trade yesterday.

Waiting now for price to develop.

What is your exact strategy that you use to trade? What time frame do you draw your fibs on etc..good job so far!

Fibs can be very accurate when used correctly in a strategy...trying to figure all this out.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Update for USDJPY on 26.1.18

Price retraced and hit my stop loss, realized profit of $14.19. Lesson learnt, maybe my stop loss could have placed on the further resistance level to allow the noises to pass. But still happy as I've profited!

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Hello Akolva, good day to you! For me, I would draw my fibs on 4h and 1d chart. I only take trades if there is a small trend forming, i.e. (at least 2 higher highs and 2 higher lows OR at least 2 lower highs and 2 lower lows). The level drawn will be subjective, but i always draw them from the lowest point to the highest point of the trend. As long as there are reversal candles appearing on the fib levels (which also coincides with support/resistance level), i will enter trade! Of course I'm still learning in the progress as I just started trading live by myself earlier this month.

How about you? How do you use this strategy?

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
I'm just trying to find a profitable way of using fibs as I know they can be quite accurate when used correctly. Seeing that you have profited from using fibs was wondering how you used them. I'm going to try your strategy next week and backrest this weekend. Thanks for the reply!

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Yup sure. Feel free to drop me a PM or over here so that others who are lurking around can learn too  All the best to you! Hope to hear from you soon!

This thread seems to have gone quiet but a question for all the fibo traders out there.

Has anyone tested or have stats on which fibo retracement  level is more successful in returning price to its original trend?

Hello,

Instead of the EA indicator right at the beginning of this thread, could we not just have the indicator placed on our charts to see the Fib levels and be able to place the buy/sell trades ourselves.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
The EA is semi automatic. It means that you need to manually set up the fib levels on mt4. After you set up the fib level you have to rename the name to BUY or SELL. After this you can use the EA. So for manually trading you set up the fib level in the same way: If price reach 50 level you set up an pending order at 38 level.

Hello davia75,

Are you asking where to find the Fibonacci drawing tool?

Thanks

Attached Image

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
Hello, I've customized my MT4 Fibonacci Retracement drawing tool to draw S/R lines. This means I'm unable to easily apply Fib retracement lines on my charts when I wish to, that is without deleting my custom setup. I've looked and failed to fine a Fib retracement indi that works in the same way as the Mt4 drawing tool. That is, one that allows me to manually draw the lines. All the ones that I've found out there automatically draw them (an advantage I suppose to everyone by myself). DOES ANYONE HAVE A MANUAL FIB RETRACEMENT INDI THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH ME? I'd be very grateful. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
Partial clumsy solution, better than re-editing Fibonacci tool properties, every F-OREX time.

1) Open up a Monthly chart, e.g.; EURUSD MN1

2) Draw each Fibonacci tool you wish to save the settings for (Retracement, Expansion line, Fan line, Time zones).

3) If you want two or more Fibonacci retracement tool settings saved, draw each or however many.

Select anyone of those drawn Fibonacci retracement tools, right-click to Edit Properties, click the Fib Levels tab, then click the OK button (same procedure for Common tab: Line Color/Style/Width, and Parameter tab: Ray): Whatever settings were saved in that Fibonacci tool will reappear once again when drawing.

Now, save the Fibonacci completed chart as a template, e.g. FibSettings-EURUSD-MN1.tpl

So, you don't forget time frame and pair.

Also, use MN1, because it slowly changes and moves.

To view the example file attachment, open up a EURUSD MN1 chart, and apply template.

Hi,

I am looking for indicator which can show me result as shown in picture. Fib extension from Point A to Point B and retrace to Point C and show or project future Profit target 61.8 AND 100.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
Biggest problem appears to be when to draw the Fib.

Pick a day, say Friday.

Use the Fib Tool.

Use whatever %s work.

See if a year of Fridays works.

Figure your own SL and TP.

Use the EA by FerruFX .... wonderful job, very professional.

Daily Line Boxes by Hannover.

Huge, well done.

Regards and be well,

BD

Moved the grid up with the same size/length as the first one.

Fib Tool only allows so many line.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Is the EUR/USD getting ready to decline?

Blue lines = trades or future trades

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
EUR/USD did drop.

Screen Shot shows the entire week based on previous Friday.

Note the grid provided how the entire week could be traded.

I don't initiate trades on Friday after midnight.

Good luck in your trading.
