Hi dimdel, Looks interesting. I will test this out in about a week or 2, need to get my system up and running. Thanks for sharing. Anyone try to automate this, make dashboard for all currencies, or setup some type of arrows. Thanks, will be following.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Dimdel, Thanks for sharing your idea. CHF-JPY hit the target TP yesterday. I know you don't trade that one, but just FYI. So far, all the other closed trades I placed with your system were profitable.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I understand that your use MTF HA to show your monthly HA. For your daily candles, are those HA as well? Did you change the settings? Do you have a template by chance? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
hi gdi the HA daily is default cant change parameters

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Example. Taday is the eur/nzd. Combination of the day. Trust me. Some people know about this that why they charge uneqaul spread for this kind of combinstion to distract people from it. Trust me.

its a good system，i do the same thing for 5 years，the only one thing is how to exit for the user，the weekly ppz is very important ！

--- 帖子 #43 ---
HI LUCA how exit ? you mean where exit ok well i think that less RR from 1/1 is no sense to trade so i use TP the same pips with SL or you can use fibo

Hi Dimdel , very interesting method, thanks for sharing. I've got some questions, as i saw in your screen shots, your sl and tp is different from the first page as you explained and some of your closed have been closed manually and also some of them hasn't got any sl and tp . may i know your reason for them? and also may i know the percentage indicator which you use for tp and sl indication? thanks in advance and more green pips to you.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
hi kasrafx nothing change from initial rules so if i have not tp/sl = i forgot it ( i am testing 4 system x 24 pairs) if i close manually , i dont no why , just i am positive and exit in any case the rules are the same the percentage indi is the fibo ( i changed the parametres) thanks

Hi Dimdel, Can this strategy apply to opening of Monday candle? Because usually there will be some of the pairings will open with a "gap" on Monday after market closing at weekend.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
if you have signal at friday night 23,30 then you can put order the opposite gap is part of the game but the point is how much % profit we can make a week loses will be in any system thanks

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Dimdel, I backtested your system last week and I think it is a very profitable system. Thanks for sharing your system to everyone right here! I will try this system out on this week!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
hi kevin demo first please thanks

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hello dimdel I have been following both your methods from the start; in your experience so far, which way are you more inclined: green/red on 6 pairs or best close on 24 pairs? As for myself, I am more inclined towards green/red, but of course you have carried out a much more detailed test of both strategies and would know better than me

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hi howard both system can give good results MM is most important from strategy

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I see many ppl reading this thread. Don't be scared. Go test and share Your results. This strat works very well till now.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
To all the peeps who are trying out this method, Do you always make the trade to break-even to protect you from the loss? From what I observed from the history, it might goes against your direction before it hits TP. How you all see this? Correct me if I'm wrong!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I never move my SL to BE because i trigger my trade and look at my chart after 24 hours. Remember, 10 minutes with charts and do what You have to do.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
hi kelvin there is no system with 100% profit to all orders if you lose a few orders is part of the game i dont use BE price will go to SL or TP i want RR 1/1, so if the win&gt;lose then we are winners

i dont see any signal for tonight

Hi, I have made EA base on this one but using HA_Smooth instead. Open 2 orders each currency. 6 parameters to display index1, index2, index3 , index4, high and low. Index is to detemine the candle is red or white, if white then index1&lt;index2 , index3&lt;index4. Index1,2 is monthly and 3,4 is daily Stop loss if buy then low take profit = low + 50 pips and reverse with sell. Here some result I made last night show some promising. Test it and see what you think Put heiken_aishi to indicator folder if you not have it yet. EA to expert folder.

Hi Phemmy, how you doing , long time no see you

hi kongminh thanks for your EA i will try it do you have include the open/clse rule? i mean short=all red but signal if close &gt;open? thanks

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Not yet dimdel, still haven't touch that yet. Also the take profit somehow still need to be fix, stop loss is okay at high and condition 50 pips. Still I'm not get quite the close &gt; open thing. Hope you explain in detail that.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
hi kong if isnt valid these rules , then cant test your EA bzc isnt the same strategy thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Today I put orders following this strategy on AUD CHF, AUD JPY, CAD CHF, CAD JPY, EUR AUD, EUR CAD, EUR GBP, EUR NZD, GBP AUD, GBP NZD, NZD CHF, NZD JPY, USD CAD and USD JPY. Let's see what will happen, hehehehe...

I'm running my EA on a fresh account from start and will update each evening how the trades have done, only thing I'm scaling into the trades rather than just entering and no one stop and take profit fits all. Stop and Take is calculated on the ADR for each pair. Asw

hi esw my EA Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I assume that's a back test? The EA has closed 2 trades in profit, GBPNZD, entry was: 2.3828 and EURNZD, entry was: 1.74003, both were long trades, I have a AUDCAD rolling still entry was: 0.9456 and that was a short trade. Asw

--- 帖子 #131 ---
hi asw well your EA is only for sell right? so post some backtest and if someone want to buy it, its ok can PM to you no sense to show something without share it thanks my friend

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi dimpel, When I refer to a trade, I always refer to a LONG trade. I don't back test, back testing is a nonsense and means nothing. No I'm not trying to sell my EA, I'm just giving the results of your strategy and they are looking quite good using my scaling in method. I've modified the entry slightly to try confirm a turning point back into the MN1, D1 trend. I've added a setting to confirm the pullback is more than a dynamically calculated number of pips based on the ADR for each pair and another setting to confirm the close of the current bar is higher than the open by a dynamically calculated number of pips based on the ADR. Asw

Hi, Why did you use less lots for those negative trades? What made you do that? Can you tell me how to read the Japanese candle? How can you find high low in those handles? Some of the candle is drawn with thick lines , other parts with thin line... What does that mean? ln

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Dimdel first of all thanks for sharing this strategy I believe this is not an EA As i 'm not fluent in english and newbie, could you or any body elaborate the rule to buy /sell because I can''t follow it (when to buy/sell, tp&amp; sl) Thanks before

--- 帖子 #146 ---
example to avoid generally i prefer trade 7-10 ( my time) and if iwin then stop, or if i lose then i try again at 15-18 ok A = 7-10 win B = no trade area ( but i trade) C = no need to trade becausee 7-10 was win, but i trade D = dont trade before or after the news , but i trade so -- i write all these to see with which way can lose , if you dont know it -- stick to the your rules Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Dimdel....i have a question for this 'fuga' system: We look for price to make a new high or low, and based on the new printed high/low we measure with fibo the distance between breakout level and the new high/low , and we put pending order at 100 level? with SL@ Zero level and TP @ 200 level? In your last picture you had a short (pending) because we had a new high printed, right?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Aren't we trying to short on a possible support this way ?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Yes, indeed, but if we take into consideration 'a range market structure' - when a new high is made market will seek liquidity in to the other way of the range....that could work, as i saw that on M1 chart, Sl and TP will not be more than 20-25 pips.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
hi fxentropy i look for new high/low if the distance is 18 pips min then i put short/long pending this order is valid if the price break the entry directly without any zigzag angles

OK guys, I am here, answering the call. Unfortunately, I am lost in the system rules. Signal Long/Short Entry Buy/Sell SL/TP The beach here is awful, so I am just going home

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hey maestro: here are the rules (maybe dimdel can confirm if all OK with these) Regardless of timeframe (although we trade M1), let's say that market make a new LOW. Then we put Fibo from the new created low to last low that zigzag created , and thats how we find our entry point + 5 pips. ENTRY +5 pips room will save a lot of fake signals actually... (zigzag set is 21 5 3 ) Take profit is minimum 1:1 with risk....but from my observations can go as high as Risk Reward 1:5 easy!! Dimdel however created another rule, saying that if the market do too much zigzags before reach the entry point then the entry would not be valid anymore. I guess we can filter that as in time....if a order is not filled in 30 mins we delete it. In below examples we have a SL 15 pips with a doable TP of 50 pips (even 80 pips)

Thanks Fxentropy, I got it. Just to confirm: New High or New Low should be confirmed by zigzag or not necessary ? Is there a minimum distance between New High and Previuos High (depending on the TF of course) ?? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hi abokwaik --yes ,the min distance must be 18 pips if is less , no pending --the zigzag 21/5/3 give the H/L is repainting but the 21 keep the leg if you have other idea please tell me --the order will put it ,if the price go directly to the previus H/L without other angles -- the order count the SL/TP when will active

Attached File(s) 3ma's.tpl 36 KB | 333 downloads Adding nothing new here, just a reminder of a simple and working method when followed with consistency and discipline. Long only: MA1&gt;MA2&gt;MA3 | close when price closes above MA1 Short only: MA1&lt;MA2&lt;MA3 | close when price closes below MA1 In both cases the trader scales-in when a signal candle appears, closes all as mentioned above. MA's choice is upon trader's discretion, e.g. MA1 can be 10EMA, MA2 can be 20SMA, MA3 can be 200SMA (classic) 9 entries below, 7 of them could be profitable. NOTE: 1 minute chart attached. At least once a day there is a trend like this in at least on pair of the, let's say, 3 that are being watched. That is enough. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
HI realtruth go on if work for you its ok but in range market many false signals ..no ?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi dimdel, that's the reason for the note added in the post. The timeframe is so low that 20-25 pips trends happen everyday, often more than once. Especially in high volatility pairs. So if someone chooses 2-3 of such pairs it is easy to make 10-15 pips a day. These pips are enough to be profitable. Simple strategies are the best as they can be applied consistently. The more complicated a strategy is the more often fails to be applied consistently. Consistency is the other key (patience is the first one)

hi liunliun well your chart is right the zig zag must have diff parametres for each timeframe the zig zag sometimes repaint, but its ok the green red is another system this is the "fuga" but who cares about the names? all we want a good system no a good name dimdel

--- 帖子 #304 ---
hi dimdel ,thanks again ,and can u tell me ,whether "fuga" or "best close" is better? which system is used in ur main trades? i see every post of u ,i think u are a great trader. and i m coding for the system"fuga" now when i finish i ll update it thank u for sharing again.thanks.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
the system is the 30% of the good trader anyway dont have problems with names etc dont expect the best system stay in one system if you have a system with 90% loses and 10% win, then this is good system at the end just trade opposite

If I understand properly, to define a long set up price must be lower than last lower fractal. If Low[1]&gt;Low[2] we have a potential stop in the bear wave, so we place a buy stop order @ lower fractal (100 level), stop @ the bottom of the bear wave, and 1:1 risk reward. The opposite to go short. Correct?

Thanks Dimdel, Trade that got entered yesterday on EURAUD 4 hr chart. I know the TG level is not 1:1 though. This is a mix up of different indicators from other strategies I am trying so please disregard them. I just added the ZZ to the chart. Is it correct as there are multiple candles not touching the entry level before actually entering the position? Thanks

Hello Dimdel, I am reviewing your system carefully. As with most good systems, it is not complicated. I have time for H4 and D1 so this ideal for me. I am doing my due diligence and find this to be a net winner for sure. Looking forward to placing some trades next week. Of course, I am also checking over possible filters. Your continued use of red/green tells us a lot after so much time. Thanks for sharing. I'll try to put up some charts next week. Best regards.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Yeah the most important thing is to filter good signals

--- 帖子 #429 ---
hi -i think nude chart is better many filters less signals but if work for you its ok -the only safe way is the MM x 2 ( money and mind managment) example - 2 persons win 5% each a month with 3% risk , ( i think its ok) the 1st have 100.000$ and the second 500$, i think the second after 1 month will risk 40% and this is the end...... that is the game

Thank yo for the the great thread. All the people are looking only for great entry. Bit great exit is more than 50% of success. I think it is 90% ) But please tell me how to use zigzag for closing since it repaint? May be I'm missing something? I prefer to close (or set sl in BE) on reverse candle (when bear candle high is highest today, and bull low lowest) or/and on stoch oversold/overbought (can be rsi or whatever).

hi yes ,zigzag repaint but repaint only the curent leg no repaint the angle so no problem to this strategy also you can use trsl to 161 fibo , its more safe

Hi dimdel, Interesting ingenious trading approach and fantastic to see your longevity and persistence . Just starting to try it out. Wonder if say a 200 ema might provide a filter with a return to the mean type approach? Or whether it is better to just trade it as you have successfully presented it without any additional indicators/filters and as such biases. Cheers

Hi dimdel , Thank you for sharing your system. your thread is very light , simple , straight forward and elegant. I read it all in one session. hope to try your ideas next week. seems to be ok , I will scan all the market watch ( automatically ) , to check all possible entries and check percentage of winning positions. I will try different TimeFrames to find the best one , I prefere smaller to have more positions, lets see how thing go. thanx again

Dear Dimdel This picture is from your post 1. just to make sure I got it right, do you mean that this is valid entry as we have one candle does not cross the entry level? regards,

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Dear Dimdel, again This picture from post 1. here , you are saying we don't have free candle. can you elaborate more on this , what do you mean by free candle , is it candle that have high less than entry level / or lower upper entry level ? regards,,

--- 帖子 #500 ---
hi Dimdel , what do you want to say here ?? if we have high then HH we expect to go short next , here why you are taking long position while we don't have LL after Low ? regards,

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Dimdel , in this picture , I am confused for two things , level 0 -- 100 should be drawn between the two highs , or two lows , so I adjust them on the left setup for buy positon , is my understanding correct , second thing the entry level for buy position should be the higher low , you are saying this is the entry level for both positions? please clarify if my understanding is wrong Regards, #

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi Dimdel , sorry for too many questions but I need to understand your strategy 100%. in this picture , do you mean we can apply the strategy between any two highs provided is the new High is higher than previous high and they should not be immediately following each other? in the picture I see you apply it between 1 and 2 in the picture please confirm regards,

--- 帖子 #328 ---
hello Dimdel, here I am lost , is it same strategy , I see arrow down ( sell ) where I expect buy , can you give them numbers and check for each one how decision was made ? may be there is overlapping I added a picture at which I gave numbers for each position and a number for each vertix ( high or low ) , can you please tell for each position what at the vertices included in the decision to make sell or buy ? regards,

hi omaramir look the icon there are 2 ways to trade with zigzag 1) followin the trend 2) reverse the trend

--- 帖子 #330 ---
so your strategy is both directions : when we have low then LL , and price goes up fibo 100 you buy , but if price go down below fib 0 you sell ? this what you mean ?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
in any case 0% = SL 100%= entry 200%= TP

--- 帖子 #332 ---
This is clear , but I understand from the post 156 and next and from post 1 , you are trading against the trend. to trade with the zigzag trend , this is new I discovered late or you updated/improved your strategy recently Regards,

--- 帖子 #333 ---
ok let me clear the things 1.here I share some subscription ideas, 2.please don't follow my trading profile or strategy 3.you get any strategy and if it works, then you adapt it to you 4. if you read carefully you will get the way.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
OK , Thank you , very clear , thanks for sharing everything.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
dimdel, the 161 fib is a good first target, taking 1/2 position off at 161 and letting other 1/2 run with trailing stop. exits are always the hardest part in any trade.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
hi excactly the MM is sometimes more important than following strategy

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I dimdel, which kind of setup do you use on D1 time frame? 3,2,2 or different? Thank you

--- 帖子 #338 ---
hi Alberto 3,2,2
