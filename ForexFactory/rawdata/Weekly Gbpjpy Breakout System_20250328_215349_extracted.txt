hi all...i've been working on a weekly breakout system for a while...just finished 1 year manual backtest so i can share it now... basically we are taking last 2 candle's on 4 hour chart of the previous week as a breakout boundary.. entry at the break either way... stop loss at the out of break out target profit 2x stop loss... when the price hits stop loss in a way our we increase target profit x3 stop loss in opposite direction... no trailing stop... trade ends with sl -tp or end of the week... 1 year result is monthly average 714 pips... spreadsheet and chart attached.... good luck --------------------- Optimization from Bigricky --------------------- HI guys, Have been following this system with great interest. I am relatively new to forex and am looking for a mechanical type system. I have spent most of the weekend backtesting this system and although the results looked promising to start with when I applied the system and stepped through every trade it unfortunately doesn't look to good for the way I would trade it over the 2005 and 2006 years. Before I go on I just want to say I am new to this and there is always the possibility that my backtesting is flawed in some way. I have attached my spreadsheet and MT4 template to show the setups for each trade. I trialed 2 systems side by side. I have used harolds rules. System 1 - Take profit at 1x channel. Use the 2 bar, then back to 3 bar. If channel less than 100pips. Make a 100 pip channel. Add 7 pips on to upper level of channel (allowance for spread). Buy and sell stop orders placed 3 pips outside of upper and lower channel lines to allow for channel to be actually broken before entry. Stop levels also set at 3 pips outside of channel again to allow for channel to actually be broken before being stopped out. Take profit at 1x channel band. Gaps - Ignore smaller gags - less than 20 pips.) For larger gaps If gap is filled within the channel trade as per normal. If it gaps outside of channel, don't take the trade. If price returns to channel and closes gap, trade as per normal. (I actually backtested ignoring gaps vs waiting for them to close and it didn't really make much difference to the bottom line) If the first trade is successful then thats it for the week. If the first trade fails, Take a trade in the opposite direction if triggered. System 2 - Take profit at 2x channel. Same as above but take profit at 2 x channel band. Risk Risk is 1% of account on each trade ( compounded). I see the system profitability is sometimes measured in pips instead of return on account. I'm still trying to figure out how that accurately measures profitability. (I'm still a newbie, remember). For me I will only risk a set % per trade. Whether the channel is 100 pips wide or 400 pips wide it will still be 1% risk. This means that some pips will be worth $1 (100pip chan) or 25 cents (400 pip chan). Again, if I am missing something here I would appreciate more experienced people pointing me in the right direction. I have also subtracted 5% off of the winning trades. This is to allow for the 3 pip buffer on either side of the channel. (probably more like 3% but I like to allow for the worst case scenario) RESULTS System 1 - Take profit at 1x channel. 2005 - 7.95% return on account 2006 - 9.62% return on account System 2 - Take profit at 2x channel. 2005 - 8.78% return on account 2006 - 2.04% return on account 2007 (2% risk per trade - compounded) 1x chan T/P (2nd trade 1x) 46.09% 2x chan T/P (2nd trade 2x) 65.21% 2x chan T/P (2nd trade 3x) 47.16%

Do you have some statistics for2-3 years (different markets volatilite)? Best Regards, Marcelo Marques

Liked the idea. Just a few questions - You get the Friday's last 2 4hr candles as high/low parameters, is that right? - In this case, what is the open/close hours of your last 4hr candle? I'm asking because I use IBFX and the last 4hr candle opens 20:00 GMT (3pm EST) but closes just 1 hour after (broker closure for the weekend). Maybe I should use the 16:00GMT as the last full 4hr candle. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
It looks like he is using IBFX, also. Look at the high and low on the chart he posted. They match IBFX.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thank you for sharing this hard work - certainly is an amazing equity curve! And although no trailing stop is easy to do in backtesting (emotionally and mathematically) I wouldn't leave a trade like today's open for a potential loss. It's so far in profit right now but still far from t/p that I'd try to lock in a little profit at least. I couldn't watch a trade like this go into the red. Will be looking at this method more closely for sure. Cheers Michael

Extreme volatility in 2007 for GBPJPY.... you will find GBPJPY much less volatile in prior years.... use a D1 chart in MT4.... Risky strategy, but nice in hindsight. I'd like to see 2006 myself. Otherwise, possibly a fluke.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
When do you place your orders? London open on monday? or Asian open? I'm wondering what you do if your broker is still on weekend spreads .

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thx for sharing but stoploss will be too big regards

--- 帖子 #9 ---
i have done a manual backtest for year 2005 ihave altered his plan just a bit i use the same 2 candles on north finance charts if they didnt total 100 pips i would go to 3rd candle to increase range and it that didnt do it i would equally add the difference to top and bottom. my target and stop is the size of the range not double max trades for the week is 2 they only happen if 1st stop is hit here are the results 5 weeks we broke even where stop was hit but reversal won. the rest are 36 wins for 3600 and 14 losses for 1400 total pips for 2005 2200 this is significant since the market was a lot differnt and not as volitile many systems crashed during this year 2006 was also tough but only for half of year so when i get time i will check it out this could be a nice set and forget for me

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi, thanks for sharing. I will try to backtest this system for longer period. My question is what happens in such a case ( please see the chart) . Will the system generate 5 x Stop ? Regards

--- 帖子 #11 ---
i dont know what you mean my post is a variation of his so i would only put on 2 trades max no double upa 1:1 risk

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Harold4x, I assume you also made the last 2 bars = 100 if they were &gt; 100 ? So the channel was always 100 ?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
yes the results for 2006 werent as good as 2005 but acceptable 1300 2007 was 4100 so the rcap 183 pips a month for 2005 108 a month 2006 and 343 for 2007 2005 and 2006 were very tough markets so to find something that has profit during that time is something to look at

--- 帖子 #14 ---
That's what I was thinking. The fact is most trend following systems on the GBP/JPY for 2007 did very very well. And decently for 2006. Try a year on the 4 hr. or daily time frame for the year of 2004 and that would be a challenge to see if it did well that ranging year. 2005 was a lousy year for this pair too. 2007 was a good year for trend following systems. Paris

--- 帖子 #15 ---
paris look at post just above yours for results for 2005 and 2996 with a little variation from the original method

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Perhaps now that more and more traders are coming into forex ,this will make the markets more volatile for this pair from now on. Lots more traders putting their money into the market. Do you think EUR/USD and GBP/USD has more volatility year after year and we should be concentrating on those instead of GBP/JPY? Paris

Hi nomask, Great system, so easy and profitable. I have a question. Why you dont trade 26/03/07 to 30/03/07, 16/04/07 to 20/04/07, 10/09/07 to 14/09/07 and 17/09/07 to 21/09/07 ?. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Harold4X - thanks for this post. What was your rationale for the particular changes you made, ie. did you settle on these after trying various other combos, or is this a general formula that suits your style ? Tks also to nomask for this thread. J.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
sorry guys i've been off for some works these days..my chart is fxdd and sure you can optimize this strategy through your own trading style but all i can say is this one is a profitable method..

--- 帖子 #20 ---
probably these are the breakeven or zero profit trades..need to check it again..

--- 帖子 #21 ---
reason i altered was to reduce risk trying to get twice as much is hard so 1:1 reward was my way to go and results proved good

--- 帖子 #22 ---
that also makes sense...more conservative way to trade the method

--- 帖子 #23 ---
nomask and harold4x, In your testing, if the TP was hit on one side first , did you keep the other trade on in case the price reversed or did you remove the other trade and call it a week? Thanks, Glen

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Interesting system. Nice to try with micro lot first for few weeks. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I wanted to bump this to let everyone see it again. It hasn't received the attention it deserves. I've had about 5 straight winning weeks with this using harlod's rules. I made another 120 pips this morning.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Me Too Bill It Is Kind Of Nice Isnt It

--- 帖子 #27 ---
thanks for the bump. i am checking it out. NoMasks other systems are winners also.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
by the way bill the backtest for 2006 was a +1300 not bad for a tough year but 2007 saw an increase to +4100

--- 帖子 #29 ---
That's good to know, harold. I know it's been making money for me.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Bill, Congrats on the 120 pips this morning. What's your criteria to enter another trade or are you still in this morning's trade with a trailing stop loss? Do you enter more than 1 trade per week? Thanks, Phil

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I do it as harold outlined and using the method he used in his backtesting. On Sunday evening, I place both a buy stop order and a sell stop order. If one of them gets hit, I ride it out until I either hit the PT or SL. I don't replace it. If it hits the SL, that automatically puts me in the opposite trade. - If I was long, it puts me short and vice versa. I ride that trade out until SL or TP. If I'm in a trade, I close it out Friday evening before my broker closes. I only take 2 trades a week. The second trade only occurs, if I get stopped out on my first trade. If I hit the PT on the first trade, I cancel the other order.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thanks for Reply Bill, So last 2 candles of last week had a 121 pip range on IBFX charts. High candle 211.10 + 9pip spread = 211.19. I take it that 212.40 would be your TP target which you obviously reached so now you're done for the week with this system? Is this correct? Thanks again, Phil

--- 帖子 #33 ---
But what are the hours of bars 4h?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes, I'm done for the week. I hit the PT this morning. I don't use IBFX to check Friday's candles, although I place the trades on IBFX. I use a North Finance demo as harold suggested. The Friday candles are different on the two. They begin at different times and end at different times and usually have different values.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Download a North Finance demo. Use it's last two Friday bars.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hey Bill, That clarifies everything up for me! Hope your Mom is fully recovered from her fall this past winter and is enjoying good health. Take Care, Phil

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Mom's fully recovered and is doing fine. Thank you for asking.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
bill although i used nf to do backtests it really doesnt matter which platform you use the high and lows will be about the same also if there is a gap like yesterday i waited till a 4 hr candle closed within the high low range before i put my straddle on

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I did the same thing yesterday. I didn't figure it mattered which data feed one used. It may matter with IBFX though. They close earlier on Friday than most others. Their last 4H candle is a short one.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
sometimes nf data is screwed up i use my own platform from rjofx what has impressed me is the profit in 2005 and 2006 last year shows the robustness when markets get wide ranges i think this little strategy out performs that other gbpjpy 8 hr deal by a lot

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I think you may be right. It looks good.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hello. Thanks, it is a interesting system. With FXCM data, using high and low from Friday 8:00 EST to Friday 15:00 EST, simulating from January 17, 2005 to February 13, 2008, it makes 2360 pips. Before 2005, from 2001 to 2005, risking max 10% per trade, it doesn't work. I also close positions when reaching stop_loss or limit or Friday at 15:00 EST. Regards. Paco.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
paco i think you are using wrong times my broker closes 5 pm on friday est so if you look on 1 hr chart its 10am till 5 but just take last 2 4 hour candles and check to see if data is about the same as other brokers. your findins are much different than mine 2200 pips for 2005 1300 pips for 2006 and 4100 pips for 2007 i did this manually so there are no errors

--- 帖子 #44 ---
OK. Then, If I take from 9 EST until close, I also obtain 4058 pips in 2007. If i take from 10 EST until close, I obtain 3695 pips in 2007. Then, I think last two bars are from 9:00EST to 13:00EST (4 hours) and from 13:00EST to 17:00EST (4 hours). I'm going to test with other pairs such as GBP/USD. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hello there. Nice system.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Harold, How does Daylight Savings Time effect MT4 charts when going back years?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
It depends on the broker providing the data feed. With some, the time remains constant. With others it changes with DST.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
bill, have you done a manual backtest of weeks where you had to enter a second trade because the first one got stopped out? if so, what is the winning percentage of the second trades? thanks, greg

--- 帖子 #49 ---
harold, you broke even 5 weeks on stops and reverses for profit. can you tell us how many times you had double losses from when the second trade also stopped out? thanks, greg

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Had a look at other pairs such as GU, EU. The pattern doesn't seem exist there.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Due to a network error, you all have been saved from one of my novels. God was sending me a message for sure. So let me make it simpler... I think this little channel has some power through the rest of the week. A cursory check indicates if we make a target one way or the other, there is a reasonably high probability of some payout if price reverses to our entry point. If it gets back to that point the last couple of weeks it either immediately or eventually continued on to the opposite original entry. This week was an easy winner, last week would have been a challange. I think there is more low hanging fruit here if we were to take the time to work on it. More time is NOT what I have. I am tossing this out for someone to look at if they have an interest. Might be total bunk after looking at more data... I don't know. Just tossing out something I saw. Love what I see with this though. Okay, okay... I'll shut up now....

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Wow, I must have had too many beers the first time I read this method. I really got this wrong, and I am glad I looked over the rules again. I like the idea of adding an extra 4 hours to this if the price for the original breakout box doesn't equal 100 pips. And it seems to work reasonably well in the case where that occurs. I also agree with the concept of adding pips to each side of the box if after adding the additional hours the price still doesn't amount to 100 pips. I still notice a large percentage of the cases I looked at had the situation where if the price goes to half the target (as determined by the high/low of the box) that you can make pips from the fact price will tend, eventually to retrace to trigger the opposite side of the box. I have to look at this more closely to figure the possible money management rules for this. The bigger concern I have is, what to do about these gap opens. Today was pretty big. In the discussion to date it looks like the concensus view is, we should place a limit order and wait for price to come back and trigger. I think this is reasonable when the gap it smallish... 50 pips more or less. But for these really significant ones, maybe it would be better to wait for price to break back into the range by some percentage and only then reestablish the stop order. So, for example, today the Market open showed a gap of 102 pips from the breakout box low to the open of the first candle. In such extreme cases it might be wiser to wait for the price to retrace 1/4 or 1/3 of the total box height. Again, in this case, breakout box height is 117 pips, so 1/4 would be 29 pips. So we might decide to wait for price to return (102+29=) 131 pips from the open before putting on the sell stop. I've seen where the retrace on these big days has a way of just continuing on. Also, I am trying out another twist. Because from the open, price continued on to exceed the 117 pips, and I believe there is a phenomenon of price traveling the height of the breakout box once it reaches this point and retraces across the trigger price, I am placing a half lot position to try to benefit from this. I'm still deciding how best to handle the gap. I'd love to here what Nomask thinks since you've analyzed these weeks more closely in your spreadsheet work. I really like this system. I'm a bit surprised there hasn't been more discussion on this thread. I'm happy you folks bumped it so that I found it. This week could be a challange though, so we'll see if it works despite the gap, and which way it will run. Nomask, thank you again for sharing this.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Nomask or anyone here, Please show the buy stop and sell stop figure for this week based on last friday bars? I just want to confirm my understanding on this technique. A chart would greatly help me. I would appreciate it Thanks.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Fxhaz, I only have a moment so can't post a chart. But the high was 207.39 and the low was 206.22. These are my broker's numbers on IBFX. Yours might be different. Figure from 1400 GMT to the close GMT (2059). We had a huge gap open on Sunday that has not yet closed. In the discussion in the thread we stated you would wait until price closed the gap to initiate a position on that side, which this week would be a Sell Limit. I think there could be some improvement over this "no brainer" way of handling a gap. I'll be looking into it when I get a chance.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
hey qman..... got your mail..... this is very similar to a 3 line break system, i've coded that long ago...... did a quick read and if i understand the rules correctly, gaps are probably going to whack us around here..... nomask's simple and well defined rules should make turning his thoughts into an ea fairly simple..... with a couple extra options we could compare different entry times, ie sunday's open might not be the best...... h

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hayseed, thanks for looking in... And, AaaaHaaa!, ... Good thinking! Way to think outside the box! Literally. Three line break? Hmmm. Sounds familiar. I must have seen that around and never jumped in. Did you develop an indicator to go with that? I've been looking back here and there and I think there are several opportunities/methods for trading in and around this channel. I really misread the rules the first time through. I somehow thought the plan was take profit a 1X the distance of the channel, and if that fails, then your goal becomes 2X on the next entry. That kills profit obviously, but the reliability of the second cross was of note. --- I guess if I was smarter I might have realized that points to the possibility of a better entry time. I also noted a high propensity for price to move all the way through a modification of the channel once the first 1X (remember, that was my mistake) TP was hit. If price goes to the 1X point and reverses to your original entry price trigger, it tends to eventually go to the other end of the channel. Sometimes it meanders there, sometimes direct, sometimes it will give you a scare, but it gets there far more often than it doesn't. This look at it needs some work though. If we can get a "simple indicator that builds the channel each week it would help to more quickly see if my anecdotal observations are just me being fooled by market randomness and a very greedy eye. I'll go snoop about for your 3 line break though. That sounds interesting too. Thanks again.

I wonder how this model would look on Oanda 's 3H charts? I just finnished reading all of the posts in this thread and unfortunately I use Oanda, no 4H chart. Just wondering if anyone else has tried using this model on Oanda's 3H charts. Im currently sitting at a work computer and unable to check this, I cant wait to get home and sift through some 3H charts to see what I find. I dont have much time durring the day to study charts anymore due to work and commute, 122 miles a day. This trading model is exactly the type of thing I've been looking for. I'll post my findings after I get home if it's worth posting. Although 3H and 4H is a very big difference. Heny

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Henyloc, I got some of the same time issues you do, and so I can relate. The 4 hour bars for my broker don't match the open and close times for Nomask's broker. So, I investigated and believe if you work the 1 hour bars/candles starting from Friday 1400 GMT you will get the same result. One contributor came up with a good twist. If the price spread, high to low for that original review period does not equal at least 100 pips, extend your analysis back an additional 4 hours (so back to 1200 GMT). If the spread is still less than 100 pips, do the math to see how short of 100 you are, take half of that, and add that amount to each side. So your minmum channel width is 100 pips, with a TP goal of 200 pips minimum. If the first try fails, your new TP becomes 300 pips minimum. And of course, if you don't reach the goal by the end of the week (say 1 hour before closing) exit your position, whatever it happens to be. Now, the only trick for you is to find out your brokers offset from GMT, if any. Do you need help with that?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Oanda is kinda strange with the GMT thing. Im not sure If I completely have it figured out. On all my charts the 1hour candle correlates exactly to my local time. Unlike MT4 , the current candle will always be offset based on the location of the server in use for that broker. If the close of the week is 5PM EST , that would be 2PM my time PST. So how I am understanding this is, I would take the close of my 2PM hourly and go back 8hours. If within that timeframe I do not have a 100pip or more range I would go back an additional 4 hours but no more. After that if needed I would just add the difference divided equally to each side. If my stoploss is hit thus triggering my trade in the opposite direction, would I reset the trade initially stopped out? Or did I miss somthing and a re-read of this thread is in order. I really appreciate the help!. Heny

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Heny, you've got it, old chap! Say a long trade is triggered. You'll stay in that until you make your profit target (channel range X 2), or the end of the the week, or your stoploss is hit. Stop loss is the opposite side of the channel, which means as you take that loss you are opening your short position. The new position now has a target price of channel range X 3. You hold that new position until you are stopped again, or the end of the week. That is how the rules currently read. I can't attest to viability of opening a third position. I don't think that happens very often at all. Until we have a chance to look back at three or four years we can't get an idea about it. I am hoping that Hayseed will bless us with an EA, and possibly an indicator that can help us evaluate this. His point, if you missed it, is that we might find a better time to put our orders in place beyond the Sunday open. We can't figure that kind of thing out until we get some brain power crunching on this. I just don't have any time to work the details as of yet. I'm hoping I'll get some space next week. Until then I'm working this in a very small account just because it looks so lovely and consistent. In other words, "blind faith". Good luck. I'd love to hear anything you might conclude from your studies.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I just finished doing a quick visual of this system on 5 pairs using Harold's rules (minus the 100 pip rule for less volitile pairs) and it does look pretty good. I too noticed that gaps and Sunday data can cause some bad entries so perhaps you're correct about Sunday entries. Maybe including the Sunday data in the H/L range with the 8hr. Fri. data would be a good solution.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I think the best solution is to just forget about it when it gaps.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
The possibility of that being the best option must not be dismissed. Thanks Billbss.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Where can I get this EA?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
EA for once a week trade?!!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
The "Weekly Gbpjpy Breakout System" Nomask mention in January. From Newbee on the block. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
aj2008: There is no EA currently for this system. Nor is there an indicator. Hayseed said it would not be difficult to code, and that it is similar to one he did for another system. I looked at that other system, and from a coding perspective he is right, it could be easily adapted. From a user perspective, I don't think you can use one of those EAs to do this. It has to be changed. He may make it. He may not. Didn't say anything about doing it. Free EAs come to threads where there is "enough" interest and participation. Your coming here helps. Your asking for an EA when it is clear to anyone who would have read the full 50 posts that there isn't one, doesn't help. Howard: There is more than one use for an EA, my friend. We can use them to identify optimal TP and SL settings. Other things may also be revealed in analysis as well. Having said that, if the optimal time to put your orders on was at a time that someone couldn't be at a terminal, then someone might want to use an EA, even for a weekly system. I suspect there could be more opportunities within this than the one we are currently exploiting. Those opportunities might make this into something that could be traded throughout the week, and possibly multiple times. You do know there are many ways to the mountain top, right?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yes and thanks for your prompt reply. I am just a Newbee trying to learn as much as I can before trading in live account. It very kind to find people such as yourself who are willing to impart their Forex wisdom and knowledge and for that I thank you. Regards "Newbee on the Block"

GBP/JPY has risen to be in the breakout channel. I'm going to treat it as if it has already broken the sell threshold and made profit and it was too late to enter. In other words, wait until next week.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
This week was a good example of how if price makes it to 1X the channel height and reverses back to the channel, it will tend to cross all the way to the other side. As Billbss indicates above, price gapped, and went on to take out the 2X profit target, before coming back to close the gap, and continuing on to cross the channel. Once it got that far it has stalled. We have more news coming today at the top of the hour. I look forward to eventually having time to see if Billbss has this gap thing in the right perspective, historically. It makes sense to me. It might be worth playing differently if the price had not made the 2X target. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the week plays out. But we are getting a great demonstration of how price plays around this channel. As I write this price is trying to back away from the resistance, 30 minutes before the news. We'll see if this is just trying to drive out the weak before going higher, or if people (institutions) are locking in profit before uncertain news. If the news is good, we might see the high target taken out. Tomorrow is the day before Non Farm Payrolls in the US. Usually not a great day for trading. Tonight is the UK Rate Statement though, so who knows where we are headed, and how fast.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
First off, the price points for this comming week according to IBFX: 1400-2200 GMT Low: 205.62 High: 207.94 Channel height: 232 pips Original rules Profit targets: Low - 200.98; High - 212.58 I have manually reviewed the first 4 months of last year to look at some variables, and alternatives. My review is not complete, but I did want to point out a couple of things. First, a take profit at 1 X the channel height in pips is successful 77% of the time on the first breakout (17 of 22 attempts). 8 of 17 that reached 1 X were strong enough to move on to 2 X. In the 5 cases I've studied so far where price failed on the original breakout, 80% of the time it succeeded in making 1 X target on the opposite side. And 60% of the time it succeeded in making 2 X target. So there was only 1 week so far where you couldn't have made money or broken even using level orders. BUT, in that week the market didn't hit the stop loss either, and you would have lost 1 pip + spread. -- To be clearer. 3 out of 5 weeks went to 2 X. Of the 2 that didn't make 2 X, 1 was a tiny loss (by the open of the weeks last bar), and the other made better than 1.5 X. In weeks with an opening gap... there were 5. Mind you an opening gap is not a gap above or below the close of the previous week, but a close above or below the defined channel (according to our rules). The only pure losing week came on such a gap. Interestingly though, of the 4 weeks that didn't lose, if you waited for a return to 1/2 the channel (so you reach dead center, and then place your stop orders), when you jump in you will achieve a 2 X profit pretty easily... And again, the one time you didn't, was the only week studied so far that you couldnt get to TP on either side, and you only lost the 1 pip + spread. So, what can I learn from this small sample (keeping in mind, it is a VERY small sample)? With regard to gaps, I don't think we have to worry about them as much as I originally feared. This past week opened with a gap, but what made it different from any of the weeks I've looked at in depth so far is: .... It didn't close the gap by Monday... In fact, it didn't close the gap until Wednesday. That seems pretty unusual. So, for now, I'm planning to trade weeks with a gap ...IF 1. The gap closes no later than Monday 2359 GMT. 2. Price returns to the middle of the channel before I put on my orders. I don't know when I'll have time to complete this study, but at least I've seen where the majority of gaps are not as fearsome as originally thought. I also think it might be wise to open 2 positions, close the first at 1X and let the other run with a trailing stop of something like 100 pips, and a target of 2X. I hope this stimulates others to take a closer look too.

Oh, and I almost forgot. If the 1X target is made on either side, and the market reverses to enter the channel again, it is about 80% successful in reaching the other side of the channel... BUT ONLY IF YOU at least reach the 1X target first. This happened at least 20 times in the 22 weeks, and as many as 3 times in one week.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Qman, that's some great research! From your findings it sounds like there may be a few ways to trade this strategy. I'm going to give it a try this coming week using the 1X option.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Is anyone placing this trade with the two bars for a large 232pips, or would you consider only using the last 4hour bar for about 117pip range? From reviewng Qman's stats, keeping both orders available regardless if one hits as a winner or looser could give high odds the other will be a winner too. As a result from Qmans stat's, thinking of multiple trade exit strategy of placing 2 or even 3 trades. 1st trade profit = 1x (move stop loss to break even or plus 15pips) 2nd trade profit = 1.5x (move stop loss to +50pips) 3rd trade profit = 2x what are your toughts? I woudl think the completion of Qman's stats may provide more supportive evidence for or against this idea. all in all, i like this methodology due to spending a little time on sunday before open and waiting for alerts to make adjustments. T4L

Using North Finance, the range (including a 9 pip spread) is 243 pips. I would not mess with the rules that harold backtested. I made money with his rules for 5 or 6 straight weeks. I didn't enter a trade last week. I would use a North Finance demo to get the range. That is the platform he backtested with. Qman may be on to something, but 21 trials is not of statistical significance. Just my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Yes, not statistically significant. And, someday, when I finish the analysis, it still won't be statistically significant, until I can look at other years. At the rate I'm going, it will be a long, long time before I can get statistically significant data all compiled. Until then, trade at your own risk. Having said that, putting on orders to maximize profit prior to Nomask's target points is not too far from the rules, and should make sense as long as one is not getting too many positions set. Taking profit earlier on some should help with your winning percentage some, but you might also lose on some of the moves that go the full 2X. Statistically, that would work against you if it went that distance more often than it didn't. For the first half of 2007, that wasn't the case, but again, small sample. Take profit earlier if you are only comfortable with a high percentage of wins, and can live with leaving some profit on the table... because ultimately, you will. I am set with two positions on each side. One will go for 1X, the other for 2X. The 2X position will probably have a 100 pip Trailing stop once the 1X hits... though I might change that number because it is too round and subject to a stop hunt. I'm toying with the idea of puting an 85 pip TS on the position running for the 1X. I really hate to see things go from largely positive to a loss. I'll also be ready to jump on a reversal through the channel. So once 1X is achieved on either side, I'll have a stop set on the near side of the channel to catch the retrace. The range on this channel is around 232, so by the original rules, the 2X goal is 464 pips. Certainly not unheard of with GBPJPY, but to get there on the short side, we'll be setting some new lows, and that makes it a little longer shot, even in a downtrend. Not saying it is impossible, or improbable, just harder. The carry trade system I work with kind of argues for a bounce here to clear my average position. There is no real technical reason for this(fibs could be a factor, but I'm not going to that detail -- my systems don't require it), or a fundamental reason. But we've been going down for a good while now, and we're possibly due for a retracement. Those tend to eventually close out the carry trade average that appears, which for me right now is above 210. That seems in agreement with the long entry for this system, so I'm liking how that looks.... But the market can do whatever it likes, I'm just trying to ride it wherever it goes. I just hope when it gets going, it goes far enough. The perfect week for me would actually be, trigger short on this system. Reach 1X, then reverse through the channel (let me capture that move), and continue on to the 1.5X+ area by the end of the week, so I can capture that move with this system, and comfortably close my carry trade average too. So, now that we know what is perfect for me, you all know one thing the market is NOT likely to do.

though i backtest with nf i realy dont think it would make a difference in fact sometimes nf data is very different from others fridays nf is 20796 for the high and 205.64 for the low others have it 20741 and 20625

--- 帖子 #78 ---
They are all different due to different start times for their 4H bars and to different Friday closing times. If you did your backtesting with NF, I'd rather stick with it.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
This is why I'm going with 1 hour bars, starting at 1400 GMT to the closing bar. And if that doesn't get us to a 100 pip channel, I will go back to the 1000 GMT bar. That allows me to overcome the difference in 4 hour bar start times, and I end up working with the same times as originally proposed. Thus, the difference should just be the standard few pips seen between brokers for the same 1 hour bar.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Not if you're using IBFX. IBFX closes a couple of hours earlier, on Friday, than the rest of the brokers do. It's final 4H bar does not get all of the price movement. It makes a difference.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Wow... Thanks... I didn't know that. Back to the drawing board... and yet, I've gotten favorable results based on my analysis so far. Maybe it won't matter in the end... Time will tell. So, what do you have for a high and low on the channel, if I may ask?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Okay, I just downloaded a North Finance demo. Looked, and for this week there isn't much difference. The only difference would come if the 1 extra hour candle at the end of the NF week holds a higher high or lower low than those defining the channel earlier, NF and IBFX would be about the same. A quick scan of the last 5 weeks showed that final bar did not make a change. But I realize that it might. I'll look back more completely in the near future to see if I can quantify how often this has happened. Thanks Billbss for point this out.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Short has been triggered

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Looking back through July 2007, the influence of the additional 1 hour bar that IBFX is missing each week, comes into play, or is a factor in this system about 1 time every 4 weeks. When this bar changes the channel size, about half the time it is a significant factor in how trades play out the following week, and half the time it does not. The majority of the times it is a factor it is to the advantage of the trader, but not always. In the long run, it would seem to be worth considering, but not factoring this is probably not going to change the system from a winner to a loser. It changes the results significantly about once ervery 2 months. Thanks again, Billbss

HI guys, Have been following this system with great interest. I am relatively new to forex and am looking for a mechanical type system. I have spent most of the weekend backtesting this system and although the results looked promising to start with when I applied the system and stepped through every trade it unfortunately doesn't look to good for the way I would trade it over the 2005 and 2006 years. Before I go on I just want to say I am new to this and there is always the possibility that my backtesting is flawed in some way. I have attached my spreadsheet and MT4 template to show the setups for each trade. I trialed 2 systems side by side. I have used harolds rules. System 1 - Take profit at 1x channel. Use the 2 bar, then back to 3 bar. If channel less than 100pips. Make a 100 pip channel. Add 7 pips on to upper level of channel (allowance for spread). Buy and sell stop orders placed 3 pips outside of upper and lower channel lines to allow for channel to be actually broken before entry. Stop levels also set at 3 pips outside of channel again to allow for channel to actually be broken before being stopped out. Take profit at 1x channel band. Gaps - Ignore smaller gags - less than 20 pips.) For larger gaps If gap is filled within the channel trade as per normal. If it gaps outside of channel, don't take the trade. If price returns to channel and closes gap, trade as per normal. (I actually backtested ignoring gaps vs waiting for them to close and it didn't really make much difference to the bottom line) If the first trade is successful then thats it for the week. If the first trade fails, Take a trade in the opposite direction if triggered. System 2 - Take profit at 2x channel. Same as above but take profit at 2 x channel band. Risk Risk is 1% of account on each trade ( compounded). I see the system profitability is sometimes measured in pips instead of return on account. I'm still trying to figure out how that accurately measures profitability. (I'm still a newbie, remember). For me I will only risk a set % per trade. Whether the channel is 100 pips wide or 400 pips wide it will still be 1% risk. This means that some pips will be worth $1 (100pip chan) or 25 cents (400 pip chan). Again, if I am missing something here I would appreciate more experienced people pointing me in the right direction. I have also subtracted 5% off of the winning trades. This is to allow for the 3 pip buffer on either side of the channel. (probably more like 3% but I like to allow for the worst case scenario) RESULTS System 1 - Take profit at 1x channel. 2005 - 7.95% return on account 2006 - 9.62% return on account System 2 - Take profit at 2x channel. 2005 - 8.78% return on account 2006 - 2.04% return on account I hope some of the more experienced guys will look at my spreadsheet and tell me I am wrong because I like the look of this system. ps 2007 results look a lot better than this. Maybe 20% + on account but haven't finished test yet.

BigRicky, Firstly, thank you for your hard work. No matter what anybody ends up saying about it down the road, good bad or indifferent, I applaud your contribution. I'll have to look at what you've got more closely and do some deep thinking. I'm no expert, but I work on it a little bit everyday, really. Someday, when I grow up... That said, I can't see if you accounted for sort of the "final scenario". That is, under original rules, you try for 2X, and if that fails, you try for 3X. If your 3X attempt doesn't get stopped out, you hold to the close of the week. So, in some cases you might end up with 2.25X or 2.75X. Indeed, I suspect there are 3X weeks as well; and I'm not seeing this accounted for in your spreadsheet. You might get a fair bit of feedback on Net Return vs. Pips. If I think on it some I might be able to write something that makes sense, but one thing that jumps out right away is that people are using different account types, and obviously different account amounts, as well as different % of account at risk. If we had the raw numbers for each week in your 3 year study we could do a fair bit more analysis too. For example, many people will factor the size of their position based upon the max drawdown. The way you've calculated things that kind of statistic is filtered. Finally, we can't really see if there is a trend in the numbers, such as, Profit targets with channels greater than X (250 pips, 300 pips, etc.) are very rarely achieved (stated here only as an example, not as a fact). A natural question that comes up in the course of these things is the viability of a trailing stop, or stops in general, and what the correct levels should be. I'm experimenting with this right now, as a matter of fact. This week, I opened 2 positions. One with a 1X TP, one with a 2X TP. I know from looking back over the weeks that I have studied that more than half the time the market will not make the 2X mark. I also know, 2X seems more plausible on the second move of the week. I suspect that the 2X on the first move this week could be a bit tough, seeing how far we had to go, AND take out a new low... So, on my 1X position, once it was 1/2 the way to profit, I put on a TS. As things go, I was just stopped out (Tuesday's Asian market surged down, and has retraced some -- enough to hit my stop). Well, I now feel safe to let the 2X position run... if it will, because I've got money off the table. If it reverses all the way to the channel without hitting the 1X TP, I can close it and watch to see what happens next. If it pushes forward to the 1X, I figure to put on a channel crossing reverse position if it gets there (I'll probably put a TS on it once it gets half way across). The market will do what it wants to do, but I've seen enough to consider that a move up might have a better shot at the 2X -- at least for this week. If it doesn't do it, that's fine. If it finds 2X going down on the first move of the week, so be it (I'm already in profit, and I'll make some more too). Okay, I know I'm rambling on... Sorry. My main point is that there is much to consider about how to trade this channel breakout. When you work off your account balance we miss the details of the trade, the nuts and bolts. There could be a big difference between making 1% on a 100 pip move, and making 1% on a 400 pip move. The market that moves 100 pips if fundamentally different from the market that is able to move 400 pips. I hope you see my point here. When to expect which, and the probability of each are things to consider. At some point I think one has to look at the upcoming week and evaluate possible news influences on the market. A market with virtually no news is less likely to run 500 or 600 pips, no matter what your channel size is telling you. Your money management approach looks very prudent, and is an intelligent, if conservitive (for me), way to approach trading this system. But to refine the system we need to look at the raw numbers, and THEN eventually see if your money management is too conservative for this system, just right, or outrageously risky. Again, what you are doing is probably fine based on what we already know about this system. But in my thinking, a money management approach is applied after you've analyzed what you can expect from the system. On your template, as I was reading your post I got the impression I'd somehow see all the plots for all the weeks, but the only thing showing on my screen is the current week. Just checking to see if that is what you packaged. Thanks again for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
results for 2005 were 2200 pips 2006 1300 pips 2007 4100 pips thats how you determine profitablity

--- 帖子 #88 ---
In a way. All pips aren't equal, though. This week, for example, if my trade hits profit, it will have gained 240 something pips. I will have made the same money as a week when it only took 125 pips to hit profit. I size my trades to risk 2% if I lose. I also make 2% if I win.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Qman, Thanks for the reply. I haven't yet tested the 2x / 3x system. Just the 1x / 1x and 2x / 2x. I will look at this. (Your'e right this was the original and I should have tested it.) If you scroll back to 2005 and 2006 on the template you will see the drawn in channels (Haven't done 2007 yet) I only used 1% account system, as this is the only way I know how to test a system (Yes, I am a conservative trader). I would love to know how to convert the positive pip total that this system returns into a repeatable R/R type system but as of yet I don't know how to do this. Harold, Thanks for your reply. I sense that you were a little frustrated by my post. Please be kind, I am just new and trying to learn. I realise you must get lots of newbies making inaccurate posts here, but the only reason I spent time testing this system is because it looked very sound. Would you be able to explain to me what money management, R/R system you would use to convert the good annual pips returned into a trading system. Thanks for your help guys.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
bigricky, You can see what Billbss has posted. He is a seasoned trader, and he does this similarly to you, except he is doing 2%. I think that is very reasonable for this system, based on what we know about it so far. One might be able to risk more depending on what all the numbers work out to, and whateverelse someone has going on in their account. As I was trying to write earlier, I think you have a solid approach. It's just that, in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of this system, you have to look at the pip counts to see what percentage of your account makes sense to trade (and in my case, when, since I expect to take positions on a reverse cross of the channel at some point during the week). And that gets to the point of my interest.... I really like this little system, but I think there are additional opportunities lurking in here. I'm a very analytical person by nature, but I do detailed analytical work in my real job all day long. So, when it comes to diving into a hard look at FOREX I'm often just running on fumes. Sort of ticks me off, cause if I could apply myself when I'm at 100% I know I'd make better progress... So, hang in there. People like Billbss are really cool. They don't send you in a wrong direction very often. If you pay attention you'll learn something everyday.... Little things, like, "Hey, your broker closes before everybody else ... (you dolt!)..." Okay, I just added that last part. He's usually pretty tactful ....

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Billbss, Thats how I see it aswell when taking one of these trades I risk a certain amount of account (either 1% or 2%) on each trade. The number of pips doesn't really matter. (Unless backtesting proves that smaller or larger pip channels are more sucessful etc..). This is what I based my backtest on and came up with the above figures(1% RR). 2% RR per trade 2005 1x chan 17.93% 2x chan 19.71% 2006 1x chan 21.70% 2x chan 5.36% If anybody else has backtested this with a fixed % RR system, or can show a different system that shows a different result I would be keen to swap spreadsheets and compare notes Thanks guys

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Qman, Looked at a 2x chan trade, and if it fails go for 3x on the next swing (like the original system). 2005 Only went to 3x chan 3 times (3 % to previous figure) 2006 Didn't make it to 3% chan at all.( Actually closed under 2% creating a lower profit) RESULTS (2% account per trade) 2005 T/P 1x (2nd trade 1x) 17.93% 2005 T/P 2x (2nd trade 2x) 19.71% 2005 T/P 2x (2nd trade 3x) 26.86% 2006 T/P 1x (2nd trade 1x) 21.70% 2006 T/P 2x (2nd trade 2x) 5.36% 2006 T/P 2x (2nd trade 3x) 1.07%

Have just finished the backtest for 2007. As expected, very good results 2007 (2% risk per trade - compounded) 1x chan T/P (2nd trade 1x) 46.09% 2x chan T/P (2nd trade 2x) 65.21% 2x chan T/P (2nd trade 3x) 47.16% Updated SS and MT4 template attached

Bigricky, thanks for your continued hard work. That was a brilliant idea of yours to use the fibo tool to draw all these lines. Since you've done your analysis for 2007, I was wondering if you had a template with the plots for that year. The last one I downloaded didn't have anything for 2007. If you've got the work done it would be a time saver for all of us if you can provide it. Nomask, good to see you checked back in here. Wonderful little system you have here. Thank you very much for sharing.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Qman, last post has the latest MT4 template attached to it.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thanks for the feedback Nomask. I am looking at some optomisation idea's now. If you guys have any ideas of the things that might be good to trial please post them. Idea's so far. After we take a 1x profit and price returns to the channel, probability of it crossing the chan to the otherside and taking another position.( This was mentioned earlier in the thread by you guys) Seasonality? (A new concept for me, But system seems to perform better at the end of the year) Compare results from 2bar, 3bar and 100 pip entries. Possibility of a 3rd trade if the first 2 failed + a few other things. Basically I have the time to backtest but am lacking some of the experience. So as not to waste my time testing things that may be pointless please give me some feedback and any other ideas that might be worth testing. Nomask, I am happy to start a new thread if that is the normal thing to do in this situation (Am quite new to posting and don't really know the right protocols), although I would prefer to carry on posting here if that is alright with you. Thanks Richard

--- 帖子 #98 ---
As fond as I am of the idea that price will re-cross the channel after getting 1x -- if it returns to the channel, that is... In looking at your earlier years just briefly, it seems that this is a more recent phenomena, probably related to the greater volatility of the market. No one can say where we are headed with any certainty, but it seems to me that as more people start "playing" in the forex markets the more volatility we are seeing. Just an opinion, and that may not be what is really going on at all. But, if volatility continues to increase then I think this crossing trade will work. In quieters times, it would seem it won't. So, to be more confident in this trade we would want to have some sort of tip-off that the market was "generally" volitile enough... How to determine? Lots of people use ATR to try to quantify volatility. I'm not sure that is best, but it would be a start. In that same vein, it might be worth looking at ATR for the previous week vs what your channel height is. It seems logical that a bigger ATR and a smaller channel might lead to a higher succes ratio, but the market sometimes resists such logic. But I think it is worth a look. I quickly glanced at about 8 months last week, without the benefit of your lines, mind you, and thought I saw something about Fridays. If from 0000 Friday morning to the close, price was up significantly, Sunday and Monday, longs were favorable, and vice versa. If there was no significant difference (say price opened and closed within 40 or 50 pips) neither is favored (even chance). There is the regular host of lagging indicators, of course. One thing I started looking into this morning was where a Stochastic(7,5,5 for no particular reason) was when price crossed the trigger. Seemed like if Stochastic was at 80 for long, or 20 for short, there was a higher failure rate or that cross was early -- and one could have waited for a later crossing in the same or opposite trade direction. Also, seemed like a higher success rate if Stochastic was below 50 when price crossed for the buy, and above 50 when price crossed for the sell. I've taken about a 10 minute look at trendlines based on the fractal indicator... sort of thinking along the Moteki system but applied to 1 hour charts, using the weekly trigger points to jump into a trade if the trendline was favorable, and closing out when the trendline was violated. Would have worked like a charm this week... but that's just 1 week. Food for thought though. You may be opening Pandora's box here. It seems the system trades very well with the original rules, and nobody should lose sight of that fact. I'm all for optimising, but too often people are looking for something that is 100% correct. That is just never going to happen. Those are some thoughts that might get you started. There are some far greater minds than mine that visit here. I hope they will chime in. Oh, and don't forget that Hayseed stopped by here. He has some really interesting tricks he does with his EAs. So, if he eventually decides he wants to work on this, I know he will get some thing going that we'll all find amazing... But I know he is a busy man.

IBFX had price break the trigger line for a long by 1 pip before retreating. Anybody else get in long?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I'm out at 1x profit on the short. That's me for the week. (It came within 2 pips of stopping me out before heading south again). I have looked at a few more options with the system. Looked at taking the cross channel trade after hitting the 1x profit. As you had already observed Qman this doesn't look to be very consistent or profitable so dropped that idea. Also noticed that Jan - April are the most profitable months across all 3 years. Could be coincidence or seasonal!!! I don't know enough about this subject to comment. I don't think I would consider trading only certain months. Qman - I would rather not look at introducing indicators. I know they would probably help but I am trying to go "Indicator Free" these days whenever possible. And I don't want to get too involved with fundamentals either. One thing I didn't look at initially was look at going for a 2x target after the first 1x target failed. (This is a bit more in line with Nomasks original 2x / 3x system). Results are favorable and consistent across all 3 years. With 2% account risk. (Compounded) 2005 Increase from 17.93 to 19.83% 2006 Increase from 21.70 to 26.11% 2007 Increase from 46.09 to 61.27% I'm not going to dick around with this system anymore at this stage. Like you say it looks reasonable sound. The other thing is I am very conscious that my backtesting skills are at an early stage of development and it is possible I am missing something fundamental here. So I will demo trade this for now and focus on improving my backtesting knowledge. Richard

Interesting system. But it seems like working only for GBP/JPE. Don't have a lot of time right now, so i only post indicator which a have made today. Settings are very easy, but if you will have questions i'll answer... Indy is only for 4H timeframe without sat and sund candles.

It worked again. That's about 7 in a row for me.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
So, it seems you did not attempt a 2X win, as the original rules indicate. Are you applying some logical cutoff if the channel is too big, or if the 1X comes too late in the week.... or are you only gunning for 1X all the time?

Hey billbss, are you placing you trades on sunday evening, or does it really matter when I place my trades being they are usually triggered at a later time anyway. BTW im pacific time. Heny

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I place my trades on Sunday evening, as soon as my broker opens for business. They are usually triggered later that night.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Awesome! thanks for the fast reply

--- 帖子 #108 ---
This week was a real squeaker, because of the large Friday range. Price immediately fell over 300 pips from the Sunday open. This is almost always enough to make your profit and be done with it for the week. It wasn't this week. Price then went north and came within 2 pips of stopping me out. Then it reversed last night and went down enough to make profit. The only lesson I learned from this is to stick to the rules. Don't try to get fancy. Just keep doing what's been working.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Unfortunately, that spurt to within 2 points from your broker translated to stopping me out by 1 pip. Double the pain then, because that got me long just in time for the next plunge. So following the rules very strictly would have given me a double loss where it gave you a win. Fortunately, this is extraordinarily rare. I expect I won't have to juggle the system as much in the future as I did this week. I count myself fortunate that I was able to take some profit on the original move (a small variation from the rules), and some of the reverse too, and a bit of the second drop, so that I just about broke even. (I thought crossing the line by a pip was a bit suspect, so I was prepared to re-enter on the sell signal with a smaller lot, and a nearer goal. The goal at that point was to break even). But no question, this has been a difficult week. Many will be easier, I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Did you take your prices from IBFX or North Finance? It could have happened to me too. If it had, that would have made me 6 wins and two losses since I started trading it in January- still not bad.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi billbss, How do you combat any gapping that often occurs during the weekend? If the price gaps below the range do you just trade from that price or do you wait for it to retrace back into the range before setting your trades for the week? Thanks, pn

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I've only dealt with that one time. I waited for price to go back into the range, then set my orders. Last week it gapped big. It was a few days before it rose back into the range. The NFP was looming and I didn't place any orders.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
That's exactly what I've been looking at, the gap this week was huge! I think on weeks like that the system should/could be given a week off as we've probably already missed our flight!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
There wasn't a gap this week. There was a big gap last week.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Totally correct! I meant last week not this one!! Where does the time go??

--- 帖子 #116 ---
After learning from you, I downloaded the NF demo and used the prices from that... Although, this week there were not any differences. I posted earlier, looking back, there is a difference about 1 week in every 4. It is significant, as in, would change the results, either for or against, about half the time. So it is overall significant about 1 week every 2 months, but it is certainly worth watching. --- So this week I was just a bit unlucky, but I kept my wits and came out even, so, live to trade another week. Learning all the time.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi to all! This weekend i have made EA for this system with one exception. EA don't stop to trade if one of the order was closed by TP, it still can open the opposite trade. So we can have 2 profit trade in one week - one BUY one SELL. EA and Indy (needed for EA) are below. Backtests show good results for 2007, not bad for 2006 and loses for 2005, but 1999 is profitable, for example. So, i'll be glad to hear your opinion on EA and soughths how to make it profitable in 2005 for example.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Dezil, Thanks for your coding effort. One question before I begin looking things over. How does your EA handle gaps like we saw this Sunday?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi, Qman! EA wait when the price goes back to channel. Enter buffer of 10 pip i use as filter for jpen and close. You can set in to 0

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Whether yesterday was a gap or not, depended on your broker. North Finance opened yesterday evening with price a little above the sell threshold. If a person had been using them. they would have taken profit last night. I trade with IBFX. It opened an hour later that NF and price had already fallen below the sell point.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Anybody try this system with other pairs? thanks

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Check post 50 (or near there), and there is another quick reference after that, but I couldn't find it in the 2 minutes I was looking... I just know it is there. Post 50 says it isn't seen in a couple of other pairs checked. The later post said it might be in a couple of other pairs (I don't remember specifics). In short, I don't know how complete the analysis has been on this.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Interesting question about how to handle this system for the coming week due to the Good Friday lack of trading. Going by strict rules I show the top of the channel after enlarging for min channel height of 100, at 197.71; bottom at 196.71. The question is, would it be better to look back at Thursday's activity instead. I guess we'll know for sure what was best... next Friday. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
The rule about adding pips to the range to make it at least 100 was made for days like today. I'd stay with the rules and stay with Friday.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I always wanted a GBPJPY breakout strategy. I will test this out over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
My question is why limit this to a week. If say on Tuesday the TP has been hit. Why not take the previous 2 - 3 4H bars and start over? To potentially execute 2-3 TPs in a week?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
...ummmm... because we're lazy minded, and haven't been wise enough to look and see if it might work... Just a thought. Look over the last couple of weeks, and if you find it might be possible, I'll try to spend some time on it in the coming week.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Well... go for it and let us know what you find!! Some of us have done the work... and have found that this pair is unique among all the pairs in that there is a defined move at the beginning of the new week, that this breakout strategy capitalizes on.... looking at other times through the week, we have not seen the same moves, hence, not the same results... But still, always good to have another set of eyes looking at things! Keep us posted... And... keep in mind, 2000 to 4000 pips a year for the last 3 or so years is pretty dang good! And that is the simple 1x system, once a week, reentry on loss only..!!!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Another winner!- using harold's rules as written.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
yes, +200 on this one

--- 帖子 #131 ---
it also most triggered the sell but it didnt and went on to hot 100 pip target i am glad this is not horseshoes otherwise we would have lost

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Excellent! Congratulations! eagles

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Can any of this week winner post a screenshot of his/her trade Thanks

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Here we go

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks Howard for your screenshot. Do you mind marking the candeles you used for your entry and what is the indicator you have on your chart . Thanks and regards

--- 帖子 #139 ---
The thick blue line looks like a Gann Hi/Low line to me and the red lines on Howard's chart look to be the range of the bars you use as your "breakout" zone with this strategy. The thin blue line looks like a daily range indicator or something like, maybe weekly pivots? pn

--- 帖子 #140 ---
The blue line is Gann H/L it has nothing to do with this method, the red lines show the breakout channel and blue thin lines show 1X channel width for those who want to take profits at this level. According to the rules however the the profit level should be at 2X channel width and that is what I do. The breakout channel indicator is in this thread, you can download it.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Can you please post the buy and sell entry orders for this week to check it with mine

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I was two thirds correct then!!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Using North Finance (as in harold4x's backtesting) the signals on my server are: Buy 199.70 (you will need to add your broker's spread to this) Sell 197.52 Is this what you have?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Thanks purenirvana, yes same figures here using FXCM

--- 帖子 #145 ---
can we use the last 8 hours instead of using the last 2 candles, will it give us the same result?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
8=2x4 It is the same

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Nil balance here this week, went short stopped out, went long +100

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Actually, it depends on your broker. Some, like IBFX, close earlier than North Finance (broker used by the originator of the system). Also, you would need to keep in mind the server time of your broker as well. To be precise, you should be using the high and low of the GMT 1400 to GMT 2100 bars (unless something got screwy with the daylight savings time calculations). Overall, I've found it easier to just get a demo account with NF and pull the numbers from there (last 2 4H bars of the previous week). They also provide the advantage of opening an hour earlier on Sunday than IBFX -- something that would have made a huge difference just 2 weeks ago... So, if you are really serious about puting a big portion of your account at risk with this system, you might want to consider having an account that doesn't introduce the bugs IBFX does with their week start and end times... not to mention NF has a much lower spread.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I have been backtesting this system on daily basis, it seems to work really good. I have been trading it on demo for the last 4 weeks and the result is !!! good I can say. I use the last 2-3 candles on the 1 hr time frame to determine the proper range. I wait for the first hour to end, Then I set my orders. I use febo levels to determine my targets. BK

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I had been working on similar system when I found this thread. I have modified the indicator in this thread so that you can have it on the H1 TF. This way you can choose how many hourly bars you want to consider. If there is a gap I suggest that we consider the first hour of the new week as well, this can be set by choosing "true" in the "gap" selection. This indicator works only for H1 and H4 TF's (by switching to H4 TF you get the original indicator). In the top left you can see how far away the price is from the box top and bottom and how wide the channel is. The box is always a minumum 100 pips wide. Also you can see the average range of the week. I have found that if the box is taken for the first hour of the new week and the last hour of the previous week it gives a very good range for the breakout. Regarding the average range of the week I'm still testing to see how this can be used in this strategy. One thought is what happens if the price has traveled X pips and turned around - how far is it likely to go to the otherside depending on how much is left on the average range. Red = Range, Blue = 1X TP, Aqua = 2X TP

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I've made EA for this system and test it on 4H with 1xTP. System works but only in 2006,2007,and by now in 2008. 2000-2005 it waste all account whith high speed. I stopped research by now. We need something to bind system to volatility of current market

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I think that GBPJPY depends on mostly carry trades, as long as we have a 4% gap of interest rate, volatility of this pair will still rocking. We should find out why this pair was less volatile in those years, what were the main causes? Should find out from traders who ve' been in the market for a while. Thats the first fact. The second fact is that more people got in to the forex in the last two to three years. Thats for sure had alot of effect in the market, I guess. I think this pair is still has alot to give for this system this year. Good Luck, BK

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I like this idea. But from last week to this week a lot of things can happen, and sunday open may always has gap. I would rather use this week first 8 hour bar as break out point.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Try Test On North Finance I Show +2300 For 2005 Thats As Far Back As I Went

The GBP/JPY trade is still open.

Not here it aint

--- 帖子 #158 ---
The high &amp; low of my channel was 203.47/202.15, I think any diffs must be in bar timing &amp; /or broker diff. It went long for me then stopped &amp; went short &amp; gave +100.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hit profit. That's 11W / 2L since January.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi Billbss, What is your T/P? 1x chanell or 2x chanell? Thanks

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I'm using 1x on the first breakout. If it gets stopped out, I use 2x on a second breakout.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
That is very impressive. Just wanted ask about your feel. I don't mean to criticize this approach. Do you feel comfortable to take trade with real money based on this result. I mean is there a consistent price behavior that makes this possible rather than pure chance, in your opinion? Thanks TS

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I trade it with real money. It has backtested profitably for several years, using harold's rules. Sucessful backtests are all we ever have to go on.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yeap, nice ideea

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks billbss. Sorry, I didn't realize you are trading real money. Thanks for the feedback. Is there a specific post that explains the harold's rules. Thanks again. TS

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Post #9. There is a later post that shows additional profit by using 2x Range TP on the second breakout (if the 1st is stopped out). I don't remember where it is, but it's later in the thread.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Looks to me the T/P on long position was missed by 1 pip.. is that correct??

--- 帖子 #168 ---
It was missed by 20 something pips. The trade is still active. It hasn't been stopped out. I use North Finance chart.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
by 20 pips??? I got North finance: High: 207.41 Low: 206.31 TP for long 208.60 TP for short 206.31 it's my setup wrong??

--- 帖子 #170 ---
sorry.. tp for short 205.12

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Your set up is wrong. You aren't adding the spread.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
207.41-206.31=110 pips channel 207.41 + 110 + 9(spread) = 208.60 206.31 - 110 - 9(spread) = 205.12 so where is the problem?? I have to add 2x spread?? thanks for your patience, billbss

--- 帖子 #173 ---
H= 207.41 L=206.31 With a 9 pip spread: Buy at 207.51 That is 1 pip above the H + spread. Sell at 206.30 That is 1 pip below the L. Range now = 121 pips. BUY / SL=206.30 / PT=208.72 SELL / SL=207.51 / PT=205.09

--- 帖子 #174 ---
thanks billbss, now is it clear for me....

--- 帖子 #175 ---
another win trade, correct?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Yes. I got stopped out on my long trade, then hit 2x profit on my short.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello all, Billbss, quick question, why didn't you minus the spread as you added the spread to the buy in your orders, shouldn't the sell order have been 206.21? I'm confused a bit. Please do clarify. Also, that means your TP should have been 2X channel (110X2) 220 so Take profit is/was 206.21 - 220 = 204.01 Unless i missed something in the readings. Please correct me. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi Billbss, just wanna make sure, that this setup is right.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Here's what I show, with a 9 pip spread: Buy stop = 208.90 Sell stop = 207.29 PT for long= 210.51 PT for short = 205.68

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hello all. This is a general question, I hope I dont confuse anyone. Every sunday night we enter 2 orders, buy stop and sell stop with there respective TP/SL. After one gets triggered, we wait and hope it hits our tp, but if it reverses and we get stoped out and then we hope it will hit our 2X channel TP. My question is, at what point do you change the TP to 2X. I mean if your away from the computer and the initial breakout gets stopped out and reverses but only hits your 1Xchannel because you were not there to change the channel to 2X TP. How are you folks getting around this problem, PLEASE DO HELP, this thread is AWSOME. Thanks IA4X

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thank you so much for taking your time to explain the system further...I will like to know if u ve tried pairs like GU and EU, I think both wouldnt give bad results neither especially EU(its a good trendy pair). I took a quick glance at how EU(it looked good. I havent done a stastical back test though. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
You change your TP to 2x if you get stopped out on your initial trade. If you are not around your computer, there is nothing you can do except set the PTs for 1x initially and walk away from it. You've got to be there to change it to 2x.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I haven't looked at any other pairs. They would have to be backtested.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Another winner.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
YES, that is my first one... and yours 13 W and 2 L, correct billbss?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I've had two double stop outs. I lost count, but I think that's 14 or 15 winners and 4 losers.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
hey Bilbss, what else systems do you trade?.. I saw you on couple treads.... Thanks and sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #188 ---
+100 for me this week

--- 帖子 #189 ---
201.53 Buy stop 200.41 Sell stop TP Long 202.65 TP Short 199.29 hope i am right..

--- 帖子 #190 ---
That's what I've got.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
short hit SL, long on the scene... TP 203.77

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I set my TP at 2x the range when I get stopped out.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
yep, 202.65 + 112 pips = 203.77

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Another overall win...sell stopped out but buy hit 2x TP...im workin on something that can let us continuing trading if our TP is hit in the early part of the week...

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi guys, I have just spent the last couple hrs going through this thread and doing some backtests of my own with this system, I cant believe this thread hasnt had more interest than it has! It looks very good, and i plan to start demoing it next week. Thanks to nomask for posting it and all you guys trying to improve it etc. Kind regards Alex

--- 帖子 #196 ---
your 2xTP was hit??? not on my plattform (IBFX) (high 203.72 and 203.68) so 203.77 is still in progres... right Billbss?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Mine wasn't hit either. It lacked a few pips. I'm still in it.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
mine on northfinance, not hit yet, last swing high 203.73

--- 帖子 #199 ---
It'll move tonight, for better or worse. There's some big news at 4:30 AM EST.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
So even thought we are very close to our TP. I understand changing the system to protect some pips is messig around with the systems principles. But BB?, you dont do anything like that at all, and just let it ride out. It would be a good trade gone bad. A wise mentor once told me to protect your profits by moving yout Stop Loss. He wasnt a fan of trailing stops though. Any comments? Thank everyone...yes, trade still pending TP on North F.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
This system shows to be profitable, at least it does on the backtest and forward test. The rules that were tested do not include taking profits early or moving stops. If you do that, you are trading a different system. To know whether your new method is profitable, you need to backtest it. It may or may not be.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Profit. I need to do a count, but I think this makes 16W 4L, since January. Someone asked why this system doesn't get more attention. I don't know the answer.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Profit too.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
yap, another winner.. good news from GB saved ours trade and about moving stoploss - I say !NO!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
because the guy who started this thread (its me )doesnt have enough time to update this thread,thats why this is kinda set and forget thing..but i'm following this thread and all i can say is someone (like billbss) can modify and start a new thread based on this...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi nomask, nice to see you back on your thread... I don't think we need start new thread.. we tried keep this system alive and looks like we got some success... and also the system looks profitable... thanks for starting this thread..

--- 帖子 #207 ---
to be honest..yes i started this thread but so many smart guys improved this method and now i'm following that system through their improvements...thx everybody...

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi fellow traders !!! Is anyone working with this system in a live account? I must say that many weeks the system has failed in my live, but won in the demo, even in the backtest. I'm following the rules of harold4x.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I've been trading it live since January. It hasn't failed me.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
and it's possible get this improvements from you??

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Anyone using the EA for this system that was posted 3/17... the weekendBOexpert?? Thanks, Myke.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I'm not. I can't see using an EA for one trade a week. Can you?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
This system was posted at the end of January, and your been trading it live since January?. I think it's a little strange.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Normally no, but the market opens here Sun at around 2 PM and I am usually away doing something so I miss the first opening moves. I am unable to setup the trades til later. An EA would be helpful then.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Yes. I've been trading it live since January. I have no control over what you think is strange. That's up to you.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
according to billbss post #173 my entry with northfinance chart H=204.32 L=202.59 With a 7 pip spread: Buy at 204.40 1 pip above the H + spread. Sell at 202.58 1 pip below the L. Range=182 pips. BUY=204.40/ SL=202.58/ PT=206.22 SELL=202.58/ SL=204.40/ PT=200.76 is this correct bill ?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I calculated 9 pips spread.. with 7 pips spread you should have: BUY=204.40/ SL=202.57 / TP=206.23 SELL=202.57 / SL=204.40/ PT=200.74

--- 帖子 #220 ---
That's what I get.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hey, guys. Just noticed this thread. Interesting system. I had a couple questions if anyone would care to answer: 1) I see there have been several modifications to the original method. Are these all collected somewhere or has the first post perhaps been updated with all of the changes? 2) Does this only work on the GBPJPY or perhaps other pairs as well? Anyone tested it? 3) What's the total number of losing weeks in a row so far for 2007? Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #222 ---

My TP has been hit using alpari data, finally broke out of its tight range today! alex

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Another win. I came within 1 pip of being stopped out. It turned and went my way. That's 18-4 since January.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This system was created on 21/01/2008. (17 weeks). How is it possible that you have 22 trades?. I have more than 3 years in the forex and I have visited many similar threads, in which some people write false results. I think that with this process, your not going to win anything and you do lose a lot of people, especially newbie starting in the forex. I just want a bit of seriousness because for many of us this is not a game but a job.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Honeymoney, This system sometimes has 2 trades a week. The version billbss is trading means if his first SL is hit he opens a trade in the opposite direction, with double TP. So it is totally possible for him to have 22 trades. I personally think he is reporting the truth, he has no reason to lie and a look at my NF charts has confirmed this. Im sure there may be some people who fabricate results but billbss isnt. Alex

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Why should Billbss tell lie? Is he selling something. No. He is helping us.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
He has helped anyone that have asked him in a nice way. If he had read the whole thread, he would know the wins and loses and the weeks if he had kept up with the thread. Thanks for the system and who ever contributes the insights to make it work. Even though if it is a lost, i am not there to double the entry. Wonder what if we could put the double lot in after the trade has triggered. Any thoughts. I had a winning week. so hope you all did as well.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Don't be lazy and backtest every week since january.. bilbss wrote that he lost counting.. but I am watching this thread for long time and know, that billbss tried to help, not to lie...so take it easy and have nice weekend..

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Can anyone please place the buy and sell entry orders for the coming week?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
First off, billbss did not create this method /thread. Why would he post wrong results to keep up the interest of others on this thread. He has been very consistent with using this system and the results are pretty accurate. TS

--- 帖子 #233 ---
sell 204.12 SL 205.16 TP 203.08 buy 205.16 SL 204.12 TP 206.20 anybody can confirm?? godd luck

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I didn't do it the way you did. The original High and Low from Friday's last two bars was: H= 202.09 L=204.13 Since that is less than 100 pips, I included the third bar back. The new H/L is: H= 205.51 L= 204.13 Accounting for the 1 pip buffers and the spread, that gives: BUY= 205.61 SELL = 204.12 That's what I did. Your way may be more correct.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
why is the buy values plus spread differs by 10 pips but the sell value by 1 pip only. Sorry for not seeing the obvious.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
The prices shown on your chart are the Bid prices. When you execute a sell, you are selling at Bid price. When you execute a Buy. you are buying at Ask price. The Ask price = Bid price + spread. If you want to buy at 1 tick above a certain price which is shown on your chart, you must put in your order for that price + spread. That is the corresponding Ask price. I hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I got you and thank AGAIN Billbss for being helpful. It really build confidence seeing you make money with this system.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi billbss, I am using original nomask rules.. the 100 pips rule is optimized by biqricky... so i tried to stick with original rules... but I think no matter.. my chanel is 104 pips wide, less then yours, but I got probablly biger lot size... good trading week to everybody.. M.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi folks If you really believe in and follow the Billbss and Harold version of "Weekly GBPJPY Breakout system", here is the MS Excel Template for the price calulation. This is a plug &amp; play template. Simply type your previous week High and Low prices in green and orange boxes, respectively, and you will get Buy/Sell, S/L and T/P prices. Hopefully it will help you to open the Buy and Sell pending orders quickly. With regards,

--- 帖子 #240 ---
How do i long the file in my MT4?kindly direct me.pls

--- 帖子 #241 ---
You can not export the Excel Template to MT4 platform. You will take the Buy/Sell, S/L, and T/P numbers from the template and type these mumbers one-by-one manually into the Order window on MT4 platform to open your Buy Stop and Sell Stop pending orders.

Interesting post Pino http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif . LOL. The trend is always your friend but timing is not. That's why you have to pay close attention to it and measure your risks factor in your analysis and trade management. Have a great day

For example, what do these instructions mean? 1) " stop loss at the out of break out" 2) "when the price hits stop loss in a way our we increase target profit x3 stop loss in opposite direction..." Huh? If anyone can possibly misinterpret directions, then I am your Man! How does the Memorial Day Holiday impact trading this system for this week? Could someone please provide the correct settings? Many thanks, Bob

TP hit today... another winner

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Yes, me too hit TP today. Thanks to Nomask and Harold for the startegy and thanks to Billbss for helping to clarify things here.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
YES, another win, buy stop 205.16, TP 206.20 .. for me 3 W - No Lost 50 more and first MILLION is here..

--- 帖子 #247 ---
My TP hit to, thats 2 wins. Lets hope it keeps it up! Alex

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Yep, same for me. Hope it continues for a long time.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
how has this system performed?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I think Billbss is doing very well with it. I just started it.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
billbss got 16W and 3L i think.... but if you read the thread, you will find the answer.. to alexwaller and Eureka: what was your setting for buy?? (SL, TP, entry)

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Buy - 205.61 S/L - 204.12 TP - 206.99

--- 帖子 #253 ---
205.16, right? so you used harold third 4H bar, correct?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
205.61 Not 205.16. Actually, I used the entries that Billbss posted a few posts back.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi mate, I use alpari so just use there last two 4hr bars with a 5 pip buffer. Entry 205.21 (includin spread) TP 206.41 SL 204.08 I also had a pending order should this have lost to sell with double the TP. Alex

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I have just checked my NF charts, I can see why billbss had a 204.61 entry, its because the last 2 4hr bars didnt total to more than a hundred pips, so he went back another bar which had a high of 205.51. There is a few different variations and i believe this is one of them. Alex

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Can anyone please place the buy and sell entry orders for the coming week?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I, too, would appreciate someone providing this coming week's Buy/Sell, SL and TP entires to verify I am doing this correctly. Are we all using the same broker...IBFX, NorthFinance or FXDD? Much appreciated! Bob in Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #259 ---
use gupta pramod weekly breakout excel template in post 239 page 16, so u can calculate the entry on your own rather than waiting for someone's else calculation

--- 帖子 #260 ---
It's not a matter of calculation, I can do it myself, it's only I just want to confirm the high and low for the week, I'm trying this system since the begining of this year. I'm using 1x target, if one side won, I don't enter the other side. If one side lost I enter the other side with 1x target as well. (This will be a BE week) I had 3 BE weeks b4.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Are we use 4H or last week high, low as input? Thanks

--- 帖子 #262 ---
The last 2 4H candles, the range must be at least 100 pips, if not try to use the last 3 4H candles instead.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
the gy is the highest close after touching this resistance line! If it breaks through it's 214 area then 217.00 area. 208.78 was touched with bullish candles. Still bullish...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
high the one before last 4h candle- low for last 4h candle?

North Finance chart HIGH 209.34 LOW 207.90 BUY STOP: 209.42 SL 207.89 TP 210.95 (7pips spread + 1 pip) SELL STOP 207.89 SL 209.42 TP 206.36 (1 pip)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I'm using FXCM , market closed @ 208.84, high = 208.94 low = 207.89, this means prices in FXCM didn't reach 209, this is strange!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I follow this advice from Harold and Billbss... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=34 they use North finance..

--- 帖子 #268 ---
high and low from last 2 4h candles.... just go couple pages back and you can see my setups....

--- 帖子 #269 ---
here is the chart... high + 8 pips - 209.42 low - 1 pip - 207.89

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I still don't know which figure is correct mine which is 208.94 or the one posted here 209.34 As I mentioned high of the day was 208.94, and high of the last 2 candles was 208.94 as well, which means 209 wasn't reached

--- 帖子 #271 ---
just read this link.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=34

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Pino, I use FXCM also and my friday high on the 4h chart was 209.34. I am eastern standard time.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Sorry Pino, I meant North Finance. FXCM did have a high of 208.89, but they close at 4pm EST on Friday's. North Finance MT4 charts go to 5pm EST and that last hour the price went as high as 209.34.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Has opened on NF ( fxpro ) and gapped alot lower. Im not gonna trade this system when this happens.

Yeah by the time alpari opened the gap has been closed to within my range, +144! Thats 3 out of 3, none have even gone to the 2nd entry order yet!

Good Morn'in y'all, billbss: What is your current win/loss ratio with this system? I have followed your commentary on several other threads, and you seem to readily cut through the BS to determine whether a particular strategy is viable or not. Are you also profitably trading any other systems that you can recommend? ikacek: Are you a displaced Badger fan? I'd love to have a good friend to visit in Tampa when the winters here turn frigid! LOL

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hey Bill, I have also been trading isydeb's grid hedge, an adaptation of dreamliner's and Elijah's strategies. Just like my plan to live forever...so far, so good! LOL 7 wins no losses. I still don't like the total drawdown (DD) with these systems, so I am actually using the strategy to scalp profits. I know their systems were not designed that way, but apparently this methodology lends itself to scalping. I hope I have not drawn away from the main premise of this thread, I will henceforth stay with the theme. bilbss...thanks for all you do to help the rest of us!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I also had a win on my live account today. I agree that Billbss is a very helpful individual. I've seen many different threads where he was there to answer questions and help to clarify the rules of a system. Thanks, Bill.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
This is using harold4x rules + bigricky's rule of going for 2x the range after a stop out. Taking the range from NF and trading with IBFX. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...45&amp;postcount=9 21 winning weeks and 2 losing weeks, since the 1st of this year. A losing week is 2 losses. That makes 21W - 4L since the 1st. Since the system was posted: 18 W weeks - 2 L weeks 18W - 4L trades since the system was posted. I have not taken every trade. There were a couple of weeks that price had gapped and didn't return to within the range, before hitting the TP.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I trade a daily commercial system called "_" that is profitable. I've had it for years and don't know if it's sold any more. I also trade the Cowabunga system on the G/U. I trade it at times. It requires staying up all night and nursing the trades. It's profitable, but I have not kept stats on it. It's on another forum. I don't want to advertise other forums, but you can find it if you look. It shows the running statistics of the system. EDIT: I found out the system I mentioned in the first paragraph is being sold. I'm going to remove it's name. I don't want any hint that I'm spamming it.

Hi, I am from Czech republic, live here for 6 years... love it here, except summer time (way too hot) ..

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Has anyone attempted to trade this strategy on currency pairs other than GBP/JPY? Past experience indicates GBP/USD might be a winner. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I haven't. I'm sitting here wondering why this wouldn't work on a daily basis. Use the last 2 4H bars before 0GMT. That needs to be backtested. I'll do it, if I get the time.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Bill...my thoughts exactly. More power to you! BTW, I quickly looked at GBP/USD for the Friday,s settings, and it would have been profitable, as well. However, I prefer your idea of working this on a daily basis. In the past three years, the only consistant way of trading for me has been some sort of breakout straddle...mostly Asian market Hi/Lo heading into the Frankfurt, and subsequent London markets. There are a thousand different ways to straddle trade, but none have met with the high degree of success that you have achieved. I trade with Oanda , so it will be easy for me to follow your idea with a penny per pip. I like that better than a demo account, because even though the trading amount is miniscule, it is still a live trading platform, and even a small pittance makes it more interesting for me to trade.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
First I Say "Hello" to all.Sorry for my Englissh,but it`s not my natural language. I come from Germany and do my Trades with ABN-AMRO. Thats the same as Oanda Platform. I have read all Posts about this Sytem but one Answer I miss. Spread in the Night is 12Pips and go Down 6:00 GMT (8:00 Germany) to 6 Pips. Which Pips i need to calculated . Although I stay Home for 2 Month because I have an Accident. I would make a Backtest for the 6 Major Pairs and would post them here if interessed From 2003 -2007 Thanks for Answer Icemaan

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Since you do not know when the breakout will come, I would average the spreads and set it for 9. It won't make a lot of difference.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hey Bill, Since I started trading this breakout system on a daily basis, I have 2 profitable days and no losses so far. I have been calculating my box from North Finance charts, but trading from my live account with Oanda. The NF Hi was 205.82 The NF Lo was 204.52 Range = 133 pips The Oanda Hi was 205.91 The Oanda Lo was 204.51 Range = 140 pips Do you think I am better served by using Oanda's box numbers since I am actively placing my trades with Oanda? Or do you think it's still better to take my Buy/Sell entry points from the NF charts? Blessings! Bob

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Point of clarification...Oanda has 3 Hr time frames but no 4 Hr time frames, so I simply take 8 (1 hour) candles for my calculation. I do the same for North Finance.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
It probably won't matter. I've been taking the range from NF because that's what harold backtested. If you take it from Oanda, be sure the times match the last two 4H from NF. Oanda might close earlier or later.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi When I take the Range of Northfinance from last Week then normaly not can make a Trade this Week The Gap is below the Range. Is this correct When i Take the last two Bars from ODL the Range is &lt; 100 so i Take 3 Bars Then the Gap is between the Range and the Trade was perfect on Monday Have everone Backtested with ODL Icemaan

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I trade IBFX and use NF for the entry points. There have only been 2 occasions this year that a trade was not possible because of a gap. It has gapped several times, but has returned to the range and allowed orders to be placed. Twice it didn't return and went on to hit the TP.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I place my trade just before market close on Friday

--- 帖子 #298 ---
"Beware the Ides of March!" Ok...so it's not March, but the NFP news is nearly upon us. As such, I am not trading, today. My weekly breakout trade was profitable as well as my three subsequent daily trades...so I am a happy camper. It would be nice to hear how others are faring with trading this breakout system. How about you lurkers out there?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Can anyone please place the buy and sell entry orders for the next week?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Bill, please correct me if I am wrong. My NF chart shows Friday's two candles with a Hi of 207.88 and a Lo of 206.64. The range is 124 pips, that qualifies because the range is more than 100 pips. Adding a spread of 9 pips, plus 1 pip at the top and -1 pip at the bottom, the entries should be limit orders as follows: Buy 207.98 SL 206.63 TP 209.33 Sell 206.63 SL 207.98 TP 205.28

--- 帖子 #301 ---
That's what I have. We may have a gap Sunday evening. If we do, I'll wait until price retraces back into the range (if it does), before placing my orders. PS- You're calling them limit orders. You must trade with Oanda . To every other broker thay would be stop orders.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I just realise NF is sold to FxPro .com. Do their data looks the same? Someone please verify (you can't dl NF MT4 now) http://www.northfinance.com/

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yeah i use NF, but it is now FxPro, everything still appears to be the same. Anyone who had an NF account automatically had it transferred over to FxPro. Alex

--- 帖子 #304 ---
We may have a gap Sunday evening. Hi Billbss Are you expecting Gap UP or DOWN on Sunday? With regards,

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Gap down. It closed Friday at the bottom of the candle.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Strange! I'm using FXCM , high = 208.08, low = 206.70 So, Buy = 208.18 TP = 209.67 SL = 206.69 Sell = 206.69 TP = 205.20 SL = 208.18 Which figures to use, yours or mine?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
It's not really strange. Different brokers start their 4H bars at different times and they close at different times on Fridays. I use the figures from NF. I use them because those were the numbers harold used in his backtest. It may not matter, but it's very easy to do it the same way he did.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
The platform we will be using until August seems to be the same and on the same North Finance server. In the communication they sent they stated that the update of the platform would be effectively done at that time, and thus meanwhile we wouldn't "be treated the same as FXPro accounts" (I translate this to: "have the same operating conditions", I guess because their difference in some of the spreads maybe, and the micropips). So by now, we are still on the same NF server. I downloaded a demo platform from FXPro, the data (pairs and such) is the same, but they have micropips (that is, 5 decimals and 3 decimals on prices). Those of you who use EAs will have to take this into account as they won't work on that platform until you change the pip value.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Profit!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I took the short breakout and got stopped out. I've targeted 2x on the long. The long trade is still open.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Bill, I trade with Oanda. With slight chart variations from North Finance, my short was not filled...but I can see where your short was filled. It looks like you made a profit from the Buy?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I'm in profit now, but the trade is still on. I use bigricky's method of doubling my TP if I get stopped out.

Anyone make a daily trade?

Settings for tonight's DAILY trade: BUY 210.08 Stop Loss 208.67 Take Profit 211.49 SELL 208.67 Stop Loss 210.08 Take Profit 207.26 BTW, I started trading live two weeks ago. The weekly trades were both winners...the three daily trades I made were also winners. Godd trading y'all! Bob from Southern Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #316 ---
What are your rules for your daily trade? How do you find the range? Thanks

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Bill...that's funny! I'm following your recommendations! LOL

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Ok...I used some discretion and manually closed out my daily trade for a 30 pip profit...so in2 weeks I have had all wins. This thread seems to have died an unseamly death. Too bad, because the strategy has been profitable for me. This is my last post unless someone provides some feedback. Blessings!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi bobcat, Some feedback on what? If you mean the daily trade i didnt even know it existed. The weekly one i have been foloowing for 4 weeks now and had all winners! It looks very promising to me but time will tell. I think part of the reason this thread is quite quiet is probably because there is only 1 or sometimes 2 trades at the beginning of the week. I cant understand why else it would be so quiet - billbss results so far are bloody good, and everyone elses are to. Im definately going to continue to test this on my live micro account. Alex

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Sorry but can't seem to find what the rules are for the daily trades, can you please share? On the weekly trades I've had all winners since starting with this, and it seems like a great system for the geppy, and I will continue with it, after all who can say no to great pips?! I dont think the thread is dying but the weekly breakout is good as it is and dont need improvements (obviously) so thats why not so many are posting I think, now maybe we could look at the daily if you you would like to share? EDIT: found the rules, use the last two H4 bars before 0GMT. So because the last 2 hours are less than 100 pips range you use the last 3 bars? Doing that gives me the same entries as you have written. Will demo this and share here.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi, I'm following this system for a few weeks now, and after the good results I got live on monday. I waited for the gap close on monday before I placed my trades. There isn't much to say during the week, looks like trades are finished every monday with good results. I really want to thank all the contributors to this thread. It helped me a lot to build up confidence. LiT

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I closed out my last night's "daily" trade @ BreakEven. No win, but more importantly...no loss. I have yet to lose since I started trading this way over the past two weeks or so. Admittedly, part of my trading was discretionary. I took profit on a few of the daily trades after fairly short gains. Most of the time, my meddling with the "rules" cost me even more profits. Over the past 4 years of live trading, the only true success I have achieved has been trading some form of a straddle on the price. Although we are trading a breakout system, it is also a straddle. This is great because it is impossible to anticipate with any real degree of success, the direction price will take in even the very next second. With this system in place, we don't care which direction price takes. It is great to take 5 minutes to calculate entry points and place pending trades. Wake up the next morning and count my profits! The only thing easier is teaching my dog to do the entries for me! LOL Great trading my friends!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Bob, why don't you start a thread on the daily method? I'll contribute to it as I'm sure others will. We can backtest and optimize the rules- times, minimum ranges, when to close if the trade isn't complete...etc. PS- Here's another breakout method that looks good. I've been going over the charts on it. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=91559

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I also tried some daily trades, because of the small size of my account and after some research I started with EUR/USD. Rules are nearly the same except the smaller range I'm looking for a 50 pips range there. For this week, from Tue to Thur all have been winners, Friday trade has been break even (first hitting the buy trigger got stopped out then triggered sell and took profit) I would also be interested on a thread for daily trades (if not bound to gbp/jpy only) pips with you LiF

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Can anyone please place the buy and sell entry orders for the coming week I have an account with FXCM : High = 210.71 (last 2 4h candles) Low = 210.28 (last 2 4h candles) which means that the range didn't reach 100 pips so I used the 3rd last 4h candles which gave me a low of 209.92 This means that we still didn't get 100 pips range In north finance here is the figures: High = 210.95 Low = 209.97 This means we didn't reach 100 pips range as well. So I used the 3rd last 4h candle which gave me 209.99 This means that we still didn't get 100 pips range What a strange week!! I'm confused what to do and which figures to use

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I got different numbers from North Finance than you did. After going back three bars: H=210.88 L=209.94 That's is 6 less than 100. Add 3 pips to the H Subtract 3 pips from the L, that will make the range 100. H=210.91 L=209.91 Now do your +-1 pip and add the spread to the H. For a 9 pip spread: BUY= 211.01 SELL= 209.90

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks billbss for the great help

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Profit. That's 23 winning weeks and 2 losing weeks this year.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Yes another great week with this system. I have a small suggestion regarding money management that I have implemented lately. I'll close 2/3 of my position after half the TP and let the reamining 1/3 run (with the initial SL). 2 things can happen: 1) I get stopped out and the win for that week will be 1/3 of the opened position (I always consider % and never pips). 2) It'll run to next week. If it was a buy, the new stoploss will be the new weeks low, and vice versa. So if the new week also opens a buy, the 1/3 from last week will keep running this week and will keep accumulate profits. If the new week trend is opposite last weeks trend then I'll get stopped out with some profits as well. This is good in cutting the losses short and letting the profits ride. For example the week that started 12 May had a buy, next week had a buy, and the next week as well. By keeping 1/3 from the those weeks you would have gained even more profits. They were all stopped out at the beginning of the 4th week. Now this system is so good that I'm even considering closing 1/2 at the TP (which would mean that I'll get a BE trade if turns against me after reaching TP) and letting the other 1/2 ride like above, and this will give even more profits.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I wish you luck with it. It may work out better than the original rules. I don't scale out on any system. I know it's a popular thing to do. Almost every method on this board uses some type of scale out on profit taking. My thinking is this: On every system there is an optimal exit point. That is where we should exit. With this method, for example, if the optimal point is 1:1 that's where we need to get out, with the entire trade. If it is not the best time to exit, we shouldn't exit with any portion of the trade at this point. If it is optimal to let a winning trade run until x time, that's what we need to do, with the entire trade. If not, then none of it. I've seen a number of computer runs on exit methods. Taking partial profits at various stages of a trade always hurts your overall profits.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I see your point and wish you all the luck as well .

Profit. 3 Weekly wins...no losses to date. I will be trading this daily for the rest of the week. Since the daily version is largely untested, I only trade 10% of the amount that I trade weekly.

Can anyone please post the buy and sell orders for the coming week?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi Pino, Here are the entries from North Finance for the week of 6-22-08 1. The (2) 4 Hour Candles Hi and Lo have a range of 92 pips. Therefore, we have to add the 3rd Candle for the proper settings. 2. High = 212.87 3. Low = 211.70 4. Range = 117 pips 5. Dealer Spread = 9 pips Therefore the pending orders for the week are the following: BUY = 212.97 Stop Loss = 211.69 Take Profit = 214.25 SELL = 211.69 Stop Loss = 212.97 Take Profit = 210.41 Bill, please confirm these entries. I don't want to misinform anyone. And...have a great weekend! Bob

--- 帖子 #337 ---

I started reading your method yesterday. Congratulations, it looks like a winner. I do have a question, though. If I'm understanding your method correctly you're adding the spread to your long entry price plus one pip, correct? For some reason that seems odd to me. I would think you'd want to add the spread to your TP. That way you're in your long trade sooner and the spread gets covered in your long profits. Am I wrong in my thinking or is there something I fundamentally misunderstand about trading in general?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
It isn't my method. Nomask is the originator of it. I'll try to answer your question though. If you look at a chart, the bars you see are the BID price. The bid price is what you sell at- always. You buy at the ASK price. The difference between the bid and ask price = the spread for that particular pair. The ask price is always greater than the bid price. If the chart shows a price of 212.00 that is bid price. If the spread on the pair is 7 pips, then the corresponding ask price is 212.07. Let's say I'm looking at a chart. I have decided to buy 1 pip above the high of a bar. My spread is 7 pips. The charted High of the bar I want to buy 1 pip above is 212.54. = bid The corresponding ask price for 212.54 is 212.61. (212.54+7) I add 1 to it and place my BUY STOP order for 212.62. You don't need to figure in the spread for a sell order. You always sell at the bid price, which matches the chart prices. I hope that made sense.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Bill, Yep...family man, too. 5 children and 3 grandchildren. Coincidentally, my eldest son and wife just moved to "Frisco" (not certain of the spelling) on the north side of Dallas. Both he and his wife are praise and worship musicians, but are pursuing other livelihoods for the moment. We are located right on the Mississippi River, and have thankfully been spared from the terrible flooding devastation taking place in our neighboring state of Iowa. Destruction in the BILLIONS! These folks need our prayers! Many have lost everything, and most are without flood insurance. Makes me wonder why we are rebuilding Now Orleans at its old location which is BELOW the level of the Mississippi River? Yes, we need to help those unfortunate victims...but it seems we are reinviting a future disaster. Almost as ill-conceived as our self-imposed ban on drilling for oil and oil shale extraction...all the while our economy goes deeper and deeper in the crapper as our dependence on foreign oil worsens. I apologize for promoting my views on this thread...really unwarranted, but I am mad as H***, and I'm not going to take it anymore! Sorry my friends...I hope to return to sanity at the beginning of the week! LOL Blessings!

Bill, thanks for the explanation.

I know Frisco well. It used to be named Lolaville. It was a little wide place in the road not too many years ago. It's really booming now. Those floods are terrible. I feel sorry for those people. I read that whole towns were destroyed. I am praying for them. I agree with just about everything you said. You're a good man to be as mindful of our problems as you are. Have a great weekend, Bill

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Great thread everyone. I have a question about the weekend gap. How do you trade this if price is above or below the breakout channel when the market opens Sunday? Do you take a trade as soon as the price hits either side? Bill, That is a very good trade record. Do you limit your trades to only 2 stop outs per week? Thanks, Lcfx

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Weekend gaps- I will wait to see if price comes back to the channel. If it does I will place my orders. If it gaps and hits what was to have been the TP, I consider it a trade I was too late to get in on and forget it until next week. Two stop outs a week, is all.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
By how many pips does it need to return back into the channel before the orders are valid? On the MM side, are you adjusting the position size that your risk is 2% for each trade?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
It needs to return by any amount at all- 1 pip. If it's 1 pip back in the channel and breaks out again, that's a trade. I do 1% each side. The most I can lose on the whole deal is 2%. If the performance continues at the present rate, I'm going to increase it to a total of 3 or 4%.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Yes. I do live in Nashville.

Hi everybody, I have been banned for 2 weeks, but right now I am back.. so this week setup: Buy : 212.72 SL: 211.69 TP: 213.75 Sell: 211.69 SL: 212.72 TP: 210.66 Hope its right.... Billbss, thanks for your daily breakout thread...

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hey, I've been wondering where you've been. Good to see you back. These are the numbers from NF. BUY = 212.97 Stop Loss = 211.69 Take Profit = 214.25 SELL = 211.69 Stop Loss = 212.97 Take Profit = 210.41

--- 帖子 #355 ---
On my Alpari Demo I got the same numbers. If someone uses Alpari I found that I have to take h/l from the last 7bars on 1H Timeframe instead of the last 2 on 4H. This week I used high/low for the last 11 hours before closing to get the range &gt; 100. LiF

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi all, I try to modify the original rule and get the very good result after backtesting from Jan year 2008. I love this FF forum because all the people here willing to help each orther. of course i also learn alot from FF. That why i want sharing my own rule with your guys TF = 1H find the last three bar hi/low (bid price) value when the market price closed on friday. Buy entry signal = hi price + 50pip Sell entry signal = low price - 50pip Tp = 150pip S/L = 100pip for week 24 june 2008, buy signal = 212.63, T/P = 214.13, S/L = 211.63 Sell signal = 212.20, T/P = 210.70, S/L =213.20 Thanks.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Thank you for sharing this. What are the results of your backtest from January?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
HLAng, Thanks for sharing your system, but I guess that there is something wrong with the figures you posted above. Your buy signal = 212.63 (High + 50 pips which means 212.13 + 50 pips to give us 212.63 and your sell signal = 212.20 (low - 50 pips which means 212.70 - 50 pips to give us 212.20 This means that low price was higher than high price!? Can you please just check this?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Billbss, I see your High and Low is from last 3 4H candles.. I just took 2 4H candles, added spread (10 pips for H, 1 for L) and that is more then 100 pips.. so what you think?? your entry or my entry?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I honestly don't know. I have always made it be 100 before I added the spread and the 2 pips. That was my interpretation of how to do it. I'm not sure it matters and I'm not sure which way is right.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
right now it did trigger short, are you guys in yet? we have news from uk and jp tonite

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I'm in. I've never worried about the news with this system.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Bill, How are you already in? Is the data different for live and demo? The 20:00 candle (IBFX) shows a H:212.21 &amp; L:211.80. Below is your NF data. BUY = 212.97 Stop Loss = 211.69 Take Profit = 214.25 SELL = 211.69 Stop Loss = 212.97 Take Profit = 210.41

--- 帖子 #364 ---
On my IBFX, tonight's first 1H bar looked like this: O = 211.69 H = 212.21 L= 211.68 I was late getting in. I got in at 211.80, because I wasn't watching it. I saw it had hit the breakout and was back in the channel. If I had been watching it I would have entered on the open. I was lucky in that respect.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I missed that.. I just came home.. just setup the entry and will be wait for triger... good luck all

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Billbss, Please refer the attachment file as the result from Jan 2008 until last week. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I closed mine out at a 17 pip loss and reset the orders. I made a mistake by entering. There wasn't actually a breakout. It opened at the breakout point, went down a pip, then turned up. It has never actually crossed the breakout line downwards. Anyway- I payed a little for my mistake.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi, I don't see a file

--- 帖子 #369 ---
the opening was 211.79 and went down to 211.44, i think it did trigger short, your thoughts guys? i am short at 211.95, i enter late

--- 帖子 #370 ---
The opening price of which broker? It wasn't the opening price of my broker. Mine opened it at 211.69 If it did open at 211.79 then it was a short breakout. You're right to be in it.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
ibfx it is mine to.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Here's a chart from my IBFX platform. The white arrow points to the opening bar for Sunday. The yellow horizontal line is at the opening price. 211.69 If you have something different, they are putting out different data to different people, which they may be. We can only trade what we see.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
i know ibfx got to that price, but i thought we look at NF charts and go by that

--- 帖子 #374 ---
We only look at NF charts to get the Friday bars. You trade on your brokers platform.

Hi Bujal, You don't deduct the spread from the sell price in the rules of this system. Are you testing another method?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi billbss, Do you take only one breakout a week? I take one breakout for buy (212.63) and another breakout for sell (211.20) for this week.Even win or lose i will not open new order again. maximum win per week is 300pip. maximum lose per week is -200pip. Do you close Friday if it hasn't hit the TP or SL? yes. Thanks.

Still very much alive, here. It came within about 15 pips of stopping me out, then headed back down. That isn't unusual, I've seen that a lot of times. That's why I want that channel as wide as possible.

Hi all According to the rules in the first post we take that last two candles of friday the previous week. roughly hi 212.73 low 211.69 giving us a sell order triggered @ 211.69 or better if you got in late right? should SL be 212.73 plus spread? and a TP of 209.69 which is roughly 2Xs the SL right? Just not sure where the 210.41 TP came about ive seen mentioned ?? Also if stopped out on the short do we immediatley enter long at the SL for 3Xs the new SL on a buy order? It looks like several variations on the original rules are being used. Which new rules do you find most successfull now? billbss what rules are you currently using? thanks

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Use North Finance chart to gather data. Take the H-L of Friday's last two 4H bars. If it equals &lt; 100, go back another 4H bar. If it is still &lt; 100, add to the H and subtract from the L an equal number of pips to equal a H-L range of 100. Set the Buy Stop to the adjusted H + 1 + spread. Set the Sell stop to the adjusted L - 1. The SL is the other side of the channel. The TP is the amount of the SL. If you are stopped out, set the TP of the new trade to 2x the original SL. Anytime the TP is hit, cancel any existing order. You are through for the week. Close any open position and cancel any existing order a few minutes before your broker closes on Friday.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Great, thanks Bill

--- 帖子 #417 ---
hi bill If it equals &lt; 100, go back another 4H bar. Meaning that we take the last 3 4H bar? if still &lt; 100 ? Lee

--- 帖子 #418 ---
hi bill If it is still &lt; 100, add to the H and subtract from the L an equal number of pips to equal a H-L range of 100. Im not really clear about it

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Let's say that after going back three 4H bars, the range between the highest H and the lowest L, is 90 pips. That is 10 pips short of 100. We would add 5 pips to the H and subtract 5 pips from the L. That would make it 100. Example: H = 212.00 L = 211.10 That's a difference of 90 pips- not enough. We want at least 100. Add 5 to the H H = 212.05 Subtract 5 from the L L = 211.05 Now we have 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thanks bill, looking for testing it. Have a nice day and happy trading

Im stopped out on both trades. My first loosing week.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Yep. Double whammy. That's 23 winning weeks and 3 losing weeks this year. The 3 losing weeks each had 2 losses. So trade wise its 23 W- 6L

06/22/08 - 06/27/08 0W - 1L -4% down

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Can anyone please post the buy and sell orders for the coming week?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Bill, can you post how many pips total gain? thanks, have a nice weekend guys.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I don't measure pips. I measure wins and losses. Each win is +2% of the account and each loss is -2%. I can go back and see the results of compounding since the 1st of the year. I'll try to post that tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
For next week- assuming 9 pip spread. BUY STOP = 212.21 SL = 210.95 TP = 213.47 SELL STOP = 210.95 SL = 212.21 TP = 209.69

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Bill, I notice that on the first trade you set the TP to the size of the channel. Now if your first trade fails will you set the TP for the 2nd trade to 2x the size of the channel? Also, do you risk 1% or 2% per trade?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Yes. If the first trade fails, I set the TP to 2x the channel. I am risking 2%.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
With some variation, I have 1348 pips, since 02/03/08 to the date. A good MM is very important here. We must be prepared for a drawdown. But I hope that this does not happen ever. green pips for all.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
KFX do you mind sharing what those variations are?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
bill, can u post how it calculate...since i cant get the exact result..Thanks

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Taking the last two 4H bars (Friday) from North Finance H= 212.11 L= 210.96 Range = 115 pips. That's &gt;100. We don't have to go back another bar. Add 1 pip + spread(9 pips) to the H for BUY STOP. BUY STOP = 212.21 Subtract 1 pip from the L for SELL STOP. SELL STOP = 210.95 BUY STOP - SELL STOP = 126 pips BUY STOP + 126 = TP (buy) = 213.47 SELL STOP - 126 = TP (sell) = 209.69 So: BUY STOP = 212.21 SL= 210.95 TP = 213.47 SELL STOP = 210.95 SL = 212.21 TP = 209.69

Here's a calculator in Excel I put together. If the channel doesn't equal 100 pips, you will need to add these values into spreadsheet numbers to make it equal 100. If a member knows the formula to add this feature than please do so. I am also attaching a market-value indicator that shows pip value in USD so you can plug this into the mm table.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
hi bill, everebody.. i checked a setup.. look right to me, but i have got right now spread 10 pips (NF).. so can we just make a "RULE" and use since now on 9 pips no matter what...???

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I would use my actual spread. It probably won't make much difference- 1 pip. Whatever you think. Is 10 your normal spread? Usually the spread is more than normal on the Sunday open, to cover gaps. Mine is 10 right now, but it will go back to 9 in an hour or so.

My first entry was a buy - SL hit, My second entry, the sell is still open, came around 60 - 70 pips from tp but has now moved away again. I doubled my TP for the second order, I dont think anyone would have hit TP yet if they done that.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
They wouldn't have, but people are doing different versions of it and taking their numbers from different sources. I'm exactly where you are.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
no....not going to BT. i prefer to wait my own confirmation. just wanna chit chat..thats all

--- 帖子 #452 ---
My reason ist quite simple, I do not have the time/possibility to track the trades the hole day, so I (looks like luckyly) missed to move my TP on the sell so I'm break even for the week.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Ocala, Fl here. Small world!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
yes.. small world...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
ErikGault, your initial stoploss (BUY OERDER) would have been hit and then the sell order would have now been triggered. Your Take Profit should be DOUBLED, so we are ALL still in the trade, im not sure how your out. Anyways....just thought you should trade this strategy as it was designed to be traded or your results will be very different from ours. Thats all mate....

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Thank bill

--- 帖子 #457 ---
do you know why ? it seems i make a mistake.... i don't look at the chart closely, the BUY ORDER don't hit because of my late entry, the price have already move south so it hit the SELL ORDER instead .. and voila it move down to my TP hit... so.. pardon me my friend for not being carefull

--- 帖子 #458 ---

Oh well, this week looks like a looser again... I'm stopped out with my long trade and now the short is -90 pips... Jan

--- 帖子 #472 ---
this damn dragon should make a breakout of this over extended sleep soon and start to trend again, for gods sake. but its soo costly to wait for that breakout. I still have confidence in this strategy, it worked well until 2 weeks ago.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Its looking that way. I was looking back and the last losses were in April. March 30- double stop out April 6 - Win April 13 - Double stop out. That was all since Jan.1 until the last three weeks. Those losses in March and April accounted for a 6% drawdown. If we get stopped out this trade, it will be a 12% drawdown. That isn't much as far as systems go- most profitable methods will have at least a 20% drawdown. I had previously decided that I would suspend trading this system for awhile if it dipped below 12%. If we get stopped out this trade, and the first trade of next week, then I'm going to sit on the sidelines for awhile. I'll wait until it gets back to the 6% range, to start trading it again.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
To all those who do not want to see. Be prepare for the drawdown.

buy hit SL... hmmm.. again.. so bill, what next?? break for couple weeks?? wait for trend?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Yep. That's a 14% drawdown since these loses started. That was my cutoff point. I'll start trading it again if it recovers back to a -6%.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Well our TP short got touched so I recouped half of my losses for this week. I have another open trade which I let free until the end of the week. I think we should give one more chance to this strategy, hopefully GY broke out of that bloody range and start to trend again, hopefully to the down side.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I haven't given up on the strategy. In March and April, when it went through some losses it had a 6% drawdown. I had already decided I would step aside if it ever went down more than twice that. It did that with the last stop out. I'll get back in it if it recovers to the 6% mark. It's already climbed from -14% to -12%. You never know when a system is broke and when it is in a natural lull. Those were the numbers I had decided on. If you stay in it, you may be making the right decision. I'm doing what I had decided upon.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Using alpari data, my short with TP doubled has just been hit! Hopefully have a nice little run of winners again

--- 帖子 #484 ---
ok, this is a good caution strategy. I should employ it as well, but I have to calculate my own drawdown percentage, since I started trading this system only from june. In backtesting, 2008 looks great, 2007 is quite profitable, but 2006 is awful. According to my MM, the strategy produced a negative -2200 pips in 2006, which however were quickly recouped in 2007. So I should be careful with it and see when it will enter in the drawdown period.

large range is for geppy better... but I think this week everybody waiting for friday.... till than no much movement.. IMO

--- 帖子 #492 ---
i'll just throw my two cents out there (in this thread) because its a good a place as any... the problem with timed breakouts is that you don't let the consolidation come to you. you pick a time for the breakout to occur, and if your timing is off, you are stopped out. the way i look at breakouts is to wait for the consolidation to appear first, then risk based on a breakout from the range. possibly more later....

--- 帖子 #493 ---
bill i must say that i disagree with you. i don't believe in a system breaking or having natural tendencies. no two years ever look the same for a pair.... so a system must be able to handle all types of conditions. a year can do well, then a lousy one, and then the 3rd year be spectacular.... was the system ever broken? no.... the market dictated that 2 of the 3 years would be good. it's always in control....

--- 帖子 #494 ---
the gbp/jpy looks dull and boring today although there are other pairs such as eur/usd and gbp/chf performed very well and had a good deal of movements. ok ,its just hard times ,i have to wait till the dull days end

--- 帖子 #495 ---
You may well be right. I know you analyze these things a lot deeper than I do or can do. I believe a system can work for a long period of time, years even, and then stop working and never work again. I don't necessarily believe that about this system, but I think it happens. This system worked (works) because the GBP/JPY has had a tendency to decide on a direction, at the beginning of the week, and move in that same direction a certain percentage of its average daily range, before turning. It did this with enough frequency, that it was a profitable trade. Why? I don't know. I doubt anyone knows. There was something causing this pair to move as I described. It has stopped that pattern of movement for the last 5 weeks, or so. Why? Again, I don't know, because I don't know why it was doing it in the first place. It may resume or it may not. If it doesn't, then this system will no longer be profitable. Should that happen, I would call this method broke. Maybe we agree and just didn't agree on the language to use.

i have just checked and use NF. i got same result with tomomi72003 i think you should doulbe check

--- 帖子 #531 ---
i have double checked it, as i said earlier i use Alpari and those are my figures, my NF demo server seem to be inactive, anyone with similar problem? Am not too confortable with NF figure, cos those figures are actually the high and low of friday, which means the high and low occured occured in the last 8hrs of the day in NF, well i will stick to my Alpari figures for this week Thanks

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Alpari is different because of time zone differences and NF trades for 1 hour longer on a friday than alpari before it closes for the weekend. This makes the last 2 4hr bars different. I wouldnt think this would affect the system that much, and in the long run both would look very similar results wise.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
If my 2 cents matter, a wide channel does makes a difference. People trade this different ways. I still uses the last nf. It has been profitable live. At one time it had a huge set back but i found out that if you stick to this system it can be profitable for you. Not all systems work but this has been for me. Some announcements and news of the world moves the market. Along with price action, support, resistance indicators ect. ect. ect.... People trade in various forms but what ever works. This one did hit the pt this week. Happy pippin

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Yes mate I agree that channel width would make a difference but alpari trades 1 less hr, the difference would be hardly anything most of the time, In my opinion that isnt going to make a massive difference in the long run. I have also been trading this live for quite a while - am profitable and use alpari data.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
This has been a good thread. Even though it has its drawdown periods. As i stated earlier in the thread it can be profitable if you are consistant with it. In the past 2 weeks it has gain over 400 pips. Even though the us news is sometimes worser than expected, this is still forex. Anything can happen. Thats what moves the market. I do trade off the numbers, pullbacks ect..., but i still like the breakout methods. The originator i still give thanks for introducing the system and, everyone else that helped. Sorry for the grammer errors. Im not fussing or complaining, just trying to make the pips. KEEP PIPPIN

--- 帖子 #536 ---
this tread is dying.. why?? everybody start making money and don't have a time to post? I will try keep this thread alive... I will post buy and sell orders from IBFX, i think is not a big difrence ...so Buy order 151.15, SL 142.92, TP 159.38 Sell order 142.92 SL 151.15 TP 134.69 pretty wide range ove 800 pips.. will see what happend.. and don't forgot: MONEY MANAGEMENT make difrence between good and bad traders...

--- 帖子 #537 ---
this method has been very profitable so far, except the awful July drawdown. In the last weeks, if you let 1 lot free until friday, you would have made XXX more pips. The problem with this thread is that it will eventually die, since everyone following this method can calculate the ranges for himself. I dont see any point in posting here the numbers.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
It has been piping pretty good lately but, it will have its drawdowns and you have to be patient for it to work. 800 is a large range but, it has been crazy these lasy few weeks because of the news and unexpected events. Along with the daily system last week I gained over 500 pips. It still can work with money management. Now lets ride it as if it were ike coming through. Ride it out.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Did anyone get at least 700 pips last week with a sell that lost. Then double the lot on the buy. Just curious. The only pips I try on this system now is 250. It still works.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
first i lost (-823 pips), second one I closed on friday about 4 PM (+817) .. this week double lost

Hi! I put on a trade Sunday evening. Sell@145.5 with TP@143.44 and buy@147.7 with TP@149.8. I know that my sell is not exactly according to the rules, but I was afraid of some of the lower lows made on friday. If they are broken I think we'll have a small rally down to at least 143.7x. *** Edit: Profit taken @ 143.44. +206 pips Buy order is cancelled

--- 帖子 #542 ---
limit orders placed: sell@133.19 sl: 137.55 tp: 128.83 buy@137.64 sl: 133.28 tp: 142.00 Of course, the upside is huge if 141 breaks. At least 143 seems like a good target...

--- 帖子 #543 ---
buy limit entered this morning. It looks like a good run. Have moved buy SL to 137.1 with TP 1.43

--- 帖子 #544 ---
My stoploss was hit at 00:52 CET last night with -54 pips. I moved the stoploss although its not a part of the system. However, it turned out that the breakout Monday morning didn't sustain. So basically I think it was the correct choice even though a lost a few pips.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
is this thread still alive. I have made a few changes and it still works if you make it. I just changed my tp and it seems to work fine here lately.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hi Smurf, Please share your new settings...I have always liked this thread. Thanks, Bob

--- 帖子 #547 ---
The only thing that i do: if the range is more than 250, my pip limit is 150. If i am watching the trade And it gets 50 pip up, i move my stoploss to break even. Then if im still watch it, i will put a trailing stop on it. It seems to work for me. My hi-lo&gt; fxcm hi-133.36 lo-131.26 these are the numbers that i work off of this week.

Hi Everyone. I discovered this system and have been studying it. It appears to work so I am going to trade with it this week. I currently trade a small account live (successfully) and think this should give me more scope in my trading. Many thanks for all your advise.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
This system is still profitable. But it has i'ts moments. As they say it is a beast. Enter with caution and by all means enter with caution.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
what is your entry strategies for todays play??

--- 帖子 #555 ---
This is a weekly system. The same rules from 1st post. The only difference i use is that if the range is under 100, I dont trade. I use friday's 7-14 candle to find the hi-lo. And I only try for 150. Depend on the market i might use a trailing stop after i reach 100. The same system with variations. Just make it work for you. Right now we are in a sell lets ride it out and see. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Lost the buy this week. Well, we'll try it next week. Consistantcy is how you trade this system.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
+150 on the sell for the week.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hi Smurf Nice result- I placed my buy/sell orders on Friday evening before the weekly close ( close enough not to risk a change in the parameters) and took +150 on the sell. I cancelled the buy. ( demo account only) I trade a separate breakout system on a live account but am wanting to "widen my net" to embrace another system. This looks ideal-I particularly like the consistent stop loss and target each week, which may not suit everyone's style but fits with my attitude towards trading. My view of systems like this is that as long there is consistency week in week out they can work,and produce overall profit. This thread has gone quiet- there are a lot on FF like this- most "systems" work some of the time but a lot of people just expect too much of them and expect them to work all of the time. Sometimes threads go quiet because the simplicity of them is easy to understand and to implement and they are quietly followed in the background by successful traders. I have back tested your 150 target and stop loss and the results going back into last year seem pretty good. Whats your experience of trading this approach? Have you found it consistent? thanks in advance Mark

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I have traded this system consistantly and some weeks you will get 2 or three loses in a row. I dont recommend putting a trade in before the market closes because it could gap before it closes. I would wait untill the market open. If i miss the boat there's next week. Somewhere in the thread i read if it has taken off and comes back to the channell, then i could put the trade in, which i have done before. I wish i could monitor the trade. I sometimes use a trailing stop if i am watching it and can lock in 100 pip profit. Usually the trade is done by tuesday or wensday. One week it wasnt through untill thursday. I like to trade breakout systems. This and other daily systems can work. And expect the losing weeks. The rules on the first page makes this a good system. I had to change a few things to make it work for me. I did not change the system just altered it to where it could work for me. Consistancy is the key. Is anyone else still trading this system?

Hi. This week wee have an close at the high. From my experience with stocks, I have an rule that we can also aply to this system. “If we close at th high/low, than for the next oppening hours don’t go in the direction of the previous candle.” (because many traders/investors are not active in the last hours on Friday, so they must consolidate all positions !!!) So I did some manual backtest on GJ from Jan 08. During this time we have 9 closes at high/low: -3 huge gapps, no trade -1 fake on both brkout sides -2 fakes in the direction of the prevoius candle. Profitable in the opposite directon of the previous candle. -3 profitable trades according to the rules of this system. All three trade are in the opposite directon of the previous candle. We had two times losses with SL. If we apply my rule to not oppening the trade in the direction of the previous candle, we would have 5 profitable trades and only 1 trade with loss SL. 03.03.2008 fake on both brkout sides 17.03.2008 Big gap, no trade 14.04.2008 fake in the direction of the prevoius candle. Profitable in the opposite directon of the previous candle. 02.06.2008 No fake. Profitable in the opposite directon of the previous candle. 16.06.2008 No fake. Profitable in the opposite directon of the previous candle. 21.07.2008 fake in the direction of the prevoius candle. Profitable in the opposite directon of the previous candle. 01.09.2008 Big gap, no trade 22.09.2008 Big gap, no trade 02.02.2009 No fake. Profitable in the opposite directon of the previous candle.

Did any one get 150 pips this week? What did you get and what range did you use. I have learn not to trade after holidays on this weekly system. Last tear it killed me! It was a small range this week but, i still got the 150 pips. Very tight very close.

Maybe my question was not clear enough What I ment is the entry levels Buy &amp; Sell how do you calculate them? By hand or using a spreadsheet. Because I am finding it difficult to calculate the proper entry levels. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
The way that i Calculate is whatever the high is i add 13 to the high to get the buy. My rang is always 150.That is what i am use to using. What ever the low is i still subtract 1 to get the sell. I still use the original rules. The only thing i do different, i use a 150 range. Some people use 50 some 100. What ever the range is that is my limit and stop loss. I do it all by hand.

Smurf, Any history or backtesting this with doubling your lots on trade #2?

Hellow Mikeh3855, I do not recomend doubling up. I am using this strategy in a live account. FXCM. Still going through the thing of stop loss and limit orders on the trading station. I had to do it by hand. Have to figure it out how to do it. I dont know how to use EA, and how to load things on my chart. Back to the question; Any history or backtesting this with doubling your lots on trade #2? If you read through the thread it talks about it. This was the second time i doubled my lot size since trading it live. So i have no history. Still tring to figure out what works. I have done no backtesting. I can only go by what i have done in foward testing in a demo and live account since August. Does it have drawdown periods, sure it has. All systems has. Like some of the other breakout strats it has thier drawdowns but that is part of trading. I just try to wither the storms by toughing it out with MM. Some of the answers lie in the daily thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/misc/paperclip.gif Daily GBP/JPY Breakout System billbss I hope i have answered your questions. If not let me know. Happy pipping.

Hi-154.62 lo-152.38 range-224 fxcm going to bed now. Cant stay focus.

Yes Smurf, I'm trading it. I'm up 107 or so. It was higher but retracing some now. In the interest of money management I've brought the stoploss on trade one to breakeven. I'll leave trade two in place in case it reverses this week. Good luck!

It might break through the resistance with a pull back. +150 on the buy. Will try it again next week.

Would anyone care to share their win rate and number of trades performed? thanks, Walt

I can't give you the exact trades, but one week made 350+ pips, last week was break even, and this week, I finally ran the EA I wrote, and broke even by accident. All in all not too bad. Weeks like this one are tough, and because I set up the take profit at 1X I luckily broke even. Had I not done that, I'd be at one loss, and negative on the 2nd trade of the week. Also, my hours are different, per the original description, starting at 00:00 GMT. Ron(ForexMT4)

Hello everyone I stumbled upon this thread these days . This thread seems dead but it seems interesting ... maybe because there was not much more to add. I wonder if it still works . I ask because it seems that north finance has disappeared ( I 'm not someone tell me something about ? ) . So my question is, someone is still using ? with which broker ? thank
