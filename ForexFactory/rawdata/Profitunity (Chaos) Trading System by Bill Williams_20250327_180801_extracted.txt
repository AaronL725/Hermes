Hello traders,

I recently found out chaos system and read the books about it (by Bill Williams). I was convinced by the reading I tried the system for a while...

I seems worthable for me and I didn't find discussions here about this trading system and here it is:

Profitunity System

On the chart apply following tools
Alligator - Three SMAs (13/8/5) with a future offset of 8/5/3 respactively.
Fractals  - 5 bars sequence where middle one has highest High / lowest Low and its preceded and followed two bars have lower highs / higher lows

preceded by two lower highs and is followed by two lower highs
Awesome Oscillator (AO) - difference between the 34-period and 5-period simple moving averages of the bar's midpoints (H+L)/2
Acceleration Oscillator (AC) - difference between 5/34 momentum histogram (AO) and a 5-bar simple moving average on the AO

To apply then into MetaTrader 4 platform use these menus
Alligator:  Insert -> Indicators -> Bill Williams –> Alligator
Fractals:   Insert -> Indicators -> Bill Williams –> Fractals
Awesome Oscillator: Insert -> Indicators -> Bill Williams –> Awesome Oscillator
Acceleration Oscillator: Insert -> Indicators -> Bill Williams –> Acceleration Oscillator

Entry:

When (Alligator) lines are opening we put a buy stop one point above the most recent fractal outside of the lines in trend direction

Exit:

When (Alligator) lines are closing we are closing too.

we stay out of the market when and while lines are intertwining.

Adding:

After the first fractal is taken, we take any and every signal in that direction.

Adding Entry Signals:
AO: we go long when AO cross zero line from negative to positive values and short on the opposite scenario. we go long we have 3 consecutive AO bars above zero line last two having higher highs (i.e. AO pulls back for a while) - opposite for sell

AC:Go long after two consecutive bars above zero line Go long after three consecutive bars below zero line - for short - reverse scenario

________________________________________________________________

That's it. If you need more info - you could read more here

I'll try to answer any questions as best as I can...

Hi again

For pictures describe faster than words I'll attache some of the charts I'm using...

Attached is USDCHF Daily setup on Apr 15 2007

Hi isto,

This is very interesting.Thanks for posting this it has my full attention of learning more about the chaos theory. What  timeframes do you use ? Thanks in advance....

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Isto...thread looking very good. What currency pairs have you used this on?

Good Luck

Hello WHTenn,

Thank you for your interest...

I'm using majors but the method is described as univeral, i.e. any pair any market

Wish you positive trading

Here is a good incoming setup for EURUSD H4 from today

Let's see what it will become. Which me good luck  .

--- 帖子 #8 ---
There is another tool that could be useful

Gator: in MT use menu Insert -> Indicators -> Bill Williams –> Gator

It measues the distance between MA (Alligator) lines. It is useful because it shows you at a glance whether MAs are opening, closing or intertwining.

Trade after it becomes green.

Here is a sample&

when Gator is green - it is time to look around, but while there is not a fractal taken in this direction we do not enter the market

when Gator is red - it is time to take profit and/or wait for the next chance

Hope it will be useful to your trading

!i!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
That's too many indicator for me to handle but it seems good at first glance

--- 帖子 #10 ---
It seems so and also at first reading seems complicated but it is not. The longer you are with it the better it seems to be.

Well that;s my point of view of caurse...

Good luck

Here is a sample of an unfortunate trade

I've made a mistake with stop loss place. After the 6th consecutive red AO bar I should place the stopLoss above the last-1 bar's high and move it accordingly.

I have heard that there are many different reasons to take signals.  Are you takin just the fractals or the other ones as well.  Can you provide rules?

THanks...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi james275,

I've tried to describe signals in my 1st post here.

Here under I'll try to summarize them in brief...:

There are 5 tools issuing signals:

One enter the market when 1st fractal (#1) out of the lines is hit again.

Once on the market one opens a new order is same direction when any of the other signals is triggered.

These are: AO(#2), AC(#3), Zone(#4) and Balance Line(#5).

Some of them issue more than one signal.

If more than one signal is triggered simultaneously - corresponding number of orders are opened.

I personaly am taking each of the signal until my money management rules allow this.

I've tried to comment the charts attached in previous posts, pointing where signals are and where stops are.

If you have any questions please let me know - I'll do my best to answer them.

!i!

BTW - this method is described in "New Trading Dimensions" book by Bill Williams.

There is slight alterations of the system in his next book "Trading Chaos" 2nd edition

I have two pair with open orders for this week.

Here is the state of USDJPY H1 at the end of work-days. (You could see begining of the trade in post #16 and post #17)

The picture does not seems quite promising.

If the last compleated bar closes below Red Line (alligator teeth) - trade must be closed and I'll be kicked out.

Worst is that this will case losses...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Here is current stage of the other trade before the week-end - EURUSD H4

(you could follow this trade in post #7, post #11 and post #12)

Situation is the same as above (USDJPY) ...

Must exit if last compleated bar closes below red line - somewhere about 1.3682.

The good news is that there is no loss

Expected profit is about 29 000

The bad news is that this is a Demo account

We'll see...

wish you fascinating week-end

$i!

The EURUSD trade was a good one. I was kicked at 1.3586

I wont quote each trade here because it became too long, will only summarize.

It was an experiment (this is a demo account for, isn't it).

I placed 1 lot order for each and every signal came from the chaos rules.

They were total 38 signals. 38 1-lot-orders were placed

7 ended with a loss, all others (31) are profitable.

Max loss is -460

Max win is 2340

P/L result is 31 060

S/L was moved 3 times and last one was fired.

Looking for the next chance

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I looked into this briefly. I believe it was intended for daily timeframes originally and meant to take in trending sections (Alligator opens it's mouth etc).

Imho back when I checked it simply lagged price lightyears due to relying on so god awful many moving averages/oscillators and caught the last 5-15% of most moves if at all.

Did not convince me at all. Even most 4h EMA crosses would most likely do better on average(especially with pullback entries).

If you can make it work for you, all the better, but imho it's just making a basic concept (if the market moves strongly, follow it) a lot more complicated than it needs to be. Even a Breakout system is a lot more effective.

Ask our good friend MrTrend or have a look at StevieT....super simple approach, still gets net pips.

Just my opinion.

Take care,

SeekingLight

Thank you for your post SeekingLight.

Hello

I've re-read the last book about Chaos by BW and decided to add the rule about "Reverse bar".

It is quite simple one and if succed could final with a good profit, if not, the loss will be reduced (I hope)

So here are the rules:

Bearish Reversla Bar - sell orders

1. Bar with higher high that closes in the botom half - that should mean that bulls have been stronger at the beginning but next bears have superiority at bar closing.

2. Prices must be far away from the lines and must have obvious angle increase (opening) between MA lines and line drawn on the lows.

Entry:

Sell stop close below the low of the reverse bar

Stop loss little above the high of the same bar

That's it. Reverse for buy (use highs not lows!)

Why this is added? - If succeed it will allow an earlier entry.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
OK after the theory - let's try it

Here is EURUSD H1 setup AO is read (down move); bar is away below ma lines. Slopes of ma and price are in an opening angle - price much steeper. Good candidate for retrace end...

So

a Buy stop order -1 lot - placed above the Divergent (reverse) Bar at 1.3575

a stop loss place on the other side of the bar at 1.3536

whish me good luck

--- 帖子 #28 ---
HI

This is how yesterday setup (post #28) goes currently... We have another divergent (reverse) bar; acceleration has changed direction from down to up; Momentum also changed direction from down to up; AC 3 green bars signal has been triggered;

So 1 lot buy stop order placed above the rev.bar at 1.3576

another 1 lot buy stop order placed above AC signal bar 1.3588

stopLoss moved below the new DB at 1.3542

let's see  what will be the future...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Yesterday setup is developing pretty well...

BL and 2nd DBar has been taken. I expect a fractal to apear soon and AO cross signal to fire...

Mean line 2 previous set BL orders has been fired...

Dramatic... This seems to be wave 5 candidate...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Setup from before yesterday (post #28) seems to turn to profit...

Here is current state - early morning The most recent up fractal has been taken in the night so 1 lot buy stop order has been fired. New fractal and AO cross signal apeared simultaniously in the night - new 4 lot buy stop order is placed at 1.3647 - above signals

I'm wondering  about stop loss - whether I should move it up or leave it where it is...

The distance from the market is widening...

Above all we are in the zone so on each close that is above previous one I'll add more orders - but this is the future yet...

At present I have 12 open orders (last 2 lots) total: 13 lots showing a profit of 3 257.80 at current price 1.3637

let see what will be today

Good luck to all traders!

PS: I'll appreciate if anybody takes the plunge and comments the situation.

I'll appreciate any opitions and will consider them. The more the heads, the better the result

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Some explanations about reverse bar (DBar)...

We have on previous H4 session a bearish reverse bar but we do not take it because the angle is not correct. Prices must go steeper than MSs. There was steep movement but it was before bearish DB formation. When this bar appeared prices were in parallel with MAs...

Well at the begining of US market session EURUSD trade is in a good state

No more orders have been placed because we have already 5 green AO bars and this up move will soon end...

So the only action is to move stop loss below the low of the last bar...

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I love this type of trading! Just rated the thread - ***** stars for you!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi isto,

I really appreciate your thread. I just started trading this method after reading Bill's 2nd edition of Trading Chaos. It really helps to see how other traders trade this method. Have you read New Trading Dimensions by Bill also ? I have just ordered it and plan on doing some more reading over the weekend. I wish you well and look forward to following your thread. Keep up the great work !!!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thank you both Miguel and amaruenterprise

I already thought that nobody ever will post something ...  Thank you for the positive attitude - it is something that always help.

First the questions - I've read all three books by Bill Williams, each one several times  and I admire them for consistency and all these clear tight explanations of the signals, mothos of trade, etc.

I want to underline that I'm not a guru, neither have the key for wealth nor pretend to know where will be the price tomorrow or what will happen with any pair in the near or far future.

I've started this tread for three reasons:to master myselft and to learn by my mistakes to help my best anyone interested in trading this method to discute this particular method with others using it so as to improve my own knowledge and skills.

Trading is very fastinating way of life and I like it...

Wish you many profitable pips

--- 帖子 #35 ---
on the next day...

today's 1st chart is very doodle

At the end of US session yesterday I was 99% sure that I'll be blown away. I hesitated whether to close at least partially. This is the most painful part of the trade - when there are many signals and each one is in the opposite direction

Finally I left anything to the market for even if stop loss was hit, trade will be profitable - much less, but profitable.

In any case I placed a sell stop order below to the down Dbar in any case.

In contrary of last US session close at the begining of EU session there are many up signals....

So I'll keep stops tight and let's see what the maket wants...

(each trade day is described from post# 27 through post #31)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
So here is the end of the story...

Stoploss has been triggered at 1.3633.

the result is:

13 open positions

one of them 2 lots and one 4 lots

9 profitable

4 loss
2 830 profit from this trade

because I didn't close when rules say I have to, almost 50% of the profit has gone

Let's see whether this is the top of the wave and how will be with down Dbar signal

as seen in the picture the angle between price and MAs could be analysed also another way (gray is old; white is new)

There is another Up fractal. I didn't place order above it because for now it seems that momentum is rather down than up and could turn a false entry point. On D1 base the momentum is 4 days down and on W1 acceleration is down, so it seems to me that a very strong impuls must appear to push prices up.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I have been a Profitunity trader of one degree or another since 1999.  I moved my trading focus from futures to the spot Forex in 2004.  It is still my trading vehicle of choice for catching a strong trend and capturing profits far greater than the move itself... it has given me over 300% of a move on several occassions.  As time permits me, I will be glad to share some of my experiences with using all or part of the Profitunity trading approach; but for now, these words of caution: Have very sound risk management rules (the Profitunity way doesn't give you much guidance here!); and if you are one that tends to play loose with risk management rules, Profitunity will probably frustrate you!

Thank you for your post Larry,

you'll are very welcome. The more experience shared, the more chance to improve skills.

I agree - and this is one of the most importent thing in trade but hard to apply   - a sample is my previous post where a big part of the profit gone...

Expected though, price diving during last two H4 session surprised me.

Fortunately there were sell stop orders - 1 lot for each divergent bar. Currently both triggered.

At the begining of current H4 session another 2 lots sell stop order has been taken ...

Stop loss is set above previous bar high.

Interesting movment.

I've added the new exit line (described in post #39) to see how usefull it will be...

That's it.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Well nothing is forever...

This morning seems that market is wondering which way to take.

No momentum, acceleration is broken.

But this created two valid new sell signals a fractal and AO and one Dbar (false by the rules - because in almost in the lines)

I placed a 2 lot sell order for AO and a 4 lots sell order for F and moved stop above last 5th bar.

Let's see what will has in mind the market today.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
No more wondering.

Trade started yesterday (post#40 and post#41) is closed.

I want to mention two points

The strong support aroung 1.3585 make me to get out from last two orders. This gave me a smal profit of 1 pip ($60 for all 6 lots)

Dbar makes me to keep Stop loss tight which helped me to exit from the trade with profit.

Small, but profit...

Here is trade data:

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thanks for your offer of help Larry.  I believe that the strategy of adding to a trend makes lots of sense.  My question is indeed about your risk management strategy.  What size do you make your lots? Do you very the size at all or keep the size equal and take each signal?

THanks for your help.

Jim No

Hello Jim

Until Larry answer the questions, here is Bill Williams point of view as it is layed in his books (in brief trnasformed by myself):

In past years trends have been strong and relatively long this is why he suggests to add a contract on each signal. Nowadays trends are less long and are rare and this is why we have to profit from short moves increasing contracts on each signal. He also suggest adding in following proportion:

1:5:4:3:2 - i.e. 1st signal 1 contract; 2nd - 5 contracts; 3rd - 4 contracts and so on...

I personally do not use the above system, but dicide on each signal depending on overall situation of the market....

Regards...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thank you.  I really think that adding on is a good profitable strategy.  I like that you don't risk so much during the sideways market and then bump the # as the trade continues.

I enjoy your thread!!

Good Trading,

Early Monday we have a GBPCHF Bullish DBar. This setup is a little bit confusing because there are lots of up and down signals ...

We have two up fractals which are forming a Double Top and in the same time three down fractals forming Head and Shoulders in the bottom.

Momentum is weak. Acceleration is down. On the other hand we have a gap down filled immediately during next few sessions

Anyway I decided to buy a lot and give a try to the devergent signal. I was lucky enough for the price rallied up.

So currently I've moved stop loss a little bit above breakeven and have 1 lot on the long side.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Just a short message...

stoploss (from previous post) was hit during the previous session and I'm out with 9 poits profit.

That's it for now...

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Drifting around I found this strong setup formed by USDCAD: steep diving greate angle between MA and price close at the upper half

Additionally we have acceleration slow down in D1 and long decline unsuccessful bottom break at W1 Momentum and AO strong divergence in MN and H4

So I'm going to give a try and put a buy stop above Dbar at 1.1107 with a stoploos on the oposite side of this bar at 1.1044

Let's see what will say the market...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi isto, what time frame is the chart you have pictured ? On all of my usd/cad time frames I'm not seeing it. Thanks.....

--- 帖子 #50 ---
H4 (four hours).

Sorry   I've missed this because this is the most suitable for me timeframe. There might be some difference in prices but in general should be the same

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thanks for the reply isto. The H4 timeframe is pretty much what I trade off of but I do like to look at the other timefames as well. Thanks once again and I really appreciate your thread and look forward to reading your analysis on your trades as well......

Isto, how do you get the extra signals shown on the chart?  Is that some special indicator you have?

I too appreciate this thread.

Hello Jim

Yes I have - it is a Chaos indicator made by miself because I prefer to be alarmed when a signal appears. It is in a test period ...

Hello

Surprisingly to me :surprised  this night EURJPY has rally up. There was a fractal formed on Apr. 27 which doesn't seemed promising to me... ( this just confirms how hard is to predict price movement, if ever possible ) ... I had mark it (there was no buy stops set) and this is why I was in a little bit later

After this fractal has been taken few other signals had been triggered. Here we have:AO Buy and New Fractal signals on Apr 27 Another three AO and two BL signals and one false DBar on Apr 30 one AC signal on May 1 two bars Green Zone

All of this signals but the last one has been taken tonight so I'm long with 5 lots (summarized) with few pending orders

Let's see   what the market has in mind...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Here is how is going DBar on USDCAD on H4 (post #48)

Buy stop order has been taken and I'm 1 lot long.

Meanwhile there is another DBar formed during previous session (another 1 lot buy stop has been placed) and down fractal below previous DBar.

It is stil unclear whuch way the market intend to go...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Jim No:

I apologize for the tardy response... I've been off playing grandpa.

First, my position sizing and risk management rules tell me exactly my lot limit for a trade; and for me "a trade" begins when I get on board a directional move and includes any subsequent add-on lots. A trade is opened only on a signal from one of the Three Wise Men. Here is how I normally allocate that lot limit:By my rule, I commit only 1 lot per buy/sell signal. Once a trade is opened, a signal is valid only if its fill will be beyond the Alligator in the direction of the trade. As long as my trade is profitable, I take all valid Profitunity trade signals until my lot limit is reached or the trade is closed. Valid Profitunity trade signals include those described in Bill Williams' second book, New Trading Dimensions. Before adding on to a profitable position, pay strict attention to how the add-on will impact trade risk limits and where breakeven is!

For now it is not clear where will go the market. Fractal buy orders are still pending... There is also a down fractal which I'm watching....

--- 帖子 #58 ---
At the beginning of the yesterday US session the fractal that seemed to bocome a setup has been suddenly triggered and I fall into the market on the long side. Movement continues and a new up fractal was formed and lately triggered.

Here on the chart is seen one of the Bill Williams' recommendations: do not add on BL signal after 5th green AO bar, but move stop loss blow the Low of the previous to the current bar.

So I'm long with 2 orders (1+5 lots).

--- 帖子 #59 ---
This is the order from yesterday (post #48)

We have 2 BDars and an up Fractal - all triggered at a strong momentum. Market is accelerating and the pictures shows a probable reverse of the movement from down to up (both down fractals have formed a double bottom).

This is the last trade I'm in for I do not like to trade simultaneously and I'm not going to entry new one

--- 帖子 #60 ---
ISTO:

Re post #58.  Didn't you mean "ZT" (zone trade) rather than "BL" (balance line) re Williams saying take no more signals after a 5th consecutive green AO bar?

Hi larry,

Do you just trade forex with Bill's profitunity or other markets too? How has it worked out for you in forex? Thanks in advance for your reply....

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Yes sure, sorry

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I have been trading the spot Forex almost exclusively since I discovered it in 2004; but prior to that, I traded the futures markets.  I was introduced to the Profitunity methodology and strategies in late 1998 or early 1999 as I recall.  As a futures trader, I used only EOD data and traded off daily charts; and I traded the Profitunity way pretty much as it was spelled out in Bill Williams' second book, New Trading Dimensions.  The only time I use its "pile it on" approach in my Forex trading is when I have been lucky enough to catch a new daily chart trend that reversed after getting hit by the "5 magic bullets" that ended the previous trend.  I am mostly an intraday trader now, but there still is a lot of Profitunity in how I now trade.  Yes, Profitunity has been very good to me.  I personally think that to use all of its entry signals and exit strategies, one needs to be trading it in the daily time frame.

thank you dlftrader.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Here is something that may interest some of you re the 1st and 2nd Wise Men that were introduced in Trading Chaos, 2nd Edition.  They may be more useful as filters than entry signals.  One of my trading strategies for the M5 time frame is to nest a buy order above the VFH when the AO bar is green, and to nest a sell order below the VFL when the AO bar is red... whether or not the AO bar is positive or negative.  Could more pips be captured if I required any entry signals generated by the 1st or 2nd Wise Men to have been hit before nesting a 3rd Wise Man order?  In other words, would a signal failure by the 1st or 2nd Wise Men keep me out of more loss or low profit trades?  I started looking at this because I am reluctant to enter a trade on the wrong side of the Alligator... most of us old-time Profitunity disciples likely are having trouble with that!

Hello Larry,

Thank you for sharing the above with us.

I'd like to add that the Chaos Trading System is designed basically for tranding markets rather than sideway moves and adding is very useful when a trand is on.

In the book, you've mentioned, is noted than trands are more and more rare. This is why a new approach is required.

It is Divergent Bar - an attempt to enter market on the least sign of trend reversal. As one could guess - this increase potential profit, if trend reverse. Increasing potential profit corresponds with increased risk. This brings into the world new, so called, pink [purple] line.

Pink line is 5 SMA shifted 3 bars to the right. It is serving as a stop loss - trade have to be closed when there are two bars closing on the opposite of the movement side.

Finally: nevertheless which side one enters the market there is an ever lasting dilemma:If we enter the market using DBar - the signal might turn to a false one If we don't - we might miss a substantial move and market to turn around just after taking the fractal. Last two trades (post #66 & post #67) are good samples of the above.

Perhaps this is why a substantial part of the book is devoted to trader's mind...

Thanks Grandpa....from one to another. The hard part is being married to a "grandma!".

I am a trend trader and looked real hard at Bill's stuff before and now am relooking at the whole system.  I think the magic of this system is the ability to add on reoutinely during a trending market and having a relativiely small position during the times of consolidation.  In my trading i am able to get in, but want to be able to add on in a systematic way.  Thanks for your input Larry.

Would love to compare notes sometime.

My best,

Jim No

It seems to me that current state of GBPUSD H4 chart is a good DBar candidate.

It failed to take previous low 1.9865 (Apr 27) formin a double bottom.

Angle is steep and opening. We have two divergent bars formed with AO red bars.

Down acceleraion is slowing and momentum is up during current H4 session.

If I have chance this could be a trend reversal.

Let's see

After yesterday drop down, EURJPY turned up once again taking previous two fractals. Will price go higher?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Isto,  In regards to your long us chf, post #58, i am curious as to why you didnt set up a stop and reverse with the wise man #1?  Maybe you didnt get that signal because of different data or you didnt like the angle?  These bw1 signals work real well with elliot waves and harmonic patterns.  Great thread, keep it up.

Interesting is USDCAD H4 chart.

There is almost no buy signals until May 2 (these are 29 session bars!)

It seems that pair was afraid from yesterday attempt to break 1.1030 lever and it stumbled over 1.10 level.

Instead there are lots of down fractals showing movement direction and resistance to continue down.

I'll keep watch it ...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
yeah, unexpected from UsdCad..  i think the price will go test daily chart resistance which is 1..1142. on 4H MACD, it seems has break the 4H resistance on 1.1048. so i'll wait for pullback and the go Long ... i am right ?

Hello MizZu

Nobody knows what will be the future.

There are basicly three opportunities: Goes up; goes down; goes sideway.

For each of these there might be found pro and cons.

I personally do not borther where will be the market - I'm trying just to be ready nevertheless where it goes.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hello

Today GBPJPY formed a nice Bulish Divergent bar pattern on H4. We could see a nice angle, momentum was still down on the bar, but acceleration was slowing decline and turned into up direction.

Additionally price failed to break down the channel...

Buy Stop Oerder was placed on 238.45 (dashed horizontal blue line) and later has been triggered so I'm 1 lot on the long side waiting for 3 green AO to start adding. Because of the fast move in short time I've tighten stoploss a little bit.

Let's see what is comming next

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Steep movement from yesterday top to 239.80 and

formed two bearish divergent bars so trade was closed

at 239.50 resulting in 46.5 point profit.

New 1 lot Sell Stop Order placed on 239.34 below the DBar.

New 1 lot Buy Stop Order placed on 239.81 above up fractal.

Looking for the next move

--- 帖子 #86 ---
USDCAD post #81 continue hesitating where to go.

Finally an up fractal has been formed. Momentrum and acceleration though are weak and it test may fail

Be prepare for both directions.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
well, when the price pull back to the daily resistance, i go Long @ 1.1065. Tp = 1.1085 . and now my trade has closed. another 20 pips today

happy trading

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Obviously GBPJPY (poist #85) will rest for some time drifting along. As price does not goes down I decided to go out at 239.29...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
After few days drifting today turns to be quite fasinating day

Because I obviously cannot publish and describe anything on time –

here is a quick link for a good Divergent Bar sample from today.

It totally resulted in slightly more than $6500 profit.

Hope to be useful for you.

Bravo!

GBPAUD on the H4 chart shows nice exaple for the chaos trading system.

These few days it dived deep down after Divergent Bars formed on May 4th.
Bullish Up fractal from May 9th was not taken at all and yesterday we had a Bulish Divergent Bar.

Analysis from yesterday you could find here.

On the same time on Daily chart (you may see it here) a double bottom was formed yesterday confirming validity of the DBar.

Fibonacci Expansion 100% (orange dashed lined in the bottom right corner) was also touched and had confirmed this support level.

Adding retracement from the bearish two Dbars (1st) and from up fractal (2nd) formed probabal target level for an up counter trend move (colored in light blue).

I used conservative target 2.4009 for I supposed to be taken during the night. I was lucky enough to be right  resulting in 145 pips profit

Of course we have to keep in mind that the main point of interest is whether 2.38 level will be broken.

If it is there is a nice horizon in front. If not a nice up trend might start.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
USDCAD postponed 1.10 level attack (or is mustering up to do it).

Meanwhile after double bottom was formed a new up fractal was formed

and later was successfully taken giving a signal for a long trade.

Too soon perhaps it accelerated and momvment went up supporting the new direction.

Today a new up fractal was formed and taken, supported with AO Zero cross and AC acceleration signal.

Let's see how strong the moving forces will be in the up direction

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hello Isto. How are you?

I have a question: How do you choose the divergence bar. For example in the last chart of the usd,cad i see a couple of them, but you entered on the break of the fractal.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello Miguel

There are two things I look for:Stable move in one direction Greater angle between price and red line (Alligator's teeth)

As you could see on the chart - neither of the mentioned exists - move has been killed by double bottom; there is almost lack of angle

The probabbility movement to reverse to down direction after double bottom is relatively small. Support to this is idea give weekly and monthly charts where double bottom also apear. Prices need some force and time to mustering it.

Acctually if you have taken the 1st DBar you could collect some profit...

I personally prefer to trade only when I have clear picture about the situation and stay out if I have any hesitations.

Even now up move could break (i.e. on the news) and reverse...

No one knows ... but everyone must be prepared and to have clear plan what to do in either case...

You also could reffer to post #26 for more info about DBar.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks for the detailed answer. I have to read more about that ANGLE, not sure i follow that.

Have a good trading and weekend

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Before to enjoy the week-end we have to note a new Bullish Divergent Bar setup formed on 4 hours chart of GBPUSD.

We could see:a steeper price diving than the red line (Alligator's teeth) has. a down momentum (red AO bars) slowing acceleration (green AC bars) unsuccessful taking over of the channel's bottom

This setup is supported also by the 38.2% consolidation in the Daily chart.

(you could see it here)

Wish you a nice relacing weekend

Previous Bullish Divergent Bar (post #91) faded fast (but was profitable) just to test 2.3780 level once more time.

For now it seems the test failed forming double bottoms.

To support these bottoms there are another Bullish Divergent Bar - hope it would be more profitable :

May be we could hope for a rally to 78.6 to 161.8 levels?

These are supported again by Double Bottoms on Daily chart (which are not completed yet).

Not completed though, this setup seems to become more profitable than prevous one

moving either up or breaking down.

Here is the next step in GBPAUD pair (previous comments are in post #98 and #91)

Here is a nice setup formed on EURAUD H4 chart.

There are two bulish divergent bars with an acute angle chumming with two bearish down fractals.

There is almost no aceleration in either direction - i.e. narrow range.

We have two opportunities:

either bulls to get predominance or bears will - clear, eh?

One must be prepared for either directional move.

Here is a nice trade on EURGBP rally.

We have two DBars failed (loss). Stop loss for each is marked with red lines on the chart.

Yesterday the news fired Buy Stop Oprder of a Bullish Divergent Bar opening the angle between price and red line (Alligator's teeth).

This surprisingly kicked me in the long side.

After the strong impulse movement has fallened and the next entry on the 3rd green AO bar failed. Few sessions later a new Bearish Divergent Bar was formed and I took it as a signal to go out locking the profit. Small profit is better that small loss, right?

It seems that Support and Resistance are too close and forces for the moment are strong enough...

EURAUD trade (setup is in post #100) is ended.

At the begining stop loss has survived after the shart decline but Bearish fractal has not been taken so the patiance was compensated and an up move was fact.

3rd green AO bar has been taken and later the Bullish fractal was broken up.

Then there were another 2 orders - one on AO Zero cross and the other on 2 green AC bars.

Finally Exit was on 38.2 Fibo level cross down.

Isto i love your way of trading (chaos trading) but i still find it hard to understand your first signal. the way you chose the DB because i see so many on the charts...

I will read Bill book again now, co's i am so confused about the first signal

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hello Miguel

I'm glad you like this system.

Francly speaking I also had dificulties (this is for every begining, eh?) when I started. Even now I make lots of mistakes

Clear though the system require very titgh rule following because the trader easely could decide that current movement is accidental and soon will tun in "our direction".

As you could see from the previous post I am also often surprised by the market direction. There is no tool capable to predict market direction, especially forex. Probabilities - yes, but prediction... Last trade (post #104) was a (pleasent for me) surprise and the only reason I was in and made profit was following the rules.

DBar rules are simple. DBar has preceeding:steep move acute angle buy/sell stop order above/below the DBar

Next is patiance (easy to say ; hard to follow  ) and always keep an eye on the stops.

Another sample I would point is this post #105 where it could seems the exit earlier but by my rules.

But this depends on one style of trading.

I personally prefer to lock profit when I've any doubt - actual profit is better than actual loss based on a hypothetical begger profit  .

If you have questions I'll try to answer them. Read the books though. They are good and comprihensive.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Thanks for your time once again. I enjoy your blog also, good information there for chaos trading.

For me the hard part of the system is the to choose the DB to enter, after that things get more easy.

See you later!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
This is the most risky part endeed. Follow the rules above and knowledge with come with the practice.

I've made a check list (in my head for I'm lazy enough) and I'm trying to follow it as strict as I can. And again I make mistakes and miss one or another thing... But we are human beens...

Hallo Invincible

These, you see on the charts, are just the same signals I've described but because I do lots of things concurrently I need some alerts to draw my attention to the chart.

I do not beleve to "black box" things telling me when and how much to enter or exit the market. This leeds to loss only. If you do  not understand what are you doing even the best indicator or expert won't help you make profit.

So I sit on my ... chair and scribbled an indicator

I also used to hunt tools previously to beat the market with, but the market proved  (painfully for  ) me that the best tool is my mind - no one else could help me.

I'll quote by hart B.Williams - "We trade our believes"

This is why I did not offer this indicator up to know.

Another reason is that all this is still under development. There are some thing to be mastered. When ready (hope soon) and if results are satisfying I'll consider some sort of distribution if there is any interest of it.

For the moment I'm not ready to do this because (you could see around) there are lot's of complains, improvement suggestions and so on which I cannot neither answer nor deal with.

Finally - writing of an indicator is not hard - creating the system is....

EURUSD is hesitating where to go. This morning it seems that up pros are little bit more that cons as seen in the chart. Double bottoms fromed both in H4 and D1 charts are supporting up move.

If Dbar is taken - be ready to add aggressively (because of the 2 AC green bars above zero and 3 AO green bars below zero), but in the same time be redy for direction turn...

If Dbar is missed - look for the Bullish Fractal as a next possible entry...

A new Bearish Divergent Bar setup was formed early today.

It seems to be strogly supported in daily and weekly chart

This could be another Bearish attemt to chanege movement direction -> read more here.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Here we could see very strong resistance from the Bears. Number of Bullish attempts to break 1.6440 level failed so far...

Be prepared for either up or down move, nevertheless down is looking more probable at the moment.

Most of traders never know what will happen next (unless it is a medium  ).

This is why we need rules to follow. They help us to stay on track...

Generaly.

Sometimes though these rules kick us out hard and we need other rules  to make our flight less painful.

Here is a sample showing how a nice setup could transform itself to a nice loss.

I think chart is clear enough but for those that need words:Green is entry point - below teh DBar low reds are the trailing stoploss and the exit

There are a bearish and a bullish fractals, last taken after the sharp rally last session.

At the end would like to point to the closing Alligator mouth after Bearish DBar formation.

At the end of US Session USDCHF see post #136 continue forming patterns.

On the H4 chart below is visible the triangle break down after both Bearish Divergent Bars. After the srong and fast decline are formed support ar 61.8% Fibo from previous up move and ressistance at 38.2% Fibo from the last down move.

Previous support at 1.2250 becomes resistance - classic

Will see what will bring tommorow sessions

Surprise again

GBPCHF broke down taking few Bearish Fractals is a fury down move.

Now looking back I see that this down move has been signaled by Bearish Head and Shoulder formation and two Bulish fractals sitting alone there...

I've just missed all these

Fortunately I had put sell stop orders on the Bearish Fractals

After the start of the trade we could see, as in the USDCHF (post #136 and #138), classical move - retracement to 68.1 and back testing 38.2 levels.

It seems there is a potential to dive to 2.41 level

It seems that I've missed to discuss this trade, so it is time to correct this.

The story begins here and develops through few series - here (part 2) and here (part 3)

Confimed by Double Tops though I didn't bet much on this Bearish Divergent Bar and trade.

As often happens market surprised me once more, proving me that predition is just lost of time (and money sometimes)

The chart is quite clear - greens are entry points, red are stops. Trade is stil open on the short side.

Hello amaruenterprise

I've made some experts helping me to keep eye on the signals generated. They double the signals from the original indicators and oscilators. At the moment are not finalized and sometimes are wrong. I use them just to draw my attention back on chart...

Hi,

I'm sorry to worry you guys with this question and it may be a silly question at this late stage of the game BUT I have been looking at this system and read it and reread it and reread it and I have read my charts manual AND I JUST DON'T GET THE FRACTALS!

I mean - I know what a buy fractal IS i.e. it's description and I know what a sell fractal IS also by it's description BUT what do they look like on the chart?

Just take a look at my charts help on fractals and you'll see what I mean!

In the picture I don't understand what makes the buy fractal different to the sell fractal - they look the same to me AND if that's not enough - the lines from the Chaos Theory say:

'if a buy fractal is above the alligators teeth ... buy stop one tick above the high of the up fractal'

and

'if a sell fractal is below the alligators teeth ... sell stop one tick below the low of the fractal sell signal'

Referring to my attached chart I could understand if a buy fractal was pointing down and was below the alligators teeth and I could understand if a sell fractal was pointing up and was above the alligators teeth BUT on my chart they are BOTH pointing up.  I have also looked at the diagrams in the Chaos Theory and I can't make sense of the example(s) (and I don't think I'm a stupid person so this is driving me nuts)!!!

Is a fractal not just another name for 'Pivot Point'?  If it is then surely a fractal pointing down means that you have hit bottom and it is a signal to buy and a fractal pointing up means that you have hit top and it is a signal to sell?

I suppose in short - what does a VALID buy fractal look like and what does a VALID sell fractal look like?

Does it matter which way they are pointing i.e. up or down?  The reason I ask is that if I follow the rules then I would be lucky to have a valid trade in weeks so I know that I'm not understanding this correctly and unfortuanately the fractals is the first indicator to watch for before moving on to the others.

I have also noticed that if you wait for all of these other indicators (Chaos Theory) to be in agreement with one another (besides the fractals because I don't get them) you are entering a trade VERY late in the direction of the trend.  Is this a fair comment?

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hello Dale

I'll try to explain in few posts so as sharts to be visible

1. Up (Bulish) Fracktal is always up and Down (bearish) - always down

2. we count bars always from right to left

3. on up fractal we have up move and correction of at leat 2 bars - during this two bars we put our buy stop above fractal bar

I hope the picture below will clear the points

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Here's my point of view about trading your chart. Hope it is clear.

If you have question - ask.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi - and thanks for the (very quick) reply.

I am MORE confused though (sorry - I don't know why this is so difficult for me to understand)!

In your first message you say:

but on the chart on that same message you seem to be saying the opposite.  Is this a mistake?

Also - from what you are telling me would you say that my chart manual is also wrong i.e. my example that comes from the chart manual?

Sorry - I'm battling with this!

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I know I'm probably typing over you with this but I had a look at your take on the graph that I posetd (thanks for going to the trouble with all of the markup).

I'm also confused about the timing.  The way I have read it and the way I have been observing these fractals they are only drawn if there is two bars on either side of them SO if I take another look at your marked up chart then by placing a short stop where you have marked it in green that stop would never get hit because that fractal was only drawn after two bars have closed to the right of it and look where that candle opened.

Like I said - I'm probably not getting this.

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
2nd - 1st: Read the books (if possible) - not manuals. I do not know the manual. what is drawn on the chart is correct.

then 1st: no mistake. It seems to me that you turn the signals upside down somehow.

Here is an attempt to explain fractal.

Bars 1 through 5 are creating fractal on bar 3 which has higher high than the preceeding two bars (1 & 2), right?

Bars 4 and 5 have lower highs that bar 3 and this is the condition - at least 5 bars where we have a bar with a higher high than the others and we have two lower highs on both side of fractal bar - this is for bullish fractal.

So on the drawing below you have a bulish fractal on bar 3, right?

let say the high price is 1.2345 so you entry point is 1 tick above, i.e. you put buy stop order on 1.2346.

Actual long side entry is on bar 8 because bars between 3 and 8 have lower high than fractal bar (#3) and bar 8 has reach a price higher than our fractal (1.2345).

Hope I've written all this clear enough

If you need - ask

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Sorry may be I did confuse you with the color I'll try another way

Chart become very colorful  but I hope will be more clear

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Nah - you've still got me!

OK - to put it into perspective I have attached another (live) chart.

Based on the fractals being displayed what would you be doing?

This may help me understand (the other chart like I said was just from the online help manual).

The horizontal green line by the way is the pivot point calculated from using yesterdays data where I just opened a short when it was hit based on the pivot point / line - and I don't see any new fractals appearing at this time (although it is a 15 minute chart that I am posting just for the purposes of explanation).

Are these fractals not supposed to be telling me when and where to be adding to the positions i.e. where and when would they appear?

Put it this way - if the price goes down - what will the fractals look like and what will they be telling me (assuming it goes down and down).

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
OK - now a new fractal has appeared - pointing up.

What is this telling me to do?

I know these things are supposed to be used in conjunction with AO and AC BUT for now I need to understand the most basic element WHICH IS THE FRACTALS for crying out loud!!!

Thanks for your input and help though - much appreciated!

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
OK - I think I've got it (finally):

If I understand this correctly:

When an up fractal appears you would place a buy stop one tick above the value of the high of the candlestick or bar to which the fractal is attached AND when a down fractal appears you would place a sell stop one tick below the value of the low of the candlestick or bar to which the fractal is attached? Correct?

If the above is correct then this system assumes the following (in sort of laymans terms):

The price will reach a high (or maximum), it will then retract for a couple of candlesticks or bars, and then (eventually) shoot through the high of the candlestick or bar that that has the up fractal attached to it and in so doing execute your buy stop (and obviously the reverse applies when the price reaches a low (or minimum)?

Is this not just pivot point trading?

And to take it one step further when a new fractal appears the preceding one is no longer valid and the associated order is cancelled and a new order is placed according to the direction of the new fractal?

OK - I am getting ahead of myself here now - and assuming that the above is correct - and - if it is - it would appear that any single one order that was placed was ever hit (based on the live chart attached - DAX 30 Daily) - correct?

I know that I am not taking into account the readings of Alligator, Gator, AO, and AC in my example and maybe that is why this looks like a system where you would be very lucky to make one trade only now and then let alone make a profit?

I understand that as well as serving as entry points the fractals are telling you whether or not it is a bullish or bearish trend but based on what I think I understand of this by the time your order is executed (if ever) in a bullish trend the bulls have all but run out of steam and the opposite in a bear market?

On the other hand - I am a great believer in anything Bill Williams or J. Welles Wilder - and I find it impossible to believe that my observations are correct.

Please help.

Regards.

Dale.

Would you believe - I think 'the penny just dropped' :surprised !

It's amazing what a bit of sleep can do!

To quote:

'Fractals are valid until they are either triggered or a new fractal in the same direction appears ...'

In other words - a new fractal IN THE SAME DIRECTION invalidates the previous fractal and associated order IN THE SAME DIRECTION!

That could work!

The only problem I forsee here is if you brokerr is one of those that hunts stops (which mine regularly does). If you have that problem I would err on the side of caution and place your orders above the fractal itself NOT above the high of the candlestick or bar where the fractal is attached. That way your orders would only be executed when a genuine move occurs and not when 'spiked'. You would be getting into a trade a bit later BUT at least you would have ammunition with which to approach your broker to exact a refund!

Have I got it? Do I, do I?

Edit:

Upon reading further would it be safe to assume that once an order that has been placed, based on a fractal signal, has been triggered, then subsequent fractals in the same direction may be used to add to the position as well as signals from AO and AC as they occur?  In other words - you do not need to wait for a fractal signal AND confirmation from AO AND confirmation from AC to enter a trade?  If you had to wait for all three indicators to be giving a signal it appear that you would wait a long time between trades?

Regards,

Dale.

Hello Dale

Sorry for this delay but I've problem with my PCs

This is the answer of post #167.

My experience shows me that the lower time frame is the most dificult to manage trades - but this is only my oppinion.

to your chart - general rule is: we take only sell signals that atr below the alligator and buy signals only above alligator.

Because we are below the lines we look only for sell signals.

Black arrows mark sell fractals - below we place sell stop orders;

Green lines are actual entry point in the market - where sell stop orders (placed below the fractals) has been executed.

That's it

--- 帖子 #172 ---
This new fractal is too early to be a reverse. I'll look for a conformation or retrace before the up move to be confirmed.

Anyway time frames below H1 are not reliable enough and there are lots false signals...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
This does not make sense.

Fractals in same direction confirm the signal  rather than to invalidate it.

We use it to add orders in trend direction.We get first fractal outside of the Alligator and enter market on the trend direction. We add on each consecutive signal after the 1st fractal is taken - i.e. price has moved above/below fractal's high/low

how much above high or below low of the candle you'll put the order is a personal decision. You could use stop orders or you could do it manually.

If this is a trend beginning there is no problem to enter late, but this won't keep you dry  from 'spikes'...

Yes

Here are some brief explanation that might be useful reading for you.
system itself, The Alligator reading, Fractals and also the beginning of the thread

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Good morning,

Glad you're back!

As you can see I was doing a lot of reading and backtesting this weekend!

Sorry - I should have been more clear:

What I meant was that this applies ONLY when opening a position.  Only after the position is open / order has been triggered do you use the subsequent fractals in the same direction to add to the position BUT when opening the position only the last fractal in an up or down position is valid i.e. a new fractal in the same direction invalidates the previous fractal and order in the same direction (of course all of this taking the Alligator into account).

I'm a big fan of Parabolic SAR and (as you probably know) this indicator was specifically designed to agressively protect profits / negate losses so today I will experiment by placing my stop loss on orders at the CURRENT value of Parabolic SAR and keep adjusting the stop loss as new dots appear i.e. as if you were already in a trade.  This gives a very wide margin for error AND could result in huge losses I know (especially on the 4 hour and daily charts) BUT at least you won't get whipsawed out in a hurry.

Thanks for all of your input.

Once 'the penny dropped' it was amazing and I'm glad to see I don't know more than Bill Williams!

Regards,

Dale.

I do not take so strict the words.

The general idea behind chaos trading system is to trade with trend and to stay in as long as possible.

Signals are only to make things clear for the trader and to asure that trader will enter on the right side of the market.

Fractals, as a signal, are place where direction changes. So once formed thay say one only thing - 'here is an edge', i.e. direction has changed. Once created it is always valid. It is only a mark.

Trades are made by us and to quote the book "we trade our believes".

After some hesitation about validity of Bearish Divergent Bar it turned into a profitable short trade ( look the story here and here).

Today we have a new Bearish Divergent Bar setup supported by resistance around 78.6% Fibo level. The angle is reasonable and if we are lucky enough market might offer a new profitable short trade.

nice job.

do you trade with your own money or demo trading?

if you trade with 1 lot every time what the total capital that you use ? 10k , 20k, 50k?

keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I have a demo and a real account. Demo I'm using to test alterations in the system and is more friquently used

On the real I'm using less agressive methods.

There are profitable periods and losses of caurse. Both are on the positive site for last half an year...

In general it doesn't matter - the main purpose of this writting is to clear this system to interested traders and to miself too and to reduce false signals as much as possible and to "let profit runs".

Easy to say - hard to do

--- 帖子 #181 ---
hi isto... nice thread you have here. I'm still confused with buy/sell fractals... from my understanding the buy fractal is valid once it's above the gator teeth (middle line) right? but somehow i did read your comments to one of the member here, you're saying above alligator... do you mean above the jaws (or below the gator lips for sell fractal)?

thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Right - original version is buy fractal is valid when the price at the moment it is taken is above the red line. (Quote is by heart and is not exact...)

But...

If you browse your charts you certanly will note that there are as many false buy fractals above the red line as there are buy fractals giving the start of profitable trade.

My personal belief is that, especially when lines are intertweening or have been intertweened - let say - about 10 sessions back, there is high probability the first (even first several) fractal(s) to be false signal(s).

I analyse each situation separately and do not have a clue about...

In general false signals apear often and it is hard to weed them out.

I'll appreciate comments about this (false signals) if somebody has idea(s) and would be kind enough to share them with us...

--- 帖子 #183 ---
thanks isto... yup i agree with you regarding the false signal that might get triggered if you just take the gator teeth as your ref point for buy/sell fractals... i personally use gator lip and jaw to determine my buy/sell post...however i still hit by stop loss... another thing what's your method to determine your stop loss? do you refer to the pink line value as your stop loss at the point (above or below) fractals?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi sierra,

well stop positioning is another complicated stuff - it depensds on lot's of factors...

I use few diffenet stop loss placing rules. Generaly I put them away so as to avoid accident hits. I use them as a last firewall, i.e. I prefer to exit trades manually if they do not develop as expected.

One of the main point to detemine stoploss is the pair itself - it is useless to set same stop loss (i.e. 5, 50, 150 pips) on EURUSD and EURAUD for exapmle (this is only my point of view of caurse)

Another one is the picture from upper time trames - I use one type of stop loss at the beginning of the move, another after trend is clear enough and still another when Allicator starts closing its mouth...

In one word - I stop loss placement depends on the current market picture.

From here on there are two options:Bearish Divergent Bar - short entry - because of the second DBar attempt, acceptable angle and Acceleration slow Balance Line - long entry - because the bulls might be more powerful that expected...

New Bearish Divergent Bar is formed today.

The angle is closing and becomes less and less acute. There is still an option to make some retrace (probable retrace levels are marked in red)

Keep your eyes open for this might turn an outer bar and up move might sprike surprisingly. Daily chart is still intacked and we have there 3 green AO bars meaning that momentum is still up...

let's see

meanwhile yesterday long trade of the break of 2nd Bearish Divergent Bar closed with small profit.

Hello everyone (and isto),

isto - you asked if anyone had any input with regard to false signals.

Well - here is my trillion dollars worth:

I started using this system last Monday (after I had had a hard time trying to understand the fractal signals) and I can honestly say that apart from the first day (last Monday) that I started using this system I have made consistent net profit every single day since using this system.

Like I said before - I am a firm believer in anything Bill Williams and J. Welles Wilder but I could never get my head around the fractal thing until last week (thanks to incorrect information in my charts manual - and yes - isto - the charts manual that I have is indeed incorrect - but that's of no consequence now anyway)!

Anyway - as far as false fractal signals are concerned - I have had a look at the weekly and daily charts of the instruments that I normally trade i.e. DAX 30, Dow, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, MSCI Taiwan, Hang Seng Index, Nikkei 225, Gold, Silver, Crude Oil, and the SP500 (ASX) and I have found that yes there may be false signals EVEN when buying above the alligators lips or selling below the alligators jaw BUT the profitable trades BY FAR outweigh the losing trades AS LONG AS YOU USE STOPS - and that is the key here. In my opinion this is the 'Holy Grail' of trading systems (at least for me) BUT money management will make or break this system.

So far - I have followed the system 'to the letter' - but with the instruments that I trade - it appears that if I 'break the rules' just slightly i.e. buying or selling as soon as a buy or sell fractal appears close to the alligator's teeth (and not necessarily when the fractals appear on the right side of the teeth either) profits are maximized even with small losses.

As a matter of fact - on long term trades - I reckon you could get away without the alligator i.e. open an order for all and every single fractal that appears (obviously removing the previous order when a new fractal appears) although I know that this is diverging from the overall purpose and theme of this system i.e. to keep you in a trend and stay in for as long as possible.

I have attached a graph to demonstrate what I mean (it is the weekly chart for the DAX 30).

You'll note that I have taken the fractal signals regardless of whether or not they are on the right side of the teeth i.e. as long as they are close to the teeth no problem.

The DAX 30 is probably a bad example to demonstrate false signals because it trends most of the time but even in a ranging market this system works for the simple reason that unless there is a breakout from the range you are not actually in the market until the breakout happens so although you may have to wait some time for this happen when it does you're good to go.

I find my biggest problem with this system is when to take profit i.e. although I am doing fantastic with this system I tend to take profit far too early and Mr Williams does not seem to cover this too well although if the truth be told I am still developing trust in the system and I reckon once you have developed this trust and confidence and are prepared to see the trade through to its end based on the alligator then everything is good!

Regards,

Dale.

Hello Dale

thanks for sharing your point of view.

Would you please rearrange your chart adding arrows showing buy/sell entry points, stoploss and exit points.

thanks

--- 帖子 #191 ---
The AO can be of some help here. Require the bar color to be supportive of the direction before nesting an entry order off of a fractal signal. Remember that a flat look of the extended Alligator balance lines is Bill's preferred entry setup. He is not concerned whether the signal is true or false; that's why he called this setup a "low rent district." Remember too, a fractal cannot give a valid signal unless it is 1) the most recent fractal in that direction and 2) a hit on it would be above the Alligator's teeth if buying; below them if selling.  Requiring that hit to also be above all Alligator balance lines makes a lot of sense to me; certainly when looking at Bill's preferred entry setup.

Hello,

OK - I have attached another chart as requested - with details as to where I would have placed my orders and stop loss.

The only problem with this system (is it a problem - I don't know) is that you can wait for a long long time to get the signals BUT when you do get them you are pretty much in the money BIG TIME!

Because I only started using this system last week I have not received a valid weekly or daily signal as yet and this is where the money is!

I have made on the four hour charts every day though but nothing like what is possible on the daily and weekly charts - can't wait for one of these signals my man!

I cannot demonstrate to you where I take profit purely because I don't know myself yet! Put it this way - on a $50 lot I have been happy to close the position when it has made a $100 - $200 profit BUT every single time I have done this the price has continued to move and in some instances the same lot could have been $1000 profit or more - and that kills me! Like I said - I just have to develop more faith in the system (myself with the system?) so that I can leave the positions open until maturity and this is hard to do!

By the way - I have tried this on 1 minute and 5 minute and 15 minute charts but I have lost pretty much most of the time so for anybody wanting to use this system I don't advocate using it on short time frames - I reckon 4 hours minimum and 1 day and 1 week preferred - on the longer time frames there is less chance (if any) of the trade going against you and the profits are MUCH bigger for much less risk. The only problem with this though is that your stop loss can be HUGE and it takes strength of character to not close out the position because you are getting edgy because the trade appears to be going against you. What is working for me so far (on the 4 hour charts) is: open the position, set the stop loss, and NEVER make it bigger and NEVER close the position UNLESS you want to take profit i.e. do not touch the position until you either take profit or the stop loss is hit. What I do is every hour or so refresh my chart and then move the stop loss closer to the price (I think I mentioned that I use the alligator's lips as the stop loss as per Bill) as per the value of the alligators lips. I am also a great fan of Parabolic SAR so I have this on all of my charts as well and I tend to compare the value of Parabolic SAR and the alligator's lips and use the lesser of the two BUT this depends on what the movements are like in the market i.e. volatile - I use the alligators lips otherwise Parabolic SAR ALTHOUGH this is not ideal because there have been times when the stop set with Parabolic SAR has been hit but the stop that would have been set using the alligator's lips would not have been hit and the position then continued to make profit. Fortuanately even although the stop set using the Parabolic SAR figure is hit the position the position is normally in a profit situation by this stage so profit is taken although it is of course less.

Let's keep this thread going - this system REALLY works (as a matter of fact I read somewhere the other day that it ranks as one of the all time best or 'classic' trading systems - I just can't remember where I saw it but if I find it I'll post the article).

I have not yet plucked up the courage to add to positions as new signals appear in the same (right) direction - don't ask me why - I'm chicken - but again - it will come!

I have tried this system on currency pairs but strangely enough have not made too much but I think it's because of the PIP values - too low for my liking - you are laying out $50 to make maybe $5 - not good risk/reward ration in my opinion - not anymore for me anyway. As a matter of fact only the DAX and the MSCI Taiwan are worth the trouble - even the Dow, S&P, etc. etc. are too little payback. Gold and Silver - also good.

I think the REAL merit of this system is the fact that it does not take market sentiment or any other nonsense into account - that's why it works. The only place where this comes into play is if you use the MFI and even that is technical really not so?

Anway - I am waiting for a setup like on the weekly chart that I posted - it's coming - and when it does - oh man oh man!

Stay in touch.

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thank you Dale.

The only thing I'd like to add is that from my point of view, using Balance Line entry (which is just the opposite of the fractal) will reduce somehow the waiting time

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thank you Larry.

What you said is true.

For me, I see two possible ways of acctions concerning false signals - when AO does not support the move and lines are too close to determine the trend. An entery using large stops which will allow price to drifts until market chooses the direction itself. An entery using tighter than usual stops and re-enter the when price takes fractal again

I know that the only valid is the last fractal, but as Bill said "...everyone is trading his own befieves..."

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hello again,

My pleasure - hope I'm making sense anyway.

I never thought of that BUT are you not supposed to ONLY use the balance line entries AFTER a fractal has been triggered to add to a position?

Actually - while we are on busy discussing this wonderful system I have a question that is not answered anywhere in the books or anywhere else:

Do you ever find that a valid fractal 'disappears'?  I have noticed this on two of my systems (the third does not have fractals unfortuanately).  These systems are at two different brokers (the one is a proprietory version of Metatrader).  In other words - I have placed an order, the order gets executed, and then the position or price starts going in the wrong direction, and the fractal which I based the order price on has disappeared!  Have you seen that before?  At first I thought it was my imagination but it's not and like I say it happens on both systems.  It appears that the trading platforms does the fractal calculations and display them 'on the fly' as it were so that when the system deems that a particular fractal is no longer valid it disappears (or something like that).  I'm not too worried about that BUT I am worried about the fact that I don't know how to handle it i.e. if and when this does happen is that an indication or early warning to immediately close the position regardless of its current profit or loss?

Regards,

Dale.

Hi Dale

I do not consider signals and market as two different things, so generally formation of a fractal is always forming one or more Balance Line signals.

I'll try to explain - let's suppose that:market is in up trend price is above Allegator's lines and 1st fractal has been formed.

Forming the fractal itself means that there is a retrace down at least 2 consecutive bars.

Until price is above the Alligator lines and there is no any other signals we consider that the move is up - so in general each of this 'at least 2 consecutive bars' has an balance line signal.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I see what you mean - you make good points - thanks.

Do you have any input on the 'disappearing' fractals?

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
No fractal cannot disapear once created. This means that you have at least 5 consecutive bars (may be more) and one of them has highest high or lowest low from the group. So until 5th bar is not compleated we cannot be sure that the fractal is valis.

Some softwares or scripts might show fractal on the 4th or event 3rd bar considering this as a help to their customers, but I dobt it is useful...

Metatrader is a great tool and I'm a big fan of it but ...

... if one does not have deep knowledge of the system, relying on some script to do the work, soon or later this behaviour will result significan loss.

I think that this system is so simple and natural that once known, trader does not need any tools to use it but the price...

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I'm not so fast as I would to be

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Thanks a lot for the reply - and you just nailed it!

That's exactly what is happening i.e. both systems are displaying the fractals too soon i.e. not waiting for the fifth bar to complete but displaying the fractal WHILE the fifth bar is forming!  That's VERY dangerous and come to think of it on some of the losing trades that's EXACTLY what has happened i.e. everthing looked good, order executed, and then BAM - fractal disappears and the price turns against you.  Thanks my man!

I don't use Metatrader scripts at all (not to trade anyway - just the standard indicators that come with the package) - I sit in front of this stuff 25 hours a day BUT that's the problem - trading on a daily basis does not give you much to do other than sit and watch which sometimes is not a good thing!

Having said that though - now that you have answered my question about the 'dissapearing' fractals maybe I should carry on with the 4 hours charts and see what happens!

Thanks,

Regards,

Dale.

Here's a sample of possible false signal.

What we currently have is

General down trendBullish Fractal Three Bearish Divergent Bars with not so acute abgle as it should be 68 Fibo level touched 38 retracemtn almost touched Momentum and Acceleration negative

The question is wich signal is false - Bearish Divergent Bars  or Bullish Fractal?

And of course - Why?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Dale,

This remind me something I've red (unfortunately I don't remeber where...)

It was a quotation of a famous trader and it was something like:

"... I've got the bigest profit when I was sitting in my chair and didn't move..."

in other words "...let your profit run..."

I also do not like to stay in fromt of the monitor stairing at what will happen.

This is wny I've wrote some scripts to draw my attention on importent moments... It has lot's of bugs yet but I'm free to do something else once I've made my moves.

Bigger timeframes gives the freedom to enjoy the life while your pocket is filled up

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I have the opposite problem: I LOVE sitting in front of my monitors watching things go on - but that's all you can do - and - wherever you saw that quote - that's me!  You would not believe the amount of times I have closed a trade (or opened a bad trade JUST because I wanted to be 'trading')!

Anyway - I'm over that now (finally).  It's just that sitting around doing seemingly nothing just makes me feel like I'm not working.  It's difficult.

Anyway - I have just received another 'trading classic' - 'New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems' by J. Welles Wilder (been wanting to get it for months now but never got around to it) so that should keep me away from the keyboard long enough to let my Profitunity Trades mature!  I am also waiting for my Second Edition of Trading Chaos and I believe that there are a couple of changes or additions to this system in that book (although I have a feeling that it is just the 'divergent bar' which you already seem to have covered).

Anway - thanks for putting so much time into this thread and your website - stay in touch.

Regards,

Dale.

Hye isto, Good Morning!

Listen - I want to try and start adding to already open (and profitable) positions based on AO, AC, and Balance Lines.

I have attached a daily chart of the MSCI Taiwan. The graph has just updated i.e. new day.

Please check me out here:

According to the system:

1 - AO

There is NO valid buy signal here i.e. according to the system the price would have to drop i.e. red bar then turn up again i.e. green bar for there to be a valid buy signal according to AO. Correct?

2 - AC

There IS a valid buy signal here i.e. according to the system there must be two consecutive green bars and the second bar must be higher than the first for there to be a valid buy signal (which is the case on my chart)? Correct?

3 - Balance Line Trade

Because I am looking for a buy signal only at this point there is no valid Balance Line Trade? Correct?

There is one other thing I am not getting:

Let's assume that I am correct in 2 above i.e. that AC is giving a valid buy signal - the system says to place an order one tick above the price bar that corresponds to the signal bar. Correct? BUT - remember that because this chart has JUST been updated - yes - the AC signal bar is green NOW - but - if the price dropped today - tomorrow this same bar would be red not so? Even if the price continued to move up today but ended up closing lower today - this signal bar would be red tomorrow. Or am I missing something here? If I'm right - what then - this is not explained anywhere in the book (at least - I can't find it)!

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Correct

No, you have four (4) consecutive bars.

Correct

At this point you could ad buy orders because you are in the Green Zone - i.e. both AO and AC are green

Bill recommends adding order on session's close, i.e. you have to place your order(s) either at the end of the session or to ajust to the previous to current bar. This is because the bar is just forming and it could goes either up, down or closes at the open (I mean to go nowhere)

I think that this depends how trader corelate with the market information and this is strogly individual...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hello - thanks for the replies.

So here:

you are saying that the same rule applies as to AO i.e. for AC to be giving me a valid buy signal the price would have to go down now i.e. red bar and then up (1 green bar) and then up again (another green bar) and only then would this be a valid buy signal?

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Dale

Here I quote the "New Trading Dimentions" book because I like its simple and clear definitons.

"A buy signal is created when there are two consecutive histogram bars with higher highs than the most recent lowest low (a down peak).

...

A second buy signal cannot be created until the histogram moves at least one bar lower, creating a red bar. A new buy signal can then be created after two higher (green) bars."

I think this will help you more that my explanations...

Hello Dale

Did you? Would you summarize your experience in figures?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi - how are you doing?

I was just playing around with it yesterday and it could be a 'scalpers' dream (at last on the DAX).

Yesterday I made $605.50 clear just out of the 'scalps' - this is not how I trade normally but I was getting bored and the DAX started moving around like crazy.  I don't recommend doing this unless you are working with a very high volatility instrument and are prepared to take many (small) losses until you are up (once a position has turned into profit make sure that you move your stop OR use a trailing stop).  You also need to find an instrument that is in a strong trend and basically you use the system to buy the 'dips' i.e. you only open positions in the direction of the trend and take profit when they turn into profit.  Then - wait again until the price is going against the trend then buy the dip again.  In other words - let's say the trend is up - when you get a valid fractal sell signal you place a buy limit order one tick below the fractal NOT a sell stop as you normally would.  Get the picture?  Speed of order execution is important so that depends on your broker (and admittedly the broker where I trade the DAX is not particularly fast so if you have a 'fast' broker you should do well).  This is also not a system for newbies (actually I'm not sure it's a system at all).  The reason I say this is that in order for this to be profitable you have to concentrate and can't make a trade and then walk away - you have to drive it otherwise you'll run into problems.  Also - you need to be EXTREMELY fast and very familiar with your trading platform.  As a matter of fact if you do decide to try this you'd be amazed how well the Profitunity System hold together - I mean - if you follow it EXACTLY as you would have on the time frames for which it was intended it's almost as if you are 'cramming' days into minutes.  Even the signals that you get from AO and AC are valid.  The only problem is when you are trying to place orders based on AO of AC - because it is happening so fast it is sometimes impossible to place a stop order one tick above or below the signal bar because the price has more often than not moved past the high or low of the bar by the time you have even entered your order but then you just stay out.

Even although I have tried this and made a few $$$ I DO NOT ADVOCATE USING IT - the Profitunity System is, in my opinion, one of the best and reliable system and to muck around with it the way I have is not the right thing to do (I know that is contradictory to everything I have said above but I don't think that those kind of profits are sustainable).  I just thought that it was interesting to see how well the indicators work on this time frame.

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hi guys.

does this method http://www.forexprofitpro.com/videos...de-videos.html simmilar to what you doing?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
How about that - that's exactly it!

I only looked at the first video (I have already exceeded my 3GB bandwidth cap for the month so I don't want to go crazy in case it affects my trading).

Put it this way - that looks an awful lot like the Profitunity System to me - the only thing I would like to know is what the 'hook' is that they are talking about because that is always my problem i.e. when to take profit.  This really is the only problem I have and it is not the systems fault it's mine.  This system has turned some big profits in the last 9 trading days but some positions have turned to losses because they have been stopped out (I use the alligators lips as a stop loss as per the book) and this is on the long time frames for which it was designed.  Put it this way - I have watched a $700 profit on a single lot turn into a $300 or $400 loss by not taking profit when I should (could) have - if I could solve this problem - things would be good (well - since I've been using this system things are good but they could be even better)!

Regards,

Dale.

Not exactly... look the Chaos System rules here

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I agree with you isto but you have to admit it's probably where their idea came from.

Also remember - fractal analysis is not just a Bill Williams thing - and I'm still of the opinion that you could work with fractals alone - it's just that you would make many more trades and your profits would not be as 'sure' because you would be buying and selling based on every fractal signal i.e. not following any trend but I reckon it could still work.  The original system worked the way it was designed TO THE LETTER still comes out tops!

By the way - how do you take profit?  At what point (and anyone else that cares to throw in their three trillion dollars worth)?

Dale.

OK - well to put that to rest - I signed up for their 'free' trial - and guess what - they actually mention 'Chaos Theory', 'Fractal Analysis', and couple of other things so there you are.

Anyway - I have ten days to give their 'system' a test - if it's any good - I'll let you know (although I have a funny feeling that I know all of this already thanks to Bill Williams and this thread).

--- 帖子 #222 ---
A system might be useful if and only if: it is clearly defined (and explaind why this rules should be applied) it is followed exactly by the trader until it become "its own"

In my belief both issues above must be true.

Only then there is a chance for trader to profit from it.

Each system has some seed of truth - the point is to find them

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I just noticed something fantastic:

Have you ever just zoomed out to a full view of your chart and then had a look at where the fractals are? Man - this is fantastic! The 'fractal' support and resistance lines just jump out at you!

I have always had a hard time with fibo (mainly because you are never sure where to start or where to stop and what constitutes a swing high and what constitutes a swing low etc. etc. etc.) but using the fractals and drawing horizontal lines across them you'd be surprised at how cleary the support and resistance lines pop out!

Edit:

Sorry - I forgot to mention - support and resistance are extremely clear on the shorter timeframes i.e. there are many more fractals being displayed.

Regards,

Dale.

Here you are (I hope this works as I had to 'squeeze' and 'stretch' the chart to make it fit in the allowed dimensions).

What do you think?

You could use it by placing orders either buy or sell one or two ticks above or below the lines.

Dale.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This is another possible explanation of fractals, because

In other words fractals is support and and resistance

--- 帖子 #227 ---
OK - fair enough - all I'm saying is that by drawing the horizontal lines it is very easy to see how many times that support or resistance has been tested - I just find it easier to see than with fibo.

hi isto.

i'm reading bill book and he talk a lot about eliott waves , i didn't see you count wave try to see in what cycle are the market, can you explain why you don't use EW?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
OK 400...

I'll use a quotation from Bill's New Trading Dimentions book trying to clear the matter...

...

Another simplification allowed by using these Balance Lines is that we can trade the Elliott Waves without the necessity for accurate counting. If the current price is outside the Alligator's mouth, we are in an impulsive wave of one degree or another. If the price is meandering around the Balance Lines, we are in a reactive wave of one degree or another.

Hey isto, how's it going?

I have been studying various daily charts and I keep finding that by placing orders only when 'valid' fractals appear you miss out on a lot of very good trades.

Just have a look at my chart (EUR/NOK Daily). You may have made quite a bit on the way up BUT look at the down movement that you would have missed and I am finding this on most of my charts.

I know (think) that this may have something to do with the divergent bar but I don't see it (at least not on this chart).

Any thoughts?

A new Bearish Divergent Bar Setup is visible on USDJPY H4 chart.

If price breaks 123.20 level there will be a nice opportunity to profit...

Another nice Bearish Setup is discussed here

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hello Dale

The best answer I found is again in the Bill's book (I do not considered it as a Bible but explanations in there are very steight and clear  )

If translate the quotation above accourding to your chart it will sounds like:
we do take sell fractal which is formed above the Balance Line, only when at the time it is taken the Balance Line is passed below the fractal level.

Look at the chart - last Bearish fractal is formed above Balance Line and at the time is has been formed is not valid - but when it is taken few sessions later - Balance Line is already above it and the same fractal at that very moment is valid.

Hope I explained it clear ...

--- 帖子 #234 ---

Hey thanks my man.

Got it.

I'm actually quite mad this morning - I ordered a couple of books from Amazon about a week ago and every one of them has arrived EXCEPT the one that I need most and that is my Bill Williams Second Edition!!!

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hey isto,

Hello again.

Like I said - it finally arrived!!!

Anyway (before I start reading) I have a question for you i.e. what would you do do you think?

This morning I placed a sell stop order for USD/NOK on the 4 hour chart.

I always use the value of the Alligator's lip for my stop loss.

The order that I placed this morning was triggered and the price immediately retracted until eventually my stop was hit.

I then had a look at the daily chart (I believe this system works the best on the daily's) and noticed that there was a valid sell fractal that appeared three days ago that was triggered yesterday and although the price retracted immediately after that I would still be in the trade had I have had a sell stop order placed three days ago. So I placed a market order sell immediately. What do you think?

In other words - even if you see a valid fractal late - do you think it's OK to then immediately enter the trade as long as you enter the trade at a place where you would still have been in the trade had you noticed the fractal on time and your stop loss (or at least the place where you would have placed your stop loss had you entered the trade on time) has not yet been hit?

I also have another question about your findings:

I have started to notice (since last Friday anyway) that the moment a stop order of mine is hit the price almost always immediately retracts and of course you are now in a loss situation.  Do you find this happening to you?

I mean - it's driving me crazy - and it is almost as if I should be acting in the totally opposite direction of what the system is telling me.

Regards,

Dale.

who can give indicators for this strategy?

many Thanks

--- 帖子 #239 ---
If your using mt4 platform they are in your regular indicator's.

Accelerator Oscillator

Awesome Oscillator

Alligator

Gator oscillator

Fractals

Moving average 5 sma

You don't need to set any of them (default),

except the moving average......

oopss

sorry for stupid newbie Q

thanks

--- 帖子 #241 ---
OK Dale I'll try to answer 2nd post 1st.

First of all we have to keep in mind that this is a trend system. That means that it is not designed for range trades, i.e. when bars are inside or close around the Alligator.

On the other hand don't take literaly "... put a stop order one tick abobe/below the bar's high/low..." - this push you into situation you;ve described - loosing - especially where price is close aroung lines.

This is not a scalping system - that means you cannot use all the time tight stops because they are aften hit by the volatility.

The question "Where to place stops?" though important, does not have a simple answer - depends on your account, style of trading, pain of loosing, etc.

Hi folks,

For what it's worth - a word:

There seems to be a HUGE difference between the original Profitunity (Chaos) Trading System and the one contained in the second edition of the book. Having only covered the first two or three chapters relating to the system in the past hour or so it is very clear that the original system used the fractals as entry points whereas the system detailed in the second edition of the book uses bullish/bearish divergent bars for entry signals.

Why this makes such a difference is if you read back on my earlier posts today I was finding two things happening:

1 - Once my buy or stop orders were hit the price would almost immediately retrace (which logically, now that I think about it, is quite correct because the fractals actually represent points of resistance so if your order is hit just a few points or pips too early you are actually buying or selling at a point of resistance).

2 - I was also very concerned about the fact that it would appear that a lot of the time you would be missing out on huge rallys.

Basically, the way I read it, in the second edition the fractals are used to add to positions already opened and not for initial entry.

isto: Comments on this?

Edit: Sorry isto - I did not see your reply above when posting this message.  What do you think of my observations though?

Regards,

Dale.

Hi Dale,

In the next two post I'll send my point of view about your charts (post #236).

Please all readers to note that this is just a point of view and I do not pretend to be the only True.

I'd like to underline also that commenting a history chart is completely different than taking a trading decision on the moment signal comes...

I doublt there is a trader at all that didn't face the question:

"How could I miss this obvious signal?!?"

My belief is that the trader must accept error decisions and must know how to act before enter a trade

So let's see the H4 chart.

We have a Bearish fractal that has not been taken until a new Bearish fractal has been formed.

For me this is suspitious showing me that Bulls have enough power to push Bears up and this is sipported by the Momentum wich quickly goes up and crosses the zero line while price is drifting around these fractals...

... and finally enters into the Alligator's lines.

So all short trades have to be closed and / or short stops - to be canceled.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
This post is devoted to D1 chart for the situation discussed in the previous post:

Here the nice long decline ended into a Bearish fractal forming also a nice Bulish Divergent Bar.

Again: short orders should be closed and expect to go long if DBars is confirmed...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Continuing the provious posts here is another sample shonwing that it is time to close all long orders and to avoid either short or long etries

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I hope you'll see the difference between this chart and the chart in the previous post.

Here we have entry into Alligator's Lines but it is supported by Bearish Divergent Bar, strong down Momentum.

First Bearish fractal at the time it has been taken was below red line; down move has been retested and confirmed by forming a new Bullish fractal (2nd one) which is stil not taken...

Let's look what will happen next

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Here is a nice setup triggered during night and offerign a new opportunity for a long entry...

Bullish Divergent Bar has been triggered.
Acceleration and Momentum support up move (currently retracing) and a new long entry around 16560 is forming...

Good luck

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hey isto - how is it going?

I REALLY need some input on what you are doing as far as stops and TP is concerned - this system is starting to kill me now!

Basically - whenever a buy or sell stop is triggered it almost ALWAYS turns into an immediate profit (when using the divergent bar for entry) BUT then, invariably, starts turning into a loss until it gets stopped out. It's now starting to eat it's way through my capital and I just can't see what I'm doing wrong here and I do not want to change systems as I do believe that this one works (based on historical data anyway).

Also - there is nothing mentioned in the book about what happens in the following case:

A bearish divergent bar appears

You place a sell stop one (or a few ticks) below the low of the bar

The sell stop gets triggered

You place a stop loss one (or a few ticks) above the signal bar

You place a buy stop order one (or a few ticks) above the signal bar (same price as the stop loss)

So far - so good

The market goes down in your favour (making a small profit)

The next bar opens and the market starts going against you

Your stop loss and buy stop detailed above get triggered (now a loss on the above position) (by this time a buy fractal has appeared and has just been triggered as well)
Where do you place the stop loss for this newly opened position?

It would appear that in a trending market this works fantastically BUT in a range bound market this thing will finish you off.

BUT, having said that, I am following the system to the letter as detailed in the book and the book specifically says that it should work in any market, any timeframe, and any instrument!

How do YOU determine whether the market is trending or range bound?

Also - it is designed to take things like commentary and market sentiment out of the equation i.e. mechanical trading.

What seems to be becoming clear (unless you can throw some more light on the subject) that this system will set you up to take small loss after small loss after small loss UNTIL a trend starts to develop and you just have to hope that the ensuing trend makes up for all of these small losses when it comes. Would that be a reasonable assumption?

I have tried to contract the Profitunity Website for traders of this system but they are closed (should open today though).

Any ideas or thoughts?

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Sorry - another question - does not seem to be covered in the book:

What if, in the situation described above, while you are in a trade and your stop has not been hit yet, a bullish divergent bar appears?  Do you act on this bar as well?

Actually that's another good question:  The examples in the book are always sort of 'ideal' situations and another thing that is not explained is the following:

Do you only take bearish divergent bars if they are above the alligator and do you only take bullish divergent bars if they are below the alligator?

In all of the examples in the book this appears to be the case but I'm not sure if this is just for illustration purposes or if this is actually the case.

Regards,

Dale.

hi isto.

i'm steel reading bill book , every page i read i understand how why other love this system i'm really enjoy this reading.

i want to ask about some indicators that i saw on your chart that i don't have on my metatrader.

can you please xplain what the use?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
These are just allerts I've made to let me know that something happend on the market. Thay do not exists on MT4...

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Dale

Hard questions you're asking... :surprised

Let's try:

Unfortunately there is no answer like "Put your stop loss here."

Generally there are 3 hard to decide delemas on tradewhen to enter when/where to stop when/where to take profit

Answers of these question depends: on market; on pair; on broker; on your account; on your trading style... Everyone could continue this list.

Let's try a sample - one of the brokers I use has 1 pip spread for EURUSD and 15 for GBPCAD. It is obvious that I cannot use the same distance stop-loss on both, can I?

Another broker has 3 pips spread generaly but during news time spread becomes 25 pips sometimes, so choosing a stop loss here will depend not on pair but on time.

Other situations also exists, but I hope you've got the point

I do not see a reason to avoid a new entry as a workaround ...

If you think about you'll agree that it is not possible to cover all situations that live trade offers.

This is only the system. As anything else in the world it has good and bad part.

This best advantage of this particular system is that it is clear and clarifies what happens on the market not caring why this happens... It is just a style of trade and Bill is kind enough to share it with us.

Somewhere is his books he said:

... each trader trades his own believes ...[and] ... this is why even if one is trading side by side the very same method with very same rules the result will differ.

I quote this by hart and the words might be different but you get the point, don't you?

Yes this is right in the center of 10! This is why he has written Trading Chaos 2nd Edition offering Divergetn Bar as alternative tool for ranging market.

I personally use Alligato and Gator (available in MT4)

I do not believe in mechanical trading - market is live thanks to the traders - if mechanical trading is at all possible that meand that exchanges will become a large robot factory and profit will disapear...

There is no one single trader without a loss. You'll face losses, small or large. It doesn't matter how many they are - important is to keep them smaller than your profit - obvious, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Each trade is unique... Situation on the market is also... So as I've said - it depends on lot's of things - one of them is experience and it comes with practice, practice, practice, practice, ....

Think about - would be better if when you look on the sample you start wondering "which one is that fractal? this bar?, No,No - that one!, Am I sure? may be the last bar or it will appear on the next new bar???" or

"place order where distance is exactly 3 pips, but here put your order only if you have 6 pips, but there you'll need 10 or 15 pips"...

The aims of the books are to show you the core of the system and of caurse there should be some samples that must be clear enough to understand descriptions.

He did this brilliantly and in an easy to understand way - this is wht he has so much fens.

You cannot expect that when you finish reading you'll start trading like a Pro.

Everyone needs learn, practice, analyse, think, correct and begin from the beginning...

Sorry for this long postings... I did them because I hope they will clear somehow this system...

--- 帖子 #254 ---
hi guys, mabye we got a programer here that can help us to print the bars like bill said in is book

"Set up your computer so that (1) when both the AO and the AC are higher than their immedi- ately preceding bars, the corresponding price bar will be colored green, and (2) if both the AO and the AC are lower than their immediately preceding bars, the corresponding price bar will be colored red. If the AO and the AC are different colors, set up the price bar to be gray. You can then read the zone color directly on the price bar.
"

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hello isto - and thanks for replying to each and every one of my questions.

I did manage to find in the book (second edition) an exit strategy (that is not working for me but it's there anyway):

Basically when a new signal appears in the opposite direction i.e. when you are long and a bearish divergent bar appears you stop and reverse and visa versa for a short position.

Something else that has come to mind:

I noticed the post looking for a programmer that could program the stuff for AO and AC.  My question is this:  which edition of the book or system are you using?  I have just received the second edition and I can tell you that nowhere is AC used at all.  Does anyone know (isto) if this was a change to the system by Sir Bill or are the methods used in the second edition supposed to be used in conjunction with the first edition?  Which edition / version do you have / are you working with (isto)?

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
If you search google I think you'l find such an expert - I had found somewhere but do not keep a copy of it - it does colored bar in this fasion but...

you could use AO and AC - when both are grean - you have green bar; when both are red - you have red bar and when one is red and the other green you have gray bar.

Speaking other words these are Zones...

As I said before coloring itself do not help if you do not understand the system...

You can also seatch at metaquotes.net - there is some experts posted there...

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Well, I could answer for myself:

I decide whether to reverse or not on each trade - I do not have rule for that...

I'm sorry for this vague answer, I wish I have all of them ...

Trading Chaos 2nd. but I have all the books...

Yes you've noted this correctly.

No I do not know (and francly I do not care). I look at his books as consecutive volumes of this system. For me it does not make sense in the next book to repeat everything from previous one ...

My point of view is that next book develops further the system. Otherwise he certainly would emphasize that this is a new system...

hi guys.

I think we may have a nice opportunity on the Canadian.

as you know this currency got wild this couple of days , and now I think is time to correction, I will follow the daily.

I will wait first for fractal brake and than to a green bar and jump in , I will use a large stop because it could be a roller coaster.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi fxcellent

Well about the brokers I don't want to name them not because I've something to hide but I think that: Each broker has strengths and weeknesses... Each trader have to choose very carefully the borker it use. I do not want to push anybody towords one or another service

I'm sitting in the chair more than I like to, but I'm not full time trader. This is why I prefer H4 timeframe allowing me to glance at the charts few times per day for about 15 min.

Sometimes I have time to follow price move longer...

I've started with EURUSD but now I follow almost every pair offered (they differ) by the borker (well, almost because you see POLNOK pair is not so volotile...)

unfortunately I do not have sumarized data for trades about the last month. Basically I do not believe much on such statistics.

For me the inly valid one it where is your account balance - must be positive! Otherwise better go for a drink

Additionally I have shortage with free time to keep all writtings in order...

Thank you. I doubt Bill have ever heard about ...

I'm not honoured to meet him and my only acquaintance is by his books but this is quite enough for me to respect him very much.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Entire post is 267.

I would like to mention only that meanwhile there are 5 (five) Bearish Fractals break down...

Momentum failed to break the zero line.
Acceleration is down for few sessions already.
Alligator is opening...

But because for the 21 sessions range this first break could be false one...

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Greetings Isto, and everyone else who follows this thread,

I thought I'd weigh in with a setup that is occuring on the GBP/USD 4hr chart:

As you can see in the attached image, price has been heading steadily up for a while.  There were two bearish divergent bars at the top of the run, followed by another retest forming a triple top right at a significant resistance point: 2.0200.

In addition to the triple top, the AO (Momentum) and AC (Acceleration) have both been red for a while.  That means positive momentum is dropping and prices are starting to accelerate downwards.

There was a strong move down earlier today which closed below a previously invalid fractal point.  It was invalid, at first, because prices were still above the alligator's teeth (the red line).  It became valid, however, because at the time the price fell to hit the fractal point, price was below the red line.

I waited for a close below the fractal.  I know that the Profitunity books all talk about putting orders "one tick below", but I have seen prices go and hit that one tick below only to go the other direction.  Waiting for a close below the fractal point is a lot safer in my book.

My next order is waiting just below the bar I entered on because, in addition to hitting the sell fractal, it was also a "Red Zone" signal with both the AO and the AC the same color.

We'll see how this shapes up.  It looks good, though.  I'm worried about NFP tomorrow, though.  As long as it is good news for the USD I should be okay.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hey isto - and TommC - thanks for that message.

TommyC:

I'm glad I'm not the only one that has noticed this.  And - with me (on the DAX) it ALWAYS goes in the other direction i.e. not only sometimes!!!

I have been doing a lot of research into this phenomenon and I don't know if you are familiar with pivot points BUT in my case - every time there is a fractal signal - you can be sure that it is on a pivot point or pivot support or resistance level and it's been driving me nuts - to the point where I am tempted to place buy stop orders where Profitunity is telling me to place sell stop orders and visa versa!!!

You say that you wait for a close below or above the fractal.  At what point do you place your buy or sell orders then - and what type of orders are you placing i.e. limit, stop, or market orders in the direction of the fractal?

Regards,

Dale.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Actually, that's a good question. If I am waiting for a close below a fractal point, I will usually make a point to be watching the market at the time the candle completes. If it completes beneath the fractal, or if I can tell several minutes before the bar completes that it WILL close beneath the fractal, then I just place a market order.

Sometimes you can't be there, so I will place either buy or sell stops, but I usually prefer to be there when the candle updates. I don't trade anything less than the 4 hr chart, though so, even on days when I am working, at the most I only miss two candle updates a day.

As an update to the GBP/USD trade I entered into yesterday, as you can see from the attached chart, through the London session, last night, price had been slowly working its way down. Then, when NFP came out better than expected, price started to really move down. Needless to say I was quite happy about that. But, as soon as it started down it began retracing. Thankfully it didn't retrace too far, though. The end result is that it sort of went nowhere.

Looking at where it ended up for the week, price is below the alligator, so the tone is bearish: take all sell signals and ignore bull signals (except for the bullish divergent bar!?). AO is still moving down and is actually negative. AC, on the other hand, is negative but accelerating up.

In the end, I hope that this is just the market breathing a little: after the big move down on Thursday, and NFP, the GBP just needs to gather its strength before continuing to fall. We'll just have to see what next week brings.

Hi to everybody.

Here is an interesting H4 chart of USDCAD.

On the same bar we have Bulish Divergent Bar and Bearish Fractal setups.

Bulish Divergent Bar is supported by triple botoms and slowing Acceleration from the one side and an visible acute angle on the other.

Bearish Fractal has been taken (few pips though, but taken),  movement could continue down...

Because each setup has its pros stop orders are placed on each side for the setup bar.

Let's see how will develop this chart

--- 帖子 #274 ---
"Because each setup has its pros stop orders are placed on each side for the setup bar."

taking account of bullish divergent bar , placing buy above bdb and placing sell below the fractal , is it the scenario u are talking about , now bearish fractal broken but not valid break and now market reached the buy order of bdb. so under the circumstances both have been touched what is the step be taken to or what u have taken so that future analysis will give additional input to us

thank u

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Well, probably every trader see different things on the same chart

Here is current situation on my chart.

Short stop order is still pending; long has been taken.

Currently 1.0515 level is testing. If it breaks up we'll have some profit. For this reason a new long stop order is placed above that level...

Because signals are still in opposite directions stop loss is placed just below the previous session's bar.

Let's see where we are going

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Here's a trade I just got into this morning on the GBP/JPY.  As you can see from the slide, I missed the entry on Wiseman #1, the bearish divergent bar.  So I waited for Wiseman #2, three red AO bars.  It has, obviously, triggered my buy stop, which was placed 5 pips below the low of the candle on the third red AO bar.  The trade is doing very well right now.  As I write this I am up 78 pips.

I did not take the signal from the most recent down fractal because, when price crossed it, it was still above the red line.  My next entry will be below the low of this bar, because this down bar will have both a red AO bar and a red AC bar (Zone trade).

I also went short on the EUR/JPY, one entry off of Wiseman #2, and a second entry off of a sell fractal.  I don't have time to post the chart (because I have to, sadly, go to work), but I will try to get it up later today.

The GBP/USD trade I posted a couple of days ago has gone the other way on me.  It triggered an up fractal, so I stopped and reversed.  That trade is up 16 pips now.

Isto -- the USD/CAD trade setup looks good.  I was concerned about how it would react to the rate hike this morning, but it must have already been factored into the price, because the price on the pair has actually gone up and not down as you might expect it to on an increase in CAD intrest rate.  I hope it works out well for you.  I'll be watching it.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Today EURUSD has waked and broked up the bunch of Bullish fractals offering nice profit.

For me it was a surprise (though I've placed buy stop orders  )

Momentum and Acceleration (and CAD probably) support the move so we are in with a nice profit locked.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Here is a classic Bearish Divergent Bar trading sample.

It also confirmes that rules must be followed!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Well the trade I got into, this morning, has been shaping up rather nicely. You can see, from the attached chart, that I now have two positions open, with a third sell stop waiting, and I am anticipating a fourth sell signal later this evening after the asian open. Actually, I should already have three positions open, but I missed the bearish divergent bar entry.

Even still, my first postion is +150 pips, my second position is +27, and my third position just got triggered as I am typing this.

Hopefully, all will go well.

My GBP/USD trade is up, too. I haven't attached a chart, but the main position is +96 pips, and the second position is -11 right now.

I also have shorts on the EUR/JPY at +65, +55, and +25 pips.

On the whole, I must say that I am very satisfied with the Profitunity approach and the ability to take advantage of market turns from the very beginning, extract as much profit out of the move by aggressively adding on lots as postions become profitable, and then listening to the market for the correct time to exit.

As Bill Williams says, there is a 'Holy Grail" of trading: "want what the market wants". And, for me, the Profitunity "trading chaos" approach helps me get in tune with the market and be ready for whichever way it wants to head.

Hi isto,

After reading about the chaos system in your thread, I have read New Trading Dimensions. I would say that not only your thread is excellent, but you also seem to be a disciplined trader.

After reading so much about the system, I feel like using the system for my personal trading.But as soon as I wanted to enter the market , Many doubts came in my mind. I hope you can help me out.

I have labelled Up Fractals as UF1,UF2 and Down Fractals as DF1, DF2, DF3

and few bars with a,b,c,d,e,f labels so that it will be easy to refer to a particular bar.

1)    Since the divergent bar (DF1) is right inside the  mouth of the alligator, Should we enter long when high of this Divergent bar is crossed by bar labelled a ?

Can we say that bar (DF2) is a divergent bar ?

In case we take signal on Divergent bar (DF1) or Divergent bar (DF2)

where should we place the stop, below red line or low of divergent

bar or below the nearest fractal (DF2)

2)   You would have noticed that on bar (a) we are getting multiple signals

there is fractal buy, AO signal , Zone Signal , AC Signal( I am not sure

if AC signal is correct for this bar )

so which signal should we take, or we should take all the signals ?

At which bar we should have taken AC signal ?

Since all these signals are in a small range of few points, we could end up having  big position at similar price. and if stopped out it could lead to a substantial loss, what is your suggestion ?

3)    bar (a) to (e) are in green zone, As per the zone rule we are supposed to add positions on close of these bars, But bar (c) and (d) do not make new highs, so should we add position on  close of bar (c) & (d) as per zone rule ?

4)    on bar (e) we have fractal buy and balance line signal at the same point

so which signal should we take ?

thanks and regards

tej

I was looking at your chart and I see that you have some custom zone indicator that shows whether or not AO & AC are both red or green at the same time.  That's really cool!  Do you mind posting that indicator for the rest of us?  It would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks so much.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Well tej, this chart has two major points that would make me to postpone trade. Alligator is intertwined - this means there is no trend at this point Divergent bars must be away from alligators lines

So based to the above said I would either tighten the stops if I'm in a trade or will stay out until a trend appears.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Tommy,

Sure , You can use this indicator, I had written this indicator to help me to identify the zones.

This indicator is written in Metastock formula language. So it will work in Metastock. But with small changes it should work in other charting software also.

If you are using Metastock then I can upload this indicator for you or you can copy/paste the following code in indicator builder.

This indicator consists of three parts

Zone_Green

If(Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AC Green") AND Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AO Green"),1,0)

Zone_Red

If(Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AC Red") AND Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AO Red"),1,0)

Zone_Grey

If((Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AC Green") AND Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AO RED") ) OR (Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AC RED") AND Fml( "Profitunity - PTG AO Green") ),1,0)

Hope this will help you.

regards

Hi isto,

Thanks for your input. I was doubtful about the divergent bars, so I had not taken this signal.

But I had bought on breakout of 1st fractal, bcoz this fractal was above the red line. Was this action correct as per the rules ?

But since so many signals came at sametime I didnot take other signals. Though as per the Book we are supposed to take all signals after first fractal is taken out. I need your advise in this matter, i.e. what should one do if multiple signals are triggered at same price or within a small range of 5 to 10 pips. Place orders for multiple lots or just one lot ?

I have small confusion over Zone Signals. As you will notice that bar a,b,c,d,e are all in green zone. that means we should buy on the close of each bar ?

But Bar c & d have lower highs compared to previous bars, Is zone signal valid for these bars c & d ?

This trade is in profit so far, I have attached the chart. Now where should i place my exit ?

Should I wait for a close below Red Line or Below the low of Down Fractal (DF3) or is there any other method for early exit ?

Eagerly Awaiting your guidance

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #296 ---
yes it is.

I would enter on UF2 break.

Generally - yes each signal have to be taken.

But it depends on the timeframe you're trading. Smaller one will producw much more signals. If you have to take them - depends on lots of factors (one of them is your account balance  )

yes, we should buy on the close of each bar until there is not signal for direction change...

but again there are lots of factors that must be considered...

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Isto,

I just reread New Trading Dimensions a few weeks ago, and I am pretty sure that, with respect to zone trades, the book says that you buy on the close of green AO and green AC as long as the bar has a higher close than the bar before it.  So, if a green/green situation comes up, but the candle has a lower close than the candle before it, it would not be taken.  But, if green/green happened on the next bar, and that bar had a higher close, then you would buy on the close at that point.

At least I think that's what the book says... I could be wrong.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Probably you are right. This make sense.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hello everybody! Finally i got a chance to scratch some things here.

First of all, thanks Isto for your explanation of Chaos Theory!

Ok, now about me... i am using Bill's ideas from april. And till this moment i have found 2 problems

1) If i enter when price hit fractal signal... then i will loose to much movement

2) And actually i dont know where to place take profit... Becos if i wait till the red line, i will surely loose half of my profit.

Idea with DB is really new for me. And it really rocks.... but sometimes it is really hard to understand whether this bar DB or not. So could you please explain again..... and if it is possible on my picture

As i can see on this picture, the last white bar is Bulls DB... or maybe i am wrong?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
The concept of the bullish/bearish divergent bar is a tough one to grasp.  It took me quite a while, too.  When looking at the chart you posted, the last white bar would NOT be a bullish divergent bar.  True, it is away from the alligator's mouth; true, there is angulation with the blue line (alligator's jaw); but in order to be a bullish divergent bar, it has to make a new low and also close in the upper half of the bar.  That particular bar, while it did close in the top half of the bar, did not make a lower low than the bar before it.

It takes some practice, but after a little while the bullish/bearish divergent bars will, literally, jump right off the page at you.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Aha i think you are right... becos now price is going lower and lower.... and AC turned to red zone... and also momentum is going down.... So i hope i will get some profit from this position http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

As i understood DB should have lower low than previous bar and should close in bottom half... thats right? (for Bullish DB)

Also another question... Where should i put stop order? maybe near fibbo levels?....

And another question... if we look on that chart again previous high... Was it DB or not?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Tommy_C

And also you said that there is a good angle....  How did you find  that? becos if i put line through the highs of bars and line showing the way of red line the will be nearly the same.... could you please draw the angle on my picture... of course if it is possible

--- 帖子 #303 ---
In brief:

To have a Bearis divergent bar you need significant distance from lines (red) acute angle price to close inot the lower half of the bar

Look at the chart we have all the three and sonn after the price is diving

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks everybody for the explanation!

Here what i draw by my self... could you please check it

And also any recomendations for current situation on the chart. Currently i am in short possition from 36.14.

I think that AO is in red condition for too long... and here might be a throw up.... or maybe i am wrong? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif

--- 帖子 #305 ---
In general this setup seems suspicious to me nevetheless DBars seem valid...

Look at the Alligator. I cound 35 session intertwining lines. This is anything but trend.

It is obvious that market makes attemts to get out for thi balance state is not acceptable any more, but stil "Alligator is sleeping".

Divergent bar might appear on a trend only - this whole method is about the trend only. Signals out of a trend must be ignored.

So all this fractals and Dbars on this chart at this moment are only signal showing that something is on its way to happen but this "thing" is not out and it is not clear what will be - Bull or Bear.

So I'd stay away for this moment...

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks Isto, but here another 5 cents.

On the chart i see double top...  Also i checked daily chart and it seems that we are writing right shoulder....

And also another question... if i stay out of market, when should i enter? after hitting fractal? but it might be far too long... becos  market will make a fast move....

BTW i use 1 hour time frame

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Well Protei,

I doubt anybody could answer your questions. Bill Williams few times underlined in his books that "every trader trades his own believs".

On the same chart two traders see two different lanscapes and got different signals.

I mentioned mine: For me basic is the trend because this is a trend method. So first we have to have trend; then we have to have fractal and when it is break in trend direction we enter.

Yes, you could miss some move, yes it might be too late, but think about which is first: to enter the trade to win the trade

It doesn't matter for me whether there is move or not. I cannot guess where the price will be, or how long it will move, or whatever else concirning the future.

I can only consider the signals that are already on the chart and to decide: Are they enough for me to enter, what is the risk, is it acceptable for me.

If I answer yes I put stop order. If not - look around for the next move...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Here is another sample that I'm sure will divide traders at leat into two groups.

What should trader do next? Sell or Buy?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
My oppinion is you should sell lower than Dbars... AO and AC are green for sometime... so they probably will change in the nearest future

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Isto,

Thanks for the detailed reply.

Can you explain the rules for 3AO signals... ?

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Tommy,

Thanks for taking part in the discussion regarding Zone Signals....

Such discussions help everyone in the group...

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Tej,  i think 3AO signal is ... mm how to say.... Ok for example: we have an up trend and AO is below zero, but it is going up. So after 3 green Bars of AO below zero we should put a stop buy higher than previous bar.... I think thats it http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon3.gif

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi tej

3AO are 3 green acceleration bars below zero on a down trend, or

3 red acceleration bars above zero on a up trend.

This is a signal that trend is slowing and might turn around so it is used to enter in the opposite direction...

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hey Isto

I have a question about your diagram from http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=286

Here we can see  a bullish bar... but alligator is nearly closed.... so this Dbar must be fault.... or i am wrong.. becos on my chart situation is the same.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
EURNZD Dbar setup is forming.

Comments are available here.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
OK Protei,

First I'd like to confess I'm not a guru, neither I pretend to be. I cannot predict the future. As I said everyone trades setups he/she believes to see on chart

Here I'll try to answer your question.

I've commented what I see and my believes what will happen there.

As for mine you quote - I see few differences

on mine:last 3 sessions lines are opening widely last bar breaks a trippe top or head & shoulders (whichone you prefer)

At your chart:price few times failed to tale previous fractals on 10 12:00 and  12 12:00 If the bullish DBar behind 12 12:00 was strong enough I should take bearish fractal at leat at 12 12:00. If you look back you'll see that this 36.00 level is strong support/resistance level because almost all bars on the chart are gravitating around. Neither spike succeed breaking that level. There is some move but price all the time returns to 36.00.

This shows to me (this is my own belief) that something happens and there is no more (probably) consensus about this balance level (36). But on this chart I cannot see definitely which why the price is going to follow.

I (personally) need another signal that will confirm that price is taking Bear or Bull path.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
So okey... lets see how the situation turns on my chart.

Today this blue chip continued to go down. And price at this time is 35.6

So my ideas for this moment... Fibbo level 0.764 was broken. And maybe next target is 1   Who knows....  But! AO is red for a long time and AC is red also for 3 sessions.. so the situation is really not good... and soon we might get a Bullish DB.  So i think i will tighten my stop losses...  maybe i will put them on 35.75.... in this case i will be in a profit. becos 2 lots from 36.2 and 4 lots from 35.9 and 1 lot 35.65

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thanks Isto! I think you are right...

but today i was lucky and price finally got fractal  35.86.... so price is going down.. and i hope to see it somewhere near last bottom

Also i agree that we see usually different things...  but somehow we could find a right decision together

Ok, Thanks for help! i will write later how the situation turns

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Here is what happens with AUDJPY (post #308).

Bearish Divergent Bars are too weak - there is almost no angle. Acceleration and Momentum are up.

So for the moment there is not signs for reverse...

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Isto 1 more question about your last chart. Some of bearish DBars look strange... becos they closed in the top half.... is this correct? becos i thought that Bearish DBar should close in bottom half

Ah Isto sorry... i was wrong... now i see that it is Bearish DBars....

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I see 5 and all close in the lower half...

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi isto & protei

Thanx for the explanation.

Please tell me whether I should look for 3 AC bars  or 3 AO bars

bcoz AC shows  acceleration & AO shows momentum.

If we enter on 3AO signal, we will be entering against the trend,  In such

case where should we place our Stop Loss.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #323 ---
i think 3AO signal is addition to Dbar.... so After you got triggered Dbar... first signal that will come is 3AO signal... and i think you can buy on it 5 lots... And so you will have 6 lots! and this is pretty nice!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
So lets see how it was going.

In the middle of the day the price made double bottom, and also there were 5 red bars (this mean AC and AO were moving in the same direction). I put stop loss on the level 35.475 and it was triggered at first grey bar (Ac began to grow). After that  the price went higher and higher and closed near fibbo 0.382. Till this moment i have 2 lots, One was oppened at 35.475 and another 35.6..... Green bar is saying that price will surely go higher.... but will it in really i dont know  . Anyway i put stop loss at 35.56. Also as it can be seen on chart there were no Bullish Dbars.... So situation is kinda curious.

Will see what will happen tomorrow

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Another chart of blue chip is shown.

So what we have here.... 16.07.2007 16:00 were created nice Bullish bar, after which price went down. So i put stop sell signal lower than this bar and it was triggered (1 lot at 224.3 ). Another signal came todays morning. So i got 5 more lots at 222. But in the middle of the day situation changed and price stopped on fibo level 0.382. So after few ticks i decided to put stop 221.5 and it was triggered. So i got not a big profit... but i got it

Okey Alligator closed his mouth. And now we should wait. Stop buy i put little bit higher than previous maximum. And now there will be no stop sell.

My opinion is that soon here will be tripple top... and after price will make down trend  . Will see

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi tej

3AC is just a signal the it trend might reverse.

3AO are the second signal after Divergent Bar is validated (and hit)

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Isto, did you try to trade commodities using Bill's ideas?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi isto,

That means we should take 3AO signal, only if Divergent Bar is formed.

In case market turns without making a Divergent bar. We should avoid

such 3AO signals.

I have attached a chart , pls tell whether 3AO signal is valid here ?

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Well i am not Isto but on first look... i think its not a valid signal, btw i think price will go higher in some moment and alligator will close. After alligator will close you will have at least 2 fractals... up and down... So you will know what to do next

On this chart i think we see the end of the upper trend.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
no because I cannot find a broket I like...

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Aha i see... and i also didnt find a good broker for a Forex in Russia....  and also i am affraid of that high shoulders like you have on Forex

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Well tej, I do not take so literally the rules.

Signal is signal. Bill Williams advise not to take a signal when price is in Alligator's mouth.

There are some other recommendations in his books about whether to take or not a signal.

Nevertheless this method has clear rules there are lot's of subjective points during decision making.

Finally again we touch to the same point: What trader see on the chart.

If you see a signal, evaluate cons and pros and if seems to be valid take the signal.

As for the chart I (personally) will not take the signal while price is in or close to Alligator

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Well I do not have anything in common with Russia...

What I mean was the conditions and contracts that (stock) brokers offer. This is a complicated question and when it comes to leagal matters one should open its eyes wide to read carefuly the paper and to consult with pros before to take a decision to grant its own money to somebody else (broker)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Well i understood what you had said   This problem we have here....  Too many papers you should read and sign..... and broker might hide something there.... Only a professional could help.

Also Isto... how is your demo account.... does bill work?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Nice explanation  Protei

lets see what market tells us in future...

thanks

tej

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi Isto,

thank you , you have really mastered Bill Williams System !

I think many members like me can learn quite a lot from you

Personally, I prefer to learn the rules first ... so that I don't make mistake

while taking decisions.

I always try to remove as much subjectivity as possible.

I know trading cannot be made 100% mechanical but being objective helps to take decision easily.

I am facing a problem while trying to draw angle for divergent bars

Can you tell me where should we place the starting point, bcoz on charts it seems that we can start the angle from anywhere.

I have attached a chart where Bearish Divergent bar has been formed today.

It is away from Alligator line

I think angle is acute....

Maybe you can draw and show the correct angle.

Also give a comment on wrong way of drawing the angle.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I think something like this should be...

--- 帖子 #338 ---
fine for last month is up (I post it from time to time)...

But stil to many falst signals I could not get rid of...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Maybe you can post your trades with false signals, becos all situations that i saw here were profitable.... we will discuss them and try to find a solution... i will also post mine. Becos i also have wrong entrys.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
This seems correct approach to me too.

Go back to beginning of the move (where price is in or near the MAs) and draw line below the lows for up trend and above the highs for down trend

I've attached a sample.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
OK I will.

I doubt there is a trader without losses

--- 帖子 #342 ---
But amount of losses should be less than amount of profits

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Here is a 420 loss from today.

I've entered on 2 green AC signal neglecting long green series in AO.

Fortunately after Bearish DBar I've tighten the stops hit on the next session.

Here is a question: Should I close on close of DBar (and reverse?) or just tighten the stops and look next move?

Now you see to pending orders - Bullish Fractal and Bearish DBar

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Absolutely!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Thnx for such a clear and simple method.

Do you think it is ok to take this trade ...  if mkt trades below divergent bar..

I hope I have not missed something on this chart

On one hand  AO & AC are green.... that means price is accelerating

and momentum is also strong.... And we are trying to go short.

But on the other hand this could be begining of new move  or

maybe a correction...

Your Suggestions and View is Important to me......

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Well you made everything right.... like Bill say... but i think you tightened your stops too close.

I will put stop near 1.3730, becos as i can see chart dont have any new information. So the price will fluctuate near 1.3735 (where speed of bars began to decrees) and 1.3780.  Of course this is risky.. and you might loose some money...  but in some cases you might get profit

Also another point for growth is that there is no divergence on AO... so price might grow further.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I do not want to advise because this means to predict what will happen next. I can not.

here is a sample with my decision on some sort of similar (not much though) situation - post #343

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hey Isto! you are on a plus side... and made nearly $2500...  This is very good for 1 day! I wish all my days was like yours.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
yes you're right - I've tighten the stops too much perhaps.

I hesitated somewhat because of the arguments you've mentioned but two of them prevailed: too long green AO sequence Bearish Divergent Bar

and the profit I've got from the move so far...

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I wish it to you too  .

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Well i think the rule is: Think 3 times before accepting signal, when AO is green for a long time and AC is going down.

Actually Isto in such a situation like yours but on a down trend i also tightened stops too close and got profit.... you can see it on charts that i posted recently...

On my charts the price was consolidating near level 35.35... and there were no information for 2 hours... but then came information (it was statistic from the USA PPI core etc....) and price went up....

And also another thing.... in your current situation i think you should also open short position.... but stop (if price goes higher) with inverting you should put little bit higher than bearish DBar

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi isto,

First : Pls understand , I am not trying to comment on your trade

But i am trying to learn !

I would like to share my viewpoint. Whenever I have faced such difficult situation. I try to resolve it with the help of Rules of the System.

And if i still have any doubt. I prefer to resolve it with Risk / Reward ratio

I believe in any trade our potential Reward should be at least 2 time the risk we are taking.  [ Bcoz our Main Aim is to Make Money ]

In the above case, I can think of following 4 scenario's

i) There has been a vertical rally... mkt may undergo some correction may be upto 23.6% or 38.2% fib ratio. Since we are getting an

entry near the top.... our risk/reward ratio should be better than 1:2

ii) This might the begining of a new down trend.... [ V could hope for  bigger profits ]

iii) Market might just be taking rest and it may remain sideways and resume it's journey upward, then we will get an entry on the break of bullish fractal.

iv) Worst possible case.... mkt may hit both the triggers, first down, then up

and finally go down...

So, I would prefer to go short...... bcoz risk/reward is favourable....

This is my personal view.... You can correct me wherever I am wrong..

Hi Protei,

Nice tip for placing stops to avoid whipsaws...

Lets give stops some breathing space.... so that they are not hit

by normal volatility of the market...

But on the flip side.... [ if stops are hit... we shall lose more......]

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Tej.... yup you are right...  Putting stop little bit far of course will get your profit down in some situations... but on the other hand it might help you continue going with trend after market will have a short rest.  So there are many factors that should be taken on account

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi tej

I'll try to answer your questions

learnign is one of the action that I admire very much

As to comments - everybody is free to comment whichever aspect of the thread (I prefer positive though )

I think that Risk / Reword could be considered after the trade is closed. Trying to calculate any ratio during the trade, or even before to enter it is waste of time (this is my point of view).

Because it you do, this means that you can predict what the market will do, where will go, how long will move. If you can - you do not need any system. If you cannot - this is loss of time.

Shure the main purpose is to make money... These are rules for - we are blind for the future (at least some of us ) - so rules tell us:

if this and this happen (rule), act so and so (obey the rules)

Rules are created (usually) after long observation and reflect some repleating behaviour of the price under definite conditions.

But when market is bored it changes this repleating behaviour and this is why it does not work 100% of the time. (let's say some news is comming on)

Then traders have to face some losses...

The last sentance is totally wrong! (sorry)

I prefer to get profit without risk at all or without trading at all

But this is not up to our preferences...

Here the preferences are issued and done my the market.

We have two choices:be prepared whatever market decides don't be prepared (act under personal preferences)

If we act according our preferences and do not care about market's guess who will be the winner and who the looser?

you've listed some opportunities (correct or wrong, it doesn't matter here, now). Be prepared for each of them. This way your chances (to win oe lose) increase from one to four (as you've listed them).

Sorry for the long post, I believe all these are important...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Absolutely agree with Isto.  And here is an example. When i began to trade using Bill's system i was thinking aha..... market will go here so i will put stop buy here and i'll be rich... but market went down... where i had no signals at all... i was really ashmed... how this can happen...  Now i am making both signals for both situations. And trying not to look in the future, but sometimes it is really hard to make

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Here is a setup I've missed.

Bullish divergent bar was so small that I've missed it. I was focused on Bullish Fractal and dodn't place sell order...

Just now I noticed Head & Shoulders formation. Acceleration is down last few sessions and let's see what will happen on 167.75 support...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Isto have you put stop sell lower that 167.75?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Not yet. It depends whether 3AO will be taken

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Well but actually if price go on this leve, it will be taken.  So i suggest you to put signal lower... and also another point... this level is Level of support... and if it is taken... then price will go lower. this is just 1 situation that may happen....

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Okey lets get back to our chickens

On this chart today happened a GAP   and all profitable possitions turned to losses. How i hate that GAPS!!!!! Okey but chart hitted my stop and i turned on the short side... from 35.25 with 1 lot... and later on 35.15 got 4 more lots... now i have 5 lots on short side.  what will happen next i dont know... Actually we need more information.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Okey another chart (blue chip ROSN).

Here we have a tripple top... and if price will brake level 219 i will surely open stops.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
And finally blue chip GAZP

Here i had stop sell on 285.8... and it was triggered.. but now price is going higher.... i think i made a mistake that put stop sell so high... i should put it somewhere lower than 215...  But any case i have 20 stock of it now... and will wait.... stop loss is on the high.....

Aha and also i can see here a tripple top and both AC and AO are going down.... So i think Support will be broken! And also on the head we had a Bearish DB

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Any comments?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Previous session diving hit stop loss causing some loss.

Let's see 1.3755 support how strong is

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Isto i think this support level is very hard to get... but with some luck and of course information... price will get it... and then i think you could open short position with 3 lots  Just my thoughts

Here NZDJPY on daily chart offers a nice trade puzzle

From the one side we have bunch of Bearish Divergent Bars versus a Bullish Fractal on the other;

Double tops versus Green Zone (Strong Momentum and acceleration up)

Let's see where will go next

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi isto,

As per our discussion yesterday about the Divergent bars.

I finally made a decision to follow the signal as per the system

and went short below the low of the Bearish Divergent bar and place a stop  loss few ticks above the top of the Bearish d bar.

But today market has given us new information by forming a Bullish Divergent bar.

I need your help to analyse this new information provided by the market.

My current dilemma is how to make use of this new input . I am having following doubts, Please guide which is correct. If all are wrong pls give your answer, i.e. what should one do in such condition.

i) Close  short position, if mkt trades above the Bullish Divergent bar

ii) Close short position and reverse the trade , if market trades above Bullish d bar

iii) Nothing has changed, maintain the old stop loss. i.e. on other side of Bearish Divergent bar.

iv) If price crosses the top of bearish divergent bar, then close and reverse the position , bcoz that will also be a balance line signal.

awaiting your guidance

regards

tej

i would prefer 3 variant.... becos Bullish DBar is invalid.

Hey Isto

Ihave some questions about your last chart. On  your chart you had some more Bearish dabrs earlier.... but you didnt react on them.... why? becos they are invalid?

Okey if they are invalid lets imagine situation that they are valid.... and they are triggered and then chart goes higher again.... this mean i will close my long position, open short... make a small loss... and than again open long but with small position becos 1 signal..... If this is true, than we will lose a huge amount of profit....

Well as promised (to isto) here is what I have found works for me:

I have found that working on the 15 minute and longer timeframes using ONLY AO and AC I am making far more consistent profits than I ever have using the system as a whole as detailed in Trading Chaos Second Edition.

I find that identifying the divergent bars is a very subjective thing i.e. is there an angle between the divergent bar and the Alligators teeth / jaw? Is there enough angulation? I'm never sure.

Anyway - according to the book - the AO is the best indicator around and, although it is NOT recommended by Bill and Justine Williams to use this indicator on its own, they also say that using this indicator correctly 'should be worth at least seven figures to you in the next few years'.

I think the reason for making the divergent bars the first entry point is to get you into the trend reversal early to maximize profits. My problem is that I don't really care whether the profits are maximized - just as long as I am making consistent profits - and this seems to be working nicely for me.

All I am doing is trading the Dow, S&P, Nasdaq, and DAX using AO and AC (the 15 minute charts seem to be the best for me because I am one of those traders that needs to be trading all day every day otherwise I don't feel like I have a job). Basically - I have the AO and AC open on my chart - and place a market order to buy the moment the new bar changes from red to green and place a market order to sell the moment the new bar changes from green to red. I hold on to the positions - no matter what - until the very first 'contradictory' bar changes color on the AC. That's it.

The trick to this is that on the shorter time frames I have found that both Metatrader and my other brokers' trading platform may present the wrong color AO and AC bars the instant that the new bar appears (I think it has to do with the immediate opening price). The way I get around this is I wait for the new bar to appear and then just hit 'refresh' a couple of time until I am sure that the bar is not going to change color and then, depending on the 'constant' color, I open my position (this is tied to a previous problem that I described where fractals 'disappear' i.e. the platforms draw the fractal BEFORE the second bar to the right of the fractal bar has closed and if the price then goes in the same direction of the fractal at any point while drawing the third bar the fractal disappears).

Also - I wait until there is a nice 'high' or 'low' saucer formed before opening a position i.e. sometimes the saucer (or oscillator) is just above or below the zero or middle line - I stay away from those. I know the height of the saucer or oscillator is purely dependent on price BUT the way I interpret things - the 'higher' or 'lower' the top of the saucer or oscillator - the greater the 'conviction' of the traders and the stronger the movement will be in the opposite direction.

My main problem with the entire system as detailed in the second edition of the book is the fact that EVERY SINGLE TIME a fractal signal is taken there is an immediate retractment. I contacted Justine Williams about this and she said to place your stop orders a little further away from the fractal to avoid the order getting 'falsely' executed but I started to find that no matter HOW far away from the fractal I placed an order it somehow ALWAYS got executed and then the price would retract. I tried everything - including placing a buy stop order below a fractal when the system was telling me that I should be placing a sell stop order etc. etc. but most times I was wrong and then lost money by getting stopped out. I also tried using fibo and pivot points - just to 'unsure' for me.

Anyway - look here:

Fintrans and could you tell percentage of  loss trades and profit trades... and ratio... System is interesting

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Gladly - except that I will only start doing it from the end of next week.

The reason being is that starting this week (Monday) I have drawn up a spreadsheet to make weekly targets for myself (the main reason being is that over the past couple of months I have messed up badly simply because I have held on to profitable positions that have invariably turned into losses simply because of greed and not knowing when to stop). My target basically from now on is 20% per week of my capital. If I hit that in an hour on Monday morning - I'm gone for the week. If I don't - as long as by Friday I have made my target - things are good. This idea FORCES me to take profit when a position reaches 20% of its cost (or to at least place a stop loss at that point assuming I am further into a profit situation).

Money management (in my opinion) is the 'make or break' of any system. Taking profit on trades (BEFORE they eventually turned into losses) and subtracting bad trades (those that never turned to a profit) for the past six months - I could be a wealthy man right now!!! I'm not - and this is the main reason. Food for thought!

You would be surprised at how compounding your profits builds up - just try it. Don't aim for that 'sparkling' trade - plod along - you'll do well.

Anyway - good trading!

Edit:

Oh - and by the way - using AO and AC as desribed above - make sure that AC is also 'high' or 'low' before opening a position. The reason I say this is because when it is hanging around the middle or zero line - there is no 'conviction' in the market - and you will find that this is where the brokers are just hanging around trying to catch stops (it just happened to me while I was typing this message - because - I was not concentrating)!!!

Second edit:

There is one other 'magic bullet' that I forgot to put in my first message.  I have Stochastics (14/3/3) open on my chart as well.  Although this is not pure Bill Williams it gives me a sense of 'comfort' i.e. I will only sell when Stochs are above 80, AO is green, and AC is red and only buy when stochs are below 20, AO is red, and AC is green.  I am experimenting with the idea of 'hedging' positions when I get valid AO and AC signals but Stochs are around the 50 line and flat.

Regards,

Dale.

Okey here todays chart of EESR

Till this moment i got 2 signals only

Bearish Dbar triggered and 3AO.  But now i doubt what to do!

We have 5 green bars... and i could close at 35.5.... or maybe i could wait little more.... and after short correction price will go higher....

My thoughts that price will go higher... becos there is no divergence in AO...

So my opinion i will put stop on 34.8 and wait.... of course i can get losses but Dbars are saying that down trend was broken.  I'd better wait for bearish Dbar....

So how do you guys see my situation

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Protei,

What about balance line signal . I hope that would be valid !

Should we buy as per balance line signal, if price crosses the top.

or since bearish dbar is stopped out, we should wait for fractal before getting a fresh entry.

I presume bullish dbar is invalid, bcoz it is above the alligator.

But logically , I feel it is  giving a signal in the direction of the main trend.

So it is slightly confusing, bcoz we are taking dbar signal against the trend and avoiding the signal in the direction of the trend.

pls give your view on the above points.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Key my point of view.

AO and AC are green for a long moment.... more than 8 ticks....

A think that trend will change soon... of course bulls are powerful... but the cannot hold the price... in any case put you stop  sell lower than Bearish Dbar... and put stop buy higher...

Concerning Balance signal.... after we closed our position... should we reopen our position with the same amout of lots or... only with 1?....

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi tej

neither of all.

Last two bars are showing that the market is balaned (drifting) at the moment and there must come some new info to push it in one or another direction.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
If you read reules again you'll see that one of them is:
"there must be acute angle between price and MAs" (I quote it by hart but you'll get the point)...

--- 帖子 #388 ---
A strong Bullish Divergent Bar Setup is forming during last two H4 sessions in GBPAUD.

More comments are available here

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Well guys i have a hard question... here on chart is an example, when it its really to follow trend... becos there are many Dbars.... and i dont know really how to solve it... this example from history... but it is actually for this moment..... becos if we take a Dbar then we start to go against trend at this moment...   And also maybe we could make some rules when to close position... becos sometimes there is no Dbars but trend changes...

So first chart is an example from the past and second is from this moment... i think they are quite the same... becos i closed the position... and dont know what to do now... So guys your suggestions... how go with trend and not to take a wrong side

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Each setup is just an opportunity. There is no way (or I don't know any) you can decide whether a signal is valid or not. This is what are the rules for...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Isto but if so then it is really hard to follow trend line when it is slightly going up or down... like on my examples....

Also another that i have checked is if you start your trade with Dbar you can always close it with Balance signal... of course if alligator on your side... if not then you should just wait.... maybe alligator will close or maybe 5 zone bars....  Well as i can see on my chart #2 there were 7 zone bars (AO and AC both up) and AO is green for 10 sessions allready... i think that is too much...

Anyway tomorow will be new information... and we might open again with Gap up higher than Up fractal now...

So i put stop buy higher than fractal up and actually i cannot put stop sell... becos down fractal far away... Okey lets see what will be tomorow

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi Protei,

Even I have noticed the following two problems,

(i) dbars may take us out of the main trend and we may lose a big move.

(ii) I have actually encountered the problem of market changing trend without forming a dbar.

I wish other members will also share their experience on this problem & probably what action they have taken to remedy this problem.

I am sure  isto can throw some light on this.

hi ,

I was just re-reading New Trading Dimensions :

In the chapter : Techniques for taking profits .

I came across these lines

"   THE BEST OVERALL STOP WHEN YOU KNOW YOU
ARE WITH THE TREND AND THE TREND IS NOT OVERWhen you have evidence that you are still in a trending market, your best overall stop is the Red line.  "

I feel dbar  method was introduced to deal with sideways market

Therefore using dbar method leads to early exit, when market is in strong Trend.

Can someone help me in identifying , when to use red line or dbar method ?

isto, what is your experience on this matter. I am sure you would have faced such situations & you might have found some answer also.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi isto,

Kindly tell me what should have been the right trades as per the chaos system in this chart.

As per my limited understanding of the system , I believe

i)   we should  go long on break of the fractal

ii)  Add on AO, AC, zone  & Balance line  signals

iii) Close all long positions on break of Bearish dbar.

iv) Create a fresh short position (1 lot) on break of Bearish dbar.

v) Close this short position, when price crosses top of the bearish dbar

vi) Open a long position (1 lot) as per balance line signal, when price crosses top of the bearish dbar

regards

Hello tej

Here is I think a classic sample of dbar (beginning is in post #388).

DBar has two major properties to qualify as DBar. it is far away from the red line there is acute angle between price and red line

There are valid and not valid DBars, visible on the chart below.

1st bunch of DBars (not valid) do not interrupt the trend and down move continue.

2nd DBar (valid) result into a sideway move (down trend is interupted at the moment).

Gerenaly speaking sideway is the place where trend might:continue previous move reverse So here DBar gives us just a signal that a reverse might happen.

There is no rule that DBar will cause trend reverse. It is a signal the trend might reverse in near future.

A Signal appearace does not mean that we must act immediately (place order).

A Signal appearace just says "be careful. an possible event in front."

That's all

And trader acts according the rules he/she follows and according the believes he/she has about the chart landscape.

Hope this will clear a little bit the matter

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Isto on your chart this invalid Dbars changed the trend for some moment.. and any way price many times closed higher than red line... so we should immidiately close our short positions, or we will begin to feed Alligator.... i think this is the main rule of Chaos trading

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Yes, but main down move is stil valid. Thevertheless these spikes above red line should close short positions

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hey isto and friends,

Just a comment - I don't think it's a long way off now when we see a bearish divergent bar formed on the daily AUD/USD chart.  It is becoming so obvious that even I can see it.  When it is formed there should be good angulation and this would be one of the trades where I would abandon my sole use of AO and AC and go with the system as a whole.

Anybody agree with me?  Any comments?

Regards,

Dale.

Just something else:  I placed a sell stop order based on a valid down fractal about two weeks ago on USD/CAD.  The order was hit and executed and ever since then it has been moving up and down and up and down - not enough to hit my stop loss and not enough to turn a profit.  This is one drawback of this system.  And to make matters worse I'm paying the swap on the thing every single day.  I mean - what are you supposed to do in this case?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hey isto: you're the expert!

What does it mean when you have divergence between AO and AC?

In other words - when AO is green and heading up and above the zero line and AC is red and heading down and below the zero line?

What's going to happen?

Regards,

Dale.

(Don't skip over my message just prior to this one though).

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi Dale, Thank you for your posting - it is an interesting point of view...

It will be interesting to see (if you don't mind) it in progress. I mean a open of a trade on a chart, progress and exit on other charts...

Don't you face too many whipsaws in this timeframe?

I personally cannot comment any suggestions for a futures move. Most of the time I'm wrong...

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I wish very much to be able to answer this question

If I knew I would screw down the market in few weeks

Well, back to the question:

AO = Momentum

AC = Acceleration

So when we have red AC and green AO this means that general tendency is price to go up while the speed of the move is slowing (the moving power has less steam to continue).

Red AC also means that slowing down acceleration is facing some strong resistance and if thie resistance is stronger than general move (AO) it could reverse the move and Acceleration will speed up in the opposite direction (down) trailing behing the Momentum

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hey isto - thanks for the input - I'll respond later.

For now - check out the chart for AUD/USD (and I hope it does not turn out like my last trade on USD/CAD - I eventually closed it out today for a $5.00 profit after a week! I made more in an hour on EUR/USD using AO and AC on their own than I did on that trade)!

Regards,

Dale.

Okey lets see how situation turns on EESR, and how i made a big mistake.

Becos of a good news prices opened with a little GAP (about 0.7%) higher than on the day before.  I looked a little on prices, found that price is going higher and happily went out for some business. But when i came back i was ashmed... becos i found a Bearish DBar on the top, and of course it was triggered. So i immidiately opened shorts... but i think it was too late....  When another Bullish DB was organised i closed Short positions with profit about 0.4% not big but its better than loss....

Anyway i missed this signal.... .

When will go price now i dont know.... becos we have a high support on 35.... and as it can be seen from the chart we tested it but didnt hit it.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
And another chart of SNGS... here also interesting situation

Here we dont have a DB on the top, but price began to lower..... but after 9 ticks... AC changed to green, and was Bullish DB was formed and the triggered... so i have 1 long position now. But i have so doubts what to do... becos last bar look like a bearish DB... so this mean market dont know wich way to choose... so i tightened my stops... hope we wont go down!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
From post #404

From my observations meny times price re-test Balance line. There are two points I see - Balance line as a resistance and trend line you've drawed as a support...

After one of them is taken well be clear (probablly) which will be the direction...

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi isto,

Thnx for giving detailed explanation about dbars.

I feel it will help many traders.

Above lines will help traders to formulate a strategy to deal with dbar failures, depending upon their beliefs.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi isto,

I would like to know ,  as to how you deal with situations given below :

For eg :

You are long  multiple contracts as per the system.

You find a valid bearish dbar.

Markets breaks  the low of the bearish  dbar.

What would you do ?

a) Close your long position and go short one contract

b) Close your long position and wait for next signal before shorting

c) Close your long position (Partially) and wait for red line signal for final exit.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hey Isto.. here is another chart of SNGS.... as you can see today we had a gap down about 1%.... but after we draw a Bullish Dbar.. that was triggered and price slightly began to growth.... but on the last hour price made a top and then immidiately went down... and closed on 30.300...  ACtually i dont know what to do... becos i have some lots of SNGS and  i think this is Bearish Dbar... but not valid... so your suggestions... where should i put stops?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Tej

I also have this question.... becos if i add multiple, then middle price of all lots go higher and higher... and usually it is closer to Dbar than i want it to be

I think after Dbar triggered we should close position... but also we should check AC and AO.. how are they... if they are both green, then i will wait... if they are green for a long time... i suggest close all positions... and open short on next signal.... if they are different colors... then open short.... i think thats it

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi tej

It is almost impossible to answer such a hypothetical question.

It depends on lots of signals, pair, market, etc...

--- 帖子 #411 ---
It seems a sideway move, especially the right side of the chart...

I would stay away...

--- 帖子 #412 ---
EURJPY formed two Bullish Divergent Bars during European session.

It failed twice to break down. Momentum and Acceleration are up. There are acute angle with Alligator's line.

So we have respectful signals for up move... Let's see

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Looks really dangerous Isto... so big candals....

Also Isto i have a question. How many lots do you buy on a 1 signal? 1?

Becos my exp. is saying that usually from 1 brake of DB and till 3AO we will have approximately 1-2% of move...  i think its too much... so maybe better to buy 2-3 lots on 1 break and then buy not 5 but 3-4?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
One - more that one is too dangerous expecially in DBars. Reverse might easily fail ...

--- 帖子 #415 ---
so another question is... if price is going up but still lower than red line... should we take other signals like balance line 3AC or others like AO crossing through zero or maybe zone signal? or only 3AO?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Protei,

I would buy one lot on Dbar Signal

bcoz like isto says :

So it is not really a reversal signal.... but a probability

& on my charts I have seen many dbars signals being stopped out...

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi isto,

Did u buy on the breakout of 1st bullish dbar.... ?

bcoz if you bought then you would have been stopped out...

Somehow i feel you might have skipped that signal..., probably bcoz mkt opened gap up and then came down.

what was the right action to be taken ?

Buy on 1st dbar.... stopped out & now try on 2nd dbar again

Or

Skip 1st dbar...bcoz of gap, & try for 2nd dbar

what is your suggestion

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi isto,

I have faced such situation many times

Pls Look at the chart, I have marked Fractal buy followed by other signals :

z -- Zone, bl -- Balance Line, AC & AO

Even if one buys one lot on each signal , there will be 12 lots

before 1st dbar appears.

So what should one do at this juncture.

a) Exit partial Long position

b) Exit full Long position

c) Exit full Long position & go short

If one had gone short he would have been stopped out.

[ This is another question where to place the stop loss trigger.

a) Above the bullish bar or b) Above the 1st dbar ]

What should we do , after we take a dbar signal and are stopped out ?

a) Should we just exit our position

b) reverse the trade in main direction, bcoz if dbar trade was stopped out, it means that original trend is still on (as in this case)

Now we are getting one more bearish dbar...

So as per system we should go short again ?

Pls answer it in detail.... it will help to clear the confusion in my mind.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi protei,

I have read two main axioms of the market

i) Trend is Your Friend

ii) When in Doubt, Stay out.

Like Isto says there is no trend, we should probably stay out.

But I have seen that, big Trending moves, usually start from a sideways market.

Since you are already long, You could hold the position with the same stop loss. Bcoz, you are getting 3 AO signal also,

& moreover when you went long , u were prepared for stop loss of dbar.

And despite all this if market wants to go down , You will get your exit and 1st entry signal on break of down fractal.

By this time It would have broken the up trend line also. Thus a double confirmation to go short.

This is just my view, it may be wrong completely...

Pls remember I am trying to learn .....

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thanks Tej  for your awnser....

And on your chart i see that you should tighten your stops, becos last Bearish Dbar have acute angel... and also AC and AO for a long time were green.... and now AC turned to red... so be careful!

Concerning DBars... i think if Dbar is triggered you should put stop there.... becos market can reverse also on a 1 Dbar... But here could be 1 exception... if AO and AC are green... then you might wait a little with stop for Dbar.. and look for next bar.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I avoid signals inside Alligator. When price is inside this means that for the moment there is a balance between sellers and buyers.

This means that there is no direction defined - so I'm staying out.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi tej

I'm using stop orders pleaced according to the chart landscape - sometimes closer to the bar sometimes not so close...

If stop order is hit - it is executed automatically

Where there are great volatility or price is too close to Alligator I might miss 1st dbar or fractal

--- 帖子 #423 ---
On this very chart dbars does not seems to me a good place to reverse...

Neither are far away from the Alligator, nor there is anacute angel

I prefer to exit when stop loss is hit - unless there are striking divergence between price move and order direction.

When I hesitate I tight the stops.

If there are signals in opposite directions I place orders accordingly or stay out.

That's it

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Golden Rule - must be followed all the time!

Correct, but if it is a trend it will be lots of opportunity to enter.

It doesn't matter whether one or more signals are missed.

It is important to exit with profit.

Might be small one, but even $1 is better than any loss

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Here is a nice bullish setup on a daily chart

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Here is how EURJPY Bullish Divergent Bar develops so far (from post #412).

Currently price has touched support/resistance line.
Acceleration has turned up

Looking for the next move

trade is on a free teritorry

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Isto on that chart have you opened any long or short positions?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Another nice setup is described here

--- 帖子 #429 ---
long by DB

--- 帖子 #430 ---
So i continue with SNGS

Today it went lower and lower.. and finally broken line of support.... This is really bad... becos i had stops on 30... but broker called me and said that there is no need in stops becos support 29.9 wouldnt ever be broken. So he removed stops.... and at this moment i have about -2%  This is really bad.... otherwise i had only -1% if only i had had stops...

So your suggestion Isto for this chart.... should i go short?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Here is another golden rule:

Never Ever trade without stops set!

Of course he will! His comission grows while your account melts down

Ask him next time how he did know that - it is interesting to understand which "predict the future" pills he takes... (to make use of them )

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Just for the moment it seems you've missed short entry and there is no fresh signal for additional entry.

Price is between support (Double Bottom) and resistance (retrace level).

So I would wait for next signal or will move to another place...

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Actually i was asking him this question for a long time... Ehh... he usually smile on me.... when i was using Williams system.. with its buying when price go higher.... of course sometimes i make mistakes.... but usually they dont lead to such a terrible loss! i was planing to close positions on SNGS at 30...

Well this is a lesson for me... anyway i will phone him tomorow and ask What does he think about SNGS" Becos he promised that SNGS never go lower than 29.9  So maybe i went on this experiment only to show that he is nothing on market....

Okey, anyway your suggestions Isto.... how would you trade this SNGS chart... where would you open shorts...  If it is possible please write  will be very interesting and also will give me experience

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Isto but your suggestion where would you have opened short if you were me.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Well it is too easy to mark correct entry when you see the whole picture and price has developped already the pattern.

Anyway I don't know how I would trade this but from current price level and past moves I've marked the action on the chart...

The starting point is a Bearish Divergent Bar . ...

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Isto, Thanks alot!

But could you explain your Entrys...  and what is purple stoploss and what is black stoploss and what they mean

Entry1 : Dbar triggered... but as i can see you will buy not on the bar when it was triggered but on the next bar....

Entry2: What of signal is it?

Entry3: Fractal and 3AC signal

Entry4: Also dont understand

And Exit becos of purple line right?

And also 1 question... why you think that there was a Bearish Dbar... i though BDbar should close in the bottom half... but this one closed in the upper half... or maybe i missunderstand smth

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Well 1st entry (on the left) is DBar and (again on left) stop loss is hit (loss)

Entries on the right:

2nd entry - re-enter again because there is no other stronger signal(s)

3rd entry - 3AC signal - adding order

4th entry - AO zero line cross down - adding order

end finally - after gap fills - exit

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Erm, and this is bills signal if gap fills? or where can i read about it

--- 帖子 #439 ---
And also on Entry4 Ao didnt crossed zero line.... only AC crossed....

--- 帖子 #440 ---
no it's not Bill's, but it is too big reverst to stay any more in.

As for zero corss - both oscilators corss one ofter another...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Isto another question... how do you identify is there any trend or not.... actually the question is how can i understand it using Gator indicator?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
As for zero corss - both oscilators corss one ofter another...

Well actually AO began only turned to red... but not crossed the zero line... or maybe you are talking about zone signal?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
up trend = price > yellow > red > blue lines

down trend = price < yellow < red < blue lines

here is the explanation abount gathor

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks for explanation Isto

Hi isto,

I am waiting for your answer in the above case.

What should we do after dbar signal.

Can we take other signals like AC, AO, balance line , zone

before 3AO signal ?

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Isto you see problem of our market is gaps.... we look on DJIA S&P... we look on European indexes... we look on price of Oil and then we begin to trade.... and if something is going down we open with down gap... And today Everything seems went down...  so i think tomorow again will be gap...  and i can do nothing.... and gap probably will be about 3%....   anyway after market will open  i will close all long positions.. no matter what price will be... just to make my brain clear.... becos i am really feeding alligator

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Tej as Isto wrote on my chart... we might accept other signals

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Sorry, I've thought I did...

Anyway - I'm careful about DBars because this is a possible reversal point...

But yes - I take each signal and consider it - even old (Bill does not recommend this)

As I said before I dare to take decisions a little aside from the system - if I found a strong reason for...

there is a sample below ...

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Well the news is moving price up and down and there is news almost every hour...

For one or another extend each news influence on the market... Some days there are more news that combined have stonger effect.

So price have to be watched and trader must react to the market as market react to news.

There is no guarantie that if price has moved one direction, will continue, neither that will reverse...

Sometimes markets reverse and few bars later reverse again...

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Thanks isto,

bcoz i was under the impression that we should take other signals like AO,AC balance line etc only after first fractal has been taken out.

But it seems if dbar has been formed, then we can take other signals before fractal is formed.

Pls correct me, if i am wrong !

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Bill descriptions is when we take DBar, next signal is 3AO (quote is not exact...) - nothing in between.

Everyone decides for his own whether to take or not other signals.

I, miself decided to take them and up to now seems to be more profitable than lossing, but this might change in the future or other trader might face more losses than profit...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi isto,

I have seen that you like to take all the signals,

I am getting a feeling that you have devised some better exits strategies

which give you early exits in case market doesnot move in your favour.

May be you could share these Exit methods with us ...

tej

I'm sorry I have to disappoint you - there is nothing special - I just look at the charts each 4 hours (I use H4 and D1) and act accordingly to the picture I see.

Here is some statistics from today confirming the above:

win % 55

loss % 53

2 % are zero (neither profir nor loss)

Average profit per trade $ 491

Average loss per trade   $ 260

sicret? if any it is - if I doubt - I get out.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hmm really interesting.. so then i will also try to use old signals... becos usually after we break through the level of support (for short) there might be no signal at this moment but of course if we go through this level we should add some lots. Price for 100% will go lower...

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Isto, I been reading and following this system for over 2 years now. And i have read all books from bill williams, and seen all sort of EA's and tried to follow the system on all timeframes, but quiet honestly this system does not work well on Forex. even bill and his daughter suggest not using time frames bigger than 15min on the forex market, since the forex market is so volatile, this type of trend following system does not work well.

It works wonders in markets that hold trend for longer periods, but what system does not work in those market conditions anyway.

Sorry to disappoint you but I gave up on this system and never looking back. Good luck to you though

--- 帖子 #459 ---
killerKhan

I think this system works everywhere.... but you shouldnt accept all signals... so this is the main thing to follow.... If you follow the system step by step of course you wount get profit, becos market is changing... but if you get only few signals after analys of AO and AC.... then you might success.

This is my opinion of course

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hello KillerKhan, yes - trade could be very disappointed. And you're right - forex is not like to other markets - moving power is much different that in any other market one could trade. yes - forex is much volatile and unpredictable than other markets. yes - this system is devoted to long trend markets. as for timeframe - in forex 15 min (in my point of view) is too small because of the meny whipsaws caused by this very volatility.

To trade in a time frame less than 1 hour one must be very quick and very concentrated all the time to be able to get out some profit.

I also though that smaller time frames will be more profitable (because I had lack of patience ) and I used to trade all time frames even tick-by-tick one.

Many times I have been broken,

meny times I gave up.

And many times before to close and never looking back I've made analysis of my action because I was curious whether I'm so stupid that a market could beet me every time.

And every time I was amazed how many mistakes I've made...

These mistakes made me go back...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well I do not intend to persuade anyone to do anything.

I'd like just to say that there is not the system that makes profit,

neither fancy EA or software,

it is the trader's mind and it trader does not have deep acquaintance of the market and moving forces behind there is no system that might help.

Sorry for the long post. I wrote it because I know there are many many disapointed traders feeling really bad from some software, systems, market, or something ...

This is just an attempt to push them to think and analyze themselves and their actions on the market.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Well to avoid some mistakes or misunderstanding I'd like to underline.

Each signal, old or new, must be analyzed by itself in context of the pair and current conditions.

Signals cannot be traded mechanically (nevertheless how strong I wish this).

and a signal does not lead to an order.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thanks Isto for the explanation!

So here how the trade turns... looks very interesting and of course maybe we have a nice place for a long position?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
And also chart of EESR... on the break of Bullish DB i bought 1 lots... AC is going up!

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I think the market will retest the level just taken and if a long position is opened you've to be prepared to close it fast

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Here is a sample of an old signal I've taken...

--- 帖子 #466 ---
The only signal the I know works 100% from this system is the first signal. Which is the counter trend trade, they call is wiseman1, I call it the rubber band effect.

Looking at eurusd right now, the price has left the alligator in 1 swift move down, and if you imagine a rubber band around the alligator and the price, the move your stretch the rubber the more chances or the rubbe band snapping back. In other words if price goes up in 1 big swift move I usually wait for the next candle and I sell, for a small profit, my target is usually the alligator for exit. same if the price moves down in 1 swift move, I buy at next candle and exit when price reaches alligator again.

This is the only signal that works all the time in forex and it works in any time frame. All other signals are trend following signals.

just my 2 pips.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hey Isto! I think you should have a look on it! It was amazing... but today SNGS did +2.5%

Look on chart... actually i had 2 more entrys... Anyway i didnt closed my long position.. and added to it 3 more lots...

My explanation... on the bottom we have a Bearish Dbar... another thing is that we have double bottom... Anyway by Williams system i should add 1 lot on 1 signal and 5 bar on 2 signal.. but i add only 2 lots on second signal becos i was in 2 minds....

And now price is very nice and it seems that we dont have a DB and we might have a trend.... i hope so....

--- 帖子 #468 ---
And with ESR i have a problem... i dont know where should i put stop loss?

I had 3 entrys: 1 DB, 2 3AC, and the third still not triggered.

Okey anyway AC now is going down.... price is near 35.4-35.5.... i put my stop on 35.3 but, if stop hits i will lose money... Becos i have 5 lots... 1 from 35.15 and 3 others from 35.5.... So your suggestions....

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi isto,

I always had this question in mind....

When we enter as per DB our Stop Loss is other end of DB (No problem so far)

But When we enter on 3AO etc after DB signal has ben taken, where should we put our stop loss. because Keeping the stoploss on other side of DB would be too far.

What is you suggestion ...... ?

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi Protei,

Nice DB, confirmed with Double Bottom.... Gave you good up move

This tells us one more thing... If DB is confirmed by any other indicator , then chances of success are high & in such cases we should probably add more aggressively.

I was wondering why you did not use Zone Signals for addition !

( I know it is easier for me to say , bcoz I can see the past on the chart )

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Aha Tej.... on EESR you can see what will be if i use zone signals.... on SNGS it would work but on EESR....

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Tej your question is right (about stops)! this is i a big problem... becos if we have 1 lot from Dbar it's not a problem... but if we trigger next signal like 3AO we have 6 lots.... and this is a big problem if price goes lower than DB... we will have a mega loss...

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Stops seem reasonable there.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Depends... (always depends )

I usually place stops on the other side of the current or previous bar...

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Look at this situation.... Really funny i was kick by stop losses.... and market closed -4%

Anyway one question... with this Dbar... i cannot trade by trend... i always trying to find em... and after 1 tick closing my positions... i dont know what to do... if market went up and then triggered bearish DB and after short moving down stopped near alligator... what should i do next... wait until we find a direction?

And also on SNGS on top we have a DB or not? i cant figure it out

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Well Protei, You have to bear in mind that not each Bbar is a valid one.

Two main conditions have to be met so as to qualify a bar as DBar: In a strong trend to have price moved far away from Alligator's line to have acutre angel with Alligator's line

on the chart of the post above you have neither of these...

Acctually I see a ranging stock raghly between 29 - 31 levels. Look how many bars you have in there - almost whole chart...

This is why once hit DBar reverse and hit stoploss.

It is wrong to trade trend system on a range market!

Here is the H4 chart of EURCAD traded last few sessions and closed today.

there were two 1 lot orders and one 2 lots.

Total profin from this trade is more than $5000

--- 帖子 #479 ---
EURNZD trade also ended.

There were two excellent entry points on 3 green Momentum bars and Balance line where price hesitated for a while ....

The rest was a big rally

--- 帖子 #480 ---
For ONCE - I was right!!!

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Yes this was a nice DBar. I'd like to show the next signal - 3 consecutive red AO bars...

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hmm anyway i am doing something wrong....

Look at this chart... we have a DB on the bottom... and then it was triggered... so i got a long position... but the price after a short up movement went down.... is there anything wrong with me?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Here is example of invalid Dbar... or valid? becos we have 2 Dbars.... First is valid and second is invalid... wich should i choose.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Isto pls tell me becos this chart now looks

--- 帖子 #485 ---
What do you like to tell you?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
was this bar invalid or not? becos price now is 272.... and going higher... i see here double bottom.. but second DB is invalid... first one is valid... what should i do?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
What I see on this chart is that price broke the Bearish Fractal but failed to continue.

This break was not supported neither by Momentum nor by Acceleration

Obviously the move is up.

On the next session, if direction is the same you'll probably have 3 green AO bars... and the next test will be Bullish fractal...

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Okey here is another picture...

You said next test.... what does it mean.. where do you see bullish DB

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Here on chart will be more clear I hope ...

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Isto damn.... i wrote lines not as you did... now i see that this was a valid bullish Dbar...

But why will you go long only after 3AO signal and not after triggering DB?

And also where will you open short position?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
And here is SNGS... I think picture is quite the same as previous.

I had 1 entry after triggering DB and second entry after fractal signal but then price went down and hit my stop loss.. any way i  got a small profit....

Isto how will you trade this chart?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Isto Did i get it right... you enter only after 3AO signal and not after Dbar is triggered?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Isto on your post
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=478

i can see that price hit stop loss... but why did you put your stop loss there... you were in a long position.. and put your stop loss on the top of DB... or at that moment you were allready in a short position becos price hit DB in the bottom?

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Here is one of the possible entries.

I'd like to mention that short is more dangerous because price could fail taking the bottom...

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Isto could you explain why should we go short from this position?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Because if price fails to take Bullish Fractal (less probable) it will test the last Bearish Fractal.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Because the volatility was too high.  Because Bears 3 times pushed down the Bulls.  Because the angle was too steep. Surely you could mention some more reasons.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I see a Bullish Divergent bar, 3 green AO and Bulish fractal.

So a possible tactic if you're long after DBar could be: next entry is 2 lots (AO and Bulish fractal signal) above the resistance...

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi Isto,

Pls look at the chart and tell whether the DB is valid ?

It looks valid to me bcoz :

a) It is away from alligator

b) steep fall

c) Acute angle

I went long above this Bullish DB, with my stop loss at low of S2,

Now after the next bar , which is Bearish DB, Should I move my stop to low of  S1 ?

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Well tej, my recomendations will be:

1) Tighten your stop loss...and put it on the top of S2...

2) Add 1 more lot if price go lower than S1...

Hey guys you are lucky... becos on my charts i dont see any trend.... prices are just jumping up and down always crossing alligator.... How can i trade on this chart... i wonder....

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi Protei,

I already closed my short and went long above the top of S2

with stop below the low of S2.

So What Should I do,

If price moves below low of S1.... Close my Long and go short ?

or Wait till price breaks the Low of S2 before going short.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I think you should go short if price go lower S2....

I wish We had trends.....

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Thechnically - yes - the listed requirements are met.

Logically - no because it you take a look over the Alligator you'll certainly will notice that Alligator's lined are intertweaned.

This is why this could be either a good DBar or a signa of a new down move...

But this dualistic view exists always

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi tej

I'd like to strongly underline that it is very dangerous to trade on somebody else recommendations.

Nobody could protect you from mistakes and every trader makes mistakes. The question is how does trader react to mistakes and to market signals in general.

This convinience of one or another action comes with practice and this is what evry trader must do all the time (nevertheless how successful is) analyse act analyse analyse act analyse ...

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Isto i doubt how to trade on such a market.... look on the chart... i bought  when price was 29.3 and sell by stop loss on 28.7 after what price immidiately returned on 29.2..... nice trade

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Isto maybe i put my stops too close? or maybe too far?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I personally avoid trading charts having fractals on both side of the alligator. Especially if there are few of them.

Ehat I see are ranges, break down, reande, break down, range...

If you want to trade this very chart you should try other tactics - there is no trend - you've $2 from 12 to 30 July - this cannot be labeled as "trend"...

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Maybe you are right.... still there is no trend

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Continuing from the previous post:

Here is a nice sample for several different stages: We have range on the left We have strong rally (trend) We have Bearish Dbar

DBar is supported by strong down acceleration and more than 6 green AO bars...

Here is a nice opportunity to try short side (keeping in mind that move might reverse sharply again)

Let's see what will be

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi Isto,

Thanks for pointing out that Traders have to live with dilemma always.

I feel an Objective System removes most of the Dual conditions.

But Yes ! we will still have these duality problems.. If there were no dual conditions then there will be no market. All markets Exist bcoz two people look at it from opposite point of view.

I have attached the latest chart showing how the market unfolded...

a) I closed my short position & went Long above the Top of DB1 bar.

b) After DB2 & DB3 bars were formed, I closed my long position below low of DB2 and went short again.

c) Now there is DB4 again, I am planning to close my short positions & go long above DB4.

I would like to know , if my actions were correct or wrong. So that

I can improve from next time...

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi tej

if BD2 & DB3 are bearish dbars must be ignored at all. DBar is bar that goes against the trend. So Bearish DBars in a down move do not make sense ...

As to DB4 - it appears just after Alligator opens its mouth so

though it is possible, for me it seems more probable to go in down direction than to revers so soon (but it could!)

More probable for me is re-taking the bearish fractal which is very nice place to enter short with small risk.

As always you must be ready to act according with the market...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Tej, i think market simply dont know where he should go. Bears and Bulls are powerfull here... and so noone won today.... but maybe tomorow.... i think this is somekind of a range market... where Williams dont work.... you will only lose your money, like i do

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Isto here is an example chart.... do i have a trend here or not? Alligator is opened.... on the bottom we have many Bullish Dbars and price failed to take 2000 level

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I thought a little and found nice solution for my situation... What do you think if i trade using 5 minute time frame?

Look on the chart of SNGS with 5 minute time frame.

I think it looks greate! i see here micro trends... that might give me some profit... Isto what do you think about it?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hi isto,

Thank you for reminding me that we should consider only those dbars which go against trend. I have removed DB labels from these bars.

After looking at your drawing of Angulation, I realised i will need some good practice before I can draw the angle in right way.

Your analysis : seems more accurate & makes sense.

But I had already gone long before reading your reply. bcoz I thought that other than DB we had some sort of confirmation from AC bars, that probably down trend is slowing down.

Now, the market has moved in my favour & I am getting 3AO signal (2nd Wiseman) & as per the system we should add 5 contracts at this signal. Only Doubt I am having is that this signal is coming right at the mouth of the alligator. At one side I have the axiom : Do not feed the alligator!, at other side this 3AO signal.

& also there is another bullish fractal nearby( but it is below Red Line), because of this dilemma I am planning to buy only one contract , if market takes out the bullish fractal.

Stop loss for this Entry. (3AO + bullish Fractal) would be low of previous bar.

Pls give your analysis.....

regards

tej

Tej i think market soon will go down again.... i saw such patterns many time....after 50% up correction price went down.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi Protei,

I have been thinking about this from quite sometime.

In the book : New Trading Dimensions. Williams Says :

These two sentences tell us what to expect,

Since we are following a trend following System. It will make money only 15 to 30% of the time (i.e. when the market is in Trend)

Now, this seems a very pessimistic statement. But Truth is always hard to digest.

So we could do two things....

i) Keep searching the markets and trade only those markets which giving us clear trend

ii) Or may be drop down to lower time frames & take a trade when we see a clear cut trend in lower time frame. { If mkt is sideways in daily time frame, we could drop down to hourly, If hrly is also sideways then maybe 30 min, 15 min or even 5 min) But the problem with lower time frames is, we will have to be very quick and profits will be smaller.

regards

tej

P.S :

{ My mkt was giving me hard time in daily time frame, So I dropped down to hrly time frame, After 1st good move, now it is giving me continuous whipsaws   }

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Tej.... thats why i decided to trade on 5 minutes.... Of course you wount have enough time to look on other charts... but anyway you have shoulders.. and you can trade using them to maximize your profit. I think using short time frames is usefull on stocks but not on Currency. So as i can see Isto's diagrams price is moving rapidly there.... but on my stocks price is not so fast and i can spend a week doing nothing..... well i dont want sit and wait.... so i'll try to...  i hope i will have a chance....

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Do not trade by my or anybody else advise!

Sooner or later this will crash your account.

All comments are only to clear the system and how to apply it on the chart(s).

This is not a buy/sell signals service

I don't see any change in the picture.

Price is in a range. This might be pumping steam for the next move...

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi isto,

I fully agree with your comment :

As I had mentioned earlier also , That my main focus is on learning the finer points of the system. ( Hopefully my queries will benefit other members also. )

I am fully aware that I am a newbie.... thats the reason I am trading only in demo account. So that I don't lose Real Money and still get the real life experience. I feel Trading in the live market gives better experience than looking at the charts after the pattern has completed. After Market has completed its move, It is easy to say what should have been the Correct startegy. Thats the reason I thought I will take your guidance to find out, if I am correct or wrong. { Your comments have always been precise & have helped me to clear my doubts }.

Since I found a valid DB in the maket, I thought I will try to trade this move completely (in my Demo Account ). So that I can Learn under your guidance as the market progresses.

Given below are the steps I took in response to the information provided by the market :

a) Go Long above the High of DB2 ( 1st Wise man)

b) Add position as per the 3AO signal (2nd Wise man)

c) Closed all the open Long positions & Went Short as per the Balance Line Signal

d) Closed Short Position & Went Long above the Fractal

e) Add one more contract on open of the last bar, as per Zone Signal

f) Add one more contract above the high of the previous bar as per AC Signal

g) Next Zone Signal contract to be added on open of Next bar

If you don't mind , pls evaluate all the steps taken and guide me where ever I was Wrong !

Hi isto,

Today the market opened with a huge down gap !

My , Long entry  proved to be really dangerous.

Is  there any Rule as per the system which could have prevented me from taking Long position ?

Such huge gap down openings, when you are long multiple contracts , can really crash the account.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Tej, What time frame are you trading? check the higher TF and see where market is going, b4 you jump into trades

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi tej

No, there is not.

The only thing I could add is that trading a DBar requires (by common sense) tight stops because move is against the trend and there is higher probability the move in this new direction to fail.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Here are  results from yesterday setups in EURAUD (post #522) and AUDCHF (post #523)

--- 帖子 #528 ---
My 5 cents... all this time i was trying to find new tactics using Williams signal... and here what i have found.

Well first of all we see Dbar.... If this bar is triggered we might close our current possition....  then we are waiting for 3AO signal... It will be 3 bars and one of them will be the highest... so if Price triggers maximum of this bars, we will go in long position with all money we have (if previous move was down).... and stop we will put lower than Dbar... this entry will allow us maximize our profit... becos after triggering 3AO signal the chance that trend changes is 80-90%.... this is a good perecent...

So your ideas... i tested this tactic and it gaved me profit...

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Good for you!

Any system, book, tool or whatsoever has a main purpose - to help user understand the market.

When we really understand what's happened in there the result is profit

Okey i will test it more....  need more time to get statistics...

Hi isto,

I normally have a problem while drawing angle for DB.

Most of the time I am able to draw acute angle as well as parallel lines on the same figure.

I feel I am doing something wrong.... I need your help in finding the correct starting point to draw angle.

I have attached a chart with multiple  DB's

I have labelled two DB's Where I am able to draw acute as well as parallel lines

Pls  draw angle for  these dbars.

My main confusion is where should be the starting point,

a) Should we start from the place where the bars cut the Red Line ?

or

b) Should we start from the nearest pivot ?

Pls guide me....

Hi Protei,

I hope you have seen my earlier posts #515 , #520 and #524

If you are entering on 3AO & stop loss at low of DB, I believe your stop loss would be huge...

tej

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi dinka,

Mostly I trade on Hourly time frame...

But as far as I know..... Alligator helps me to filter out the trade against the trend. Thus by using this system one will automatically  trade only in the direction of main trend.

Isto would be the right person to tell you if i am right or wrong.

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hi tej

starting point is the where price is nearest to the lines. Then draw lin on high/low of the bar and you'll get the angle.

I have to mention that angle evaluation is quite subjective... (as the other stuff)

also correct angle does not guarantee reversal.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
these are also acceptable.

interpretation is yours

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi isto,

I was just re-reading the book New Trading Dimensions.

In the book, under the topic Alligator behaviour it is mentioned :

But whenever we take DB or 3AO signals they are generally against the trend. In short we are trying to predict the end of the trend. Could this be the reason for many DB/3AO failures ?

If you will relook at my earlier post #520 & #524 , you will notice that my long position based on 3AO/Fractal/zone etc  gave me a big loss. And now I am thinking, it was because I broke the above rule, I went Long when the trend was down.

This line also tell us that we should not take signals , when the price is going towards the jaw. Thus by going long in downtrend or going short in Uptrend we are breaking these main rules & taking a bigger risk....

What is your opinion ?

tej

this a reply to post #537

Well, this system is not perfect one. It (as any other system) generate losses.

Here the most importent becomes trader decisions and trader overview about current state of the market...

As for the rules, you might motice that system from New Trading Dimentions is altered a lot in Trading Chaos 2nd edition...

Usual explanation is that on time the system has been created, trends have been longer than nowadays. These longer trends are replaced with choppy markets and higher volotility.

Perhaps this is why DBar has been announced...

When I've started trading this system, I've used it as a Holy Grail, i.e. signal = order.

Now, I believe that this is more an attempt to explain how (and why) market behaves.

When one knows what and why is happening, exact rules are no more necessary.

It doesn't matter whether order will be opened 1 or 10 tick(s) above the break, because trader's goal is to catch the big move...

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Well tej i agree that stop loss might be big... but anyway.... as i allready said the chance that trend will change is about 80%.... yes of course there will be 2 chances to lose money... but also we will have 8 chances to earn... so i think this is a good chance.... And btw... no matter what kind of system is and where the stop loss is placed... The main point is that system must have chances to win more than chances to lose

Okey anyway yesterday i lost about 0.5%... lets see what will be today

Okey on Friday i had about 1.2%... thats nice.... isnt it?

Hi Protei,

Thats Really great..... { See the effect of Compunding }

If you can make only 1% everyday

you will be able to Double you capital in 3 months &

By the Year end,  your capital should be 20 times...

Hi isto,

Is there any significance of Divergence between Price & AO

or Price & AC

Can we use such divergence to enhance our trading.... ?

I have attached a chart showing divergence....

Pls Give your opinion...

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Thanks Tej, i am glad to hear that

Yesterday and today i've made about 5%!

Now i can write my system here.... look on the chart...

Today i had 1 long position and 2 short positions.

In the morning after price failed to break level 28.578 i opened long position with target 28.81 and it was triggered after 1 hour..... then after the price got to level 29... i found that we have 3AO red bars. SO i immidiately put my stop sell lower than this signal was... actually i put it on 28.81 (again this level eeh) and after few seconds it was triggered and my target was 28.67 and price hit it after 10  minutes... so i was really happy  after this 2 trades i had about 1.8%... and the last one... and the worst one

I knew that movement down is slowing and soon it will grow... any way i opened short position on 28.399... and put my target on 28.25.... can you imagine... but price hit only 28.251!!!! only 1 more point... and after it growth higher... and hit my stop loss on 28.46.... any way today i have about 1.4% of profit! not bad

And concerning my system... yes now i use money management... and my target is about 0.7-1% from 1 trade. Of course i dont get all movement... like it could be seen on the chart... but i think 1 percent per day will be enough...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Also i'd like to admit that entering by 3AO signal is the best way to earn some money  works in 90% situations with me!

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi,

Does anybody know what are the new rules for this system in the second Edition of "Trading Chaos"?

I wanted also to ask you if in the new version there is a better filtering of the trades, because I get a lot of false signals.

And also, I don't know really when to exit a trade, when I'm in profit and also when I'm losing. When I'm in a losing trade, price will often cross the red line and then again rebound in the same direction, so is there a better signal to use?

I've also a problem trading the fifth dimension. What is that balance line drawn on the chart? Is it the teeth's line? If yes, then it should never happen that we are long below the line. I've looked in the book and on Alpari's website, but I was not able to find any information about that line.

Another question. If we have closed an order on a stoploss triggered after five bars af same color or we exited after a divergence bar, can we take the signals on the Awesome oscillator or Acceleration oscillator if we are still outside the mouth or do we have to wait for a new fractal first?

How should be the alligator when we enter? If the lines are intertwined, we should not take a fractal, but that's often at that time that a big move is coming and just after the fractal the 3 lines are diverging as required.

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi protei,

I was trying to understand your method,

I believe you enter once you get 3AO signal...

Can you tell me, how do you calculate your stop loss & target

regards

tej

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Well stop loss usually lower than Dbar... and target... well it depends on type of stock.... usually about 0.7%-1%

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi isto,

I would like to better understand the new rules for trading chaos. Is the 5 SMA a new exit signal from Bill Williams?

Could you please explain me how you enter? Do we have to wait gor a green-green signal on the Gator indicator before taking a fractal? How should be the Alligator lines? The problem is that often the mouths opens right after the fractal was hit and we missed the entry.

Is there a better filter for entry? I also noticed that you initially set a stoploss below the last down fractal if you enter long and reverse for short entry. Is there a filter on how to know if we have to exit when the prices crosses and closses on the other side of the red line or if we have to wait for the fractal in the other direction to be triggered?

It often happens to me that the price crosses the fractal signal, goes 1 or 2 pips high and the the price is going in the other direction. Is there something I'mdoing wrong when I enter?

Have you seen the USDCHF chart on the 30m, 1h our 4h timeframe? It is full of bad signals. How do you do to avoid big losses like in this case?

Thank you very in advance for your help!

Cheers,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi,

Have some of you tried to modify the way to exit when a fractal breakout is not working so good?

I think the idea of the breakout is really good. Bill Williams wrote that, if we are not in the market, it is better to wait for the alligator to sleep and place a stop order for both last valid up and last valid down fractal.

I think that if a fractal breakout occurs and this breakout is a valid one, the the price should have a strong move and it should not go back under the fractal. That's a bit like if you have a trading market moving between a support level and a resistance level, then if it breaks out in one direction, if the price comes back again inside the channel, it is likely to be a false breakout. Also the bar which is doing the breakout is as much important than the fractal bar.

As we want to enter as soon as the fractal is broken to get the most of the move, then we have to change the way to exit. What do you think of using something like the following:

When the breakout occurs, we wait for the bar to close and we put a stoploss order 1 tick below or above the bar. But we don't wait for that next bar to close, as soon as the stoploss is triggered we exit.

Well I'm only trying to find a good way to reduce losses and I'm really insterested if you're experimenting a bit on a way to reduce losses and you want to share with us.

Cheers,

Daniel

Dvarrin.... my system for now is to enter only  after 3AO signal..... and also i enter with all my money and shoulders.... and then i use Money Management to exit.... but now i am trying to modify this system... using trend following system and money management as well. For example we have price went up for about 1% then i put stop loss on this price... and if market is going to reverse, stop liss will be hitted... But if price go higher, than we will have more profit  about 2-3%  and exit with 3AO signal in opposite side... or when alligator is closes....

Anyway this week i got about 7% of profit... and about 5% after all brokers fee's. I think thats nice.... We'll see what is next

--- 帖子 #553 ---
It is great to learn from all of you. By the way, I have confused about the Dbar formation (not angle). Since I have read Chinese translated "Trading Chaos 2nd" book, it would be better if someone tell me the original English word.

My book said the Dbar formation is:

1. 3 consecutive bar made lower low/higher high

2. the last bar closed below/above half of candle

My question is:

1. Does these 3 candles must be same type? for example: Bullish>Bullish>Bullish or Bearish>Bearish>Bearish? Since I saw many chart did not shown this rule. May we have Bearish>Bullish>Bearish or any other inconsistence combination?

2. Does the highest high or lowest low must be the 3rd bar? I saw many chart here shown the highest or lowest in 2nd or 1st bar, but my book did not mention about these formation.

3. Is the 3rd bar formation important? or just "close half" rule enough? For example, a Bullish DBar formation shown the 3rd bar close price lower than open price, but the close price still higher than half candle. Is it still valid DBar?

Thanks for any help in advance!

--- 帖子 #554 ---
raytracy, Dbar is a formation of simple Fractal... that has accute angle.. and also highest bar (for Bearish Dbar) closed in the bottom half.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Yes but I didn;t find it officially announced anywhere...

Trading is subjective and I decide when to enter on the chart picture and tools state (AO, AC, etc). Same is for the stops.

Yes this happens all the time and only your experience could help you what to do....

I use only H4 and D1 charts and I think that shrter time fremes are not suitable, but this is my point of view

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Isto they are suitable but you should be more concentrated... thats all

--- 帖子 #557 ---
What do you mean? I missed it... It seems I really should.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Ahh no problem, i was talking about short timeframes, like 5m ,10m....

IF you want to trade using them, then you should concentrate on one stock, or one pair....

So now i trade only 1 stock.... but there are many opportunities to trade during the day.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Yes this is style of trading. Each trader has own prefered time frame.

The main problem in lower time frames is false signals. But concentrating on the trading chart lot of them could be avoided.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Isto... i use only 2 kind of signals... 3AO and fractal.

3AO i get when trend is changing... and fractal i take when alligator is closed.

Thats all... And my opinion is that fractal give more false positions than 3AO....

Till this moment i had only 2 wrong 3AO signals.This situation turned to closed alligator..... in this case we should act on broken fractals.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi Isto and all other cheologists here

First I would like to commend you on a great thread, Me I just finished reading Bill Williams Trading Dimensions... And it was a very interesting and enjoyable read. I think this is just what I've been looking for since I myself am a trendtrader but one of my concerns is most of the systems I design are based on some constant variables which work currently and during backtests but I fear may no longer work in the near future (because the market constantly changes). Since then I've been looking for ways to create a constantly profitable trading system which relies on no constant variables, I want the market to be the one to dictate how the system should work and react... After reading Trading Dimensions I think he comes close to achieving this... since almost all constant variables have been removed in his profitunity system(except the "periods" from his indicators which is a time constant, sometime in the near future I hope to find a way to make the Market dictate what values to use for these as well)

Sorry for my excessive rambling... Anyways since you guys have been trading this for quite some time now I would just like to ask, when do you use the "Gator Oscillator" Indicator? Since it is not mentioned in Trading Dimensions but is included in MT4 indicators... Has this Indicator been mentioned in hes other books? I know what it calculates, but what are the rules for exits and entry signals based on the Gator?

Thanks and Good luck to all you cheologist!

Regards,

Mikhail

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Please publish some charts to clear the way you are using the signals.

I hope it will be interested for the other readers...

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi Again,

Just a simple indicator I made that colors the bars Green, Red, or Gray Depending on what trading Zone we are in based on the AO and AC. It was mentioned in trading dimensions to help determine add on and exits, and it looks nice on the charts

Enjoy!

here is a short example.... i enter after 3AO signal was triggered... and exit on 3AO green signal triggered... very simple i think

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi,

I wanted to ask you if in the second Edition of Trading Chaos the entry is still 1 pip above/below the fractal? Because I'm getting so many reversal just 1 or 2 pips after a fractal is triggered.

Well my opinion concerning triggering fractal... i put about 15 pips above it... just to be sure....

Hi,

I've some questions about the rules for the new Profitunity system.

Is the rule to exit after 2 closes above/below the 5 MA replacing the previous close above/below the teeth of the alligator or above/below the green line in a volatile market?

About the DBar, what are the exit rules after we entered? Do we have to take all the signals from other dimensions when we enter on a DBar?

Thank you very much in advance for your help!

Cheers,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hello Daniel,

No, all these rules are to help you understand the market. They are just sticks helping your move, but the move is yours.

DBar is step against the trend. So first few bars until trend is not yet reversed you have to watch carefully waht happens.

There are two opportunities - either:trend will reverse and the rules are well known reverse will fail either into side move or continuation of previous trend and then you've to get out fast

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Thank you very much isto! :-)

I'll test this system more. It looks really nice.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
In which one of the three books are the two closes above/below pink SMA 5 mentioned?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Great thread.  I used the Bill Williams methods for about a year with good success.  It's all about the add-on trades.  I ditched the oscillators and now only use the fractals as entries, add-ons, and support/resistence.  I just couldn't keep up with all of the oscillator signals.  I occasionally use the alligator to add on, gauge runaway markets, and when to start looking to get out when price is in the mouth.

Even though I'm doing completely different stuff now, the lessons learned were huge.  It's all about piling it on when you catch the trend.  Up until I saw this thread I haven't seen too many people do well with the system.  Mainly because they were afraid to add on.  You'll get eaten alive trying to catch breakouts out of the alligator in the forex market without taking the add on signals to make up the difference.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I have not seen the 5 sma in any of BW's Books I think its an add on from one of the forums. The first I saw of it was on the Yahoo group.

Somone correct me if I am wrong here.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Thank you very much for your answer Numb3rs :-)) I was wondering if I missed something in the books.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hello everybody.

I havent been here for a long time.... I have been testing my system... and what i  can say is It Really Works.....

The main rule is: Dont affraid... and always look on volumes..... they will tell you when signal is correct and when isn't

So i enter in all positions by 3AO signal and quit when price triggers my target (about 0.7%).

Also about 50% of time we have a side moving.... and now i am trying to make a theory, in what side will it probably go. I am trying to predict. For this moment all i can say, if you see side moving, put stop orders for long and short higher than maximum fractal of this moving and lower that lowest fractal.  It will give you about 1% on 5 minutes time frame.....

Also i found one interesting thing. Usually price will go in the same direction that it was before side moving... I identify direction by 2 max and 2 low fractals that was before side moving.... If first pair of hi/lo fractals is higher than hi/lo pair near side moving then probably price will go down and if lower then will go higher.... but actually it is still not proved

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I think that statement needs to be qualified.  There may be 50% sideways on intraday, but get up to the daily and higher charts and there rarely is sideways.

But knowing that means you can take the system to a whole new dimension (pun totally intended).  Confluence of multiple time frames.  Fractals and alligators of a different time frame can provide targets for entry/exit that might not be apparent in a single time a frame.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
how is it going ?  Can anybody post his results?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Jr97  i think its a good idea... maybe to look on 1h time frame or maybe 1d time frame....  and if its  direction is to the north then this side way on 5m time frame also will be to the north.... maybe maybe

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I am little new to this system. Could one of you please take a look and see if I am correct on the up coming entery points?

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #587 ---
i wouldn't go long because the fractal is formed inside the alligator's mouth. only go long if the price and the fractal is above the alligator's mouth and only go short if the price and fractal is below the alligaor's mouth.

i am not sure, but i probably wouldn't go short either. while AC is indicating short, AO is not.

anyway, that's what i would or better yet wouldn't do. hope it helps.

btw, i use bill william's theory together with another system, so i look at 2 systems for a trade

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi traders,

Vacation is over and we could continue digging our systems.:

Wish success to all of you.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Numb3RS you are absolutely right! and also look on AO.... it is slightly going up... this mean side moving. Also another point is that before side moving price went down... so probably in future it will go down... my oppinion.... please write us what happens next

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Thanks BBPI and Protei. My feeling is it will go short also, but then only want what the market wants . I will post on what happens next np.

Hi all,

This is my second day on this forum, and although I have been able to digest (albeit with plenty of burps!) what all has been written here, wouldn't it be worthwhile if somebody could summarize this strategy?

Isto, you've been the 'father' of this forum, would be great if you could jot down the details of your 'baby', to help beginners like me find their way.

Things like stop-loss and take profit levels, entry-exit signals, etc. could be summarized...of course strictly without any liablity on the person writing these out.

Cheers!

Dave

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I'm also new to this system, I'm currently reading 'Trading Chaos', does there seem to be a time frame for trading this system that is most effective?  Have you more experienced traders found better luck with it on a daily chart or does it matter?

Another quest I have is Divergent Bars, if you are in a trade and an opposite divergent bar forms, is this a signal to close your position?

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Concerning time frames i could say that there is no best time frame.... you will find your own time frame in future.... i tried 15 minutes 1 hour, and now i am using 5 minutes....  I think this is my time frame.... i like it because of its rapid movement.... i can make 2 trades per day.... so i feel like  i am on the work...

Concerning trading system. I think Wiiliam's system cannot be used as it is... but with some modifications it is really nice.  For this 4 days i made about 3%... only yeasterday i lose 1% because of my stupidity.... there was side moving... and so on side moving i went many times on short and long position without any signals.... maybe becos of my nerves.... i dont know.... if i had been trading using  signals i would have done so many mistakes....  and had only about -0.5%... anyway in the end i concentrated and went on long position for next day.

Look on this chart... and also look on volumes...

--- 帖子 #594 ---
One question to Chaos trader ...

I read the book and it seems that Bill proposed Elliot wave as the method. But it seems to me the charts in this thread has no Elliot wave count. Has the method evolved away from EW ?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I think there is noneed  anymore to count waves... because it is really impossible to count them. I tried it a lot... but failed....   My opinion is to trade chart as it is. If you try to predict chart, you will fail.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Ajone92:

I have traded all or part of the Profitunity way since 1999--futures initially, Forex since early 2004. In my experience, the Profitunity way can be profitable in all time frames and in all markets just as Williams claims for it; but it has been the most successful for me when I took my action reads off of the daily time frame charts.

As for divergent price bars, I have not found any reasonablly consistent signficance to a divergent bar that did not appear after a heathy Alligator chase.

Protei:

I too often trade a system that is not textbook Profitunity, but I would argue that it needs no help to be a profitable system. I emblish it because I believe my tweaks increases the probability of a trade being profitable.

Williams says in all three of his books that the Elliott Wave is the underlying structure of a market, and that fractals are the underlying structure of Elliott Waves. Williams says in New Trading Dimensions (p.62), "If the current price is outside the Alligator's mouth, we are in an impulsive wave of one degree or another. If the price is meandering around the Balance lines, we are in a reactive wave of one degree or another." We know that ideally, we want to enter our trade early in an impulsive EW, and that we do not want to enter our trade while it is in a reactive EW. Williams says in Trading Chaos 2nd Edition (p.142), " A Fractal is always a change in behavior caused by new incoming information (chaos)." Putting all this together means we can indeed trade the EW without counting waves. For my own trading, I use these realities of market behavior to decide whether or not I want to take the 2nd Wise Man signal (Super AO signal)... I will even occassionally buy off a fractal low when it is in an impulsive EW or sell off a fractal high that is in an impulsive EW.

Profitunity is certainly not the only system that can be traded profitably; in fact, it may not even be the best system one might choose, but it is a darn good one built on a uniquely solid technical foundation; and it has been a good one for me.

Dlftrader... the main i dont like in Williams system is that we should add our position on each signal.... usually system allows us to enter when moving is only forming....  and if we enter with all money i think it will be more profitable. thats my opinion

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Protei  If you enter with all money at the start, the trades that fail will eat you up. I think you might have gotten confused on the way BW adds to positions. It should be ALWAYS the first position is like just dipping your toe in the pool to test the water. Start with 1 contract or lot. You can use a set up like this 1,5,4,3,2... or 1,2,4,3... However you do it, it should always start with 1 then load up and then scale down. The other option is to just add 1 for every entry signal that comes up.(since I am new to this system the add only 1 is the way I do it for now).

Dlftrader, would you be kind enough to stick around on this thread and make comments? I think your experience would be most helpful.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
numb3rs:
I do look in on this thread most everytime my email tells me new posts have been made.  My posting to it (or any forum thread for that matter) has to clear two hurdles--1) I have the time to post and 2) I think I might be able to make some helpful comments.  This means I am in a forum thread many more times than I post to it.  I have this sign on the bulletin board that hangs over my trading screens: "Nobody knows as much as you think they know!"  Remember that when you read any of my stuff, too!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Well i still stand on my point of view. If you enter on 1 signal with 1 lot.. you will loose money.... becos usuall situation is price hit 1 signal... then it goes up you enter on 2 signal with 4 lots.. and after making 0.2% price goes down and you close your position with 1 lot in profit and 4 lots with loss.... this is how i lost money...

--- 帖子 #603 ---
have u consider the angulation before taking it as wiseman1 ??

u must have at least 5 criteria before consider it as wiseman1

if u enter wiseman 1 wrongly..surely wiseman 2 risky :d

one more thing.. do make a trailing stop because wiseman1 n w2 are counter trend...and w3 acts independant

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I totally understand what you mean. This is why I only add 1 lot per entery at this time since I have not become good enough at this to make a fair judgment of safe enteries. Infact most of the time I will let W1 and W2 pass me by and just take W3 for a safe entry.

Hi all,

Since there are quite some editions and books by Bill Williams (2 editions each for "New trading dimensions" and "Trading chaos"), which would be the best / latest / most updated one to read?

Thanks in advance,

Dave.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Bill william has authored 3 books

1st : Trading Chaos

2nd:  New Trading Dimension

3rd : Trading Chaos II

I think you should go for the latest book Trading Chaos II which has taught about the wiseman1,2 and 3..

So again .. Go for Trading CHaos II .. The Black color cover book that authored by bill william and her daughter

--- 帖子 #607 ---
My advice is that you read all of Bill Williams books there is so much to learn from him.

I was able to find Trading Chaos 1 and New trading Dimensions on emule and I purchased Trading Chaos 2 from Amazon. All of them were worth reading. On emule I even found a video of one of Bill Williams seminars.

If you only want to read one book though, Trading Chaos 2 is the most resent and it covers some what you will find in both of his first two books.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
If it is possible, could you please put here all of these wiseman's

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Here is an example.... how will you trade this chart.... what next will you do..

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Ok I will give it a shot.

It apears to me that the only entry we have on the chart is to use the Fractals. From what I understand Wiseman 3 will allways be a fractal.

Wiseman 1 is a Dbar with angulation from the alligator. Wiseman 2 is a three bar color change on the OA.

Anyone feel free to step in and correct me but this is how I understand it from the book.

Hi traders

I see lately in this thread many discussions about this method and charts that apply it.

I think (and hope you'll agree with me) that it will be better to separate discussions from the description of the method.

This is why I've opened a new thread devoted to discussions - there, every interested trader to be able to post his/her charts, ask for advise, comments posted charts, etc.,

This is to make easier for newcommers to follow the main idea of the method here, in this thread and if interested to follow discussions about the method separately.

Now it becomes hard to devide the idea of the method from number of explanationas and discussions followed description of the system.

You could see the new tread here: Forums > Forex Discussion > Chaos

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Numb3rs, you are absolutely right.. exactaly what i did. Look on chart....

Also could anyone post all this wisemans and how to use them

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Food for Thought:Before Trading Chaos II, we were taught to look for a quiet Alligator--extended balance lines relatively flat (the flatter the better)--and AO and AC values on or near their zero lines.  This setup was designed to catch fractal breakouts.  We judged the quality of that setup signal by how long a market looked like this.  We usually got whipsawed more than we wanted, but it was in what Williams called "the low rent district" (small losses). Trading Chaos II teaches a significantly different setup.  We are now looking for a major bottom or top--the Alligator is in full pursuit of bulls or bears, AO and probably AC are supporting the Alligator's direction, and a new extreme price candle is divergent with a strong angleulation.  This setup is designed to catch key reversals in a market. Remember, the 3 Wise Men strategy gets us into a countertrend trade.  It is essential that there be a high probability of a market reversal.  You may want to use additional indicators that the current trend direction is exhausted.  For my own Profitunity trading, I require that the new low be lower than the two previous fractal lows, and that the new high be higher than the two previous fractal highs.  In addition, I usually will require that the current trend extreme be at least a 62% retracement of the previous swing in the opposite direction (I am more comfortable when the retracement exceeds 76.4%). ...\larry.bye

Sorry but no i don't. I use MT4. If you are not able to find code you need just remember the five bar rule for fractals that BW explanes in the video.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
No Problem.

Thanks. That will be much better.

Do u have fractal, awes. osc.,, files in MT4 format if so , i can get them convert into EFS format. If u do have the files pls PM me or post here.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #629 ---
These are all the Trading Chaos indicators I have. The fractals indicator is built info MT4 and I cant seem to find the code for it. But, I have a Fractals alert indicator I included but be aware that it does have false fractals at times because it does not repaint like the original fractals indicator.

Have you tried youtube? Anyways, there's really nothing much about the video since it only talks about fractal. And the video is way too old. There's no alligator and AO. Basically, it talks the same things as in the book =)

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I got the video off of emule last year but i don't seem to have copy anymore. It was a seminar Bill did a long time ago. Its old stuff. The book is more informational.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
wow..you still here. do you still trade this method?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Yup I'm still around. I have been using Point and Figure Support and resistance.

BW's method is still a good one. Well worth learning about.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
And how about stop losses? How are it placed?

Thank You,

--- 帖子 #641 ---
above the last or second last fractal - while this depends on the circumstances on every trade - there is no definite answer, you could also trail your stop or exit at the green trendline.

when entering on a bdb you place it right at the opposite end of that bdb.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi Slight,

Can you please explane me why on the Chaos Theory book #1,when talking about one of the magic bullets is the MACD, be long when the 5-bar average is higher than both the 13-bar and 34-bar averages. And on the MetaTrader the Parameters are 13/ 8 / 5 , for the Alligator. Are they talking about the same indicator?

Or do i have to set on the MetaTrader the parameters for the Alligator on 5/13/34 , i am confused! Thank you.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Trading Chaos 1st edition is an older version of the methodology used by Bill Williams. I suggest you get hold of the newest edition Trading Chaos 2nd edition. There you have a complete description of the methodology, its indicators  and how to use them all (including settings).

What you are talking about is another indicator, I think the MFI, which Bill Williams doesn't use anymore, as he states in his latest book.

The first book, the one you are reading, is really only good for counting Elliott Waves. The strategy you better get from the latest book. This way Metatrader indicators (Alligator, AO, Fractals) will work perfectly as you need them...

--- 帖子 #644 ---
guys, am back , have read and understood bw books , made my trade and won 75 pips today.Good for me after losing som much in so few weeks.There is still something though thats stil confusing me about the fractals.A buy fractal may appear sometims whilst there is a reversal in direction , and the sell fractal might appaer after a big move and would have missed early entry.Is it correct to just get in without a fractaal showing in the direction of the trade or we MUST wait for that fraactal to appear?.
http://www.forexfactory.com/images/misc/progress.gif

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Of course the fractal is your signal.. if you just enter somewhere, don't be surprised if you are in for a bad trade. The point with this system is being able to optimize "sell high, buy low" .. and follow the trend right through to the opposite direction. Well I guess you could also enter on the AO .. but just entering like that without a fractal .. even though you are convinced this is the right direction.. I wouldnt do it.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I guess i do not have very good luke, i am not able to get the chaos secound edition book because i am from Costa Rica en Amazon do not delivers books to Costa Rica. I try some other places unsuccesfuly.

The first book i downloaded in a FDF formatt  "ebook" but this one i am not able to find it.

Can you please tell me if there is a way of somehow i can get that book? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I mean, do you always , buy or sell on a fractal, eg in this chart , at 1.43500, there is a buy fractal yet its clear that its a sell on both the AO and AC , how don you expalain it?

--- 帖子 #648 ---
According to what is in the 2nd book you would have been long there, because its triggered above the red line. AO doesnt matter in this case. I dont pay any attention to AC. Personally I like to incorporate the Elliott Wave count in my trading desicions..

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hm I suppose you could try to ask Bill Williams himself and explain your situation to him. You can get in touch with him over profitunity.com

Other than that I don't know what you could do if Amazon doesn't send the book to your country.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
I should try that!!

Before i do that, i found this linke and I dont know if this link has the lates version of the system, can you please take a look at it and let me know??

Thank you for all your help.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Sorry this is the link :http://www.alpari-forex.com/en/chaos/

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Nice link - it will tell you all you need to know. Just only use from the right menu the links to "Bill Williams' Alligator", "Fractal as the first market Dimension" and "Awesome Oscillator - AO" .. the rest of the links I dont know about and nothing is said about them in the 2nd book.

If you lack information these categories provide you, go to the beginning of this thread and combine the instructions there with what you read at your link.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Thank you Slight,

Does the rule of placing the stop lost one candle back with lower low (higher high) on a higher time frame still valid? when placing the first trade?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
I've never heard of that rule. For stops at the beginning with a smaller account you can use the last fractal or the 2nd last fractal. You can also trail it by 5 bars.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I see,

I read about it in the Chaos Theory first book.

And what about profit taking, when do you take profits?

--- 帖子 #656 ---
You should really read the book. It clears all of that up and more.

There is no profit taking with this method. You ride the trend and exit at the green line or wait until you get stopped out.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
I see,

Thank you for taking the time to help me out!!

Hi Numb3rs,

Yeah, I like this system.. and wanne be master of it..

Hi Isto,

Great Thread!!!

I just have one question, when placing the first trade, do i place the stop just higher or lower of the previus fractal? "on the oposit direction fractal"

And ones i am in the trade and turns aginst me, do i wait untill the price hits my stop or do i use the green or red line "Aligator" to get out,

im confuced ,,thank you for taking the time to help me out.

I am reading through Trading Chaos right now.

I just read about calculating market facilitation index ( MFI ) which uses TICK VOLUME to ascertain whether the current market in a trend market or range.

In the first post made by Isto

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=26044

I dont see him using MFI or using Tick Volume.I think if someone can implement MFI, we can have a much larger win ratio by this method.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
The MFI is a 2 bar indicator. How would you judge if we are in a ranging market or trending market by looking at 2 bars?

--- 帖子 #681 ---
The MFI is outdated but still can be used as a supporting tool. BW emphasize in using the AO in his latest Trading Chaos.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Though I ve not seen anyone i know using MFI, from reading about MFI, I find it to be very logical .

Are u sure if AO is used to find whether a given market is trendy or range ?

Do u have MFI indicator for MT4 platform ? I would be grateful if u can give that to me .

Hi guys,

I found this pdf file which gives a pretty good detail summary on the chaos system.

check it out.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
it was a good read. But not detailed enough for me. I want to know more of the wiseman as described by Justine ppt slide.

There doesnt seem to be much stuff out there on the net. I've search on this forum , but fragments here and there.

I found this link, good video and how to use stochastics with alligator.

I will be posting my results shortly based on the the pdf

--- 帖子 #688 ---
The book and the pdf of those two previous posts refer to CHAOS I, whilst the ppt presentation and (the whole WIseman1 concept) refer to CHAOS II, which is a different book -  actually the third!

Forex37

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I will have to add "chaos 2" book to my shopping list.

anyway, last night I placed four trades and only one was successful. even worse, I incorrectly calculated the lot size causing huge losses.

I'm reflecting where I went wrong .

the blue lines are the stop loss/ take profit while the green is the entry.

But to summarize, I should have bailed out when the priced striked the teeth, but since my trading style is to place a trade and let it run, it doesnt suit me. Also I should wear glasses when I trade. the 3/4 trades were clearly non trending. I just noticed that after watching my video journal. another thing I have to remember but not relatd to williams, not trade same base pair at the same time for multiple trades.

Bad Trade -

I should have not traded, large spike in the last hour. I got mislead by the slope direction indicator. But clearly non trending

http://mindsetofamaster.com/forex/media/badtrade.JPG

http://mindsetofamaster.com/forex/media/badtradend.JPG

also as pdf clearly says on page5

I neglected this, infact totally wrong, but I was on track with the next

Good Trade -

The stochastics sell signal helped filter this trade. I placed my stop loss on the bottom fractal and take profit above the previous buy fractal. also I traded away from lip and was trending upwards. also buy fractal formed above alligator mouth.

http://mindsetofamaster.com/forex/media/goodtrade.JPG
http://mindsetofamaster.com/forex/me...odtradeend.JPG

I noticed that the winning trade had symbol "5" before entering (see under bottom fractal) but disappeared later.

But I kinda get it, the buy fractal must be above the alligators mouth.

more later

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hello Alexis, can I get copy?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
The bollinger bands tell me there will be a large breakout shortly.

I want to test the williams method, preferably get some input from the "EXPERTS" before the market reopens and check the accuracy of  this method first hand.

http://mindsetofamaster.com/forex/me...atorAUDUSD.jpg

anyway, here goes!!

alligator is trending up previously, the price has just cut through the alligator's teeth. Probably a good time to close the position. (But I get a funny feeling that it's going to breakout, instead perfect time to open a position????)

Gator is showing the distance between the mouth of the alligator, and shows mouth closed. But mouth will open shortly (p4/18)

AC is showing TWIN PEAKS BUY Signal (p8/18).

AO is showing red bars, the last two show it's descending. I guess if the next bar is green. then we get the "SAUCER BUY SIGNAL) (p6/18)

BW MFI indicator is showing volume decreasing and BWMFI is pointing higher. which means It's heading in one direction (reference p18/18)

Conclusion is?

I think that the market will shoot up dramatically based on the assumption on AC. But once the AO shows a green bar above zero. this will be confirmed.

If I'm right, does that mean, I enter the trade with the market hits 72.09 (the last fractal - sell).

--- 帖子 #692 ---
When the market opened, it jumped 42 pips. no big deal. (see above 0.7185 to 0.7227)
http://mindsetofamaster.com/forex/me...rAUDUSDWIN.jpg

Unfortunately, my account expired, but I re-entered the trade an hour later.

But like usual, when the market gaps up, it usually gaps down later.

infact the next hour.

Risk %                     3.0%        Take Profit Price    0.72410

Current Price            0.72020     Stop Loss Price    0.71630

Stop Loss Distance    39

Take Profit Distance   39

The risk/reward is about equal. I exited just now from the trade.

I managed to reopen a new practice account in the nick of time, but made a measily 20 pips. But I made two trades as I was confident. Also , when I came in late, the risk/reward was bad. and dont recommend it. I exited my trade early, but I predict it will go higher.

If I can repeat this 7 days a week, this would be good. time will tell.

Hi all:: I have glanced through Bill Williams books and they look interesting to me but i could not read them completely (boring due to philosophical details).

I have 3 point

1:: Has any one of you gentleman tried this system on live account and what were the result??? Is this system worth a try?? should one devote himself to this system leaving others???

2:: I have 2 or 3 books of Bill Williams in pdf format; will it be ok / legal to post them here if some one wants them???

3::Can any gentleman please draw a comparison between this system and the other systems like 4H Nanningbob; 4H Hekin Ashi; 4H cornflower etc

--- 帖子 #699 ---
This method is used by many..... and it is as effective as you make it... you will have to study and practise as with any system.

I dont think you would have to post the books as they are already posted in a few places.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
bill williams is like every other system, this method not good for scalping or low momentum market...so u need to study it very well...i have traded it before and still use this system sometime but i dont post on it anymore..

it will take time but u will find it useful if u add good MM .

--- 帖子 #701 ---
It won´t be enough to trade the 3 W men!!

You need to filter, either Fibo, or some other system you are familiar with.

I just use the 3 W Men as triggers, once I find a place to enter, calculating Fibos, start 4 H , refine 15 min. Enter 5 Min using 3 WM.

Or weekly/ dayly/ hour (provided you don´t sleep and control your trades at night!)

Fibos on Time  axis are very important too..

Piramiding is paramount, just go by the book.

Bullish bar: 1 Contract

AO: 5 Contracts

Fr : 4

Exactly opposite than taking out portions as you become profitaböle which is one of the most negative practices on performance.

Why?:You get hit when  stopped in the beginning, with a full load,but  on your highest profits you arrive (at best) with half a position.

Bill Williams piramiding works,  on your favour: you get hit either with only one contract or maybe 6, seldom with 10.

All your winners are full loads!

Still just the system alone as entry will hardly break even.

Also try an account without fixed contracts, like OANDA or RBS Marketindex.

You can tailor the size of every position exactly, with some simple excell work.

Literally practice risking cents.

Gotta be fun...

Enjoy life...

I read Williams' book and I was quite dissapointed. I see that many people follow his 'chaos' approach, but this is how I see it. I don't like to be destructive, but I like to call things by their names. On the other hand, some contributions are quite valuable, as I depict below.

In addition this is my opinion. If there is something wrong below, please do not hesitate to respond this post. If I am wrong, I prefer to know.

Fractals: local maximums and minimums. Nothing else.

Awesome Oscillator: the difference between the 34-period and 5-period simple moving averages of the bar's midpoints (H+L)/2. That is, the MACD of 5 and 34 applied to the midpoint of High and Low instead tothe close.

Acceleration Oscillator:
MIDPOINT PRICE = ( HIGH + LOW ) / 2

AO = SMA ( MIDPOINT PRICE, 5 ) – SMA ( MIDPOINT PRICE, 34 )

AC = AO – SMA ( AO, 5 )

That is, the Acceleration Oscillator is the MACD histogram, i.e., the MACD minus its signal. Again, the MACD computed on hte midpoint. Nothing new. (well, the MACD signal is usually an EMA, not a SMA)

The Alligator: another way of displaying three moving averages.

The interesting contributions I see here are:

- all the signals of buy and sell described for the AO. Deep study, which at least at first glance, is valid also for MACD.

- the Alligator, it is not the use fo a smoothed MA but the forward displacement what makes it extremely interesting.

- the Gator Oscillator, which depicts two MACDs in the same graphic (one for the jaw/teeth MA and one for the teeth/lips). I think this oscillator deserves more in-depth study, which I will try to do in my free time.

Best regards and lots of pips to everyone.

Gonso, I like to call things by their name as well: You`ve read the books (Chaos2 as well?) - but you haven`t digested them yet.

You have seen the tires, a little engine, some spoilers.... but you haven`t recognized the BMW yet - nor the instructions how to race!!!!! This is understandable, as BW is a top systems creator, but a lousy writer.

BW has taken parts of TA, reshaped, retooled and renamed them - and put them in a connection (for example alligator as deciding when and how to use fracal) and finally applied a unique mm system to all of this.

Does his system work on cable all the time? No. Does it work on currencies all the time? YES. Because it will tell  you which underlying NOT to touch at a given time.

So read the book(s) 3-5 times - just to memorize the facts. Only then try to analyze the parts and their interaction. And finally the mm.

BW system is a self-contained closed system, nothing should be taken away, adding won`t help much either - just like P&F, 3LB, Ichimoku, M.I.D.A.S. ....just to name a few.

I totally agree. Maybe I need those 3 or 5 times more of reading.

But maybe my message was a bit misunderstood (which means that my writing may be a bit lousy as well). I didn't mean to reject BW's system. I just disagree on the fact that it is chaos.

Thanks for the comments and Lots of Pips to all.

open for discussion on this subject, so thought I wanna share what know about

chaos trading system.

In his books ,I thought Dr. Bill Williams mention something about the data inflow Factals,Alligator, Awesome Ossilators etc...

The usual data-base for moving averages and macd...etc...are linear-data type of input.

BUT for the Chaos trading system, the data inflows taken into the systems are Non-Linear type of data.

So although the displays may almost look the same,the may not be the same.

"Similar but not Exact".

Just read the book again, you will rediscover this statement somewhere in the

Chaos.

Cheers!

Hmm bro...how can you teach newbie profitunity chaos in this way when you have 3 different colors of bars....i use this system also very well but i dont even understand those signal on your chart....it look so different ..

--- 帖子 #716 ---
GBPAUD - similar situation. Go up!!!

--- 帖子 #717 ---
We must see who is stronger. AUD or CAD...

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Canadian stronger than the Australian. GBPAUD buy looks better!

First thing first, BW Chaos trading system is a Trend System.

Thus the message.."Do not trade when the alligator sleeps(intertwines)"

The chart below, Daily EU, implies the Alligator is wide awake for several

months since may 2009....It could be suffering from Insomnia of some kind..

But of course it takes awhile to understand this simple BW message...

Hello AT !

Nice to read your post !

When you have a chance, would you mind to post a chart with the indicators you are talking about on it ?

Thank you very much for your help.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Yes AvidTrader, very good and informative post. Thanks for the additional information. Is Dr.BW`s DVD course reflecting the changes - or still reflecting NewTradingDimensions?

So thanks again

Question to the resident experts:

Fractal`s Edge (Herberts) was a system alike (or derived/copied/white labelled from)  Profitunity (Dr BW) - but with modified names/parameters for the AO, AC, Gator and Alligator. Where BW uses parameters with shifts they claimed unshifted ones.

The web is said never to forget, but regarding Fractals`s edge it has been made to forget. So, does anybody know the params/details to reengineer TFE: The Picket Fence, Tripwire, Wall, MO, ACC, Gatekeeper, e-wave and VRR?

Thanks a lot

Thanks for showing the chart. Very Informative.

p/s I have been to one of Dr BW seminars in Asia in 1995. And have been enjoying chaos trading since.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Thank you for the chart !

I don't remember BWs was using the RSI.... I remember he was using MACD before developing the AO....

Any comment about the RSI ?

All the best

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hi AvidTrader,

Thanks for the chart. I noticed you show 120min timeframe. Any reason for this?

As I also use Dealbook I noticed also that you didn`t apply fractals (in a subpane). Just not showing or not trading?

Thank you for your kind reply.

Hello Guys,

What do you think about the GBPUSD situation ? Ready for the wave 4 ?

--- 帖子 #728 ---
An update of the situation. Some profit is already locked.

Now, I'm watching some levels of concern. I marked a chart.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Since trading currencies, about a year and a half, I struggled with a comfortable time frame.  I probably have spent most of my time in the first year getting comfortable with the right one for me. I now use 2 hour time frames to trade to take advantage of the overnight markets so I can sleep and make money at the same time.  I exit a lot off of 15 minute time frames as a lot of the time when a 15 minute time frame completes a FULL 5 waves there is usually a very high probability there will be a end to that immediate 2 hour time frame trend.  Not all the time but but a majority of the time.

I switch back and forth between bars and candlesticks depending on what I want to look at......just an executive decision.  I am not familiar with "apply fractals in a subpane",  maybe you can tell me how you do that in Dealbook so I can see what you are talking about.  But at this point, I can spot a fractal whether its a bar or candlestick in half a heartbeat so I really don't really need to "mark" it as one.  I am also looking at a lot of BDB's to enter or exit a trade too.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Avid Trader, the use of 2 time frames really makes sense to me. Waves inside waves that is the way to spot end of a move.

I'm using also a lot Fibonacci levels.

BW's 1st book is really a gold mine for that part. When you understood that method, it is so easy to know where we are on a move.

All the best !

--- 帖子 #731 ---
I completely agree.

All the best to you too!!

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi Avid,

Thanks for the input all this while.Your thoughts and comments are highly appreciated by all Chaos traders out there.

If it is not too much to ask for, could you grace this thread with examples of trades you took.

To Star, thanks dude for your dedication and hard work all this while.I hope more to come from you.

Keep up the good work guys.

Pips to Chaos traders.

Hello AvidTrader,

Which timeframe , do you use for intraday trading with Chaos Trading System?

Do you think its effective with 5mins or 15mins scalping?

Hope it will give some kind of light for ForexFactory newbies.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
It can be used on any time frame but the method is designed to catch long trends.  Since trading Forex for the last 18 months I struggled to find the appropriate time frame to achieve the most pips.  I wanted to be able to profit in the London market while I was sleeping (I live in California).  Dr. Bill Williams lives close to me and he has become a friend, and he invited me over a couple of times to his home for some private consulting.  He suggested I play longer time frames.  He said to stay away from day trading because I would never achieve the large gains he is used to achieving.

I played around with 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr time frames and finally came to the conclusion that 2hr time frames were optimal in trading the Forex for me.  I trade a dozen different pairs but I like the EUR/JPY and the GBP/JPY the best because of their large pip movements.  With the 2 hr time frames I can easily count the waves and it is most dependable.  I also look at 4 hr time frames and sometimes daily's to confirm an entry.  I use a lot of BDB's to enter a trade.  I guess about 50/50 between BDB's and fractals to enter trades.  I also use 15 min time frames to confirm a BDB on a 2 hr time frame to enter.  Many times a full 5 waves occur on a 15 min time frame and the first 15 min fractal break occurs on a BDB 2 hr time frame which only gives me additional confirmation of a good calculated trade.  Once I enter I add on according to what the 2 hr time frame tells me to do.

Although at times I do trade 5 min and  15 time frames I do not rely on only trading within those time frames.  Over the long haul I usually end up only breaking even and the stress of those time frames can wear you out.  I would rather just wait for a good 2 hr time frame set up.  I do use those lower time frames to exit trades, especially the 15 min time frames as the Forex can radically move over 2 hrs as I'm sure you know, and I would rather cash out and then re-enter to continue the 2 hr time frame trend.

Hope this helps........

So-So.. I only have 1 year experience with this methodology after purchasing profitunity DVD

--- 帖子 #741 ---
You got the course? WOW!!!!

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi!

@AvidTrader

I'm currently trying the profitunity methology too, however i have some problems not getting caught in range markets. I know the gator should actually protect me from things like that, but when trading forex, many fractals get triggered and stopped out shortly after. Is there any kind of "filter" you apply to choose the right BDBs? I'm using the 1 and 2 hour charts and still find myself on the losing side far too often using the chaos system. Do you look on a higher timeframe for confirmation, or do you watch out for divergence? I know BWs latest book (trading chaos 2nd edition), but i'm somehow not able to put it into practice.

Thanks a lot!

Jakob

Hello JaKob

Yes, you are right. It is not ok just to take signals as they appear....

Personally, I really recommend to do the Elliott Wave and Fibonacci analysis, as BW brilliantly describe in is book #1. Then, you will know where the market is and where it is likely incline to go.... Quite useful no ,

This will really help to filter.

You can have an idea of this method, live by clicking on the link in my signature, I'm posting charts there.

Also, I like what AvidT is doing, using longer TF. Stronger signals there, but stops can be a bit big....

Syu !

Thanks AvidTrader and starskovsky!

I'll visit the chat room next week!

I've been asking myself if the wave count is necessary, or if the Chaos System could be used without it, as Satni said? (or used with the fibonacci numbers instead)

I just bought the other 2 books and will start reading them now, but since BW didn't seem to use the EW count in the latest book, i was wondering if they have to be used to make the system profitable?

Thanks a lot!

Jakob,

Well, as far as I could remember, as was told by Dr Bill Williams.

"Chaos trading systems is for those who want to trade Elliott Waves,

without knowing the Elliott Waves." There also similar comments by BW

in his first book.

Since I know both, I thought I might as well use them. But I dont stop

my knowledge flows with other newer and brighter systems which are

crystal clear too.

We are always a student of the market, as always .

--- 帖子 #756 ---
The AO is the indicator to help with wave count and diversion.  You could trade the method with just the Alligator and fractals.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Yes..Very true indeed.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Seasons Greetings:

I am a new member and will start trading Forex in 2010.

I am a BW fan and I have read everything that I can on his ideas.

BW is the best IMHO.

I also am an intense Elliott Wave user and I believe in objective wave counting.

I hope that I have a few tricks that I can add to the BW/EW tools set and that I can be a useful member of this thread.

My goal is to enhance my family finances in order to help those less fortunate.

yep mate i think small tf on this method is heartbreak..i only stick to 1hr bdb or WM2 for entry or historical support and resistance well the wave thing is hard for me to understand but using this system with my TLOC method i am able to see trend reversal and continuation..it all take sometime to understand but i feel it's like every other system in the market just that different interpretation..Trading Chaos is my major system i understand and as long as i catch my pips adding PA to it then Green is all mine..Lol

Merry Christmas all and wish all the best next year...

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Hi Wab ! welcome ! I hope I'll be able to help you too. Let's discuss about Wave counting and BW's techniques !

I'm posting some charts on my website (link in the signature) and I'm participating in Avid's chat room.

Hope to see you there too.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Sounds like you have a good handle on your method.  I like catching wave2 entries too.  I just stretch it out to 2 hr tf's.  I find I get better BDB entries with 2hr tf.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
The best way to gain a sense of what an author is trying to convey is to probably read the book. This is a great book. But how amazing is it that two people can read the same book but come away with completely different interpretations?

I didn't see any system described in Bill Williams book. Sure he talks about waves and gets into specifics and talks about certain indicator settings and so on. But, I mean if you read the book and possess a decent sense of reading comprehension how can you say there is a system here?

On page 2 it says, "Nonsense replaced common sense. Our interest became centered around moving averages, stochastics, RSI, MACD, ...Market profile hit the scene but was hampered because it used parametric statistics in a nonparametric world(the market)...we have taken a practical and commonsense job of trading, dressed it in fancy language, and turned it into something very abstract and difficult...the process of trading has been transformed into a pseudo-intellectual science; traders think they must strain their brains at it in order to profit...good trading does not emanate from the head, it emanates from the gut and the heart"

I'll leave it at that. It just amazes me how people actually focus on everything BUT trading. The project targets into an unknowable future, they backtest and look for nonexistent patterns, they misinterpret texts....they do everything except pay attention to getting a good sense of what is happening at the right edge of the chart.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I am gradually working my way towards more naked trading but I do like some indicators that I find help a lot.

One is the RSI - but I use a RSI 3.  I have become very used to how it signals, but only on a daily time frame.  (Sometimes on the four hour, below that is gets wonky.)  I set it with 20 and 80 and find that the nice tight M and W divergence patters it makes at tops and bottom are really good.  It is also good to draw trend lines on and watch to see where they break.  There are other signals that it generates but that is a whole separate topic.

Another is the Directional Index system that I set at a standard 14 with horizontal lines at 16 and 40.  Signals tend to be valid above 16 and tend to end as the ADX turns down and crosses back below 40.

Combining these with fractals and the AO are really good in my opinion.

Two others I use are right in the chart, the BW Zone indicator turns the bars green, red, or grey depending on the AO and AC being in phase.  Another is one that tries to alert you to the BDB.  Emphasis on tries , but it does give you a heads up and then the RSI 3 is a good filter.

And of course fractals.  Got have them on the chart.

Might as well add Bollinger Bands for some more information.

Then there are trend lines, Fibonacci levels and so on.

Finally I have a bar timer that tells you how much of the bar remains before a new bar occurs.  Not really needed in daily trading.

Here is a sample with some signals on the RSI 3 shown.

I find it all helps me to know the market's structure and I get to see the indicators behaving as I expect they should if I understand the structure correctly.

http://www.elkvalleygold.com/Forex/F...%20dec3109.jpg

The above GBPUSD chart is at a point where I suspect it will rally up in to a wave Three. I have been scalping it a bit until it reaches a smaller wave 2 then I will try for a long BW daily trade so that I can catch the Three and ride it.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
dont say i didnt tell you..you dont need all those indicator on your chart ..you will always get confuse maybe not now but soon or later u will understand...trading chaos 2nd edition is just AO,alligator and fractal breakout ....u can add what so ever u want but i think you have add more than enough ...keep it simple..

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Happy New Year!!!

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Dr. Bill Williams definitely has a "method" but not a system.  There is quite a distinction in that.

What he is trying to communicate is that market patterns cannot perfectly duplicated so it's futile to expect markets to repeat the same patterns over and over again with the same price action.

He method is based off of trader's behavior not price itself. His indicators are set up to take advantage of market or trader "behavior".  That is what BDB's and fractals are about.  His entry signals are specific based off BDB's, fractals, and what the moving averages or "Alligator" is doing at that specific time.

Exits are based off the same thing.  What each bar is doing in relation to the Alligator.  He states that his "method" is the "Holy Grail" of trading which I would have to agree considering how well his method gets you into and out of a trade.

When you truly understand his method you'll be hard pressed to come across a better one and if you do I sure would like to see it.  I have done many trades where I caught the top of a trend and exited and the bottom of the trend.  I have done it in many different time frames but for the Forex I mainly trade off of 2 hour time frames and at times 15 min tf's.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Well, those things can help give you an idea of what's happening, sure. But after a while you really don't need them. You don't need all of that methodological complexity to understand tops and bottoms and middles - just a good understanding of proportion and of highs and lows.

Well anyway, he does describe the process of going from a novice to a successful trader. I believe he describes being in the most proficient state as being able to flow deeply within chaos, or something to that effect. I don't have the book handy. But, in my opinion, the methods described are really meant as helpers and as training wheels, until you know exactly what to look for, and how to approach trading.

So, while he does include a very detailed explanation of "method", there is one sentence in the book towards the back that reads "90% of what we hear is lies". I think that might be appropo. But certainly, if one is more comfortable with exact wave counts and fractals and the 5/34 MACD, then great.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Oh wow, that's nice of Dr. Williams...Yeah, I suppose everyone gets something different out of any book. His book was actually one of the first to get me thinking about getting away from If X, then Y "setups", so go figure.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
AvidTrader, is the 5SMA calculated from Close or Median?

Furthermore, how do you value BW compared to Renko methods?

Thanks and regards

Forex37

--- 帖子 #772 ---
I believe it is from the close (correct me someone if I am incorrect) and based of my limited knowledge of Renko I would say that BW's method will keep you in a trend longer.

I actually use candlesticks and they can give me additional confirmation of a signal I might take.  Where BW's might not get you in the beginning of a trend or possible exit, an harami candlestick might signal the end of one which I might short or go long at that point or exit and/or reverse if I'm in it.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Hey guys, I am using the gator for entries. I let the gator confirm direction, then place a stop order at the new high/low to enter the market. It works well on M30 EURUSD but I mis alot of trades because of my schedule. Has anyone seen or heard of a gator with an alert? If so can you post it or msg me with a link? Thanks all.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
BTW, does someone know how the "purple line" is called?

--- 帖子 #775 ---
It is a 5 simple displaced 3 moving average.

hi does any1 have an indicator to signal/mark the 1st wiseman signal? aka the divergent bar.

This is not clear to me: This "pink/purple" line has the very same properties as the "lips", just C instead of Median?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Why don`t you look through the list of attachments and check the chaos indicators?

Forex37

--- 帖子 #780 ---
thats the problem. standard chaos indicators only had AO AC gater fractals. only the 1st wiseman is missing.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
yes but i will advice u not to use it cus it repaint.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
ah found it. actually it doesnt repaint. once the bar closes, the code decides whether it fulfills the requirements of a div bar and then marks it. of cos there might be a few div bars before the prices actually reverse(n all of them will be marked) but it serves as a great signal to get ready to enter.

multiple div bars usually happen when i use them on 5-30mins TF. much better on 1hrs n more. mayb its cos BW likes to trade dailies n thus his methods are more for longer TFs

--- 帖子 #783 ---
1H Fractal breakout sell stop. Price below Aligator. AO below zero level.

hey man,,,it sound like u stop trading this system....bill williams is 1 of the wise man i ever read his book and very enlightened his system is a confirmation trend and very good to scalp with..i enjoy his system and if newbie can be patient to trade the fractal wave breakout with good MM u will have more winning, if u have good view of high and low prices then u wont have problem trading it..cheers Don

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hi Don

No, I'm still trading with more or less success. Just it seemed to me that everything has been said on this system...

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Once you make a buy/sell stop do you keep it until the price hits and activates it? Should you delete a stop before price hits it, if so when?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Once set - never delete it. Move only if price is moving in your direction. If price is against you stay still unless there is evidence that entry was an error and you want to leave trade.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi Avidtrader!

I find the purple line very interesting, never heard of it before.

But I don't understand, which Aligator settings you are using.

I see 10/16/26 for the three lines, which is incorrect. They should read 5/8/13.

Plus Williams don't base this on exponantial MA, but on the smoothed MA.

Please would you be so kind and clarify!

Greetings, alivef

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Thank you for the quick reply avidtrader!

I am following Bill Williams' aligator system since 2005, so I am always interested to hear new things about it.

There is one more thing I would like to ask:

I always hear, that the forex-market is not the right market for this system, and many people say, that it simply doesn't work.

Do you know anyone, who trades the aligator in Forex and is profitable with it on the long run?

If yes, what timeframe does BW recommend for Forex? I would believe, that anything below 1 hour timeframe is much to choppy for it.

Or: which pair does he recommend? very volatile ones, like GBPJPY oder slower ones, like AUDUSD oder USDCAD.

Thank you again in advance for your answer.

I am such a huge fan of this and would really like to test it on a live account, if there is any chance that it would really work!

kind regards,

alivef

--- 帖子 #791 ---
BW has traded the daily's with the currency market.  He recommended to me to use higher time frames.  I've used 4 hr and 2 hr time frames.  I like 2 hr time frames the best.  But when I am in front of the computer and trading, I like to use 15 min time frames for a 4-6 hour period.  Since I live in California its too late to trade the London market so that's where I'll put on trades using 2 hr time frames for overnight.  I am very consistent with what I have described.

BW's trading method is the best one I've seen and I find it strange that some say it doesn't work with the forex market.  I do not find that to be true at all.  His method works in any market.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi AvidTrader,

Here I've found something that you might wanted to know, when I opened the properties of the alligator. Its shows that the alligator was applied to median line with smooth MA. This alligator indicator come by default with metatrader software.

Hello,

Thanks for your posts. I am trying to learn the fractal breakout. I read your initial posts and went through the explanation on alpari. But, still don't understand it fully. What does it mean 'first fractal breakout' which is the first fractal? When we see the fractal arrow appearing, do we trade in the opposite direction. Please clarify.

thanks

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hello,

Here's a chart. Please have a look and let me know if it is a bit more clear for you....

You have to wait for the alligator to go to sleep, then, you are looking for a fractal forming above/below the red line. then, you are in !

I hope this help !

I know after reading the balance of your threads here Isto that you seem to have covered everything. I am just a little dense I think. I have traded for a year and consistently lost money from a 20k account. in December I "got" it somewhat and since have gained back the 7k loss and made several thousand over my initial investment.

In looking at the indicators I am still puzzled at the role the wisemen play.. I have Trading Chaos 2nd otw from Amazon but need a little more "real world" how they are used.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
u can only understand after reading the book and seeing the partterns forming on ur chart till then everything abt wiseman signals will be new to u..this method is not for retracement it rather base on breakout and momentum trading in counter trend..buy above and sell below alligator mouth required patient and fractal wave breakout...

--- 帖子 #799 ---
I would assume also that one should stick to trade going in the direction of the longer timframe trends?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
hi Paddy

First things - first.

Never ever trade system on a live account unless you're pretty sure what are you doing! Period.

Whatever system you choose you must understand it - how and why it works as it works. This requires lot's of reading, thinking and experimenting.

All explanations on the world won't replace your homework.

As I said above: If you have questions - ask.

The chart that you posted is actually a daily not an hourly chart.

I ran a daily chart and an hourly chart through my El Wave software and they came out with similar counts.  The daily one is attached.

I would prospect in a different pair for a better setup, but you could catch that little fifth wave down.  The CAD is strong at this point and the pound is weak.

Elwave is an excellent program.  I have used it since it was first available and they just keep making it better.

I don't know if I am allowed to post a URL here, but Google Elwave and  Prognosis and you will find their site.

You can connect it to mt4 and have it count waves in real time as the prices arrive.

Bill Williams methods do not really require that intense degree of analysis though.  If you follow his strategy and stay out of short-term charts you will be fine.  Remember if you cannot see a good opportunity in a a pair, try another pair, opportunity is always knocking somewhere.

I am out of town for a week but I will start trying to post some good looking chart counts here when I get a chance.

I appreciate it Wab. I figure, from the analysis so far, that Chaos rules. Would you advise going to visit Bill and his Daughter for the class they give?

I have played with the Elwave demo some and read the website at prognosis. Would purchasing Elwave be worth the investment?

Thank you WAB

pmacbrian..........by all means I would suggest to go.  I've used his home study course for 12 years and bought the updated one in 2007. I then went to the private tutorial with Bill and Justine in March of 2008.  Well worth it and Bill is just a great guy!

I've been trading using his Trading Chaos second edition book.  (I've been trading with the first edition system, which is GREAT!) and I have to say I am SORELY disappointed in the "Wise Men" and the new oscillators.  But my main beef is with what is arguably the cornerstone of the new system, that which decides the bulk of your entries. The first "wise man", the Bullish Divergence Bar.

I would seriously warn people against trading the bullish divergence bar.  Using the Alligator and good angulation doesn't seem to help in the slightest; for every cherry picked trade you win, you get stopped out (with big SLs even H1 and H4) five to ten times.  I've practiced using this tech on H1, H4, and 15M Tfs.   In my final analysis the BDB is a dangerous counter trend technique, and is quite hazardous to the health of any account using it.  Frankly it is not working live at all thus far for me.  Whereas Trading Chaos first edition does work, often and well.

If you really must pick tops and bottoms; pin bars on the H1 and H4 are a MUCH safer tried and true method, pin bars with pivots and fibs being even more profitable.   In fact the only time the bullish divergence bar has worked for me has been in the presence of a good pin bar.  The problem with the BDB is that with angulation you end up placing your stop well before a pin bar forms.  And then even if it does, you usually hadn't gained anymore profit than if you had waited for a pin bar to form and close and then price action.

Basically angulation is just pin bar trading, but good angulation (by the rules of the system) forms often without pin bars and this is where trading it fails, might as well just trade the pins.

Where you lose big money is if you place your buy or sell stop a couple pips above or below the BDB, you frequently get your stop gently "tapped" by a pin and then the market can continue trending.  Conversly if you place your stops too far away from the BDB it is nearly impossible to break even, if the market continues trending.  And profits are generally lower IF the BDB is even true.

I am quite confused why Bill Williams shoehorned the BDB into his system and turned his system indicators that were built around trading with the trend, into indicators to trade against it.  The exact process of picking out a BDB and putting a stop on it requires trading against an Alligator that is in the process of closing.  So really this technique works against the purpose of the Alligator as well.

I am in the process of back testing bullish div bars but as I am also taking price action based off the MFI into account this is taking me some time, finding a lot of losers so far though.

As for me, I am going to stick with my MFI, 5/34/5 MACD, Fractals, and EWs, using the Profitunity indicators as they were originally intended, as a trend spotting and trading system, not this ultra counter trend bottom and top picking stuff that does not pan out often enough to have profitable system expectancy.

Has anyone else had issues with this? Any tips? I'm seriously disappointed right now after being so excited over the "brand new indicators" and "revised system" a while ago when I pored over and digested Trading Chaos second edition.  This system just does not trade as well as its examples, even when you are being ultra conservative following the rules.

And don't even get me started about adding lots based on the AO.  Or the part in the book on page 126 where he suggests you could even in theory trade off the first signal bar from the AO and be highly profitable.  If you did, you'd wipe out an account in short order.  Don't believe me, back test it on any currency pair.  I'm starting to see why the second edition was 3/4ths filled with psychobabble.  The second edition system is weak sauce IMO.

Nevermind the AO, if you just traded squat to squat on the MFI you would be profitable, and wouldn't be getting big SL hits either.

But like I said, I didn't just post this only to vent my indignity at the second edition of Trading Chaos, but also to see if people who use the first edition system have actually incorporated the second well into their trading.  So please do, take my points and tell me if you agree or disagree with them.    I'm subbed to this thread and have seen good live trades using this system.  Apparently it is possible...

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Great post. Thank you for this. I like it because the thread shows that BW´s approach works BUT.... Not just that " it does not work..." or "it is the Holy Grail" but a very long post wth a detailled opinion.

I have some problems with my stops too. The WM1 and WM2 gets me in early but you get several losses and one winner. And the stoploss has to be huge. Too much for me. But since I started trading more along the Elliott waves, it gets better and I do not get so many loosers anymore. But I started thinking too if I really need those Wm 1 and 2. The approach in Trading Dimensions fits me much more. But I am really fascinated with the MFI and Volume. Could you post some charts to show your approach? Would be great.

Does anyone have an ea or indicator that sounds an alarm when a fractal breakout occurs?

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Being newer to Forex, and liking the Williams approach I also have not had success with the Wise 1. Seems that you need to place that entry very small because you will most likely Stop out. W2 seems to be a little better, but not much and fractals... well there has to be more understanding on my part. I see the potential just not the profits ...yet. Would be nice to work out the details a little bit more with others on this Thread.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Have a look at the EWaves too. It might help. A WM1 in a corrective wave might   be a winner if you know where you are with the Elliott Waves.

I too have struggled with the Wisman 1 signals. In fact I have removed it from my charts and gone back to the "New Trading Dimensions" style of trading. The problem I am having now is that saddle points are becoming rarer. It used to be I could find 5-8 daily chart trades a month. Now its down to 1-2. I really think the markets are still messed up since the collapse of 08.  I think it will take more time for them to get back to normal. Used to be I could find a few Wisman 1's with maybe 1 out of 3 working. Now its 1 out of ten with Wiseman 1's showing up constantly. 09 was a horrible year for trading in the futures market, with most contracts correcting the long term sell off from 08. It made for some terrible volatility. AUD/USD and CAD/USD are showing that volatility now. Wheat was a good example the other day, 10% down in a matter of hours only to retrace a good portion in the july contract. I am also watching liquidity dissappear in some markets. Not to be negative but I think there is a big change going on in the markets. It may take a while to make it to the other side. Someday things will be normal again!

i dunno whats happening to the markets these days but it's really chaos ...

btw nice setups.. very easy profit making

--- 帖子 #830 ---
I just finished watching the home study videos.  They were great until I started looking over my live charts.  I'm convinced there must be something missing...if you trade this 'system' you will get slaughtered on all the losing WM1 signals.

I'm thinking that the way to compensate for the losing WM1 signals is to employ some kind of stop and reverse strategy.  Perhaps increasing lot size to get back to BE faster.  Any opinions?

Also, while some in the forum suggest to forget the WM1 and WM2 signals, that is the basis of their 'system'.  BW's approach is not 1 entry and 1 exit but to employ a trading campaign.  If you eliminate 2 entries then the concept of the trading campaign is not being used as they teach it.

I've spent hrs looking at charts of all time frames and I don't see how to prevent getting whip sawed by chop (aka the sleeping alligator).

I don't believe these observations are limited to FX.  I looked at gold, oil, e-mini's, etc... on different time frames and all markets exhibit the same 'problem'.

What am I missing?

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Experience and practice

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Read the first edition Trading Chaos, incorporate the Alligator as it is a powerful trend following tool, or you can choose to use the old system, 34 5, and 13 EMAs.  Which are almost the Alligator but not as speculative.

The problem is, Trading Chaos, and New Trading Dimensions = Powerful trend following systems.  Using all the old indis, the MFI, Fractals, Thumb trades, very profitable.

Starting at Trading Chaos 2nd Edition, the first "wise man" who isn't all that wise unless you enjoy hitting wide stops on a live account, turns the system on its head into a Counter Trend system.  Which entails larger and more inherent risk.

I trade the old system, and it is still profitable to this day, many of the new indicators, the AO, the AC, are just the shifted old indicators, fractals are enough to get in early enough on a move, to not have to risk a ridiculous stop IMO, on any time frame.  If it touches your stop, get ready for potential disaster.  In a range, or too far away, you better watch that trade, you might only get 5 pips.

I don't know exactly why Bill Williams added the divergent bar, my guess is he actually didn't, but his daughter or some other influential trader added it to the system.  That opinion is entirely speculative, but the BDB stands out as a sore thumb in what is a trend following system.  Some people use it profitably, some in Bill's trading group, I know many more it does not work for.  As a tool it really seems to break down on the higher time frames.  I don't know why, the Profitunity system is a real charm without trying to pick tops and bottoms.

And again, if you want to learn how to try to pick tops and bottoms, you can read the first book and learn very deeply about the structure of the Elliot Wave.  Become an Elliotician to pick tops and bottoms, but beware, until you have a great deal of experience you will have to relabel.  I would practice practice practice until the waves scream out at you.  And when they don't, when you are forcing labels, simply don't trade.

Hope this helps, I really am a fan of this system, hell a practitioner of it, as it was the first system I really buckled down to study and learn its ins and outs.  The First Wise man, is just not a good setup.  Rather, go back to the first book and use thumb trades with MFI.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Thanks for the feedback.  I find that most traders are more focused on the 'setup' as compared with the money management.  As I said in my original post their course emphasizes the notion of a trading campaign.  Adding to your trade 3-4 times as signals continue to present themselves.

Are people doing this?  What's the implication if you choose not to trade the WM1 and WM2 signals?

Also, as far as the alligator goes, I'm using the built-in MT4 indi with the default settings.  That is what is in the Profitunity course.  Are you suggesting I change it?

You Elliotician comments are interesting...as they are EXACTLY opposite of what Justine says in the program.  They have really de-emphasized the E Wave...though they do acknowledge the benefits.  I can understand how it could be helpful.  Do you have any suggestions for learning this?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
That's it!

You mean to tell me that you are successful trading the Profitunity program as described in the class and you have no other suggestions other then experience and practice?

Please elaborate.  I think your insights will be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Depending on your interpretation of wm1 it may not actually be a valid signal if it below the red line on a long and above it on a short.  It is used in conjunction with a bdb in the "gambling stage of Bill's method.  I am having more success and more consistancy with using wm3's only.  Usually taking a wm3 is clearing past a wave 5 on some lower time frame.  I use tight stops as well once it clears my entry point after say bar 2.  If it continues my way great if not I get stopped out with a 1 pip gain. At that point I look for a new entry point.  What I have found that is working well is looking for 3 valid fractals below or above the red line.  I take the fractal with the best price entry and it does not matter what time frame you use.

Bill is big on BDB's but I have had more losses than wins using them.  If I do use one I again use a tight stop if it moves in my direction and then reverses.  I have also waited for the 2nd bar to enter as many times I will get executed on a bdb but immediately reverses for a loss.

I would suggest at this point to just focus on 3 valid fractals to form first and then take the first one that hits.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Avid, thanks for the 3 fractal suggestion.  I've looked at similar approaches but it seems that by the time the 3rd fractal is put in we are far into the trend.  Would it be to much to ask if you could post a chart example?

What timeframe do you trade and what times (GMT) do you trade?  I'm US Eastern time...I keep thinking that London open may be the time to trade forex as that is when most (if not all) of the daily range is put in.

Lastly, have you considered using a stop-and-reverse strategy with the WM1?  It seems if the market is not ready to reverse then it is more likely to continue.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Here is an example of what I am talking about.  As you can see there are 3 valid fractals above the red line.  I have had much success taking the 3rd valid fractal above the red line or below if it is a short.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
The 3 fractal setup he is refering to is basically a "saddle point" from Bill's book "New Trading Dimensions". They work very well but are few and far between these days at the daily level. Markets are just too volitale to let them setup.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I emphatically agree with you on this method, if I was going to use Trading Chaos 2nd edition, this is exactly the way I would do it.  I prefer the first however, as it works for me.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
I don't see why you would want to de-emphasize the Elliott wave, as the point of and axiom behind every indicator Bill Williams uses and has developed is based on what he calls the "fractal underlying structure" of markets, which he identifies as an Elliott Wave.   More on this later, however.

Basically everything Bill Williams developed, with the exception of the BDB (Makes sense why it doesn't work as well as everything else now, actually) is based on E Wave theory.  Bill Williams is a prominent Elliottician, and quite skilled.

Returning to the de-emphasis of the Elliot Wave:

I do believe that they streamlined the system in New Trading Dimensions and especially Trading Chaos 2nd edition to take the "lumps" out of having to actually spend a lot of time learning how to trade waves.  There's nothing wrong with this, as really the indicators still pretty much work (not as well as the first edition plain ones in my experience)...But they are based upon Bill's understanding of the structure of the EWave.

Suggestions for learning the Wave, well you could get ElWave software, practice labeling and then run the software to see where you differ with the software, as it pretty accurate.  It is quite expensive software however.  Book wise I recommend two, The Frost and Prechter one and Mastering Elliott Wave by Glenn Neely, I am studying it right now and it offers practical methods for identifying where you are at in a wave using a confluence of multiple time frames  and then labeling correctly.  It takes quite a bit of practice and study however.

Personally, I tend to spot waves easiest using the 15m TF and then the 4H TF.  Anything below 15m and the 1H I am not too great at.  I don't trade only waves though, I make much use of daily pivots for my entries as well, if a currency is near a pivot point, or S&R when I am trading.

There is a lot of controversy regarding whether EWaves work, or are too subjective, but really everything is subjective.  If you understand the intricacies of a system and apply its rules well, and have a good deal of experience as an air bag on top of that; you will have more winners than losers.  I trade Chaos with EURUSD and GBPUSD, when I trade GBPJPY and JPY pairs I only use PPs and Ichimoku, I do all right using two completely different systems, but I make sure to study them as I would any other subject, and then follow them.   Really everything comes down to knowing your system, trading it correctly, money management and experience.  As everyone says, there is no silver bullet.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Oh, I agree,  I mainly use them on 2, 5, and 15 min tf's.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
ScalpOrDie......do you only trade daily's?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Thanks for showing the chart....would an entry at the break of C be valid?  If so, how would you manage the trade?

--- 帖子 #844 ---
That would be a valid trade.  The exit would have been the top of the bar below the #1 bar according to Bill's rules but I personally would have place a stop 1 pip below my entry after a couple of down bars.  I play things very tight and since I like using 2 minute time frames I get a lot of fractal trades.  I also use BDB's to get back in trades as well.

Hi, I'm reading New Trading Dimensions now and just wanted to know how Bill Williams' method is working for you guys. Has anyone seen an EA for this? From what I've read so far it looks like it's a mechanical trading system with no interpretations needed, so I'll definitely write an EA for this once I finish reading the book.

EDIT: I only found one EA for this one mql code base, but it appears to be using wrong indicators and MAs.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
FWIW- I know of one commercial EA that was written based on this system- the drawback was getting that one "account killer" stuck on a top or bottom... It's too bad because the results can be "amazing".  It's probably best just to start an EA from scratch and use the 4hr high/low for SL.

What would be cool -- the farther from the High/Low. have the EA change the lot size the same risk- instead of using a fixed size. that way 20 pip Sl would risk the same amount in your account as a 150pip SL

--- 帖子 #851 ---
What do you mean by that?

--- 帖子 #852 ---
It had NO SL...so when the major trend changed- the DD would be catastrophic.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Let's keep the thread alive! Bill Williams claims on average traders get 10% per month with this strategy... That would make me millionaire within 5 years, how awesome is that...

Anyway here's an indicator I made that indicates the zone you're in (above the price bars)

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Thanks Jasus, so the toolbox is getting filled.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Here is another useful BW indicator - a multiple time frame AO.

Add it as many times as you want to the bottom of your chart then set each copy to the time frame of your choice.  it enables you to tell what the AO is doing in other time frames with just a glance. When all of those higher time frames all have AOs that are green or red, it pretty much helps you make decisions.

I have mine respectively set to M15, M30, M60, M240 and D1.  It is handy tool for prospecting through a series of of pairs to determine which ones are of merit.

Now if someone could write and alarm that sounds when all the MTFAO are the same color....  Or maybe display them in the upper right hand corner of a screen like the signal bars indicator does...  that would be very handy.

I have also attached signal bars for anyone/everyone to look at.  I have set the MACD in my siganl bars to 5,34 5 in a reasonable attempt to get the MTF AO replicated.

As for other indicators, has anyone tried using the Laguerres (Lags) as explained by Imram Sait on FF?

There is a good measure of correlation between the AO and the Lags that we might explore.

Chaos is pretty good as it is but we should always push the envelope.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
I'd rather not modify the system at all. Bill Williams says one reason why most traders who fail using his system is because they simply don't follow the rules.

I've been making some tests and it's crazy how much you profit from a single trend... on one trend I made 16 add-ons and only 4 of these were unprofitable. Result: a 750 pips trend gave me 7055 pips. On a exceptionally crazy uptrend of 6200 pips I didn't only get 6200 pips, I got 32.700 pips... So why would you modify this system, right ?

This trading system is just sick, I never got so excited about a trading system

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Hi Jasus,

can you please advise in which time frame you trade ? and how you enter the trade mostly ?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #858 ---
You have to read the book "New Trading Dimensions" by Bill Williams to understand the system. Here there is also information, but there are some minor missing parts which may be crucial.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
- For Chaos traders I programmed a little indicator (smChaos TrendModeAll) to get signals if the Alligator lines harmonize, and the colours of the AO&AC indicators match. (You can check this in chart1).

- The second posted indicator ( smPA_PriceRetracement_v1) draws retracement lines, and can be also used for other systems... (chart2)

- If you combine the Chaos signals with Support&Resistance lines, maybe can you find useful setups (chart3).

I just having a test with Fractal breakout trading and with alligator lines. So far the trade on recent situation provide good pips and nice result.

but I have questions:

1. when the market have no trend (sideways) should we waiting the market till they have the trend to open position ?

2. with alligator indicators / oscillators ... how to know whether the price already overbought or oversold ... did you guys using stoch or just using gator/ao/ac ?

I prefer longer time frames because I have a life beyond sitting on the monitor.  I like trading shorter time frames ...BW stuff works even on M5 but the time required to sit and watch is a no go for me.

As for profitable.  Last week I caught the drop in the Euro, not a strict BW entry but a nice drop to the 38% level that was right on after an AO divergence.

usually i use daily and 4 hour to look the overall trend.. and enter based on hourly chart, look at 15 min chart to see the end of wave count on hourly chart. well i learn a lot reading tax geek post, anyway where is he now? long time no see his posting...

yeahhh the drop in the euro and gbp as well, 4 hour chart and hourly chart ao divergence, end of a trend and also break the trend line. but still hard for me to stay in a trend

--- 帖子 #870 ---
1. No, you don't! Bill Williams says you have to see when the alligator lines are interwining for some time (alligator sleeping) and place orders above/below the fractals. If you wait until there's a trend, you'll get it on the middle or end, and with the add-ons you will be doing you'll lose a lot.

2. Bill Williams says overbought/oversold levels don't exist, so don't even worry about that.

With all the add-ons you have to do following the original Bill Williams strategy... Unless you have a special account with very low spreads I don't see anything else than daily/weekly being profitable, maybe 4 hours too. But you have to follow it bar by bar, so unless you want to look at the monitor every 4 hours for the whole day, just trade daily or trade non 24h markets.

I already tested EUR/AUD from 01/01/2001 to november of 2007 on daily, assuming a spread of 3 pips.

The results were a total profit of 13400 pips during 7 years and an average profit per month of 159 pips. However I ignored the massive win of 7000 pips on a trade, to play it safe (I don't want a strategy to win depending on a single move).

Maximum drawdown = 3600 pips
Average profit/average loss (reward to risk ) = didn't calculate it, but it's good. Maybe 3:1

With diversification (for the same amount invested) the risk decreases and the total profit increases. I'm going to finish testing EUR/AUD and start on other pairs, I'm gonna keep updating

--- 帖子 #873 ---
hi Jasus,

may I know your entry exit strategy using fractal ? Did you do swing or scalping using fractal ?

if possible, may I see your entry exit strategy on chart .... please

I got a problem with the exit strategy at the moment ... sometimes I got profit by fractal break out but the target prices are not meet so it bounce back and touching the sell fractal which mean my long position closed by stop loss n it ignited new sell/short position .. and then it bounce back (like Euro-Usd today)

here is my chart ... I lost a lot of money in this market because I got whipsaw both buy and sell positions are touched and my stop loss weretriggered as well

Good day all, I just wanted to chime in and say that i to used the BW indicators. The indicaotrs have been converted from MT to the Ninjatrader forum. So after 1.5 years of shadowtraders and every other damn thing not to mention crappy resluts, now this. Im pleased to announce great resluts. Just to be honest as possible, my trades are still sim but plan live trading monday morning. Here is what im looking at on the 6E. Basically scalping is what I prefer. What makes a good entry would be the ac, ao on a three min chart positive or negitive (both matching) Then look for the 1 min chart to product the same thing. Once the Elliott Oscillator diverges, you are in for 3-9 tics. Still have to determined what the fractals do???

Is this euro wave count correct??

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Here is my hourly count for the Euro.  Maybe it will help?

Check the count against the AO to see if it is correct when ever you can.  The very last label II is one I am not comfortable with.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Unfortunately, I dont know what the count on Ao is. I just ordered the BW books from amazon... this should help.

Whats most surprising, is that the BW system is not covered in the Ninjatrader site  like it is here.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
anyway .. i would like to know how to put Stop Loss and Exit / Taking profit strategy using this Chaos system...

I did fractal and the result is good but I have trouble with the SL and TP at the moment.

and could the alligator detect whether the market having whipsaw or not (when to stay away from the market)

like today in Euro USD we got so many false signal

--- 帖子 #883 ---
You are familiar with the COMPLETE system? I can`t confirm "many false signals"

Forex37

--- 帖子 #884 ---
guess you're in wave 4, try reading trading chaos 1st ed on the elliot wave section,it's really helpful.

on timeframe did you trade the euro?

for stop loss i like using one tick above the highest from 5 previous bar and one tick below the lowest previous 5 bar low when buy. Same when i'm taking profit... or if you think the price is moving too fast and too far away from the alligator, better take the profit... this work for me...

--- 帖子 #885 ---
ok thank you ... just got that book yesterday and still reading it.

I use H1 for entry (using fractal or AO) and on TF 15M to get out the market.

so far using fractal and AO still produce good results. but still have problem with exit too soon or too late lol ...

--- 帖子 #886 ---
for the fractal, which timeframe did you used ?

sometimes we just break the fractal but after that it bounce back inside the fractal (not as sweet as we saw in the book)

I put buy/ sell 3-4 pips above/bellow the fractal. but the prices seems to bounce back ... I am using h1 and sometimes h4 fractal.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
If you have the correct fractal, you can try and entry 0.618 to 0.768 back for the fractal that you plan to enter from but you are best using the system as it is int eh book until you understand it better.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
anyway .. which book I should get :

1. trading chaos 2nd edition

or

2. new trading dimensions  ?

I have the trading chaos 1st edition but it didn't go deep with 5 dimensions. in trading chaos 2nd ed someone told me that they give more than 5 dimensions right ?

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Trading Chaos is all you really need to get going, if you don't understand it and try the ideas out then the second and third books won't help you.  You need to master the ideas in Trading Chaos first -  in my opinion anyway.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
i recommend trading chaos 1st edition, and read only the Elliot wave section and then you can use what in the 2nd edition at the end of a wave.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
asking about ao

http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/9882/askaoff.png

the AO give signal buy if the price move up the green candle. but the trend is bearish and the price is still inside alligator mouth. should I put buy stop on that position ?

--- 帖子 #892 ---
The 2nd edition is all you need.Price is inside the mouth while the twin peak signals the action.would you do anything near the alligator mouth? It can bite you there.So be careful.Wait for a better signal, such as when price is above or below the mouth, then if any other signal generated, then only you act the trade.

There is no need to use the gator indicator.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
no buy

Hi

I believe that Bill Williams has got the structure of the market right. I love this system. However being a believer in simplicity my approach is a bit simpler. Here is what I did this morning using Alligator and my MACD that IMO does better job then AO. The shaded are is my indicator that i call AIMS Levels. I only trade on the break of AIMS Levels which ever side the alligator opens its mouth.

when the aligator got tired the greens in the AO stopped showing and a new trend of reds arose,he fell into sleep,then in the gator i saw that the aligator was waking up so i closed ,good decision since it went up,the aligator got filled up with all the pips he ate,and went back to sleep again ,and there goes another day of the bill williamse's alligator

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Nice chart Yousafzi.

Would you mind sharing the indicators and explaining the AIMS idea a bit?

I use a traditional 5 34 5 macd as well as Elliott wave software (ElWave.)  Pretty hard to do any better than Bill Williams ideas.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Hi Wab!

AIMS is my indicator instead of Fractals. I dont like the up and down arrows. Plus I dont want to trade within this zone. I like the price to be out of the AIMS Levels. AIMS is based on BW's Fractal. I take trades above/below the first Fractal out of the Alligators mouth when it sleeps or dozes off. SL on the other side of AIMS. Unfortunately I cannot share the MACD because that does not belong to me and is a part of another software although I can share ex4 for AIMS.

btw I dont think Chaos can be spotted with linear machines but just out of interest would love to know how good is the ElWave in your opinion?

cheers

--- 帖子 #898 ---
in my systems i use (dbfx)stoshastic ,and volume +on mt4 platform i use the bill williams template and those 2 fit right in ,they are pretty good

--- 帖子 #899 ---
One of the drawbacks of MT4 is the linear scaled charts. ElWave can do both linear and semi-log analysis, so we will see how that goes.  It can also be plugged into some FX feeds and do live EW counts in any time frame.  I tried that for a while, but I prefer longer term charts and  having minute by minute stuff happening was not suitable for me.

I run ElWave and simultaneously independently do my wave count using the BW method with the 5 34 5 MACD or the AO.  Then I compare my BW count to the selected ElWave one.  If they agree, then I feel confident  that I am on the right track.  If they do not agree, then I start to check back and forth in the alternative ElWave counts until the BW method agrees with one of the counts or I stay out if I can't find a verified solution.

ElWave is purely mathematical and gives you the possible wave counts in ranked order of how each fits all the rules.  It provides an unemotional, rational, logical, mathematical count of the preferred wave structure and ranks the alternatives based on how well they fit the rules.

I look for higher time frame counts that I think are very good, then I try to trade the wave structure inside a suitable wave on a lower time frame.

Anyhow, stay tuned, will start an Elwave thread as soon as I get some other stuff done.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
HI,

Very interesting stuff you have here. Thanks for the info. I'm curious though; what's the difference between the 5 34 5 MACD and BW's AO indicator? I thought they were the same thing.

BTW, the ElWave, does that work with Metatrader?

Thanks

RD

--- 帖子 #901 ---
The original 3, 35, 5 MACD was used to count waves in earlier Elliott Wave Software called Advanced GET.  It is just a simple average MACD.

The AO uses a 5, 34, 5 simple average MACD of the (H-L)/2  an average of the midpoint or median price of each bar.  The Alligator moving averages are also based on the Median price.

I use the AO and AC and I also like to look at the traditional 5, 34, 5 MACD.

I have just started a new thread using ELWAVE called  ELWAVE BW Forex.  I hope to post useful material there for anyone who would like to discuss ELWave and Elliot. Drop in and visit.

Hi

Some days earlier I posted my trades on m1 using my AIMS indicator along with STMACD and Alligator. After 6months of deliberation I have finally stoped using the STMACD and started trusting the AO. (baggage of previous systems i guess). But I do know how to work with my STMACD i call it St. McD (pronounced: Saint Mac-Dee  ). However I have found that my macd is based on EMA's hence not smooth. anyway here is my morning campaign on EU. Also took GU alongside. closed for +35. Closed two positions on EU for +60 +60. Earlier had a good run on EU and GU at Frankfurt open. sitting at +180 for the day. and I might trade the NY session today. (as wee speak GU 11.07 UK, i'm short GU from 1.5777 SL moved to 1.5750 that is around 26pips locked.

Kind Regards

ps: reason for two trades is because i trade on M5 and M1. It was a setup on M1 (earlier eantry) and a setup on M5.

I thought I'll share one more BW Profitunity Trade before I disappear into thin air for good!

I changed code for my AIMS MACD and turned it into AIMS AO. Works fine.

Hi Yousafzai,

Nice chart setup. Will you share your AIMS AO?

Why are you "disappearing" for good? Are you still trading "the dogs"?

Hope to still see you on FF - always enjoy your posts. All the best.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Hey Hermit!

good to hear from you. No i'm not disappearing just as yet (reading other posts around forums, I understand that it could be nasty place to socialize, at times, u know what i mean  ). Today was another great day for this. And yes Still trading the Dogs its not very different from this but of course the owner (Dave) totally rejects EW which I find a bit strange. problem with the Dogs is that it does not setup for the 5th wave. Hence to catch 5 wave u gotta drop down to m1 (if trading m5) and catch third wave on there. The LTMACD is good and bad at the same time. The usuall lagging nature of MA and MACD's prevail

Here is how my GU campaign ended today.

a/c is up more then 15%.

I'm novice to his system but not to systematic trading as i've been doing this for two years now. I've read BW's books and I'm drawn to the theory as it seems sound and compelling but i'm wondering where it could fail. Is it just an issue with following the system or does it have to be tweaked in order to uleash it full potential? One thing that i'm slightly perplexed by is the AO definition, which is a moving average based indicator based on the same lookback period for all markets and timeframes; am i wrong in thinking this or are there potential pitfalls?

--- 帖子 #921 ---
In this world noting work best all the time so u will not be wonderin why BW system fail cus noting is perfect. Don't worry if it fail u sometime but if u can grow ur acc consistency.  Demo it and master it, you will find the result before u put real cash in.

in an interview, Bill said to use it at the end of a complete 5 wave, make sure the 5 magic bullets presence..

--- 帖子 #926 ---
YEs I do. But as the other member mentioned quite correctly, it has to be when you have reason to believe t hat is "grounded" assessment that the trend could be finishing and ready for reversal. That you can do by looking for 5 Magic Bullets and then spotting the Bullish/Bearish Divergent bar. It is more an art. I focus mainly on the Saddlepoint/ sleepy Alligator situation. For that I trade the lowest fastest possible time frame. Its like I zoom into the corners of Mandelbrot's Bug!

I hope it helps.

The following campaign started last night and left to mature over night. I slept well. Woke up quite energetic, I had no analysis to do. I know my three buddies will be there for me. AIMS, AO and Prof. LE Gator.  They helped me add on a few more postions before I exited before news time. Though news did not do much damage, it was wise to run away. !

a couple of candle later on m15 i exited which turned out to be the perfect exit for that time frame. a couple of runners are still there. But since it bounced against upper aims level on h4 chart, i might be closing them soon.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
I am learning and enjoying this discussion. Since BW's 5 magic bullets have been mentioned, I am wondering what you active guys are using to identify a squat bar in Forex, or if you are even using it. It is generally taught that volume is irrelevant in Forex trading, but I think it would be helpful if it could be used.

Please dont get me wrong, your question itself raises a couple of questions.

Do you know how to form a fractal? if yes you'd be able to know exactly when a possible fractal would appear?

If no,

then Have you read BW's Book/s?

if yes, then you should know what fractal is

if no, then you should definitely, definitely read the book.

When the alligator on M5 opens add on on every fractal until either the AO peaks or if you have enough patience and stronger belief system, wait for divergence possibly get more out of it.

But also depends on your belief system, your patience levels and understanding of the structure of the market. e.g if you are short maximum lots and price moves considerably, (to know what is considerably requires experience and understanding of chaos IMO...) and have enough pips in total do you bank profits or play the game a bit more? its freedom beyond that point. IMHO.

This is my Last Post. Good Bye.

ps: to everyone, it can be done and you can do it too. Jut give it a try.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
I have been working BW theory on and off over the last year +, usually with my own spin.   Your comment on alligator opening finally struck a chord on what I have been missing with it.  Other than filtering fractals with red line, the alligator hasn't done anything else for me.   Thank you for the simple insight.   I remember now how much BW put into the alligator and how little weight I have been giving it compared to other components of chaos.

Do you also drop to 1min to build your position based on the 5min or do you trade each time frame independently using the wave structure on the AO of each TF.

Consistent pips to everyone here.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
I too appreciate his comments regarding the alligator.  I bought the home study course three months ago and have yet to start live trading.  That said, I'm bad about giving greater weighting mentally to the fractals and ignoring the AO and Alligator.

They work in harmony with each other and they are telling a story to you but you've got to get your presuppositions right before you can hear that story.  So much more to learn.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
+1000   There is such a delicate balance between all of the pieces of this system, it is truly amazing to see it unfold in front of your eyes when you get the right "recipe". It may be slightly different for each one of us, but its there within the system. I have been using this method since "New Trading Dimensions" and can say that I have made more profits with Bill's methods than with anything else. 625% this year so far trading futures. From my early work with Bill and Justine, I know that it takes a good 6-12 months to fully grasp whats going on, and for me it took an additional year to really start putting up big numbers. As long as you are not losing money in the beginning, you are on the right track and profits will come.

Good trading to all!

--- 帖子 #946 ---
So far, I'm 50/50 win/loss ratio and slightly profitable. I've got big problems with fear because I drew down 40% of my account value BEFORE I bought the course. The holy grail is wanting what the market wants and if you're afraid, you don't want what it wants you just want out of it. So, I've got that to overcome.

One thing that I'm convinced of. Fractals are natures support and resistance lines and they represent a higher order to the natural process which is a financial market. If you can get in tune with that process it's a nice ride indeed.

Let me ask you a question. I'm going to trade mini lots on forex to start my live trading. I can live with $1 per pip drawdowns. Do you think that's the wise thing to do until my confidence is built back up? I tried trading emini S&Ps but can't stand a $300 loss right now. I'm just to gun shy.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
earret: Only end of day. Requires huge amounts of patience to wait for the perfect setup during the corrective periods. I dont use wisman #1, I could never make it work for my personality.

Alligator: There's no secret, its just what works for my personality. Thats why I believe them when they say the system cannot be exploited, everybody trades it a little differently. I spend a lot of time looking at charts and my style has emerged from that.

crghill: I dont know anything about forex, but if I were you I would trade at a level where the typical loss per trade doesn't effect you mentally, ie small. You will be suprized that you can still make decent money trading small. What I had to do, which is a bit contrary to their recommendations, is quantify my risk per trade based roughly on the green line, before I enter any trade. That way I know my risk(1-3% per trade of account balance). I don't take trades where the risk is too high emotionally for me. That in turn forces patience. What I am working on now is to let my profits run a bit more. The big money is made in the 1-3 extended trends that happen in any given year. Take a look at cotton for an example. If you can catch just one of those, you can earn your whole year. I tend to set profit targets based on Fib and Ewave so that has limited my gains. The trick is to know which trade has that potential. It seems to me that failed 4th transitioning to 5th waves tend to do this, look at sugar off its lows this year.

Hope that helps

It helps a bunch.  I like to take fractals that are close to the green line.  It limits risk and helps me sleep.  If I get in a fast moving market, I see entries that are to far away from the exit and I just can't take them yet.  I've been paper trading forex this morning and at most had $265 out on margin.  I've made $28.15 just playing micros and minis.  That's over 10% in about 45 minutes time.  No, it's not real money but it sure is a confidence builder.

Take a look at the Euro chart, its plain as day. Using either of their methods your going to make money, there is no secret. The best advice I can give is buy all three books. Treat them as your second religion, I do. My wife calls them my bibles. If you can afford it, buy the home study course. If you can afford it, go to a seminar. I have done all and it was well worth it. (Full disclosure, since taking the seminar years ago, Bill and I have become friends, I email with him on occasion). As far as how to do it or what way to get in and out, I am a nervous nelly. I hate volatility, so I wait for alligators that are in coma's. Others make more money trading chaos style. Its all up to the person. I have taken bits and pieces of both styles and fit them togther for me. I can tell you that my wins average 7-15 times my losses and I am not sure what my hit rate is, although the less I trade the higher it goes.

One final comment: I am kind of amazed when folks take bits and pieces of a system on a chat board and trade it. The books are 20 bucks!

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Hi Richard, not a lot to be truthful. In fact it messed me up for a little bit trying to incorporate the Wisman 1, but thats just me, I still recommend reading it. I use Wiseman 2 and 3 in my trading. My feeling was that trading chaos 2 was a reaction to the chaos( no pun intended) after the top in 2000 through 2002. 2009 was similar, I think, but have not back tested, that wiseman style (counter trend) way out performed using tight stops in 2009. Right now, and for that matter most of 2010, it looks kind of trendy to me. One of Bill's assistants used to write an ewave newsletter for seminar participants. The last issue he wrote in mid 08 he was calling for wave 4 retracements on the monthly level. It looks to me as if those corrections may have ended starting at the beginning of this year so hopefully the trendiness will continue. Sadly, he no longer writes the newsletter.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
yeahh, i'm having trouble with wiseman 1 too, most of my losses are from taking the wiseman 1 and 2 signal... how did bill use this signal? did he still use it?? im really curious how he handles wiseman signal, i followed everything from the book but still.. not work for me...

--- 帖子 #954 ---
They are high risk signals because they usually are a long way from stop loss points.  One way to limit risk is try to find great angulation on a small bar or candle.  This way, you get to take the counter-trend trade at the bottom (bearish divergence bar) of the bar.  Your stop in this case would be the top of the same bar.

I also find that divergence bars often show up at pivot points.  That's a trade worth taking in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Wiseman 1 would have cleaned up over the last week. Wheat, GBP, AUD, corn,beans, indexes, metals, the whole shootin match. Also, if I had been paying attention, a lot of wave 4 bottoms coinciding with said Wiseman 1's. Thats what makes it confounding sometimes. Not seeing the forest for the trees. I have always thought there has to be a concrete setup for the wiseman 1. Rather than the semi-subjective angulation, etc. Any idea's. crghill, I like your thoughts, small range squat wiseman 1's always seem to work. How do you define "pivot points"?

--- 帖子 #956 ---
GreenRiver,

You mentioned your contact with BW in a previous post. Having been through the home study as well as the seminar work, what's BW's take on Forex and the application of his system? Has he developed any specific alterations for the Forex market that aren't in the three books? I spoke with his daughter a few months ago and she was fairly critical of the Forex market with its lack of regulation, centralized market, etc.

I purchased this course, read all of Bill Williams books and was hooked. BUT, when I implemented it in the forex spot market it just didn't work. So, I programmed the strategy to include all the custom indicators and order execution to backtest and see what was wrong. I tried optimization with realistic terms, not just to conform to historical data (this is big difference if you are not familiar with the faults and limitations of backtesting). I also forward tested (real time). After more than 6 months I concluded that their may be potential for extremely long term trading with some modifications. But trying to apply this chaos strategy out of the box from the books and course just didn't work. I have read articles regarding modifications for spot forex, but they all, also concluded that the theory did not produce reality. I love the idea, but it just didn't' work for spot trading. At least not for me.

I like John Person's pivot calculations.  I plot those and look for PA around them.  If I can get angulation and a small divergence bar (especially if that db opened and closed at the same or nearly same price) then I'm interested.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
I don't think there is any way to program this system.  I'm not surprised that it didn't work once programmed.  This system is meant to be traded using human interpretation of the many different aspects.  For instance, you get a breakout fractal but an intertwined alligator.  I often ignore that signal.  I miss a trade here or there but patience is the virtue for Chaos and without it....you sink.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Trading Chaos cannot be programmed, and that is its most appealing quality in my mind. I would say chaos needs a little fib and ewave. I was breakeven the first year trading by "the book", then just started tweaking it a bit. I had more than my share of 10k + profits evaporate in one day early on. But by taking profits at fib targets, not trading choppy markets, being very patient things turned around. The difference between breakeven and making money is very small. Just a few tweaks, maybe a little intuition. How can you program that? I have written systems for tradestation and I am familiar with system programming. I have been asked by institutions to code my chaos trading. I know it wont work and say no to them.
Bill and Justine were negative on forex but I am not sure where they stand now. People post here who are making money. I am here because this is the only place on the net where people talk chaos.

--- 帖子 #961 ---
GreenRiver,

Would you post a current trade or two? I've found that Chaos for spot Forex can't be applied successfully (on a daily basis) without some modification.  As far as creating a program, there may be too many variables, especially after the tweaks that are needed.

Swamper

--- 帖子 #962 ---
yup i agree that his method can't be programmed..

so r u saying that bill and justine dont trade forex???

--- 帖子 #963 ---
My understanding is that they trade currency futures but not spot Forex, but I've only spoken with Justine once about this.  Someone else may have more insight.

Thanks!

Here is a trade example of the GBP futures. Look how much I left on the table, but I don't care, I was able to grab some $'s and get out quick. This is not the chaos way. Thats why I mentioned earlier I was working on letting things run more, but to tell the truth, trading like this evens out your P&L. You wont catch the big moves but you keep the $'s coming in and you don't get the "up 5-10k only to get out break even" trade. There really is no secrect to this. The 1.27 reverse fib ext is from a book by Carlyn Boroden called Fibbonaci Trading. Also read anything by Robert Miner. Combine this with Bill and Justines stuff and there are 50 different ways to put together a winning system.

ooo spot forex, i see.. thx for the insight..

i have no doubt with his trend following approach, all his stuff in his new trading dimension is totally amazing...

but i'm having trouble following trading chaos 2nd edition, wiseman 1, 2, well maybe im too lazy to study the elliot wave hehehehe... but i totally agree elliot wave and bill williams method combined, superb...

thx gr

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Special thanks to GreenRiver for discussing his method.

I'd like to add one thing.

I use only 3 indicators and use only 1 Entry method. Answer to an earlier question on entries: I make entries on m1. I try to get in early on a possible m5 trend. and then add on on m1 fractal breakouts. This roughly covers all of the entry methods of New Trading Dimensions. Well not all but near.  I've learned one thin in life, and its paying off big time, t hats keep things simple. Because M1 and M5 is too fast a place to do all 7 kind of entries this method is taking care of my a/c.  I'm just satisfied with what i get. e.g. the following chart would show this kind of pips can turn you into someone else!

My most important point to anyone here would be this. Understanding Chaos requires getting rid of Linear thinking. pip targets, %age targets, objective system approach, technical analysis all of it limits your understanding of Chaos. Chaos = Freedom. Chaos = New Incoming Information. You must learn to let information organize itself. I've found out through personal experience and observation that human mind has 2 basic problems with accepting chaos. 1. We check every new information with what we already know. That measn we have to look in to the past. 2. We always want to predict what would be the effect and possible outcomes due to this new incoming information. Chaos is half predictable and half non predictable. We must stop predicting the future and forget the past. "The past is not beneficial and Future is mildly beneficial ". IMHO as long as you dont know the power of Saddle point it will be difficult to trade chaos.

Wiseman! The technique of the latest book, which itself is about 6 years old now, is a trend reversal technique. Bill Williams does touch this entry even in the earlier version of the Home Study Course. I remember he mentions something about a stage of knowing when to break your rules. I assume he mean the advanced level to understanding of trading where you develop a feel for the market, perhaps developed intuition. But It does not mean you should not employ the trending technique of the previous books. It simply means that if you are in a choppy period or at the end of a fast moving trend,  u could employ this strategy to get in early. otherwise if you can find saddle points here and there, then trend trading is far better then reversals. as long as we "Want what the market wants" we will enjoy trading and make money at the same.

cheers

ps: i'm in on another m1 trade as I write this. looking good so far. entry from 1.3302.

hi yousafzai i tried to trade the 5 min chart, but i got whipsaw 3 times total of minus 97 pips..  still wondering how did you trade smaller timeframe?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Here is what I think

Most Important point to consider: Time your trades with break of Fractal and first few bars on AO. Trust me you're winners will increase.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
[quote=yousafzai;4223601]Special thanks to GreenRiver for discussing his method.quote]

No, the thanks should all go to you and your sharing. Seeing you post your charts inspired me to chime in. I have copied and saved your charts for future reference and study. Like you said, those fractals that are nice and tight to the gator are the one's to go after! When you talk about the first few bars on the AO, do you mean after crossing the zero line or the first few after changing from red to green or vice versa?

--- 帖子 #972 ---
i entered the 1st fractal then i stop and reverse on the 2nd fractal, then i stop and reverse again with the 3rd fractal, but i didn't stop and reverse with the 4th fractal and missed the move  that's why i get -97 pips hehe..

hmm maybe if i took the outer fractal, i wouldn't have missed the 4th fractal

thx for the explanation yousafzai

oo one more thing, where did you put ur stop? red line on the 1m chart or 5m chart or u just let it run until u meet a divergence?

--- 帖子 #973 ---

Its so good to see others doing the same or similar stuff. Makes it more interesting and I look forward to what others have been upto etc. But I've learned that public forums are a dangerous place to be. you get all sorts of criticism for nothing. if you do bad people would say, oh what a loser, if you do good others would say oh what a big head, lier, scammer etc. But as we all know humans come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, colours etc

I'd like to see more of your charts but I also understand that while you post one chart I might have posted 50 within your single trade. just kidding

I have a question for you before I answer yours, please tell me you were long EU from Sep to Oct?

I'll post a picture here to show what I mean by "first few bar of AO with break of AIMS/Fractal". yes its when it crosses ZL.

Alligator: I do bracket the M5 but only when ,as we call it depth of AIMS is not more then 20 pips, i.e. distance between outermost fractals is not too wide (but its not a mathematical constant, just a guess work) on M5. if it is I have M1 to guide me, I count wave on m1, so lets say if by the time price comes near my entry on M5 bracket and its already showing peak on AO I'll be careful and use M1 setup, that is First bar of AO and break of AIMS as my entry. Like yesterday by the time it came near my M5 bracket i was already 30pip in profit.  I hope it makes sense. Its hard to talk about and explain this multi dimensional reality using uni-dimensional medium.

cheers to all.

Yousafzai - in your post you seem to suggest the best way is to treat BW indicators as a way to see inflection points in the market and waves to see the bigger picture and wanting what the market wants. Is this correct, if it is and you're therefore trading in multi timeframe space do you think it would be possible to automate execution and minimise reaction time? I see the merit of what you're doing but I'm too new to BW methods (awaiting delivery of home study material) to see whether it can be automated.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #975 ---
I say the above because what BW teaches actually fits an EA in your brain. Well, it actually activates the EA of your right brain. Which is there but the left brain wont let it work. Once you know how to deal with left brain your right brain EA is activated and you trade automatically.

Automation could be possible but I wont enjoy trading it. Chaos and Linear Geometry dont work. Straight lines, Boxes, Rectangles, Triangles, are equivalent to pip targets, %age of a/c targets etc. thats wanting what you want. Automation would require your brain behind it. Since no EA can be as powerful as a human brain we learn to automate our own right brain and then trading becomes automated. IMHO>

Hi guys, Which fractal would you take if we see a saddle point like this??

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Alligator!

Well I cannot really give you an honest opinion now because its too late. But when I looked at the chart first, without pulling the chart of AUDUSD, (i dont trade this pair, because I only trade EU) I would have gone with inner most before the Alligator was opening to that side. so probably 3 Long and 3 short. Check the H4 and you'd see a long Setup so gives you a healthy bias. but the daily is still sideways so this could be an early entry if it breaks out or otherwise. take profit at the daily high fractal .9965 area etc etc.

IMHO

--- 帖子 #981 ---
My personal opinion:  Each and any, if it was triggered by price! Long fractals only above / sell fractals only below alligator!  So:

Stop orders above (black) fractals 3 and 4 should have been placed and hit before. As price is now below the highs of those, place the stop-orders now a few ticks above their highs. And place stop-orders above highs of fractal 2 and 1.

Don`t  forget reverse pyramiding, i.e. 5 lots (mini..) for the first position (fractal4), 4 lots for second entry (fractal3), 3 lots for fractal 2........

You can also already place stop orders for the corresponding sell fractals, which would be hit only, if price meets and triggers those BELOW alligator.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
thx for the response yousafzai and forex37, appreciate that

@yousafzai: so you'll take the fractal that is near to the alligator, not the outer one, ic.. correct me if i'm wrong, and also you look at a higher timeframe to look for direction.. right? I was wondering, can we trade only looking at one timeframe?

@forex37: weww reverse pyramiding, guess i'm not ready for that hehehe.. would give it a shot though next time  maybe start with 2/3 not 5 hahahaha.. thx for the info

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Don`t forget reverse pyramiding, i.e. 5 lots (mini..) for the first position (fractal4), 4 lots for second entry (fractal3), 3 lots for fractal 2........

Forex37,

My understanding of pyramiding or scaling according to BWCT is that the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, sequence starts on the second buy or sell signal not the first.  The first signal is a test buy/sell of 1 lot (or whatever portion of a lot that you are working with).

Swamper

--- 帖子 #984 ---
The first signal (Wiseman 1) is a DB (Divergent Bar), but this is not always the start! But good remark: the often discussed DB should only be entered with 1/5 th of the regular entry size. I think, that`s what most of those who expressed bad experience with DB, missed. The Wiseman 1 is only a small risk (due to 1/5 size and close stoploss). But if not stopped out, it will collect enough pips during its travel to Wiseman2 to make the Wiseman2 entry small risk as well.

As DB requires a final extreme acceleration (steep angulation) before that trend stalls, it is rare! Most trends just fade and with a sleeping alligator change direction to new rise of a new trend. There you got to watch out: A candle that is mainly BELOW alligator can form a buy fractal which can be met, if its high can be met within the alligator!

Hi Imran,

Good to see that you are active on this forum! I miss your daily updates to the BD Aimigos thread - As do a number of the members... Oh well, onwards and upwards and all that!

I missed the end of the Aimigos thread debate as I was offline for a few days, but if you still want some of your notes and charts, I have saved them in a Word document. PM me.

Your simple approach has been of immense benefit to my trading psychology, so thank you very much indeed!

I see that you no longer use St. McD in favour of the AIMS AO.

Comparing the two, the signals are similar but the AO is definitely smoother.

Can you please elaborate on how you altered the AO code to present a similar colour scheme to St. McD? I have been fiddling with the code, but to no avail.

Cheers,

Fxday

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Yes 100%.
It is abosolutely possible and is the best way of  trading it. Dont confuse your belief system with my belief system. I  trade 2 TF simultaneously. But if I were to trade only one of it I will  still do good and so will anyone else. Remember that BW never speaks of  the way I trade. Its just my own way of seeing things. In fact it would  be best to trade only 1 TF. Whichever TF is your choice. but my Fav is  M1, M5 and H4.

--- 帖子 #987 ---
i have been reading you post keep it up.......1M to fast and 4hrs way to long, i use 15tf only for entry and close of daily candle before i go to bed, Trade 2 pairs now GU and EU. wait for WM1 or WM2 in-respectful of divergence and Alligator.

This is off topic I just created an account here so I could get in touch with old Imran whos been posting on your thread a lot.  I'd have not posted on your thread but "Junior Accounts" aren't allowed to send a private message.

Imran!  I've been missing your posts since about the 3rd week of November on a certain other forum named after a certain color of dog!  What happened?  Why were all your posts and journals deleted?  I had saved them all to my hard drive, fortunately, but there is some censorship going on and I'm really wondering why!

I have been using and loving your AIMS system for some time, are you now sharing it publicly with anyone?  Is this where you're going to be doing your postings from now on?

Feel free to send me a private message instead of putting this info out there for all to see.  I'm really curious what happened between you and Dave.  You were my favorite poster over there.

Thanks again Imran we miss you over at that other forum!

Hey, here's a question for all of you BW followers. Let's say we think we're in a wave 4. I understand that one of the minimum requirements of a wave 4 is that the AO drops below the zero line (for a long). My question is, does the dip below the zero line have to occur on the time frame you are trading? In other words, if I am trading the daily chart and the AO does not go below zero on the daily, but does on the 4 hour, does that qualify?

I can't post a chart right now, but the EU daily is a good example I think. Assuming the point zero, the beginning of wave one down, is November 4. You can see two pretty clear waves down, with the apparent wave 3 having a more pronounced AO, thus qualifying it as a wave 3. Since then, there has been some retracement/sideways movement, but the AO has remained below zero. Dropping down to the 4 hour chart, the AO did cross back above the zero line.

What does anyone/everyone think?

Thanks,

Richard

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Hi folks,

I trade similar to the BW method. I scale heavily in intraday trends with the use of visual tools but focusing on price as an indicator.

With regards to entries ive noticed the theme here is to enter on fractal breaks in direction of trend.

My question is:

Is there certain "requirements/rules" to validate and classify a good potential fractal from a bad fractal to enter with?

Many times price spikes and forms fractals which in themselves if used to enter can get you in considerably later than a smaller fractal or even a pullback entry.

And also with regards to stop placement. Is the stop place arbitrarily on a moving average or in a specific area away from price?

Thanks guys and merry christmas hehe

Seems like a nice bunch of people learning here.

Hi Richard,

Remember from Trading Chaos 1st Ed  on page 125, the number of bars you need for an Elliott Wave Pattern, so too soon for the daily. You are looking at either a completed 5 waves with a wave 2 retrace (Big wave 3 now starting) or a 4th wave retrace (5th wave starting now) in the 240 min chart. Its hard to tell because there is no divergence in the AO peaks within the 240 min chart. Euro is a tough nut to crack right now because the Daily and Weekly patterns are blown some what. In the Daily though, notice the AO came back almost to zero? Thats typical of wave 2's although the pattern looks a little short for a wave 2. Looking at the weekly..... could it be a 1-2 1-2 starting to the downside with a monster wave 3 coming????

Who knows!

Regards

--- 帖子 #995 ---
if we are in wave 4, we should (choose one):

1. avoid trading on wave 4 (there are whipsaw)

2. going to smaller timeframe. forexample, we did trade on wave 4 with TF H4, we going to TF M15 (so play short).

if you play on TF H1, you should watch on that timeframe only, don't worry about the D1 (just use D1 as major trend so you will follow the trend).

cmiiw ....

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Thanks GR. This brings up another question I have regarding the number of bars needed for an EW pattern. What exactly do you mean when you say Elliott Wave Pattern? Is it a full 5 wave sequence, one wave of the sequence, or one impulsive and one corrective wave? Or something else? Which one of these is supposed to fit into the 100 to 140 bars?

BTW, whenever I see your posts I always think of the old CCR song "Green River" http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif

Thanks again for the help,

Richard,

The Green River is where I used to go fly fishing every year in Utah with my Dad and brothers. Sadly, he is too old to make the trip anymore, but he fished and hunted from 5 yrs old to 81 yrs old! Hope I make it that long.

I always took it to mean all waves or you should view charts with that many bars, look for the peak and work back from there. If the setup ie AO to zero, is in the 4H chart, just trade from there. Or, there was a sell fractal the other day in the daily to take, but know that you are working a 5 in the 4H and be nimble ie, get out on a BRB.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Thanks. These days I rarely look at a chart smaller than a 60 minute. Even at that I'm just looking for wave clarity if I can't see it higher up. Still trying to put it together regarding EW. Sometimes I get it, sometimes......not so much.

Hi folks,

Quick question.

Anyone here ever attempted to combine the Joe Ross TTE (traders trick entry) along with BW's system/concepts?

In essence the difference would be getting in earlier than the fractal setup but without "interfering" with his strategies.

Any thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Oh yeah man i have read the book from both of them and bill williams also talk about Joe Ross on how he uses fractal in his method..you can surely trade fractal without adding it to your chart just to keep it simple but i do combine the two together.

why i like BW system is cus it give me clue on how to add on my position and when to stay on with many rules in seeking for entry, i did not combine the TTE but i use 123 as my alligator breakout and will be expecting a retrace on every breakout after my first entry which is divergence.

i dont use AO as addon but i like to enter with my divergence bar for small risk and fractal breakout as my 123 setup as confirmation.

it's great with lot of discipline you can give it a try .

cheers Don

I have been using Chaos for over a year now and have found it to be simple and fun. I have kind of cherry picked those entries that I like and use them as often as I can. One of these entries is the Wiseman 2, I was wondering if anyone interested in Chaos would find a benefit in putting a signal on the BW Wiseman-2 indicator so that it would message the trader when the signal occurred? I have consistently made an easy 25-35 pips on this 99% of the time it plots.

Is anyone interested in helping do this?

I am using this system, but I found that sometimes it could be dangerous for counter trend like divergence ao (in trading chaos 2nd edition).

actually the 2nd edition of trading chaos too dangerous to be followed, If possible just use fractal and alligator for trading. Wait for bigger time frame to confirm first (for example when we trade on H1, make sure D1 or H4 is confirmed one way first)... or else you will got whipsawed ...

yes squat bar was the first name he use for divergence bars.

there should be atleast 1 squat bar in 5 consecutive  bars that make valid fractal..

Alligator 1example..  the candle made higher high and close on it half with valid anagulation.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
hmm.. ic so squat bar is bdb.. thx..

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Not exactly. A squat bar is a bar where price makes a new high/low with lots of volume but not a lot of range in that movement. Not all reversal bars are squats and not all squats are reversal bars. There is however a similarity in that both reversal bars and squats can happen at the end of a trend.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
oo ic ic.. do you know how to mark a squat bar on mt4 just like on bw chart where he has it with a blue color??

thx

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
On MT4 there is an indicator called BW MFI which displays as volume type bars at the bottom of the screen. Each one of BW's four Profitunity Windows is represented by different color coding. The squat bar is described as having greater tick volume and a lower MFI (Market Facilitation Index which is range divided by volume) than the previous bar. Williams describes it as a battle between bulls and bears, with lots of activity but little movement, sort of like the market is "squatting" before making it's next move. As Rbr trader mentioned, a squat bar in and of itself does not necessarily signal the end of a trend. It is one of Williams 5 magic bullets that when combined together almost always signal the end of the current wave. Please read Trading Chaos the first edition for a thorough explanation.

The only problem for me here is this. I understand that in the forex market volume statistics are somewhat inaccurate and not reliable, so the squat bar and BW's other Profitunity Windows might be rendered ineffective. Does anyone have better knowledge or experience regarding forex volume?

Richard

The indicator is actually just called the Market Facilitation Index and it should be part of the regular MT4 indicator package. Let me know if you have trouble finiding it.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
i mean without looking at the mfi, so everytime a squat bar appear it will be automatically mark as a blue color bar/candle. in investor dream (bw charting software), they have this kind of facilitation, but investor dream is no longer available, i dunno if metastock n other charting can do that.

i was just wondering if mt4 can do the same..

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
hey all

havent been here since forever .. but thought i just jump in quickly.

i am still using this method .. also pretty profitably i would have to say. i only do fractal trades combined with the Elliott Wave though. I barely enter on div bars or anything else.

regarding the squat bar and why i never pay attention to it: in my opinion, correct me if i am wrong, it makes no sense using this bar if you have the "average joe forex account." thats because your broker will only show you the volume that goes through their desk, but the volume of all the other brokers is not shown. with that, you might get squat bars where there actually is none, or you get none where there is one. so, unless you trade currency futures through cme or have an interbank account, it doesnt make sense using it since its based on incomplete information your broker shows you.

also what i would like to add is, that this method is profitably enough without any squat or divergent bars. picking tops or bottoms in a trend following system really isnt necessary and might just cost you more than what it makes. entering on the fractals at saddle points is highly profitable on higher timeframes for me. i am more interested in following a long move than trying to casino-play div bars going against a major trend. of course, there are certain div bars (the ones occurring at the end of wave 2 and wave 4) that can be identified easier, and that work very well. but they are still a casino signal compared to what the fractal provides for you.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
hmm.. good point..

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Slight,

Good to hear from you again. I quit trading for about two years and am just getting my feet wet again, but I remember seeing your posts back then. Your answer regarding volume was well reasoned and makes sense to me, so thanks for that.

I'd like to know more about your trading style. It appears you're trading BW's chaos 2nd edition without the divergent bars? I visited your blog and it looks like your mostly trading daily charts? Also I notice you trade other markets which also interests me. I have a trading partner who is into ETF's and othere equity instruments. I'm curious if you have found any brokers who use MT4 for equities, futures, etc.

Anyway, I will read your blog in more depth, but anything you care to share here about your trading would be welcome. I'm particularly interested in your interpretation of Elliott Waves and how you determine where we are in the sequence.

Cheers,

Richard

Hi Richard,

I also remember you from some time back, good to see you around again. I have been absent myself, but I have been studying various markets and been active trading-wise every single day...

In the following I hope I can give you a little bit more insight into what I know and do regarding Chaos ... feel free to ask more questions - it can only benefit the both of us and everyone who cares to read through this thread.

You correctly observed about my trading style, that I pretty much only trade daily charts. I have found it to be the most consistent and reliable timeframe that also suits my daily schedule. Plus, I remember AvidTrader, who has met Mr Williams and bought, I believe, 2 versions of the homestudy course, saying that Bill Williams recommended it makes sense to stick to the higher timeframes with this system. Signals appear at more significant levels and trends unfold clearer from those points on. There is much less noise (esp in FX) and that makes it a lot easier to know where to get in, put the stop and get out again. Daytrading has not proven to be profitable for me on smaller TFs like the 10m or whatever you would prefer. Combining this with one significant higher timeframe can give you a good idea of where the next trend is going to go.

My knowledge is based on TC2, as you correctly observed. However, I do combine it with the Elliott Wave and Saddle points (= no div bars for me) from earlier books. This way, I make sure to stay away from any gambling trades that kill too much of my equity. I dont have a problem leaving some profit on the table, waiting for those saddle points to set up and then enter for a relatively safe trade after an initial move. Especially in FX I noticed that div bars are highly vague and the concept of angulation doesnt make a difference at all. Sometimes there is angulation and the div bar doesnt work, sometimes there isnt and it works perfectly well. I wasnt able to make sense of that until now, so I am staying away.

I would also like to mention, that other markets such as stocks (that includes Indices like SP500, Dow, Nasdaq etc) and commodity markets are much better suited for this system as the FX markets. If you bother to check out some charts of those markets and the way trends behave and move, you will find that they are much more stable. What I mean by that is, that once underlyings on those markets have established a trend, it seems much easier for them to continue that trend from a chaos trading perspective compared to the FX market. I, for instance, have developed a much higher trust in those markets than the FX market. E.g. when price is right at the green line and you kind of know that the next day will be the desicion-day regarding "will I have to close out this position or let it run", the stocks & commodity underlyings can be trusted much more regarding the continuation of the trend (thats also true for Bonds). It has happened all too often to me that forex pairs didn't give about the green line (meaning: the green line just doesnt mean we are at a significant level of correction) and just go against me even hundreds of points (on the daily..) .. meaning the next day price closes WAY above/below the green line. Stocks & Commodities run much smoother in that respect.

I am pretty sure you will not find a single broker offering futures and etf's on MT4. What you do find is commodity trading via CFDs on MT4. Honestly, MT4 is a pretty shitty platform compared to what you could afford if you were a serious stock or future's trader. Tradestation, Metastock or CQG, even Ninjatrader (I am sure there are others...) are the platforms you want to trade off if you are willing to put more money into the market. MT4 is simple to deal with regarding settings and putting in orders, but it is a piece of s/-/!7 compared to what you can do, and the reliabilty(!) of the above mentioned platforms.

I dont really know why, but a lot of people are asking me about the Elliott Wave. I have not been to a tutorial nor did I have any help from outside regarding the EW counting with the AO. I just studied the book Bill W. explains the EW in and did that like crazy. It took a while until the "aha effect" set in, but now it is just automatic. I see a chart and if there is a clear wave count (you dont always know what wave you are in - from a mail from Justine Williams - I can tell you that this is even true for them) you see what wave you are in immediately. It doesnt even take a split-second, it's simply automatic. So if you dont know how to count the waves, it's simply because of a lack of studying, not because there is some additional twist to it that is not mentioned anywhere. I have taught counting the wave to 3 other traders, and they are perfect at it now.. you only have to make the effort to go through the explanation a thousand times and compare it with the live charts you are looking at right now.

Altogether it has been my experience that the FX market is kind of tough to trade with this system. It seems there is much noise, even on high timeframes.

I am always active trading Indices and commodities and have a much higher success rate there. Even div bars are easy to spot and work hella good in those markets .. I love to take them at the end of corrections in an on-going trend .. you pretty much cant miss them, even in unpredictable wave 4s.

I hope that cleared up some questions you had.

Have a good weekend, and good trading to you!

Slight, thanks for the thorough reply. I agree with your assessments about the forex market. I am doing a little scapling and some swing type trading, but I don't really have time for that, so I'm glad to have a trading partner with deeper pockets than I who wants to trade other markets. speaking of that, how do you determine what you are going to trade? Do you have some favorite commodities or equities that you like? Having had most of my trading experience in the forex, I feel overwhelmed at the amount of choices out there, and I'm wondering how you go about narrowing them down.

As to trading platforms, I have a shared Tradestation account with my partner, but he's got some autotrader running on it most of the day so I can't get on the platform very often. I have Ninjtrader but haven't messed with it too much. I'll have to see if I can work up BW's indicators as they don't seem to be part of the standard indicator package.

Then on Elliott Wave, I never really got too far into it when I was active before, but I knew there was something to it, and now I see that everything fits in wave of one degree or another. I'll keep studying and looking for them. Sometimes I see them, sometimes not.....

So thanks for the help, I appreciate it.

Well I just select about 20 charts from the commodities, stocks and index area that I will watch all the time. when something is going on on one of them, i just take it. should there be nothing going on on anything, then I will add a new chart. it very rarely happens though.

I know someone who has all the indicators going in NT .. I can ask him for the code or how he managed to have them show, if you like.

Good Trading..

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
I guess the 20 that you trade regularly are ones that you cover in your blog? I'll keep an eye on it, and also look around some. BTW, I noticed you've posted a couple of times over in the Commodities and Stocks forum. Anything worthwhile to learn over there?

If you can pass along the indi's or a template, workspace, whatever they call it for NT that would be great.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
I cover them on my blog partially... most of the time I try to put up what people could be interested in. Orange juice or Lead won't come up that often.

I have kind of stopped posting there for no particular reason. I kind of lose touch with posting on forums again and again... I mainly just trade than talk about it

I'll try to see if I can get the bw stuff for you .. I'll let you know.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
hey mate whats new...long term, inraday scalp work with trading chaos so far..

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
nice post mate...i suck in wave counting but getting use to it since i think it's important using the fractal....wave 4 are bastard ...

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Hello, guys. I have just started trading this system, however, right now only in the demo account. I'm trading it only for one week. I don't want any fast results, but to sum up this week was very bad. I had only loss'es and no profits trading it. Right now i'm only using WS1, WS2 and WS3, aligator and AO, no wave counting..

I've tried trading on 5min chart, but it was bad. I think it is better on bigger charts such as 4h and bigger..

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
you need to add the wave count IMO....trading ws1 and ws2 are way to risky for me so i mainly trade ws3 , i will miss alot of pips but i prefer to be in confirmation and consistence profit. 5min is bad my best tf is 15tf,1hr and daily..the trend in 4hrs are often confirmation of swing not intraday ..

i only watch daily closing price and pick entry on 15tf, so try demo and practice little wave count 1-2-3-4-5 and abc correction..caution of wave 4 is often correction and need consecutive bars to complete..

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Still in the same position, however, it started to go against my short. While it will not close abode the lips (green line) I will not close my position.

I like this system and it really fits my style, however, after one week of trading and not a one profitable trade.. Am i doing something wrong?

I will try posting charts here. Maybe you guys will help me a bit with this...

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Use the wave count, it'll help you a lot. Make sure you have the 5 magic bullets when taking wm1..

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Hi Isto,

I'm Reading Bill Williams' Trading Chaos now, Its been very helpful so far (Novice Trader), and actually your posts over here got me to the read the book from the first place.

I'm having troubles applying the Elliot waves in level 2, i'd be grateful if'd have any help from you explaining or handing me some links for online Tutorials as the ones i found were very unhelpful.

Thank you.

watch this videos on youtube 1-9 video when u get on youtube look up for them. it will help u with the wave count.

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Thank you. This has been very helpful.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
I agree with what alligator and donfriday have said, wave count is very important. Also, using the fractals should be all you want to do in the beginning. Div bars and the AO signals will make more sense as you can count the waves properly.

ealas, about your 4h ES trade. You did it correctly. The only mistake I see is that you enter way too late. Your entry seems to be at a fractal in the middle of the trend. At this point, there are people taking profit already. This should only be an add-up entry for you. And if you check the higher timeframes you see that we are not merging into a downtrend but what you traded is just a correction.

So what you should look at is how you could get in earlier. A good entry would have been the fractals at 1307 and 1305 (guessing those prices from your chart.)

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
I found a good setting to use Gator Oscillator... 17 pips anyone?

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
how does your think work? What is AIMS?

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Hi!

Two new trades. Circle is the signal. I've entered where a trend line was crossed. I know that signal of DBA according to Bill Williams rules is not active, however, i tooks this trade.

Lets see what will happen.

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
Are there anybody trading this system? Very quiet over here.

Ok my FDX trade is going very nice. Rules were telling to go long and i did it. Waiting for new signals.

DBA is not going the right way as i thought about it. However, I traded against profitunity system, because i opened a long position when alligator was above long fractal (we can not do this in this system). But i believe in agriculture and will keep it until it gets below 33.45 (it will be a short signal).

Right now i am keeping an eye on one more stock HAS. I've uploaded a chart. Waiting for a break out signal.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
yea it's usually more than quiet around here. dunno why, I guess people are thrown off very quickly with this system since you need more (imo) than just the stuff mentioned in TC2. Talking about the waves here... as i posted in reply to your comment on my blog already, if you have a good grasp on the waves, you know much better what the market is doing and where to get in and where not.

If you like to chat about trading more, come to IRC

about your trades .. the HAS you are looking at is pretty much exactly what you want. Even though it looks like you could be in this one already, the breakout up there looks like the perfect signal to me. Not so much on your DBA. You entered too soon in my opinion and you are in what looks like a wave 4. those are killers. I usually give the market a lot of time to set up a nice buy fractal before I get in again. That usually takes some time. Especially since the previous trend went on for a pretty long time, you can expect this wave to go sideways for longer than you might like ...

gl anyhow and see you around!

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Closed my DBA trade. I opened this trade against the system rules. It didn't went the way i thought it will, so i closed the deal. However, FDX trade is working very well (bought at 90.51, last price 93.18).

Also I've found another interesting trade CSCO. As far as I understand EW (i don't know a lot about it) it is developing a 5 wave. However, i am looking for a long @ ~17.70.

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Just entered CSCO on a 5min chart 17.31. Hope to see at least 17.40 for a quick profit.

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
perfect day trade

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
so what made you exit on this daytrade?

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Slight, you are right. There were not any signal to exit, however, my target was 17.40, moreover, i decided that i will close this position before the end days. I didn't wanted to leave it overnight.

Although when it will reach 17.70 I will open a longer timeframe trade

What do you think about my trades? Do you see any flaws?

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
ok good argument. if i daytrade i too exit before the market closes not matter what. holding a low timeframe trade over night doesn't make a lot of sense imo.

i like your fdx, has and csco intraday trade. notice that on all of them it looks like the market has found the bottom, then rises, creates a fractal above the alligator, corrects, then takes that up-fractal. that is the ideal situation to buy.

i dont like the other 2 trades you have. your daily buy on csco has not made an upmove and given a fractal. you are entering on an up-fractal that is the high of a correction within a downmove. in these cases oftentimes the market goes lower and stops you out. at least that is my experience. even though you traded it like williams says, the safer deal is to do it like on the above mentioned underlyings. the same happened on the dba trade where you exited already...

all in all pretty good though

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Slight, thanks for your comments! They are very valuable.

FDX trade is going just perfect. Check the jpg in this post.

Moreover, I've found a very interesting setup at F. This setup is very similar to FDX and HAS. Price was consolidating in this lever for a while and right now AO is showing bullish divergence, moreover, we have a fractal BUY signal. So I will keep an eye in this position. I'm planning to open a position in F at ~15.20. However, there is plenty of opportunities in intraday charts so I will be watching them also.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
yep all looking very nice  the buy on F is also upon the above described buy fractal. i love those entries the most.

btw, you do realize that your alligator is not displayed correctly ?!

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
What do you mean?

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
its not smoothly running. the lines are "hopping" around too much. should look more like this e.g. on DBA

you probably didnt apply the right settings for the smoothed moving averages or put in an exponential MA with the wrong settings ...

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
I've just copied the code from this webpage http://mikelapp.blogspot.com/2010/03...d-fractal.html

Well.. I don't know how to solve this problem... Mhmm.. :/

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
ah yea i see. i didnt get it working on thinkorswim either.

i didnt try using the alternative display with EMA's (exponential moving averg) though. maybe try that.

the settings are: blue line: 26, red line: 16, green line: 10, future offset as usual (8,5,3)

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
This is what I see at DBA

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
hmm still not right. i changed the settings on my chart and in yours the smoothing part is missing. So you are only running a simple average instead of a smoothed simple average. look if you can apply "Wilder's smoothing" or "smoothing" on the indicator settings. problem with the incorrect display is that fractal signals might occur different around the alligator and more importantly your exit will be incorrect.

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
This is the reason why (however, I don't know how to fix it):

ef JOffset = 8;

def Javg13 = ((high[12 + JOffset] + low[12 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg12 = ((high[11 + JOffset] + low[11 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg11 = ((high[10 + JOffset] + low[10 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg10 = ((high[9 + JOffset] + low[9 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg9 = ((high[8 + JOffset] + low[8 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg8 = ((high[7 + JOffset] + low[7 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg7 = ((high[6 + JOffset] + low[6 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg6 = ((high[5 + JOffset] + low[5 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg5 = ((high[4 + JOffset] + low[4 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg4 = ((high[3 + JOffset] + low[3 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg3 = ((high[2 + JOffset] + low[2 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg2 = ((high[1 + JOffset] + low[1 + JOffset]) / 2);

def Javg1 = ((high[0 + JOffset] + low[0 + JOffset]) / 2);

def SSMAJaws = ( Javg1 + Javg2 + Javg3 + Javg4 + Javg5 + Javg6 + Javg7 + Javg8 + Javg9 + Javg10 + Javg11 + Javg12 + Javg13) / 13;

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
Just placed a Buy STOP order F @ 14.89.

However, it is very bad that I have a bad aligator moving averages. I see it is a very serious problem which I have to solve.

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
unfortunately thats true. since i dont have a clue about programming either i cant really help you out. maybe contact the person who runs the blog you got it from. other than that there is the option of charting with a different software and only place your trades through thinkorswim. thats not ideal, but for daily trades good enough for the time being..

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
I have to fix this problem. For example, F (5min) trade was ruined, because a had a false signal. Well.. Are here anybody who can help me with aligator indicator for thinkorswim?

Here is the chart..

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
this can happen though. dont know what it looks like if the alligator is displayed correctly, if you would still be in this trade, but this can happen of course.

i just noticed another thing. with your alligator the red line is where the green line should be and vice versa in the above chart (its correct on other charts that you posted). did you notice that?! there seems to  be something inheretly wrong with the code you use. it's always the green line closest to the price in a trend. except you've set the colors another way, this is wrong too ..

i am afraid you cant expect much help here and go on search somewhere else, most people here use MT4 for charting and trading since it's a currency forum and MT4 seems to be the most popular platform.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Slight, I know that this forum is full of forex lovers, however, i didn't found anywhere where to discuss trading with this system. Do you know any better places?

FDX price today is consolidating, however, there is no sell signal, so I will stick with it for some time.

Opened a new small position at GE. Uploading my chart.

Have a small day trade at FAS. Opened my position at 30.28. Stop loss ~30

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
no i havent found a place where this system is discussed more intensively. actually i have found that most people drop trading it at some point so most of my connection to these people is no more. i am daily in various irc chatrooms on a financial network where many daytraders and longer term traders hang around. they trade all different systems though.

if you like we can get in touch more .. i pretty much run every messenger so we could hook up that way.

all you trades will make new highs  give it quite a bit of time and you're gonna see good profits. especially on the larger timeframes (daily) it'll be a lot of fun

good trading man..

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
One more very small trade. A bit late though..

Right now I will give some time for me and for the markets...

This is my portfolio for the moment:

AVL

HAS

FDX

GE

FAS

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
For the moment:

AVL +5%

FAS +3.1%

GE   +0.85%

HAS +0.87%

FDX +6.11%

nice..

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Closed my yesterdays AVL trade with 10.4% profit.

Slight, I know, I know.. However 10% per day is enough for me

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
hehe  but great piece of advice for you: never go against the rules. your trading here implies a certain degree of greed that was involved in this trade. it's really not about the money long term, it's about following the plan.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
You are totally right, HOWEVER, I think that 10% is good enough for a fast one day trade. On Monday this stock can be 20% down so I will be greedy.

I agree that we have to stick with the rules in FAZ, HAS, FDX, GE. Those stocks are huge. They are good for longer term investment.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
One more small trade with penny stock: bought BLDP at 2.39$. I love the weekly chart of it!

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
I think there's no better place to discuss this system other than this forum

hi ealas, which platform/broker do you use?

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Dear BW traders,

Would you please help me to find out the reasonable exit strategy that does not put back as much the accumulated profit to the market as possible?

According to the BW tenet, all of the existing positions are exited when the counter signal (bullish -> bearish divergent bar and vice versa) emerges. This would be okay when the market is sustainably trending (Awesome Oscillator is consecutively generating histograms in the identical color), but no one can tolerate too many whipsaws during the mediocre trends (the color of AO histograms is frequently alternating with each other).

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Hi! Glad that more people are joining our discussion.

I am using thinkorswim as a platform for my charts. My broker is MB Trading.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
hi poyais,

i use the bdb and green/red line as my exit, both has pros and cons. It's impossible to identify and exit at the top or the bottom..

if you use bdb/5 bar trailing stop u wont give back ur profit tat much, but you could miss the trend.

with the green/red line, u can stay with the market a bit longer and catch the big move, but on the other side, u could give away some of the profit. it's more like "win small or hit the jackpot"

what i do is whenever there's a divergence on the ao i tend to tighten my stop (using a bdb/5 bar trailing stop), if i see a strong trend, i use  the red/green line.

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Thank you for your valuable comments, Alligator.

May I ask if the green/red line means SAO (Wiseman 2)? Actually, I'm using the Wiseman 2 as the confirmation to enter all of the BW setups, Wiseman 1, Wiseman Fractals and Breakout Fractals. Believe me or not, this idea has successfully eradicated so many false signals.

I'd like to adopt your profit taking technique and keep my eyes on the imminent reversals being predicted by the AO divergences.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
no, i mean is when price close above/below the red/green alligator line.

i have a problem with wm 1 and 2, until now i haven't found the right setup, i rarely use it now, maybe you could post some chart so i can learn something

yeahh, AO divergence is when you need to watch the market carefully. it really help me a lot..

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Just wanted to say, I just checked your blog excellent stuff. Keep it up! cheers

Hi

We all know you can enter a market anywhere you like. Its the exits that would decide your profitability. having said that timing is the most important thing in trading. So we know how to time our entries, either trade off a sleep alligator (saddle point) or BDB depending on what your taste and the market conditions.

Likewise for exits we should let the market dictate which exit or should I rather say Profit Taking strategy should we employ. WE have a choice.

You can choose any one or a combination of the following. In the long run they balance out.

1. Trail last 3 or 5 candles. (Can be used as a standard exit technique in all sorts of market conditions.

2. Exit on either Red or Green Line. Chose to exit on close on red line during the start of the trend and then later on move your exit to green line.

However this cannot be used with Wiseman technique while you are trading into the mouth of alligator.

3. Exit on Divergence. This requires patience and also depends on how the market moves. e.g. If there is a runaway market, and you have consecutive green/red candles or bars you would not like to wait for divergence. Sometimes it would save you pips other times it would exit you early.

4. Trail behing 5 consecutive Red/Green Bars or Candles. This is best for any time frame but superb for For volatile markets and specially on Shorter Time Frames ie. all Intra day. This what I use the most. I also use or try to use one more technique.

5. Trail behind fractals. this is easy for me, because my AIMS Levels indicator shows it very clearly but may be as easy, visually to see using other forms of fractals.

I hope this helps.

Imran

ps: check out my Blog for one more technique, using Fib Expansion.

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
Thank you for sharing with your valuable ideas.

My current entry & exit system that employs Wiseman 2 as the confirmation is as follows.

Entry Place the pending order to buy at High of Bullish divergent bar + 1 pip and the stop loss at Low of the bar - n pips, or sell at Low of Bearish divergent bar - 1 pip and the stop loss at High of the bar + n pips. Buy at a current market price (current price >= buy stop level) or at the buy stop level (current price < buy stop level) when three positive AO histograms (0 > values) in green appear consecutively, or sell at a current market price (current price <= sell stop level) or at the sell stop level (current price > sell stop level) when three positive AO histograms (0 > values) in red appear consecutively. <-- Confirmation by loosely applied Wiseman 2. Exit Long is exited when bearish Wiseman 1 setup (with the confirmation by W2) is fulfilled - simultaneously the initial short entry is made. Short is exited when bullish Wiseman 1 setup (with the confirmation by W2) is fulfilled - simultaneously the initial long entry is made. Please note that the above is not a genuine stop & reverse system that always stays in the market. A couple of profit-taking techniques pause the routine before either Wiseman 1 or Breakout Fractal (with the confirmation by W2) makes a fresh start.

You may think this modification grossly deviates from the original BW tenet, since the counter-trend entry is no longer used. However, the W2 filter offers us a critical advantage that can eradicate false entry signals by W1 alone.

P.S.

Thank you for referring to your proprietary info in your blog, Imran.

Today I've closed my GE trade with a nice 2.9% gain. Moreover, I've closed my BLDP trade with a small loss.

Conclusion

I've opened GE trade according to the rules of profitunity trading system. This trade was perfect, though I didn't earned a lot, however, I traded when the system told me to trade.

On the other hand, I have one losing trade BLDP. I've entered to early (i was greed), i've entered to late (we can see a bearish divergence in AO indicator). However, I've closed my trade according to the system and I'm glad of it.

Cable had a saddle point on H1 last night. I bracketed the market and Put TP at FE 62. It worked well. Please check my blog for further details. here is a picture.

Nice trading!

I have one question for B.W. profitunity system lovers. Do you have a trading preparation sheet? I've read it about in first B.W. book. Right now i want to prepare something to watch monthly, weekly, daily results, indicators for futures, forex and stocks that i like.

Maybe there is someone who could share it? a?

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Hello,

In the world of Japanese Candlestick patterns, the followings are deemed as reversal signals. Tsutsumi (Engulfing pattern) Doji (and the variants such as Hammer for bullish or Hanging man for bearish) Kabuse (Piercing line for bullish or Dark cloud cover for bearish) Harami As it would be obvious for those familiar with them, the first three patterns are appropriately corresponded to Bullish/bearish divergent bar. However, the B/D/B doesn't encompass the Harami, which is the most likely reason when occasionally B/D/Bs do not appear around the top or bottom.

May I ask your thoughts as I think it is a critical flaw in the B/D/B concept?

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
BDB is just one way of entering a market. The whole idea is actually to trade chaos. Understand the structure of the market and act accordingly. When Price moves too fast and too far away from Alligator the rubber band principle comes into play. This is indeed a reversal technique. I get impression from majority of people that after the 2004 book perhaps taking reversal trades (wisemen technique) is the only way forward. I do not agree with that. I believe, and this is what I follow even all the way down to M1, the best place to start campaigns is saddle point. A proper sleeping alligator. I find that when you take setups under the umbrella of a 4th wave the BDB, Wiseman technique becomes very useful. But in the end, as long as you see trending markets, following trend is the best strategy. IMHO>

BDB is just a way of entering the market. 80% depends on your "mind". Moreover, a BDB only becomes worth trading when all the other requirements are met, that is angulation b/w Alligator and price, which is subjective because it depends on how experienced you are in the markets.

e.g: for H4 Traders, following trends and adding on each fractal would have been hugely profitable, just look at NZD/USD, EUR/JPY, USD,JPY, GBP,JPY, and AUS/JPY. Amazing.

yes yousafzai, I agree. No real need to look for countertrend opportunities when you have trending markets. i always think of it as traders getting really greedy. because when you look at what kind of a gamble countertrend-trading is, it appears to be flat out "stupid" to take those signals instead of keep on looking for underlyings that are simply in a trend. you just buy/sell the fractals in that direction .. doesn't get easier and more profitable than that. the underlyings yousafzai mentions are the best proof for that.. funnily though traders always talk more about the divergent bar than how to pick out good fractals for trend following .. that's a mystery to me.

Thank you for your valuable comments.

Actually, the backtesting EUR/USD in H4 by an Expert Advisor loyal to BW literature that my friend in Japan coded astoundingly produced 18,000 pips in year 2010 alone.

Thank you for your tip on referring to our currency, JPY pairs. We'd like to inform you of the precise backtesting results afterward.

As a mechanical trader, I have a concern that B/D/B excludes the Harami patterns, which brings about non-existent B/D/Bs around the top/bottom of every swing. As long as we take such a flaw into consideration, the current BW system can still change for the better. That's my point.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
poyais .. in my opinion there is no system that takes into account every possible formation in its signals or whatever you want to call the matter. if it's true what you say, that the BDB already corresponds to your above mentioned 3 patterns, thats astonishing. but I have to tell you that I couldnt care less if it does or if it doesnt. that does not make the system any better or worse. the system is what it is without anything else considered - candle stick patterns, trend lines, fibs or whatever. sure, everyone likes to change it around to fit his/her personality, but saying that it's a flaw in the system is a little out there in my opinion. it's just one way of looking at the market just as there are a thousand other profitable ways to do the same - and almost none of those correspond with each other..

also .. an ea making 18000 pts with this system .. well that sounds really good, I'd be very interested in actually seeing what trades it took and a proof of those results. i highly doubt though that it'll work for a long time. not even a really good trader will spot the permanent changes in the market right away, how will a computer program do that? it's impossible. it can't account for the differences of just the fractals at the end of a wave 1, in the middle of a wave 3 - let alone a wave 4 or the final change in trend on a high timeframe with a thousand divergences that just dont make a lot of sense in the technical perspective. so you see, i am a little sceptical here, don't mean to bash you or anything, but I just dont really see it ...

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
I agree with Yousafzia and Slight. Contra-trend trading is a fools game even using the Elloitt Wave. The simpler you make this system the better. Fractals out of a saddle point are the way to go. I do just fine not paying attention to the wave and trading bracketed and tight saddle points. If there is any drawback its that you have to have patience for the right  setup.

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
there is no reason to jump in the market at top or bottom if you can have patience for market to decide where to go, I have been using this system for a while and i think it worth the price they sell the home study course but only if one can afford it.

I Trade this system with Alligator if price above or below and using the fractal as my Elliot wave, i can also scalp on 15tf using the fractal for entry.

Wait for your setup and trail your profile, sometime it you will earn more profile and sometime you will have small profit.

you will know when to get it when to trail profit and where to put profit, you will know why you are getting the market and why you are staying out and also what the market is doing especially in bastard wave like wave 4.

Nothing is 100% in life and i believe we all have chaos in our life..

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
After several days range, i have small lose on the last entry but still running until we complete wave 4 it will turn profit 4hrs chart still showing good down move.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Nice trade there, 2 Questions:

1. Did you not consider exiting on the consecutive bars exit signal around 12 april?

2. Moreover, dont you think H4 is showing a possible 4th wave after the previous impulse wave up?

cheers

Bill Williams systems make perfect sense.  If you take the time to test each entry system and pyramiding system along with the various exit signals, the entire methodology Bill Williams created is extremely practical and based in plain common sense.  Just one reading of the book should have convinced any reader that Bill Williams is on the Cutting edge of trading thought.  For one the basic statement he makes in Chaos 1st edition, he says "the basic underlying structure of the market is the Elliot Wave and the basic underlying structure of the Elliot Wave is the Fractal."  He also states that the sometimes unseen structure is our own individual belief systems concerning the market.  This is one of the most logical breakdowns of how to look at the market from a practical to a more abstract.  He also developed all his indicators and systems, a system being a simple entry into a given market and not his entire methodology, are primitive and simple, yet they help understand how the market is behaving in the present moment using non-linear dynamics and chaos theory.  This means that when I am in a trade, I know exactly what is happening in the market on multiple dimensions related to crowd psychology (fractals) to information and energy dynamics to finally price action.  He even explains in "New Trading Dimensions" how price moves in relation to the balance line measuring the flow of information and its speed.  Bill Williams to me is standing on the shoulders of some of the greatest market technicians in history.  Furthermore, just reading the books by Bill Williams will not be enough.  You need to learn money management and Elliot Wave.  For money management I recommend "The Mathematics of Money Management" by Ralph Vince.  Also, study thoroughly as much of Robert Prector's materials, but also Robert Bain.  Also, it might help to study Steve Nison for Candle Sticks Education.  Bottom-Line:  Bill Williams has developed one of the few methodologies and insightful contribution to trading the markets than few today.  This should be apparent from the first reading of Chaos Theory 1st Edition.  If you don't think that Non-Linear Dynamics and Chaos Theory are inherent in human behavior as well as all natural phenomena then you need to visit the library and study some of the recent literature on quantum physics and non-linear mathematics, then you will see that we have come a long way.

Hello!

Nice post there buddy! I agree with almost all of what you said! Nice summary. We tend to forget that trading is 90% mental.

just out of curiosity, please tell me some one is atleast 10 contracts long on NZD/USD. It would give me extreme pleasure if I see at least one persons chart who's traded this H4 trend using at least one dimension of entries. Unfortunately I'm left to the world of "I wish, coulda, woulda, shoulda,...." LOL

please some one! I will donate 10, 1 Lot pips to charity if I see anyone who's loaded with either any Yen H4 or NZD/USD or NZD/JPY..

cheers

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
May I interrupt your discussion please to ask a question..?

I would like to know the time frame that seems to be preferred by you traders, I think Mr Williams uses a daily chart for a lot of his work, I am just wondering what you are using.

Thanks so much

daveM

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Thank you for the question and I think it's very important one for those new to forex, I'm not aware of your experience but I thought I'll add my Humble opinion here. I believe no time frame  is better or lesser than other however there are some peculiarities of every Time Frame. One has to consider the following factors

1. Your life style, ie do you work or not hiw long are u available erc

2. Your patience level

3. account size

These are main points there are others too so it's a decision you must take and decide what tf your more comfortable with

Personally, I trade from h4 down to even m1

Cheers

Would the arrow on this pic represent the 'saddle' to be bracketed with orders.?

Seems price is between the lines and they are confused.....

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
Saddle point is created using 1 sleeping alligator 2 ao flat at zl 3 ac flat at zl

However I use only 1 n 2

So yes this almost sleepy ali but I don't know ie cant say , whether it's a saddle

Regards

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
New to this method, I find those indicators to be excellent. I was able to make three profitable trades earlier in the day just by bracketing some narrow ranges that I thought looked like saddles(they probably were not saddles, LOL)

I have always avoided EW, I can see now that it will be most useful.

Thanks for the help.!!

Excellent video on the blog.....  Just as I am saying I need to learn about the wave..... I see the video and it does a great job...

Hey  Dave

Its great to know that you're already having fun with it. Remember one thing, our overall long term profit does not come from a higher %age of win ratio. The secret is letting the winners run. I know the question, most asked, how do we do that. I can assure you using this technique you might be getting around 50% losers. but your winners are going to be much larger. In fact so large that you wont care about those "Rents" that you might pay while living in "low rent district" zone. (saddle point)

Earlier I replied to your question using my phone, looking at it again, its a spot where I would most definitely go long.

The Video

Thank you for your comments on the video. It was not done with any such preparation at all. We were just going to have talk a casual one.  One of our friends, (M) said why not record this session so we can repeat it, "repetition being the mother of learning" so I said why not lets do it. But when it was over I really liked what i said, haha. I was like, "aha, I can listen to myself and teach myself while I'm having a down time". Trust me it happens. e.g. during July - Dec 2010 I was proper in the zone. I quadrupled my account. Then I lost it. No no not my account, the zone.  I was not able to be as profitable as I was. I was in, what Bill calls "in the hole". And its true once in a while you would find yourself in it. And the way to get out of it is something that I might discuss on my blog or here some other time. But once you're in the zone, you do things that you dont know how you do, when others ask you how you do it, you're usual response would be "I dont know". This could also bring negative energies from others who have no idea of being "in or out the zone". which is why forums could be a very dangerous place to express views. it is for this reason i believe forums is either for beginners or strong believers ie consistently successful. The ones who just find their path must go away and put in to practice, act on the newly found wisdom. Become believers. Later they can come back and give back what the universe gave them. this is also true that the process of taking precedes giving (ie. in larger proportions) but give you must. for giving is what brings more to you.

Moreover, if you've got AIMS Levels V.2 on your chart which I can see you have, you dont need the fractal arrows. The whole purpose of AIMS Levels indicator is clear the clutter of up and down arrows. You might wanna get rid of them unless you're onto something else that. Just my opinion

I hope everyone's having a blast!

cheers

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
I did remove the arrows and I modified the background of the chart a bit so that I could see the indicator a little more clearly. and now the clutter is gone..

YES, I am having fun with it....!

I made a little ea so that I can play the bars again on different charts..... I like to do replay with any system so that I can test my knowledge and skill.

If someone wants the little EA I will post it here. for sure it is nothing miraculous, just a tool to help me learn.

Happy Easter, everyone...!

Yousafzai,

congratulations on your blog, this might compliment my trading strategies very well, and I can resonate with your words about trading mind and being in a " zone ".

Short question :

Regarding the 2 books by B./Justine Williams on your site : which one would you recommend ? As far as I know one of them, " Trading Chaos ", was the first one, but is it still valid for today`s market environment ?

What is your experience ? Thank you !

Dave Michael greenriver

Thanks

I would recommend reading both they compliment each other

Though markets change behaving frequently the underlying structure remains almost the same because it takes a relatively longer time to change

Note that I have not mentioned reading 2nd edition of trading chaos

I believe forex markets are perfect for trend following still

Regards and thanks for your kind words and visiting my blog

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Thank you, very helpful. I`ll read both books. Great video, just watched it - you have a natural ability to teach.

I must admit that breaking down the EW stuff and looking at AO for clues is a huge step towards taking out the guess work.

I have the impression that this way of trading has either been misunderstood or underestimated by most traders....

a) not reading the books

b) failing to understand the combination of all tools.

I hope to contribute more soon.

hello all Traders, gload to salute you.

recently i was reading the Book Trading Chaos Ed 2.

i would like to share my entries, mostly to improve my technics, i had some good trades before, but have the need to improve this strategy, maybe you can help me as i can help you with my succees or mistakes.

i have a mini account only 500US$ so far. and not rushing to make full profit, wanna be a least at level one where no lost are while adquiring experience.

Here is an Eu/Us M5 chart where i pretend to take a sell position based on the Wise Man 1 signal.

here is what i wonder...

1. Has  a good angulation?

2. are well drew my angles?

3. as you can see AC and AO both are showing signals, should i set another 2 sell orders even if i dont see profits yet?

4. few minutes after Segond Wise Man appears, shoul i set another sell order?

5. where should i set my stop lost ? is ok where it is , one tick above the last buy fractal?

6. should i use take profit or only trail stops losts?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
here is how is developing today EU/US in M5 chart,

as you can see more signals presented, 1 buy fractal and 2 sell fractal, i set and pending buy stop order just above the buy fractal as it is avobe red balance line, i am not sure if i set another sell stop bellow the sell fractal.

AO is still red, but AC is turning green.

i am realy not sure about these trades.

few minutes later the buy order was trigger. now i have 2 contracts, 1 sell and 1 buy.

thanks in advance for your comments.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
the trade continuation:

as the price hit down the sell fractal, AC and AO was red, i decided to close the buy order and set another sell order, hopes all goes ok.

i woul like some advice for these cases.

thanks in advance and best regards

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Hi jgimenez76,

After a very short look on your charts, because is very late in my tim zone, this is my opinion, with good chances to be uncomplete:

- TC2 is about entering in the market soon, right after a trend is over. In your case: uptrend is over, Ao is still green, you enter the market short under the low of the divergence bar, SL 1-2 pips higher then the same pricebar.

From this moment all your orders must be short.

- You are still above red line but you are expecting the price heading down , so don't go long.

- Lines for the angle must be drawn from the point where the price intersects the red line.

- Second signal: three red bars on the AO, you must enter the next pricebar, but only short.

- You take all the down fractals, but only the down fractals.then you will not have 1 long and 1 short order in the same time.

- Because you never know how much the market will give you (B.W.), don't use TP, just trail manually, at the top of the highest 3 or 5 bars of the same colour.

Bye,

K. Cs.

Hi

thank you for joining us in this lovely Chaos! Since you've asked for our opinion I'd like to thank you and take this opportunity to express what I think would be the right approach.

I personally believe the market has a definite structure. that structure is EW. Every currency, stock, commodity has its own peculiar character as well. Every time frame is essentially the same still a bit different. its like the structure of the human body, we are all essentially the same yet different.

Having said that, all markets trend. if not one TIMe Frame they must trend on a differnt time frame. If they did not then the structure of the market would have changed. it can change but so far, for the past 100 years or so all the graphs/charts are still behaving iin almost similar fashion. Many people think that Bill Williams first 2 books are too old hence they might have expired or run out or something.

I consider them as the Law of Gravity. We cannot say this law is too old now and we need to have something new. It applies exactly as it applied 1000 years ago. etc etc. The structure of the market is Elliott Wave. That structure can be traded using the incredible AO indicator. I believe one can trade only this indicator, just like Bill Williams mentions in his book.

In the third book they taught us how to trade reversals. it did not mean they put an end to trend trading. In their most recent interview they said they are most certainly trend traders but they also have a good mechanism to trade reversals as well. I believe reversals is for experts who'd traded trending markets for decades.

Having said all that, i cannot comment further but I'd like to share below what my understanding of "angulation" is.

ps: think about, the blue line is where price will be when there is no new incoming information. When price goes too fast, too far away from Balance Line i.e Blue line , the rubber band principle come into force. price comes back to it like magic.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Hi  i really apreciate your answer, this clarified more this strategy, to me,

what you mean with TC2 ?

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
yousafzai, i will take your advice not take WM3 signal yet, but take it as a alert to my first entry based on WM2  really apreciate your answer.

i must to say that last trade was a disaster, hope this goes ok

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Hello all trade this is my next attemp for a profitable trade based on this strategy.

Chart is M5 Eu/Us.

I did not take signal based on WM3, still waiting for the second entry based on WM2 and the Buy Fractal above Alligator' Teeth.

So, 2 Buy Stops pending orders at set.

Here my few doubts:

1. High of the Bar where WM2 appears is 1,48077, my Buy stop at 1,48087.

2. Buy Fractal value is 1,48117, so i set Buy Stop at 1,48127, one Tick above, is ok? or i misundertand what one Tick above means?

3. Where my Buy Stops's Stop Lost will be?

a. Bellow Low WM1 ?

b. Bellow Low of WM2 and Bello Low of Buy Fractal respectively.

3. somewhere else...

4. Should i place a Sell Stop bellow WM3 as is the last fractal bellow Red Line ?

Thanks in advace and wish you a very profitable trades.

TC2 = Trading Chaos 2 (second edition)

there is a big difference between the two editions.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
I think what you are trying to trade is maybe a correction, than a change in the trend. Alligator seems to go to sleep.

However, if your buy stops will be reached, there is a possibility for the market to go upwards.

1,2, I think that 1or 2 ticks above/bellow the bar at Bill Williams means a bit higher or just above, or something like this. He is talking about 1 tick on aday chart and you have a 5m chart, and 5 numbers after 0, so can be less than 10 pips.

sl - B.W. says in Trading Chaos 2 that SL should be the high/low of 3 or 5 bars of the same colour. In New Trading Dimensions he gives a few other possibilities depending on the evolution of the price, and the guts of the trader .

Your question from the chart: more buy stops above the green bars?

- First of all you had to wait to confirm that the market is going upward: 3 green bars on the AO, then

- you were anyway under the red line of the alligator

- in order to open new positions, there are three conditions: AO green, AC green, price green

ps.: what are you using the pink line for?

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
thanks i should suppose =)

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
very much thanks for ur response

sererals bars afterwards, is confirmed what you said, the alligator was going to sleep, affortunally i could close my 2 position without loses, with minimal profit, this is the kind of experience i am looking for.

about the Ticks? so is there any way to calcuculates?, i thought was talking about 1 Pip, i wonder if is the price change, but how i can know that number, sometimes i see the buy or sell order is reached and inmediatily goes to the opposite direction, is like is better to do exactly the opposite transaction. could be this becouse the pending order is too close the high/low of the bar?.

about the SL, i got frustrated sometimes i got kicked from market after SL is hitted and then prices goes again to profit.

about adding positon , thanks for clarifications=))

the pink lines are explained in the first posts of this thread it suppose to help to places SL, but as is not part of BW, i am not experiment with it yet.

Now that the Alligator is sleeping several buy fractals appears in the chart, i will try my next attempt, hopes got something good before weekend =) (first picture)

In USD/CAD looks like i made same mistake than before, alligator was going to sleep again, my Order was hitted but the the lines got closer over time, hopes not get in this trap again. (second picture)

After this i think once the alligator is sleeping one has to take the change to set pending orders, i know this is very clear in the book, but i my lack of experience made me not to see before. Hopes it helps other traders.

My Best Regards and Wishes.

sometimes  5 minute chart can take your money, especially in a period when the market is slow.

We have to know that minute charts are printed even if there is little volume.... caution.!

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Slope

The best entries, other than the saddle, come when there is a very steep slope on the green line of the alligator.

If the trend is not there, entries when the alligator mouth is opening are not going to be very productive and may just expose your trade to chop.

I suggest checking the trend on higher time frame and if it is not pronounced. best to go for a coffee instead of risking money.

IMHO

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
I think any time frame can do the same, but a "faster time frame" would take you up or down faster. A setup is a setup is a setup. It does not matter what Time frame, if its a setup, (yes, true enough volume is required, hence trade London Open, New York and/or Asian Open.) IMHO>

Using yousafzai indis on 1 min chart

Here is my chart of open UJ trade as I am trying to work out details of trading 1 min charts and managing trade from there.   Initial target is 2.618 fib as a guide near 80.30  but watching 200 level and a fifth wave move with divergence on the AO and a close above the red line.  The added color on the AO does make for faster visual. Always worth working on BW's method.

Comments welcome and good luck to everyone.

Sorry text in pic is cropped.  Says "stay short till 5th wave and candle close above red line" and Ao to zero to meet cond of 4th wave"

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
new screen shots as trade is progressing.  wait for close on 1 minute chart.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Just saw your post! sorry for the delay been busy with myself!

This is excellent stuff. Staying through entire sequence of 1-5 on M1 would allow you to stay through a possible 3rd wave of M5, starting from the very top to the very bottom of a given impulse/third wave.  It become daunting experience every now and then when the 4th wave retraces too much. But for that I use two fractal behind (at least I try to do it) SL. That usually keeps me in the trade for longer. I discuss Principle C in my blog. The purpose of that page is to explain why we should and can stay in during Principle C (ZigZag Retrace) and how AIMS helps highlight it visually making it easier to identify. Briefly if you are in an Impulse wave on M5 (or any TF of your choice) at some point that 3rd / impulse wave must have a 4th wave. We dont want to exit on this 4th wave. But how do we know when we are wrong? Simple, trail SL 2 fractals behind. But then again it ALL depends on our Belief System.

Kind Regards

Many pips to everyone!

Hi Yousafzai,

I entered about the same place, on a down fractal on the 5M chart.

Even tough I would have other opportunities to enter, I decided not to do so, because of the late hours.

I am still in the market, with a trailing stop (unusual for this strategy :-)), and a sure 32 pips green.

EU is still range bound on the H4/H1 chart. However it did provide a  nice short during Asian session. I woke up to what many call choppy  period. Hence I started waiting for that right moment. When the setup is  just right. Finally AO was close to ZL and Alligator lines inter  twined. Meaning get ready. A sleeping alligator and an AO Close to zero line means we are about to be in business. It was a setup on M1 as well. But following my rules of not  trading m1 if M5 is at a saddle point I put pending on M5 level. Later  added on at the peak of 3rd wave on m1 chart and exited on what I  thought was a completed 1-5. (time will tell.) Note that 5th wave could  not be confirmed on AO since its peak is higher than previous but I  believe that is because we dont have sufficient number of bars on AO. we  need at least 100 bars whereas at this point we have only 65 or so.

Hello, I am new to this group. I read Bill Williams books ages ago, most recently the latest book (changing to 3 wisemans setup), reading through this group lately and last but not least started trading. So far not much luck I admit.

This morning I did the following (see picture), basically in line with what I read here and reading through the itradeAIMS-blog: the alligator lines were all together. the higher level (15 min) had an open alligator mouth I  did not select a too close fractal but the one I marked

I finally get filled.

It went my direction and I added on at the next fractal.

Then market turned around and I closed the trade with loss at first close about the red line.

What did i do wrong? Was my setup ok ?

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
I'd like to comment but I have no idea what pair and time frame is it? secondly are you not using AO?

Anyhow, by the looks of it, without looking at AO I could see some kind of peak of AO before you went short. I am sure you traded into a 4th wave. IMHO.

without looking it up on my platform i'm not sure what to say but there is one point I must state is that even if you traded into 4th wave or may be not pic a correct setup, if it went against you and you paid a bit of rent so what. its gonna happen to you more often than you think. We close for loss many a times yet when we hit a trending market with a few add ons it covers everything. e.g last night Asian open was a perfect saddle point on m5 and m15. on h1 it was showing possibility of a 5th wave. Bracketing a saddle point is the name of the game if you can wait for it.

cheers many pip to you

Hello,

oh, yes. To be complete, here the context:

http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/1...8may312054.jpg

I see AO close to ZL, a peak earlier (W3?), followed by a smaller peak (W5?) preceeded by a dip below ZL (W4?) and it seems I wanted to get short catching a correction instead of another trend

You are right, I cannot expect to win every set-up. So far, I admit, my results are not great.

I do not have an account yet with a FX broker. I trade via my bank using knock-out coupons and pay 2pips spread plus 20 EUR a round turn.

Which means I need 10 pips just to be break even with my lot size.  Looking at my current losses, a big part is actually transaction fees.

On top, from 10:00 pm till 08:00 CET I cannot trade with this account, or take a high risk of an overnigh position with hands bound.

That is - I think - what I have to optimise in finding a broker I only pay spread and can trade around the clock.

But of course I wanted to see if at all I can handle trading. As well psychologically, which really is a thing.... reading books and then actually get on the floor is two pair of shoes....

But I dont want to give up. Since I read BW first book in 95 I felt that this approach is something for me (and I read loads of books).

So enough the whining. This is no morning pages forum

I try to plan my next deal carefully ,,,,

Cheers & good trades,

Thomas

Next try:

I see a range which could be W2 ?  In that range the alligator mouth is closed. AO comes up through ZL.

I saw it late (so did not fetch it at break out fractal) and went long around where I placed that arrow. The horizontal line is my SL which corresponds to the down fractal.

Will go to a fairground with my daughter,,,,, let´s see later. Fingers crossed.

Cheers,

T.

if there is one person here who's followed the Morning Pages advice I'd celebrate. Morning pages changed my life. Everyone should do it. cheers!

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Its Looking very good now!

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
So far so good

I came home and it was almost at the end of W4. I decided to not sell in panic but hold through W5. But then I sold when the W3 level was reached.

After many losses I had, I wanted to play save. And I did good, as W5 did not go well beyond W3.

What a good feeling I was with the flow once!

This morning pages excercise really was good for you? I tried it but for 3 days in a row I had the same things to write down.... and gave up. Maybe I should read this book BW refers to...

Cheers,  T.

The Fear of Trading: The left brain

Our concious brain is what creates our physical experience of life. As a survival mechanism the concious mind always looks at the darker side of life. It looks for potential problems, so it could formulate potential solutions. It wants to one step ahead of time. Since, with every trade comes the possibility of losing the lefty always looks at the half empty glass, the negative side, the problem side.

Morning pages helps with taming down the left brain, our survival mechanism. with a strategy that could easily give you 60% losers one really needs to tame Mr. left brain down a bit. To be able to look at the bright side of the picture morning pages helps a great deal. I dont know how and what happens during morning pages but doing them absolutely eases my mind. It helps with concentration and staying in the "Now". In the words of the Great BW, "it certainly helps me get to the other side".

Another thing that is useful is "Autogenic Training". For Further details I'd recommend reading the books and visiting www.profitunity.com.

Auto-suggestion and Self-hypnosis technique.

At the end of each tape in Profitunity Home Study Course Bill Williams reminds of completing The Morning pages. in fact I'd like to quote a very important bit about the importance of 3 pages/morning pages from the book, Trading Chaos 2nd Edition,p163

"This commitment is so essential that if you are not willing to make this a serious commitment, even more important that the last 30 minute of sleep in the morning, I strongly suggest that you quit right now. There is no compulsion fro you to do this program. You well may choose to go on living your life and trading that way you have always traded.  It is your life and you should make this choice."
(in a way, he is suggesting that to trade chaos, to trade differently  then you traded before and to be able to follow his technique, you must  take this on board. He gives us no choices its a yes or no)
You can see how strong this statement is.

He also says that in almost all the cases where people would fail to become successful even after attending tutorial and/or completing home study course the reason they find is that they dont do the morning pages. It is this important. I hope I understand what is written above first and foremost and the rest of us Profitunity Traders.

Starting a few affirmative statements every morning is a best practice.

All the best,

We create our own reality.

cheers

Hey there!

Quite new to the Chaos Trading strategy, but I have now read through all the three books by Williams and must say his strategy seems worth the commitment. I'll join the thread with examples of my own charts and trades. Two questions before I begin:

1- How do you calculate the position size and stop loss of all the Add Ons. The initial stop loss and position size is easy, but I have some doubts about how to position stop loss and position size when it comes to all the add on signals (I mainly use the add ons from the second book "New Trading Dimensions"). Any suggestions?

2- How exactly do you do these morning pages. Is there any particular set of rules when writing them or can they be considered a 3 pages brain storming to be done every morning?

I have attached my AUD USD daily trade. As you can see it just got triggered. I used the strategy from the the New Trading Dimensions book which is my favorite. To avoid whiplashes I wait for a confirmation candle to break the fractal and then I place a stop order above/below the high/low of this confirmation bar instead. This way I avoid a lot of false signals. You can see this entry strategy of mine in the trade I attached. Please feel free to comment.

Good Trading

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Here's an update on my previous AUD/USD trade. After the weekend the market is against me, but still hasn't stopped me out according to my Risk Management protocols. Could be that I entered the market a bit early as the market could still be ranging which will make for a strong trend soon. If I get stopped out I'll stop and reverse the same way I entered the market in the first place. If the market goes my way there's already an Addon waiting to be triggered. This Addon was generated by the AO oscillator crossing the zero line, but could also have bene a Fractal sell signal or a Balance Line Sell signal. Of course we don't addon three times on the same bar so we choose one signal and make only one addon each time. I'll keep you updated! Good Trading!

I am curious about the timing of when the best time is to write the pages. I would like to know if any effectiveness is lost if I was to write the pages (along with a cup of coffee) when I got to the office in the morning vs writing when you first wake up?

It's always a bit of a rush to get going and get to work, but I would like to know if there is a significant impact of writing when first waking up vs writing when at work before the work day starts. It is actually fairly quiet when I get in and I have my own office in the Company....so just curious.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Hi

Well this is a lifetime commitment. He clearly says you gotta do thsi first thing in the morning before you even get out of bed. But of course not everyone will be able to do it that way. e.g. I have 2 kids, they wont let me have that quite. so I have to either get very very early before the disaster time or else I have to wait for them to settle down. In any case its better than not doing. I'd say give it a 30 day, if it helps, And I'm sure it will, if you have a quite office to yourself and are able to spend those extra 15-30min, why the hell not. Give it a shot!  But he clearly states if you cannot spare this extra time and sacrifice that extra 30min of sleep that you might as well live the way you live before.......

But i think it will work anyway!

cheers

pst: i've even done em sitting on my trading desk, talk about discipline aye!!!

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Morning pages seem very interesting! I'll tray them out myself as soon as possible! Apart from that here's the last update on my AUD/USD trade:

My second entry signal got triggered yesterday, but due to mixed economic news and the pair failing to take up speed I decided to exit the whole trade with a small profit on both the triggered signals. I might consider reentering on the break of the fractal to the downside if I see enough force in the move.For now I'll stay out on this one.

http://i1190.photobucket.com/albums/...sdupdate02.gif

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
LOL! I have the same issue, two monsters that are up the moment I am, regardless of time. So actual first peace and quiet is in the office. I was actually doing at work for a bit, but will take it up again. Oddly enough, even though I was sometimes writing incoherently, it did seem to help. I will try again at work here, and see how things progress, then see if I can move it back to home eventually. I just wanted to see if there would be a material impact by waiting that hour or so from getting up to getting to work and starting to write vs getting up and writing.

The best way to trade is to trade simple. We  have so many opinions/thoughts about so many things, and opinions and thoughts are what form our beliefs. Bill Williams' say "no one trades the market, everyone trades their individual belief system". Its one thing to understand, and one important thing to understand, that the market has a structure, that the structure of the market can be found (i.e. of course the Elliott Wave) and that the structure also has a structure (i.e Fractals for which I use my AIMS Levels indicator) and quite another thing to act upon that understanding.

"Between stimulus (what the indicators on our charts tell us, and of which Price itself is the prime indicator of market)  is our freedom to choose. "

(Stephen R Covey).

That choice need to be exercised and one needs learn to take full responsibility for it. If you knew how to trade the market using a certain proven strategy you'd benefit even more if you have a mechanism to automate the parts that could be automated. Something that makes the simple things simpler.

Obviously the market being a product of chaos generates chaos data and cannot be analysed using set patterns (linear mathematics/geometry techniques), however there are certain bits that we could automate. I was working on something like this and I have now managed something really interesting. Once I'm done with my 1-2 hours extreme M1 trading I can sit back and relax and wait if there is an Entry Alert. Its not the holy grail but its no less. If you were to be alerted just before the market was about to take off and alerted back when the trend was just about to end wouldn't that be great? I think I've got the answer. I'll share the answer in the form of pictures of my recent trades.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
Interesting, how is it on 15 M or 1 H charts? Does it use fractals also? Will it be available soon? I already have the AIMS setup (paid for) thanks, Cal

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
I re-read this comment and would like to add. Using Wiseman technique is not , yes NOT just reversal technique. you have to understand the structure of the market. Once you know that, a little bit of knowledge of Elliott Wave, a bit about how to use AO to count the waves and a bit about Wiseman 1 and angulation. (that rather sounds quite a few bits but still ... LOL) you will find Wiseman technique very useful. Its not just reversal for the sake of reversals it is a way to get into possible trends ahead of time. specially useful for getting into a 3rd wave at the bottom of wave 2. Oh yes, this is the best use of it. and then at the bottom of wave 4 into 5th wave. and then at the end of 5th into a possible new trend. I'm still learning! which is exciting to know! cheers

I Trade 8 pairs on H1. All I need is a dot alert and analyse chart in 10 seconds. I used to check pairs every hour. Now I check them only when I get an alert. Play got easier... However one can analyse H1 chart any hour. it would take 2mintues to check 10 charts. If you dont spot a setup in 2 minutes, there is no setup. If you spend further 5 minutes you might find one, beware the lefty!

Hi guys, first post here on FF, been trading for awhile but still an amateur. I think this CHAOS system is the best.

Do you take other parameters into consideration when taking trades? For instance, on the chart you can see that I watch for breakouts of the Asian session range, signals during my trading day (Europe open to London close), break of previous day's low, really came together today, need to catch these for REAL

Hi yousafzai,

Your strategy is looking really nice. About your indicators like AIMS. Is it possible to get them?

I've a question about how you count the waves. Bill Williams wrote that we should have 100 to 150 bars in the current trade to be able to identify wave 4 as the AO is passing on the other side of the 0-line. Are you doing that too?

If I understand well your strategy we enter a trade when:

1) Alligator is sleeping

2) There is a breakout of the AIMS zone (fractal breakout)

3) AO is around 0 and crossing the 0-line in the breakout direction.

Is that right? Do you have any other conditions or rules?

What are the dots on the charts? What is the setup 2? a fractal breakout as addon to the trade?

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Hi

It seems you are quite eager to know how it works. Good signs.

I have 3 rules for both of my setups.  You understood them well my friend.

Setup 1 is sleeping alligator setup.

Setup 2.  is for

Open Alligator.

It happens in two places, one, just after Setup 1 breaks out, it would create that first fractal out of alligators mouth, check the 3 ruels for Open alligator and go for it, many times you should already be in the trade using setup 1, so you get perfect add on. secondly comes when price quickly turns around, alligator does not sleep and opens to the other side. Now here I would use my higher time frame analysis, if it turns around as still against atleast 5X time frame i will not take it, if however, price was sideways even on 5x time frame i would take it. for this i use th purple line and for that i have not yet shared my settings. i will at a later time. meanwhile thank you for liking my system (derived from Bill William's Of course)

cheers

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Really great looking system. I'll test it for a while :-)

Ty yousafzai!

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
Hi,

I've created a small indicator to help finding Wave 4. As Bill Williams wrote in his book, the wave we are analyzing should contain between 100 and 140 bars to have a valid reading on the AO indicator.

Add the indicator in attachment in a chart and put a vertical bar at the beginning of the move and name it "Bar1". Put an other vertical bar at the end of the move and name it "Bar2". The two parameter of the indicator are not used. You can ignore them.

The values to be set on the MACD indicator will appear at the top left of the chart.

Add the MACD indicator to the chart and set its slow and fast periods and you have a accurate way to locate or wait for Wave 4.

If the move contains 50 bars for example, it will adapt the slow and fast periods to be used to help locate Wave 4.

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Can you post some pictures to demonstrate what you are talking about?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
I would like to create an indicator thta will alert me when there is a fractal breakout and the alligator is sleeping.

Actually, to determine if the alligator is sleeping, I'm checking if during the 15 last bars, there is a bar for which the three alligator lines are not in the correct order (green red blue or blue red green).

For example if on the 5th bar before the last one, if the green line is between the red and blue lines, I consider that the alligator is sleeping.

Has anybody a better idea on how to determine if the alligator is sleeping? And something easy to code ;-)

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Believe it or not, that has already been done.   ZL on AO  = sleeping.

Compare the Alligator vs AO when its at Zero line

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Wwoooww! Easy!!!

Thank you almo :-)

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
This is all been done!

Blue line is roughly the AO itself.!!

I saw there are a lot of EA for trading Chaos, but it is always said that they are no profitable. Does that mean that Trading Chaos is no more working in today's market?

The rules are pretty clear and if we can be successful when using this strategy manually, it should be possible to have good results with an EA.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
Daniel!

I'm going to put some effort in this. Its not a tug war or something. I have done my morning trading and sitting tight on my profits for now. So I thought I'd review the book quickly and quote something realy meaning ful out of it. I hope you enjoy it. you will see that I have given it fair amount of time, so I hope you read it and I hope this would answer your query. cheers

What is? and what is the the difference between "Linear mathematics/geometry" and "Fractal (non-linear) geometry" and science of chaos. ?

I quote something from Trading Chaos,

""laws" of triangles is that "the interior angles of

any triangle will always total 180 degrees, no matter what the

shape of the triangle." That is true, but 'only' in the gravitational

field of the earth. As a spaceship leaves the earth's gravitational

field on its way to the moon, the total becomes more

than 180 degrees because of the curvature of space." ...

the law of triangles is a specific

truth and not a universal truth. That concept will become extremely

important as we do an in-depth study of our market

maps. ...

Einstein left us with only

one constant-the speed of light. Quantum mechanics took

that away. (my comment: Because now we believe that there could be many different things that could go much faster then light)

The science of

chaos gives us a new and more appropriate paradigm (map) to

view the world, the markets, and our personal behaviour....

Chaos does not refer to randomness; just the opposite is

true. Chaos is a higher form of order where randomness and

stimuli become the organizing principle rather than the more

traditional "cause and effect"

The

normal

distribution

stands out in the

experience of humankind

as one of the broadest generalizations

of natural science. It has been used as a

trading instrument in the markets, in the physical

and social sciences, and in medicine, agriculture, and

engineering. It is an indispensable tool for the analysis and

the interpretation of the basic data gathered by observation.

....

Because the markets are a non-linear, turbulent system produced

by the interaction of human beings, price and time actions

are the perfect places to seek fractal structures.

The primary purpose of this book is to show you how to

trade using fractal geometry. Twelve years of intensive research

have been dedicated to the fractal geometry of the markets...

Mandelbrot set. This may very well be the keystone that connects

Fibonacci numbers, the Elliott wave, and fractals into one

coherent paradigm.

In our own original research, the Profitunity Trading

Group has discovered several repeating patterns that allow a

degree of predictability about future market movements that

are quantum leaps ahead of the accepted current technical

analysis.

The fractal is also a measure of irregularity. The more irregular

and choppy a market is, the larger will be its fractal

number. The fractal number of a portion of a move will always

peak at the turnaround point. Therefore, all market trend

changes are accompanied by a higher fractal number than the

bars leading up to the change in trend.

(my comment: The distance between upper and lower AIMS levels is deep/high during choppy periods)

Most novice traders search for a
mechanical system that will make them rich and successful if

they can just put the pieces of the market puzzle together....

the market is designed to destroy any successful mechanical

system. All mechanical systems die! They are linear tools and cannot

accurately or adequately describe a non-linear market.

Conclusion:
1. linear trading systems are unsuccessful in describing and capturing profits from the market.
2. EA is a linear tool, and coded with "mechanical system". It dies.

lastly, have you ever met an EA millionaire? (may some one out there, there is one, but I have not met one yet)

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
But I don't understand. The rules in the book "New trading Dimensions" are clear. Whatever we do, trading manually or using an EA, sshould give the same result! What would you do manually that an EA base on that strategy would not do? There is no filtering rules for trend direction on higher timeframe or anything like that.

Even an EA should be better than when trading manually. It can close all orders in 1 or 2 seconds.

This strategy, even traded manually is like a linear trading system.

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
Daniel

I understand your point. EA just cannot handle the human "intuition" bit.

EA cannot do "morning pages" and get inspiration.

EA cannot get you to the level of "competent trader" and it cannot

help you achieve the state of

"knowing without knowing how you know".

it was somewhere earlier in this thread we talked about EA. But I'll repeat one thing, "The right brain and the subconscious has a dormant EA. The symbol stays  . By doing AT and Morning pages (mind exercises) one can turn the symbol to  and let it do its thing".

Its the 4th and 5th level of trading. "where you know without knowing how you know". because you trade based on EA inside your "mind" connect the source of "chaos".

please ignore me if I sound a nut-case!

but if you insist i have the following ideas:

Entry Exit and MM based on AIMS levels. with rule for

AIMS break above/below  Red line or all three. etc.

cheers

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
But could you give me an example on a chart, where all the conditions are filled to enter a trade, but you're not doing, because of your intuition or the morning pages execercies? On my side, I would take any signal, except if there are some news coming soon and I'm trading in a low timeframe. It seems like intuition is going against the saying "Wants what the market wants".

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
No its not, when your "underlying structure" is in tune with that "underlying structure" of the market. You want what "chaos" wants.

Market is a product of Chaos (natural phenomena)

Humans a product of chaos, (natural phenomena)

Everything is energy

All that is around us and within originates from "singular source of energy"

Stuff comes from non stuff (quantum mechanics)

Human (we) connected to "source energy/god/universe/inner self/higher"

Market connected to "source energy/god/universe/inner self/higher self" (several names pointing to similar "universal fact")

When we are connected to source energy (in tune/ in the zone)

intuition, the pure knowledge that comes from the same source energy,

that created us too as well as our thoughts and markets leads towards

the right path. and hence we are one with the market and

"we want what the market wants".

our ultimate goal is to arrive at the "vituoso" level of trading.

"its a trance-ending experience"

cheers and kind regards

Perhaps rules for Setup 1 and Setup 2 could be used but its "subjective" and I dont know how to fit them.... give me ideas...what do you think?

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
Your rules 1 and 2 are all fine and the conditions are clear I think. For example for entry 1, alligator must be sleeping and there must be a valid fractal breakout and the AO should have crossed the 0-line is the direction of the breakout.

I looks pretty clear, but when you see that on a chart, do you always enter a trade or sometime your intuition is telling you not to do? As I said, on my side, except if there is some news coming and I'm in a small timeframe (< 15min), I would not enter a trade.

I'm not sure I understand , which idea you're looking for :-|

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
News rules

No trading just before news. and at news time.

just after if it sets up and depending on news and how it behaves.

When in trade and profitable by big margin, could sometime give it a chance may be u get even bigger winner. but not recommended.

Intuition has a BIG part in my trading. I believe it is sharper and sharper the more I do my MP's and IT.

cheers

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
I think I'll try to do those MP's. I've never given much interest to them so far :-(

I explained wrong about the news, but you understood right :-)

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
This is because we are all connected and we understand each other as long as we "choose" to accept and understand each other. IMHO.

Its coincidence or what?

in my blog, before you ask the question I posted the following:

"To Choose to Choose or not to choose"

I'd like to quote something very important here.

"The market will always be a reflection of you"....

"if you are not having fun trading, you are doing it all wrong"....

"most important choice in the world is ,'either to choose to choose or not to choose'"

If you choose to follow a mechanical system you have not really chosen to trade the market.

and all mechanical systems will fail. You need to see through your need to be dependent on others.
"Your true nature is all you need. "

Let it show you what you do not need.

Listen quietly for a moment. Everything can change right now. Learning  to hear this supreme secret is no more difficult than to "choosing"  whether to swimming against the current or to let it carry you safely down stream. Let the secret speak to that secret part inside of you. Listen to it now. It is showing you

Hi, have anybody ordered Bill Williams' newest home course - is it of real value ? I mean is all theory touched much deeper than in latest book or it's repeat of the book ?

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
I've a question about the divergent bar. What do we do if we are long and there is a bearish divergent bar and the price breaks below the low of that bar? Should we stop and reverse?

Nothing is explained in the book about that?

Anybody has the 2nd version of the home study course explaining the method with the 3 wisemans? Which stop are they using? Only the 3 or 5 bars back?

Justine Williams told me that in their course, the AO signal is no more taken before we have at least a fractal entry.

And about pyramiding? Is there some more details about that? Should we pyramid if our orders are currently not in profit? If I have an open order already, and there is a new fractal breakout and my order is in profit, isn't dangerous to buy 5 or 4 lots on that one. Not every trade will give up to 5 or more signals and if we have 1 lot for the first order and 5 for the second one, then if it reverses we will have a strong losing trade. Any informations about that?

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
Regarding divergent bars, these are only important for the (possible) start of a new position trading cycle. When you are already holding positions (thanks to reverse pyramiding) you would NOT reverse those, but wait till they are stopped out - most probably in the next bar. So you will close at least 6 units. And you might place a pending order for the next cycle -starting with 1 unit only!!!!

This is my understanding of TC2ndEd -

Regards

Forex37

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
unfortunately I have to disagree - purely using logic you have to stop and reverse on valid divergent bar( for validity I developed my own strategy).

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
The course has real value in that it covers in a whole different level of depth the material presented in the book. It is designed to break down the concepts and slow down your learning process to the point where you have an opportunity to really think about what Bill and Justine say in their books. There are also some minor tweaks to some of the techniques presented in the books as something has changed over the years but this is really something minor and not where the real value is. I would recommend the course unless you felt that all the material of TC2 is completely understood and mastered in which case you don't need it.

Hope this helps

In my opinion divergent bars are the hardest technique in the Profitunity arsenal. Their probability of success is mostly dependent on angulation but they are only worth taking if the risk of the bar itself is quite contained. As for whether to reverse on a B/D/B it is entirely dependent on the situation and is quite difficult to pass a priori judgement on it. Generally speaking, it is worth reversing if we feel that we are at the end of an Elliott Wave of some kind and the AO corroborates that view.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
thank you for your reply, RbrTrader, if I may ask again, what was the most valuable for you from the home course ? Cause I'm very hesitant at the moment to buy it or not.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
yes, this is difficult one and only manageable with other indicators. BTW I don't use ELLIOTT on this - it's too back looking tool and you can always argue about recount, degree etc.

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
The most valuable thing I got out of the course was getting at the bottom of every indicator, signal and rule presented in the book. Only by slowly covering the alligator, the AO, fractals, entry and exit rules I got to figure out the ultimate reason for doing as suggested by Bill and Justine in their books. As as I said, if you feel that you grasped these concepts then the course will be just an annoyance as there isn't anything new or different that the books haven't covered. I'm quite a slow learner so for me the course was worth all the money I paid for.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Remember what Bills says about the structure of the market. He said that the structure of the market is the Elliott Wave and the structure of the Elliott Wave is the fractal of the Elliott Wave so even if I'm with you that we are not too obsessed with the actual count of each wave and subdivision the AO is a great tool to figure out where we are in relation to the broader wave

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Thanks a lot for your replies, appreciate it

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Yes, very informative replies.

But regarding the original question re reversing a position after a divergent bar has occured -- I strongly disagree.

Think about it: if you don't have position and you have valid divergent bar setup, you take it, right ? So if you have position already, that logically implies you at least square position. In this case, cause dbar is wm1 which almost surely should be followed by wm2 and wm3 by Bill Williams theory, the most logical step is sq and reverse IMHO.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Hi everybody, this is my first message in Forex Factory. I´m very interested in Profitunity System. I´m studying it and i think it´s fantastic , in particular the aims tools.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
Is there anything more in the course about the divergent bar? Because the angulation explained in the book is very subjective and very often there will be a second divergent bar in FOREX. Do they say something about the spread of the bar? Do we trade big divergent bars?

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
in an interview bill said to take the divergent bar at the end of a trend

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Assumptions: Bearish Diverent Bar, Trade sizes microlots

If you have no prior position -, place stop sell 1 microlot at wm1, another 5 at wm2, 4 microlots at wm3......

If your are already in a postition when the wm1 occurs, your tradesize will most probably be 6 or more microlots, because during the runup you would have added the reverse pyramiding way. If you would reverse your position now, you would go from LONG 6 to SHORT 6 microlots, i.e. sell 12 microlots.

But according to BW you close a position when your stoploss is broken OR when an opposite signal occurs: Close the psoition - Sell 6 microlots to go flat.

Now you have a Bearish Divergent Bar, so place an additional stop-buy for 1 microlot.

So before the divergent bar your position was 6 microlots LONG, after it is a SHORT position of 1 microlot.

My understanding. Correct me, if I`m wrong.

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
As you wrote "But according to BW you close a position when your stoploss is broken OR when an opposite signal occurs: Close the position - Sell 6 microlots to go flat." - Divergent bar in my understanding is new, opposite signal. So you should sq and reverse IMHO.

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
I don't think your interpretation is what Bill and Justine said about stop and reverse at B/D/B. Their advise is to stop and reverse but treat the reversal as a new position. In other words if you're fully invested on the long side and get a bearish divergent bar with angulation you should close your position (in your example your 6 units of risk) but reverse only 1 unit to end up short only 1 unit of risk. Then upon emergence of the other signals you can fully build your short position. But you should never go from fully invested on one side to fully invested on the other side, especially on B/D/Bs as they are the most speculative part of the trading strategy.

As for angulation, the book and the course are quite clear in saying that it is subjective and visual as opposed to mathematical so there isn't a lot of extra information apart from developing the ability to spot when prices pull away from the alligator and give better angulation. This is a concept that I find elusive and I haven't managed to master yet but it has been said to be one of the hardest part of the whole Profitunity system.

Hope this helps

I trade Bill Williams Chaos System as well but I added the Heinkin Ashi to my charts to see when the up and or down trends start and end they actually get me out before the original system does preventing slipage and added up more pips of the course of weeks and months every pip counts in this business expecially when you start getting up there in the amount of lots you open up. just a little added conformation that adds some pips by aliminating some of the slipage.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
heres the system with the henin ashi chart it actually gets you into the trend earlier and gets you out of the trend before it retraces back to green alligator line those pips add up over time and excpially when your dealing with big lot sizes that is alot of profit left on table

Hi there

just started studying this Stuff

I've read B.Williams first book,and now I'm studying the 2nd one

Please could you share your template(I love HeikenAshi )?

And What about your experience with this method?

thx

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
Hey guys, I've done some testing with Bill William's system on EUR/AUD on the daily TF, for the past 8-9 years(don't remember). I used all the rules right like he explains. I did the adding of position always 1% of my balance.

I did this some months ago. The return was 277% (!!) and the maximum drawdown was 25%, which makes it the best system I've ever seen. Remember, this was only in 1 pair, if the results were like this on 10 pairs the account would easily have grown 3000%+ !!

In the time I disregarded it because of the drawdown, 25% is kind of big. But this is without diversifying (which we can achieve trading more pairs/gold/silver), and I can just risk less on a trade to get lower drawdowns. I seriously don't know what I was thinking at the time, these are excellent results.

Anyway, I'm beginning to make an EA for MT4, and I wanted to know if any of you wanna help me. And I also have a question regarding the adding of positions. How are we supposed to add positions? Add always the same amount as the first position? Adding the same amount is scary, because some trades can easily make me lose 8% of my account (if I risk 1% per trade).

The excel sheet is here (can't upload xlsx files on FF for some reason): http://www.2shared.com/file/AtwTH5fy/EURAUD.html

In attachment is the balance.

Mmumble

Mr.W talks about adding 1 Contract for each signal

I guess we should adapt Profitunity to Forex Market.

One good filter could be fundamental analysis,i.e I'd watch carefully USDCHF,EURCHF,XAGUSD and XAUUSD on the next weeks and apply Profitunity rules to those instruments.

From my experience best adding signals usually come from AO,Fractals and ZONE bars. AC very often overlaps fractals and AO signals..

What I like most about ZONE bars is jumping trailing stop technique,usually I start moving my skirt protection after 3 ZONE bars of the same color(not 5 like Mr.W says)

just my 2 cents

The London Open Breakout

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
Here is a suggestion from post 56 (Not by me)   :

"First, my position sizing and risk management rules tell me exactly my  lot limit for a trade; and for me "a trade" begins when I get on board a  directional move and includes any subsequent add-on lots. A trade is  opened only on a signal from one of the Three Wise Men. Here is how I  normally allocate that lot limit:By my rule, I commit only 1 lot per buy/sell signal. Once a trade is opened, a signal is valid only if its fill will be beyond the Alligator in the direction of the trade. As long as my trade is profitable, I take all valid Profitunity  trade signals until my lot limit is reached or the trade is closed.  Valid Profitunity trade signals include those described in Bill  Williams' second book, New Trading Dimensions. Before adding on to a profitable position, pay strict attention to  how the add-on will impact trade risk limits and where breakeven is!"

To post an xlsx file you might try to zip or rar it first.

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
I used to have an EA built for Profitunity way back in the mt3 days.  One thing people need to keep in mind is that what makes Profitunity potentially profitable is the adding on signals and pyramiding a position. As you've learned first hand, it's not hard to get fantastic returns.  Just be sure to make sure that you're taking in to account the risk of having a lot of open positions if price goes against you in a big way.  Hence why I make sure to stop adding on once I've reached 3-5% risk out there.  I'd rather leave some potential money on the table than take huge losses because I've added on too much.   Same applies for diversifying across multiple markets.

--- 帖子 #1231 ---
Thanks for the suggestions, I'll apply that

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
This is a very chaotic system, I don't trust in it. One year ago, I partecipate to a project that uses a powerful mathematical system written in Matlab by a Greece Professor.

It's system had to solve tens of differential equations in matlab, passing then the result to an expert advisor written in mql. It can predict the direction of the market with a probability of 80%. After 2 months of proofs we abbandoned the project because the system failed. Caotic and random systems, in my experience are very unstable and the trading is unpredictable.

The math around them is partial and too far from the statistical science.

But it is only my opinion.

MJ

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
What was the mathematics the system used? It can be very complicated maths, but it may not apply to chaotic systems. Since it had to resolve differential equations, I got a feeling that the assumptions of that trading system are flawed.

I believe it's possible to trade using mathematics. Chaos theory applications are vast, and it applies to systems as complex as financial markets. I've also seen other mathematics applications to financial markets, in the domain of signal processing and time-series analysis. There's a thread about it on FF.

Don't take those conclusions so fast, because that system obviously didn't apply mathematics as it should.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
According to my knowledge and insights "CHAOS" as defined by BW is just his definition of chaos, but not identical to any other understanding of chaos in mainstream (or even Popular) science. Its just clever hype of an ordinary (but good) trendfollowing system. Just a couple of ma, macd and smoothings. No complicated math! Plainly pure, simple and elegant. But MM included!

The systems is though to use REVERSE pyramiding: In Chaos2 for example you start the most risky signal with the smallest stake ( DB = 1 microlot), your next signal would be superAO ( SAO=5 microlots), followed by XAO or fractals... BUT the the first signal AFTER SAO would be 4 microlots, the next one 3 microlots, followed by 2, 1 and sticking to 1. After each retracement (thats all a fractal is) you now add 1 microlot til you`ve run out of investable cash. You would not add after too many candles without retracemts (In the Zone).

Thats my understanding of position building according to BW.

Decreasing, adjusting and closing this position is a different story.

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
Hype is the right word. The system may be good and may work, but calling it an application of Chaos theory is a real stretch. Although BW talks about the fractal nature of the market, he does not use the mathematics of chaos. He calls a particular price pattern a "fractal", but that is just a name, and a distortion of what fractal stands for. It is a real mistake to think that you are actually using the fractal nature of the market.

In the first few chapters of his book, BW says that you cannot predict the market, that all indicators tell about the past not the future, that statistics of the past tell nothing of the future, and that past patterns have no predictive value. Then he proceeds to develop an argument for a system that violates every one of these principals. Hype, pure and simple.

That said, the Profitunity (another clever marketing tool) system seems to be profitable for many users, and I will probably spend many fruitless hours developing an EA to test that hypothesis.

edit: No I don't have to develop an EA. ForexFlash has posted several places to look
http://codebase.mql4.com/4488
http://codebase.mql4.com/3245
http://codebase.mql4.com/3239

In addition, the EA in the first above has been tested. Look here
http://www.tradingsystemforex.com/ex...ms-trader.html

Looks promising, but it has been optimized for the testing period. What will it do today?

--- 帖子 #1236 ---
Why not look at an offspring of Profitunity (replacing Alligator with plain -nonshifted- MAs) including a signal and email EA - unfortunately not a trading ea: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=37439

Those EAs aren't complete. The first one just buys on fractals, that's just 1/5 of what the system is.

And about the system, mathematicians and physicists had to use a supercomputer to do "6 million iterations". If they weren't applying chaos theory, I don't know what those calculations were that they had to use a supercomputer to do them.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
I guess everyone of those mathematicians and physicists in those old days (almost a quarter of a century ago) would have loved to exchange one or even two of his supercomputers for one of nowadays lowest priced PCs.

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
There are three books published by Williams on this trading method to this date. Each of them explain different signals along with describing the alligator indicator. In my opinion the two first books are those worth looking at. The third is ok, but I found the "new" method described in his last book to be unprofitable actually... Just my two cents though!

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
You seem to be quite correct about the EA's..too bad, but maybe they can be modified. And Funyoo's tests show that using those simple EA's one can achieve very nice results if you optimize over the test period. But that's true of many EA's. What happens in an out of sample period is what is important.

As to 6 million iterations, that depends a lot on what was being calculated. Simply optimizing one of the EA's probably took many times 6 million iterations of some part of the code. And that does not apply any chaos theory.

My PC, and most probably yours, can do 6 million simple iterations in a millisecond or so. Minicomputers and plain old mainframes that I used to work on in 1990  could also do millions of simple iterations in a millisecond, and supercomputers were even faster. Unless you know what he was iterating, 6 million iterations is not very impressive. Do not be fooled by hype.

BTW, can you describe the computations the mathematicians and physicists were making? If they are described in one of his books, please point me at book and page. I am sincerely interested, and I may have to apologize if he really used chaos theory.

I do not argue that the system works or not, I argue that you must evaluate it while ignoring what the salesman (author) says about it. The scientific method works even in FX trading.

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
For what is worth my approach to this method has been very similar to yours as I was trying to understand the science behind it and then apply it or perhaps even improve it. I bought all three books and read them time and time again until I came across a lot of helpful points in there which are often overlooked by the scientifically minded community. I do agree and think like you that back in the days you needed super computers to do what Excel does now in a fraction of a second and I'm with you when you say that BW hasn't given us a proof of why fractals follow the formation that he suggests in his work but, and this is a very big one, he keeps saying that the method works as long as the trader is in line with the market and uses his perspective.

At the beginning I thought this was nothing more than patronising and only after trying and failing to automate the system  I realised the meaning of his message. Bottom line, I believe this is a VERY powerful method for a trader who would lilke to ride a trend for as long as possible and has the PERSPECTIVE to understand how fractals, the Elliott Wave and Profitunity signals work. Remember that Bill says that the structure of the market is the Elliott Wave and the structure of the Elliott Wave is the fractal. It all starts here and everything else follows.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
At first glance this looks like a really good way to overcomplicate your trading but at it's heart it is basically trading breakouts of s/r. This is usually profitable providing you can learn to let a trade run. I'm a big fan of Heiken Ashi, if anyone is trying this method maybe add HA candles (in custom indicators as standard with mt4) and see if it helps?

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
I'm not fooled by hype, but I don't think he'd say mathematicians and physicists did 6 million iterations to arrive at the 3 lines (which are very peculiar, because they project into the future and use 3 different timeframes) if there wasn't a scientific method behind it. And no, unfortunately he doesn't explain the computations they did. He just says they did the computations to calculate the 3 lines periods and future offsets.

This trading system is a very loose application of Chaos theory, but that's what other people with maths background do too with other systems. For example, there are people apply digital signal processing to the markets, and they always make some assumptions or apply some methods which aren't so rigorous, but it still works.

The main point in this system is that the fractals, AO, AC, trading zones and bases are the signals, and the alligator filters the noise.

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
Hello, I want to help create the EA.

Here thw enters how I understand:

1- fractal

2 - AO signals (allways after fractal entry)

3 - Balance line

or

1 - Bulish or Bearish divergent bar

2 - AO 3 bar of the same color

3 - fractal

For the SL I use:

The 1st SL is the uther side of the bar in wich I entered

After 3 consecutive bars in the same zone I change SL to the high/low of the preview bar

if I see divergence bar or the blu bar of the MFI I put my SL on the high/low of these bar.

P.S. Sorry for my english.

--- 帖子 #1247 ---
I have taken the Profiunity home study course (yes paid the nearly $5000 at the time) and used to trade Bills methods. Fractal breakouts have been replaced by "bdb's, bullish and bearish divergence bars. Justine (who is the better trader of the 2) takes them when they have a very large gap/distance from the gator. Also to note is taking trades after there is divergence between the price and the AO. Bill like to see 3-4 peaks on the AO before he take a trade as that will usually representing the end of a wave three before the AO crosses back over the zero line creating the 4th wave.

The main issue with Bills signals and applying them to an EA is the fact that they all repaint. The AO is the worst for this. Bill does not even use the AC in his trading anymore and I believe this was a main factor.

I left this style of trading and focused on Volume spread analysis and Wykoffs methods since Bill's best entries are the bullish/bearish divergence bars which are in fact springs and upthrusts (in VSA terms).

What makes Bill a great trader is his money mng abilities and his ability to control his mind while trading. If you call Profitunities office and speak with Justine about Forex she will do her best in a subtle way to direct you to the futures and stock markets.

I am all for trying to make an EA for this method but do not see how it will ever be achievable with repainting indicators that are really not suited for this market. Let me know if I can help.

There is another trader on this site who live very close to Bill and has traded with him personally. I will PM him and see if he doesnt mind stopping in on the thread to post some of the new ways Bill takes his trades.

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
Hi sonofsin5, that would be great if your friend post something in this thread.

So they're not using the old method anymore and don't trade forex market?

and i was just wondering what kind of money management does he use?

thx

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
They don't trade the method out of book 1, the method from book 2 has been completely revised with some methods taught in the private tutorial and home study course.

Bill uses pyramiding when he trades, that is also talked about in detail in their home study course as well as on page 155 of trading chaos 2nd edition.

I have not spoken with anyone from profitunity in years so I cant say what they trade anymore.

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
i see, thx for the answer..

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
The methods in New Trading Dimensions is no longer used.  Refer to Trading Chaos: Second Edition.

The AO signal (I think) you are referring to is where three complete consecutive bars signal an entry.

For instance, if you have green red red red bars then you would enter a pending sellstop order on pip below the low of the completed bar where you confirmed the third red bar in the AO.  Your stop loss is the high of that same bar.

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Before I mention anything about money management, I refer you to review the reverse pyramiding concept.  In a pristine set of trades you would have a divergent candle, the AO signal, and three fractal entries consisting of 1, 5, 4, 3, and 2 contracts respectively for a total of fifteen maximum contracts.

Contracts is another name for lots.

Considering a stop loss is an executive decision on your part where you have to decide your aggression level.  Referencing the EURUSD H1 chart beginning 8/31, you have your choice of following trades with a lagging five completed bar stop loss, a green line stop loss, or a red line stop loss.  All of these are mentioned in the book Trading Chaos: Second Edition.

The Awesome Oscillator hit a peak 9/1 around GMT 11:00 indicating we were in the third Elliot Wave.  If you are a skittish trader and used the five-bar lagging stop, your trades would have been stopped out several times.  A red balance line stop loss would have kept you in the trend until 9/2.  Also there was a second set of entries until wave three gave way to wave four on 9/6.

To answer your question on money management, once you have reached a level of trading where you can spot entries and take advantage of the reverse pyramiding concept you should not leverage more than 50% of your available margin.  Additionally, your total margin risked is up to you if you choose a lesser amount.  Ultimately if you are trading the method the market manages your trades and MM.

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
I nearly finished my EA like a week ago, but it still needs some changes. But I don't think this will be a winning system, it's a trading strategy with very low risk-to-reward. It needs markets that trend a lot and that don't usually reverse trend, which is the total opposite of intraday forex markets. I'm not even gonna finish it, got better things to use my time in.

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
Money is always made in a trend not in correction waves such as 2 and 4.

The problem with the attempt at creating a black box system is that you must make decisions based on some subjective information in the market and cannot fully automate all signals delivered using the Three Wiseman method.

I would agree if you were creating an EA to automate some functions such as the Green Line Stop Close Only or seeking out initiating trades like a divergent bar or fractal breakout.  Even still there is consideration to the type of divergent bar 1-1, 1-2, 3-3, or 3-2 in addition to squat bars relative to the position of the divergent bar.

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
what does it mean by not leveraging more than 50 % of our available margin? for one trade?

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
You would never place that amount on any one trade.

In the number of trades opened via initiating signals such as Divergent Bars and Breakout Fractals then adding on to your positions with Wiseman Fractals, Breakout Fractals, and Super AO, you would never open trades where your available margin is exceeded by 50%.

However, and this is a big however, you are to trade your own belief system where I might me comfortable with this 50% level and someone else is more comfortable with a 20% level.

Let me now talk about what you mentioned about leveraging that full amount on a single trade.  Again, you would never leverage a huge amount on a single initiating trade.  Instead, on a divergent bar with angulation or a breakout fractal, one lot or derivative of a single lot for your account size is enough to start the trading campaign off.  If you are not yet consistently profitable only add an additional lot for each add on signal until you are experienced enough to reverse pyramid.

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
let say if i trade 10 k in a standard account, meaning my max open position is 5 lot (5000), is that right?

--- 帖子 #1258 ---
1) If it is your personal belief system to trade up to half your margin yes.

2) 1 Lot != 1000.  Dependent on if the USD is the base pair depends on the margin required for your trade.

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
You have done an excellent job of simplifying what could be quite a complex trading system.

It has taken me a while to see how simple you have made it. and also how profitable.

Buying the indicators from you many months ago was perhaps the best money I have spent in several years.

Hi, I've just begun to learn Profitunity. Have already grabbed the basic but some areas are still vague. Please kindly someone help me with these:

Question 1:

1. Up fractal comes up

2. A buy signal is generated

3. But the buy stop doesn't get hit yet

4. Down fractal comes up

Now, does it mean that the up fractal (no. 1) must now be ignored?

Question 2:

I've learned that it is best to stay away from the market when the alligator lines are intertwining. Now, what about downtrend? Is it possible to still make profits in downtrend market using Profitunity technique?

Question 3:

What is the best method to exit?

Thanks everyone!

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
Have you read the books by Mr Williams yet...?

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
Q1. as long as it formed above the red line, it's still a valid fractal

Q2. yes, as long there's a trend, you can make profit using this technique

Q3. if you want to stay longer in a trend, use the green/red line stop loss. but if you don't like to give away your profit too much, use previous 5 bar highest/lowest. there's no best method to exit, it's all come down with our own executive decision..

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
Hello BW folks,

Certainly I perceived this system can amass thousands of pips for a short period of time IF APPLIED PROPERLY.

May I ask you guys if you actually trade on the impulsive (Elliott) waves and try to refrain from the corrective waves even though there seems to be favorable setup by BW indicators alone? If this is the case, do you employ the five magic bullets explained in TC 1st edition to corroborate your wave counting?

Any comment/suggestion is highly appreciated as this must be the last piece of the puzzle on making a fortune by the system.

Guys,

I wrote to Profitunity asking about the different kind of signals mentioned in their book "New Trading Dimensions" and "Chaos Trading 2nd Edition" and Justine (Bill's daughter) wrote me back that due to current market's different condition, they no longer use the old signals (saucer, twin peaks, AO zero cross, and trading zone). They only use signals as written in the latest book (Fractals, Wisemen 1-3, DBD/BDB and Super AO).

Now, in your experience, do you still use those old signals in your current trading? How are they doing? If so, in what time frame?

Thanks

What's DBD/BDB?

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
My bad. I mean BuDB/BeDB, Bullish/Bearish Divergence Bar

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
It's all clear know. I tought it was something else/new.

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
I didn't realize it was a lowbrow research...... BUT. the research does lead to fantastic profits....

Maybe one day you would be good enough to point us to some acceptable research of your own that generates equivalent profits and we will all benefit.

Hi fellow traders,

I'd like you guys to evaluate my idea, Chikou-span遅行スパン (Lagging span in English) breakout.

For example, an emerging Up Fractal above Alligator lips in green from the bracketed market usually indicates the inception of bull market. This notion is always true in hindsight. The Chikou span gives you a clue on effectively identifying the false breakout.

Check your chart by plotting Ichimoku.mq4 after turing all of Colors except #4 Lime (for Chikou span) into None, then locate the candles where the expression of inequality below holds true:

Bullish: Chikou span (note: the latest value is shown 26 periods ago) > High price of the candle of 26 periods ago,

Bearish: Low price of candle of 26 periods ago > Chikou span.

If this is the case, your Up/Down Fractals formed above/below Alligator are highly likely to be a promising bullish/bearish Wiseman 3 signal, thus you are able to enter/add your position least stressfully.

Then, when should we close the existing positions? That's the moment the above inequalities become inadequate (when getting to the equilibrium point (Kinkou均衡)), which might be well before three Alligator lines are intertwining. However your exit must be less painful than the New-Trading-Dimensions way of exit formula where you give back what you will have amassed to the market.

Finally, please note that the Chikou-span breakout is a popular strategy for Japanese, which has proved over half a century. My idea is merely an application to the Bill Williams system.

Good luck!

As this thread seems stagnating, let me raise one more topic.

Can markets allow us to properly calculate the standard deviation? Unless you can substantiate it, the credibility of your technical analysis must be deteriorated down to almost nothing. Why? Because you unconsciously presume the 19th century's Gaussian distribution.

This assumption alone provides us with an enormous edge in the market.

Because now we are able to pick up trading systems or methods that reasonably work among the waste collected over centuries.

Do you make sense what I'm arguing? If not, you are most likely to lose money in the market. Read this book, The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence by Benoit Mandelbrot.

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
I'm not sure what you are saying. If you refer to the fact that markets are not stationary, I could not agree more. However, when the series is stationary, the standard deviation calculation is not dependent on the distribution. It is calculated the same way for a Gaussian distribution as for any non-gaussian.

On the other hand, the standard deviation is meaningless if stationarity does not hold. By definition stationarity does not hold if the moments depend on the time when they are calculated, or the duration of the sample used.

The FX market may be in some sense short term stationary, i.e., the moments may change very slowly w.r.t the TF in use. In that case, it makes sense to compute the S.D. and any other moments that are useful. However, the computation must use a sliding window that is short w.r.t. the time it takes the S.D. to change much. This means that the start time for computation must slide.

Also I don't see how the Gaussian assumption provides us with an edge. It is not true, and it is meaningless in the long term due to stationarity considerations. The only edge I could see is if I were trading against someone that assumed stationarity. But I don't think many traders think that deeply, or make trades on that assumption.

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
If you can work out all that theory, surely you can work out how to post a chart to explain it further, an example of a winning trade at least?

You don't even need any extra software, MT4 can do, I'm just saying...

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
Thank you for the nice introductory explanations of standard deviation concept (S.D.).

Yes, S.D. can be appropriately computed in hindsight, however almost in vain if we apply it to the future as we see past returns are most likely not indicative of future results. The backtesting provides a good example.  The EA usually becomes obsolete in a couple of months even though it demonstrates an impressive equity curve for the last ten years. Can we always attribute it to the over-fitting issue? I think almost all of technical analysis are on common ground of this matter. We can properly calculate the S.D. for a given period in the past, but the problem is we are trying to apply the probability distributions we get in backtesting to the market in the future regardless of consciously or unconsciously. This is the reason why a seemingly promising (statistically significant at present) trading strategy is most likely short-lived and destined to throw away to the wasteland.

Having said that, it might be possible to compute the S.D. in the foreseeable future if we alleviate the assumptions to the extent not practical enough to withstand as you mentioned "if stationarity does hold," which is totally irrelevant to what we pursue.

Chaos theory offers us a clue to evade the persistent issue and how to pick up a reasonably right method to approximate the current market. How? I'll leave the answer to the aforementioned book, however please don't misunderstand I'm not endorsing the Bill's trading system but just remind the thread participants of the foundation of Chaos trading. In this regard I'd also like to have comments by traders who subscribe different methodology, if possible.

Have a great weekend!

I remember when Mandlebrot's fractal article on the stock market was published.

One of the readers who wrote in to Scientific American to comment on the article, pointed out that Ralph Nelson Elliott had some nerve stealing Mandlebrot's ideas some thirty years before Mandlebrot had thought of them.

I like Bill Williams ideas because they attempt to use Elliott Wave without the need to really understand Elliott Wave.

Unfortunately there are so many people who falsely claim Elliott Wave expertise (including a few on this thread) that they give the subject a bad name. Nonetheless, if you study the wave principle and use Bill's fractals and alligator you can do very well.

No curve fitting required, no magic, no standard deviations, no secret sauce indicators; just learn to count waves and read the Alligator.  Take the first fractal above or below the red line and keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
Refreshing.... good solid Canuck logic.

There is no doubt in my mind that markets are wave within wave within wave ...... like in nature. William's attempt to delineate this structure and exploit it is a noble one and can no doubt be profitable (as can most other methodologies) if traded by one who has a good grasp of classic principles of technical analysis. One principle (and skill) in particular is that of understanding the importance of and the ability to recognize significant areas of support and resistance. I am actually quite surprised that William's never made this an important and more simple element of his methodology as opposed to the convoluted and arcaine Wisemen concepts. If markets truely are wave like in nature then it stands to reason that certain S/R levels are going to be the wave turning points i.e. fractals of greater importance or call them super fractals, if you will.

In my humble opinion, no matter what your trading methodology, one can hardly go wrong knowing your S/R theory, after that it becomes a matter of wait and see (the letting the market come to you approach) how price reacts at those levels then trading accordingly as indicated by the Alligator et al (or for that matter, any other system).

My 2 pips worth. Thanks for listening.

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
O.K. as I don't trade the William's approach per se it took me a minute to put together a couple of simple charts to illustrate what I said in the above post. I usually draw the lines by hand (just takes a little practice), however being lazy in this instance, I used a generic indie. Don't ask me if its any good or not because I don't know, it's only for illustrative purposess. As you might notice, even if the market is quite choppy (corrective wave) your still on the right side of direction as price pushes away from an S/R level and in trading, that's almost the whole battle won or at least a good part of it.

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
wow...I dont know how you guys do this,so many indicators makes me nauseous. Im a firm believer if you still waiting on indicators to tell you when to get in and out, your not ready to trade yet.

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Ahhh ...... a perfect example of how we all trade our own belief systems  and that's what makes a market what it is.

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
Hello Wab,

I'm afraid that you are slightly missing my point that the common ground of the most of technical analysis out there is the 19th century's world view that Gaussian or normal distribution curve represents, which is the culprit why we always lose money in the market. According to Bill Williams we need to replace the current paradigm ("brief system") presumed naively with the totally different approach known as Chaos theory. I referred the thread participants to read the Mandelbrot book as I don't think they have much interest in delving into this subject but just keen on superficially acquiring Bill's trading strategy.

However I agree to your conclusion without reservation. Thanks for your comments.

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
everything dont work for everyone...why dont you find what work best for you..

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
donfriday,

Here is the chart I overlaid Chikou span on the Trading-Chaos-2nd-edition template in EURUSD, Daily.

Please notice the simple line in gold color (Close price plotted 26 time periods behind counted from the most current candle, i.e., Close[25]) disqualifies many reckless Wiseman 3 (Fractal Breakout) signals in the choppy market.

Second, Ichimoku Kinko Hyo doesn't have an exit strategy as you might be aware of. Thus I'll scrap my idea to apply Chikou span to it. It should be employed as the confirmation tool of (initial and add-on) Wiseman 3 entry only.

Finally, you may find it lagging a bit behind, however which is the cost to save our hard-earned money.

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
sorry none of bill williams book talk about ichimoku which i have no clue about how it work....millions of strategy work in this market it all depend on how you interpret it with your mm....

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
Hi, I need some idea how to put the first stop loss when you opened a new position. Should we use red line or use the opposite fractal for that one.

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
i guess either way is fine, it all depends on our own risk profile..

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
there are 3 signal for entries on this system ...if you are trading on the fractal then your entry should base on start and signal...sell or buy signal and sl at start sometime the risk is too high to take so i wait for pull back for lower risk of entries..

Bill talk about start and signal on how to use the fractal, i suggest you read it over again for better understanding..

Good luck..

Alligator is sleeping now after huge meal of pips yesterday! My ADR says 382, is that a record?

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
Hi guys,i am happy to be here and see there is an active thread about Bill Williams.I basically used ichimoku charting system so far  but i always had fractals on board also to see the swings.

So last week i got very interested in williams aproach and read almost anything about it,but i still have 2 very basic questions about it.

1)if the alligator sleeps, it wakes up after a fractal is hitted and the ''train'' starts .so by the time your order is hitted you dont know if it will really wake up.the whipsaw might continue

how alligator helps us if we set a pending order in a sleeping alligator then?

2)if the fractal is formed under the balance line(red) but hitted above is it a valid BUY fractal?Bill says it is,but different souces say that the fractal must be formed above  and hitted above to be a valid one.which one is the correct one??

thanks for your feedback

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
the answer is simple/// if all alligator is sleeping after a  hungry day you have to wait for it to awake but before that your fractal entry will be start and signal...make sure that entry fractal you are taking have start and signal with 5 consecutive bars preceding lows and preceding  lower  5 that the middle bar form fractal and sl will be at start but dont forget it depend on your risk...THE ONLY THING ALLIGATOR DOES IS CHANGE OF MOMENTUM, VOLUME AND PRICE AND TELL IF BUY ABOVE OR SELL BELOW...good luck

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Wow, big day yesterday, best day ever, but not to confuse bull market with brains! Couldn't post chart and this may be only one today.

Here is what I am watching today, will the trend continue or more "news" to reverse everything again. Currencies are all like the train in the shunt yard, back & forth, just get out of the station and go in one direction I say!

Japan is open, long time till Europe open, maybe direction will show early, or alligator will sleep longer? waiting for break of fractal, all the best.

Hello guysNew to chaos theory and very enthousiastic about it.

I am posting a EUR/USD analysis on H1 Chart,i would be glad to hear your opinion on it as i am new and would like to be sure i have understand things properly.

I have some comments on chart,and the conclusion is that i ll wait first for alligator to take a nap.It starts talking a nap now but the price is going up so this might be a sign of a bad whipsaw which i hate so much lol...

oh you mean on the specific chart of eur/usd  i posted or generally the template?

i would take the signals as mentioned on the williams book,wait for the first fractal break out and then take the rest signals,really there is nothing on the chart more than some extra s/r lines just to see what other people see,and a different fractal indie...but dont want  to get you dizzy i ll post clean charts next time

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
I am not too sure about the 'divergence' that you have marked on your chart, perhaps you have to revisit that.

These two indicators may be helpful to someone

The Williams system is a lot simpler and the signals are relatively easy to see if you just use awesome and alligator with fractals. The really experienced people use awesome and fractals mixed in with some EW. Surely you are confused with the number of indicators you are showing.

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
yeah that was my mistake-there is NO divergence there,awesome and price were both going down.saw that few days later.

i ll definatelly chek the indies thanks

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
Try to strip those indicators from the chart, they will overload you with data that will confuse your thinking.

I spent many, many hours hunting for an Alligator Cross alert.

I finally found an indicator that almost does the job.  Unfortunately the sound doesn't work

However, I think all Chaos fans will find this most useful and maybe some kind soul will get the sound working for us.

You can set this indicator up and it should give you a sound alert and an arrow when the Red Alligator line crosses the Blue one.

The arrows work.

Settings are:  true, false, 2, 8, 5, 4, 2 13, 8, 4

Or you can set it to alert when the Green line crosses the Blue.

Settings for that are:  true, false, 2, 5, 3, 4, 2 13, 8, 4

Land of cash is working on an entry system based on a MA shift crossover for their LOC Trader ea.  (Do a search on FF for LOCTrader.) With that, you can then choose your choice of trailing stop strategy.

In many ways it will allow Chaos traders to get an automatic entry on an Alligator Cross over and then trail a stop along one of the Alligator lines.

Sleep may be possible again if we can get the sound part of this alert working.

--- 帖子 #1313 ---
thanks Blaiserboy,thats a great site

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
I saw that site mentioned somewhere..... maybe in the early posts of this thread...... or another similar thread.....  The thing has taught me a lot.

Reading a book is great but actually making the entries and studying the results has been great for me.  Besides...... what else is there to do on a Saturday night.?  LOL

I am attaching a trailing stop ea that may be helpful, one will have to open it up  in Metaeditor to get the idea as to the settings required, I have not used it yet.  I got it from "http://www.fxoo.org" and there are instructions on that site.

--- 帖子 #1320 ---
Speaking for myself as it relates to the daily timeframe, chaos has been chaotic to say the least. 2011 did not favor trend following systems, and trend followers in general have had an inconsistant time in the last few years. I have modified my approach both with indicators and timeframe and will return to the daily timeframe and profitunity when things clear up. It remains to be seen whether this is a long term structural change(doubtful) or not, although volatilty is up 400% in the last 10 years compared with the previous 100! Speaking with other profitunity students who talk to the home office, it has been tough for most who follow Bill's system. Most are trading intraday. I know our friend youfazi is doing great in the 1 and 5 min timeframe and I am sure he will chime in at some point.

--- 帖子 #1326 ---
Here is how that particular set of trades worked out:  Some of them were taken a bit late.

I would also have done a bit better trailing a stop on the red Alligator line.

I find that you can add on when the price breaks a fractal for a break out trade as BW teaches.

But I also use previous historical fractals, from the previous wave, in what I call break in trades.

It works well and is worth testing.

Hi guys...i just wonder if anyone still had trouble with the wisemen signals especially the first wiseman...

I found out that using first wiseman is very confusing and very risky, i believe this is why Dr. Williams said to use the smallest of the asset allocation available or simply use no leverage to trade this signal, but until i read the first book (the first book is actually the third that i've read) then all started to fit the picture...

Elliot wave counting and the squat bar fit with the wisemen and solve each other's puzzle.

Just sharing ideas

--- 帖子 #1329 ---
Has anyone tried using LOCTrailingMA for Bill Williams trades?

Here is an an example using the Green Alligator line as a stop. You can also use fractals or any of a variety of other methods.

This particular trade worked out so well, that I just had to share it.

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
Wab, first of all:  I  like your signature.

Second: I don´t know the LOCTrailingMA, is it a commercial product ?

Third: Did you enter  LONG when the Alligator was SHORT  ?

I thought that the Alligator has to open first into the direction you want to trade, but maybe I am wrong ?

I haven´t read the 1328 posts, only the first few where the BillWilliams method is described and yours.

--- 帖子 #1331 ---
Here is the web page for the EA he is describing. cost is $20

http://www.landofcash.net/ForexExper...railingMA.aspx

Looks a bit interesting...... I would like to hear more of his experience with it.

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
Entry level was above the HH  (higher high)  fractal that is above the red line (Third wise man I believe.)  It wasn't above the red line when it formed but the red line dipped and made it legitimate to take that level for an entry 7 bars later.

Then I let LOC trail the stop on a 5, 3 displaced smoothed median MA (The Green Alligator line) plus one pip.  The one pip extra prevents being stopped out on touches of the Alligator line.  I also set my intial stop one pip below the fractal as Bill Williams does and LOC will move it up once the trade gets going and the Green Alligator line gets above your entry level.

Once you get in a trade you let LOC manage it and it really makes trading a lot less time consuming.  Even one minute charts can take an hour or more to run out a good trade and that is an hour that you can walk away and not have to baby sit.

The Version that does this is LOCTrailingMA.  Another version, LOCTrailing, has fractal stops that also work well.  Sometimes I use an X bars back stop which it also has.

Mikhail, the fellow who codes LOC, is very decent and and added the displaced moving averages and at my request.

I am not in anyway involved with LOC beyond using it and thinking that it is great trailing stop software.  It is a great system to use in conjunction with Bill Williams methods and does a lot to solve the problem of where to exit and how to manage a trade once you are in it.

Check out Land of Cash (LOC) for some demo videos.  It is worth every cent in my opinion.

Thanks for sharing the tip on LOC Trailing EA, will probably purchase....

Now, how are you showing the HH, HL, LL & LH points on your chart?

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
HH HL LH LL  represent in most cases the fractals.

Try this attached indicator

--- 帖子 #1336 ---
That indicator may fill your hard drive with extremely large MT4 log files and cause you problems.  Keep a close eye on your hard drive space if you use it.

The fractals in MT4 do the same job perfectly in identifying  the correct entry with the red alligator line.

--- 帖子 #1337 ---
Wow, I have not used that indicator, i just use an indicator that I bought from one of the thread members to show the fractals and that has been good enough.

Good thing you mentioned that.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1338 ---
I will post more charts using LOC as I trade them.

I occasionally use the X bars back stop or fractals for a stop but generally the Alligators lips, plus one pip seems to be best.

--- 帖子 #1340 ---
The H1 USDJPY made a nice trade.  Once I entered I had nothing to to do but check it later.  I should have taken a profit at 161.8 but I let it run to see what it would do.

I am going to trade it again in H1, as it just broke a trend line after a 61.8 retrace and will likely break above the fractal next.

Once again, I have LOC set to add a stop at 16 pips and then it will trail the stop as  the green Alligator line rises above the price.

If the price breaks and closes above the next trend line (not shown) I will add another trade on.  This time I will take profits on 50% at 161.8 (which is at 81.993) and let LOC handle the rest of it.

The beauty of this is that I can now go about the rest of my day and just check this once in a while to see what it is doing.  It will either work or it won't.

For interested persons really to understand this system it is necessary to understand that this is in the first place connected with worldoutlook. Nobody is not conceived on word Williams about that that to understand his(its) system it is necessary to have "OTHER THINKING", then possible understand about than his(its) books and after see, exactly "SEE" market on graph.

Can say its opinion about system that this real "GRAALI". For me B.VILIYAMS the most greatest трейдер and under that else alive so am going to to him to go and поблагодорить for his(its) works and studies and certainly for books in which he has described the laws and principles of the motion market. Who will be able to understand with his(its) book all rest выкинет in pail with laughter understanding what ерундой was a downtrodden head. Nowhere in network nothing costing on this system you will not find since only units докапываются before essence and these units наврятли will want this are divided. So the most stubborn and thinking is reached success. Remember "OTHER THINKING"!

The Parameter whole one:

BarsToProcess=1000; //maximum amount bar for calculation of the indicator (-1 - all bars)

When aiming on bar is displayed surfacing help with explanation in accordance with book B.Williams

Index of the Relief Market (Market Facilitation Index, BW MFI)

The Indicator pays on formula:

BW MFI = (HIGH - LOW) / VOLUME

Where:

HIGH - a maximum price of the current bar;

LOW - a minimum price of the current bar;

VOLUME - a volume of the current bar.

The Signals Market Facilitation Index (BW MFI):

The Simultaneous growing BW MFI and volume (Volume) speaks of that that all more player falls into the market (grows the volume), and new players open the positions toward development of the bar.

The Simultaneous fall BW MFI and volume speaks of reduction of the interest participant to given speaker of the price.

BW MFI вырос, but volume fell   market does not support such speaker of the price. Change the price   result gamble.

BW MFI fell, but volume вырос   goes the hardened fight between oxen and bear (the volume вырос), but power approximately are (the indicator fell). Such bar B.VILIYAMS named "cowerring". Usually breakout of such bar very important with standpoint future speakers price.

include.

B. Williams honour-his indicator.

BW MFI fell, and the volume has grown a fierce struggle between the bulls and bears (volume grew up), but the forces are nearly equal (the indicator fell). Such bar b. Williams called "prisedaûŝim". Typically, this bar is a very important breakthrough in terms of future price movements.

"Blue bar"-is very important in trade under the existing methodology, if, after "blue" appear consistently 3 "green" ("red"), then it's a reliable entry above (below) the third bar in long (short).

The rules should include above (below) the third bar after blue. location of three bars of the same color after Blue does not depend on the location of the crocodile, so you can be in trend and counter-trend. If you enter inside the blue ("intestines", i.e. on smaller timeframes), Moose should be put just above (below) the blue on the original ff.

Put my teacher because he led the "prisedaûŝij" in the grey and is either a turn, or pointing to the continuation of the trend ("thick bar"), climbing up inside it on smaller timeframes, and finding there too "blue".

Go to any of the rules of BV-five bars, lips, teeth, angulâciâ, etc. to put either below the nearest Elks fractal for sale or under rule 2 fractal back (left) from the entrance

I suppose everyone will have a different experience.  When I first read his book I didn't quite connect with the psychological and mental points  he was writing about.  It wasn't until later and when I looked at the system in its entirety that it made some sense.

I've had profitable results, even with very small accounts I was impressed with how he laid out money management aspect of the trades.   I think other systems fail in this regards.  Other systems will point out optimal entry and indicator signals.  Not many will show you how to manage the trade and especially when to exit. The exit is sometimes where other systems get killed.  They'll be profitable, stay in a trade too long, and not only give back all profits, but sometimes take big losses.   I have an old statement on my site where I traded a micro account and consistently had a profit factor between 3-17  with drawdowns less than 10%  The first half of the year I lost half the account, the 2nd half of the year I traded Chaos, made back all the loses and doubled the account.

I did use some Elliott Wave, but the point is the Chaos Method can be traded as is, or it can be coupled with another system to support analysis of the overall trend. It can be used to trade with the trend, countertrend, short time frame long time frames, all under one consistent framework.  There is time involved, and while I like other systems that keep it simple, sometimes being too simple leaves a system incomplete and vulnerable in changing markets.

It's not for everyone, it's just a matter of whether it'll suit and fit your style of trading. Anyways, what matters int he end is results, consistency, safety and profits.

--- 帖子 #1377 ---
This is a conservative trading approach......., we have to be patient to locate the correct entries. It takes practice, many people want to rush their entries.

There are actual trades posted earlier in the thread by someone who has mastered the approach using faster charts.

Hi people, reading the Bill William's book "Trading Chaos second edition" I don't find any reference to AC indicator but in http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=26044 it is mentioned and used.

Instead I found that in Bill William's book "New Trading Dimensions" it is used ( attached there is an interesting document explaining BW five dimensions). Also you can find it explained in this link:
http://www.mql5.com/en/articles/139

Could anyone help me to clarify what is the correct "Profitunity System", and what is the most recent and accurate system?

Thanks a lot in advance to everyone who help me!!!

Fed77, but book 2 talks about wisemen (1,2,3) and wiseman 1 is against trend. I am trying to understand if profitunity (i.e. Wisemen 1,2,3) is older than 5 dimension chaos system, which seems more accurate and profitable. Could you confirm this?

--- 帖子 #1393 ---
It is impossible consider only 1 book new measurements she good under trend and TCH 2, but the market is found in different conditions so it is necessary to use all books.Trade chaos 1 book too very good chapter  9

--- 帖子 #1394 ---
The system currently used by Profitunity in their training refers to the content of Trading Chaos 2nd edition. All trading signals come from the 3 Wiseman (BDB, Super AO and fractal) and no longer refer at AO/AC and older indicators. Of course, the newer material builds upon the work done by Bill Williams and there is continuity with what he presented in his older books but the new material is organised and structured around those three indicators, which in my opinion are simpler to understand and follow.

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
Did you read the Williams books? In the post 6005442 you can download the home study cours of profitunity. I never try the 2H TF. You can try it. But it's depending and from your broker server time. For example on TF 4H my broker (GMT+1) have good signal, but at the broker with GMT+0 there no signal. For this reason I prefer M15, H1 or D1.

P.S. My english is the same

Hi!Better to do analysis on the first day with the capture time interval of 100-140 bars, but you can also use custom time periods, the main thing that you are able to consider a third wave and select the actual time frame to trade, depending on your deposit in compliance with money management, a technique works on all time frames principle investments waves shorter time order in larger waves has not been canceled.

I certainly will ask the moderators as exceptions leave the website link as many requests come in a personal account. All the required information and free traders remain expensive on my site http://profitunityclub.com

My daily reviwe.

The day 21/12/12 is bearish bar without extra long shadows. This bar is struck the least Pin bar on 19/12/12.

We have:

On Daily chart

divergence on the MACD indicator

we are in the red zone (AO and AC are red)

formation of fractal on bar 19/12/12

price reached the target zone 61.8%  of Fibonacci expansion

price reached the middle of the rising channel and bounced

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On Weekly Chart

price almost reached the moving average EMA240 and almost pushed off her

we have a very nice pin bar

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

conclusion:

Based on the daily chart, it is possible that the fifth wave ended, hence the weekly chart has formed one of the impulse waves, it is probably the first, for sure it will be possible to say when (if) on the daily chart the candle closes below the Alligator's teeth.

We can put a pending order for the minimum (minus 1 point) weekly bar and wait for 3 consecutive columns appear in red on the display AD, which signals to refill short.

One must be careful when prices approach alligators, maybe she will push off of it.

Probably noticed all of the advantages on MT4 MT5 where it is impossible to maintain, and close a separate transaction open at different times, of course, everything is done for the purpose of earning a brokerage company, not a trader, poetoum thought to myself that this technique Bill Williams will work better on MT4 platform, as for the strict observance mm each additional item on the next addition will be made ​​after the return of the previously protected open orders, simply can not be applied in MT5 flexibility when you want to do it (send profits to the bank, and the previously open position to maintain and provide earnings grow.)

The idea to write a robot Bill Williams is not new and many have said that it is impossible to program analysis system as described in his work, my friend programmer from Russia in mind ethical considerations and respect for procedure BV (I say no trading system) refused to automate. Bill Williams has formalized his method in the books, and I assure you no mystery or something there that he hid from traders not. Why my economist Treasury employees differ from the results of an alcoholic trader? (I've got worse ). It's not about IQ and lack of experience, but simply in the understanding of the system and discipline. Robot eliminate cognitive beliefs and save you from Stresa, you'll manage it themselves as Boing or turn the autopilot.

Hey all, just my 2c opinion on B.W. - I don't use the profitunity strategy except attempting to place very small trades into very long-term trends, which are rare. One thing I believe 100% though, and use for ALL my trading is the 5-candle fractal. The high-levels of fractal-highs are resistance points on the down swing, which become support points on the up swing, and vice-versa. That's just a fact of life, don't leave home without it.

Fractals and their levels are one of the precious few objective things we can say about the markets.

--- 帖子 #1430 ---
I am using 8 different pairs, maybe more as this week progresses. Yes I am watching the equity closely, so far everything is positive... I am attempting to keep  all of the numbers positive as I build the position. One teat will be when the markets make their moves as the week opens, I may get to look silly. lol

I was actually thinking about using the weekly chart, I may still do that.

Definitely fractals can be like the highway signs.

I do not think it is my system of choice, answer to all things; however, the system works for those that want to do the work and exercise discipline with the entries. And that is required of every other system.

Many systems are quite workable and also profitable, many traders do not want to be posting in forums on a regular basis.

There is one trader who has many posts in this thread and who has mastered the technique on a one minute chart, sometimes people judge a system by the thread activity instead of looking at each of the posts to discern what has been happening.

I am not  a person who can trade on one minute charts so I use daily charts....... and see no need to be posting all the time, I don't have much to contribute other than the material that has been posted in the thread many times already.

I think you are probably quite correct... people are just trading and not posting.

hi every one

i have looked theard,it is interesting

but i have a question

i dont understand why did BILL WILLIAM use alligator with sma  periods 13  ,8 ,5 shift  8,5,3?

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
U might read his books to see how he derived the numbers

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
In his first book, BW says that he doesn't use indicators and then proceeds to use them.

What you have to realize is that he uses indicators to determine the Elliott Wave structure.

He trades the structure that the indicators help identify.The Alligator is really good at helping

with this.

No indicator can predict the future but EW gives you a very good idea about what the future

might be like.  If you can get adept at using the BW indicators to interpret the Elliot Wave

structure and then use his strategy for trading it you will be on your way.

As for people who say EW does not work, they are the very people who make it work.

"i dont understand why did BILL WILLIAM use alligator with sma  periods 13  ,8 ,5 shift  8,5,3?"

The alligator average are based in fibonacci´s succession , sma is one fib number and is shift by the previous number in succession.... For this reason many times corrections rebound in lines and this coincide with fibonacci retraces.... sorry for my english

In the book Bill described why selected those options the alligator

Applying the results of their latest research, in the second edition of the book, Bill Williams has updated all methods and new techniques for the profit motive, noting the relevance of the methods described in the first edition of "trading chaos. Expert techniques for maximizing profits. "

The first part of the book is devoted to definitions of psychological principles and rules you need to know for successful trading. Bill Williams creates a psychological basis for professional development of the trader, which is a major factor in the process of implementing and achieving success in the work of the trader.

Elliott Wave theory has been in use in the markets since the 1930’s when R.N. Elliott discovered these repeating patterns in the stock markets. It has been one of the most difficult areas of the market for traders to understand. Profitunity presents the Elliott Wave theory in a simple and effective way that any stock, forex or commodity trader can understand in the new Profitunity Elliott Wave DVD by Justine Williams-Lara.

By understanding the underlying structure of the markets (the Elliott Wave) traders can improve their current trading results. Knowing what direction to expect next and why is especially valuable in today’s volatile markets. Profitunity follows traditional Elliott Wave theory and adds some of their own technical indicators to help ensure an accurate quick and simple count. If you can count to 5 and know your A,B,C’s, then you can learn to count the Elliott Wave the Profitunity way. This method can achieve amazing results and has been used in our own trading accounts for decades.

In this 90-minute course, Justine will teach you how to count the Elliott Wave with simple and precise techniques on real time charts on all time frames and markets including stocks, futures, ETF’s, indices, and Forex.

Justine will also teach you:

• What the Underlying Structure of the Markets is

• What are Fractals and how are they related to the Elliott Wave

• How to use the Awesome Oscillator to find the peak of Wave 3

• Correction types: Zig-Zag, Complex, and Irregular patterns

• How the Elliott Wave is the underlying  structure of all markets

• How the Fractal is the underlying part of the Elliott Wave

• Identify the 5 Wave Pattern with 3 wave correction on the chart on any market

• The Awesome Oscillator - 5-34 moving average and it’s uses

• How to Identify the Wave 3 peak on a chart in seconds

• What divergence means and how it affects the Elliott Waves

• The Squat Bar, trend ending or measuring are explained in real time examples

• What the common correction types are and how to recognize them on the chart

• How to use multiple time frames to accurately count Elliott Waves in real time.

• Take the ambiguity out of counting Elliott Waves

• How to know when your count is wrong and get the current Elliott Wave count.

• Review on 30 examples on historical charts tying it all together.

This DVD is packed with realtime examples to count Elliott Waves. No matter what markets or time frames you trade, new and seasoned traders alike will enhance their trading arsenal. You will fine tune your entries and exits and improve your ability to spot the trend!

YAY A BW THREAD!

I can't really focus or rely on indicators as much in the fx market.... so I resort to mostly Elliot Wave Theory Lately... and Snapped on the right pair... I've been hitting levels perfectly... its like micro macro elliot wave sequencing so the lower timeframes sync with the higher timeframes as far as wave frequency is concerned... so snap on the fibos and BAM!

Anyone else Elliot Waving with Fibos?

Greetings everyone,

I hv read all 3 books and home study course but still a bit confusing counting ABC inside the sequence. Can anyone pioneer here can provide a dvd counting elliot wave profitunity way? It really do help to others. Who should I contact to those who got that dvd?

I think it was on home study videos, waves are reflected on AO/AC histograms

Just analized previous downtrend on AUDNZD, if I had a trade similar to Fed77 tactics on Daily tf from Mar22 to May29, so it came to 6200 pips

I just noticed good signal on this pair, on both Daily chart and Weekly and even though I missed first entry, it's still early and I will catch up with trend.

What I like in this system is you don't need to stick with the same instrument all the time, you can choose anything that get you strong signal and use it, otherwise your trades can be too seldom, but using wider variety of instruments you can get better deals more often.

So I thought if we have number of traders using profitunity, why don't we get together, for example skype chat and share our observations. We could devide market on segments and when each sector have something interesting, others can point their attention to that. Of cause we all make our decisions by ourselves, but it would definitely extend our trading ability or just save time. After all second opinion never hurts

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
I am with you pantera69, let us form a skype group to share our trades and observations. PM me.

Interesting  I sell EURAUD as well

And I see your skype request, we're now connected

The best part of BW is the idea of adding to a winning position, as opposed to scaling out...the latter works against your bottom line, cause your best winners are thin, your losses are full loads.

I like the second book, meaning you keep adding to a trend...look at some of those loong forex trends in majours...if you keep adding on every chaos signal, and run through most of the swing, you hit a thick homerun.

The problem is filtering those good old sleepy alligators, thex will eat away the profits....

Conclusion: folter with eEW,Fibos in price, and specially in fibos  time...

make sure you have thick winners, reduce your loosers, reduce your loosing size...and you are a winner..

All the best

Hi,

I'm using the Profitunity system on majors. I mainly use the fractals for buy/sell opportunities and then add to positions if there is a trend and more signals are 'hit'. Does anyone else actively and consistently use the 3 wise men of Bill Williams for forex trading?

Would be interested to hear from other people who use Bill Williams currently.

--- 帖子 #1469 ---
i read your posr but i have a question

why do bill williams use 5 bar analysis?

i dont understand ,why dont use 1 bar, 2 bar,3 bar,10 bar

Now there's a big problem with this system. I see the indicators and price moving in totally opposite directions the indicators say it moves one way and price moves the other.

http://i.imgur.com/OXTG7GZ.jpg

The first fractal i circled in light blue shows that it is well outside the alligator jaw in red. The awesome oscillator in red shows that it's decreasing yet if you observe the price bars on this daily chart it's going upwards instead of downwards so it's totally against what the signals indicate.

Maybe the 1st one isn't that good because the jaw, mouth and lips are tightly meshed together yet the 2nd one i circled in red is worse.

If you observe the alligator now the lips,teeth and jaw have all seperated which means the mouth is open. The fractal is pointing downwards and both oscillators are red so this indicates a downwards trend yet notice where does price move. It moves upwards instead. You see what happens when you have like all 3 indicators pointing downwards but price moves upwards instead.

Why is this so?

Did i read the chart wrongly or are the oscillators somehow wrong. 3 in a row wrong mind you.

--- 帖子 #1477 ---
I`m afraid, you completely misunderstood the system!!!!! The fractals are NOT indicators, don`t point anywhere. They are just the indicating the last low or last high. And the method teaches to NOT trade, but set a pending order with due distance to this fractal. So for the blue circled fractal (which is only indicated after the following two candles have finished) you should have placed a pending SELL order a few pips below the low of that candle (the one that shows the blue circle).

You would place that order at the same time when the third following candle opens ( the hammer). So the order is pending - but nothing happening with this (blue)order. At the beginning of the candle circled red you will notice 2 things: Your BLUE sell order was triggered (maybe even one day earlier) and a new pivot indicator was printed (the one three days earlier with that long white candle and pivot indicator above). So you set a new LONG pending order a a price a few pips above the highest high of that white candle (ca. 1.278x).

At the last day the red circled pivot will be printed and you place a new SELL pending order  at about 1.235x.

So you have now 1 running order (not yet stopped out, but wide profit), and 2 pending orders

Actually a nice setup. So read the books.

p.s. this was only about the fractals.

I have a simplistic approach that says if there is no trend, go to another chart.

You have picked a ranging market to analyze and there is so many posts that say do not feed the alligator.. if those lines are close together and you enter a trade, for sure you will get eaten.

This is a trend following system 'no slope - stay out'

--- 帖子 #1481 ---
I didn't actually put in any orders. I was observing it. OK but what about the awesome oscillator?

It points downwards but price moves upwards.

If you observe it you can see i have a sell order instead of a buy and you look at the awesome oscillator it moves downwards red getting bigger. it's supposed to be a sell but price moves up instead.

Ok according to what they teach when you see a fractal point out that is outside of the alligator teeth the red line you can either buy or sell but it's like 1 pip above. Isn't that what is taught. You see the one circled in red. It's pointing downwards. You can put in a sell because everything clicks. The awesome oscillator is moving downwards it all indicates a sell but you can see price moving upwards so if you put in a sell below that fractal circled in red you would be in a losing position.

Ok about the one circled in blue. Yes the pending sell below would be ok. It wouldn't hit until 7 days later. You can count the candles 6 candles above the pending sell on the candle with the fractal pointing down. Price then shoots past downwards that's ok just a long wait.

The one in red doesn't make sense. I need to repeat this because there's something wrong. Fractal pointing downwards. OK it's supposed to be a pending sell below but i can see the candles afterwards didn't do below that fractal line.

All right that's an open trade from last friday. It's a continuning sell. That means it was shooting downwards last week. I was selling. I put in a sell stop there last week as an added on position. I think on the 23 i saw a fractal pointing downwards and i wanted to add on. I don't recall exactly.

Anyway the awesome oscialltor is pointing downwards not upwards so it's still wrong since price is moving in an opposite direction from it.

--- 帖子 #1482 ---
Ok the blue fractal cirlced was in a ranging market because the alligator jaws are shut but the one circled in red the jaws are open it's a trending market right? The AO is moving. Let me post it again. Can you explain to me how it is ranging when the alligator jaws are open and the AO is increasing. The fractal circled in red

http://i.imgur.com/OXTG7GZ.jpg

--- 帖子 #1483 ---
i dont think u understand about fractals.. the pointing arrow IS NOT a sign that show whether market will going up or down. You are now align with what bill william said "Follow what the market wants.. not what you want the market to be".

Fractals act as well as a support and resistance line for your to trigger buy or sell.. if you want to buy or sell you wanna to refer fractals for the pending order price.

--- 帖子 #1484 ---
I think I'm going to resurrect this thread at the start of the year. Should I do it?

--- 帖子 #1485 ---
I am a Fractal Junky. There are a few You Tube Videos online where Bill Williams explains his Chaos Method of trading. The "Holy Grail" is the best one.

It explains what a fractal is and how they are formed. Now, I have taken his knowledge and the research that he paid to have done about the market, and added my own perks. I've thrown is some VSA , Some knowledge about Euro Trading Levels for Breakouts, and Added the Fibonacci Levels to my approach at trading. It is quiet impressive.

A Fractal is nothing more than a Behavioral change in the Market. Smart Money( high volume candles) is what makes the Fractal's behavior change. That change in behavior is headed somewhere, but where? It is headed to a Fib Level that the Market Makers and Smart Money have in mind , that's where.

There are 4 basic levels that the Euro Market Makers and Smart Money use as Breakout areas. They are associated in the last 2 digits of the Euro Price, for example 1.2100,1.2120,1.2150,1.2180. The last 2 digits 00-20-50-80. These areas are where you will find the magical Fractal and Breakouts. Repainting Fractals have nothing to do with anything , concerning a potential trade!!! All is based on SR levels and volume and where the price is headed.

Unless you understand what a Fractal represents and why they are on your chart, you are just lost.

I might add that the 21 EMA level is an essential point of concern and a Line in the Sand. A lot of decision making goes on when the currency price is at that level. A trend is usually established at that point, although the prices don't normally wonder to far away from that line in the sand. These Breakout are usually good for 30-80 pips on a 1 hour chart and take 5-6 hours to climax. I'm the conservative type, and usually take profit in the 30-40 pip range(2-3 hrs), with only a 15-20 SL in place. It gives me a 1:1.5 ratio, although it probably works out to be more like a 3:1 .

I trade a live account, wouldn't do it if I couldn't make money. I have traded Demo account and researched endless hours for the magical Indicators or an EA that would make some money. It's not out there Folks. It has to be in your Brain. You have to know what these Rascals are up to at all times. The trading does come easy now. I just set a Take Profit and a Stop Loss using 2% of my money trading a .15 lot for now and bring in a couple of trades a day, with very few losing trades. My Nest Egg will grow, but I really don't thing I have the nerve to trade anything more than a .5 lot size, regardless of my Bank Account size.A hundred Dollar Bill on the Stop Loss would be just about all I would what to surrender on any given trade. Still, at $5 pips and 50-60 pips / day, that will render @200-$300/day x21 days,-apprx. 30% tax with holding.

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
One other thing. I don't use the Awesome or Accelerator , or the Gator Indicator. Waste of time. Lagging Indicators. You need current info, such as volume(ticks) and the destination of the train( Fib Lines) your on in real time. Forget everything else. I do use a RSI set At 10 and crossing at 35-50-65 levels for reassurance purposes.

Gotta no how and where to place a Fib setup from the Left of the Chart. Good Luck to Ya all.

--- 帖子 #1487 ---
Correctio!!!!! No magic indicators...  understanding price action is the way to rewards.

I do use some of the BW indicators, probably from habit.

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
The first book I bought was Trading Chaos. I was a rank newbie. I bought the whole chaos thing.

Then, I bought NTD. Again, I was amazed. But THEN I found out the AO and AC was a just a MACD split into histogram form. I was so pissed off that I threw the whole thing in the trash. Slowly I continued to evolve, until I reached bar by bar proficiency. Then an amazing thing happened.

I realized that I had seen it all before!

Profitunity has got the be one of the corniest bunch of marketing BS ever made by man. But what Bill was trying to do is break price action into bite sized pieces. There is indeed information to be had on every price bar. The trick is putting it together, and making the correct executive decisions to be profitable. In the end the five dimensions, along with the money management have to be made into your own system. I can say with confidence however that bar by bar price action is correctly read with the Profitunity indicators.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is one of my trading charts. It's a 15 min chart. I have attached the Bill William's Market Facilitation Index, There is also a Trend Oscillator that I pick up off the Nihilist  Thread.  The Purple line is a Kijun Sen  support and resistance Indicator. It's a pretty simple method of trade. The key to trading Forex is Patience, something that I sometimes struggle with. You really can read the Market flow with the MFI, once you get familiar with color coding of the bars and what they stand for. Again, you just have to be patient and wait until the Fractal breakout occurs. This is a pretty good trend indicator also, based on the ADX I believe.

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
The Kijun Sen line = equals Red Gator line. Simple indicaton of the trend. Only trade with the trend. Price below-Sell, Price above-Buy.

--- 帖子 #1492 ---
I wonder why Profitunity does not attract more attention?

I think it's because Bill Williams expanded his total trading system over three books and two very expensive video series.

Just trying to spark a discussion here. I could easily start another thread, but there is no point in doing that.

--- 帖子 #1493 ---
I think many people still use the system, however, people get tired of a system and try another, and then return.

People look for the holy grail and think it is in the next system, and then they think it is in the next system and so on.

Myself, I use some of the indicators and do not like the others.

I automated the system using some weird combinations on alligator and awesome , the thing works well.....

I am sure that if you post some charts on a regular basis that you will have some comments, getting the traffic started is the hurdle.

--- 帖子 #1494 ---
That's exactly what I did. For no good reason. Just got bored. One fine day I remembered that everything I was using I had seen before. So I returned to the source. I agree that most people today using some part of BW, if only just the fractals.

--- 帖子 #1495 ---
All Bills signals repaint except the Fractal which isnt really his signal to begin with.

That being said his wave count theory when used with other methods can produce profitable insights.

However, in trading "those who cant do teach." I think this applies to these folks.

--- 帖子 #1496 ---
I just read and implement the Bill Williams Theory based on his book <Trading Chaos> Second Edition, in this book he introduce the Alligator, Divergent Bar, Awesome Oscillator, and Fractal.

To Be honest, I have read about the alligator indicator, how this indicator in the trending environment can get a lot of profit but then I have never really into it, instead I use another method and Indicator, DMI, ADX, Stoch, Moving Average Cross, etc. After some journey and adventures and losses after losses, I start using Moving Average Cross over, my first setup is SMA 13 and SMA 5 and using M30 and H1, at first it quite profitable and then the ranging market coming in, the signal start to be shaggy and false signal comes in alot. Therefore I add another Base line MA using SMA 60, so if price is below SMA 60 it is down trend and only take sell signal from SMA13 and SMA 5 Cross. IF Price above SMA 60 I only take Buy Signal.

From this second method it work quite well also for sometimes, and then I notice.. this system also create losses, the reason is... IF the market create a high bound range that is swinging above and below SMA 60 (The Baseline MA) the signal created from SMA13 and SMA5 cross becomes invalid, because the price fluctuate so high and MA is just to slow to adapt. I Start adding another and another baseline MA...thus making me sick just to look at the monitor.

The reason of my losses is I can't see where the real trend is, and the most important thing I enter using Market Execution, so when the price move fast, I jump in on the wagon without second thought, and after that the price reverse (False Breakout).

Alligator help determine the trend, and avoid ranging market, and Bill Williams Method helps on preventing impulsive trading because his system mostly using Stop Order. My Guess is by using stop order, B.W Implement the momentum of the market, so if we put Stop Order, the market have a power or force and the will to reach higher or Lower.

Image in the attachment is my current setup. just for your reference.

What was the entry trigger on that chart?

I guess with 0.01 you didn't lose much; I don't see the stop loss?

Thanks, John

--- 帖子 #1498 ---
Yeah, I don't use bigger lot since this is testing, if I'm feeling good and discipline I will increase the Lot

The entry on that chart is based on another technical analysis using Fibonacci Fan Retracement, I closed the trade soon after get profit and reading the AUD Bad news about the Employment.

here is today chart for AUD JPY, the entry is using SELL STOP on the fractal.

--- 帖子 #1499 ---
Hello everyone!

I've read all three of Bill Williams' books and I'm making some nice profits already, although I'm still learning and making some mistakes.

Now I have a question for all of you guys who use this system. In New Trading Dimensions the first signal to take is the fractal and after this you take all signals in that direction. Then in Trading Chaos 2 you use a divergent bar as your first signal and add on with the AO and the fractal. The question is, being your very first entry a divergent bar, do you add on with all of the signals explained in both books (saucer, AC, Zone etc) or only with the Super AO and Fractal? Do you trade with the books as being two different trading methods or do you combine everything together?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1500 ---
i will trade the latest one book (trading chaos 2) as per home study course

--- 帖子 #1501 ---
Very good question; too bad you never got an answer. I think just start off with the BW basics and be patient can pay off big time. For example, Fractals -

Fractals

Fractals generate the following signals:

• If a buy fractal is above the Alligator's teeth (the red line) we would place a Buy Stop one tick above the high of the up fractal;

• If a sell fractal is below the Alligator's teeth (the red line) we would place a Sell Stop one tick below the low of the fractal sell signal.

• We would not take a buy if a fractal is formed below the Alligator's teeth.

• We would not take a sell if a fractal is formed above the Alligator's teeth.

Fractals are valid until they are either triggered or a new fractal in the same direction appears (in this case the previous signal has to be ignored and the pending order has to be deleted).

Hello All,

Dear FED77 I am using the indicators you have posted. Is there any way to change the color of the FIBO LEVELS of

indicator 1-2-3 Pattern MTF v3.1.mq4. The color of the Fibo can be changed but I couldn't find the line relating to the color of the FIB LEVELS they are YELLOW, and I'd rather use a white background.

Hi guys!

Haven't been here in forever, used to post on this system years ago when I really started learning it.

Until today I am still actively trading it, and loving it, too  With enough patience, this system being applied correctly can make you the profits you desire .. to underline this and the above quote I am attaching a current trade this system has provided. It's on USD/CAD and a weekly TF, this may seem extremely long for some of you, but it produces nice trends.

--- 帖子 #1504 ---
I'm still doing it too, my login used to be Green River but I lost my login, hence the new handle. Slight's weekly approach has kept him in the game making money (good to hear you're around Slight). For awhile there I think most were frustrated in the daily charts as seen in the historic under performance of trend following managers. I took 3 years off (from full time trading) but I'm starting up again now. Here's to 2016!

--- 帖子 #1505 ---
Hey Cirrus! Good to hear from you, I wrote an email to you a while ago, but it didn't get delivered.

Weekly trading is advisable these days, esp. since I am using the method for trendfollowing only - no BDBs or anything. You are right saying that underperformance was visible with hedge funds using the approach, too. However, that's the nature of the game and can happen anytime again... The weekly is the best timeframe to do trendfollowing in my opinion, seems market noise has found it's way from intraday charts onto the daily timeframe  You just need a lot of patience to trade so high up there.

--- 帖子 #1506 ---
Welcome back slight. seem this Chaos trading will come to alive again. I have question, why you not use BDB again ?

--- 帖子 #1507 ---
Hi!

BDB is for top and bottom fishing. Not what the system is designed to do, it's a trend trading system. They are also not profitable in the long run when used as entries.

That's why I never use them, only sometimes for exits when there is huge angulation between the moving averages and price.

Thanks for share your system! Can you please upload a .tpl file so can be more easy for us to install it? Ty ^^

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
It's not his template. It's been developed by Profitunity.

You can easily apply the indicators using the what seems the most popular charting platform: Metatrader 4. They are buildt-in: Alligator, Fractals, Aweseome Oscillator.

PLEASE TELL ME WHAT THE PURPLE LINE IN ...... itradeAIM is.

Looks like MA of some sort

can you share the parameters with me please

you could always buy the system, you may find out then.....

just a thought....

--- 帖子 #1512 ---
These signals all repaint and are statistically proven to not give an edge. Really wonder why some still follow this.

--- 帖子 #1513 ---
Repaint? Within 11 years I haven`t noticed this once. Statistically proven it won`t work? Show me the proof. Why still use it? Maybe we just make money?

--- 帖子 #1514 ---
Repaint is like a expression used by people that do not understand that almost all things repaint to some extent. And it doesn't matter because real traders are using the price bars for entry and the indicators for entries.

Generally it is lack of understanding trading that causes people to remark re repaint.

--- 帖子 #1515 ---
I purchased Profitunity's course in the mid 2000's and studied and followed the methods intensely; also had regular conversations with Justine, Bills daughter.

I will paste a quote from another trader who used Bills method and used to be regular on this site, he also did the private mentoring.  "Dr. Bill Williams made some changes a few years ago. He does not use the AC or the Zone add-ons any longer. He uses just the AO and now the RSI only, set at 80/20 with a period of 9.

He also added another simple moving average (the purple line) set at 6 with a displacement at 3. This is used to exit. If you have 2 bars that close below the purple line, the exit would be one tick below the lowest bar (if long) or one tick above the highest bar (if short). You can also use the green line if a bar closes below (long) it or above it (short). He uses the purple line close as he says it can keep him in the trend longer which it does."

If you have been trading this for 11 years and haven't noticed the AO or AC repaint I dont know what to say. That's another problem in entirety.

What I will mention is that this was at first designed for stocks, and with the rapid influence and changes in market behavior now done by algo's and black boxes I dont have any more reason to follow this.

If by some reason this method is winning for you then I would say keep at it and happy profits.

I have never met one profitable trader using these methods, but then again, I have never met many profitable retail traders.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1516 ---
I have made a few dollars with the system trading manually. and a few more with an EA that I made.

Many retail traders make some profits..... few of them disclose.

hi guys .. i been trading for n years and i tried lots of trading strategies and blah blah blah !!

for god sake if u actually read bill williams book u find that at least 2/3 of his books are about psychology aspect of trading .. i wonder why ?

he specifically says "there's no holy grail in trading" and after that he start to talk about 3 wise man signals ... do u get whats going on ?

if u experience enough u most already know that u need a "well written mechanical strategy" to trade cause human beings are prone to systemical errors

and we need to strategies to avoid them & bill williams gives us a AtoZ strategy ! that's good enough for me . it has price action & momentum in it and thats

just enough . beside that in all of his work u can see he's talking about market structure and elliott waves.

i know this for sure if u got good grasp of wave on analysis to found that where u are right now (correction or impulse) u can make money with alligator alone.

so stop complaining about strategies and try to look for loosing behaviors in urself.

p.s : it need some little adjustment to each instrument. for example i dont do add to position thingy using AO when i trade USOIL in m5 . or i personally use 2 pip

instead of 1 pip for below bar stops

--- 帖子 #1518 ---
Any system is profitable provided one gets out early from losers and let the winners run.That's it.

Having said that Bill Williams not using his own original indicators anymore AO AC already speaks volumes about his system.

Most people don't realize that almost all Oscillators are based on moving averages so placing 3 MA's on the chart then adding 2 oscillators saying the same is overkill.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
so there's two things :

1) it doesnt matter if B . W using his tool to trade or not cause we dont know whats he's after , as long as i know he's claiming he's tools are still profitable. thats all matters

2)i agree with u abuot over using MA s but if u read his last book he said signal which produced with 3 wise man (fractal - AO & alligator) are have 99.5%  confidence level like signals created by their mainframe computer using nonlinear feedback calculus(exact word from book)

--- 帖子 #1520 ---
After BDB bar and some Wise Man signals by the manual, when in profit, what is the exit strategy? One manual I've read states only the initial SL at the BDB extremum. Does one move this SL in some way along the move, or just wait for an opposite BDB to exit? Or maybe use the Alligator lines for exit like in the earlier BW system?

--- 帖子 #1521 ---
Bill Williams fractals and alligator is a great strategy although I have modified it to my trading style of sell the highs and buy the lows.

I personally get much better results.

I use it for day scalping.

I get in on 15min and I get out on 5min.

When price breach a fractal high or low from a pervious high or low on 15min i place orders to sell in bullish or buy in a bearish usually around 20 to 30 pips apart

and I close around the 50 ema-100ematouch on 5min.

Trades can take anywhere between 1hour and 24hours to close and I don't use stops.

Anybody want to see this in action who does not understand fractals and alligator go to trading 212 open a demo, apply fractals @ 5 and add alligator and 100ema and 200ema.

Easy pips traders.

Hats of to chaos trading.

--- 帖子 #1522 ---
Important to make the strategy fit to your perspective of the market, good job!

But no stops?? Buying when bearish, selling when bullish??

Hm ..

--- 帖子 #1523 ---
Thanks.

No stops, I know it is not to every traders cup of tea but I hate them, I can't stand them.

If you buy in bullish with bill Williams it requires trailing stop or ATR to which I would only use ATR and it will be set at 4 to be taken of the candle prior to the break which is extremely accurate.

But like so many trading posts I read on fx factory this question always appears, &quot; where do I get out&quot;?

So by selling in bullish you have Ema's as targets. And by buying in bearish again you have EMA targets.

The fractal needs to be a good distance away from EMA, to begin with, and once a trade is placed I grid orders above if selling and below if buying usually 20-30 pips apart and  close trades at EMA,s this way I get 10 or so opportunitys for easy trades a day over multiple pairs.

Just set alerts at the break, receive an sms , place trade and orders, go for a coffee

--- 帖子 #1524 ---
dear Hippiedog,

Thanx for sharing ur technique,  my only question is that do u use any mental stops if market goes violently against you or do you wait for 5 mt ema to hit? Do u also use this technique in commodities?

Thanx

--- 帖子 #1525 ---
Scalp on a 1 minute or 5 minute time frame , and only go by the fractals, baseline, and alligator.    Set your target at $31.25 (bonds), or $40-$50 (YM and Gold 100oz).  And double or triple the stop loss.    Trade  between 830-1000am Central time, and 2pm-3pm Central Time.

I know this goes against the let your winners run, be in it for the long haul, and use the Elliot Wave (with which you can justify staying in all kinds of losing trades).

I think BW came up with his bdb (wiseman 1), zone, super ao(wiseman 2), ao saucer, ao divergence, 3232 accelerator (wiseman 3), and baseline/balance line to justify writing more books.   And except baseline (which is a failed fractal), those new strategies/indicators are not worth the trouble.    And he uses hourly and longer time frames because it is more convenient for folks to peek at the market while they are at work.

I've just finished all 77 pages in here.   Nice to see that it isn't just me that doesn't get the elliot wave, doesn't trust fibonacci, has the market go to exactly his stop loss and reverse, and has the same confusion over BW's books.

BTW, this is my 1st post

--- 帖子 #1526 ---
"you don't need to count elliot waves, you have the alligator.........", day 4 week eleven of 12 week home study package, Bill Williams .

--- 帖子 #1527 ---
I Think Bill WiLliam strategy is great.. I use fractal breakout as my main Entry and direction of trades is determined by Alligator, as in his book it says it Work as  a "compass".

But instead of entering when a fractal get hit, I enter when candle closes beyond the fractal which ensures the volatility/momentum needed for a break out. I think of a fractal as a short term S/R because it is the highest or the lowest from the last five bars.

--- 帖子 #1528 ---
The alligator was Bill's way of trying to get people to understand impulse vs. reaction. Don't trade reactive waves. Trade only impulse waves. Fibonacci, pivots, Murrey/Gann lines do not have any meaning in and of themselves, so you do not need to "trust" them.  They are just consistent lines in the sand so a trader can make decisions to trade off of. Any system of these kinds of indicators depends upon price action at it's core.

The AO is a 5/34 MACD and the AC is a 5 period moving average of the that MACD.

The zones concept is useful for money management techniques.

--- 帖子 #1529 ---
So what time frame does everyone use?

How much did his first book originally cost?   I didn't buy it because the manager for my 1st job out of college was named "Bill Williams".

​Hello.  If anyone is interested in this method please join me here:  https://join.skype.com/Kbk9m3ocqEzd

--- 帖子 #1531 ---
BDB Bull/Bear Divergent Bar  Just  like the Key Reversal Bar, they stick out at every market turn.   So I used my spreadsheet program to search for all the  Bull Bear Divergence bars, and the key reversal bars.   Guess what?   They show up all the time!   They're  just more conspicuous at the market turns!!

And that is GREAT!  As in GREATLY USELESS !!

And as for timeframes, I'm beginning to think it is best to trade the one that shows the hungriest most active alligator.   From what I've been able to glean from the internet, BW and Justine use all kinds of time frames but never lower that 5 minutes?

Volume and Range time frames can be deceiving during high volatility.   Sure you get nice signals, but the market moves too fast to enter in a stop order or limit order.

Wisemen pyramiding BW style is also worthless.   In BW's first book, Trading Chaos (1995) he covers air bag trades and thumb trades.    Has anyone found these useful?

Maybe it is just me, but I think that only the fractal , baseline, and alligator have any usefulness.

--- 帖子 #1532 ---
Context is by far the most difficult thing to teach with a trading method. If you are going use bill's methods, context is important.

Watch for trading opportunities when you are in a grey zone, start to see BDB bars, and a collapsing alligator. If you see a TF with an open alligator you are late. Wait until the alligator goes back to sleep.

Nothing in a chart is useless. Every bar gives information. What Bill did was to package well known market concepts into a course that newbies can take and understand.

I cannot say much about pyramiding. He has changed this a few time. I would just add a trading unit each time I get a signal.

In his first book he discussed air bag stops, not trades. Thumb trades were his early version of fractal trades.

--- 帖子 #1533 ---
Airbags = stops, and Thumbs = fractals?

Maybe I was too critical, it is just that there is so much boiler plate double-talk nonsense in technical analysis.    Maybe I'll do some  historical trading to check out the congested alligator for entries.    I like the "grab $35 and run" strategy.   What a book title!

Inserted Video    35 minutes into the video , it shows tick charts and how things are obscured when looking at a longer time frame.   In short, the devil is in the details.

--- 帖子 #1534 ---
That's a very interesting video! The part where one firm moving the market. Well that created a gap. That gap will fill. Further, looking at that chart, there was a downtrend in progress long before that event. Broken fractals and zone trades all the way down. Actually if you do not like the way Bill talks, use some one else. All of it is price action redefined.

--- 帖子 #1535 ---
Bill Williams is ok, except he has the same name as that %^&* manager that I worked for fresh out of college.

Bill's fractal , alligator , baseline strategy is the only thing I like in technical analysis.   Double stochastics 24 and 10 with a 4 tick range chart shows promise.   But the alligator/fractal/baseline is more consistent and straight forward.   The rest of technical analysis is all  double talk to me.

I think longer time frames lose a lot of resolution

--- 帖子 #1536 ---
My latest idea:

Trade on a 1 minute time frame for  ZN, ES, and 6E.  Only use the fractal strategy and the Smoothed Moving

Average 2 of stochastic 34 %K of the stochastic 34 %k of closing price of the 1 minute bar oscillator.

Buy trigger is the oscillator turns up after scraping on the bottom, and the candlestick crosses above the 5 bar average of typical price.  And the 5 bar average has a positive slope.     It works great if a fractal is involved.

Does anyone trade livestock futures anymore?   I use to love Live Hogs but they look like they lost the liquidity.  And they changed them to lean hogs which messed up my strategy.  It was sell after 4 up days in a row, buy after 3 down days in a row.   Each days' change greater than 1 tick, and less than 1 point.   And stay away from the cold storage report.    It use to work great.   God must  really like me or something?

Jake Bernstein, Wells Wilder, Marty Zweig and Larry Williams got nothing on me.    Bill Williams does.  And P Q Wall was way way out there.

--- 帖子 #1537 ---
I have just been playing around with alligator and this really simple entry exit strategy appeared just by adding the 5 EMA enter long when 5 EMA crosses above alligator jaws and enter short when 5EMA crosses below alligator jaws.

Close your position when 5EMA crosses alligator lips in opposite direction.

That is easy pips.

--- 帖子 #1538 ---
Hi Hippidog, I like to enter when the candle (HA Candle) close below or above the jaw. Sometimes I end up a little early but be patient.

--- 帖子 #1539 ---
lips  = jaws??

--- 帖子 #1540 ---
Jaws are the blue line the longest MA and the Lips are the green line which is the shortest MA and the red line is the Teeth the middle MA.

--- 帖子 #1541 ---
No, that is not correct. MACD by definition uses exponential moving averages. The AO use simple moving averages.

--- 帖子 #1542 ---
blue=jaws=belly=the longest ma  (blue belly? get it?)

ya green= the shortest ma, alligator's lips can be green.

But what time frame, tick count, volume, or any other suggestion should I use??

I still have not put together ten  $100 gross (not counting commissions) trading days in a row.

A lot of my intraday/scalping trend catching trades are based around the alligator and fractal levels as buy/sell entries and the AO as a divergence heads up.  I don't take every signal the book says to take, though.  Just a couple of fractal level breakouts at a time.

--- 帖子 #1551 ---
There is a bearish 3d Wise Man and 5th Dimension signal on the daily chart of GBPUSD. Which signal do you like the most?

--- 帖子 #1552 ---
Thanx for the reply.

What TF you work with?

In my approach I coordinate signals in 5m and 1m charts to look for my entries using only fractal levels as triggers and the alligator and AO as compasses.

--- 帖子 #1561 ---
Hi To all, my question is is the chaos trading system good, is it valid?, did it perform well to you by following its rules, no deviations from rules nor discounts nor adding indicators but as it is? Or is another one to sell books and coaching?

I am sorry for being so direct but after reading the thread i would like to know at least if there is someone who still trades it and fits to its personality.

--- 帖子 #1562 ---
The big misconception is that what makes the system successful are the indicators.  That is false.  The system is about adding on aggressively when a market breaks out and then trends.  So to do it properly, you need a sufficient account size to add-on and still not risk too much of the account.  So if you adhere to the rules 100%, you're adding on when each indicator gives a signal.  And each of the indicators have multiple setups for signals.

Having said that, the system was designed for daily charts during a period when markets only trended 15-20% of the time and the rest of the time were relatively flat.  Forex, obviously isn't like that.  So you'll need to find an instrument and timeframe where the indicators and setups make sense.  I found 15 min. charts and trading the London open to be the best.

--- 帖子 #1563 ---

--- 帖子 #1566 ---
Anyone still using this system successfully?

I started using it but i found very discouraging that the main objective is to counter trend while in the past the alligator was actually used to always trade with the trend. I'm having a hard time to get into the 1st candle that start the trend, also the AO being the biggest position size turned me off, since this is very unreliable.  Fractals that used to be the most reliable are no longer.  This is why i'm looking of someone is still having success trading the same as the book 2ed implies or i should just keep looking an other alternative.

--- 帖子 #1567 ---

hey booker..... the chaos system works, or at least does for me..... but only in a weekly trend following manner then using the lower timeframes for entrys.... aka, top down approach.... the only indicators i use are the alligator, awesome, and fractals......

the ac, mfi and others are to fickle for me..... i do not like rules that require 'user discretion'.....

there will be draw downs at the trend changes......h

Maximizing profits and MM.

Like I mentioned im a fan of B. Williams, he wrote 3 books, and what I do is pick up the best from each, (in my opinion), after backtesting them.

Check this EURAUD 12 Hour chart, (I use a period converter), I like 12 hours, not too slow, and almost as reliable as a Daily...but giving me more opportunities.

Actually I took this trade, made 1,8 R which is fine...but my question is: how can I make the most of every one of my winners. (basic trading principle).

To be continued...

--- 帖子 #1574 ---
Here´s the original Day chart.

Note the High of the 18th of June.

Time, Price, Momentum and Pattern all are aligned for a short campaign.

--- 帖子 #1575 ---
And here´s the potential campaign:

Entries are numbered in PINK. (1,2,3,4).

Using the pyramiding tactics of BW last book.
1- 1/5 of my R (my personal risk size).
2 - The full R.
3- 4/5
4- 3/5
5- 2/5.

1- Is a bearish divergent bar, from Bill Williams last book.

Using the pyramiding tactics of the same book.That entry takes only 1/5 of my R (my personal risk size).
2-Is a jurikMA average cross on the 4 H TF.
3-Is a bearish reversal of the DTOSC 8 in the chart, after the potential eow2.
4-Is the fractal break of the potential w1.
5.Is a conservative entry, at the eow4, with a stop at the eow2.

Using something similar from B.W first book, take profit on the biggest lot at the first 13 DTOSC reversal, which coincided with the end of w3. (Buy 2)

Then close all the rest at a conservative eow5. (Buy 1345)

Same campaign potential results: 5,96 R. (almost 3 times more profit for the same swing), using only logical entries and exits.

And here´s the 12 H chart for ilustration:

--- 帖子 #1576 ---
let this be clear

chaos theory and fractals has nothing to do with multiple dimensions or the fractality of the price itself. It is just a HH LL breakout strategy.

Bill seems talented to tell a good story to back this strat up, but it is not the HG, it's not even profitable

--- 帖子 #1577 ---
Let me give you a clue on Ellliot Wave, something I found extremely usefull:

Start your analysis on the MONTHLY chart!

Even if you daytrade, start with the monthly and work your EW down.It tends to give you a clearer perspective.

My humble 2 cents anyway.

--- 帖子 #1578 ---
All 3 are very usefull.

BUT you need to figure the whole thing by yourself.

Good day,

How to trade your indicator ?

May you kind enough to explain to us,..

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #1582 ---
Hello friend... this indicator i made specially for trading chaos strategy by: Bill Williams, many information forex market & signal in there, if you had read the book from Mr.prof Bill, u will be understand.

1. Alligator Trade Assistant : there are information How many pips distance from close price to Moving Average ( Alligator indicator )

2. C/strength : this information for How strong individual currency in real time

3. RSI Average : this information fot How strong Relative Stregnth Index in 13 day ( 13 day thats mean for calculated Elliotwave  ) & Momentum change

4. Candle indicator : Red Bar  thats mean stronger for Bearish moving, Green Bar thats stronger for Bullish moving, Dot Green thats mean for entry with buystop or sell stop ( beacuse they are  crosing in the zero line AO or AC ) & the last is Dot Red means maybe but not always , signal for anticipation the trend will be pullback or maybe the trend is over

--- 帖子 #1583 ---
Hi @ ac3w,

you have posted a useful indicator!

But I do not see the colored candles and the Trade Assistant !?

Here I post an indicator with histograms between the Alligator lines.

In the chart I also drew (for another system) the AO averages 5/34.

hi ac3w,

how to adjust this alligator trade assistant?

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
Opss!! next time iwill be repair for public, bcause am building this indicator specially only for my PC lol, please pardon me. wkwk

--- 帖子 #1600 ---
thanks ,this is very nice system.

--- 帖子 #1601 ---
ac3w, thanks for your tools.

--- 帖子 #1602 ---
Fortunately I am no young trader! But I will make intensive use of your BW tools again - right now I only use the mt4 standard BW template to judge the market. I only hope, it will not degrade at higher timeframes - I use D1, W1 and even monthly bars.

So thanks again

--- 帖子 #1603 ---
Swingman, do you consider an addition of the TDI indicator (Big E - Trading Made Simple thread) a good, viable and produceable idea?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1604 ---
I have no experience with TDI. But in Trading Made Simple(r) I saw that one waived TDI.

One can probably do good trades with CCI or Woodie, Stochastic, simple RSI etc.

Important is the experience of the trader and not the indicators, so you are the master!

--- 帖子 #1605 ---
Hello,

can you post that swingman chaos trend mode indicator?

Thanks.

im using it Swingman sir,i am also recently started using OP indicator ,its very good,i was always a big fan of outside bar or engulfing bar,thanks for all contribution,its highly appreciated that we get it for free.

--- 帖子 #1608 ---
That's nice to know!

What I mean is that so far no one has posted a chart where one can see how the indicator has worked.

Maybe I have other not yet posted tools, but there is no reason to post them.

--- 帖子 #1609 ---
Hi T4Trade,

What indicator you use that draw up and down arrows on the chart? Could you share it?

--- 帖子 #1610 ---
it is agimat 2020 system,it works like a semafor and it repaints,the only way to trade with this is to use other indicators for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #1611 ---
Finally found a way to make "chaos money".

You need Dynamic trader software though!!

Here´s a weekly chart, AUDUSD.

DT has a swing file function, where you can create and manipulate swings. So first I create a swing file, using the oscillator as a guide.

Then I mark the last swing and using 2 statistical routines from the software, I let it plot time areas, where statistically 80% of the last say 10 swings, the trend changed (as well as the oscillator).

The routines are called Tyme Rythm Zones, and Time Bands. Those are the colored segments in the oscillator window below.

Then I draw a "time square", where both routines overlap in the future.

As you can see from the squares, drawn from the previous little colored arrows, and previous swings, those squares are quite accurate.I could show you dozens of similar hits.

Once the time is reached, I go to the daily chart, wait for a DIVERGENCE in the oscillator, and take the first divergence signal.

THEN, I add aggressively using the First Chaos edition Book techniques, (Zones/AO, AC, Balance Line, and fractals.)

And ride the wave till the next weekly square. I also use a lot of EW and Fibos in time and price. It just works.

Adding aggresively using chaos makes my winners bigger, and my losers (fewer lots entered), smaller.

--- 帖子 #1612 ---
Check this trade: AUDNZD, on a 12 Hour Bar (2 bars per day)

-Weekly OSC was OB

-Weekly Time Box was on (meaning statistical week swing high, time, was reached).

- WM1 Bar was DIVERGENT (very important filter, no divergence, no Wise Man in my book).

-After the first entry, I use BOTH BOOKS entries, all lots same size, same risk in $ to stop.

-WM1, WM2; WM3 from the second edition, AND all the other ones from the first edition.

-This campaign was 10 short entries, from the WM 1 till the place in the chart where I wrote "STOP adding."

-Once the daily Oscillator is OS (shown by the green bar below the DTF 8 oscillator, I stop adding positions.

-This trade was 10 entries altogether.

-Once the weekly Oscillator was OS, and I get a 12 H bullish oscillator reversal, I move my stop/TP to the top of that bar.

This move was approx. 8 times the pip profit than the whole move, would I have taken only one entry.

-My way of kkeping loosers small, winners big (the law number one in trading).

I trade 18 charts, mostly Forex, some commodities. Forex on 12 Hour charts, the others on Day charts.

Any time frame below is just too much stop running. Stop running happens even in the 12 hour. (nasty Big Boys ).

Just my 2 cents.

All the best.

I think modified bollinger could help, what do you think?

--- 帖子 #1614 ---
I would forget about Bollinger and just learn how to use (count) the Elliot Wave using the AO, the Alligator and fractals. It's really all you need. Less is more. A guy on YouTube "ItradeAims" has a "how to count the ElliottWave in 10 seconds (free!) 3 part video course. Watch it and thank me later.

Also, a real game changer is the "RangeNoGapBar" (instead of time based bars). It will make your charts SING.

I found it here on another thread.

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-charts?page=8

Good Luck!

I am sorry to all for being so late I have being so much into trying find alternatives and answers through my research about a consistent trading method.

I quite agree with you, I am afraid that signals from chaos 1st edition are not used anymore they have already switched to chaos 2nd edition going counter trend with divergent bars followed by wise men signals and accelerator deceleration oscillator has been eliminated.

So I was discouraged too. Now someone said that chaos 1st edition it works on weekly time frame, should check and see. But I have my serious doubts about the timing usefulness of the Awesome oscillator, it is not that as timing tool since it is always lagging 3 - 4 candlesticks in futures indexes or crude oil contracts! Unless this is an advantage in the way that when you think you are reaching a high or low on your daily time frame then switch to a lower TF say 4 hours and wait for the cross of zero line signalling the beginning of a new wave or crossing its own SMA(5) signal line to exit from your trade or likewise prepare for the new one.

Furthermore I cannot still understand why the midpoint is used? Since the vast majority of the trading community is using the close of the session or time period also there are researches stressing on the importance of the closing price. Most of modern indicators, use EMAs on closing basis for smoothing why this one is using the SMA on midpoint, in his books he mentioned to have checked and tested the AO on mainframe computers he could do the same by checking the 5-34-5 EMA on closing basis which is same as 6-19-6 EMA on close devised by Gerald Appel for his buying signals! Since all these are more timely and give same indication for the wave 4 when it has to dive below or past above the zero line in order to be considered a valid 4th wave, or to see the divergent peak from wave 3 and 5!

I would not say that the Chaos 1st edition is strictly designed for daily TF though! The chaos 1st edition course is on YouTube please watch it is not offered anymore at profitunity.com ,  it is always combined with Elliott waves implying that you switch time frames so the wave you are looking at on your current time frame should have at least 90-120 candlesticks!

Furthermore the question here is to find someone who paid for this course back then in the beginning of 2000 and received some instruction from dr. Bill Williams and to tell us if he is successful at a constant - consistent basis after taking the course and tell us honestly if he is happy and if possible where are we wrong.

Hello ac3w,

I'm back on the scene after many years of inactivity.  I have been reading this kinda old but very informative thread.  I found your indicator set but Im unable to use them because they have expired like 2 years ago.  Will it be possible to repost it with fresh dates?

--- 帖子 #1617 ---
Hi There,

Can you please share the sourcecode of these indicators. We want to try few optimisation.

Hi there,

I have been studying Chaos Trading System by Bill Williams.

Read Trading Chaos 1st and 2nd edition

1t edition is a bit more complex:

-Concepts like MACD 5/34/5 and Elliott Wave are not clear. Seems like introduction of the concept but missing a more extensive explanation about it. Is there any other book to expand on it?

-Fractal is very simple compared with 2nd Edition

-Makes references to a course "profitunity group"

2nd Edition:

-Fractal split in 3 Wise men. Only the 3rd wise man is the same than 1st edition. But the logic is different.

I am missing something or with 2nd edition B.Williams simplifies the whole strategy and the strategy of 1st edition has been desisted (no longer in use).

The profitunity concept, made sense for me but in the 2nd Edition is not mentioned.

With the 3 Wise men, I have problem mixing the 3 WM. Angulation is difficult to measure and 1WM and 3WM I find them opposite to each other. Some how they work better when used separately.

Wondering if there is more tech. books I can read with proper examples or with the chaos book is enough, also happy to discuss about Chaos theory.

Many thanks

Hello, I too am currently mastering Trade Chaos at the moment

What exactly do you not understand about MACD)?

If not to complicate and do unnecessary digging... in a nutshell, what I have heard and learned: Williams just took a simple math from the creator of MACD and applied it to his AO indicator, because it maximally coincided with his research and calculations.

He originally calculated all the readings for waves as in MFI, but it was very labor-intensive for computers of that time, so he took a simpler model for calculations, because it coincided with the original calculations.

As far as I've heard, the method moved towards simplification.

Eventually the three wise men came into being.

(although as they say, everything that was in the books - continues to work)

Angulation / 1st sage is really the most subjective element of all.

As Williams said, this is the moment when you have to break the rules (because it is an entry against the trend), but you have to know how to do it, because before you break the rules, you must first learn to follow the rules)))).

If I'm wrong about something, my elder brothers can correct me =)

__________________________________________

RU:

Здравствуйте, я тоже в данный момент осваиваю Торговый Хаос

Что именно вам непонятно с MACD?)

Если не усложнять и заниматься ненужными копаниями... в двух словах, что я слышал и узнал: Вильямс просто взял простую математическую систему от создателя MACD и применил ее для своего индикатора AO, т.к. она максимально совпадала с его исследованиями, расчётами.

Это же изначально все обстоятельства для волнового вычисления, как и в MFI, но это было очень трудозатратно для компьютеров того времени, поэтому он взял модель для расчётов проще, ведь она совпадала с внешними расчётами.

Сколько слышал, что метод двигался в сторону упрощения.

В конечном итоге появилось 3 мудреца.

(хотя как говорят, всё, что было в книгах - продолжает работать)

Ангуляция / 1й мудрец действительно, самый субъективный элемент из всех.

Как Вильямс, это тот момент когда надо нарушать правила(ведь это вход против тренда), однако это нужно уметь делать, ведь прежде чем нарушать, надо сначала выучить свои правила))))

Если вдруг в чём-то не прав, братья старшие могут поправить =)
