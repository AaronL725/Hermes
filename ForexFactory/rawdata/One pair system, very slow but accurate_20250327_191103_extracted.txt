Hi Satish,

Seems like this is looking for a DLL :

2017.12.20 08:45:21.181 2017.01.02 14:00:00  Forex_KnightRider_1_0 EURUSD,H1: dll calls are not allowed; 'Forex_Knight_Rider.dll'-'CheckForOpenLong'

Thanks,

Mark.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Upon Googling it came up with a commercial product of the same name that also includes a DLL. Maybe check that out if you wish. The chyutias look like a fraud to me though.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
only for euro usd dll not allowed to post . u take dll from my email id

--- 帖子 #7 ---
for other pairs use this EA, and trust it makes only profits but small profits ,  But not tested by me be carefull of this EA only for demo , never use it on real acct

I do not understand well. Do the indicators and EA have expiration? Then will you sell them?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
No expiration , just read manual properly how to use them , it takes time how to implement them by settings those who knows English well no problem ,  yet it takes time to try them first on demo which one suite markets for making profit,  Woodie is good but heavy can not load in my pc , it held up my laptop

My Wave  Chart read as real move of Euro Usd

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Super is Elliot wave system following , it fails very  seldom, but great distance in SL and TP .  But in between waves I allow EA to trade for me . Elliot-wave is my favorite system for trading .  should only trade that pair which give clear analysis of waves if doubt never trade that pair .  EA's are nice for scalping and day tradings whereas ELLIOT-WAVES DEFINE TRENDS VERY NICELY . UP TO 45,50 80 PIPS EA'S ARE BEST ,

Because you can never make and optimize one EA for multiple pair if you do so than result will be poor ,  one EA can be made only for one pair, second reason is programming language , though i do not know anything about computer language , but never seen any multi pair EA last for long run. Iink so his is my own view may be wrong but I th keep seven EA in my expert folder and allow one EA to trade one air,  but I never loose too much in any single trade by EA , it recovers itself .  Still testing many EA which I got from web ,  this is my view may be wrong , My main trade handling weapon is Elliot-wave charts .

--- 帖子 #21 ---
No , no selling ,  it is your time you give to test and try the EA's which one is best for you tell others .

--- 帖子 #22 ---
alternate scenario in Euro Gbp ,  Market trying to break long term trend line , if it breaks than must check or retest .8982,  Audjpy and NZD JPY confirmed long buy

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I must be doing something wrong with the backtest? You are getting profits in live and my back test was no bueno. Any idea's?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
No you are not doing wrong , EA is not placing trades , I am doing it manually for 35-40 pips when you see indication from the chart .  Is the EA placing trade at your end

RSI close EA how it works .

Choose trends automatically, PSAR tech , MA tech , RSI Tech

When trend reverse it takes reverse direction trade. It will keep following trends , but will show loss for the time when market is in pullback mode

It will close trade automatically in reverse of trend , used three RSI , MACD, MA, PSAR (RSI 14,RSI 21 and RSI 11)

For good profit u need to remove SL and TP it will give you profit automatic

--- 帖子 #29 ---
RSI Close EA is my Personal EA, it never alllow to blow out account even if you have 15$ with .01 lot.  Even wave analysis it adopt automatically .  Draw back is you have to watch it when in profit because in pullback mode it will bank out profit and keep you out .   Try and report about it , only in demo , when u feel confident u can use it .

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi
Can you give best setting about RSI EA like time frame, setting etc.?

thankx

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Settings are all already inbuilt in it , you do not change anything just remove sl and tp , even do not increase lot more than .05, it will not enter anytime in the market .

It will chose the best condition and for long run ,  after every four hour u need to check it is in profit or not if in loss do not worry , it is a  profit system , do not ask every thing about it let be some things secret , we have to earn bread and butter here.  Email me I will tell every thing about the system , if I reveal I have to loose this system , just use it and make money .  Thanks hope you can understand the reason of secret.   please do not make any changes if it do not trade u have to Waite we cannot force it to trade.  It enter the market at the right time if late it do not enter

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thanks satish37, but on what timeframe do you use it?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Time frame is already built in , you keep any time frame but it will deal with the market according to its own time frame .  Systems are already there but how to implement and use them is the only Technic.

H4 even u can trade Bitcoin with it, but i not tested bitcoin with it , high volatility is best , small lot big profit ,  again it is slow system , trades less , but loss nearly eliminated

Final trade triggering rule .  For buy trade PSAR should be below the previous candle  in H4 TF , Price is master so should be above 233 SMA of the close in the chart middle one.

Here in this image b is 61.8 % of a and , c is 61.8% of b and d is 61.8%of c and e is 61.8 % of d which is 1.3363 so  market should not come or cross 1.3362-52

this is what i have learned in theory and seen by many expert comments .  any how after break from these point market will move in five waves up or down toal lenth of this contracting triangle is the target of market in either direction which ever it breaks , for safe entry first let the market break this trianlge and than enter the trade ,

waite and be patience it will give good profit

SL should be below the previous buy candle here yellow arrow , Applicable for all currencies pairs with TF H4 and Daily time frame

Let us see what time is coming ahead as per our own currency meter .

1.  This currency meter is not any instrument but our mind how we will decide it is as follows ;-

(i)   we know eurochf is trading at the top of is wave 3 so fourth wave is down pending.

(ii)  we know euro usd is also trading at its top and ready for long correction which is situated below 1.1400.

(iii)  we know euro gbp has long down target at .8328 means it has completed all conditions for corrections now mature for big down move .

(iv)   we know that eurojpy is trading at overbought conditions ,much over bought where as it is pending to take correction to 1.2845.

(v)  we also know that gbp jpy has long target situated at 164.00

So from above conclusion, we expeinst  news and move against oing to be weak sooner or later Euro ,

where as any source should favour gbp

so over all conclusion is Usd to get strength sooner or later

Gbp should trade with medium strength no weak no too much strength

Euro going to be much much weak sooner or later against its rivals

So Usd gong to be the No 1 power

gbp the second power

CHOOSING A TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION OF 8 WAVE CYCLES:-

1. Short term Intraday setup on a 15 minute chart------  1 Day to 3 weeks.

2. Medium term swing setupon an hourly chart  --------   1 to 5  months.

3. Long term position setup on a Daily chart -------  - --   3 months to 1 Year.

Now you can decide how to be patience for a trade to look for real wether is is against you or in favour of you , sometimes we exit the trade which is in favour of us ,
and sometimes we stick with the trade which is against us .

Most of the time about 90% of the time when we blow our account or go in big loss are only when we fall against wave 3 or 3 of 3 or 5 or 3 of 5

100% of your Broker are Hunting for your Stop Loss.
They Know how much money you have in your account , They want to take it .

Prevention: - Trade with minimum lot for big pips  ( example 150 account balance lot 0.01 target 150-200 pips ) need  to accept loss happily as part of this business.

Forex is return of your investment with great care.  If not so market would have traveled in straight line, it would never have adopted zigzag motion.

Never trade many pairs with single broker.  Need to have five or more Brokers account .

Needs only right entry and right exit .

First point to look for trend direction on daily and weekly
Look for Price Action

Your entry must be supported by RSI and MACD

on current TF

This is possible with EA only

If Euro Usd is unwilling to touch 1.1971 than expect bounce from here , no more  further upside.

But if 1.1971 is touch we can expect further upside atleast to 1.2000 level

Stop level can be put at 1.1971

Sorry satish37 but I don't understand. Do you start and stop the EA's according the fibo levels or do you let the EA's run all the time?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Yes I stop it at fibo level, start both at the same time same TF in separate charts , for 1 pair two charts same TF, in one install buy in second install sell, allot only 6-10$

In the last phase of the move , volume start decreasing ,

What makes you certain to have an A-B wave?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Count 5 waves move in which wave 4 should not touch wave 1-2 boundry

after five move.  is A wave having 5 waves at its degree, than wave B should have 3 waves, after that is strong wave C having 5 waves none stoppable at all degree

apply fibo to its length for accurate measurement, do you need material I will post , there rules which cannot be broken , there are guidelines to follow .

that is the wave theory

As Said Earlier , A=B condition met in EuroUsd,

Now only we want to see price to touch 1.1995, to finish upward momentum, and set a target for minimum 600 pips down for sell trade. or much below

I am not uploading fresh charts, as it needs great hard work to prepare and finish one chart, accurately,

I am glad to inform you that all the above uploaded charts are accurate and trading according to their waves.

Reason for not uploading fresh chart is not only hard work but also my internal fear if it will go against I becoes very tense where i made mistake.

Second reason before making a chart I need to now its alterpoint so if it is against me how to make it alter for a profitable trade.

So final for euro used is short trade ends point at 1.2097.

and end point for buy trade is at 1.1994.

I trading in real account and only will post the trades which i have executed.

I am hiding stop loss so not posting stop loss, as broker are hunters for in search of Stop loss

Just now I reviewed the chart for EuroUsd:

If EuroUsd crossed 1.2093 than read the wave count as Red 5 is Red 3 and Red A is wave 4.

So the target for the Red 5 lies at 1.2143 Market should reverse from this zone for the five waves down,

For those who are not successful traders I have great meterial collect from 2012 to 2017 , It took e continuous 5 year of hard work to be a non looser trader, yes it is true , to loose are finished but to be profitable required some investment and gr8 patience , but money will not be a proble in your life.

The condition is you have to learn and study with faith , Once you learn you will thanks yourself for this hardwork and enjoy yourlife,  as said earlier learn market technic how it behaves,

In the next post I will tell you the real truth why most of the people loose and how to avoid it completely

Today I have found one more setup in Usd/Pln (US $ and Poland Zloty).

It has travelled too much means it is very very much oversold condition.

Second it is in the last stage of wave 5 nearly complete ,but completion fibo target is at 3.3962, but I have entered some advance because if market do not touch that point I will miss the good opportunity for the right entry , I have accepted to see the loss of 20-35$ before I see profit ,

Because target is to gain 50 % of my equity of small account of $130,  if it hit my target I will gain $50 with lot 0.01 account equity 130$.

Next point is do not miss EuroUsd if you get entry at 1,2143-1,2160  , but market may not go there that is why we need to accept some loss to see to get the right entry at the right point ,

XauUsd:-  I might have posted the chart image of this pair but I did not find it so posting it again;

What to look for in this chart is , break of 1364.00 break will give very nice opportunity for long trades but wav e counts recommend down side break so if it break the high of Wave A in weekly charts as shown in image it is a great opportunity for buyer, it is near the break of diagonal formation in weekly charts,

here note that down side break recommended by weekly chart and monthly chart.  But main thing is to enter after the break of point A high or after rejection of point a high .  entering option is as for buy trades make stop loss below 1355, and for sell trade put stop loss 1366

Though there is opportunity in XauUsd but will be very boring and fed up, as in the weekly chart is has to make three waves ,

it may go down to 1300.00 to 1308.00 than again go to  1351.00 (Which should be the last point of resistance ) and than finally down to 763.80 , but 1364.00 is very crucial point of resistance if it is broken than expect minimum up target at 1500.00 and above. But I dont think the decisive point will be seen in the end of next week also over all I look 1351.00 to 1363.00 the last and hard resistance f or the advancement of gold ,

wave E is not yet created it is under the process for creation , for a good and safe trading we should take decision after rejection of break of the exact point E.

Are you willing to sell Gbp Usd ?

Than follow this formula :

Sell @ 1.3992 or 1.4121 for 200 pips target but dont sell below 1.3900

Not giving Stop loss as this is in the last stage of wave 5 tend is likely to terminate very soon may be by Wednesday or Tuesday next week.

it is going to complete five waves move upside exact range is 1.4067 some what +- is always there

Than is will take three moves down at the larger degree

See the image below it seems wave 4 red has started Target for wave 4 shown in image but not for wave five

wave five will go slightly 150+- pips above wave 3 of Red

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Have you noticed market reversed from this trend line shown in Image if 150.00 is broken than matter is really serious .

Because something underground is taking place in Gbp and Jpy currencies ,

You go and watch Usd Jpy in weekly mode and place trend ine there it is also on the brick of certain valuable decision, so next week wednesday something important will be seen in many pair .

If anyone who catches those moment of entering the trades in right time will Earn good amount of money with law risk

Now you have done every thing fine start download click start button, while downloading if it does not start change name of file downloading file anyting like figure or letter or mixed that is all

--- 帖子 #131 ---
First point is to identify swing or say waves , Waves are in the form of Cycle degree , Primary degree, Intermediate Degree, Minor Degree, Minute Degree, Minuette Degree and sub minute Degree.

As I have stated Time period above in previous posts, You need to analysis at least four Degree, , then placing the trade at lowest Degree will 98% time successful trade , just you need to waite for the right time and have patience, but it is nearly guaranteed that you will never loose money from your account.

The most difficult phase is aligning four degree, you start from Intermediate Degree to Minuette Degree ,

Intermediate is weekly and Minuette is Hourly that is all , it took me six years for mastering analysising and still learning, but as i said above leave the pari which you can not analysis or are not sure of counting properly , search for another pair you will find

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Yes there is software also to analysis waves  , i have posted it above, motive waves  you need to crack it , posted crack gtorrent file check in the above posts

Yesterday on Monday I left every thing , thinking the forex is not for me, I have all Six years of hard work no use proved to be useless, just thinking what and where

i am making mistake, and slept but when wakeup at 1400 PM IST Every thing was fine ,

Just thank creator (God) for the hard work,  and my analysis work

I dont know which factor is working when something goes against really I get worried ,

I will say Market is our best friend , but when it is angry never touch it

It realizes each and every thing , Once I asked the market why are you so cruel ?

She answered no dont blame me I a not cruel but giving money to people , it is their mind attitude and impatience which makes them losses other wise

every indicator even the simplest moving average also works ,

Main thing is always stick to your Plan and your indicators and trust them , stick with them never implement every thing in your trading plan just read and forget ,

It's a combination of 96LWMA, CCI Custom candles, Morning Flat Indicator, 3 tier London Breakout, Fibonacci Pivots and Market Sentiment with Trend Strength indicators.

It gives multiple targets in the direction of the market and Sentiment.

It's not a London or Asia session breakout system.

You have to fit the Morning Flat indicator to close at FO in synch with your Broker's platform time maybe even the 3 tier London breakout indicator and the vertical time lines.

Is there any option to delete some posts ? And how much time it take to be deleted?

Please reply anyone who knows , Trend reversed in Euro/Usd and Gbp/Usd , Amendment in Gold , Gold reversed back and broke  back below 1352.00 the reversal is sudden hence consider the monthly wave is taking place , if this view is right 1357.00 should hold and make very strong resistance , and below side it should hit 1300. handle or some what more than again attempt to come up , as said earlier in the chart limited upside potential

Hello Satish Ji,

I have a small problem, please help me.

I have installed the EA Forex KnightRider_1_0.exe but it is not placing any trade. The screen shot with settings used is enclosed herewith.

I went back to your post 25 where you suggested to use a crack that I downloaded but could not understand how to use it.

That screenshot is also enclosed for your ready reference.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yes kkb2k8 ,
First Forex knight Rider places very few trades , here also I see very few trades it placces .

Second about motive waves you need soo see few java is downloaded on your pc or not , make internet explorere your default browser and down load java.

than second step you install motive waves version 4.2.24
after install dont start motive wave , or restart your pc , first copy the cracked jar files to their default directory:
i.e. programme file >motive wave > lib   ( here copy and paste the two cracked .jar files)
restart your pc , now you need to have demo account with the list of brooker it has for example is have fxcm , login id is like  D29991354 it start with letter D,

install it again after, first clean up already installed

five up waves are complete in GBPUSD and EUROUSD also in GBPUSD Market has entered again in the channel as is has crossed up sided fro the channel now images in below posts

All the tools and information are collected from the web and recd as gift in some webinars, so here nothing is my private strategy , it is already on the internet.

Psychological factor which I learned is , Good --- Better----  Best .

If you don't take risk you cant earn,  The fair is mathematical calculation 2% or 4% or even up to 20% yearly upon your investment . It is very easy with the start of $10, 000 , maximum lot size is 0.02 with this amount , and close of the Trade is $200 loss i.e. @2%.  In this strategy , total lot should not go beyond 0.1,
Rule should not be broken , You also do not have to watch the Market .  But still one good entry strategy is needed.

Practically very few Traders , Trades with this strategy , Myself also not in this category, because this require good amount, I have plan to enter this type of Trading in separate account, because in the course of time I have become, a computer sticky worm .

Only winning is Trading

Start with $50 only no more see the calculation below:

5x10 = 50 means 10 trades

alloted $5 for each trade as SL

Ratio 1:2 means for 10$ risk 5$

expected win 10 , 10x10= 100

expected loss 4/5 i.e. 20 or 25 or 6x10=60 or 8x10 =80

80-50=30$

or

60-50=10$

net profit 10$ or 30$ not bad

we stick to this law for three months , than one month profit 120, 3 months 3x120= 360

for the next three months we increase lot to .02 , after six months , we get 720$

keep the strategy for 1 year . $1420 easily can be earned trading forex

One Important level to be noted in AUDCAD 1.0148 very important watch it market should not pass this point if passed 20 pips above 1.0148 . than long buy

if reflected than a great long sell,

If calculation are correct than EuroUsd reserved for 200 pips down unless something bad news for USD, but what I see is any news will push lower EuroUsd.

80 pips already down expect 120- to 130 easily

Gold will take time .

Only one hope in Nzd Jpy near , GbpJpy will also take some time nay be two days for long down signal, rest setup will tell what is going to happen

Today is Wednesday in India, So Thursday and Friday are left for thinking , how long will we go thinking , no it is time to take action with the moves , entering advance in moves makes money , because no one wants retail traders to make money from this market .  So sell  gbpusd @1.4221 or 1.4250 is good opportunity and targeting 1.3890 is not a bad task  , but not blame me for your losses , only my thoughts and trading ideas are typed here, risking 50 pips for 400-500 pips is not a bad idea

UsdChf  : Buy

EuroUsd: Sell

GbpUsd; Sell

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Scanning with three systems is compulsory, to be in profit or exit before loss.  I will write about it later in details .

One thing I want to say is Market goes too much in the direction of the trends.  If you are in Gbp Jpy trade you must exit at 156.63 from the sell mode..

It is good buy above that point but today is also Gbp News. Not silly question , it is good question we must ask what ever is in our mind. Thanks

--- 帖子 #200 ---
If this SL point survives any how , than the reward will be great potential to hit back to 137.00 to 139.00 but market is quite near to it may be broken or may not be just two pips were left .above that point you can place buy

Strongly sell Gbp Usd : from 1.4162 -1.4110 TP 1.4048 SL 1.4200

EuroUsd : Sell 1.2485 -1.2462 TP 1.2392 SL 1.2503

Have a look at Nzd Jpy and EuroGbp signals

All the Signals are in tune and harmonic with the trend

Bitcoin buy limit @5869.00  Tp  17041.00 SL $10 only for 0,01 lot

Now you can calculate (Strongly Recommended) if this $10 loss is hit exit bitcoin trade than it has great risk to go much more down ,

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I'm sorry. I don't understand the bitcoin trade. price is now around 8065.  It closed half gap this morning and is now going down?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Very simple Bitcoin Limit buy order @5859.00  and TP 17041.00  trade with lot 0.01 only and exit trade if loss is $10 . Because if it goes below  that level risk is that it may go unexpected down level. but if it start rising it can rise to that level and even much more , the level are crucial.

This month you have gr8 opportunity to earn . It is better to trade manually and exit manually , because manually we can control and decide our decisions,  it is not so easy to get profit , market will go down but before thaetting momentum t it can give spike up to takeout your SL and than huge jump down ,  you were right but out from the trade . a good opportunity will be gone .

Example now Silver is rising but in true sense it is not rising it is planned to jump down with pressure getting momentum for down move, same is with gold how many up and down it has made target is down but it is market it will not allow with small amount to take huge profit

--- 帖子 #212 ---

Lock your profit in UsdChf and Euro Usd

Traders fail to realize that locking in profits does not mean you are closing out the entire position, but a portion of it.  A trader making money and then losing it in the same breath, breeds uncertainty, which leads to overtrading, constant changing of ones system, and ultimately losses.  Locking in the profits builds the money management techniques which lead to a successful trading business.

Today GbpUsd and EuroUsd confirmed sell, in the real sense sell starts from this level, now buy should be avoided totally .

Wait for todays candle close and tomarrow open, for swing traders tomarrow is the time to decide market direction and than hold position for at least a week

Alert Alert Alert : Bitcoin levels are :

1 .  5554.00
2.   3155.00
3.   1914.00
if Market breaks one it will hit second if it breaks second it will hit third . So unless there is bounce of two candles do not enter

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Bounce on daily candles?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
yes Daily candles at least two candles

How do you get

using Forex Infinity? EU(H4) is still above SMA(70)

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Watch the video posted above , it was all grace or bonus move upside , clear beautiful pin bar , watch the price action of multiples candles , they are clearly denying up move , pin bar is at the end of a long swing , market is much over bought , this swing is exactly 161.8 % of previous swing and 238% of last up swing .

There was not even a 0.001% point in favor of further up move .   Lastly it was end of wave 5 you can measure it in all possible relation of theory .

In fact this was the last breath of GbpUsd and EuroUsd to up side. If any how some bad news comes today or in a week than too 1.2522 is last point or 1.2545.

Now both pairs should go for 700 to 1000. though $index touching 92.40 will be confirmation for the end of up trend .  That is why I join three method for my confirmation.  That is why Price Action are must for trader . I know when I say sell no one will say sell , I reserve 100 pips at that level for market to breath. Lastly EuroUsd has gone 300 pips more than it should not go to that level, but no rule in market market itself is rule.

A risk can make you reach decide yourself , no suggestion from me

Thanks Satish for the calls yesterday. I have yet to add the points up but they were positive. It is a little tricky stepping in and out of trades to bag your profits but this can be learned.

Also, Bitcoin was a bit too 'wild west' for me so I just stood aside. I almost certainly ended up better off by not playing.

Thanks again for all your good advice.

--- 帖子 #229 ---

EuroJpy : Sell@ Market Price TP 133.96 SL @ 137.41

But Possible Target is 130.86 ( target I)

Possible target II 127.58 ( I will like to see this Target)

There is strong competition between Euro-USD-Gbp- and Jpy

Euro has lost steam Gbp is suffering weakness diseases

Euro is also due for correction .

Usd and Jpy has suffered now it is time for them to recover in good health or if not in good health at least deep correction is pending for both the pairs

All the three TPs are likely to be hit, but patience to hold the trade is required it will give one unsuccessful bounce to the upside than will cool down for long move to down side

I think big moves decision will be settled today because we are just below 100 pips to see that decision point hope by the UK session levels will tell will direction we have to enter our trades for a long term for better earning some money

GbpUsd: Pending Sell Limit @ 1.4005- 1.4021 TP 1.3805 SL 1.4082ely

Gbp Usd Trade not activated and market reversed hence cancell it immediate no use now entring
It is better to close it now than going in loss

Silver (XagUsd) pending sell limit @ 16.82 TP 15.71 SL 17.01 (should be now non stop)

Euro Jpy : Shift SL to 134.71

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Get wrong reading in eurjpy correction. Only take +40pips. Its going down quickly now. Must wait for another correction to reentry at 135.00

--- 帖子 #234 ---
yes it is facing strong  support 134.71 may not break today but TPs will be hit

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Stay tuned best signals will be there . Just one entry will make good money

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Dear Satish,

I love your fish but I try to build my fishing rod

I viewed and reviewed and rereviewed the video you recomend. But I absolutely can not get an idea how the author select the previous period. So I understand his SR levels points selection. But in which period does he search for them?

May I ask you to show on 1 ore several screenshots how (and WHERE) right you look for big boys levels?

Anyway I thank you for your time and attention to us!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Just an example: XAGUSD. You propose to sell at "down arrow" and TP at "check mark" levels. But why do you ignore 2 support levels marked by "?" ?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you!

Check The Strongest Price Action in Silver USD:

1. Two Bar in the circle they say of strong down momentum power to break all possible support.

2. You See strong long bear candle to the down side that too on the 233 SMS of the close (233 SMA of close high and low are shown in the chart.)

3. RSI 21 was supporting me to downside.

To trigger a trade only three price action points are sufficient for me.

If we have a candle with higher wick having two candle to its left and two candles to its right side, that is best setup , Insert 5 SMA of High and 5 SMA of low execute at the close below 5 SMA of the low and stop level as shown in image 3

5 SMA of the high and 5 SMA of the low are very important for deciding SL and Trade execution as it set small loss big profit ratios .

--- 帖子 #239 ---
yes I will prepare screen shot of how to look for strong support and resistance look for that, now since yesterday waiting for strong setup will post that later.

Todays candle close is very important to decide further market movement.

Sell AudJpy @ Market Price 85.45 TP 81.84 SL 85.82 SL hit at 85.82 , should exit
(This trade should be entered with low volume as is has two SL main SL is located at 86.82)
If you are trading it for good profit than make your SL 85.72. If this is hit we will enter again
but the trade is very good that it might not hit 85.72,
the other two factor shows me 85.82 and 86.82 levels but Trade is so good that below 85.30 it is super fast for down move
EuroJpy : yesterday was sell Today is strong sell

EuroGbp: pending sell limit @ .8832 TP 8732 SL .8915 (target is much more this tp is for running week only)

(Do not enter advance before touching .8832 excluding spread)

lock profit high impact news ahead 15 minutes from now

EuroUsd: Pending sell limit @ 1.2283-1.2293 TP 1.2219 SL 1.2332 (Normal Trade) It is based on down target of uncomplete
target of wave c . so it is 50%-50% trade recommended for those who takes risk easily.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Do we re enter at 85.82?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
No use now entering because once SL has been hit if it goes down than I have no count about is if it goes up than to I have no count about it . Level was mush important . Let me watch it today and let me see its close why and how this happened. At present I have no clue , I count it as lost trade

To cover up loss of this Trade if you are not in Euro Jpy than you can enetr EuroJpy @135.08 SL 135.42 and take profit in between 134.00 -134-30, but if you are already in it avoid as it is a long run trade , for long run trade 100-150 pips are ignored as that setup is on daily TF. I just calculated it on H1.

Trades are always best at the entry point only , however jump in between is not good habit.

Just checked EuroJpy You avoid it entering market again down too much

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Alert Close Euro Usd in profit do not wait for TP

Though there is possibility for 45 pips more as per three bar inside bar , but it is also end of 5th wave at small degree could be 150 pips bounce . I do not suggest to take risk

GbpUsd: Buy limit @ 1.3795 - 1.3821 TP 1.3992 SL 1.3728 (Trade not activated) cancell pending order

Euro Usd : buy only if it touched 1.2315 this point confirm buy

Euro Jpy can rise to 135.08 at this point sell with more power
.at any moment eurojpy can start its down move with with strong force as it has to go a long distance
so who are already in trade hold it , rest who want to join should join only in between 134.92 - 135.05

new trade setup: euro usd sell @market price 1.2289 TP 1.2219 SL 1.2315

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Miss the eurusd sell setup

Holding audjpy right now move the SL to 84.90 still waiting TP at 82.xx

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hey Satish, I thought id give your rsi close EA a bash and on a a couple of pairs ive attached it to its taken a trade ad immediately closed it and it keeps on doing the same things until ive shut off the EA (would take 100trades if I allowed it in a matter of minutes) Am I doing something wrong? All setting have remained the same, ive just removed sl & tp as advised. Thankyou

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Do you use it for TP? Or TP is at SR only?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Please, check me at GU:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

We can sell it now after two PA with long wicks and one engulfing till the nearest TP 1.36114. Not very important that it's still above MA233 (if we are ready to "take risks easily").

Is this analysis right?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Close AUDJPY +60 pips cover previous SL lose. Nice signal satish

--- 帖子 #249 ---
It is good message for me, great

--- 帖子 #250 ---
yes good but see the images below :

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yes use it for SL strongly recommended,  TP is decided as per fibo levels on which wave market is trading .

It is easy to trade impulsive waves , but corrective wave require some readings and their fibo ratios to be remembered, also initial structure high and low should be in mind so that we escape from false moves. Will post image later

--- 帖子 #252 ---
EuroJpy Market should not touch 133.98 if that is touched than there is much miore move to the upside , and we should close sell and open new buy with double lot .

Now Our legal SL for sell  is shifted to 133.98 TPs are the same as long as this point is not touched

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Short AUDJPY again @84.82 target 50pips or more will trail

--- 帖子 #254 ---
As long as 1.2315 Holds means till it is not touched look for down movement till 2011 iis not touched minimum level for completion for up move

GbpUsd :  Expect one more bounce to the upside . near to 1.4005 or near by , than sell with strong force

--- 帖子 #255 ---
You please re-upload  the EA that you are using , I will see if you are using the right one or not and than give you setting.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
yes correct that one need to be repaired or remove from you Pc that will make great losses .  new RSI EA have been up-loaded you can use them

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Euro Gbp : This break out is very very important Sell or Buy at the break out and keep SL just 20 Pips and TP down side .8404
if the break out is upside than .9233. As it is aligned with other pairs like Euro Usd and GbbJpy

If you will enter at the proper level you will not loss, and should hold as long as level holds

Look previous posts NzdJpy near to that decision points

Aud Jpy : you can sell with more confidence with break of today's low means below .8430 it should become targeted to 81.79 SL .8605

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Close Sell in EuroJpy and Open Buy TP 135.75 SL 133.39
Very nice trade with good confirmation

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I'm in but there is trendline resistance around 134.09. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
EJPY....Perhaps this next push up will get it through and upwards.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Now to the structure which is formed resistance does not matter. Strong resistance already broken 133.90 134.00

check H4 TH and put 5 SMA , HIGH AND LOW MARKET IS ABOVE

--- 帖子 #262 ---
It is education. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
YES structure does not care for news even , I have seen it many times strong news fail but structure of the market does not fail only can be human error calculating right structure that is why all the student of the course does not earn equal whatever our eyes see correct or wrong , but after some movement of market it is quite easy to find error done by individual .

for example in eurojpy i was looking for impulsive move down side , than when i saw wave 3 of 3 started but failed , also today i saw it taking the shape of triangle ,

Big Boys are not always and every time in the market , they come do their work means take away all the money from the market and gone . When they come market becomes volatile even we dont know when they come and in which pair

GbpUsd see channel :

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Why do we need leg C at this fibo level?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
EJPY very strong resistance line. If it breaks through, it may shoot higher?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
No it is start of Triangle B , it is just starting it must go minimum to 61.8% of the high to low of Eurojpy, these wave are of consolidations type takes maximum time,

only impulsive move is fast and strong which takes 20% of the total time , 80% time is consumed by corrective type ,

--- 帖子 #267 ---
when a top is formed market change direction, in that change of direction , market makes small degree waves , a, b ,c in fact it is always three waves at the large cycle degree for convenience we divide them further , if we allot a correct channel to these waves , we can estimate when market is bouncing if it breaks channel than either it should enter again in the channel after one or two candle if not it is advancing with force . theory point of view market is made of 5-3 waves

after every five waves there should be correction of three waves .  First read theory than make practice , that will make you perfect , but market is not bound in any rule , it is game of probality , that is why we loose and win , only win is not possible for any one , but the best method is take small loss at the correct level ,

example i am holding eurojpy

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I made a blunder mistake , for the continuous second time My account have been blown out I was placing 0.1 lot and by mistake I placed 1.0 lot .

I was waiting for GbpUsd to complete five waves at small degree now as it just complete and was ready to bounce for 200 pips but bad luck for me

expect now Gbp usd to bounce to 1.4029 minimum TP allot 100 pips for market to breath

Ok bye now few days I will stop trading and lock down my PC complete rest for me for 15 days ,

thanks and regards , best of luck happy and nice trading for all of you

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi Satish. I am sorry to read about your blunder. Everyone who trades has done that. I am also sorry you blew your account.

It is wise to take a break.

I look forward to your return and new posts but for now, forget about trading.

Best wishes, ST.

Hi friend ,

Today Sunday

I am busy analyzing market and optimizing EA, It has to be a fresh week dont know what will be outcome

Some very very great setup has been seen , so this week should be a great earning without doubt , though some of the old trades has been confirmed for their move ,

example gold is confirmed to down for big move, as already posted in previous post unimaginable move to down side is going to happen the 1374.00 point is still safe so as long as this level hold we cannot expect up move below 1377.00 .

EuroUsd : as seen in the chart 1.2667 should hold or it may be possible that the down move for 1000 pips has started . But buying in EuroUsd is a foolish task

My recommendation on this pair is to hold short for 1000 pips at-least to 1.1645

Now UsdJpy and UsdChf are at the terminating point , when the termination of a trend happens , positions has to be hold for 300 pips because trend is changing for big move we have to do this , so has to be managed money for trades only for big moves

I am calculating level , it will take time so I will post six hours later after calculating it needs some time to calculate

USDJPY: Entry in Between 104.32 to 105.54 For 110.15 (+- 50 pips)

USDCHF : Levels 0.9021 and 0.8676 (For returning and trend change)
0.9218 FOR PULL BACK 0.9497
(NEVER TRADE SHORT IN USDJPY AND USDCHF UNTIL THEY COMPLETE THEIR PULL BACK TO 110 AND 0.9450 LEVELS)
$iNDEX: NO WAY TO STOP $iNDEX BELOW 0.9286, IT MUST REACH THIS LEVEL AT ANY CONDITION

EUROTRY: TP @4.2985 AND 4.0195 TOP FORM AND CONFIMED AT THE PREVIOUS HIGH SO YOU KNOW SL WILL BE PREVIOUS HIGH

NZDJPY : A PICTURE IS BETTER THAN 10000 WORDS, THIS SINGLE TRADE CAN MAKE YOU REACH YOU YOU CAN TRADE IT AND UNDERSTAND IT , OK LET ME TELL YOU AFTER THIS BREAK OUT MARKET WILL MOVE IN FIVE WAYS TOWARD THE DIRECTION IT BREAKS EXPECT MINIMUM 600 PIPS FROM THIS TRADE WHAT EVER BE YOUR LOT, IT IS TRYING SINCE LAST SEVEN DAYS TO BREAK THIS POINT SEE THE PROOF

GBPUSD : BUY 1.4036 , SL 1.3922 TP 1.4231-1.4354-1.4409

GBPUSD : SELL 1.4036, SL 1.4073, 1.4104, 1.4146 TP 1.3441

iF DOWN SIDE 1.3922 IS TOUCHED NO WAY TO STOP IT , IF UPSIDE 1.4146 IS CROSSED WE CAN EXPECT MORE UPSIDE

BUT HERE NOTABLE POINTS ARE IN EUROGBP GBP IS REACHING A POINT OF SHOWING SOMETHING BEING STRONGER, YET POINT IS NOT CROSSED IN EUROGBP IT MAY TAKE THE COMING WEEK IF THERE IS NO GOOD NEWS EXPECT CONSOLIDATIONS OR WEAK MOVEMENT IN EUROGBP , AGAIN THE LEVELS ARE IMPORTANT AS I TOLD IN EURO USD ALSO IF YOU HAVE READ THE PREVIOUS POSTS, (ABOUT ITS UP MOVE THAT LEVEL MUST BE TOUCHED)

AudJpy: Great Opportunity if some news is there from Jpy or Aud Image below

EuroAud: Strong Sell @ market price SL 1.5816 TP @ 1.5483 (close half) 1.5160 (close full)

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Satish.

Good to see you back.

If there are good trades this week, let's take them. If no good trades, then that's ok.

I hope you feel refreshed from your break.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
yes it was good and nice rest , but missed some good opportunity , what could be better in this year than selling eurousd at 1.2551 for 1.1645 (TP)

Gold too could sold at 1359.00 for below 900.00

--- 帖子 #273 ---
eurusd now around 1.24092. Still time to sell on pull-back?

and gold is still up at 1346.9. Still many pips to run?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
yes correct my entry will be on monday evening at us open

--- 帖子 #275 ---
hi friend ,

don't hope for any pull back in eurousd , not possible now . Once done so done , if you get than all those points are plus point means to damage buyers at the pull back . Here market dont stay for long even if it takes positions of triangle . As i know even monday will not matter for such points

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi my friends and fellow traders,

Today i have read some post in this form , so instead of posting more signals I have decided to give you people a Technic, which makes nearly 40-60 pips on daily basis.

So this page will be somewhat long as i will make some charts and post them you down load them i will delete them to make page shorter.

This system will definitely make you rich , if you trade only this pattern no other, read it again and again , for any doubt ask me , very few traders know about it how it works : see images below first hree for buy trades next three for sell trades, the system is so strong can recover your 10,000$

I have give task to programmer to make EA on the strategy , I will share the system here on this form

Dear Satish

What to do on Njpy? should we buy or sell? or wtfor trendline to break?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
decision pending till break happen

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Never loss 1000 for 40 or 50 but loss 40 or 50 for 1000

I have decided to take AudJpy : buy tomorrow with sl @81.75, TP @94.60 reason risking 275 pips for a gain of 1000.40 pips is not a bad task

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Friends ,

After getting too many burns from the market, what I learned from my experience is , Why the burns happens what were those reason.

1.  We cannot make 10 to 10000. we can get 100 from 10000 as return on investment regular basis.  So it is business.

2.  Always divide your account balance and equity into number of trades you can execute , keeping in mind loss first , not think of reward first.

3.  Never Think of 10 ,20, or 30 easy pips and taking big lots that is 100% gambling and 90% reason of blowing out account.

4.  Those who says of converting 10000 into 15000 or 20000 in a month , never listen them , they might have done but that is by chance not the way of trading.

5.  You can survive with $15 with proper management. but not with 10000 without management.

6.  Don;t care for market movement but take care of money management.

8. It is only 20% time when a currency is in force with the trend , than it has to retrace .

9.  Keep in mind big cycles are always repetitive, so never be afraid of market just think of your fixed deposit with minimum return.

10. Analyze market on Sunday and execute on Monday and close on Friday if on small loss or profit , after 3 weeks major pairs will return 60% to 70%  , except the cases from where market has not picked up from bottom or top example EuroUsd picked up from bottom so there are less chances to return 70% but 40% , 50%, or even 60 is must .

Now you can think how the market behaves.  Your broker want you to places maximum trades for that they will give you some bonus , and some few thousand to participate in competition to make 10000 to 20000. Nor it is they way of market nor it is trading ,

Last and final Market dont want your money only your broker want your money , market is designed by Govt in a very efficient way very well properly managed.

But all external radicals are manipulating , individual traders, our money is their enjoyment,

There is only one and only one and one word for forex success that is  Proper Money management  .

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Nice article. Have you taken trade in USD sht, Aj buy etc as previously you explained. If so what trade you advise at this moment?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
It depends upto what time you want profit , if you wan good and safe entry want to see direct profit and you dont want to see even few pips starting loss than you need to enter eurousd(sell) when $index closes above 20 SMA on daily time frame . If you want long term than AudJpy need to closes above previous pin bar candle . If you want just 50 -60 pips than hold till london session let us see movement in Gbp usd . At this time this movement entry is not good you are 100 pips already late . for 20-30 pips you can buy usdchf,

If you want good money AudNzd for buy but not today entry as it has target at 1.1250 so wait to make good money market will shoot up need some news force  i dont see any news coming , news move the market but in favor of cycles not against cycles , if good news is against cycles news will fail not cycles

Be careful in euro usd 200 SMA and 61.8% fibo in H1 time frame market is trading at this moment , profit traders should exit and enter again sell mode after crossing 200 SMA and 8 SMA should also have crossed 200 SMA this is to protect your profit though there will be loss of some pips entering and exiting the market

Hi and thanks again!

Is this pattern tested on real for some time?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
yes friend what else I am doing here , placing trades according to it , it originator sold it at a very high rate I not remember his name he is from uk, 20 yrs experienced

in market. its stop loss is just three pips above previous high or low and profit target is full one swing nearly for week or two week you have to last that trade .

Important part is it is 95% accurate. but all you need to have is to memorize it.

You google on net its name is pip reversal system you can find video about it , you have to search

Hallo, Satish

Which good entry for AUD/NZD in your opinion? Also think it will grow.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
yes brother here , I may prove to be wrong , but note that TP > and My Sl but I am still far away from SL and My entry was at it has come back from and I know the situation where is genuine SL. Though it is possible to be hitted but seldom i get SL not always nor always I get in market except certain points

One more thing note that It will rise with burst or if it will fail i will reverse my trade in the reverse but note above . I trade with lso I have to wait for SL hit till than I have to hold , and if I cant risk 100 pips for pips than what is meaning of trading

One more thing executing a trade very sub tile art , How I prepared this chart resembled entry  @ but after noting the movements of market i came to know this point is SL for the trade and it is the point where everything changes than on Monday I have decided to take 6 trades of which 2 are pending 1 not confirmed one eurogbp got SL hitted during news time and two still running , third usd jpy I will take for 50 pips gain only

I did not understand what you say, but my message for you is in Forex after completing the proper course you will need a personal coach who can tell  you how to jump in this market and where to jump and than how to be out from the market,  unless than there is no hope.  First you have to study after that every theory concept is clear , you will be taken into this market in live training by coach in hand to hand so that you become perfect than you will understand many thing about the market. I can give you training without money but my discipline is very strict in this market, so i am not fit as a teacher in Forex, I can tell you the name of a person but he is from USA, to get training from him is not so  easy , but if you are lucky may be

Please note that Eurousd and gbp sud will return to the minimum same point from where they rose, it can take time but they must come

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Satish, what you think of CHFJPY? and AUDNZD(still in)?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
cfhjpy need to touch 114.53 than no doubt that it will reach 116.33

Audjpy seems like taking time but this time it will rise with force . Aud is not getting supporting data

--- 帖子 #323 ---
What was your emtry point in aud nzd?

It would be better if you leave chfjpy , but 116.33 it will go , it has countering time frame as per H1 it should go to 116.33, but on bigger picture it could bestart on down trend , I made mistake taking buy in this pair

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I have much entries. Various prices. Think will big move. Still in chfJpy.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Let me tell you do not touch audnzd below 1.1290 that is only first stage minimum target will be above 1.2150 but there will be many up down this lowesr point will not come again in this year

If you really want to earn money it is not difficult , allow trades to run and let them take time to hit target, patience is needed

Hello Satish37,

Thanks for sharing your forex knowledge.

Could you please let me know your view points on EURGBP and Cryptocurrencies ?

Regards,

Mavilakandy

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Have you not seen previous post about EuroGbp, unless it breaks trend line, its picture is not clear next, its consolidation type movement in both the time frame Daily and H4 to predict now before trend line break it will be blind prediction without any base and clue, About bitcoin it should have been bought earlier. Now you should buy near to 8000.00 and 9000.00 and sell @ 1500.00 1600.00 there will be up and down movement in it. for full month but t will not cross ts peak. lower yu buy the more you benefit.

That is my analysis. What I see in bitcoin, rest of all the crypto I have no chart only bitcoin

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thank you very much satish37

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Satish, I agree about Eurgbp. On 4h tf it has formed symmetrical triangle. It could go in either direction. Keep eye open for which way it breaks out. It is near lower trendline now. But we need to wait.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
eurogbp is trading below 200 SMA in daily TF that is very important . it means your sell position is quite safe upto 50-60 pips

--- 帖子 #331 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #332 ---
yes good judgement , some wait is better

--- 帖子 #333 ---
CHFJPY: SL hit , trade lost  $34.20

GbpUsd: SL hit trade lost $63.35

AudNzd : closed neutral

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Satish. Is this live account?

I trade live but only very small. £0.1 per pip. So small gain/loss but valuable experience.

I traded chf/jpy and gbpusd, both with small gains (£7.72 and £7.85). But many trades buy/sell.

A lot of work, small gain, but learning. I hope.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Yes this is real account ,

normally I trade 0.1 lot some trades with .02,.03 , 0.01

Not a loss to my pocket , but unnecessary wasted profit, actually I made some mistake by not selecting the right setup except chfjpy that was correct setup, Gbp Usd I left It running due to over confidence, It is normal Wednesday will get double or triple,ChfJpy was in profit but at that time I was not here, when I checked that it had gone 6 point above my entry .

I trade for 50- 125 pips .

some time not get this much also example on Monday it is difficult to get this much.  But I am excited to see the coming setups iy will take 15 days to show the correct formation for good entry, let us see the next week what happens

--- 帖子 #336 ---
over confidence always punishes me. I am newbie so mostly caution, then a few wins, increase size for more profit, then punishment.

I look forward to Wednesday!

Past midnight here in Japan, so bedtime!

--- 帖子 #337 ---
yes correct

Hi Friends Food Morning and Happy Holiday ,

Today is Sunday and Analyzing day for trading,

We all know safety first, keeping this point in mind ,

EuroJpy: Down Trend started, correction very due, (Correction for 150-200 pips , look to buy)

UsdJpy : Down Trend started but cancelled by Usd being powerfull, correction due. (Easily look for 140-200 pips buy)

AudJpy Likely to take uptrend move, but is at the decision point of up and down. ( Buy above 84.13)

So Jpy likely to be week for the coming week. buy)

EuroUsd: It may take 3-4 days but a down movement is going to happen at any time, always look for sell the rallies in this pair.

I hope NFP will give great start of downward movement in this pair. Go below 1.2260 than rise to 1.2370 or 1.2392. Than fall below 1.2111.

Bitcoin expect 9235.00 handle to hold Below this can fall to further check or retest of last low, above 10000.00 free to move up , over all this should be a range market for months to come.

Exact Entry point will be posted during trading hours

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi satish

Thanks for update. Monday we should buy EJ, UJ or will wt to fall around 150 pips than buy?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
If you can get both pair down 60-70 pips is surplus and free bonus , for buy these pair, but for wait to go down to 100 pips means you can miss the trade . Reason is after analyzing all the pair not only one I have come to this result.

USDJPY: While Trading Keep SL 2 pips below the last low of USDJPY
EuroJpy: Keep SL @ 130.42 if this is hit than double your lot size and buy for 125 pips , than wait and sell @ 133.93-134.42
Euro Usd only buy below 1.2250 TP @ 1.2392 than Sell @ 1.2430 till than hold

Tôi không hiểu những gì bạn nói, nhưng thông điệp của tôi cho bạn là trong Forex sau khi hoàn thành khóa học thích hợp bạn sẽ cần một huấn luyện viên cá nhân có thể cho bạn biết làm thế nào để nhảy vào thị trường này và nơi để nhảy và hơn làm thế nào để được ra khỏi thị trường, trừ khi không có hy vọng. Đầu tiên bạn phải nghiên cứu sau đó mọi khái niệm lý thuyết rõ ràng, bạn sẽ được đưa vào thị trường này trong đào tạo trực tiếp bằng tay trong tay để bạn trở nên hoàn hảo hơn bạn sẽ hiểu nhiều điều về thị trường. Tôi có thể cho bạn đào tạo mà không có tiền nhưng kỷ luật của tôi là rất nghiêm ngặt trong thị trường này, vì vậy tôi không phù hợp như là một giáo viên trong Forex, tôi có thể cho bạn biết tên của một người nhưng ông đến từ Mỹ, để có được đào tạo từ ông không phải là rất dễ, nhưng nếu bạn may mắn có thể là [/ quote]

You are not loosing due to your trading but only due to wrong point of trade execution, Expert only place pending orders for their entry and let the market to come to them. This is very very important to make discipline,, only one disadvantage in this that you will miss some trades

--- 帖子 #347 ---
To protect ourselves from being against the trend ,  it is very important for me to take look on daily and weekly time frame than I trade on H1 time frame,

I suffered this by ignoring CHFJPY,but once the trade is executed , once I click than I accept my mistake and loss

--- 帖子 #348 ---
[quote = satish37; 10813626] {quote} Chỉ cần chờ vài ngày tôi sẽ cho bạn cơ hội để học thông qua tôi, bởi thời gian bạn chỉ đọc kỹ thuật channeling rất quan trọng, tôi không thể lên skypee hơn là tôi sẽ không có thời gian cho bản thân mình, tôi đã sử dụng skypee trong hơn 8 năm. [/ quote]

Trying to come online , I am out of state, Looked today at market butt the situations are same as posted earlier on the charts ,
look to sell eurousd 1.2392-1.2432 is best point to sell target is deep down so should not miss this trade so manage accordingly your sell position .
GbpUsd: in down trend.
Jpy all pairs in correction mode
Use some Technic while executing trades , to get immediate profit in all trades, for pull back better to use super adx
GbpUsd is ready to give nearly 200 pips, any time down ward force may capture market in gbpusd and eurousd, keep attention on these two pairs very easy and confidential trades for seller

Try this one with a small risk big rewards:
Bitcoin/Usd: Buy @ market price 8193.00  SL @ 7910.00 TP 11808.20 TP2 19700.00

--- 帖子 #381 ---
AudJpy: Pending buy @ 81.45 TP @83.50 SL 80.85

In fact this pair is pending in a swing to touch above 83.10
Than a final sell swing than has very long to go above 102.10
or the alternate trade you can buy AudChf which can go maximum 100 pips down only it has 100 pips space to down but up swing has more than 1000 pips to go
but do not place sell position in this pair

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Trên thực tế, cặp này đang chờ đợi trong một cú chạm để chạm vào trên 83.10 Hơn một lần bán cuối cùng swing hơn là có rất dài để đi trên 102.10 hoặc thương mại thay thế bạn có thể mua AudChf mà có thể đi tối đa 100 pips xuống chỉ có 100 pips không gian để xuống nhưng tăng swing có hơn 1000 pips để đi, nhưng không đặt bán vị trí trong cặp này [/ quote]

Hi seunboi .

I am out of state and station , here electricity and internet problem so I will upload when I will be at my native place

You can buy bitcoin and hold it for two months you can earn more than $2000 it is now at the time of writing this post nearly to its bottom. lowwer range shold not be below $4800 but it may not go there , one bounce to the new high is pending

--- 帖子 #387 ---
There no better opportunity than bitcoin trade in the whole forex market ,
How to Trade this crypto if you don't have enough money .
Just you need 400 to 500 $ place @ pending buy@ 5700.100 trade with lot size .05 place TP @ 18000.600, SL, 4900.00,
if this trade is not activated hold your breath wait for the market to touch below 5906.00 market will and must go below this point this is compulsory . than put pending buy @7100.00 and SL 6800.00 TP 18500.00

Expect eurousd : to bounce at 2189 for 30 -40 pips but that does not mean you should be out from sell trade
Eurousd must and will definitely go below this point(1.2000) but there will be zigzag motion .
because euro usd has registered its top and confirmed it to . So avoid taking buy position in this trade .

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Ether should still drop but do not put any trade. Just watch critical level to drop is 223.00, but I have doubt to drop at this level .

That is why just watch to that level do not take risk

Gold mine of todays trading is sell EuroUsd at any price above 1.2300 , rest nothing to do just if you can sell only sell above 1.2300

Gbp Usd can give you a dose beware of this pair avoid it up to tuesday

--- 帖子 #389 ---

--- 帖子 #398 ---
What Ma you are using in this chart the type and values ?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
correct , this chart was analysis ed more than 25 days before, but still it is in range of breaking upwards,

here audusd, audjpy, euroaud, GbpAud, have to be considered in synchronize with this move, which are approaching for that agreement, but chfjpy is pending for one upswing, that is why this pair (AudChf) is choppy. Also audnzd have agreed for up move just now it is time for market settlement once the mo0ve take off it will be like catching a flight.

Now let us see details about aud pairs ( Do not trade as it is priferical anlysis)

GbpAud : Down

EuroAud: down

AudUsd ; Up

AudJpy : up

AudNzd :up

ChfJpy: pending one move Up or 2 wave up

Euro Chf: in wave 3 or 5 up

Now if you know algebra you can know what the individual currency is saying and what is strength in it

Note when the pair is in down trend and I say it up that means it has completed its measurement in the down trend,

that is why i say euroaud down and gbp aud down because they are nearly completed in up move down swing is pending or started already

The blue line indicates the deepest move against the current trend. In this

example it is 233 pips. The whole move in this chart is 882 pips.

The trend drawdown is:

233 / 882 = cca 26%

Not bad. Conservative traders would prefer the trend drawdown to be below

20% as it is more reliable. The ‘big dogs’ prefer trends with drawdown even

below 15%. Such trends exist almost every day in at least one Forex chart.

Trends with drawdown below 10% are very rare, but when they appear, they

are gold mines – you can easily achieve a winning percentage above 90%.

I purchased it on unocoin site but due to its high variation of bid and ask price nearly 1000$ i Had transferred it to coinsecure exchange

now coinsecure is not online since morning may be  under DDoS Attack,

Yes I say will take out the last high which it made this year.

It is very simple and blind calculation it is 75% down of its total value.

Also charts says for upward move

Okay, Thanks so much. i can wait for as long ....... Thanks so much

It is really a matter of worry for me , if coinsecure dont come online . This Indian Crypto is under doubt in my mind. I wanted to transfer to Exness but transferred to coinsecure.

Most of the authorities in India have being doing such types of Illegal power involving some Govt  Ministers and RBI Governors and finally the companies will be gone  away with all the deposits of the client.   This is not the first time

No they aren't  this is the message they have on their site, since Sunday they have been saying updating no more news, but in India it is normal this type of fraud trend,

Bitcoin is challenge to the whole world politics , it will minimize their misuse of political power and will make people financially more powerful and give more freedom.

if the normal public is not poor the politicians can not use the public according to their desired will.  Their is great technology and IT mathematics behind it, and these the useless and junk politicians who have no mind are just ruling on your vote, just your vote makes and give power to them.

Even 98% of Indians do not understand the technology of blockchain and the Idea of Satoshi Nakamoto behind its creation.

But whether people believe or not this this new Invention of crypto-Bitcoin is no less than nuclear in matter  science.  It is not so difficult to understand.

Let me tell you the more subtle or fragile the the thing is the more difficult it is to be understood by the normal public,  in physical science nuclear is nothing as compared to virtual currency, I have seen the tree of nuclear disaster many years ago , which is greatest disastrous, but Bitcoin is great creative in the virtual world it is very easy for Bitcoin to make every individual of the world prosperous and happy.

But if you are happy and prosperous where will the politicians will go.  Their game of wars and manipulation will be gone from this earth

Why Bitcoin cannot go below $4800.00, this is the lowest point of bitcoin trading at current market price why?
80% of The world Govt are trying to pull it down. That is why it is now at this level. they cannot pull it down from its current level . Its normal level is near to $100000. Now you can imagine with a very little support and as time passes and more traders come in crypto market this is non stoppable.

Bitcoin is new dimension of IT + Mathematics.
Its trading has no effect of any news. It is based on total humanity growth. This the first step just start of new era new phase, It has no nation boundary. It is one world one currency system. Congratulation to all of you to have a good catching point at $6800.00.
It(Bitcoin) is free and fearless from Putin's Nuclear submarine, and Trumps Supersonic Air Fighters and XingPing's Mobiles deal or Trade conditions

There is chance of buy in audcad to take 120+ pips , but this is a slow pair , more over today is friday , you can keep SL at the last low. It is also possible it may hit your SL and than bounce back but buy for more than 120+ pips is sure. So holding is better , it will be better to keep SL 5 pips below last low.

Euro Gbp if crosses .8720 than exit sell as the pair is in sell mode  sell entry signal was above .8792

Keep selling this pair at every good rise or say bounce but do not sell in the bottom that will be waste of time though you will not loose but see loss for hour or a day

Close your BITCOIN trade and take profit, now it can reverse .

Euro/USD can be buy after touchbing 1.2156 for atleast 100 pips

Or you can try sell euro usd and put sl at 1.2156 that is upto you
but 1.2156 is level detector
EuroGbp is buy for minimum 30-40 pips without doubt can be more SL .8743
should go to .8840-8851

XAUUSD: sell in between 1332-1340 SL 1346 TP 1265.00

CHFJPY put buy @109.28 TP 114.45 SL 108.28
USDJPY: Bottom confirmed now we are waiting for one down swing than a very long buy

Aud Jpy should be buy for a very long range but it goes down than only expect it as the last swing but buy is certain. Expect buy for at lest six months range

I agree with OP. One pair is simplyfying everything. Focusing on 5-10 pairs can result in lots of losses because the strategy is not the same for every pair. I know an expert advisor for one pair and it works "almost" all the time. The only thing is: too costy!

EuroGbp should show sudden fall if not than any how it must fall below .8400, the upward leg should have been complete, or gbp can be weak in gbpusd but here also one spike should be above 1.3610 and than it may fall or may not but down cycles not complete.

It has great potential as per monthly chart .

Now we need to see strength of aud comparing with other pairs

Aud usd : not analysed yet

as this is monthly chart of aud jpy

but jpy has less steam , any how this is long term based,

over all view of euro usd and Gbp usd:

on daily base they are approaching to 2.61 fibo in euro usd

and gbpusd has reached 161.8 fibo level

so here a bounce for iv or 4 at both degree is pending

so great potential for 200 pips bounce

confirmation point of buy in euro usd is 1.1754 tgt 1.1942

confirmation point of buy in gbp usd is 1.3421 tgt 1.3602

Aud Cad: highest point of wick in daily chart is SL and TP below .9540 but expect break of .9540 and tp to be below .7450

BTCUSD: maximum fall 6000.00, @current price expect it to rise to minimum 9800.00 but may check 11543.00

Attachment g

--- 帖子 #440 ---
can some on post daily and H4 chart of Aud/Cad here i have some problem in my mt4

If counts are correct in euro usd fall should be limited to max 1.1483,  but should today start the 4th wave and reach to 1.1911 in three steps or near to 1.2000

GbpJpy: Pending Buy @ 144.25 SL 143.71 TP 149.50 or may be 164.48 (Do not execute before 144.25)

Aud/Cad is good selling trade with SL .9830 (nice trade) TP 200pips
Gbp/Usd pending buy @1.3345 SL 1.3269 TP 1.3845

BtcUsd same as previous set up always reserve profit in this trade not good setup but sell trade is risky better to avoid
EuroUsd : buy and hold till 1.1911 SL 100 pips

--- 帖子 #442 ---
reserve profit in all trades except gbpjpy it is all correction.

Gbpy jpy has big potential for up side if it takes last low than too it will com up with more power
but euro usd be carefull it need to be updated every 4 hours.
concentrate on few pairs two or three, as "too many cooks spoil the broth "
gbpusd wait for clear signals or better buy below 1.3390 and than hold it
EuroUsd take profit and let market go to below 1.1630 and than buy and take profit @ 1.1770

GbpUsd is in consolidation with euro usd keep low volume and small risk over all tgt should go to 1.3800 yet there is but in this pair if any news pending it must favor gbp gbpusd is extremely oversold selling this pair is not a wisefull ness selling gbpusd at this stage is much risky , if you loose better loose in buy trade in gbpusd

Exness.com paid me today the amount, was held in payment gateway and bank staff does not know what is auth code and ARN No.
It means broker is not scam.

Hopping payment from coinsecure.in  too they will give me original amount.  Not earned Amount
Fuck, they wasted my time , because I could not concentrate on my trading.

Four pairs updated

Why we dont make up money in trading?

Reason is quite simple :

1.   It takes more than four to five years to be a perfect strategy master and some times even more time to bring confidence in that strategy because it involves money.

2.   When we adopt some sort of signals provider , than too in greed to make money we follow the signals provider but can't bring confidence and trust in those signals

signals services.

3.  So to be a profitable trader, we have to learn two or three such strategy , master them have confidence and implement them, keeping in mind that some trades will hit the Stop Loss that is also part of training and part of this business.

So in human life the main element of success is faith ,trust and confidence + learning habit

Previous week Result: Lost two trades in Euro/Gbp loss -60 pips. Aud/Jpy: - 170 pips Btc/Usd running loss -$7.15

Profit trades : EuroUsd: +170 pips Gbp/Jpy: +267 pips EuroJpy : +15 pips GbpUsd: +60 pips
Forcast for 11 Jun 2018 to 15 Jun 2018
Euro Usd highest touched 1.1840, now expect decline in eurousd to a new low, as long as 1.1840 hold
JPY , Aud and CAD expect some new unexpected changes.
A trader is always in a habit to be in a trade all the time:
if you are trading USD/CAD: Keep SL at 1.3069 TP1 1.2735/TP2 1.2526/TP3 1.2248
Xau/Euro : has immediate bullish scenario as long as price hold 1087 expect to rise to 1200
Cad/Jpy : expect decline or wait for peanut point breakout may take 1 week to settle, expected down move below 80.34, but peanut can break upside to, for sell trade , 87.37 should hold

BTC/USDending buy @4300-5300 TP@ 40000 yearly trade SL is not required last chance to enter BTC/USD
after that it will be a dream to buy bitcoin

Euro Usd: if support proved to be strong between range 1.1715-1.1762, than sell prediction likely to be fail. or this pair should be range bound in this zone (1.1892-1.1715)

Also note that today after getting some fresh tick my won analysis says euro usd to hit above 1.1900 handle

Back For Your Service

GbpJpy: Below 146.90 Sell TP 143.62 SL 149.08(good)

EuroUsd: Buy @market price SL 1.1481 TP 1.2062  (good)

EuroChf: TP 1.1550    SL 1.1428  (fair trade )

GbpUsd : 1.3112 only TP

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Out Look Scenario For All Pairs :

GbpJpy if 146.90 not broken than Fifth wave will take the pair beyond 152.10 so you can put SL 146.88 for buy trade and and pending sell @ 146.88 with SL 147.62

( Both way good opportunity )  (Buy)  fifth way should start

Euro Jpy : SL for Buy Trade is 129.30 TP 133.12 or above (Buy)  3 of 3 to occur

EuroChf : buy as burst from triangle

Euro Usd :  Buy as  five waves down completed  5th at smaller degree to occur

Usd Jpy:  Buy TP  144.44    SL 111.83  5th of c to occur or E to start both way up target

So in coming days Euro to get strongest and Jpy to be week

USD & Gbp Medium Usd Chf down target at .9750 or near to it

Euro Gbp :  Still expect down below .8847 Target lies at .8675   The limit for wave E is 0.8621 so there is plenty of room for lower

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Gbp/Usd :  TP hit

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Short term Signals:

GbpUsd : sell 1.3172-1.3192 TP 1.3080 SL not needed

EuroUsd: Sell 1.1622-1.1633 TP 1.1529 SL 1.1672

GbpJpy : sell 147.08 TP 1.45.92 SL 147.62

EuroUsd must touch above 1.1615 to keep levels intact , if does not and revert below 1.1610

than all counting will be invalid

One free signal very solid : Euro Usd : buy @ current market price i.e. 1,1455 SL 1.1429 TP 1.1627

If this SL is hit you will get greater opportunity for sell trade that will be posted later but this SL shuld be safe at any cost

Any how  breaking beleow 1.1400 than too retracement to 1.1530-1550 can not be denied .

that is reason for this trade being very solid

--- 帖子 #463 ---
As some of you might have seen in my previous post . I calculate signals with great involvement. So you might have seen over all greater profitability.

There are methods to calculate every swing and reason behind them . There is certain some calculation are there. But that need five types of strategy in mind . We need to know which force is involved in that current move. So there is greater involvement to calculate not so easy . As soon as market reverses we should know exact with confirmation that it is now reversed so that either we take SL, or reverse the trade with double but should have solid confirmation. Otherwise it is not trading but a online gambling habit where we loose money . Just accidentally I met a  person on line . Who lost and is loosing more than seven lakh $.

I have checked his account even he has taken loan for trading. This is very dangerous attitude and should be avoided. Trading coaches (training) are very costly.

To save that money traders loose more that that . Remember without proper Technic and good weapon you can never fight your enemy.

Training  is your weapon and Technic.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
very Nice to see Strong Support Hold. One more retest of the support can not be denied but any how keeping this support in mind you can Take TP any where upto 1.2128 , it is upto you. As I see market should advance upto 1.2128

Target for XRP within next  3 to 5 yrs is nearly to $300 (minimum) could be above $600.

You need not to trade any thing just purchase and hold them in your private hardware wallet and keep the security keys and password safe , do any other job

just purchase and forget .  image how much you will earn after 5 yrs < I say five but it could be a very jump rise in three years .

If you like can try this EA is in Russian language , I have no clue about it how this works or nor, if it is ok let me know, today any clue about eurousd? let us discuss, I have decided to trade this pair in up move with a SL below 1.1192 I am aiming 1st TP @ 1.1497 with non stop move and than after retracement of few pips 2nd TP > 1.1600 without caring for NFP

I would like to share one more thing : UsdJpy chart show me down move in weekly and daily chart as per my view it should go minimum 300pips down .

My second view is EuroJpy: to me I see this one also down but am doubtful coz some senior analyst suggest up move . Comparing various pairs I see Usd to be weak in coming days as per charts . But reading sellers articles they say it to be stronger. To me if $index makes a new high than we can expect eurousd to be down otherwise my probability shud work

I forgot to mention my protective SL in UsdJpy is 114.54 to gain 300 pips down which is 1:3 risk/reward not a bad decision

Tomorrow after Asian session i would like to scalp posting my scalping trades here

--- 帖子 #475 ---
The strategy is not good if it fails on many pairs.   A good trending strategy EA should work on at least 10 - 14 pairs over a couple of time periods or its a risk.

Reversal strategy's normally work better with one of my EA's works on 21 pairs, often on three time frames.  The best time frames for many EA's is often H1, H4 & Day.

I do run a portfolio of EA's so I know how to judge a good or bad EA.

Is there any probability for Indians to buy Bitcoin ? If any one knows please let me know how ?

I see a long buy in gbpusd may be some fundamental behind it if my prediction is wrong than to it calculate 45 pips buy but should be long buy, if it is buy than SL @ 1.2774 should  remain safe till it hit 1.2845 than we can proceed for further target

EuroUsd: Usd not willing to loose its strength . Euro trying to fight , Usd is really a mighty currency so all signals and charts are failing. Profit will not be easy

So decided not to trade this pair . Only negative Us data gives some power to Euro. Euro is like Cyn in front of USD . So it is better to place buy and sell keeping in mind USD is stronger. If not now or in four months or six months Usd will again prove its mightiness.

So I plan to buy Btc @ 3477.00 and hold good and risk free idea without tense

So exiting from EuroUsd and UsdJpy trades with a little profit . Will decide on Friday. Charts analysis are EuroUsd buy and Usd Jpy Sell .

First I execute trade in my mt4 than I post here .

If I post my Indicators trades or all setup trades No doubt If you take them all definitely you will be in profit by 200-300 pips per day  . But that is not my way , I believe in first follow your self than speak.  If you want my setup trades than you have to be very fast and let me know but I too have too be smart and active in typing

Today Euro Usd created one of the best opportunity to enter and buy with SL 1.1258 and TP 1.1745

Market is trading at 1.1374, any how if this is 1st swing of corrections the second swing belongs to buyers

Both way buyers should get profit if not 100/200 pips but at least 40 pips can not be denied , but i see target at 1.1800 or somewhere near to it

Investing Big amount in Forex /Trading is fatal Error . Instead of investing big amount a trader should invest minimum and be patient to develop the amount with occasional withdrawal habit. because when retails traders invest more than $3000 it is a fatal mistake your money used by your broker who ever broker may be against you. 100% broker trades against you . your money is used against your money.

Technically +Mathematically lot size of 0.3 in euro usd gives best opportunity to your broker for 500 pips to stay against you without investing any single dime from his  pocket.

Though it also need to consider Average Daily Range .  For the most volatile pair you need to consider 1500 pips range and for pairs like eurousd and audusd consider maximum 400 pips .

Taking Stop Loss in view $ 1500 is the best and maximum amount to start for a trader.

Above this amount it means we are already determined to loose.

And to cover the lost amount is almost impossible , reason big fall or rise in the market happens only in A leg of a wave or in the third wave or more accurate third of the third wave which does not happen to be always , A wise trader will always wait and enter and hold positions in third and third of third wave or when wave 5th is ripped he will enter and hold

Right Point to Buy Eurousd: 1.1432 if It retrace to this level as it has crossed above 1.1502 Trend is now in bullish mode. But placing sell trade is risky at this stage and buy should be placed only on retracement

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Buy UsdCad; 1.32426 but not below this point SL 1.32172 TP1 1.32726 but buy can extend to TP2 1.32936

The other very good point of buy usdcad : is the point from where swing two should start and that exact or somewhere near by point is 1.3145/1.3162/1,3168

than tuou can take TP 150 pips easily . when usd cad reach this point eurousd will be ripped off for correction for wave 2 of 1 of 3.

But cathing exact point need to glay/watch the trading terminal or you can place a pending buy order , due point of correction of eurousd is 1.1599/1.1634

though it may consume the whole day

AudCad: Buy @ .9480 TP .9552 SL .9315 Target could be much higher will be updated on movement.

Xau Euro : should start falling below 1192 but any how should not cross 1213 or could start falling below 1186

1st target at 1093

XauUsd: 1346 is the limit from here start the fall of gold , long term traders can expect to fall below 1000.00

fall can accelerate any time as gold is down in 3/3 of the triagular way . Earlier limit of triagular wave was 1370.00 . 1346 is considered as the top of 2nd wave.

EuroUsd: Oversold expect to rise to 1292-1321. Let us see if reaches this level to get one more sell opportunity

GbpUsd : Our requirement is market to touch 1.3261, if this condition is full filled we are ready to go short for target 1.2960, with stop just above today's high means we will keep SL at 1.3382

EuroGbp Just buy and Take TP .8670 Pips keeping todays Low as SL.

Correction in Gbp Pair Gbp/Usd and Euro Gbp one more swing pending to upside to take out current high ,
for precaustion in GbpUsd for Buy trade Keep SL 1.3144 and Tp just above 1.3379 pvious said sell below 1.3261 amended same is applicable for EuroGbp

EuroUsd: If takes out 1.1338 Possible target raise to 1.1338+42= 1380 keeping in view 1.1419 is measure as down trend above which level changes.

To aim 1.1380 we must know a stop loss level also other wise targets are useless without protecting account.

S we need to place stop loss just 1.1303 less spread or 1.1299 , for this market must touch 1.1338

Gbp Usd : new entry avoid , for those who are already in trade .

As per my indicator it is in sell mode below 1.3288.

Structure also in sell mode

Only price action is favoring up move

moving average SMA 50 say down

For those who wants to make their living as trading and dont have job , want to earn good amount of money to enjoy life nicely and live luxury style but not filmy style

but good  money , than must have minimum $11000/-  account balance/equity  that is equal to nearly 7 lakh indian rupees .

200 pips per day i.e. 200x70 = 14000 per day maximum trade size not to exceed 0.05 and manageable allowed 6 trades limit for account .

2 trades for emergency and 4 routine trades

New Target in Gbpusd Established above 1.3400

EuroUsd : Down Side move is unexpected but yet it should not go below 1.1250, 1.1300 right entry point for target above 1.1447 , keeping in view the lower low below 1.1200 I expect one more high to be above 1.1447 it could be the effect of some data , let the dust settle down for new movement

EuroUsd:

Aud Jpy: long target @ 80.28 entry 77.28

EuroJpy : long entry @ 122.72 target @ 134.50

Jpy pair likely to rebound

Gbp Usd Trade failed SL hit -29 pips Now executed sell for target 150 pips down entry 1.3192 SL 1.3229

NZD/USD: buy with no sl no tp targeting just 70 pips with +/-

Gold damaging account rising more than my expected range

This week coming lot of volatility

Though Iam long on eurousd but I see devergence in stock in this pair indicates can jump down at any time

Dont forget to buy usdcad @ 1.3345 or 1.3350 for a target of 1.3492

A risk of $3.60 on two trades image attached let us see the result.

Today got two SL on same pair gbpusd , is not it a miracle , when I sell It goes buy when I buy it just touches my SL and than come back

I don't have anything else to do in my life , but I need money to survive , lot of money has been deceived by govt bank , there is no space for me to earn else where

except this forex market and for me it is easiest way

Today I might be uploading a best indicator for traders who are loosing , so they stop loosing and start earn , but before you get on the road you must learn some traffic rules so here goes those rule :

1st rule is there is something that market can do but yet there is some thing that market can not do , that is base .

2nd Rule is money management bear in your mind the money you loose can on be covered by the same lot size you lost .

so must stick with this must formula fix your lot size .

3rd need to enter the same trade even 10 times but SL should not be big

4th Rule is in a trending market in a daily trend or weekly trend hourly TF are points where markets pull back or retraces,  this indicator will show you the pullback points and trending points .  The trick will be to take advantage of pull back and trending market

ok now wait for indicator , the upload will not be permanent will be removed after 30 minutes , as this will be for few people only to help the needed ones

Good Morning All !

Manual of the above tpl is being uploaded :

My view on GbpUsd : likely to hit 1.3105, and might touch above level 1.3203  but any how yesterday high should be SL level and 1.2905 should be target

My yesterday failed trades : EuroUsd, EuroChf

--- 帖子 #507 ---
part of above post.  About my own experience , if you read instructions and follow the rules ,, it is very very economical method.  It is certain your account will grow,  The owber of this system has explained very nicely

Euro Gbp Likely to be above .8602 as divergence seen in stochastic

AudUsd : might start moving down to below .7005

Usd Cad both signals buy and sell but recommended buy @ 3362 for 1.3442 only applicable for today trade must be closed today at loss/profit

sell not recommended as it will go in sell trade advancing in corrective mode , any how it is a both way trade

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Gold take Profit if return to 1303.00 can be risk for sellers or alternate way is put SL at 1302.00

Another trade EuroChf Buy for TP minimum at 1.1245 reason over sold too much . pull back must be can be more for safety I say minimum

My Good Morning with this trade

End of Week : Happy weekend

Aud:Usd: Will be Trade for consideration week starting 1 Apr 2019

--- 帖子 #511 ---
According to Lindencourt MX Method Aud Usd is going in sell mode for the target of . 7065 and we can keep SL @ 7140 excluding spread , remember excluding spread if you can not understand excluding word it means add spread to .7140 i.e, 7140+2.6

Todays means Monday's target for some pairs :

EuroGbp: .8570 immediate trade after hiting this target hold and wait than buy @ .8533 and than TP @ .8700 or above

Aud jpy , eurojpy ,usdjpy , gbp jpy on hold wait

Gbp Cad : just keep selling the more higher you get better hold sell it in the late evening or tomarrow morning

Gbp usd : Buy tp @ 1.3110 and than sell @ 1.3167 immediate trade target for sell trade is 1.2908

Cad Jpy you are free to buy and take profit 500-800 pips but better point of buy is .8289-.8295

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I think by the evening Jpy pair will forecast the further its plan , but till now no information can be gathered,but if no volatility in market than I can not say anything about half cooked rice. But EuroJpy AudJpy UsdJpy GbpJpy are going to bring something nice now is time to wait watch and relax .

--- 帖子 #513 ---
GbpAud : Strong Sell Target 1.7934 ,

As the pair is highly volatile, I have checked it in three dimensions . Normally I do not trade some pair , GbpAud is also one of them but this time the case is exceptional, and the chart is very clear to me . When the chart speak to me I accept it

usdcad : still no evidence of down trend still having higher low , a new low can consider to think about something changing

GbpUsd: Pair is not accelerated as it should do , also eurousd unable to break its daily low at 1.1176, so there can be something wrong in down ward movement better sell trader to reserve profit

--- 帖子 #514 ---
gbpusd : pair target might have changed to above 1.3147

There are possibility that after hitting over 1.3147 it may bounce back to 1.2900 handle but not sure , because 1st we have to see how much above 1.3147 it goes .

Any how watching it

Any how if this pair fail to break 1.3147 but come very closer to hit than it will be clear the minimum target toward 1.2430 or more than we can say cable weak in real sense

--- 帖子 #515 ---
EuroJpy: Can be targeted 126.18 entry poimt 124.85 or 124.92

AudJpy : Though in buy mode heavy uptrend started but one more swing to down side pending 78.34 is right entry to buy this pair

Nzd Cad : buy signal seen at .9021 for 30-40 pips this signal is produced by my favorite indicator divergence in stock and macd

update gbpusd : down trend not changed till white circle is not taken out,

1.3206 at this point market can reverse protect your money , just for information only

crucial point for resumption of down trend are 1.3206 and 1.3235 above 1.3235 we can assume market has means gbpusd is in uptrend unless it remains in its down trend

GbpJpy: Today if movement sell @ 147.35 TP 143.10 but possible not to reach that point , now depend on you where to catch this trade if you won't miss it can catch now vision should be target and i.e. 142.28 or 143.10

--- 帖子 #517 ---
A little bit of discussion on EuroUsd: Technically speaking a Daily TF of this has been uploaded on Mar 24 . As Market has been rejected at 1.1283 & unable to break 1.1276. What I think is . EuroUsd should proceed above 1.1300. but it can be tried only after break of yesterday's candle. or it may be possible try to take out 1.1447

Let us see in coming days . If it be true , it will be new base and more confidence for me to believe HH and LL theory

Today is 5th of Apr 2019: Good Friday

Here on Forex Factory let us make money together

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Trading is not just for money for me, how I came here in this field , I do not know , But it was just by chance, I was in search of job and earning. After trying many PTC and Matrix sites and HYIPs I accidentally fell here.

I accepted the challenge of learning it, I was not aware if others are trading in the world. I was so ignorant about it. After 1.1/2 years of self and alone fighting with trading I came to know there is some basic training about it . 14 Dec 2012 was my First day, than I never looked back just seating on a bad with laptop Desktop day and night gazing at the screen it became my life , except tools I learned nearly all the available strategy in this world .

First when started It was exciting ,curious, desire for money. But the Time consumed was worth more than what I could found here.

Now it is a habit for me Just like smoking.

Now I take Trading easy , I know there is no way either hit SL or TP .

What type of method I adopt is , if my SL is hit I know the range it will come back or not than I adopt the second method with doubling lot .

For example yesterday on friday crude oil hit my SL but I know it is bound to return below 70.00 and the target is below 55.00

Sometimes the pairs are at critical zones example if EuroUsd bounce from this level than for years this level will not be touched but if still goes down withing one two or three month this level will again be touched.

Which is most important level to look for before entering in a trade . That is the importance of SL and money management .

TP is profit but SL is also profit it saved your account from being washed out

--- 帖子 #521 ---
From 8th Apr 2019 , I will be covering live trades , with instant updates, but which pairs ? only pair that will seem bo be giving profit /money .

Why should I cover doubtful or unclear charts , so who are willing stay with updates from Monday to Friday, let us get at least 500 pips for a week.

First condition is or will be reserve profit after every 20-30 pips

This is a Euro Usd Daily Chart : in the the chart there are two dotted lines , what is pressure ? if the pair cross down the lower dotted lines than id down ward pressure applicable otherwise it can rise to any upper level this is the key secret of trading

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Traders sometimes ignore very important levels of Profit ,

BtcUsd : Sooner or later 23.6% or 38.2% levels will be touched

UsdJpy: Some Charts :

Gbpusd H1 : Chart

Now from tomorrow live market will tell us which wave count is working , or which wave is in progress, this much chart work has been done , because usdjpy divergence is telling 50-60 pips or may be 100 pips downward move. So I had to consider the alternate count

Last image is showing divergence on daily TF which is very strong signal which made me to work extra two hours on Sunday.  But we will see it tomorrow in live market

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Scalping Technic: very very strong :

1. Sets of bollinger bands: Periods 50 shift 0 Deviations 2 colour #Red

2. Period 50. Deviation 3 (Orange) period 50 shift 0 Deviations 3 colour #Orange

3. Period 50. Deviation 4 (Yellow) period 50 shift 0 Deviations 4 colour #Yellow
All apply to close :

Now, price will constantly range between these lines.

Sell strategy:

When price crosses the upper red band , at least half way to the orange band (if it

gets to the yellow band is better but not as usual) Then the price will tend to retrace

towards the center of the bollinger bands, you profit form this retracing

For buy reverse the above:
TF : only 1M to 15 M Pairs gbpjpy, gbpaud, gbpcad and euroaud only highly volatile pairs
Indicator : attached below, align trade with yellow bar in histerogram
see the pick ;

Caution: SL not to exceed 5 pips exclude spread, Target only 10-15 Pips, London session the best,
Avoid during news

AudUsd : Sell @ CMP( current market price) Target .7062 SL 7135

Cad Jpy : buy @ 83.49 TP 84.03 SL 83.28

GbpUsd: still on hold in simple language time and momentum can take it to maximum level 1.3111 than expect a strong sell pressure

Update GbpUsd: Traders Active , UK Parliament inactive

EuroUsd : In Buy mode minimum to reach 1.1262 , we have to wait to finish downward acceleration . better if pair finish $ domination

Exit this trade in profit(eurousd)

Crude oil: Sell @63.32 TP 62.28 signal based on divergence. SL 63.70

Hello Satish37. Thanks for effort in helping others. I have learnt a lot from you. Could you single out one system among all you`ve taught here that is most profitable? Elliotwave repaints. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
My English is weak , so try to understand,

1st Elliot wave does not repaints, it is uploaded indicator which repaint, this I found on web to help estimate when a wave is going to end in scalping as shown in above bollinger band combinations.

2nd Elliot wave in it self is non repaint system , it is only individual how he reads the wave , sometimes waves are advancing in impulsive manner some times in corrective manner.

3rd Single system here means , holding one pair , monitoring it in Daily,  H4  and H1 time period. Counting every move, every wave  in H1 will bring accuracy but this method is though most accurate but very slow.  Change in trend is immediately noted by this method.  For safety there is provision of alternate count . Account rarely blow out but grow .

To bring profitability (profit) we have to add something more to our knowledge which can work in any market condition and is solid as EW

4th There are found three types of divergence in trading ,  Regular Divergence , Hidden Divergence, Exaggerated Divergence.

If you master divergence , you will have mastered your trading.

I will post means upload some material on this subject.  Just a chart is being uploaded for your view and see the result in coming days.

The next chart is based on EW you will see minimum wave c will equal to  a as shown in chart

Hope I could answer what is asked if not let me know I will try again to answer

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Try to read this usdjpy chart what it say : H4 must give you atleast 30 pips minimum, double bull means buy, on H4 SL always 30 pips on D1 SL always 50 pips,

minimum target in H4 50 pips in D1 50 pips-150 pips

Silver (XauUsd) must fall below 14.80 to complete wave c of wave 2 correction where as gold Xauusd target also lay at <1262 so wave in both metal is due should start today

Best Point to sell gold is near 1307.00 to 1309.00 for targeting 1262.00 or 1268.00

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Thank you. I got your point.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
UsdCad : this pair upward move was thrust from triangle, and target was toward 1.3600, but pair has come down reason in my view is rising crude oil is giving power to Cad as it is related with crude.

2nd crude though moving strongly in up move, but should not forget after all it is correction of wave 1 as wave 2 .  sooner or later it going to come in sell mode(very very down). So as long as 1.3251 exact point remain safe . Usd cad can provide better buying option with more profit.

let us see the result within just two days breaking below 1.3251, reject wave count and ask for reconsideration

GbpUsd : Sell @ 1.3088 SL 1.3116 TP 1.2970 , as in image if e point is broken go long otherwise keep short see image.

if gbpusd goes short that in not point to tell or mention that eurogbp is going to hit .8700 , this should be common understood if there any special news of euro than only change happen any how this is not a topic just for info

--- 帖子 #534 ---
As today is Wednesday , momentum should take place if any how not today than Thursday , my view in these two days market moves with momentum.

Nothing New all said earlier are proceeding accordingly . Price is King so Market is going to move at its own . SL point will either throw you out from the game or your TP will add some or more pips to your account . Trust yourself .

Gold and Silver and crude and GbpUsd hoping for hit target. (

I am aiming crude to hit 59.21 1st than more because 59.21 is just 23% at least 38.2% should be hit to wards down

There is possibility Gold and Silver Complete their target with strong downward spike and start their up move

so in Gold and silver TP must be set so you can be benefited

Target for Gold 1262.00 and 1245.00 you reserve at 1269

Target for Silver 1445.00  you reserve at  1470.00 or 1480

Target for crude 59.64 reserve at 61.55

--- 帖子 #536 ---
GbpUsd: Rejection and change observed, effort to break e point is being in progress , buy applicable only above breaking e

Where will be target after e ?

It should be minimum in 1.3383 , but could be more after retracement , for the time being its trend can be said changed but must cross "e" point for that to be valid

otherwise it will be in old trend

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Just a 30-40 pips trade, if you like for short term also good for long term

EuroChf : Sell@ 1.1307 TP 1.1047 for long term for short term TP 1.1265 SL 1.1385 ( SL for long term ) short term handle accordingly

GbpUsd : sell below 1.3054 TP & SL adjust according to pips desired

There is no harm in buying cad/jpy for 30 pips

Also should be ready to sell crude wait for right time to sell dont sell it immediately let it finish it steam completely

Finished my trading for tomorrow too yet market is inviting for trading . but enough is enough .

Though my update o oil is it will complete the gap first by tomorrow before London session.

Than change direction for downward it is my view and assumption I can be wrong too but i dont think i should be wrong , let market decide wrong or right,

In the previous post I forget to mention target for Usd Zar : it is above 14.7000 but you adjust according to your chart or swing

Oil trader who hold positions should aim not less than 58.00

Euro Chf : for sell position should give at least 100 pips , but there are possibilities could rise to 1.1482 not sure but could patience is required in this trade but 100 pips must be achieved in sell trade

Avoid gbp/usd pair for at least two day

For any other pair no clearance , but one trick on the close of Mondays bar put pending buy and sell order 25 pips above and 25 pips below Mondays bar with SL 25

pips +ve trade will give direction for the week the other will get hit SL

what else can u expect from a free indicator,

It can bring you 50-40 pips per day , if you know how to use it , accidentally i came across this indicator on Saturday and implemented on my real account

A cable is a Cable , if it break 1.2960, or probably 1.2949 , it will be under heavy sell pressure but dont expect buy unless there is any very very good favorable news.

Though sell has no risk but will be very boring ,

update on cadjpy : today I am not in any trade, but yen is doubtful , I am waiting for clear picture from under the bridge and over the bridge.

It is not that we will not loose trades ,

Hi Friends & my fellow traders,

Very Good Morning of the Wednesday a new day of the week for good start of new entry to earn some nice pips . Here goes my analysis , sometimes it can be wrong and some times it can bring some pips , but excuse me I can't give you enticement and false dream of 1 Million, I am lover of truth and reality.
Though Forex is the toughest business but careful trading can convert 100 into 1000 and than 1000 into 10000, small and steady consistent always wins .

Let me take the Crude first , as said earlier , now no more steam left in it , simple, now hold and earn in sell mode without SL if you have $50 in account volume not more than 0.01. at least make $50 to $75 in single trade.

GbpUsd: it is cable can hit 1.2900 /1.2800 in third way it is going towards 1.2500 in daily trend , yesterday I warned buyers before move. In fact hourly trend picture is still not clear to me where should end 3rd in hourly , suggestion is sell the big rally in hourly only till 1.2880-90. Stay and hold just got up from sleep and still have to look the charts

Aud Usd: Brothers as per my wave analysis uptrend of Aud is dead, what does I mean wait and let it rise 50-80 pips than sell your trade will be safe ,
there is money in data , not that some traders loss and some makes , data means economical growth , we all can make money when we trades towards data side .
yes true big volumes consume data rapidly makes money fast than side way market is struggle news days are best opportunity to earn collectively

NzdJpy : has signal to rise expect at least to rise 50 pips i.e. 74.37+50 should be target, but is should be

NzdUsd: Stop selling this pair it can start rising at any time , just a little bit of data support to kiwi and it will start in up move not up but big up .
keep eye on news for nzd
Most importantly is Euro Usd : it will take time to analyse , hold when i will be clear I will update , risk is still towards down still in unclear picture

One of My friend , trading since 1990, who told me first the name forex, has a good team of 15-25 followers , always,  wherever he will register they all will register, in fact he was a loudly talker a pure foolish man, following the European adequate , I remained friend with him for a long but with less concern. He will regularly give news and information  which I never listen, (normally I have never listened to anyone in my life nor admire any personality of Historic time) or say past time . Reason is not ego but I had always success in life due to my own ways only .

He used to guide me trade this pair with a target so and so . I will just say where to put SL, his reply will always be , "I dont use Stop loss" .

So will be the answer of his all the followers , I dont use Stop Loss.

My reply was and  always ok with silence.

Once with some broker sites and so called Forex expert of thousands years and millions of experience he advertised and made many more people to put the money in Forex.  He asked me to put the money and make thousands, I said ok tomorrow, but that tomorrow never  reached when ever asked again , I will reply one more morrow on tomorrow .

Once by mistake he showed me his account and his followers also showed me their account . The So called Forex expert team made them a gain of 450 to 600$.

He told me , this is called trading.

I told very nice , very good keep on going.  He was going praising himself and so called expert, by the time I had discovered the method of holding the right vein of Forex trading or Market.

After being bore of listening , I replied him , do you have just two minutes to listen , just listen carefully are you ready can I speak ?

He said what you want to say ?

Seeing his GbpJpy trade with lot 0.1 lot size , with equity 1600$ , my reply was your account will be blown out within two days ,

and all your followers are going to finish their balance withing two days .

But it was not two days that evening he was left with $100.

And all his followers lost 5000/7000/1000/2000/600 because $600 was minimum requirement by the so called Forex Expert.

Next morning he said Forex is not good , all the followers asked for their money which he guaranteed them to make millionaire.

On the Third day he had to close his skypee account changed him phone number .

He told me what he did , I told him I know , question was how I answered just like trees has shadow human has shadow genius and intellectual has shadow ,

my friend fools too have shadows, I had seen your shadow.

I wanted to give a update on GbpUsd: but keeping in mind a long term trend and considering it as a correction , I am reminding it again it is correction , in my view we should not trade correction but should trade with the major trend

GbpUsd correction should reach 1.2967

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Just week or two week , than should come a very nice volatility the best earning opportunity and movement will not be boring. But today is Friday . Means there will be directional set ups.

This is not my Trading advisement, but analysis nor I claim it to be 100% accurate , if Euro/Usd falls it could reach to 1.1056 but this will not happen , before rising to 1.1330 . Risk makes money in Forex

To keep my post number less ,I keep writing in a same post again and again ,if new post is not necessary.

Don't panic about EuroUsd up move it is a little bit of monthly candle resistance , but it is enclosed in between monthly resistance and support I expect 1.1225 by the today close . But it has already formed bottom so there is no question of below 1.1330 & that is the point where a Have set up my TP.

I am very flexible if Bottom is taken out I will enter buy again . so nothing to worry

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I believe accuracy is the most important factor. Thanks for sharing.

In my Trading life , I have never come across such a beautiful buy signal,, which Euro/Usd has provided me just now , I love such nice buy entry even if this type of signal give me continuous ten looses I will accept happily

--- 帖子 #553 ---
On Friday late Night Market Closes, than On Monday it opens. This is a routine , but most important is on Saturday and Sunday. is thought of days before Friday and days after Monday. And in between these Friday and Monday analysis , a young man of 30 will be 40 or 50 or even 60. Those 10 or 20 or 30 yrs will be missing from life just for a success which has not been achieved yet. This is mostly the life of a trader. Moreover how much hard earned money has been lost depends on individual trader, that need not be mentioned , some poor guys like me might have lost 1000$ including $400 signal service fee in 9 yrs of this long voyage.

Last question will be did you achieved success, if achieved, how much have you made or still loosing in a hope to win .

The answer is : 1st Stop loosing immediately .

2nd your past valuable time can not be regained it is never possible .

3rd is learn to play , and win is there.

4th I have been always against big lot size money should come if it is $4-$5 per day ok , but if you loose $5 immediately close the position.

How to Play in Forex in Real Time , Read all previous post , Oil in demo account see the chart :

Allo see Euro Chf, Gold , Silver and many more

Aud Jpy : Pending sell @ 78.10 TP 77.45 SL 78.80

UsdCad: Stop Loss 1.3518 TP 1.33330 buy entry 1.3521 TP 1.3667 SL 1.3479

Just patience is needed to triple your account within a month, just a little doubt is cleared from the charts , than we will get the flight in right time , but remember you can not travel in flight without ticket but in Trains you can

When I am really in trouble?

Oil is showing long down trend and UsdCad ADX Force indicator showing Usd Cad strong down .

XauUsd and XagUsd : are going up whereas too much down swing is still incomplete.

As Today is Monday 1st day of new week , Trades can not be said to be in one direction , as said above in previous post sometimes it takes out low and sometime high and decide weekly direction, that is why On Monday most of the signals are @ pending sell .... and @ pending buy .. in such type of signals one side hitting SL is compulsory reason you are entering two sided signals but loss is small and profit taking trade is big

example this nzdjpy chart will clear what I mean to say :

Price Action: EuroJpy too slow,

GbpJpy and GbpUsd and EuroGbp all these three pair will show movements simultaneously.

No further update in any pairs till target aren't hit in eurojpy , gbpusd , Just concession to Usd , reason currency belongs to US, & @DonaldTrump is Mr President

One thing is quite clear in my mind , no chart no methodology will work , USD will remain stronger as long as @DonaldTrump is Mr President.

This man can not tolerate his currency to be weak otherwise EuroUsd should have been trading above 1.3028 as on date and time

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I bought eurogbp and will close it at .8722my SL .8614

GbpUsd: It Signal not analysis repeat again signal not analysis buy @1.2948 Stop loss .... TP 1.2963 if crossed 1.3018

Behind Every Successful Trader Is An Honest Broker

Behind Every unsuccessful Trader Is A Cheater Broker Broker,

EuroJpy chart has been deleted because it was costly chart posted by mistake

--- 帖子 #559 ---
If you are fed up of cheat broker , choose a broker who accept PayPal, before cheating you he will have to think thousands times, by the Chance Indians are not allowed by any broker through PayPal

I have not seen any National Bank or payment processor better than or near to PayPal since 2005 I came in online business.

I have no problem in buying GbpUsd : but only if it touch 1.2981

Sometimes we make mistake i.e. ok it will do , but blunder mistake than we have to suffer.

Now what is mistake ? and what is blunder mistake?

Answer is GbpUsd: you must read above post when and at what time what I said.

Now again mistake is selling GbpUsd and Blunder mistake is not Buying GbpUsd.

Keep SL permanent 1.2906 and keep on buying till it reaches 1.3245. When this pair dip down it means you have found a gold mine when dip down buy with more force

Real Target lies above 1.3310 for very safety, I say 1.3245.  Now this pair is not going to look back just retrace and immediately run like Japanese Bullet Train.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Above 1289.00 Gold is long TP 1298 or 1302 SL 1276.00

EuroJpy better avoid for today

EuroUsd: forget about sell it will dip one swing and than up again dont sell that swing , just buy that swing could be in range between 1162-1188. Reason pair is going towards and above 1.1318 minimum it has not even touched 1.1224 wchich i call a pending target

For GbpUsd to be a valid trend change 1.2943 should not be touch otherwise chart require to be reconsidered, first station for gbpusd seems to be at 1.3068

OK if you want to sell eurousd than sell @ 1.1230 TP 1.1192 but wait exact point is 1.1242 for selling target will be same at 1.1192

Important update on GbpUsd:  Just came to know there could be a trend change in this pair at a larger degree which can lead it to above 1.3500 but for that confirmation we have to wait for week it is just for your information to be cautious

To be Frank Trading is real tough business.  Not in the sense that it can not be done . Tough in the sense , learning ,charting and than updating charts with the move

every time frame have to be looked for time to time sometimes indicators have to be used , than you have to be specialized in your own pattern , your main pattern ,

you must have knowledge of nearly every thing available , you have to be flexible , acceptable attitude and much more more over discipline of trading and money management is first and foremost thing .

Once you will do , you will feel proud of yourself but not egoistic , market don't like egoistic and angry and attacking attitude.

But 100% success is there ,waiting for you .  For beginners my lovely recommendation is never start with more than $50 and restrict with 0.01 lot with fixed SL 50 pips

Take it as playfulness & win will be waiting for you.  Whenever market does not move read and analysis but do not enter market without proper entry , without knowing that what the objective is , Always keep in mind either SL or TP no interference in between never manage once entered .

& WIN is sure 100% guaranteed.  But perfection is not in this business.

Thanks and regards for every Trader here on this Thread .  Wait for beautiful opportunity coming in Jpy pairs may take 1 day or 2 or even this week

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Latest update on GbpUsd: This Pair is on fire now taking out 1.3050 will set next objective @ 1.3095 than expect a pull back to 1.3001 minimum .

but only if it takes out 1.3050, what I have seen about this pair in chart is being proved by its movement , as soon as I will see any new change will also update

EuroJpy buy @ 124.96 TP1 126.78 TP2 133.12 SL 123.65

GbpJpy, NzdJpy, CadJpy entered buy trend but Gbpjpy will retrace after some move rest is ok trade accordingly just for your information I have indicated long term trend which will last for months

EuroUsd: by the end of todays candle a dip should go below 1.11756 if market does not go there at least a spike should be seen below that level to complete my PA

The latest BIS’s Triennial Central Bank Survey released last September reported the FOREX market has an average daily volume of $6.6 Trillion…
$6.6 Trillion!!!

That’s almost a 30% increase over the 2015 Survey that reported $5.1 Trillion…

And 473% more than the $1.18 Trillion reported in 1995, just prior to the opening of the Retail Market (eRetail) in 1997.

(The growth in the futures, options, and stock markets have also been incredible over the last two decades.)

Forex Market Nowadays has a quite different type of motion. And this will avoid all previous theory. Every where there is advertisements found made this much of money

but that is not true and rare makes money . Let me tell you one thing , it as become more of a philosophical than a mechanical or technical .

I found that resistance is having more effect when perpendicular 2nd when a currency is in motion it is not .786 or .886 % retracement nor it is a five or three waves, in a down trend it goes on making new  lower lows and in uptrend it goes on making a newer high.

psychology is clear a loser hold his position for longer than the winner. In such situation I am uploading a beautiful tool it is combination of two tools more effective than any other theory.

In this tool your win will start from 1st loosing , here is tool

use both at a time on single chart of just 15 minutes no more than 15 minute chart

This will be last mistake for sellers to correct and amend their trade Euro Usd is headed towards 1.3200.

Sunday -Monday -Tuesday days passes slowly slowly and you will not know when it has accelerated towards big move

I will post detailed story when I have time to type but dont expect this or next week to fall below 1.0988.

wait .....

OK in short note it printing above 1.1039 will confirm a move up to 1.1174 or could be much more

if fails to print above 1.1039 than to down wards it is supported by many support where ever you see double close expect a big move up

double close near the same level is much more valuable bearish double close and than a bullish up close up move is certain see now at 1H candle in EuroUsd

It is not sure that retracement will end at 1.1054 it can be deeper and can lead to as deep as 1.1018 but next safe entry is applicable once the high is taken out

In trading you should plan your own strategy , listening to other opinions disastrous.

on my opinion, you  have no basis for deciding when to get out of the trade.

Finally, by surrendering the decision

process of the trade to another person, you have no method for risk control.

But someone others charts can give you clue and understanding to further strengthen your opinion

Fake move and  Trap does not exists in Forex/Trading behind every single pip there is money put or withdrawal from the market.

So Fake move and Trap saying is ignorance when you cannot reason a move or understand it simply say Fake move & Trap.

90% of the people jumps in this Industry without knowing it, just they think they will click on sell or buy button and earn money and purchase a new Rolls Royce Car

and a big bungalow on a beautiful land or could be reason of advertisements of some brokers.

let me tell you the science and Technic behind this move ,

market will break out of this consolidation go up equidistant than will be pulled back and finally released from the pull back for up move

market is always advancing or declining under two strong forces . the equilibrium forces create consolidations than again a fight again those forces once one force get advantage of other force the suppressed force will not be able to get control back that is what we call trend example in GbpUsd Now almost no way to for making new low unless some heavy news that might not be able to break the lowest low 1.1958

From the book : THE NEW MARKET WIZARDS

CONVERSATIONS WITH

AMERICA'S TOP TRADERS

JACK D. SCHWAGER

It's not whether you're right or

wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when

you're wrong. The few times that Soros has ever criticized me was when I was really right on a market and

didn't maximize the opportunity.

As an example, shortly after I had started working for Soros, I was very bearish on the dollar and put on a

large short position against the Deutsche mark. The position had started going in my favor, and I felt rather

proud of myself. Soros came into my office, and we talked about the trade.

"How big a position do you have?" he asked.

"One billion dollars," I answered.

"You call that a position?" he said dismissingly. He encouraged me to double my position. I did, and the

trade went dramatically further in our favor.

Soros has taught me that when you have tremendous conviction on a trade, you have to go for the

jugular. It takes courage to be a pig. It takes courage to ride a profit with huge leverage. As far as Soros is

concerned, when you're right on something, you can't own enough.

It is often difficult to predict the next move in dynamic Market. But when market is closed or on off line chart every one is scholar & Albert Einstein in dictating support and resistance , wave analysis , or any other pattern that exists in this theory.
But honesty after executing a trade no one knows whether market will be in your favor or against you.
It is just a probability 50-50 chance .
A 30 Pips fixed SL is the best ides with trailing stop 5 pips. If your trade is against you are stopped out if in favor you make money.
This formula need to be experimented for long run on your strategy . I mean your strategy +this formula

EuroUsd: Stop loss for Sell 1.1134

Stop Loss for buy 1.1042

GbpUsd: SL 1.3170  hit

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hi Friends

This week due to heavy volatility expected in Gbp. Euro Usd pairs.  So short range signals likely to hit SL levels more often.

As seen yesterday in GbpUsd pair.

But here is one more and other option in Euro Gbp : You can understand with this chart signal .

This yellow and magenta bar signal rarely fails Targeting 100 pips with over all signal is bullish adjust your SL and TP accordingly

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Are you satisfied with signals or not ?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Signal deleted for security reason.   I don't want to advertise signal for crowd only for  few friend

But dont take half profit let the market hit either TP or SL

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Don't be worried about EuroUsd Target @ 1.1175 is confirmed but my target 1.1362 need to hold

Watching Gbp Usd will post on confirmation

Euro Jpy Solid target @ 121.40 SL 120.35

Gbp Usd Solid sell @ 1.3284-1.3323 TP 1.2800 SL shud be 50-60 pips less spread

But gbpusd must reach 1.3284

After analyzing several Charts my conclusion is to stop posting Signals for at least till next week  let the markets settle down .

This political huss fuss may cause random movement which can bring heavy looses and huge profit but that is not my game that is suitable for gamblers which I am not I trade technically.

Your views are required on crude oil .  both fundamental and technical

EuroCad : buy confirmed by triple bearish  divergence of crude oil & euro strength

Jpy Vs all pairs on hold though usdjpy chart signals deeper sell

--- 帖子 #658 ---
if eurousd do not cross 1.1196 a small correction down to 1.1142-1.1153 can take place

a small correction of 20-25 pips shud be considering over bought for further advance

EuroUsd: Think of it as target situated at 1.1329 minimum where a standard pullback can be expected real target is still much above ,

now small pull back is good entry for holding buy for a said target , it is also possible two days passes within 25 pips up and down

--- 帖子 #661 ---
So, would you please tell whether it works for Scalpers or what?

Friends as war has erupted in middle east region. Expect unexpected moves in currencies and oil .

But there is still in future which will change war but trading still will follow its Charts but not in short term on long terms.

So last weak Signals succeeded , but with the opening of new weak we have to wait and watch .  How this war will effect our trading charts.

For trading patience and coolness is our formula.

I do not read news but on friday crude oil jumps above 63 and EuroUsd reversed I was travelling in bus .  Than someone told me about war immediately charts images struck in m mind and  i realized sudden change was due to war any way it was good opportunity for EU bears to close their short on minimum loss

Recently calculated with fresh view , it seems as EuroUsd should take out 1.1173 as no evidence to calculated for downward motion only break of 1.1085 can change this out look

it was GbpUsd my bad type mistake

--- 帖子 #695 ---
As today is Saturday, some time is needed to make some chart setup only if you have not made consistent profit previous week.

it will be better to wait and market to hit lower target .

EuroUsd & GbpUsd both are destined for down target  for Euro Usd and GbpUsd again the long term on weekly target remains bullish but on daily

EU may go 100-125 Pips (Price interest Point).

Direction change can be confirmed with a set of above uploaded indicators and tpl in a single chart .

Eurousdpossible target for wave D lies at 1.1156 before it start down for wave e

possible target for gold wave e  is up at 1588 before it start for down acceleration

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Gold touching 1568 will hint a buy point above 1608

near 1633 or could lead to 1666 it could be ending point of wave 5 on weekly and daily bases

properly the last down wave c is yet not complete if it complete it than too a=c target lies at 1536 but than it should not touch 1568

2nd chart is gold weekly

--- 帖子 #700 ---
EuroUsd updated :

Market with yellow lines are a b and c lines a complete b complete as running flat c is missing where as minimum requirement is a=c could lead to 1.161 % of a

so in my view down move not accepted yellow lines should be completed at = or 1,161 target

chart attached

--- 帖子 #701 ---
For long term trader: A long reversal is due in eurousd , it shud not go far below current level any time we shud see reversal probably today or tomorrow

for new entry SL 1.0745 TP minimum 1.1420 to 1.2100 as per my wave count may be wrong

Any how blue C shud be = blue A

EuroUsd: Now is the time to capture every pip multiple times in buy mode . Market will feel upside jerks and pressure .

Every new low point can be bought at first  touch this game can be kept on playing

This pair is in strong downtrend.

How can we buy and make profit if it keeps going down?

it will blow up your account if there is no reversal.

just my simple toughts.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
yes no doubt in strong down trend agree with you 100%

but trend in never forever , there has to be some saturation point where market reverse and trend change .

That is what EW theory is for . EW predicts turning point . Not to convince you but for understanding a prediction of wave cycle

--- 帖子 #705 ---
At first,  I also traded with only one pair. Yes, it is very slow process but it ensures profit slowly but consistently. It has also low risk.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Gold sell @ 1688.00 TP 1511 SL no need to place just hold for this leg nothing better than this trade just you need to hold the position.

But to get most out of this trade hold this position till it hit your TP level than once TP level is hit

again sell @ 1630-1142 SL 1680 and hold for three month

you have to search for money where is money , now my microscope see in audjpy monthly reversal is due and A leg will start just like eurousd and gbpusd on monthly basis so you have to hold for 100-150 pips once reversal start you will not be able to catch the trend it will be so rapid and fast

see monthly chart here

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Aud/Jpy: As per regression channel it should start reversing from near to 65.50 or 66.50 . as it is calulated on monthly chart that reversal is due

use your on mind and regression channel to enter the trade.

Just a idea that pair has money for you

No it is wave E of triangle pattern  if it is not wave E than too only weekly chart it is will complete wave 1 than wave A of 2 is upside but will need to hold or wait to see if it goes 80-100 more down side

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Euro/Usd: Chart is here No doubt downward trend is complete but wave 2 of down ward is still due best wait for it to complete and than place buy w/o worry

in trading to make money you have to enter the market at the peak for reversal so you can earn the maximum . market will take nearly two to three weeks or probably

more to complete wave 2 . You will never know when the forceful wave will slip . wave can be predicted but time can not be predicted but estimated

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Gold minimum target is 1562.00 any time it will spike  to it  think t as a magical magnetic point w/o worrying for up move .

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Wave  of E of a triangle should decline

toward but not below 0.9188

so this count is viable and it calls for a more significant  taking out 0.9188 calls US Dollar weakness which is likely scenario as per EuroUsd and $index chart

though I have just blown my account   , just go and check EURO ,GBP,USD, NZD, AUD JPY PAIRS You will see one side move not less than 1000, so expect the same more than 500 pips retracement as I see in all pairs .

As you guys have seen move from 1.0771 to 1.1496 is and from 1.1496 to 1.0649 both are fast move

but now from 1.0771 to 1.1496 or some what less than it will be seen again  but hope fully market will travel upside with very slow race

let us see what happens

I became greedy and increased the lot size five time in counter trend in EuroGbp bbut as per my calculation I was not wrong if EU start rising from this level to 1.1496 but should not cross 1.1496 shud be 30 to 40 pips less than 1,1496

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Keep in mind that coming move from 1.0649 to 1.1445 0r 1.1460 will be very very power full but speed will be boring  market must reach toward 1.1400 this post will remain here as proof

EU: at a critical juncture I want it to hold from pull back just remember a powerful swing in the upward direction is waiting but only after retracement  (good retracement ) in this move if resistance is not offered by 1.1242 it should be offered and consolidated at 1.1293.

But danger is it could be a nice bear trap,  So new entry recommended only after pull back , sooner or later its reaching point above 1.1400 is undeniable that is confirmed,  but I wud like to say no early entry

On Saturday and Sunday I developed a system . So EuroUsd Trades will be posted based on this system .

The system comprises of , RSI , Pivots , MA, sto, Macd, Swings , sup & res.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
The beauty of this system is 1st I will calculate trend direction manual than supported by this system trade will be executed.

A loss indicated by system will be genuine SL point .

Let us see  the result

--- 帖子 #794 ---
I feel extremely curious to know your new system!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
EU : sell generated but I will not post signal on Monday

--- 帖子 #796 ---
OK, thank you!

--- 帖子 #797 ---
EU : Where is buy and where is sell points ?

1st  Trading system is silent and in consolidating zone so no new entry at this point new entry is just like gambling

2nd  Manual analysis reveal some what down for Euro Usd but this down should be just a bear trap because $Index has to go down so I expect one more bounce for Euro Usd from 1.0928 zone

It is also possible today after crossing pivot zone it bounce strongly to the upside

But at this stage no indication from system and system can not be forced

--- 帖子 #798 ---
GREAT to hear from you!

You are completely right: Systems should not be forced. Patience is a MUST in trading.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Please Note that the Signals posted here are a probability based on certain strategy .

But note that I can not control the Market nor market is under me that I can lead it wherever I want .

If it would have been so I would not have here.  I my self is struggling to make money

It is your own mind where to reserve your profit if market goes in my signals favor

Good morning, satish37.

What do you mean by "fabricated"? I know the meaning of fabricated but I do not understand well what you want to say...

By the way, I have not yet bought eurusd.

Thanks.

Jos

--- 帖子 #804 ---
It was mean to be equidistant for both buyer and sellers either 3rd down side or third upside

--- 帖子 #805 ---
logically EU shud not cross the 1.0615 up ward cycle is incomplete but if it cross down target will shift much down

I still dont believe much down but market is market

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Not recently but some ago I saw a bug in weekly & monthly charts .  on that base it does not allow me to believe think wrong

Because it is said in any strategy you can not ignore its rules

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Any How a touch of 1.0926 will put my thinking on front foot but till than market is really in down pressure

EU:-

There are certain point where markets will hit in this random motion , keeping this in mind you can aim minimum target @1.1019.

1.0887 is SL point for upward move

--- 帖子 #824 ---
EU: -

After crossing 1.0924 just aim for 1.1128

if the pair is reflected back from 1.0919 it is ok

but always emphasize on Buy trades. becoz movementum is on upside.

you can use momentum RSI only on TF 15 mnt and 30 mnt

here is your movementum RSI :

Chart remved as it is  private counting system  and costly item

--- 帖子 #836 ---
as mentioned above break of 1.0726 is needed and should pave the way for a new low

--- 帖子 #837 ---

@satish37

Please do you have this kind of Elliot Wave Indicator that does not repaint for MT4?  Please share if you have.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #844 ---
I am busy in some other task .  Yes the indicator was uploaded in previous post. You check you will find it there .

Trading need to analyze with concentrate .  I am not in position now to give time on analyze .

Euro Usd : is on a special juncture where every upward break will open new door for up move , but as it moves up unless it break 1.1167 risk of down can not be eliminated. below 1.0870 it will be in down trend towards 1.0500 handle . we need to break 1.1496 to eliminate down move .

Break of 1.1167 is main subject .

though strike towards 1.1100 handle cannot be denied today and it should be broken as market is in strong force towards upwards direction .

but if what i see is true than 1.1100 should be broken today if not than resistance is definitely stronger .

Post will not be regular to day I got time from other paper work

thanks for reading

with good strategy not only on but combining three or two strategy , a funded account of $ 3000/- should bring you consistent income of 300$/- per month .

only two things are requirement one is money management , 2nd is strategy you adopt .

--- 帖子 #874 ---
This loosing trade was my mistake of too early prediction .

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Swing size and movement of market you will find he same in all currency pairs nearly the same pattern .

This I call market rhythmic history .

example aud usd

eurojpy , euro usd , usdjpy

compare you will under stand

not exactly the same  , it means new expectation for reversal .

--- 帖子 #876 ---
that's 10% month

pretty good

well done

--- 帖子 #877 ---
This pair will bring a nice opportunity for 400 pips but I will exact the right entry on this pair possible it may  take two weeks to be ready

--- 帖子 #878 ---
yes that seems nice , but good strategy and money management  , 50 pips loss means next trade must bring +ve result  with required target .

what I said in  that case on that amount maximum lot size not exceed 0.06 in any case . Trade should be aligned with two strategy , loss should be limited on swing base with moving method as above chart shown above reflecting moving average and swing .

in this case risk /reward is 1:1  but as per our target we aim at 1: 5 .

why 1: 5 because a advancing or impulsive swing is 5 times .

2nd at a stage out of 0.06,  0.04 profit is taken out , we advance with without risk

This much work is required to get 10% per month . That you can not rely on any other person in the world unless you learn yourself .

your own learning & understanding is must , than only you can search for a good and best setup .

Three small loses are not so dangerous than a single trade against a trending market .

Most of the traders loose money, yes it is true .

Where is the clue to remain protected always and forever in this type of market ?

The the clue is in your mind it is all the mind Technic to remain protected and profitable .

Rule is :-

1st keep first and foremost money management alaways have ten thousand pips security for a particular trade and lot size,  on a particular pair never open more than two position gapping one thousand pips.

2nd Use strategy you have mastered , could be  any.

3rd Always have expert analyst on your side by subscribing to their signal services,  which plays very very importat role to protect your 100 of thousand $ account

This may cost you $200 pm but will always keep your account safe and growing.

Never try to cross vast Ocean Alone and without safety tool/equipment

One idea came to my mind , when people can easily double triple or multiply their account ten times in a day in demo competition , why cant it be done in a month with safety .

it will be little bit risky , but this week , and next week only solid signals aligned with indicators, trend lines ,pivots and rsi will be posted.

either $1000 loss or $ 3000-4000 profit .

no trade will be executed with more than lot 0.1 lot size .

only in 2nd week after gaining profit we will execute standard lot it may also take 4th week .

I will also use some personal indicators

--- 帖子 #925 ---
I will post some combination of indicators essential whether use or not but must be on chart .   Before we dive in this self-competition

--- 帖子 #926 ---
One of the most important thing is , No one is going to pay you from their pocket or home , it is the money of buyers and sellers the whole game is nothing more than + & - . The structure of market is getting complex day in & day out .

I was student of religious psychology , your faith and trust is needed by every one , unless you have faith & trust in any one you can not be deceived,

yes it is true w/o faith and trust it is almost difficult to survive .

Hi Satish37,

I have just subscribed to this channel. I have one request for you-could you give me a set of indicators that is good for 4HR Time frame for Currency with a template? I am making this request because I can see that you have a lot of indicators but  I am finding it difficult to put all together.

Many thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #953 ---
It is by chance that you asked about it , the same thing I have been thinking to upload .

But I am most concerned with is at least 15 to 20 Pips signals should be solid and 95% win ration with the Template , I am composing here .

I have composed the template , Image of tpl is uploaded in the next section indicators will be uploaded with explanation

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Will write how to use after sometime.

1. Crossing of super scalper indicator & super trend indicatores is must and compulsory .

2. Pandorum indicator , which is vey high solid in itself must give same signal as by above 1.

3. Signal generated should be fresh by Trend Chart 2.

4. Sell signal should not be taken (executed) near the lower boundary of automatic regression channel, and buy signal should not be executed near the top boundary of automatic regression channel.

5. Trend Lord and elderss market termometer are used to give early indications of trend reversal , most probably for getting out of trade .

Some guys prefer their predetermined options , they have nothing to do with technical or fundamentals .

They are habitual sellers or buyers.  In this Industry Forex their is way for them too , the formulla is simple markets 1st takes 75% from you & after some time it return you 61.8 %.

Habitual buyers may get EU: upto 1.1692-1.1710  but finally

Habitual sellers must get their target hit @ 1.1510 (+-)

EAs

--- 帖子 #983 ---
A simple strategy to make money. take 10-12 EA free version collected from here and there but should be working EAs example EAs downloaded from FXCracked.Com put all EAs on different charts on MT4/MT5 . Now have a cent account minimum funded $40/ 4000 USC . Your mind & emotions will not be involved and over all you will make money probably double account in 30 or 45 days or may be 60 days you can try it in your demo account . But EAs should be reliable. Useless EA wont do anything .
I had posted many EAs check them if working try /experiment on demo you wont regret

If you have $3000/$4000 in your demo account try EA Leprechaun uploaded here below on Gold and silver kept running for 1 week check result

EuroUsd : A break of 1.2058 may mean wave iii down has started & a minimum target @ 1.1972 otherwise upward potentials remain open towards tgt 1.2202/ 1.2223-1.2237/ 1.2278-1.2287 area.

Gold: gold will 1st rally to $1892-$1903. [Silver]’s rally pushed to $30.01 today. Now Gold count shows price toward the $1630-$1670 range. But Gold likely to follow silver in the upward direction any how gold 1st tgt 1892

Something that should be always in mind while trading and looking at charts. Later I will tell you the secret of spread, swap , trades ,traders not making money and how you make broker extra rich

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Can you elaborate a bit on this?  If one EA is bad wouldn't he bring the whole account down?

There's more chance that 1 EA is bad than having 12 good ones.

Let me know if I understand you correctly

--- 帖子 #986 ---
I performed this practical on demo account for more than two weeks , yes there will be loosing trades not only one but many, but account will not be damaged over all they will be stopped out at certain level.  you simply have to note that all EAs place   SL either hidden or visible.  1st perform it on demo than you will get clue and get 30-40% growth.

something should be noted you should be running VPS .

There’s no such thing as the perfect expert. There’s better ones than others, but at the end of the day they all wipe out your account if you don’t intervene manually.

Brother Spacca, I am not here to discourage or encourage any trader, I am here trading myself and if I could help someone .

you are not wrong there are many garbage also on the net , than what does it mean filter, filter the diamonds from garbage .

If you know how to use you can make money . same item used by two different persons one makes other losses.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
I think Exness should be ok reason two.  one it pays direct in your bank , minimum w/d is $15 , w/d is fast . sometimes some problems too but that will be solved soon.

it proves cent account as well as ECN and mini accounts . $ 5000 for mini account .  and $ 150 for cent account should be enough.

Play with cent account stay sideway do not interrupt EAs work let it do it self .

Either win/ loss formula.  I will not recommend mini /ecn account

only cent account if you trades Gold and Silver

Please follow your own consciousness, I am not suggesting but giving idea

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
No idea about it, but will say , Black Diamond , WallStreetRecoveryPro, North East Way EA and Blessing EA, should be used for currency trading. Along with LeprechaunEA.

Do not increase lot size, adjust and fix lot multiplier.

Keep a track of over all equity DD at a certain level if it increase that level Stop manually for example 10% ,20$ 25% of total equity .

Than Stop that Day or that week and restart next week , it should definitely make gains recovering past lossees.

I have done practical , it is only quality of EA to multiply accounts within months. Negative phase is as manuall trading has DD. EAs DD is much more higher than manual trading.

Use your mind when to interrupt EA . It is most difficult task to decide the point of interruption. As wrong interruption will stop EAs recovery and gains that is what i say your own clue

BtcUsd : Divergence seen in RSI & MACD . This means next target for BTCUSD @ 41000 minimum could be start of downfall. Remember one thing Bitcoin is Hollywood type lifestyle will not last long crash any time.  It is virtual coin . No computer no digital you can not keep this type of wealth in your home just like other wealth real estate or Precious Metals or Your regional coins of $.

It is all virtual imaginary , remember one thing this type of technology wealth or science is always short term ,  The game is to make fools of crowd of world at large.

Temp user would have become billionaires by now.  Few people might have read my post when  i had declared btcusd target from $3400 -  $35000  Last year .

1.Skrill is the only option for me for Forex. Exness has Skrill's option too. A few years ago they held my money without any reason. Then when I wrote against them over the net, then they paid me. Are you using them for trading?

2. I think Gold can't be traded with any cent account. Anyway, is it possible?

3. What's your opinion regarding FXTM, Alpari, and FBS? They all have cent account.

4. I have tried Lepre and I am impressed with it.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
1. Yes I use Exness for trading, I am not a big amount traders , I occasionally(rarely) have funded above $1000-/ , Average $ normal funding is $100-/ that too sometimes in three or four months. My concept of trading is 1st and foremost any how not to loose.

2. Yes Gold can be traded in cent account in Exness but bitcoin and oil can not be .

3. FXTM, Alpari, and FBS , No experience of these brokers

4. Lepre yes tried best .

One of the reason not funded with nice amount is swap , problems with brokers , as the forex is Ban in my country. So no legal support from Gov in case of problem with deposit amount. I already am in loss of more than $100/- withdrawal done but not recd in my bank since three years .

IMO unless you have Govt or legal power in your favor risking your capital with unknown institution or firm is not a good idea.

I am trading since last 12 yrs with tools and strategies. Except time I have not waisted or lost money in this business.

I could not find job , I tried than as a last option I accepted forex as my source of income now at this stage of life (62yrs) I am thinking of earning unfortunately it is Ban business here.

Nearly one year ago I said BTCUSD buy & hold , only way to make good income.  Now again  time has not come yet for entry but market conditions are getting ready .

BTCUSD 39000 should be a good buy spot but not before it . There are scopes BTCUSD to fall to the point below 15000. even could lead to much lower. but taking out 39000 will void down trend .

As on date it is at a very critical juncture.  The negative aspect is , it is new type of Trading so fast so quick .  The way it can make reach =  The way it can bring investor on road.

for a intelligent people it is enough to understand a 0.09$ coin trading @35000.

Currencies are guaranteed never will  be zero .

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Either my English is weak or your . The same way when BTCUSD was trading @3450 $ & I said for a buy Signal, was response .

clearly my indication was buy above 39000  and it means sell below 32000.  where is DD much higher I dont understand.  I dont have myfxbook.

there is no question of multiplier  martingle etc  , simple it is a sell signal below 32000  and buy above 39000.

even i dont understand what is benefit of myfxbook, what is it ? You mention it I will waste 4-5 minutes what is it . I dont know how much multiplier how many but I know I have not given any penny from my pocket to this market . Yes , I have given time a valuable time to study it & impart my knowledge about market to my students who too have not given a single penny to the market .  I am not worried about any expert I know about my trading style and that is worth earning a living and I am earning who care for expert etc myfxbook or hisfxbook.

One thing should be clear about Bitcoin.  What is it?  What Satoshi Nakamoto has created.  I am not going deep into theory .
In simple language of trading History , it is a bubble a Mania. No doubt a bubble is beautiful exciting but its life is seconds long.

A assumption block chain theory only related to digital transaction, has no guarantee. you can have currencies or metals in your pocket btc is only a digital or virtual asset . It is the only assumed asset w/o guarantee to bring any big or huge investor to bring them on the road side within no time.

One and only one formula in this world is only a deception to the trust . if you avoid Trust ,  You will never be deceived you will never be harmed.

Consider it a Universal formula.  Which will never expire with time. it is mathematic of life .

My statement should not be considered as negative it is a Alert .  BTC can Lure you to $400000.  But than all of sudden within a week it can be 10 for a $.

It will not give chance for survival if it is your govt bond than ok

OK enough of BTC Talk. Now currencies. Best for the Next week opportunity are , Crude Oil, a good target of 1000 Pips or more keep hold $74-$75 should not cross.

GbpUsd should be a triangular movement if not support @ 1.4062 should and resistance at 1.4249 should hold . currently market @ 1.4114 a good sell spot is 1.4168 with SL @ 1.4249 and a buy spot @ 1.4124 with SL 1.4062.

Usd Cad is risk free buy target @ 12210 SL 1.2123

Euro Usd Sell @ Current Market Price with SL 1.2133 Target @ 1.2062/1.2034

EuroJpy : Sell @ 133.62-133.92 than hold for a target of 129.70/128.47 focus on selling

EuroUsd: To make money you have to hold the buy trade, my broker is offering swap free instant withdrawal to any processor . Why hold EU? Contracting triangle type formation is forming but you can profit both from down as well as up move Up move has a very long range if you leg in this move or fall against this move you may suffer huge loss for longer time period . In short move no problem just need to hold for months or two month scalping shud always be in favor of long term trend.

GbpUsd: minimum target 1.3402

EuroChf: target towards 1.1212 but buy only when divergence in RSI seen

This is a very rare setup taking place at the moment in EuroUsd . If not in once a life time than it is also not less than once a 5-8 yrs setup seen rarely in any market.

contracting type triangle

1st triangle is bigger

2nd triangle is smaller

3rd triangle is quite small , now the breakout will take place either from the upper end or from the lower end. You have very clear SL & TP with huge Risk/Reward Ration

Market is so much unpredictable that even professional analyst can not predict it with confidence. After taking out LL. wave is complete & can revert to minimum

1.1381 which is requirement even if to continue down side other scenario is market may complete exact target which is dotted magenta line at 1.0982 & than we can expect a trend reversal or a minimum correction to 1.1382

So now is the exact one entry for buy order .

2nd if price comes below 1.1182 we have chance for one more buy entry .

3rd if price come under 1.1000 we have third buy grid entry for all buy order to hit the given target @ 1.1381

That is how a profitable trades should be executed to cover up losses and make profit.

This is Not my advice but view you may like or not. I am posting it as my habit or hobby .

Below charts are some i had from some professional articles one in black background are my own .

But for those who cant see big loss & want small loss small TP can use be low mention two indicators of MA and one EA based on MA (adjustable)

but executed order should be in the direction of main FXTT indicator (Main Point)

t is not & never possible to make money in a day while trading any market.  If you do not know how the mind of Market Makers and Hedge Fund manager woeks . Here is simple steps :

Yen was announces weak against USD nearly a year ago .  Yen was said to be weak against Euro , it took year or probably year and a half to see the result.

So meaning of saying is to make good money one must hold position for more tha a year with proper lot size managing equity using formulla for money management

below are some trades .

See two charts of XAU/USD  & USD/JPY  holdin tsese two trades for long term can bring very good results probably more than year

EurChf: has already entered a buy zone Target 1.0668 must or in simple language cumpulsory be hit .

It is better to trade this pair with small lot but hold position , in my count down side count is complete so if still it has to go down than too wave two target is much upper side.

considering usdchf eurochd gbpusd usdcad $index

Any time Euro should be stronger if not for longer  time it must be a short time stronger . EuroUsd pair , in my count down side count is complete so if still it has to go down than too wave two target is much upper side.

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
EuroUsd: Nothing to worry , 1st 1.0340 should not be broken, any how if broken we should buy extra 2 lots. Assuming 1 lot buy already holding

EuroCHF: SL 1.0515 TP .9994  Remember if 1.0515 is broken than long buy for a target 1.0930 The base of this trade is as attached image

From my email:- as received, posting as it is important for traders

The mainstream admits they missed it entirely.

"FedEx Earnings' Miss and Guidance Revision BLINDSIDE Analysts"

Being blindsided is their modus operandi. Remember that little blip in 2008-2009, aka The Great Recession? They didn't see that coming, either.

Now it's 2022, and nothing has changed.

Inflation?

"Fed Chairs Powell and Yellen Admit: We Didn't See It Coming"

Back-to-back quarters of negative GDP?

"White House Sees No Recession on Horizon; Seeks to Change Definition"

Remember this classic?

"Interest Rates Will Be at Zero for the Foreseeable Future"

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me six times? It's time to change horses.

STOP LISTENING to these people.

THEY will never change, but YOU can.

Not trading with any indicator or any EA.  Just waves and single Moving average

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Making money in Forex is not a problem. Need patience to hold a position .  Another important point is before you become a good trader by that time you have made a huge loss.  Now in your trading you will be aiming for recovery not profit.

For recovery and profit you have to wait for a particular point market to reach than enter a trade and hold that trade for a particular target.  Most of the traders thinks in the gambling style , just after executing a trade it should hit target in 5 minute spam of time which is never possible.

Here you will receive trend direction and target points for market so you can make very good profit. I can impart training for deserving trader free but you have to prepare for reading moving average direction and angle and few candle stick patterns at your own.

Example : here is no problem for EuroUsd hitting just above 1.0805 it does not require to know which direction market has to go. Whether market go Down or Up but 1.0805 must be hit

EuroUsd: Sometimes combinations of MA are very useful in predicting future price of a instrument here is my chart with three touch and two touch support and resistance lines where MA 50 and MA 20 pointing up MA 14 pointing down but market closed above MA 14 .

So as said above TP 1 should not be objected , let us see what happen

Trade with proper plan and proper management Happy Trading for the coming week

For risk to reward ratio SL can be place @ 1.0585

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
