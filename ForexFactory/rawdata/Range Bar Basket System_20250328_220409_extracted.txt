I go to show a simple system for Basket trading. I am using actually for Basket V.6. It works and could be profitable in short term. If you don’t know how install the indicator you can read the thread created by Kosmolate. I thank his efforts and contribution. First all we must be determine the trend. We can use whatever you want for it, HA, EMA, Ichimoku, etc. I use 21 EMA and Ichimoku (5,10,20). When a Bar close above Ichimoku trend is UP and we only put Buy orders. When a Bar close below Ichimoku trend is DOWN and we only put Sell orders. Now we go to look to a special 1h bar. I call it Range Bar. Its simple, look at a bar that engulf following bars inside its range. Draw two lines at low and high of this bar. In an UP trend: When price touch drawed line of Low Range Bar enter a Buy position. In a DOWN trend: When price touch drawed line of High Range Bar enter a Sell position. Close partial position at target 1 (other line of range). Close rest when a bar close below/above Ichimoku with strong or a fixed 1000, 1500…. pips. All depend of your MM. And thats all. Simple. See the chart attached please. Apologize my English please. All the best. Regards.

Jaquemate, Could you clearly define "range bar"? In your 2nd pic, your so called "range bar" was just a large bar. It does not look like an engulfing candle, unless you meant engulfing of the following candle?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I thought am the only one that's confused. Can u clearly re-explain what u mean by range bar? Tell us more on how to identify it please

--- 帖子 #4 ---
i don't know what is Basket trading. can you explain it for me？

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for the question FxSwordfish. My problem is my limited English level. I hope you apologize. Ok, forget the word “engulf bar” please. When I say “Range Bar” I am talking about a bar what breakout a previous range of price and close out the range. When the bar closed most time following bars are oscillating within it creating a new range of price. Spikes of the following bars go out the range but no bar closed out. I hope you understand me. All the best. Regards.

Hi all: This is the trade of today. Buy @ 77.25. enter 2 lots, mini, micro. First lot close at target 80.25 (+300). No stop. Close position if a candle close below range support. Regards

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Ok target 1 achieve. +300 pips. Second position still open and BE (+330 now). You can see how new bar breakout the range. This bar can form a new range or not. If price reverse and touch support then enter a new 2 lots position at 78. Target 1 at 80.70 (+370). But if a bar close below 78 and close below clouds with strong it could be a new Down Trend. Almost for me. All the Best. Regards.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Well here we go. Price touch support at 78 and enter Buy 2 Lots. Regards.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Jaque, Thanks for showing your simple system. So simple I cannot understand it fully, sorry. Could you explain when you move your ranges please. I understand that when new close &gt; prev range high (buying) you use that new bar for the new range (1) BUT ... If the very next after that bar also closes above that new range (1) do you move that range up again (2) or just wait for a pullback of the first new range (1). What I mean is when do you disregard (1) and go on to look for (2) ?? M.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks for question futurespec. you are wellcome. See the chart attached please. I hope help you. All the best. Regards.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Why you call it basket trading system? And what time frame you usually trade this method? Maybe there is something I don`t understand, thanks.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Refer to this thread here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=391229 Jaquemate is showing you his way of trading basket

--- 帖子 #13 ---
We are in loss now. See the chart please.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks ckyon1: i forgot attached link. Wellcome. Regards.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
25 minutes of new bar and price dont break the cloud. Good signal. If this bar close below cloud i closed trade in loss.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks for response. Sorry again but still noyt totally got it ......... Looking at your rely post #10...... Range is set at 9. Assuming that buy point is NOT reached at 10. would you move the range up to the new bar that closes above 9. range at 5 bars later (and also again 1 bar later) or would you wait for a retrace to the buy point of 9. ?? Thanks, M.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi futurespec. thanks for question. If Buy point is not reached at 10 there is no Buy order and you must wait untill a bar close above the range. When it happen this new bar is a new bar range until the range is broken. Every bar what close above/below previous range is ever a range bar… And it happens all time, again and again. I don’t know if I explain it correctly. English limit my explanation capacity. Regards

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks Jaque Good explanation and your English is good enough.... it answers my question and I understand now. What is it that you are trading on those charts? What do you normally trade with this idea? Thanks again M.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi all: I closed yesterday open position in minimal loss. A bearish bar closed below previous RB and Ichimoku clouds forming a new RB. It could be the start of a bearish trend or only a pullback of bullish trend. Nobody knows. Only i can is follow the trend and enter position with small risk... and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
56 minutes ago i enter a Sell order at 79.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Bullish bar closed above RB. -40 pips loss. However i dont close position yet. I wait for retrace of next bar to previous high range.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Well. I closed Sell position at BE. attached todays statement. Todays could be a Range Day.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Now i waiting for enter a Buy order. See chart attached please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Jaquemate, Thanks for ur effort.Your system is working on 1H time frame.So will u look for large Time frames for SR?or blindly following 1H only?Post #23 leading kumo showing bearish trend but still u r looking for buys....

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Ok, im long now. Market is speed today. i dont like it.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi negi29. You are wellcome. Thanks for question and thanks for your words. For me all is relative. If you see the this basket buy order put at one crosses single chart what do you see?. Up trend?. Down trend?. Range?. I see a little range inside an Up trend. Could be turn at Down trend today or next Monday?. Can be. I don’t know. The most important thing of this system (and of all system I think) is minimize loss and let run profit. If i buy and a Down trend is starting there is no problem. I loss this position with -50 or -100 or BE at retrace. But if price go up my reward is almost +220 at first position and could be ilimited at second position. R.R??. Regards.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Closed buy position at retrace on BE. Today 3 trades. All closed at BE. Wait for another oportunity. Regards.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
If i had dont closed the first sell position opened today i would be in profit now. But i prefer minimize loss and wait for another oportunity. Regards.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Jacquemate, can you offer a template or at least the setting of your indicators? This system will surely work in trending markets. How are the results during sideways markets? How long are you trading this method?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Yes negi29. i look for large time frame for have and hindsight and look one single crosses to see exactly where i put the order. Regards.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi joker24. Indicators and settings are not important. Indicators are only a help. the Key is find a good system of entry and exit whats brind you a good R:R. You must minimize loss and let run profit. All trending system not works at sideways markets. Its obvious. But the important is minimize the loss at this time. If i closed the position always when range is broken then i only loss 40, 50 or 100 pips. If i wait for a retrace after breakout i close at BE most times. It not happens at every crosses but its happens most time in a Basket chart. Today is an example. 3 trades, all closed at BE. Where is the loss?. Today no loss at moment. If price go Down strong i loss an opportunity but i protect my capital and search for another opportunity. Thats all. No make things difficult. Forex is so simple. Not easy but so simple. Regards-

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I will attach indicator and template more late. Regards.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This is my hindsight now.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I attached templates and indicators. Basket V.6 for created basket chart. Ichimoku settings (5,10,20). I only interesting at clouds. Rest is no visible. 21 EMA help too. Regards.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
See a grafical example of how it works. Regards.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Graphical explanation helps a lot. To clarify .... You set a range the when you get a close outside that range you set a new range even if it is above or below previous range and even if you are in a sell or a buy mode.? At 12. you buy below the cloud ... is that because the range bar closed above? ... you still consider to be in an uptrend You are using the 'kos' chart to trigger a B/S and then entering a basket of trades ... all opened and closed at the same time? Thanks M.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi futurespec: See the chart please. It explain better. More late i explain how configure chart. Regards.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks again, another good explanation. What I had not considered was that you are trading a basket and, therefore, you was at that time still in profit. Keep up the good work. M.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Actual situation. Today is a range day.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Well closed Sell position at -145x2 = -290 pips of loss. Finally i dont wait for retrace cause bar was so strong and it could be a trend change. Today 4 trades: 3 BE 1 Loss. We are in an UP TREND. Regards.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
do you set minimum size for a candle to be a valid RB? Because if you don't, I think that the candles shown with blue arrows have closed higher than the previous range, so they must be considered the new RB, and the lower yellow line is the buy level, at first bounce. But I see that you ignored the yellow line, waited for a new RB that formed the long red candle. http://i.imgur.com/fo1Ok.pnghttp://

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi as002: Good question and the answer is Yes. I have a minimum size for a candle to be a valid RB. Hoewer its not a fixe size 50 or 100 pips, no. Its depend of my focal interpretation of price action. When we are talking about a chart based at Basket trading we must think that daily range is high cause is a several crosess average range. Price action is not equal than a single crosses. 1h bar of 100 pips is so small if you think that 1h average range is double or triple. In the chart example this bar is so smal and i see too that break of previous RB is not strong. The 21 EMA and Clouds is to far and is probable thats price retrace to EMA. No ever, but in most trades you can see that RB support is near 21 EMA and Clouds and price retrace and touch these supports. When you take a trade at confluencial of Low of RB, 21 EMA and Clouds its and idoneal settup. You are Buying at lows near support and selling at highs near resistence. EMA is the first support and Clouds its final support. If Clouds are Break another trend coulb be starting. I hope help you. Apologize my english please. All the best. Regards.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi all: Today i was good look. I dont take a Buy trade cause im wasnt infront computer at Assian Session. I was sleeping at this time. If i was take this trade i was loos -78 pips x 2 = 156 pips. But if a was take this trade i waited to retrace of next bar and closed position at BE. But. When you must wait to retrace?. Its depend of you MM. If bar was broken the range is so large and closed with strong +150 pips you must think that could be no retrace and next bar could be adding more loss. If price go against me 50 or 100 pips i assume more risk and i wait for retrace. If price go against me 150 or more i dont wait cause loss coulde be more. But if you assume more risk you can wait. Im playing with small stop loss but you can play with bigger stop loss if you want. You can use ATR. Other Ichimoku side or whatever you use. The problem of small stop is that hits often and however minimize loss. My first target is preserve my capital. Im trading with real money and its diferent to trade at demo. When you are risking real money first target is to preserve your capital and no make bigger amount of money. Well now i looking for long at low new Range Bar. All the best. Regards.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Im long now. Price touch low Range Bar. Enter Buy 2 positions. Position 1 target +225. Now +155. Regards.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Im out. Bar closed out range at -65 x 2 = -130 pips. I assume more risk and wait for retrace next bar. Closed Buy position at BE. Now im waiting for sell position at high of RB. Regards.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi all: I closed positions: be2: +1700 bd2: +2000 Still open positions: ba2: +2700 bb2: +2400 bc2: +1980 Regards.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks for the continuing updates, it helps to understand what you are doing. Couple of Q's if I may.... 1. How long have yo been trading this and what are the overall results? 2. You show the Cci ... do you use that as part of your signal? 3. Do you always trade the 14 pair basket and do you have results for the smaller baskets? Thanks, M. PS. Nice positions, makes the small -ve's worthwhile!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi All: Im short now. Enter at RB high 2 positions. Target1 at RB low +350. Position sa1-2. Regards.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi futurespec: thanks for question. 1. Im trading with real money for 15 months and demo for time long. But i dont only trade this system. Problem of basket trading is difficult to back test result. 2. CCI and others indicator are only a visual help to see how strong is trend. It isnt important but help me. Ichimoku is important for me cause it determine the trend direction but sometimes fall too. 3. I trade 14 pairs but you can probe at Core5 or another system and say me what do you think. I attach 2 charts. First is Basket chart and second is EURJPY chart. You can see the how similar are both. Likely it works in Core5 or others cause really you are trading with price action. I hope answer you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Price is in a mini-range between EMA and previuos RB Low. If a candle close above EMA its possible that price will go UP again. If a candle closed below previous RB Low its a good signal. Regards.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi all: Position Sa1 closed.Target1 reached. +350. Position Sa2 closed at BE. Now i waiting for longs. Regards.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Well: Today im looking for longs. I still open following positions: ba2: 3000 bb2: 2700 bc2: 2300 Regards.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks for the ongoing updates. Takes a brave man to show his trades. Been good so far but is that just a happy coincidence? At this rate you will be able to buy us all a Christmas present :-) (or perhaps that is your system). M.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Correct. I have now gone long on at 82.40 Just checking out the idea on demo.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi all: Price touch RB Low. Im long now. Enter 2 positions. Target1: +180 Pips. Good Look. Regards.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi fufurespec. Thanks for compliment. This forum help me a lot in past and i just want to give back some of learned. But all must remember what i recomended trade on demo untill you be familiar with the idea im showing. its obvious i think. Regards.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi hinnavaru. Good look.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
In theory i think this could be a good trade. If you see the chart attached of EURJPY we are buying at triangle breakout at retest it. I see too 1 hour 10EMA above 4 hours 10EMA and its a good signal. But nobody knows. Regards.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Well. Actual candle will go close at loss -100x2=-200 pips. You can do two things: 1. Assume loss 2. Wait for a retrace and close at BE assuming aditional risk. At this case i will asume aditional risk and no close Buy position. I think could be a retrace and i wait for close at BE. I will continue thinking that we are in an UP trend. Regards.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Update situation: If you see 4H chart for me trend is UP and price is retesting 21EMA. If yo see 1h chart EURJPY i hope price retest Day Low and go UP again. Regards.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Price touch RB low but i dont take the trade cause im long yet and im in loss. Until i dont close open trade i prefer dont add new positions. Regards.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Things are not changed. I will continue waiting with open position in -100. Regards.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Well. Buy position closed at BE in retest RB Low. I will look for another oportunitie at new RB Low. Regards

--- 帖子 #64 ---
When you are trading with real money sensations all diferent. In a demo account nothing is problem. If you are lossing no problem. You wait and if you blow account you open another and thats ok. If things are good oh oh oh. You have big profits thats shows to friends. But its no a real aproximation. When you are trading with real money the first and holy rule is protect your capital. You can lost some oportunities of win money. Now you can see how i trade six, seven trades and only one at profit. No problem. Most important for me is minimize loss. Is hard to see how you have a BE or Loss row but early or late price will go with strong and you will go with it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Well Im long now. Target1 : +260. Im in profif +180. Regards.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
GM Jaque, Good to see your continuing updates. Even better to see that thread is not being abused or people requesting addition of more indicators/filters. Am I correct in thinking that a lot of the success is down to your discretion as to when to set range bars and also the direction? ... your last long was taken at a price below the cloud and Ma (even though the bar did not close below)... is that because the longer TF was still showing buy conditions? M.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
GM futurespec. Most traders use a lot of indicator and i respect it but if indicator faill you faill too and then what happens?. You come back to look for another indicator that works. However, for me, price action dont change, could be change the volatility, volumen or trend size but not price action. If you master price action you knows what are you doing. Perhaps i dont master price action, my system is simple. Aswer to question is yes. At 4H chart you can see an UP trend with bars above ichimoku retesting EMA. For me trend dont change untill a bar close below clouds and EMA. But why wait to closed bar?. Cause for me closed bar is sure and tails are only noise and volatility. I hope answer your question. Have a good day. Regards.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Well i close two buy positions open days ago. Every position is closed when a down bar closed below EMA and Clouds forming a new Down RB and confirming a possible trend change. Now i look for short. If a Down trend is starting im selling at RB high. Regards.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi all: Today market is not my friend. I cant take a trade cause trend go down and no retrace but i still waiting and oportunitie. I hope that price you will see at 4h chart retrace near 4h RB High and go down again. Then i sell at 1h chart at last RB high. I hope it. In 1h chart you can see a lost sell trade. I dont take the trade at bar1. I dont at 21:00 infront of computer. But for me i dont take the trade cause range bar was so little 120 pips. If taked trade i win now +450 pips. But i dont worry, most times price come back. Regards.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Sorry but need to ask a Q again.... Ignoring the fact that bar 1 is only a short bar how would it have met your definitions of a range bar .... it did NOT I think close outside a previous RB. ? ... or should I ask which was the previous RB that you had set? M.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Your questions are wellcome. No doubt it. I attached a chart. All numbered bars are RB. Just follow de order. Regards.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Update situation: I hoped that price retrace to 4h RB high and thats ok. You see at chart 1. Explain chart 2: 1. Range Bar. 2. Sell at 78.30. 3. New RB. Closed sell position at retrace at BE. 4. Sell at 80.000. Regards.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thank you for your totally excellent explanations and your kind sharing of your ideas.. The charts are worth a thousand words. Really well done! M.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
trading is difficult today....

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi all: i will go to update my situation explained with chart attached. I looking for longs. 1. Sell at RB High. 2. Bar Closed above previuos RB. New RB. 3. Closed sell position at BE at retrace. 4. New RB. 5. Buy at RB low. Target1 +160. Rgards.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Well, since i started this thread i still opened several buy positions. These are results untill today: 7 Winner trades: 300, 1700, 2000, 350, 3000, 2700, 2300 = 12350 pips 9 BE trades. 2 Losser trades: 290, 360 = -650 Total Net Profit from 13.11.2012 = 11700 pips. Based on these results. What could be the conclusion? What do you think?.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
What do you think?. I think we should all trade for a week and then retire! If only it was that easy. Did you not close the earlier open trades when we had a retrace yesterday? What earlier positions do you still have open? Not in any way trying to knock your ideas, as I said before I appreciate your ongoing updates, but more a case of trying to fully understand how I could repeat it. M.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I do not mean to be conceited but the results are incorrect. I forgot add partial closed position at last UP trend: I must add to winner trades: 450, 330, 250, 340, 300, 400, 500, 300. Total 14570 pips. Believe me if a say that i dont publish results for presume. I publish for that you will see how powerfoul could be a trend system. If you can take a trend from start you will pay for a big drawdown if you first target is to protect your capital. Apologize for correction please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Well: Target1 reached. +160 pips.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
The bar where you entered your trade closed below your RB ... would you move the new RB to that downbar?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi futurespec. I say you that there is no problem with questions or doubts. I understand it. I attached a chart that explain better yesterday trades and today situation. At this moment i only still open Buy position called ba2 at last arrow. I explain chart: 1. Sell. 2. Closed BE. 3. Sell. 4. Closed BE. I hope help you sincerely. If you have any question there is no problem. Dont ofense me. Regards.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
No i dont move RB. This bar closed only 3-4 pips below. But there is no problem. If you move to new RB then you could buy at low of this down bar at confluence with EMA. Its was a good setup. Regards.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Enhorabuena Jaquemate por tu thread. Voy a seguirlo. Sorry but it's not so easy to find another spanish trader like me..... Cheers

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Several post ago i said that i dont move stop of ba2 position to BE. Why risk?. Well. If you see chart attached you will see a circle drawed. At this zone is possible a retest of price at confluence of RB Low, 21 EMA and Clouds. If you move to BE is possible you get out and price will go UP later. I prefer assuming a possible loss. I reached target1. Now im looking that ba2 position will survive today and capture a possible trend UP. Regards.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Well. Price retest RB Low. If you moved to BE position ba2 you go out now. I still in profit yet. Regards.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
You have taken a position long on last RB and closed half in profit .... Do you ever add to the position when the price retraces to the RB low again or only if it is a new RB. Thanks, M.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi Jaquemate, Excellent trading...well done! I have one very simple request from you since you are always having multiple posns open...say you have 6 baskets open and when you want to close say basket number 3, can you please describe the process of doing this? I have tried by putting the magic number of the basket I want to close on the close all script but it works sometimes and doesn't work most times??? Also, what are the options on the close all script, where the default setting is 3? I have tried also "playing" around with this setting to see if maybe that is where the problem maybe but still no luck. If you have the time and you know the function of each option, please advise as well. I hope my question is clear and I thank you in advance for your help. I have asked the same question on Kos's thread but noone has replied so far perhaps because they are not familiar with multiple baskets being open?! Mucha gracias again

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi futurespec. No i dont add new position. Its a personal decision but i considered that a RB is the start of a indecision time. Price go up and down untill buyers or sellers win the battle and price break range. This is why i closed early any loss, when a bar break and close out the range. Cause it could be start of a new trend but in worst case against me. And this is why i consider "noise" to bar tails, cause are only the attemps of win the battle. Hoewer, closed bar is the result of this battle at a time period. If bar is down, sellers win, if bar is up buyers win. If a down bar closed below open an up bar seller are in control and viceversa. I prefer add position when a trend is establised, then retrace.... you add a position and trend returns... Regards.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi nanomoto. Wellcome to thread. I hope that you understand my limited english. I apologize again for it. Its a good question. I do all manually. Only use scrips for open orders changin Magic Number. But if you have multiple positions open is difficult to closed it. I dont use any scrip for closed positions. If somebody knows how can help us. For knows every position i put it a reference Ba1, Bb1, Sa1, etc. When you put orders you can write at comment this reference. When you close a position manually you knows that it is. I hope help you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I was going to ask the same. So to make it clear, today there was just one trade at point 1, that netted about 147 pips (187-40)? http://i.imgur.com/fSNfK.png If you had missed the the first trade, would you open the second ?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I dont use any scrip for closed positions. If somebody knows how can help us. If the positions are opened with a script then it would be easy for script to assign MagicNumber to the position. ... which could also be assigned a different number each time the scipt is used. Then it should be easy to be able to close just the positions with the specific MagicNumber. M.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi as002: Your chart is not the same to mine but is no problem, the concept i explain you is valid. I was loss this trade if a bar closed below RB Low that you drawed with a line. If its happens then actual Range Bar is invalidated. Range bar was broken and this range not been respeted. Forget it. Market created a new Range Bar (number 4) and it is now our center of gravity. I hope explain it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi Jaquemate, When I was following kosomolate's thread a couple of weeks ago, I had realized the long wicks on hourly candles, but never thought of trading them in such a way. I appreciate it. I have some questions for you as I couldn't catch even if you told before: - Do you have trading times, i.e. from Frankfurt Open to London Close, etc. or do you trade 24/5? Although your strategies are different, downside of kos' system was you should stick to the screen as anything could happen in a M15 candle. Yours is better in this way that watching hourly charts should be easier. - How do you determine the initial RB, i.e. is it the first bar of the week or just the first candle you see in the morning? - And about SL. Although you don't use a fixed SL as far as I understand, how long would you wait before closing your trades, like in a news or intervention situation? - In relation to my question above, what percent do you risk per trade, or what is your R:R ratio I may say? Thanks in advance for your answers...

--- 帖子 #94 ---
GM Jaque, All, In response to your request to have script to close trades with Magic N please try the attached. Have just coded it and has NOT been tested but should work. Obviously use at own risk and on demo first. It should not affect any pending orders. Setting mMagicN to blank or zero will close ALL (repeat ALL) open orders. HTH. M. EDIT: slight mod to file so that '0' closes ALL open trades ... update in post#115 below

Hi isengoz. Wellcome to thread. I hope answer your questions. I trade from 08:00 to 20:00 Spain local time. At this time zone I am at office and can do it. Some time I said here that I don’t take a trade because I wasn’t in front of computer at moment. I don’t in front of computer all this time. I have others liabilities. However I show you all possible trades for that you will see how system works. I don’t take all. Some time I lost opportunities. If a good trade happens at 23:00 I am not in front computer at this time. Trade 1h chart is less stressful that 15m or 5m chart. Trade 4h chart is less stressful that 1h chart. The higher time frame is less stressful. Trading should be don’t exciting, should be boring. If you want to be in front of computer 14 hours a day every day and every week to the next 20-30 years you must think the stress level accumulated you are supporting. That is not for me. Price go UP or go DOWN. Time frame is relative. There are traders in front computer 16 hours a day to win 10 pips a day. Its not for me. Really you believe a person can live the next 20 years to trading with 10 pips a day?. I don’t know. When I off computer I was draw last RB limited. When I on computer next day I see if RB was broken and which is the new RB. In a Basket chart its useful to draw lines and draw open positions to knows where are. In a crosses chart you can see the open position but in a basket chart no. I don’t use fixed stop and I don’t understand why people use. It’s a broker gift. You are showing broker your cards in the game. But it is my personal opinion. If you use fixed stop and stop orders you will loss more time than if you don’t use…. Or you can use a biger biger stop that never been touch. When you don’t use stop you are assuming the risk of a big and fast movement against you and a bigger loss. But its don’t happens normally, only when an important news is announced. But in computing a long term I think you are minimizing loss when you don’t use a fixed stop and you wait to retrace price to BE point. I don’t have a fixed R:R. First position could be 1:1 or 1:3 and I use for replenish my capital and cover the drawdown. Second position could be 1:10, 1:15 1:20 all depends that markets wants give to me. Normally if a bar closed against me and loss is less than 150 pips I wait to retrace. If bar is so strong and loss is more than 150 pips could be not retrace and loss could be more if you don’t close position. But you don’t take this numbers, its only an approximation. All depend of global context of situation. Regards.

Gracias Caillou. Wellcome to thread. I dont see before your post. Regards.

GM futurespec: Thanks for script attached. It could be very ussefull. I probe at demo and coment. Regards.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Well, today im looking for longs again. Yesterday. price dont touch RB Low (1) and go UP confirming strong UP trend and forming a new RB today (2). Price dont retrace to RB Low (2) and breakout forming a new RB (3). Im looking for retrace around 83.65 for buy. I called order ba1-2. Close position ba1 at Target1: +350. Let run position ba2. Regards.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Jaquemate, gracias por su respuesta. I assume that you manage your trades via an EA. Which one do you use? By the way, I've been waiting since the morning and no setup has occurred yet. Maybe due to Friday... Esto es realmente un juego de espera...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi all: At chart attached you will see that if bar 1 dont closed below previous RB today 2nd buy position still survive and now is in +450 profit. Price dont touch yet drawed line but was near. I see the similitude between two zones drawed by circles. Its possible a range untill this zone and price will go UP.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
The 14 pair did not touch but the 6 pair did :-) Slight correction on my script ... setting to blank or '0' will close ALL pairs that do NOT have a MN. Apart from that it appears to work ok. M.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Attached is a larger view about the movement of the market. We are about to reach to the top that market turned down approximately 8 months ago. So, we might expect a bit more upwards movement, but be careful about holding the longer term trades. just my 3 cents...

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Ok. good luck if you are inside trend. Regards.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
same situation on the core5 pairs http://i.imgur.com/1L4uS.png three times touched the lower band. in case you missed the first, would you take one of the next two?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi as002. If im not in front of computer when price touch first i wait for another retest and take the trade. Is it you are asking me?. Regards.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Ok im inside market. Opened position ba1-2. ba1 target 350.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Well. If you look the 4h chart attached you see that price retest Low 4h RB. Its possible price breakout low and i have a temporal -200 pips against me before go UP again. I hope it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Price touch level of 81.50 at 4h chart and test EMA y go UP now. I was -170 against me. Now -50. Wait.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
See where i am at EURJPY 1h chart. Large up bar is doing to support.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Well Down bar closed below RB Low but only 10 pips. I dont close trade yet. At 4h chart is important to see down bar dont close below Low RB and see too the 84 line. How price is ranging about it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
My 6 pair did not reach first profit target and new RB so I have now closed at BE. Is this what you would have done? M.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi futurespec: What Basket are you using?. Core 5?.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
As per post and graphic ... 6 pair (which is mine). Uses... "GBPUSD", "EURUSD", "AUDUSD", "GBPJPY", "EURJPY", "AUDJPY" M. PS. How do you open your basket? Do you hit the buy button immediately the price hits the RB low or do you wait to see what happens there? Would you use an EA to automate the whole thing or is there too much discretion involved? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks futurespec...script seems to be fine..just tried demoing a few trades Now I don't need to worry about the options tab on the close all script in Kos's thread. The buyall/sellall works great there but I was hampered and could not open more then one position at a time..now that I have your script, it will be kickass time from Monday

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Natomoto, Pleased it helped a little. I did do a slight mod so that it now does close every open trade if mMagicN is set to '0'. M.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi futurespec/jaquemate, Is there any way you know of to put limit and stop orders on the offline charts using the chart (basket) values? If this tool is available...what can I say, it would be great...and I have a strategy which would bring in 80%+ winners. Much obliged if either of you or anyone else reading this thread could assist. Thx &amp; rgds and nice weekend to all!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Sure. Apply this EA to your offline chart (post 1832) http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...27#post6232027 You have Market, Limit and Stop orders, BE, Trailing......works perfect. Play with it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #118 ---
GM all: Today im looking for shorts. At 4H chart i see price touch several times 84 resistence. Price is in a range inside a previuos trend UP. However at 1h chart price is below Clouds and EMA and im looking for shorts. Could be the start of a Down trend. At 1h if someone taked RB1 you must sell at bar2. Then Bar3 closed above RB1 and you must closed at BE at bar4. Know my question for you is..... Do you think Bar3 is a RB?. Then what do you do? Sell... Buy?... Why?... Regards.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
GM, You identified resistance on 4hr. Bar 1 is RB for a sell as it closes below cloud &amp; ema Should short on next bar. Bar 3 is NOT new RB as it closes inside range RB 2 No close above cloud so I would still be short? Or if you wish the close at BE. To my mind the 4hr and Daily are still in uptrend so would be careful about taking shorts just yet. M.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
GM futurespec: Ok good interpretation. I only have one coment. For me bar 2 dont close out RB1. Bar2 is not a RB. However bar3 close above RB1 then it could be a new RB. Its only my personal interpretation. I dont think bar3 is a RB cause range is only 120 pips. Its so little and its break with easy. A 100 pips bar can not delimited a price range. Too, Its closed above EMA but dont close above clouds. But itsn a problem. If we considered bar3 how a RB then we look for sell at bar4 around 84.50 and we closed first position at +120 profit and second position is still open at +110. Now im looking for shorts. Two arrows are good points to enter sell. Preferibly at RB5 high. RB5 is actual RB. Regards.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi everyone Waiting a Sell at arrow. Trendline tells that too..... Let's see.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi all: Price touch High RB. Im short now at 84.50. Pos. sa1-2 Targetsa1 +220 pips. Good luck Caillou. Regards

--- 帖子 #123 ---
wooow -190 against. No fear now. wait to closed. Control fear please.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
If this UP bar close above RB close position. If close below 100-120 pips against me i wait to retrace. Regards

--- 帖子 #125 ---
-130 pips (included spread) first demo trade...... Cheers

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Bar closed -100 against me. I assume more risk waiting for retrace to BE. 4h chart say UP with strong. 1 hour to finally actual bar. I hope retrace at this bar. Regards.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Im sorry mate. Im still inside market. Regards

--- 帖子 #128 ---
So this highlights the problem about whether or not the higher TF should take precedence. At least it kept me out but perhaps just out of fear :-( M.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Why sorry? Everybody takes his own decisions so not problem at all

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Well. I closed Sell position sa1-2 at BE after wait to retrace. Now im looking for longs. 1h &amp; 4h are UP. Regards.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Caillou, Thanks for that. I simply need a way that I can put in Stop and/or limit orders as you would on a normal chart along with the (movable) TP and SL lines feature which I believe this has. I find my screen is too cluttered if I put this EA on it. Is there anyway to "isolate" just these elements and use this EA? Much obliged. Thanks again and happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
GM All: Today im looking for longs. Daily chart say UP trend. Price are moving inside a Range from RB day 23. 4H chart say UP too. Price are moving inside a RB yet. Breakout resistence at 84 and now became at support. At 1h chart for me points arrows are good zones around enter buy positions. Regards.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
GM Jaque, Couple of Q's please.... 1. What indi is generating the arrows? 2. Why you have new RB (on 1hr) when last RB range has not seen new RB close outside? M.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
GM futurespec: I drawed arrow. I dont use any indicator. Arrows are only a visual help. I know that yesterday´s large up bar is actual RB but its been 20 bars and price dont retrace untill Low. I establish todays low as reference point to enter buy. If i enter at todays Low im risking 80 pips more than enter at Low RB. I know it. If you respect rules the lower arrow is the correct entry level. Regards.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
If you had left the original RB in place then the last bar would be the new RB and a nice entry @ 85.54 So still the Q. how much discretion to use. M.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi all: Im agree with you futurespec. 2 hours ago is the new RB. Im long now. Buy at 85.50. target1: +250. Regards.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
6 pair worked ok. (but only for 87 pips excl spread). Half closed, half BE. M.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Pos. ba1 closed. Target1 reached: +250 pips. Pos. ba2 still open. Regards.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi Sorry. I don't know how to do that. Cheers

--- 帖子 #140 ---
New RB's and entries on 6 &amp; 14 pair. When the long entry is from a downbar RB is there a minimum distance from close to low of RB that you look for for entry?? M.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I'm also in a long from the last RB retracement and aiming for 225 pips. We shall see what will happen.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
hi natomoto, that's what I thought of when I first saw jaquemate's technique. anyway, after caillou referred to that EA post at kos' thread, I sent GVC, who posted this EA, a PM to help us. I hope he checks his PMs and comes to help us. then trading this technique would be much more easier, I think.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi all. Today i reached target1 +250 with ba1 position. Ba2 closed at BE after wait to retrace. Now im long around 84.85. Target1 +225. At 1h chart i like to see trend line and price retesting it and UP again. I hope do it one more time. I like to see ichimoku acting as support. But i dont like two things. Price is below EMA and at 4H chart price is dropping from High RB. Regards.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
GM everyone: Todays overnight a large UP bar touched yesterdays high RB forming a new RB. I closed ba1 position at target1: +225 ba2 position still open and now is at +460. Move this position to BE. Today i still looking for longs. Regards.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
This is my personal analisys of actual situation: At Daily chart you can see how todays bar breakout RB with strong. If todays bar close above RB then we have a new RB and its possible price sideways following days inside the range. At 4h chart a new RB is formed. Now i hope price retrace and two drawed lines acting as support. At 1h chart a new RB is formed too. Its only 150 pips of range. Be cautious. Its possible price retrace to mark circle at confluence between EMA and clouds acting both as support. If you take this buy trade you must be cautious or can suffer a loss. RB is so small and coulbe be broken easily. Now most important thing is that ba2 position survive to todays volatility and dont close at BE. If it occurrs coulbe be start of a new UP trend. Regards.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
GM Jaque, Good explanation again. Thanks for continuing updates. GL with Ba2 M.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Ok. Congratulations to someone taked todays buy trade. Target1 reached: +150. Regards.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
No congrats for me :-( Did not take it as was not a RB for me .... the close was only just outside previous RB. Still not tuned in to your discretion techniques. M.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
GM futurespec. No problem. I dont taked this trade. I have explain in a previous post the reasons. Your interpretation is good. RB closed only 30 pips above previous RB and Range is 150 pips. Also previous RB is so large and i think there are high posibilities of price retrace below small RB. Regards.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I said that i dont have a minimum size to consider a bar how a RB. All depends on the overall context. However if you have more confortable with a fixed number you can consider how minimum size 140 pips (14 pairs x 10 pips) and how minimum closing out range 14 pips (14 pairs x 1 pip). It can help you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Well: a new RB is formed. You can enter a buy position at low. I wait to more retrace. Regards.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi all: If you are following this thread you know this system I called RBBS (Range Bar Basket System) is a trend system. Main idea is to capture a short term trend at 1h chart when price stops and fluctuates in a range price. When price is established at a price range we buy at range low and sell at range high hoping for position survive to daily fluctuations. Also, we close half position to reach other side range for replenish capital account and cover futures drawdowns. Now my question is…. Is this system improvable?. And the answer is definitely YES. You can maximize profit possibilities implementing a sideway system inside this trend system. Creating a system Level 2 to enter buy &amp; sell order at range zone with fixed target on the other side of range. But how?.... Just watch the price action inside range. Price hit again and again until price breakout the range. We can take advantage of it. I don’t have time to explain in one post how we can do it. I will publish in several post how to do it. Continue. Regards.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Jaque, Can see what you are saying but personally prefer just to keep it simple. Extra options only confuse things and thoughts. If it works for you then great. With the returns that you have shown over the last couple weeks I do not see the need for more. I was trying to work with just 6 pairs and only on demo for now. Today would have entered twice (as shown) and not too good so far today. Watching the support areas.... may exit if too painful. For me the 14 pair has no trade yet today. (I do not use offline charts, just my own indi) M.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi all: Im long now. Enter bb1-2 position around 87.90 level. Target1 240 pips. Still open ba2 position at +340 now. Regards

--- 帖子 #155 ---
WTG Jaque :-)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Excuse but waht is WTG?.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
"Way to go"

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Ok, thanks. i dont know it.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Im agree with you but believe me, when i explain more details you are sure that this implementation is easy to understand and easy to execute. Regards mate.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
could you post the indi you are using? is it painting the Rb h/l by itself?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi all: I continue with my explanation of Level2 system implementation. All this dates are not real, its an aproximate. Imagine we have a data base around 6000 1h bars that it is 1 year ago or 250 trading days. Now you think that there is an average of two RB daily. Then we have 500 RB at period time. Normally when a RB is formed price hit limits range several times until range is broken. Now the question is to determine the average number of times that price touch this limits at every 1h RB and build a percentage classification of this dates. For example. Price touch 1 time limits and then breakout……… 5% of 1h RB. Price touch 2 times limits and then breakout…… 5% 1h RB. Price touch 3 times limits and then breakout……. 10% 1h RB. Price touch 4 times limits and then breakout……. 20% 1h RB. Price touch 5 times limits and then breakout…… 35% 1h RB. Price touch 6 times limits and then breakout….. 30% 1h RB. Price touch 7 times or more limits and then breakout……. 5% 1h RB. With this classification we can elaborate a system that enter buy and sell orders when price hit range limits at consonance with percentage data base. If we can find a percentage range thats give us a matematic success probability we can enter buy and sell orders to capture profit when price is ranging leaving open the last order to capture trend. Think in it please. I continue. Regards.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
For me the 14 pair trade would have just been taken @ 86.19 Initial target 89.62 M. PS. As002 ... yes it puts in the Rb H/L itself

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Jaque Do you have any real statistics on that or is it just an idea so far?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Jaque, Reading and trying to understand this thread. Look intersting. Manage to set the H1 offline chart.... Now what don't understand, which curreny does the #kos#14 represent and which currency pair do I trade? Very sorry if my question weird....

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi Isengoz I received your pm and thought that i would respond here. I have briefly read through Jaque's thread and more or less understand the strat. I do not think that it will be too difficult to put into a TLE for auto trading, only problem is that i am swamped in work at the moment. I will certainly give it a try when i get the chance. Fortunately you have an excellent coder in FutureSpec here on the thread, so if i get stuck i am sure to holler.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hope someone took that 14 pair. (mentioned above) Nice 350 pips .... good 3-4 hours work :-) M.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi all: At last 3 hours I´ve been very busy and I could not publish any update. This is step by step owervie of todays trades. Chart #1: I buy at arrow and closed both positions at blade at BE (really minimal loss). Chart #2: New RB is formed. I waited for closed previous buy position at BE. Then Buy again bc1-2 at arrow. ba1 position closed at target1 +220. Chart #3: New RB is formed. I wait for retrace to enter buy position but im not sure that price retrace below 87.50 support. I see so strong trend UP. Still continue open following buy position: ba2: +460 p. bc2: +330 p. Regards

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Good job futurespec, congratulations. First profit trade?. Regards.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Wellcome to thread donwan: Questions are wellcome. Here you have crosses: AUDUSD, EURJPY, EURUSD, USDCHF, GPBJPY, GBPUSD, EURGPB, CHFJPY, EURCHF, NZDJPY, GPBCHF, AUDJPY, USDJPY, NZDUSD. When you enter a Buy order you are buying all these pairs. Regards.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Thanks for your time and reply, George. Hope to see you here again soon.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Jaque, I would like to thank you for starting this thread , you have done a excellent job of describing your method I have read every post and looked at all the screenshots and it all makes perfect sense. Buying at the low of the range is so obvious , but I never worked out how to do it before ..... Thank you..

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi all: Apologize but i cant publish any update untill next monday. Now im not at office im on holidays today and tomorrow. Next monday i reply all questions and return at activity. Today and tomorrow only i can do is monitoring ocassionally my computer. Apologize again. Regards.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Jaque, Np, have a good weekend. NFP today anyway so best to be wary. For any that are following then there was a setup this morning and already reached its' 150 first target. (Horiz white lines drawn manually) M.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Also on 6 pair trade coming up at 123.12 Only 100 pips and NFP. Just trying an auto trade taking EA (That is the Triangle for any that ask) M.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks Jaque, Looking at current situation, its a BUY at 89.565 ( if I'm not wrong ). How does the BUY order been done?? Do it manually every pair? Is there a way to be done with one click? OR BUY pending order? Regards

--- 帖子 #176 ---
First .... apologies for my post above ... I have lost a day somewhere and was thinking today was Friday. Donwan... not sure where you got price from ... I do not agree with it??? For 1 click you need a script or EA to do it for you. M. EDIT: my set up for the 14 pair attached ... shows a buy at 87.93 ... although v close to support areas on 1hr. Jaque is the one you need to give a more definite answer.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi All, I stumbled on this thread last night (having heard from a veteran FF contributor that he finds range bars useful), and read it eagerly- the results are too good to be true. I really hope they come same on a live account, as Jacquemate has nicely indicated for himself ! What has occurred to me is that this Jacque-method is eerily similar to the Flying Buddha Volatility breakouts described by EasyPips on his Equity Millipede thread starting Post #845 in a few posts, as below: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...29#post3948029 EasyPips starts by describing a past engulfing candle, while here Jacquemate talks about a 'big' candle that engulfs past smaller candles, and which is replaced by a new range bar if the hi-low price range is violated by a newer candle. The general Flying Buddha scalp method uses a formation clean above a 3/5 ema and then stacks entries and closes them as new conditions (candle open/close below the emas) arise. Very interesting ... Perhaps the rules can be combined and an Indy/EA written, without re-inventing the wheel(s.) I do see the very code-accomplished futurespec leading with Q&amp;A here Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
as jaque won't be here until monday, I think I can update yesterdays trades with a chart. I saw 2 opportunities for long which resulted in around 355 pips. as the price closed below the cloud I think time for a retrace has come. but I should tell that I didn't check the HTF charts. just my opinion... by the way, futurespec if you can write code as GVC told us, could you take a look at the code of order management EA that Caillou referred. I saw some disabled strings related to pending orders, but I don't know how to enable them. I think this method is not possible for me without such an EA that I can't keep looking at the screen all day waiting for the price to hit the RB line. I'd be grateful if you could help.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
GM all, OK ... It is nice to read that several people have more faith in my coding than I do myself! I will post my indi on the basis that you take it 'as is' and do not ask for continual updates/improvements. I only did it for my own usage and I am happy to 'work around' any minor issues that it has. 1. It does NOT need offline charts ... that is why I tried to code it. 2. Every time MT4 is reloaded the chart needs the TF changing and back again for the correct bars to show. 3. Sometimes when doing this incorrect values may show ... just change TF again. 4. Currently mPairsUsed can be set ONLY to 6 for my 6 pairs (first 6 pairs in list), 14 for Jaque 14pr basket and 99 for 6 GBP pairs. "GBPUSD", "EURUSD", "AUDUSD", "GBPJPY", "EURJPY", "AUDJPY", "EURGBP", "USDCHF", "NZDUSD", "USDJPY", "NZDJPY", "GBPCHF", "CHFJPY", "EURCHF"}; 5. mHistEntry is number of bars back to check for RB's. 6. mMinDiff is minimum distance that a bar must close outside of previous RB for bar to be new RB. 7. I have set the history to 300 as I don't want to check before that. 8. Black and white lines are 21 and 50 SMA. 9. Lime &amp; violet areas are my interpretation of Ichimoku 10. You will need to set the chart max/min on the chart to relevant values (chart/ properties/scale fix) 11. Put on a chart that has most ticks coming in. 12. You can change the chart TF at will so can get to see 4hr, Daily etc to check higher TF's OK for now that is it; possibly forgot stuff. REPEAT... take it as is or bin it. (If you do not like it do not use it!) It was coded for me, not for general release. Trade entry EA to follow ... WIP. M.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
This is what my chart looks like (as you will have seen in previous posts) The triangle, green line, red horiz line are form the trade EA and will not show on the indi. M.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
OK... Now for EA. It is a work in progress .... it may work, it may not (USE AT OWN RISK). The trade entry should work but the exit may not yet work ... have not tested. Any improvements/updates will come when and if I have time OR may not come at all!!!! 1. Put the indi (from prev post) onto chart. 2. Enable expert advisors and put the attached EA onto that chart. 3. mPairsToTrade set to match pairs used on the indi. 4. mLeftPos set to number of bars ... if triangle moved before that bar it stops looking for entry (Triangle '('T') should turn orange 5. mMN is the MagicN for the trades using this EA 6. Select the T 7. Move down ... should turn red ... to set pending SELL basket. 8. Move up... should turn blue... to set pending BUY basket. 9. Moving the T puts a horiz line at trade entry point ... set to RB (red for sell, blue for buy) 10. The trade entry line is then movable to your wishes if you want a different entry point. 11. On entry a green horiz line should show which is meant to be the exit point (again movable) WIP. 12. Don't forget ..... move T left to cancel any pendings. 13. It will only work while MT4 is working .... NOT for any orders when MT4 closed !!!! Enjoy. ALL disclaimers apply (use it on DEMO) M. EDIT: Error noticed in EA ... will update later

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Updated. Still no guarantees! But looking better. M.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
hi futurespec, the indi appeared on the screen just once, and then lost. I can see only the spread and RB values. What settings do I have to enter for the 14 pairs?. I tried 80-90, 0.8-0.9 but didn;t work edit: found it. placed it on yen pair

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Sorry, like I said, WIP !! It appears OK to me at the moment. M.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
mine too. the EA needs to be treated with caution!!!!!!! http://i.imgur.com/BS94n.png

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Errrr!!! That is what I said REPEATEDLY. This was only posted as a favour after requests.... and also said WIP Like I said if you do not like it then bin it! M.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
futurespec thanks for the indie and the EA. I followed your steps up to 6. but the triangle stayed orange. and I think the EA is not working at the moment although I see smiling face in the top right corner. what might be the reason? you got any ideas?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
for the Nth time I said from the start the EA is a WIP It can and does give unexpected results at the moment If you are not happy with it just do not use it yet. NO WAY USE IT LIVE !! The T is an poor attempt at getting a user button. MT4 does not provide one. It works for me. If it did not change colour then try moving it again. If the TradeEntry line has moved and changed colour (Red sell, blue buy, white no order set) then the pending is set. M

yeah bro, I know what you said and I'm not using it live, don't worry. I just wanted to try it as you replied to our request which I appreciate, but couldn't make it work. so asking the coder a question or two is a normal thing in my opinion. anyway, it seems that I will wait for your updates if any. by the way, you did a good job with the indicator. at least it saves me from looking which candle the RB is. thanks for that...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
NP. I only posted as I appreciated Jaque's kind contribution. It is best not to use the EA for now. If you want a simple script to buy sell basket trades then you can try the attached... again with disclaimers. It will trade the pairs in the order that they appear in the list. mHowManyPairs ... set to 1 trades 1st pair, 6 trades first 6 pairs etc &lt; 14 The idea of the EA was to automatically set the price to the latest RB H/L and make life easier..... and then set an exit price. It does that but still has errors! M.

Couple minor mods. Can now set own Ma colours for those that have black background. Just discard previous files and use these. EA v1.0 needs Bag Test v1.0 to work correctly. Still issue with T not always changing from orange every time ... if TradeEntry is set (not white) but T remains orange then need to move T again before it will be ready to enter trades. Bit messy ... maybe... like I said MT4 has no button function so it is a workaround. It works OK for me but needs treating with care If you note any issues then let me know ... no promises. M. EDIT: Files updated below

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Just a slight update but continue to check it M.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Pairs option missing. is it set for 14 or any chart applied to?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
You are awake then ;-) It is not needed. It defaults to the number of pairs used for the chart. (You must use the latest 2 files) M.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
it works much better.. sensitivity is better, reaction to triangle moves is ok, opens the trades on the touch of the line, .....but it has an issue with closing the trades on the green line.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
please explain the issue so that I can take a look. M.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
It does not close basket on green line. Tried many times with no result.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
asoo2 with the code that I had in there I am not surprised :-( Try this. It is still a WIP (and as I said was only originally inteneded for my own use) and will check and amend if/when I get time. M. EDIT: Please note: If you are using a different script to close the trades by MagicN then the number assigned to the trades is appended with the number of pairs. i.e. MN = 1 by default so the MagicN assigned is 16, 114, 199 for 6, 14 and GBP pairs respectively

GM all: Today is a dificult day. I attached Daily, 4h and 1h chart and you can see why. At Daily Chart trend is UP. At 4h chart trend is UP too. However at 1h trend is Down. What do you do today?. If you take only 1h chart you must follow the rules and you must look for short at high 1h RB but if you consider high time frame trend is UP. Im looking for short today. I will go against high time frame and i will explain why more late. I invite you to show your own analisys. Regards.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
GM Ianp: Thanks for cumpliments. You are wellcome to thread and all questions are wellcome. Thanks again. Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
GM Jaque, I agree with the potential short trade as it could be the start of a new downtrend so it is worth covering this possibility here with the 4hr borderline. Must remember that daily is still up so be prepared to exit if things don't pan out. M.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
GM futurespec: Exactly. At daily chart trend is UP but i marked fridays bar and i see large wicks. For me it is an indecision day. Buyers and sellers are pushing but nobody wins. If you see this tipe of bars at past you can see that most time is a trend change. If you Sell high now you can capture a possible down trend from the start. Risk is the same that a single trade but reward could be enormous. With the 4 h chart happens the same. The chart say that trend is UP and price is testing Low RB for UP again. Hoewer Price now is below EMA and clouds and could break Low RB and close below. If it happens then for me trend is changing. Now high time frame trend is UP but i see signals that say me situation could be changing and potencial profit could be enormous. Regards.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
If actual 4h bar closed below Low RB for me it is a Down trend confirmation. Regards.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Well. 4h bar closed below previous RB. Price is below EMA and clouds. Im looking for shorts opportunities. If someone wants to risk you can look 1h chart. You can buy at Low Daily RB and wait for price go UP and touch High 4h RB. If 1h bar closed below line you can closed at loss or BE. I prefer wait price retrace HRB and enter sell around 87.50. Regards.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
futurespec the EA is perfect. On the charts, probability that will make nice bounce on the lower bar of the 1HR Range Bar is high.

Hi Athar. Wellcome to thread. You are talking about Mr.Graeme and for me he is one of the best trader i know ever. But above all he is a great great person. His teaching are incalculable value. Priceless. Regards.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Jacquemate, Thanks for the welcome... So what do you think of Greame's Flying Buddha strategies, and how would you compare your system with his ? Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Well. Im in the market. At 4h chart price touch HRB. Sell around 87.35. Enter position sa1-2. Target1 at LRB: +360. If you buy at Daily Low RB congratulations. You first target is reached: +375. Regards.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Update situation: 4h bar closed above previous RB. Its a weak close but i prefer dont risk and closed Sell position at BE. Regards.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
just got in front of the terminal. Did not take any trade since last post. I've placed a limit sell order (23:44 GTM+1) order on the 1H chart with the futurespec EA on the live account. http://i.imgur.com/mBAhq.png

--- 帖子 #214 ---
as002, Pleased that you have faith but PLEASE NOTE that it is early days and the EA has not been fully/properly tested and it is still possible to get unintended results. Just do not want you to lose money on live account due to any unforeseen errors. To me this morning longs would be the preferred direction due to the strong daily and now the 4hr starting to get above the cloud. I could well be wrong and usually am once I try to make a judgement call. ;-) We are in an area of some indecision and for me at least it may be better to wait a short while until the picture is clearer. I know that entering at the start of a trend is what we want to do but there will always be a chance to trade a little later. GL with your trade. M.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
GM all: Today im looking for longs. At Daily chart price touched yesterday LRB and go UP. At 4h chart a new RB was formed yesterday. Last bar closed above EMA and Clouds confirming an UP trend. At 1h chart price is above EMA and Clouds. While price remains inside range of fridays large UP bar anything can happens. That 600 pips bar for me is the key to that will make price. That is the actual RB but if you consider it then you must look for shorts!!. I said anything can happens. In this situation only you can do is probe, trade and probe. If you trade 1,2,3,4 times and loss or BE thats ok. Be patient. But when you take the correct trade could be the start of a new trend Down o the resumption of Up trend. I understand that wait for price touch levels is slow....... and if after it you faill and loss or BE... its mentally hard. 4,5 BE in a row is mentally hard. This system dont look for small gains with a high winning percentage. Only with 1 winner trade that capture a 1000-1500-2000 pips you pay all previous loser trades. I sure you. I have seen in past a lot of times. I have seen that i closed a trade with 500 pips thinking that is so good and thinking.... wowww ... i go to closed it.. 500 pips!!!!. But after closed price will continue and will continue and reached 2000 or 3000 pips. If a was taked cold blood 2000 extra pips pay me for a long time. This is a real history believe me. For me is better wait to 1 big winning trade while small loss or BE are happens. Think in it please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
GM as002: I recomended you that dont trade a live account untill you dominate system. You will have many oportunities at future. Dont run please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
GM futurespec: Perfect interpretation. Regards.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
GM Jaque, Good post :-) Waiting is definitely the hard part and taking several small losses or BE can be mentally draining but as you so rightly point out the eventual rewards are WORTH IT!! M.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
An alternative to can trade at this situation is forget the actual RB. How?. Ok dont forget but we are looking for put an order at exact price and if we to expect a that price touch RB............... You can do it and probe. Look and find actual RB inside large RB. At 1h chart i drawed it. You can probe to enter a buy order at arrow. Its a good zone between EMA and Clouds. You probe, risk. If price go UP from this point you are inside market and good look. I go long at this zone. Its only a sugerence. But most times it works. Regards.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
good morning jaquemate, thanks for your daily interpretation. in that post of yours, you just mentioned about the subject I've been thinking for a while: pips and money management. you send your results nearly real-time and posted your weekly results a couple of pages back, but risking part of this method is still vague for me. I am not talking about pips or dollars because these are relative values, what is absolute is the % you risk each trade. you can make 2000 pips every day or every week, but if this just makes 2% of your account then it is no different than 20 pips from my point of view, just the lot size changes. in this regard, as we know you don't have a hard stop, can you tell us about your money management? how do you decide the lot size or increase/decrease the amount you trade, etc.?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
MM for me is not how for most traders. A Habitual formula is: If I have 10000$ and I risk 2% at every trade position sizing is…. I respect it and it works for millions traders, sure. I don’t doubt. Its generally accept. There is a lot of books about MM……. But my question is: Is it the only way? Why?. There is millions of systems to trade money and only 1 MM method with multiples variables?. Do you think that volatility market respect you risk percentage?. All see it a lot of times. You put a stop order or simply mental stop fixed and price touch it and out. 1,2,3,4….. times. When Im trading i think at context of actual moment and risk agree it. I wrong, ok. No problem. It is my responsibility. My money. But it is a difficult concept to understand. I know it. People needs to know how money could be loss before enter a trade. Its gives people security. People needs to know that all its controlated. But it could be a false security. It’s a security loss at most cases. Its obvious that you need a start amount of money to start trading. Minimum size is microlot. I you trade 14 microlots or 1.4 minilots you know how many money you need to start. Add spreads cost, margin, etc. Too its obvious that if you are losing an important part of your account you must stop trade, but for me could be 30% and for you could be 50%. I can fix a percentage limit for security. Don’t risk more that an amount for trade. But this amount its an aproximation. I can limit loss inside a level but my thought is that risk must be adapted to market context. For me this is one of reason that most traders fails. But this is only my personal vision. I don’t know if I explain it correctly. It isn’t a critic of generally MM methods. No. Its only my vision and application of it. Every trader must find his own MM way to be comfortable with it. I understand that most people can´t understand I saying. I accept. I don’t teach no body. I respect all ways of trading. All ways. There is no one way of trading. There is no one way to make money and there is no one way to MM. At least for me. Regards.

Hi all: I enter buy position ba1-2 at 89.25. Target 1 +240 pips. Regards.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi again: futurespec. i was thinking about my idea of improve this system adding a level2 and the main problem i found is difficult to backtest it. This is my question for you. Is possible to create an indicator that shows in a basket chart all RB?. For example changing colour or drawing the lines untill range is broken?. if it is possible then visually its possible test i can do. I attached a chart. Anything similar to this. Regards.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi Jaque, Yes it must be possible (famous last words!). The indi that I have already highlights all the old RB's with the white vertical lines. Not totally sure what you want after that? Just horiz lines until the next RB? M.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Well. Buy position ba1 closed at target 1: +240. Still open position ba2: +200 now. Regards.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi futurespec: I think that is all i need. If indicator drawed all horizontal lines display could be dificcult. Only by differenciating RB would be perfect for display range. Regards.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Is this what you mean? M.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi futurespec: Its perfect. Thank you very much. Only one question. Is it possible to eliminate vertical lines?. Is it possible horizontal lines only drawed until breakout bar?. thanks again. Regards.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Just reduce the figure in mHistRb M.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Perfect. An excelent job. Thanks again. It could be very useful. Regards.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Brilliant work futurespec and Jaquemate! Futurespec, is there anyway I can use either your EA or any tool you may know of from this or Kos's thread which will basically allow me to MANUALLY open trades (with limit and stop orders) AND also give me the functionality of having the (visual) move lines for my SL and TP? I do not wish to use an EA to open and close my trades so really all I am looking for is to be able to use these features which are part and parcel of what you have provided but which I presume can only be used with the EA. I hope I am able to convey my thoughts and I did pose the same question on Kos's thread. Much appreciated...keep up the awesome work!! N

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Very interesting work, can I have a reference to the template that you are using to display your charts ( I have looked in the thread but cannot see it) Thanks in anticipation

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi lucklogic. Wellcome to thread. I attached template i showed at previous post but i must remember all people that indicator creator is futurespec. Merit is for him. Regards.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thank you and all the very best of luck with this endeavor and thank you Futurespec for sharing too !

--- 帖子 #237 ---
GM all, Thanks for the acknowledgement, it is always well received. Just hope it helps in some small way. Natamoto ... like you say the EA within the thread was intended for use with the indi. (and still needs improvements) I would have thought that a search would provide numerous trade placing EA's/ scripts. If you are unsuccessful then I may, repeat may, take a look at coding something. M.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi futurespec, Thanks for your valuable input. Yes there are numerous scripts etc for this but the challenge I am having is getting them to work on offline charts..?! If only I could get a script/EA which would enable me to manually place my limit/stop orders and also my SL and TP, then I am home and dry! I have the same challenge creating a Renko chart off the offline charts we setup with this system of trading.. any ideas/suggestions there? Of course it would be great if and when you are able to look at this but I would understand if this won't be possible. N

--- 帖子 #240 ---
NOTE: The EA posted earlier in thread will NOTwork with the indi amended for Jaque. Will look to amend. M.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Buenos dias Jaquemate I have been looking at your system a few days now and I have a question: are you taking trades (demo or live) or are you calculating results looking at charts? I tell you this because Highs and Lows of candles calculated by Basketv6 indicator are not real, I mean when you see a candle in the past has just touched the High or Low of the RB, this High or Low is never reached by the price. This problem has been already discussed in T101 thread. So by a visual backtest you will see a lot of wicks that touched High/Low of RB but in real time the price has never touched these limits, so a lot of trades are not taken in real time. This "wrong" wicks are really clear when you look at the candles and its formation in real time. This is a fact. How do you solve this problem?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Amended files. The indi no long shows the vertical white lines unless mShowVlines is set to true. The EA has been amended to work with the latest version of the indi. It still has not been tested properly and I urge you NOT to use on live account until you are happy with it. The size of the triangle can be changed by selecting the LOWER 2 corners and moving to required size (if you move the higher corner it will affect the trades). The only idea behind the EA was to set pending orders at the RbH or RbL (so as to capture the price at any spike though the RbH/L) It now also sets the exits point .... first at the opposite RbH/L and then if only partial close at double the RbH/L range. The entry and exit lines can be moved after set by the EA and become live at the new level set by user if required. There is still a high probability of potential errors with the EA ... if you use and find some let me know. The 2 files work together. The EA will not work without this indi. M.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Buenos dias Caillou: Yes. Its happens always cause basket indicator is a crosses average price and price oscillates. If you see chart when bar body is making a new high or low you will see that wicks are descending or ascending at same time. Itsn a problem for me cause i really enter position when i see that wick touch the line or wait some minutes and leave that wick break line. Not is important if price is real cause price is not real. Not is important if price touch really the line or not. The spread of this oscillate could be 20... 30 pips. Its not important. Im looking for 1000 - 2000 pips. Important is that you are buying in a lower zone or selling in a higher zone. Before take a trade i look at a single chart. i.e. EURJPY and see the aproximate zone where order will be put. When you take a trade with a basket chart at LRB you can check after a single chart. i.e.EURJPY or another crosses. You will see that trades are puts at support and resistance zones. Thats is the main idea of the system. Another thing that you are not mention happens too. And this is a problem for me. If you use higher time frame for look the global situation context and after you go to lower time frame to take multiples entries you can check how at lower time frame (i.e.5m or 15m) most times price never has same level and most times price never touch line that price are touching at higher time frame. Its a problem for me cause my main idea is to look at global situation context and after go to lower time frame to take entries and i cant do with basket chart. I said many times here that i taking trades at live account and duplicate at demo account for look at diferents exit options and check results. I said too that im not infront computer all day and i cant take all possible trades but i want to show all possible trades. Its a hard work to do it manually but all system could be improvement. This is not a critical to other people on this forum. Sure NO. But i think that is not realistic to show people a system that you are not probing with real money in a live account. Its not trading. Its another thing. Its playing with irreal numbers. Sensations play a very very important paper in trading and could be turn a winner system in demo in a losser system in live. But it is only my personal opinion. Regards.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Gracias Jaquemate, All clear now for me. So you usually enter trades when you see a wick (and not price) is touching the limits of the RB, but then the price is lower than that, then unless it is a real trade, you can not know how many pips you make (positive or negative), you are only sure that pips made are lower if you win and bigger if you lose because you didn´t enter at the high/low of RB. Another problem with that is that you can not use limit orders, which is the best way to trade breakouts. Don´t misunderstand me, I´m not here saying your system is not good, I don´t know yet, I just want to make sure I understand how to enter trades. Cheers

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Look at chart please Caillou: Look at EURJPY 1h chart. See retrace zones an where are puts buy orders and after see basket chart. You can see now? If you dont want assume the slipagge at basket chart you can put limit orders at every single chart doing the same im doing now. But could be not all orders are execute.... This is a problem. I prefer will continue doing the same thing im doing untill now. But i accept sugestions. Regards.

Hi all: A new 1h RB is formed. Be cautious. Range is 550 pips. So large. Looking for enter buy position at 96.50. Target1 +550 pips. Still open: ba2: +1200 pips bb2: +900 pips Regards.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
What Currency pair is this?E/U G/U, G/J or what. When u talk of 550 pips are u talking about points or pips?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
It is a basket of currencies. (hence the thread title) Jaque use 14 pairs which I believe are... "GBPUSD", "EURUSD", "AUDUSD", "GBPJPY", "EURJPY", "AUDJPY", "EURGBP", "USDCHF", "NZDUSD", "USDJPY", "NZDJPY", "GBPCHF", "CHFJPY", "EURCHF" M.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi all: For all thats dont know what is a basket chart i say that is the addition of several currencies crosses. At this case the 14 pairs are that futurespec are saying. You can comprobate it easily. Look at one 1h bar range of a basket chart. i.e. 20:00 GMT. Say its range is 258 pips. Then look at the range of the same 1h bar in every pair and sum the numbers (28+18+15....). 14 pairs sum is same number than 1h bar at basket chart. Thats simple. Regards.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
ok I see thanks so much

--- 帖子 #254 ---
OK now I got thanks futurespec and jaquemate but is there a way you guys integrate all these pairs together and trade it at ones if yes how can do the same

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi sepramfx. Wellcome to thread. Im using scripts attached for enter buy or sell order. Script BuyAll open at same time 1 buy order in every pair untill 14. Script SellAll do the same. Every time you use the script you must enter a diferent Magic number in the script. The third script close all open position with the same Magic number. I give a magic number to every open position. i.e. Mn121220121 and add this number to comments. Then when i want close 14 open orders at same time but i dont want close all open orders i Know what is the magic number i must enter at script. Regards.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
back on the screen again. Previous pending order closed on red arrow, when I woke up after the Mas had crossed and the Ichi turned upwards. http://i.imgur.com/p7Tuj.png Regarding the EA, it opened many trades on demo and did really fine. Currently I need it mainly for opening trades because live screen time is limited. besides that there is always the MPTM EA running on a second chart handling any positions.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
The EA closes the determined percentage of positions on every touch of the Green Line, until finally closes it all at 0.01 lots.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
A job well done, keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Was this for long, short or both trade types? Was the exit line green or lime? What should happen is that once a trade is opened then the green exit line should appear at the opposite end of RB. (user can move line). Once a % is closed at the green line it should move further away (entry * 2 Rb) and turn lime (again user can move) M.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
GM All: Today i will continue looking for longs. First opportunity at LRB @102,60. Target1 +170 pips. Still open positions: ba2: +1450 pips. bb2: +1200 pips. Regards.

Request please :...... PLEASE do NOT post any more Q's re EA in this thread. Keep the thread clean as Jaque is doing a fantastic job trying to help provide a nice easy system for people to follow. If you have any issues with the EA that I posted then please PM me. (You should be using mnBag v1.1 and mn Bag EA v1.1) If I get time then I will reply and try and help if I can. NOTE: Jaque has posted the files that he uses and it would be best if you used them. My files were only posted originally following a request for something specific. M.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Ok. I add a new buy position i called bc1 and bc2. For clarificate that really i enter the orders and not only post entries i attached chart. I must say that this is demo account information. Im not trading with lots at live account. Im trading with microlots at live account. Every position i open my size is 14 pairs x 0.02 microlots = 2.8 minilots. Its a small position. Im only a retail trader. But think that you will go adding new positions and it increase size and i dont trade only this system. I must think at leverage too. 2 lots in combinated positions open is much money. Regards.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
for Natamoto .....;. Hopefully this is close to what you asked for. EA for basket trade placement and TP/SL. Creates 6 lines (hover over to see which is which). Set mPrs to number of pairs in your basket .. 14 by default. (If set to a lower number then will take the first x pairs from the list in order) "GBPUSD", "EURUSD", "AUDUSD", "GBPJPY", "EURJPY", "AUDJPY", "EURGBP", "USDCHF", "NZDUSD", "USDJPY", "NZDJPY", "GBPCHF", "CHFJPY", "EURCHF"}; The chart must have a corresponding number of pairs. Will not allow for hedging. AS ALWAYS .... try it and find any problems and if there are any report back to me by PM. USE ON DEMO ... ! Jaque .. sorry for littering your thread but it was a request from an earlier post. M. EDIT: Small error fixed, file updated 14.12.12

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi Futurespec, Much, much obliged that you could find time to do this and I will certainly try this out and let you know. Also, I am sorry Jaque but I have no intention to have any diversionary EA discussions on this marvellous thread...just looking for this tool which I hope others who also want to trade this manually will also find useful. I will post my results on a large live a/c that I am trading which will be greatly enhanced if the tool that future has provided does the job. Kind regards, N

Hi all: Position bc1-2 out at BE after a several drawdown bars and a spike of 400 pips against. Repit, closed at BE. This is the reason cause i dont put stop orders. There is a high percentage of posibilities that price retest entry level. Not all people understand this concept. This is a situation that can not manage by EA. I said any time that i have a risk limit but not depend of account size or percentage. For me depend of every trade and its global context. I dont see wicks for execute mental stop. I see closed bar. If closed bar transpassing limit i dont wait retrace and close at loss. At this case loss is so big but is compensating by previous BE. Open buy position bd1-2 at 99.80. Target1 +400.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi again: The 4 yellow lines are four risk limits i drawed for trade bc1-2. I dont explain now why but you can especulate with it and say what do you think. May seem complicated but no. Its easy of understand. Any bar closed below this lines. Regards.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
GM Jaque, Think that you must be smiling again this week. With you highlighting potential trades in advance no one can accuse you of 'fixing' the results. Excellent work, keep it up :-) M.

GM futurespect. Yes i said several post ago. When a trend start and you can ride it could pay you for a time.... But i wish that is not finished yet.After this trend could be a range time and a loss or BE in a row. Most times happens. Thanks for cumpliments. Im not interesting in show results. Only want to show how i trade. It is my personal way. Untill this moment i only show a simple system for entries based on price retrace to supports/resistances. A RBL or RBH in a barket chart is a support/resistance zone in a single pair chart. I want to show all possible entries but all entries are no good. I have my own criteria for take or not an entrie and my own MM. I only can show it but after this every trader must addapt to his own way of trading. Its my thought. All the best futurespec. Regards.

Well: Today Im looking for longs. But i dont taked the first day opportunity at RBL. If you look at 4h chart you can see that a new RB is formed. Most times when a RB is formed the next bar retrace until low or near. This is the reason cause is possible that in a 1h chart another RB with a lower low is formed more near clouds. This morning i closed position bd1 at target: +450 when i opened my computer. Still open positions: ba2: +1500 bb2: +1250 bd2: +450 Regards.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Ok. I was waiting for present 4h bar touched 4h LRB and formed a new 1h RB with a lower low. Now 1h RB is formed. I enter at LRB at confluence with EMA and Clouds. Enter position be1-2. Target 1: +310. Yellow lines are my three zones of risk limit for this trade. If you look carefully you can discover the reason why these lines are drawed. Regards.

Hi all: I attached an indicator very useful thats show at chart profit open orders in pips and money, and pips @ money in closed trades last week. I hope help you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi all: I will update my situation. Better see chart attached please. Still open at profit ba2 @ bb2. Today: bd1 closed at +450. bd2 closed at +100. Stil open at loss be1-2. Regards

--- 帖子 #276 ---
If you are following this thread may be you can speculate now with the next trade. I like that you post now what you wil do looking at present Down RB and where it closed. I would like all mates post their analisis please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Suppose someone needs to be shot first ;-) Daily still strong 4hr at support 1hr closing below support Not looking for longs currently. Wait to see if 4hr holds. Could be tempted to send out some early short scouts. M.

Looks to be Range bound Double CCI Woody signalling possible change 1hr chart Stay on sidelines until 1hr chart take a firm new direction with price action below Ichi

--- 帖子 #279 ---
20+ people been watching the thread and only 1 other reply !!! There are no wrong answers, just your opinions that we would all like to see and possibly learn from. Jaque has done his bit ... how about some encouragement? M.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
it seems that the 4H low Range bound is strong resistance level confluence with MA and ichi. if it was not friday, buy would be low risk. in 1H the buy at 101.42 is BE. http://i.imgur.com/ClKJL.png

--- 帖子 #281 ---
There has been an issue with partial closing of trades using mn Bag EA, Hopefully this cures that (if not let me know) M.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
There is this script that retrieves open orders by magic number, so it is easier to mange them using EA's When opening an order, use for magic number date and time values (ddmmhhmm), ie 14121650 for now. I hope its useful.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
testing goes on. entered demo short at 102.6 on the 1H as per rules and waiting for the 4H upper bound touch NOT as per rules. http://i.imgur.com/NRoyA.png

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi all and thanks for participate guys. I like your analisis. Im agree with futurespec. There is no wrong way. If you win your interpretation is good. Thats all. First all i update: Closed buy position be1-2 at BE. Daily chart say UP. 4h chart say UP. 1h chart say UP. But the rule say that when 1h bar closed above/below clouds then trend could be change. Although trend at higher time frame is UP all big trend start always with a small trend in lower time frame. Could be this the start of a new DOWN trend?. I still open buy positions ba2 and bb2. Both are reached +1000 pips average. Its a good moment to ¿hedging?..... ¿diversificate?.... i dont know the correct word. If i respect the rule i must enter a sell 2 positions. This 2 positions and 2 buy positions open are hedging. If price go UP then close this sell position at BE or minimal loss but 2 away buy positions still growing to...... If price go DOWN then i close one and the other buy position at profit but Sell positions still growing to...... If i dont probe i never know. Regards.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Only just noticed that somewhere along the way the zone lines got changed to all aqua ....... amended so that the shorts should now be red again. M.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Ok. Sell positions sb1-2 out at BE. Come back to look for longs at LRB. I understand that this is a bit tedious but most important thing is to probe and to minimize loss. Two probes, two BE, zero loss. Thats important thing for me. Regards.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi all. This is a good week. I hope next week trend UP will continue. I wish all people have a nice weekend and specially to guys that participate in this thread. All the best. Regards.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
GM all: Today i will looking for longs. A new 1h RB is formed but i dont enter at Low. A new 4h RB is formed too and price could be retrace to Low around 105.90. When a Gap happens most times price retrace to last price before gap. At this case at zone marked. Its possible that a new lower RB at 1h chart is formed. I will wait to enter around 105.90 at rectangle zone at EMA and clouds confluence. Still open positions: ba2: +1700 bb2: +1500 I encorage all mates to post his analisis. There is no problem with it. Im sure that participation is positive for all. Regards.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
GM Jaque, all, Agree with your point about gap but have taken the RbL on 1hr (demo) May come back a little and you would be more prudent but I still see the 4hr range having been broken and now acting as support. Time will tell. M.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi every one, Yes, it may fill the gap

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Well. I new RB is formed. I look for longs at Low. Target1 +250 pips. If you taked previous buy position you have several options: 1) Close position at close bar assuming -30 pips loss. 2) Wait to retrace. Close to BE and wait for another oportunitie at new RB. 3) Dont close position assuming that price will continue UP and assuming more risk. Regards.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Well. Im long. Enter 2 buy position around 104.50. Position called be1-2. Target1 +250. Still open positions ba2 and bb2. Look at EURJPY chart and see where is put the order. Gap is completed. Regards.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
assume you mean 104.50

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Ok. 104.50. Thanks for correction. Regards.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Well. Target1 reached. Closed position be1 at +250. Still open positions ba2, bb2 and be2. Regards.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
GM All: Today i will looking for longs. If you taked last buy trade at LRB you exit at BE. Now im looking to buy at LRB around 106. Still open positions: ba2: +1800 bb2: +1550 be2: +350 Regards.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi all: I attached an indicator very useful that shows for every pair open positions and profit in money. Its possible to modificate for attached at chart and add a column that shows profit in pips?. This is my question. Regards.

GM futurespec: Thanks for work.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks futurespect: I hope see you smail too and the other mates. Now we are collecting. Tomorrow nobody knows. Good afternoon mate.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Well: i will continue looking for longs at new LRB. Closed position bf1 at closed bar in +250 pips (i wasnt infront computer and when i come back i see price above HRB. I has good luck). Still open positions: ba2: +2000 bb2: +1750 be2: +500 bf2: +350 Nodoby taked any position today?. You can post please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Futurespec: I do not want to abuse you but I have a question. Feel free for answer. There is no problem. Its possible add to your indicator that shows RB lines an alert when price is near this lines?... i.e 20, 30 pips?. I think it could be very very useful. Regards.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
GM All: Today I will continue looking for longs. Still open positions: ba2: +2200 bb2: +1950 be2: +700 bf2: +550 Regards.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Well. A new RB is formed. I look enter at LRB around 110. Target1: +230. Regards.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Jaque, Think this should do it (not tested) Will only alert once / Rb mDist is distance from RbH/L M.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi all: I attached a chart that shows actual trend and all open and closed trades from the start. I marked a zone for help you to identificate one thing that a want to show. My questions are the next. Looking at chart. Can you see diversification trades?. Can you see importance of diversificación to keep open trades for a long time?. Think in it please and comment. Regards.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Down Rb's on 14th &amp; 18th (closed below cloud and Ma) could potentially be start of new downtrend so diversify here to protect already opened positions. This has been a good run up and must end eventually ( but who knows when?) ... so be prepared. Great ongoing info Jaque, thank you. M.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
It really is well done, you have conquered this trend and its amazing to see to see how well your Ichimoku (5,10,20) has performed with the range Bar idea. Very Well Done

--- 帖子 #316 ---
GM futurespec: Thanks one more time. Very useful. Regards.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thank you futurespec. Are you taking any trade?. Regards.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
GM lucklogic: Thanks for compliments. Ichimoku gives you the trend. RB gives you the zone entry. A good MM gives you the rest. Thats all. Its simple. Not easy but simple. I repeat again. You practice and practice and comment please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi, Please see the attached chart showing the 1Hr range bars (after work by Squalor) with a tradition Ichimoku chart( 9,26,52) This shows that there are successful variations possible too Of course this methodology would also work with less Pairs (for use with less well funded accounts)

--- 帖子 #320 ---
No, no trades today. Only 1 left open @ 91.95 from 11th. Expecting a correction soon but will wait to see what market dictates. May wait for a retest of 4hr RbL M.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi futurespec, mn Bag v1.1 lines doesn't appear when I use core506 offline. I put c5offline indicator on GBPJPY pair as a basic pair What may be the problem? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #322 ---
no idea, sorry. The indi was made for my own use with the initial idea being that I do NOT need to use offline charts. Don't know what core506 is but suspect it uses 5 pairs which my indi does not currently do. If you let me know what the 5 pairs are I may do a temp fudge1 If you do an object search for mHozBS.... I expect you will find some M.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Yes as you know c5 offline indi uses 5 pairs AUDJPY, EURJPY, NZDUSD, GBPUSD, GBPJPY By using c5offline indi instead of Bascetv6, core506 appears instead of #kos# on offline charts Where can I find mHozBS ?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hello Jaque, Can you clarify why you don' go only on sell side on pink circles, in reference of your first post ? Thks Tof

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Samad, Now this is where I start to get annoyed again and stop coding!! (I'm temperamental like that ;-) ) I cannot be coding changes every 5 mins to cater for every whim &amp; fancy. Right at the outset I said "Use it or bin it" Try this. M.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
No, it is the same.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
back again after 3 days. looking for a possible bounch at 109.30-110.30 level. Lower band of 4h RB, previous 1H RB and previous 4H lower high also (yellow boxes). I don't think that the current 1h RB will hold. http://i.imgur.com/uqRiI.png

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi all: Price is aproximate to RBL. You have two options: a) Enter a Buy position. b) Dont take the trade. Wait to retrace to 4h RBL around 109.50. What do you do and why?. Please comment. Regards.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Samad, Ask Jaque ... he has it working on offline I believe. Did you set mPairsUsed (the number of pairs) to 5

--- 帖子 #330 ---
It is the same again! No problem. Thanks anyway. I would use Bascetv6.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Samad, what value do you have showing on your chart for the last bar? Did you do a search for the object?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
there are quite big discrepancies on the readings of different TF charts. take a look below, the last 4 hours low on 1m (112,17), 1H(111,75), 4H (110.45). almost 200 pips. Serious drawback on backtesting. The same happens with offline charts. http://i.imgur.com/RRwuh.png

--- 帖子 #333 ---
why do you expect the value of last 1m to be same as last 1hr/4hr? ... cannot be the 1m is within the 1hr and the 1hr is within the 4hr.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
.......the last 4 hours low on 1m (112,17), 1H(111,75), 4H (110.45).

--- 帖子 #335 ---
entered two positions at 110. waiting the 109.30 for another two.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
109.3 triggered

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Well. this is the bar i was waiting. A big 450 pips 1h down bar thats touch 4h RBL. Im looking for buy enter at RBL. Target1 +450. This is an interesting situation. If a bar touch RBL and then go up but close inside range and below clouds... we are in a trend change and we must look for sells positions?. Are you ok?.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Samad Did you .. Right click on chart/objects list .... can you see a list of trendlines named mHozBS(with number after) If you can double click on one and check the parameter values. If none there then can you send me the MQ4 file for whatever you are using to generate the charts but should not be this as you are using offline charts I believe. M.

For those that requested the indi for different/fewer pairs try the attached (use indi v1.3 and EA v1.3 together). The pairs in the indi list and the EA list MUST be set the same (that is down to you if you decide to change them) If you want to change the pairs list on a chart then remove the EA first, change the indi, then reattach the EA. M. EDIT: 19:15 ... indi modded to allow text comment to be removed (as requested)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thank you ...........great work

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Futurespec, After trying a lot, I can't find how be success to have same picture as you with our indi. I put it on GBPJPY 1H but I have always GBPJPY curve wich stay on chart with basket candle. Can you give me how proceed to have only basket on chart, you can send template if this is faster for you. Thks a lot for your help. Tof.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
You have to adjust the chart scale , open the chart properties and adjust the chart scale to correspond with the numbers that are displayed on the top left of your chart. Futurespec explained all this when he offered us this indicator to use.. I now understand why great minds give up on forums as they get asked questions time and time again that have already been answered............ Please read the thread !!!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thks I have read all the thread before and I tried this solution without success. I will try again. Thks;

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hello Jaquemate and all, I was a basket-ting lover years back but faded out due to lack of practical method to trade. You have now introduced a very interesting Range Bar method. Thanks for sharing. Will be following closely and hope to contribute with forward results in future. Keep up the great work. Akira

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Using kos' Basket V6 and then Futurespec's Mn Bag v1.1 I have set up a H1 and a H4 chart. Then I went through a listed all the legitimate trades as I understand Jaquemates' rules. And I have come to the following conclusion. To me it doesn't seem to be worth taking the long trades if the market is above the Ichi and the current RB is lower than the previous on. Then on short trades below the Ichi I feel it is better to avoid taking the trades if the current RB is higher that the last. Here are my results. H1 All trades total pips 1093 23 trades av 47.5 9:14 win/loss 39% Or excluding the above 1019 17 60 7:10 41% Then H4 6210 41 151 21:21 49% 5610 29 193 16:13 55% So by taking all the trades more money can be made but a lot of pain from losing trades can be avoided by not taking the trades that I am talking about. Bob

--- 帖子 #350 ---
By adjusting the chart scale, according to Rbh&amp;Rbl numbers, my problem solved too. Now, I have the same chart as futurespec's Thanks ianp Thanks futurespec Thanks Jaquemate

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Short was taken on H1 at retrace within the range. All JPY pairs. This is manual entry just to get the feel of the method. Will try EA eventually. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Ianp ... thanks :-) Samad .. pleased you got there eventually. Re v1.3 Just to make it clear for those that wish to play with different numbers of pairs.... It is OK to leave a pair name in all 14 pairs. Leave set at 14 and it works alongside the 14 pairs that Jaque is using, If you have say set 3 pairs then the first 3 pairs in the list will be worked on; set 5 pairs, first 5 pairs in list etc, etc. You can set the pair names in the list to what you want so if you want core 5 then set the first 5 pairs in the list ( in BOTH v1.3 indi AND v1.3 EA ) to your core5 pairs. Put the EA onto the chart AFTER the indi pairs have been set. HTH M. EDIT: The EA is not needed (the indi will run by itself) but is there as an assistant for placing trades. It is not foolproof ... you need to use common sense.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
GM All: Wellcome to thread bobha. I thanks your stadistical. Great work. But i dont understand some dates. What is backtest period?. You talks about 1000 pips if a im right. So small amount. So you talk about avoid take some trades. Well. If you can you must backtest last one...two years (i.e.). Take all trades lossers and study the next questions: What is average MAE of all lossing trades?. In what percentage of this lossing trades price come back to entry price and close at BE?. The answer to this questions could clarificate you what is better. If take all possible trades agree with trend direction and analyzing the global context for every trade........ or avoid some trades. Thats simple. After this you decide what is your critery and trade accordingly. I must say too that this system is not good for EA. All trades are not good but only practice can gives you the answer. Its so dificult to backtest. Rules are always the same but rules are only a starting point... no the system itself. Regards.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Risingsun. Wellcome to thread and thanks for compliments. I anime you to post your trades and colaborate. Regards.

Hi all: Apologize but today im very busy and i cant post when i want. Look at chart attached. It resumen all possibles. I repeat...possibles trades from last post. Its logical that i dont take all this trades. Normally im not infront computer at 23:00 GMT but depends. I want to show all possible trades if you follow the rules strictly. Most important thing is to undertand the system principles. Regards.

the indi was not designed for metals. Check the objects list on the chart and see what level m.HozBS..... are set at.

EDIT: Cannot see from you pic but check what values are in top left of screen ...I imagine that they are possibly 2900 or of that order.... you need to set the chart scale to match that.

Merry Christmas and A Successful Pip filled year to all , Jaque, futurespec, special wishes for ya two, have a wonderful time

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Merry Christmas to all the participants in this thread and I wish for a great vacation time. I'd like to make some comments regarding the EA provided by futurespec, which might worth be fixed (if possible!!) First to mention that the EA is really a pro tool. of very little importance a. Be very careful when dropping the EA to a chart, especially when the current candle is beyond the trigger line because it opens the basket on the spot. Maybe the trigger could be set some hundreds pips away and adjusted manually. b.When the chart is closed and reopened (by mistake or somehow anyway) the EA continues to track the trades, but it does not, if it is removed and re-added even with the magic numbers set correctly. c. Stop loss line missing d. I think this one is very important and if could be fixed, it would save a serious amount of pips. As seen in T101 offline trader by john wustrack, when the trigger is hit, the order turns from limit to stop, so the basket opens when the market retraces (hopefully) to the original trend and of course will probably not open (great probability in a big dump) if the market go against, saving a possible loss.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
as002 a. That should not happen?? When attached to chart the entry lines are not active UNTIL the triangle is moved. b. Just tried that and worked ok for me?? c. Did not want a stop loss line As originally explained it was just an aid to place the basket of trades at the opposite end of the Rb and then set the exit at the other end of the Rb. It is not, and was not intended to be, foolproof. The entry/exit lines are moveable for manual intervention. d. Not familiar with T101, sorry, and not sure what you are asking for. (the idea is to enter at the opposite end of the Rb, nothing else) M.

GM All: Return from short holidays this week i will looking for longs at 1h chart. At Daily chart i can see how price breakout bearish trend line drawed and closed above it. For me now we are in an UP trend again. At 4h chart i see bars above ichimoku confirming bullish trend. Regards-

--- 帖子 #369 ---
At 1h chart attached i marked with arrows two yesterdays possible longs entries at RBL. These are false touches. Price never touch RBL and i dont take this entries. Most times i take an entry when i see price touch line and commonly wick exceed line. Although most important is buy at RBL zone is better to wait price touch really line. When we are talking about a 500 pips RB we are looking for 500 pips target1 and 30 pips slippagge is not important. But when you are taking a 150 pips RB you must think that 30 pips slippagge is important cause is a high loss % and if you add another 30-40 pips of spread then you are reducing at 40% your profit posibilities. If you take todays entry congratulations you are reached target1. I dont take this entry. Today i only keep ba2 position at +2300 pips. Regards.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Ok. A new RB is formed. Im looking for longs at RBL but if you see at 4h chart is possible that current 4h bar becomes a new RB and price retest low around 110. I prefer buy to 110 zone at EMA and Ichimoku confluence. Target1 +300 pips. Regards.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
good morning to all of you. the D1 is strong, but it probably will not cross the previous 4H high at once. a buy at the 110 - 110.5 seems secure enough. even if it goes south it will most probably make a bounce and get out with out loss. http://i.imgur.com/8EvyR.png

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Well. I opened buy bi1-2 position at white line around 111.75 at EMA confluence. Target1: +400 pips. Regards.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Ok. I closed bi1-2 position at BE at retest RBL. I will looking for longs at new RBL. Target1: +600. I remember all. One of most important things is to probe and minimize loss when price go against you cause more early or late you trade will go with you so far and it pay you for all previous fails probes. Regards.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Well. A new attemp. Buy at RBL at confluence with 4h RBL. Position bj1-2. Target1: +600. Regards.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Jaquemate, at what price did you enter? I had a pending buy at 109.72 but it did not trigger, although the 1H 18:00 and 4H 16:00 (orange candle) seems to have gone further down. The 1M charts which seems to be the most accurate chart fot the 14 basket did, a low at 109.95 as shown at the chart. Maybe the orders should be placed 30-40 pips away from the RB bands? http://i.imgur.com/TFDZP.png

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi as002. I enter around 109.90 at 5m chart that you will see. Efectly most times price dont touch RBB and i wait for price touch and wicks excedeed bands. In this case in my chart price touched RBL. Your 1m chart is the same that mine. Im now +380 pips. I talked about this at several previous post. Regards.

GM All: Today i will looking for longs at new RBL. Target1: +380. This morning i closed position bj1 at Target1: +700. as002: You taked this trade finally?. Still open positions: ba2: +2750 bj2: +650 Regards.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Ok. I enter position bk1-2 at 113.70. Target1: +400. Regards.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Ok. Price go against me -100 pips now. If current down bar closed below previous RB and below Ichimoku forming a new RB i will do the next: 1) Wait for Close position bk1-2 at BE. 2) Diversificate selling at new RBH position sa1-2. Still open position ba2. Regards.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Now ba2 position is at +2350 pips. At past this position reached +2500 pips and then go down untill 1600. Again MFE reached +2850 pips. For me to close a trade at profit below 50% of MFE is a deficient management of trade. I search reached at least 65% of MFE. If i cant diversificate and price will continue down forming a new Down RB i will close this position around +2300 pips. This amount is 80% of MFE (2850). For me is enought. This could be a good moment to close this trade if i cant diversificate. Regards.

Excellent trade buddy Profit Locking is the best method... and with ur multiple baskets strategy its more simplified.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi Max. Nice to talk you today. Thanks. I attached two charts thats explain all. At 4H chart you can see how last down bar break up trend line and close below. Usually when it happens price retrace and retest trend line. I hope that touch white line at confluence between trend line. Round number 114.000 and 50% fibonacci. If you look at 1h chart you can see that 114.000 is entry price of actual trade. I hope close here at BE. Regards.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Took it on the demo. On the live acc I had a buy at 109.72 and it did no go that far.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Ok i closed bk1-2 position at BE with a minimum profit: +80 pips. Still open 2 buy positions yet. Regards.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Be cautious with live account please. Always there is risk in trading. Can i ask you how do you management in demo this trade?. Regards.

--- 帖子 #386 ---

Happy New Year 2013 to all the Basket traders, wonderful +ve pip is all that i wish you all this year...My special thanks goes to Jaq for this unique RB L/H manner of trading the basket.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
are we waiting till the 7 jan to trade

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I think I might have a mental blockage I have read the thread twice and have just loaded basket v6 indicator I then went to the off line files and opened the kos indicator ie 1 hour The chart came up no problem with a range bar of 550 My question is This chart is off line so there is no movement so how do we know when the top of the range bar is met so we can sell ie my sell would be approx 127.75

--- 帖子 #396 ---
The offline chart receives ticks from live chart where you loaded Basket6 indie... u need to have that chart open all the time for the offline chart to function.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Thanks Max Pain I have resolved the problem I had an indicator Balance line db which I think was hogging the updates .Removed this indicator and now is working 100%

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hello all, Please be informed that there is a sell opportunity i am going for @ 124.32 what do you think Jaq?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi all: Apologize but i cant post last days cause im in holidays untill next tuesday. However sometimes i was monitoring my opening positions. Regards.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi ejikz. Wellcome to thread. All questions are wellcome. Im on holidays now but i reply to you by courtesy. i attached a 1h chart and it dosnt looks like your. As clarification i must say that in my chart im apply 10 pips how setting to consider a new RB. I think you are appling 14 that i said several post early. Daily and 4h chart trend for me is UP but i will be cautious the next days. All big trend always start with a small move at lower time frames. At my chart, and apply strictly rules you must sell around 128 level. But this move could be only a retrace inside big UP trend and price are only completing gap. Nobody knows. But if you are short at 124.32 it could be a good entry too. If you take target1 then move open positions to BE for segurity. If price go down this days it could be great. Sure. Regards.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi Jaquemate, Apologize mi for interrupting you in holidays, very interesting system, Can you post current screenshot of EU pair (1 HR and especially from 2nd Jan) to check where and which possible trade/entry exit occurred. Please.. Regards, Joyy.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Sorry Jaquemate,I got it,no need to post ,it's a #kos#14chart... Regards

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi Jaquemant I hope you have good holiday. Could you post your latest template (with sup and res indicator) Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi smartvin. Wellcome to thread. I attached template i use for 1h chart. Regards.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thanks for quick reply Jaquemate

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi All: If you follow this thread you know that i talked often to wait to BE when you are in loss assuming an addicional potencial risk. But nobody question why im doing it. I dont have time to test for long time and show results but its easly checking. I show a bit dates sample of last two months. I know thats is bit, yes, but if you have more time than me you can test it. In last two months have been formed 145 RB. There have been 87 potencial trades on this 145 RB (60%). The results are as follows: 38 Winners (43,68%). 49 Lossers (56,32%). But in 44 from this 49 trades price retest at least one time entry level (89,80%). Then we have following results. 38 Winners (53,68%). 44 BE (50,57%). 5 Lossers (5,75%). I think that is better to wait for price retest entry level assuming that when a loss happens it could be more than if you close a trade when 1h bar close out RB entry against you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Well. After a holidays week i return to trade today. January´s 2 i closed all open buy positions at profit. ba2 Closed at +4300 pips. bj2 Closed at +2300 pips. Today i taked 2 trades. Enter ba1/2 position and closed at BE. At recent RB i enter sa1/2 position. sa1 closed at target1 at +200 pips. sa2 still open at +300 pips now. Regards.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
HI Jaquemate, thanks for yours kindness in contributing this strategy. I have been study this for one month ago, however, i have a question, Is that you monitor the forex every minutes for most of the time when you trade? Do you find pending order is better than we manually monitor for the entry of trade? Do you use pending? Regards, darren

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi darrenwee549. Wellcome to thread. Im not infront computer all day, only when im at office. I dont need stay all time infront computer. I monitoring chart and when i see that price is near RB lines i go to 5m timeframe and wait to price touch level i drawed. I use pending orders to trade single crosses but i dont use for basket trading. I dont know how its possible to do it at every single chart when price touch RB levels at basket chart. Sure its possible if a programmer do it but i cant do it now. I wait for price touch RB levels and enter at market using script attached several post ago. I hope help you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Jaquemate could you explain me how to avoid this type of trade. I loose 162 pip's

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi Jaques, This EA can be used to trade a basket, you can use limit and stop orders so you can place the order and laeve it to enter. You could use 2 EAs's and schange the magic numbers so one would take profit and the other could be left to run. Tha EA I have attached is for a 5 pair basket but I am sure there is a 14 pair one on the KOS or T101 thread. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi smartvin. You could do what Jaq suggested a couple of posts back. Don't close out on the close outside the range bar as was the original idea. Wait for a couple of more bars and close at B.E. when the price gets back to your entry point. Jaq had 39 out of 44 trades do this in the two months he tested. I tried the same thing on a H4 chart over the past 7 months and 16 out of 19 potential loses became B.E's. Bob

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi smartvin: bobha is wright. -162 pips is not a big loss. Its an av. 12 pips x cross. You must think that you are looking for 2000-3000 pips reward with second position. I close first position at target1 cause i need to replenish my capital and cover this potencial loss. Think that if average target1 is i.e. 300 pips... 160 pips loss really is no big. You can do two things. First, close trades at loss when a bar close against you forming a new RB. Then you have an average loss of -150 pips x position. Or Wait to price retest entry level and close at BE or with a minimal loss. say 50 pips. Then you close at BE 90% of lossers trades and the other 10% your average loss could be -350-400 pips. You decide. I prefer wait to BE. But it requires a mental exercise. At demo its easy do it but in live no. Wait for next 3, 4, 5 hours sometimes to price retest entry level is hard but it happens 90% of time. When dont happens this 10% of time... one option is to close trade when then second RB against you is forming. Loss could be -350-400 pips average but i repeat, it happens only 10% of time. At trade you are show my price go below entry level and you can closed it at BE. At 5m chart white line is entry level at round number. Regards.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi ianp: thanks. I probe it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Well. We are in a range market and its possible for a couple of days but i must to probe. I enter minutes ago ba1/2 position around 124.70 at arrow. Target1 370 pips. Regards.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Ok. i closed ba1/2 at BE. Waiting for longs again at new RBL. Regards.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hello Jaq, My trading signal still give me Sell option , due to the fact that the 4 Hr bias is still fully under Ichimoku, as shown by the picture, i am targeting 600pips from my entry point @ 125.50 thank you

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi ejikz: Im agree with you. 1h chart say UP but price is inside Ichimoku showing indecision. 4H chart say DOWN. At Daily chart i see a big RB that closed below previous RB and for the moment its means a sideways time and a BE in a row. But if you take a good entry when price breakout this range you make easily 2000 or more pips. I hope it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Thank you jaq for always being there with good support for fellow traders. I wish you the best of Pipping

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi ejikz. Thanks. I forget to say another thing about trade this system in 4h or higher time frame. 4h TF is very slow. If you take a trade and price go against you... you must wait untill 4h bar close.... and wait again to price retest entry level. 1h TF is enougth fast but dont stressfull. Think about it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi All: Nobody taked this trade?. +1400 pips untill now... Regards.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Dear Jaquemate, I have been watching this thread sometimes, and have three questions: 1. There is no engulfed candle in the chart quoted which has touched LRB. So there should be no trade here? 2. Also several posts talk about having no SL. But in your post #1 chart#2 you do mention that if the 1H candle after the entry point closes below LRB (in an uptrend), the position should be closed. So that then is the standard definition of a SL? 3. I am comparing your method to the very popular PeterCrowns DIBS (Daily Inside Bar Setup) with which you must be familiar DIBS judges a daily trend by market price being above/below DO (Daily Open) which is the same as last daily close (if there are no gap ups, especially Monday morning). DIBS method then says that if the price breaks above the inside bar, buy as long as the price is above DO. And if the price falls below low of the inside bar (IB), sell. SL is the other side of the IB. So your method is comparable, except that you judge a longer term trend first (via Ichi etc), and then look at a retracement from the LRB (outside or range bar) for an uptrend. Vice versa for a retracement from URB (outside or range bar high) for a sell. Roughly then, you have a Retrace HOBS (hourly or 4H outside bar setup) as opposed to the Breakout DIBS method. Both methods rely heavily on stacking (continuous buy/sells in the same direction at higher/lower prices until the trend exhausts), per the equity millipede thread arguments. Any comments? Interestingly, even though HOBS and DIBS are essentially opposing, their statistical returns look high ! This makes me wonder if the real method is the ability to judge if a certain trend will continue, and then to keep stacking. Surely your HOBS method adds to the other (retracement) side of DIBS. The trend is your friend, with either breakouts or retracements.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi atharmian and thanks for questions. Im so buy now and I will answer later but i only want answer you to point 1 question. At the trade you are talking about 1h RBL price is 123.20. If you look at 5m chart you could be taked this trade buying around 123.15-123.20 when 5m price formed a new RB and the next bar touched this RBL. And how clarificate i must say that i dont take this trade cause i dont stay at office at this moment. If i taked i +2000 pips now. Regards.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Jaquemate, Thanks. Maybe you can offer more detail on this trade later, as one has to know what TF charts to watch at what times Will wait for your other answers. Happy trading ... Athar.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
[quote=atharmian;6356617]Dear Jaquemate, 2. Also several posts talk about having no SL. But in your post #1 chart#2 you do mention that if the 1H candle after the entry point closes below LRB (in an uptrend), the position should be closed. So that then is the standard definition of a SL? Ok. i have a minute to ask this question. When i talked about no SL im saying that i dont use SL orders for this systems. Most traders put stop orders at predefined price. At generally i dont like stop loss orders and particularity at basket trading if you do it youll be out of market with a loss 90% of time. For me is not idoneus. Then how do you do for manage a loss?. Using for exit the same principle that you use for entry. When a candle close against you forming a new RB. It could be only a retrace or a new trend start. You dont know and only you can do is close the trade assuming loss. But in basket trading a particularity thing happens. 90% of time price retrace to entry price and you can wait for it and close at BE 90% of lossers trades. Today is an example. I taked a buy trade 2h ago and now i closed with +110 pips after wait to retrace. You must know too that if you wait to retrace there is a 10% of chance that price dont retrace to entry price and will continue go against you increasing loss. At this case you are assuming more risk at specifical trade and you must close this trade when price forme another RB assuming this addicional loss. I hope help you with this question. Regards.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Great answer, thanks. I now recall you said the same much earlier as well Athar. [quote=Jaquemate;6357471]

Dear friends, I'm just a newbie thus have less experience in this field. However, I have joined FF to enrich my knowledge about how to be profitable in this business. I have been reading many threads and I came across this trading methodology. My question is can we use the strategy in trading a currency pair, not those in the basket but just one pair among them. I haven't explored yet if this is available in my platform. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi Aemilliann: Wellcome to thread and thanks for question. Im trading with mt4 plattform. I like your question cause im working several days ago extrapolating the basket chart entries in a currency chart and testing results. Basically my conclusion is that you can do it in a single chart with success but obvously results are not same. I dont like add indicators working how filters but at this case i think that its positive add indicator im working now how filter. Dont filtering entries but decreasing position size. I will post it. Regards.

Ok dont be impatient please. Its question of time. Im sorry. Regards

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Well. Following with the very good question of Aemiliann i attached 2 charts. One: 1h Basket Chart. You can see all RB formed. Two: 1h EURJPY (i love this pair). Can you see all RB formed?. Forget gray horizontal lines drawed, its assian session. If you have a bit of time you can do this exercise. Draw all RB that you think and all possible entries. After this you look to both charts and conclusions. You can post here please and attached charts. Regards.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
These are all possible todays trades. Regards.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I have marked the Range Bars in the attachment. Thus if we know the trend, we can enter position say buy if the price goes above the high of the Range Bar.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Aemilliann. Well done. Its mine chart. You can see the entries at RBL. Regards.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Thanks Jaquemate. So we must be sure that we know the direction of the trend so that we can enter at those RBs. This still affords us entry even though we are not able to catch the start of the breakout.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
hallo everybody. back again waiting for a short at 147 level, at confluence of MA's and upper RB bound. 1M dotted lines are the RB http://i.imgur.com/HMB7K.png

hallo jaq, i missed it for 45 pips . was not in front of screen. I need to start placing orders 50 pips inside RB what pairs are you trading? edit: EURJPY, sorry did not see http://i.imgur.com/FscDY.png

--- 帖子 #439 ---
what indi you use to paint the RBars?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Dont worry mate. -45 pips is nothing. Its -3 pips x pair. I trade EURJPY today. Its better you look for enter at round numbers 0.50 or 0.00 above RBH for sell and below RBL for buy. Price go to this levels often. Regards and good luck.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I dont use any indicator for the moment. Any programmer?.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
In this entry price dont touch RBH but 147.000 is a good entry.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
This is HA filter im probing now for entries. but no for take or not an entry. Only for increase position size You can go to 4h chart and look bars. Regards.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi Jaquemate. I want to clarify something regarding range bars. Is it better to just consider the bodies of the candle or the wicks also? There are some instances that the wicks are included in the range but not the real bodies?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi Aemillian. Bodies and wicks are RB. If you dont consider wicks results are not the same. Spreads kill you. More RB. More entries. More time infront PC. More stressfull. More Profit?. At market trend you capture profit but in a sideways market...... Look at chart please. Regards.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi all. These are the possibles entries for today. Regards.

New RB is forming. looking only for shorts. It may go to 130 (D1- target1) but before that a rebound to 144.4-145.8 (1H-4H range) is possible. Really nice setup for short if it comes true. should morning 2nd basket had opened, would be BE. Waiting............. http://i.imgur.com/I0WJp.png

Good Morning fellow Range Bar Traders, I just borrow some additional ideas from KOS tread to add to my Range trading techniques, i hope Jaq will not see this as offensive to his own tread. Addition of 2 separate Has settings ( to the 1 hr chart)+ the RB H/L idea is what i feel i need now to bust my confidence in trading the Basket. Please find attached my idea of next entry @ 146.50 targeting 400pips and let the other run out by itself. Thanks Jaq

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi ejikz. No problem. All coments are wellcome. Sure. This modification dont change RB concept. I said days ago that you must look for every way to determine trend and to trade comfortable. If you look to Ichimoku &amp; HA charts you see so much similitudes. Only two coments for you. 1. What are HA settings?. 2. I see in your chart a very very low spread (5.8). Is it correct?. Then what is your broker?. My av.spread for 14p is 40. Regards.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
@ Jaq The Has setting i am using are 2,15,2,15 and 2,55,2,55 As for the spread of 5.8, it was just the spread of 6 running pairs i presently have on the live account i got the pix from. Thank you once again Jaq for showing me how to Fish by myself

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Thansk to you ejik. Im happy if you make live money.... Ok. I dont like complicated things and i dont like to add indicators how filter. Hoewer i think that its a system improvement. Time will say. I attached two charts explaining how works 4h HA indicator im probing how filter to determine position size of every trade. There are two scenarios. 1. When you have an open position in a direction and 4h HA close at contrarian direction. How to do then. 2. When you dont have an open position and 4h HA close at contrarian direction that your biass. I hope help you to improvement the system. Regards.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I forgot say that when you have open 2 positions cause position 1 dont reached target1 yet.... and 4h HA change... you must close 1 position (normally at profit) and leave 2nd position free. Dont move SL at BE. You are increasing 50% your risk and you have a bit profit too. Leave free position and wait for happens. If 2nd position close at loss you are increasing 50% your risk. If position come back to main trend you can capture largest profit. I hope you understand me. Regards.

Hello Friends, I am going in to take a Buy trade @ 151.50 looking to take 1st profit @ 450pips and let the other trade run. find attached my observation.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi all: Good luck mate but at this trade price is looking for 4hRBL. I think that you could have a -250 DD before to stay at profit. Look 4h chart. For me is better to wait 4H RBL and buy around 149-149.50. If you loss this trade and price retest entry level you can close 1 position to BE and leave 2nd position still open to see what happens increasing 50% risk. For me trend will continue UP. Regards.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Thank you Jaq for the insight

--- 帖子 #466 ---
From wednesday +2250 pips UP..... at 2 days..... So much. . Today is friday. Friday = retracement day. Or not.......

--- 帖子 #467 ---
@ Jaq He Jaq, please answer this for me, in a situation where our 4hr chart is very far apart due to different broker's time, how do one know the best option of the broker time to use as a guide for the 4hr entries. thanks Check out my own 4hr chart and compare it to yours, it shows my waiting entry should be @ 147.50 can you see the problem? any idea on way out of these situation?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Ok ejikz. You are in profit now. DD is finished?..... May be.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Close position 1 at -15 pips. Leave 2nd free.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Good quest. RBH/L really are not exact entry points. RBH/L are entry zones/areas. Your chart and mine sure are not the same. But im sure that retracement zones are the same cause price is the same. In your chart 4h bar is formed in other time frame and it do that you miss somes entries... But im sure too that i miss some entries in my 4h chart if i compare with your. What do you do?. Possibly only thing you can do. To probe at 1h TF and risk. There is no reward without risk. Regards

--- 帖子 #471 ---
hallo everyone, 146.33(4h21MA, 4H RB low) - 148 (1H RB low,1H 50MA,1H RSI50) might be a A+ setup for buy. would be A+++ if it was not friday.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
In this trade i have a teorical (only teorical) advantage. My 4h chart say that 4h RBL is a support cause price touch this level. But i can loss. Sure. Accurate is not 100%. In your chart price dont touch your 4h RBL but could be touch more late and then my entry finally at loss. Im sure that in another trade you have a teorical advantage if you can see 4h RB how support/resistance. The most important thing is that you can loss a single trade or an entry but possibly in the long term results are the same. 4h bar is a reference. But 1h chart is the same for all brokers. Here there is no conflict. Its only a coment. Regards.

I took another entry @ 148 targeting 500 pips and the other entry which i took earlier @ 151.50 is still open which i' will close it at little profit when it get there.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi ejikz: Look my chart. At 148 is good entry. My 4hHa closed down. I increase position size 50%. Enter only 1 position here. In this trade my target1 is not RBH. Today is friday. When price reached RBH at +550 I move SL to BE and still open to next monday. Regards.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I am little bit confused though i m trading basket, whose pricee is 148? is it average price of 14 pair or price of a single pair. Please clarify me.

GM All: Today im looking for shorts. Enter Sell sa1-2 @150.000 Closed sa1 @ 145.000: +500 pips. Still open sa2: +600 pips. Waiting for price touch current RBH for stacking another sell position. as002: If you buy last fridays at 4HRBL there is no problem. Surely price go UP again. But if current 4h bar close below Clouds you are out and trend could be Down at least for moment. I prefer trade 1h bar. 4h price is so slowly. Regards.

Hi: Several post ago Atharmian ask me about the similitudes between my method and DIBS of Peter Crown. Other mate ask me too for the similitudes with flying buddha method of Pip Easy. I think that is better all people read some guidelines writed for this excepcional trader and find byself for this similitudes. I think that i dont violate any FF rule doing it. If a doing it please say me and im sorry for it. Regards. “The secret to success as a trader, in my humble opinion; is find a very low risk method to enter the markets..., and learn to wait” . “I personally would never use it for less than 1 hour bars”. “Most traders complicate things incredibly. Because their minds probably can't handle the truth yet that the markets basically feed where the orders are.” “Simple works in the markets, because they are very simple.” "These are very big markets and anything I might reveal is unlikely to matter much since very few will believe that profitable trading can be simple. Most are looking for some special complex answer. It isn't there!". “By trading less for bigger profits per trade”. “Only be willing to buy a market if it is up on the day.”.. “Only be willing to sell a market if it is down on the day.”. “For the record, I personally took every one ofthe indicated breakout trades-- sells and the buy today, obtaining at the bareminimum a 1:1 reward/risk ratio per trade, and on most of them, a 2:1 or 3:1 reward to risk ratio-- because of the speed and distance the market moved after the breakouts.” “What I like about these simple trades is the tendency to be able to cover your risk quickly by exiting half of your position at 1:1, allowing you to hold the remaining position with the initial stop (the other side of the inside bar) as a virtual "free trade". “In a larger term time frame you can stack on quite a position over a period of a few weeks with these "free trades". If the market quickly goes against you, you have the stops already in place. Then it is back to work building these structures up again until a huge move which is your payoff move of thousands of pips on large size.”.

I also like the 1H TF, but on friday the 4HRB low and 1H RB low was very close and although the bias was down a bounch was very probable. What time zone are you trading from? Did you enter on friday or last night? Last night's set up was AAA (MA, Ichi, RB confluence) but when I opened the PC the spread was 100+, and I did not wait for the spreads to lower at the Tokyo open.

This was not a good entry. I dont waited EMA........... Now im paying for it. Draw Down.......... and wait to BE.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Do you taked any entry ejick?. Yesterday finally?.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Jaquemate, 1. Thank you for mentioning Peter Crowns DIBS comments. I would appreciate if sometime you could also list the differences between your method and DIBS, as I asked in my original question 2. Also, I am curious. Is there away to use your Range Bar method on a single pair as opposed to a Basket? More and more I am convinced that such range bar methodology is much superior to indicator- based currency strengths or pivot/ SR crossings etc, given the statistical edge and profit:loss ratio management. Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Ok atharmian: Im glad that post was useful to you. I prefered to post Peter Crowns comments instead to write myself cause i dont want my limited english did not induce any words misinterpretation and all people understand it easily. I will answer you to the other question at another post. Regards.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
@ Jaq - Do you taked any entry ejick?. Yesterday finally?. Yes I did enter my trade today @ the 4Hr RB H which was @ 139.50 with 550 pips target over 8hrs ago, i already had a draw down of over 270 pips which i feel it is over now. thanks for the asking my friend Jaq

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Ok. After this bad entry and suffer a MAE of -450 pips finally i closed this trade at BE. Definitely a no good entry. Regards.

[quote=ianp;6388861] Hi Ianp. I said at another post that 21 EMA is a S/R. When price is so far EMA usually come back to touch it. In this trade price was so far EMA. I dont see it and i must wait to that a higher RB was formed near EMA. This is the reason i said this was a bad trade. Regards

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hi all. Today i wiil go to discuss yesterdays trades and how to manage it. Its better to look at chart and you understand what im talking about. #1 Enter 2 sell positions. #2 4hHA close bullish. #3 Close 1 position at open bar. You are anticipating a potencial trend change and increasing exposure 50%. Loss only the spread. #4 Price dont break down and i dont like leave the open position overnight. Move to BE or close with a minimal profit. #5 If you did not do #4 then close open position to BE. #6 Open 2 buy positions. #7 Close 1 position at target1. I hope explanations help you. Regards.

Hi Jaq, Nice pips with your great thread.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Jaquemate, This basket trading seems to be going well since you first started this thread back in Nov 2012. My question: can your Range Bar breakout principles also be applied to single currency pairs? If yes, are there any changes in methodology? Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi Atharmian: Range bars are more usually at basket charts. More pairs = more Range Bar. Why?. In few words. When some pairs are trending hoewer some pairs are ranging. This create a range of prices thats forms these Range bars. Price fluctuate inside this range up &amp; down untill breaks one of this range limits normally following the initial trend. 14 pairs basket chart and JPY pairs are very similars but JPY pairs ussually are trending pairs and Range Bars happens too but less often. You can compare both charts. Sometimes a Range Bars happens in both charts and price touch RBH or RBL in both RB doing the same. But another times dont. How do you can trade a single pair with RB rules?. The problem is that you have less oportunities and when trend is strong in a single pair price usually dont retrace more that 50% of a Range Bar and you can lost a golden oportunity. Sincerely. When a trade EURJPY i trade any potential entry following price action. Inside Bars, Range Bars, Volatily Breakouts. Most trades focus their efforts on finding an entry system looking for a perfect indicators combo..... and for me its a big mistake. Markets give you the entries without use of any indicator. One of most important things is not know when to enter. Its know when to exit and why. There is no secret in this bussiness. The success formula is very simpleto understand but difficult to do. Only you must do is squezze a trend when it happens building a piramid of positions and cut loss quickly. The success formula is to look for an infinity yield for gains an a fixed amounts for loss creating a system/method that gives you a very low risk entries and leaving winning positions opening adding new positions untill higher time frame trend is exaust. Range Bars gives you a visual and easy way for enter market but itself dont give you the success. You can trade Range Bars in a single pair but is less usually. Look at a basket chart and EURJPY chart and mark some RB in both charts. Then see EURJPY behavior and comment. Regards.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
GM All my trade update, My yesterday pending buy limit order of 155.5 did not get filled. but my target other target of 600 pips was achieved. i will be looking to go long today @ 162.2 range, which is also coincident with the 4hr RB Low. knowing fully well that today is Non-farm payroll news coming up.

GM All: Here we go mate. Good luck. Regards.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Jaquemate, Thanks much... I will try and make those comparisons between Baskets and EJ etc. Your explanation removes many of my doubts as it is very well thought out and practical. One of the best strategies I have read regarding how to trade and what to look out for ! Clearly all those technical indicators are always lagging price action and really it is looking at statistically valid situations of win-loss. If you can control loss then you can focus on your wins, and that is what your and the DIBS method are about. Stacking on top of wins and cutting losses quickly with visual indications of ranges and their breakouts (trends) Much thanks again. Very convincing. Athar.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hello All, Just as planned my target of 600 pips was attained. Thanks Jaq for the wonderful system you have put together for us here. Peace, happy weekend all, and i will continue to study the system over the weekend to make it flawless for me. For your information i trade the system live

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Dear Jaquemate/futurespec, I tried the template below, and it did not draw any RB hi-low range lines, or give me any other RB formation indication. The jaquebt,tpl template as below only contains the 4 indys: CandleTime, Ichimoku, MA and DoublecciWoody. This tpl or the other versions, bt2 or bt3, do not contain the Mn Bag v1.3 indy, which I added manually with default values. 1. Still nothing... can you or other folks help? I did switch TFs, but I don't know if Charts&gt;Properties&gt;ScaleFix will help since the original jaquebt.tpl template already looks adjusted. EDIT: I think I know what the problem might be: Sync time for jaquemate template vs futurespec's Mn Bag v1.3. My FXCM broker time is 0 GMT which also seems to be jaquemate tpl's broker time. So I get the same price display on my chart as with jaquemate tpl's text display in the top right corner. However Mn Bag v1.3 gives a different reading (168 vs 145 for mine/jaquemate.tpl) which must be due to a different start of candle time. Thus there is text displayed from Mn Bag v1.3 indy on the top right corner, but no range lines display (I do get email alerts, though.) And this must be the same issue for many other folks too... So, any solutions for sync here, or perhaps another way to draw RB H/L lines ? Also I read futurespec's initial instructions with the Mn Bag test indy. 2. What is an appropriate value for mHistRb so that the hi-low range lines do not go beyond the (next) breakout RB as in the figure? 3. What is mDist? 4. I understand mMinDiff refers to how much a new candle has to be away from the current RB to qualify as the next RB. Jaquemate mentions that a good value for minDist is 14x1= 14 pips, and for a RB large enough, the min size ought to be 14x10=140 pips. So how can we specify these two minimum parameters with Mn Bag v1.3? Best Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Here are 2 screenshots from jaquebt.tpl chart to which I added Mn Bag v1.3 indy as my previous email said. The bottom one shows the display with default settings (no ScaleFix.) From Mn Bag v1.3 only the display for RbH/L and Now value appears. Notice that this Now value is different than the current price reading on the chart on the right scale. The top screenshot shows only Mn Bag v1.3 indy display with Chart&gt;Properties&gt;ScaleFix set to 170/159 as Max/Min. The original jaquemate tpl disappears. Also it makes no difference if I switch the chart properties from the default online to the offline chart mode (except that with offline mode, the TF menu is greyed out.) So perhaps this has to do with the price readings discrepancy too... restarting MT4 several times did nothing. Also, I had earlier successfully created 14 pair offline charts for both M15 and H1 TFs using Basketv6 as instructed (which seems to have no bearing on the above.) Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
GM All: Today is a good example of a situation i talked several post ago. When we have a enormeous RB (about 1000 pips). RBL is below Ichimoku and RBH is above Ichimoku. How do you manage this bar?. I talked about this. Its possible that price never touch RBL and if you dont have inside market you can lost a trade oportunity. You must look inside this RB for another RB and enter with the same rule. You must to look what are price doing. Is price fluctuating inside another range of prices?. Yes. Forget high/low current RB limits and look for a Bar that delimits current price range. Look at the chart please. The marked bar is a RB inside current RB. This bar closed inside enormeous RB but above RB close. Price go up/down inside its range. Price is near EMA and Ichimoku. Its a good setup entry. Regards.

Hi all: Anybody taked this buy trade?.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hello All I had stayed out of the market since morning, and i planned to take my trade going short @ 166.5 targeting 1st TP of 500 pips with a 350 pips stop loss. I wish myself the very best. See the attached image

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Jaquemate, Thanks for the illustration...I can see that price doesn't touch the yellow marked RBL, and in any case EURJPY is pretty volatile ! 1. I wish I could start trading your method now that I am convinced it is much superior to the other methods I have seen, but I have the set-up problem with your template as I outlined in my Posts #539 and #540. Hope someone can help me ... 2. Also I am looking at your example of either DIBS or your RB method from today, but the diagram is not clear to me . Maybe there is some mix-up with colors highlighting low-high. DIBS, as I understand, requires a breakout from the IB (inside bar), out beyond the big outside bar? Or is it simply a breakout of any IB from its preceding larger IB? What is your opinion? I am attaching a diagram from the DIBS pdf. Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Jaquemate, I missed the trade owing to my set-up issues, but it looks a very staple, solid trade today. Questions for clarification: 1. I see that the small bar open is touching the RBL. But does your RBH/L touch rule apply for the small bar high-low touching the RBH/L, or is it necessary that the small bar body (open/close) touch the RBL/H too? My impression so far has been that the small bar hi-low penetration of the RBL/H is enough. 2. Also there is a big red (down) bar whose body (open) touched the RBL. So does this mean we could have taken a buy trade from here? Of course then, that trade would have been successful as price went up forming the small green (up) bar last. Then we could have opened another buy trade as in (1) when its body touched RBL too. Regards, Athar.

Hello Jaqumate, The market has been stalled for such a long time today, and i am still having my Long entry of yesterday and another one for today open. Please what is your stake if you finds yourself in such a situation? do you think the market is planning to reverse or what? Find attached the 2 present position of 1hr and 4hr chart @ my end. I am waiting for your RB market analysis with this type of situation. As for me, i still believe the market still have a higher percentage to go up for another 500 pips from the RB L of the 4 hour chart. take care

--- 帖子 #553 ---
GM All: Continuing with aplication of RB system in a pair chart i attached two EURJPY daily charts. You can see a 21EMA and 50EMA used for determine trend. Its very simple (KISS). Look for buys above 50EMA and look for sells below 50EMA. Process is similar to Ichimoku. In both charts you can see some RB´s. I drawed horizontal lines. These lines are RBH or RBL. Hoewer here i dont consider RB using the same rule. If you study the charts you can see is better consider RB agree with trend direction. In an UP trend a Daily RB always must be an UP Daily Bar. In a DOWN trend a Daily RB always must be a DOWN Daily Bar. You must look for entries around this zones but always confirming price action at lower time frame. i.e 1h. I explain later. Regards. P.D.: RB happens in all time frames and all currencies but i said many times that RB are more ussually in Basket trading.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi ejizk: For me daily trend will continue UP. May be 4h charts is forming a lower RB. If current 1h bar close below Ichimoku you can do 2 things. #1 close open buy position and look for shorts after this. #2 still open buy position moving sl at BE and wait for retrace at RBH and enter sell position diversificating. Regards.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
With the present outcome of the market RB chart, i plan to enter for a sell trade @ 168.5, and at the same time find a safe position to close all my buy trades @ around the same point. Thanks Jaq

--- 帖子 #556 ---
What price you buyed 168?.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Yes i bought the 2nd trade @ 168 this morning

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hi futurespec, Thanks for taking time out to reply me. I am posting here because I cannot attach charts in a PM. Please see the charts attached. On both the jaquemate tpl with your indy, and on your indy alone, the price quotes are different. The offline chart price says, 163.900 (same as for jaquemate/other posts on the thread.) Your indy price quote shows 164.78. Because of this difference, your RB lines might be out of sync on the jaquemate tpl. So, how do you calculate the 14 pair current price? Do you take it directly from the offline chart? Perhaps there is a calculation error, if not a candle start time difference. Regards, Athar.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Jaquemate, Very good illustration below. 1. Can you kindly attach your chart template/indys once again? I am having problems with RB lines drawn out of sync on charts as my post above shows. 2. On your single pair, EMA21/50 method, this certainly is one more trading avenue ! Do you draw the RB lines manually by observation, or is there a template available here too ? Thanks much, Athar.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Atharmian, The 14 pair (or other basket) price is calculated the same way as the other basket trade indi. It works from the current price of the relevant pairs. Because all pairs are not updating tics at exactly the same time then there can be some delay but the prices should always be the same (within a few tics). I am sorry if this is an issue for you but I cannot see any way to change it. When I was monitoring it previously I believe that the RbH/L pretty well matched those of Jaque .. indeed there is little reason why they would be any different. If you have it on an hour chart then broker start times should make no difference. I suppose if you use 4hr charts then it may make a difference. Sorry cannot be any more help than that. M.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
futurespec, OK, thanks. I am using H1 charts, and my broker is FXCM , with whom I haven't had any data issues. Plus looks like your indy and offline chart values are converging Two days ago the difference was 170.x vs 168.x ! Athar.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
futurespec/jaquemate, I finally solved my RB lines out-of-sync problem ! Had to go through the first few Kosmolate pages where he mentions that the original single pair chart (e.g., GBPJPY) on which one loads the Basket6 indys to generate offline charts must remain open. Lack of documentation... redid the Basket6 loading on a new chart, fixed my problem. Now there is very little discrepancy between offline chart and Mn Bagv1.3 readings, and both charts look good. Cheers, Athar.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
lucklogic, Here again Now that I have fixed my basic problem with the jaque tpl and Mn Bagv1.3, may I now ask for the template/indys for squalou's Ichi you mentioned below? What variations do you have in mind? Jaquemate has kindly posted some fab charts for single pair trades, and his variation on his RB basket method for them. Thanks, Athar.

Hi Deotoknow. I have the same problem with the HedgeBuy/Sell script. It used to work okay but then just stopped. I have deleted it and reloaded it a couple of times now but still no luck. If you tick "Ask manual confirmation" all the pairs will appear and you can enter your buys or sells manually. Bob

GM all, as we can see, my yesterday buy trade @ 167.2 got triggered and went into a big -ve pips, i am still trying to find a way around it to get it closed when it retrace and look to go on another sell trade @ 165.5 Thanks

Hi Jaquemate in my post you buy here and get out here and then do we wait for the next range bar Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi deotoknow: Your trade is correct. Entry an exit levels are correct. Now you must wait to RBL to enter buy position. If you dont close buy position when your new down RB is formed and enter another buy position at this RBL you are add aditional risk to your open position. I prefer close buy position at BE assuming that you can lost an entry oportunity. Look my chart please. 4HA indicator is down. In this case you could increase position size enter 50% of habitual lot/mini/micro. PD: My chart and your dont looks equal. why?. I changed from 14 to 10 pips setup for consider a new RB but in esential idea is the same. Regards.

--- 帖子 #575 ---

hI Jaquemate on this trade i go out (bed time )how do you look after this trade because if it goes up you are not there to take it out at BE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello everyone I have a few questions .... How can it be closed only one position (consisting of 14 pairs) when I opened up a few positions (3 X 0.1 X 14 pairs lot) ... I have tried with a script for closeall, I choose magic number for comment or text but did not work .... The only thing I can do is to close all positions ..... Do you have any scripts that close only orders given by the magic number? Another question ... Is it possible to the basket (# kos h1) chart open pending orders? Otherwise, the system works, I tested it and it gives good results. Just to follow rules and discipline well.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi imbonitore. Wellcome to thread. I attached a scritp for close all open positions opened with the same magic number. Please probe it. For me works. I think its possible open pending orders in a basket chart. At Kosmolate thread there is some EA but this EA open and close orders following Kosmolate rules and dont following RB rules. If anyone could programate it i think its possible too with this system. I hope help you. Regards. PD: Could yo coment more about your testing?. What are your conclusions?.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi deotoknow. For the moment the only way i knows for move to BE all positions when you are not infrom pc is doing it manually. For the moment..... If price dont break down is very risky leave open orders without monitoring. In a basket chart 1h bar against you can be 500 or more drawdown pips. If you dont move to BE before go to bed or close position you can blow an important percentage or your account. The first rule of all trading system must be to preserve your capital. Regards.

hallo out there, I like more the T101 Basket Trader. You can place pending orders, SL, TP and many other goodies. It has plenty of options. Just open two 1H offline bars, named differently, and throw in the Basket Trader (named accordingly). take a look below. #kos1# offline chart traded with T101 Basket Trader v2.2 #kos1# and #kos# offline chart traded with T101 Basket Trader v2.2 #kos# One basket for each offline chart, traded independently. http://i.imgur.com/1pn57DE.png the other way is the expert posted by futurespec, which needs only one chart open, and handles everything.

You are missing the Expert Advisors Button in your tool bar. Normally shows to the right of the New Trade Button. In the top menu line do this: View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize and add the Expert Advisors button. Sorry cant paste a screen showing the button that needs dragging across to the righthand part of the selection screen. Its all pretty standard from there. cheers scalpz

Hi Max: Thanks again for scripts but i dont know why but these scripts dont open orders with Exness. Today i attempt and it do anything. I lost a winner +150 net pips trade.... But NP sure. Next week price retrace and we come back to take. Could be a broker problem?. Cause i open basket chart and it dont run. I can open basket chart but price dont move and mnbag indicator programate by lucklogic dont shows RB. Im doing this: For monitoring basket i have open other mt4 with my Alpari account and i look charts. Then i attempt put orders with Exness.... but nothing. Bad luck for the moment but NP. Regards.
