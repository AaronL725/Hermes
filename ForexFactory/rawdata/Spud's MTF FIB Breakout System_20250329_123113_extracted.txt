Spud's MTF FIB Breakout System -------------------------------- Ever since I learned about Fibonacci numbers they have interested my pure mathematical statistical side into a compulsiveness. Having said that, it seems for such a simple sequence of numbers they can lead to very complicated methods of trading. Here's a simple day trade system with stochastics and Fibonacci numbers that may give you a winning edge in your trades. Indicators: Stochastics 5,3,3 and 14,3,3 (high/low, simple) ....use only %K line and overlay in one indicator window. Fibonacci set levels to: 0 label as 100 .764 label as 23.6 .681 label as 38.2 .500 label as 50.0 .382 label as 61,8 .236 label as 76.4 1 label as 0 Always draw the Fib line from the previous days low to high. Set-up At the close of the trading day (call this the previous day since this day is now over) draw you Fib line from the previous day's low to the high and draw it so the level lines extend into today (i.e. set your chart up with a shift) Entry Look for the price to break the 100 or 0 level of the Fib. You can do this by watching or setting a long order a little above the 100 level or a short order a little below the 0 level. You want the price to pass the 100/0 level not just touch it. Meanwhile.....take a look at the stochastics....when/prior to/or just after the price breaks the 100 Fib line you can almost be certain the stoch is breaking the 80 line or higher....well we want it to be or we will wait for it to do it and then we enter the trade. Similarily if the price breaks the 0 line we want the stochastic in the 20 or below area. You can take a few more risks. In a long; if the stochastics are climbing together after a down move and a turn up; or if the stochastics have crossed 20 and are moving up. Exit When the price breaks 100 (long as an example), move your FIB line up so that the 0 line is where the 100 line was. Exit when you hit 23.6 (123.6), 38.2 (138.2) and/or so on. Let the stochastics be your guide....if they both or one stays above 80 keep riding the trade. The 14,3,3 stochastic has more bearing on the trade than the 5,3,3, however both together is perfect harmony. What's MTF and Where is It? MTF = multiple time frame and it is in the 5,3,3 and 14,3,3 stochastic. Time Frame I use the 1H chart for daily. You can use the 4H chart but then you are trading weekly then. I would not use a smaller time frame than 1H as you start to lose the reliability of the Fib. Currencies This is universal, but I love the GBPJPY. You want pairs that have some good daily range as you want wide Fib numbers so you can make some pips! If you are trading the smaller day range pairs, use the 4H/weekly fib. Umm..Isn't This Just A Breakout Above Yesterday's Hi/Lo? Well it is if you just trade the breakout and use the stochs....but ohhhh laddie there is sooo much more to this simple system...... The Fib levels give you exit targets, use the Fib/stochs and get used to it....you won't be sorry and you'll understand what comes next (in a little while) a whole lot better. Here's a picture...hopefully it speaks a 1,000 words:

hi spud, thanks for your latest method. one question here, why must we draw fib from low to high? your chart example showing the gj is moving up. so we draw the fib from low to high. when it's moving down so we draw the fib from high to low? am i right abt this spud? im sorry if this is a silly question. im still learning. especially the fib thingy.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I only draw from low to high to make the level labels make sense...i.e. they will always be 0 at bottom and 100 at top. Not too important now, but there is reason to my madness.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
okay spud. thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Here's another long example...notice the stochastic exit indication. Also I've added a few Fib levels to make life easier. The Fib levels are now: -1 label as 200 -.764 label as 176.4 -.681 label as 168.1 -.500 label as 150.0 -.382 label as 138.2 -.236 label as 123.6 0 label as 100 .236 label as 76.4 .382 label as 61.8 .5 label as 50.0 .681 label as 38.2 .764 label as 76.4 1 label as 0 1.236 label as -23.6 1.382 label as -38.2 1.500 label as -50.0 1.618 label as -61.8 1.764 label as -76.4 2 label as -100

The following 3 charts on next 3 posts are for 3 consecutive days...show how you can follow a continuous down trend...like could this be any easier! Notice on this chart there is a fake break above 100...see the stochastic...stochastics never lie (well most of the time).

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Day 2

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Day 3

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Again the stochastics don't lie. We get a good entry but the market goes against us in this chart. We get plenty of warning from the stochastics and depending on how long you waited your losses would be fairly small if any...you may have even gained a few pips.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Here's today so far.... We had a good long entry signal but that signal is fading as the stochastic begins to droop below 80. I grabbed 5 pips and decided to get out and wait to see what develops.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Spud, Good stuff from your brain as always. Just curious if this method you delineate here is intended to supercede the earlier MTF Stoch or is this another way to look at Stochs? Thanks, KudzuFX

--- 帖子 #12 ---
This is yet another way to make simple winning trades in Forex.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks Spud. This looks like another successful method of yours - and your chart is so, so easy to look at, as well as to read. I wonder if you realize just what an encouraging and positive effect your knowledge and generosity are having on so many people. It makes new traders, such as myself, much more confident - especially when seeing profitable trades. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Anyway you upload your template? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
hey spud good stuff, couple questions, 1. You said 1hr is like daily timframe, I thought the 1hr with 14,3,3 is like a 4hr chart, I'm just confused by this. 2. How many pips do you consider enough for the break of the hi or low. Thanks

--- 帖子 #16 ---
The 1Hr is for "day trading" and you are using the "previous day" hi/lo for the Fib. The 4Hr uses the previous week hi/lo for the fib and you'd be trading on the week. The 14,3,3 is "like a" longer" time frame compared to the 5,3,3 stochastic. On the 1H it is like a 1H 5,3,3 and 3H 5,3,3...."like" is a big word here because it is not exactly like using a 3H chart and a 1H chart with 5,3,3 stochastics. How many pips for a break? Well I just eyeball it and look at he space between 100 and 123.6 and look for price to go past about 5-10% of that distance. Obviously you don't want to wait too long in case we need to bail out or take profit at 123.6. Getting in too early isn't really an issue, as long as you wait for at least a 1 pip past the 100 level entry. Too early may mean riding it a bit longer. Let the stochastics be your guide too.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
this is a slight derivation on the way I trade. I will try to post some charts as we go along and add some additional notes on fib targets. Also right click the fib line and chose Fibo Properties, then chose the Fib Levels tab then add @%$ to the description line in MT4 (example 61.8@%$. This will place the price next to the fib level.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I bet between the 2 of you we can make this the best system out there. I look forward to following this thread and seeing more charts...Joe

--- 帖子 #19 ---
This is sooo simple, even a dork like me can trade it! Thank you Thank you Thank you. I can see so many possible variations for stop losses, money managment ect. I'll be eagerly watching this thread

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanks for the @%$ tip. I'd be interested in knowing more about your sytem.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I love it spud I am trying to get simpler (the two step) &amp; man you are just a goin' you are going for the tango &amp; the ramba at the same time &amp; you are still in those high heels!! HeeHee TEB

--- 帖子 #22 ---
This indicator will do that job for you:

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Here are a collection of charts for every day traded in February 2007. I've added a few comments on each to help guide anyone interested. February gained 800 pips...net. There were 17 trades, 8 resulted in pip gains, 6 were mainly spread losses or break even, and 2 actually lost a few pips. That's a 47% win percentage for 800 pips taken home. The big reason this wins pips so much is that it is extremely hard to lose pips. Actual losses from spread and lost trades was well under 100 pips....that's an 8:1 reward to risk ratio.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thanks for the pics spud. This is the best webinar I've attended so far, and it's FREE? I can actually see myself trading live again soon (and mak'in pips 'ta boot')

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Quick question, in my MT4 version I have Low/High and Close/Close as options in my parameters settings. I noticed in your first post that you stated you use High/Low, is this correct and if so do I need to acquire another SO to use?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I just modified the Stochastic indicator to display the K% line only. It also has an alert. You can turn the alert on or off. It'll alert only once per bar and not per second. I don't know how to combine 2 stochs into one indicator. Maybe in the next version. Perhaps I can add in some arrows on the indicator window or on the chart in the next version. Feel free to edit the indicator to combine 2 stochs or add in an auto Fibo drawing. The Alert messages are: GBPJPY (H1): Stoch(5,3,3) FibBreakout? Buy Alert GBPJPY (H1): Stoch(5,3,3) FibBreakout? Sell Alert GBPJPY (H1): Stoch(14,3,3) FibBreakout? Buy Alert GBPJPY (H1): Stoch(14,3,3) FibBreakout? Sell Alert Edit: See post #31 for new version: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...1&amp;postcount=31

Thanks Spud for a nice simple system to add to the armoury.Looking forward to your future enhancements. Cheers mate

OK - here goes I mostly trade g-yen and I utilize a MTF stochastic nearly identical to your methodology. As you stated in one of your forums the key is to be able to know the stochastic well. Regarding fibs I have utlized them for many years and have come to realize some neat points that can make a lot of pips. My largest gain to date was 738 pips on 2 pairs in one day. This is unusual but the fibs were pointing the targets all the way. I also lock in smaller pip profits (24 TP) when I do not have a clear fib analysis leading the way. The 24 pip TP came from much back testing the g-yen to optimize win/loss ratio and TP together. I prefer long g-yen due to carry and will only take short g-yen if I am away from the dealer rollover sufficiently to profit from the short before I am forced to close out due to the negative interest on shorts. I use the mt4 fib retracement tool and set the following levels: LEVEL......Description 1.764.......176.4 1.618.......161.8 1.382.......138.2 1.236.......123.6 1..............100.0 0.764.........76.4 0.618.........61.8 0.5.............50.0 0.382.........38.2 0.236.........23.6 0..................0.0 -0.236......R23.6 -0.382......R38.2 -0.5..........R50.0 -0.618......R61.8 -0.764......R76.4 -1...........R100.0 -1.236.....R123.6 -1.382.....R138.2 -1.618.....R161.8 -1.764.....R176.4 R is used for retracement in the opposite direction of yesterdays high to low (or low to high) move. Note the invert of one another: 100-23.6 = 76.4 100-38.2 = 61.8 Some of the fib pointers I have learned are: I always point and click the fib retracement tool at the high or low price from yesterday first then drag the tool backwards in time to your other swing high or swing low. Bear in mind this is backwards for those that have had formal fib training. But in the heat of battle I have found this to be the best way for me to profit over the years. Quick and easy fib drawing. The original purpose of the tool I use in mt4 for fibs is to measure retracements only, but properly applied you can use it for projections too. Now for the cool tips (pictures to follow): If price goes from 1 to 100 and then drops back to 76.4 – what fib would that be? Answer = 76.4 Ok if price goes from 100 to 1 and then pulls back to 23.6 - what fib would that be? Answer = 23.6 EASY – I think you need to arrive at that answer by going through a lot of individual days and drawing the fibs to see the retrace and the extension - that is what has given me "nerves of steel" when it is trading time and the fib retraces and then shoots right to where I had the target. So how do I see the targets!! The good news: the targets are based on the retracements we have already hit or are hitting today from yesterdays major move. If price retraces to 23.6 then see how often price hits the 123.6 aggressive target or the next lower conservative target 100.0. If price retraces to 61.8 then the aggressive extension would be 161.8 and the next lower conservative extension would be 138.2. I look for price action (PA) to consolidate around the retracement points. When price goes to a retracement point and hangs out there I am simply waiting for the stochastic to give me the go signal. Quite often I am armed with the conservative and aggressive target well before the market finishes its course. And the wonderful part is the stochastic will start indicating the move is nearly over often where one of the 2 targets were located. Learning which target to take happens with practice. When price reaches the conservative target you must be comfortable with price action to know whether to close out or wait for the more aggressive target. A ll you have to do is keep the MM very, very, very low until you figure out how to make 25-50-100+ pips per day and you will be a pip making machine. Practice – Practice! I draw fibs starting with monthly all the way down to M30 - obviously I only have to draw the larger time frames after multi day massive trend moves. I leave the big time frame fib on the H4 chart. In other words I draw the significant price swing fib on the monthly or weekly chart and then change the chart to H4 for the stochastic. Don’t forget to check “Ray” on the Fibo Properties Tab. One last word: I am a student of statistics and have produced EA’s for no other purpose than to receive lots of backtest data. I can tell you the optimized pips for highest profit, lowest % drawdown, stop loss &amp; trailing stop, etc. I know statistically when I can raise my leverage because I have reached my NORMAL consecutive losses. With MTF stochastic that is usually only 1 consecutive loss – rarely 2 in a row. But none of this would have been possible unless I began trading live early on with only pennies at stake. Even when I could bank roll larger amounts and greed kept telling me to go for it, I would go back to pennies. Eventually the results picked up and the stress was in check. OK – Finally – SHOW ME THE MONEY – I mean Charts. I will be posting 3 charts – none of which were perfect fib days to point out how you should use the fib levels to protect your profit and keep moving that stop to a better price as each fib target is passed. Then on occasion you will remove the stop altogether because price is speeding up in the direction of your higher fib extensions. Literally at this point you should be sitting on the single click order close out and watching for the fast retrace at one of the fib extension levels like 161.8 or 176.4. That’s the fun part. On rare occasion I close out on a 161.8 or 176.4 only to watch the price keep going to the 261.8 extension. Amazing! Best Regards ……………PiPr Pro

See post #26: In version v. 1.1, I was able to combine the 2 stochs into 1 indicator. So for the new alerts, if both stochs cross over level 80, then we'll have a Buy alert. And vice versa for level 20. Download v. 1.1 below:

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Now you really have my juices flowing, thank you for your contribution. Thanks mate

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Spud, I like the twist on this strategy of combining a breakout with the stochs. How do you deal with the timing issue regarding the b/o level and the stoch value? Would you take the break of a low if the current stoch was below 20 but the previous close was above? Be interested to see how this works out. Thanks for your efforts in your postings. G-Man

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I mentioned that there is a reason for the Fibonacci numbers. If you look at all the charts I posted you can see dozens of missed trade opportunities. There are ways to capture these opportunities, but the more we chase the more complicated this system will get. So, I am breaking this down into small pieces.....hopefully so you understand how it all works together. The first piece of the puzzle was MTF stochastics, a powerful tool but with a huge limitation. The strongest reason to use Fib numbers is that like stochastics that run from 0-100, Fib provides us a scale for price from 0-100. The problem with stochastics is that they don't measure the scale of the price move. A stochastic that moves from 0-100 may only move the price 20 pips on a 1H scale one time and perhaps 100 pips the next. Where as the price moving from 0-100 on a Fib scale will tell you exactly how many pips there are to be had. This is where MTF Stochastics and Fibonacci combine. Stochastic and price move together and we know from MTF stochastics that with multiple time frame stochastics moving together price moves with them. The hi/lo of the previous day to create the Fib lines is arbitrary. There is no "special" reason to use this hi/lo other than it makes sense for our brains to work in specific time periods because our brains are programmed for this. You could argue that news is daily and thus catching the hi/lo of a day period reflects fundamentals in the day. However you want to slice your bread, I use the hi/lo of the previous day because it works....and that's the only reason that counts to me. We need to make some changes to our charts. The first is that we no longer use 80/20 on the stochastics as a level. They now become 76.4 and 23.6.....so our scale on stochastics now corresponds to our fib scale on price. We use the 5,3,3 and 14,3,3 stochastics from 1H and 30M. On your desktop you want to have price and stochastics for 1H above your stochastic only 30M chart so that the day period lines up. (You'll see that on my next chart). We are getting more complicated because we will now use both the 30M and 1H stochastics to identify more trade opportunities.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The chart below is from March 1st 2007. The first thing to notice is that at the break at the first break at 100 we did not jump in. Honestly, it wouldn't matter if we did as our losses would be insignificant because we'd bail out soon after once the 1H stochs dived below 76.3 However, the 30M stochs are saying this is a no good trade because they are both falling. More significant is a little later on where the "short entry" arrow is pointed. Notice price has crossed and closed below 100 on the Fib level after having been above it. The 1H stochastics are at 38.2 (5,3,3) and 76.4 (14,3,3)....nice how that works out. The 30M stochastics are at 38.2 (5,3,3) and 50 (14,3,3).....I'm not making this up! What is also really important is that both sets of stochastics are moving down. Now, just like our MTF stochastics where the stochastics love to move from 80 to 20 or 20 to 80.....so our price loves to move on the fib scale from 100 to 0 and 0 to 100. The 4 most common moves of price and fib are (in no particular order): 1. Break 100 2. Break 0 3. Move from 100 to 0 4. Move from 0 to 100 The MTF stochastics nicely present us with which move price will make. So as we move along the chart the stochs hit 23.6. In MTF stochastics this would be an exit (at 20).....but now that we have the Fib we now are going to stay in unless our 14,3,3 on the 1H rises above or hits 23.6. You can use the 30M 14,3,3 rising above or hitting 23.6 as an exit...but in the long run...14,3,3 is much better. Now..moving along..our price breaks 0 and our stochs are below 23.6...so now we either ride the break or enter a new trade for the break at 0. As said we exit when the 14,3,3 hits or rises above 23.6. We don't have to be ultra picky on this...you can anticipate...you can wait until you see a definite cross....or you can exit a little earlier. We can use our MTF stochastic knowledge to try and find this moment....but the moment is around the 14,3,3 crossing 23.6! 200 pips to play with here...so lots of room if you don't get the entries and exits bang on.

Ok, so we made 200 pips following some pretty simple rules. Even if we missed the first entry and just went at the break, we would have had 50 pips. So, let's move on to the next day. Well this is a no brainer for 450 pips. Heck just wait for these no brainers and we'd do well every month. Price breaks 0, stochastics below 23.6 and a clear exit when the 1H 14,3,3 crosses 23.6. I can't make this one any more complicated or clearer for entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Well a nice weekend with 650 pips to party with. It must be Monday so will things get ugly? Well if you had a bad hangover you might miss this early entry...it pretty much starts right at the open...we might get in on this a little late and reduce our pips a good deal...but if we stuck to the rules we'd be in right at the open. Price breaks 0, both stochastics below 23.6 and the exit is again plain as day when the 14,3,3 crosses above 23.6. Take 375 pips. So that was 3 days. With no tricks, no wishy washy entries and exits and 1025 pips to grab. If you went for 20 pips a day that would leave you a 1025:60 margin of error on your entries and exits....but we'd be pretty numb to miss 50% of these pips. My next group of entries will concentrate on failures...so you can see what happens when things do go wrong.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
First of all, thaks again Spudfyre for yet another great system. I have been following yours and TEB's thread on MTF trading, which now are the backbone of my trading. As far as this one goes, I only have one question: Do we enter as price breaks the barrier, or wait for the candle to close and enter at the open of the next?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
My mistake...Low/High is the proper term. Doesn't matter...it is just calculating of the highs and lows and not the closes.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks banzai! Now I am going to keep you real busy with indicators from all this data coming in

--- 帖子 #43 ---
For hard rules..best to trade after the close and on the open of the next candle...then you have no fudge factors in the stochastics or fib levels. There is such a large margin for error here on entry and exit that I would just stick to the hard rules and forget trying to grab an extra 20 pips by anticipation...but that's easier said than done for us trader types.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
That's what I thought. Will keep you posted on how it goes.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
March 15 2007, the chart below shows the "typical" failure...this by the way was the first failure in March 2007. The entry follows the simple rules of a Break at 0 and the stochs below 23.6. However, the 14,3,3 stochs on the hour rise above 23.6 and we drop about 50 pips. Right after that there is an entry for a 200 pip gain....so the failure is pretty short lived....about 3 hours of crying in all....then back to happy mode. These are what most failure will resemble....whipsaws. They happen and that's the nature of having hard rules. However these failures are not common and amount to small fractions of the gains. Your losses are only as far as the 14,3,3 1H stochastic takes you....let it be your guide to exiting trades good and bad.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Great information Pipr! We all have lots of studying to do now Thank you for your input and sharing your strategies.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Rosco, Nice car. Don't know if this might help. Here's a basic Stoch indie. If you want it in the same window as the other Stoch just drag it to the window and then adjust your settings. (if you knew already, pardon.) KudzuFX

From here on I'll be posting daily events forwards. There will be more things discussed as we go because I believe it is the only way to show what to look for as we advance. So here is today's chart. On the chat last night I entered GJ short at 239.54. I exited at 238.34 for a net of 112 pips after spread. I exited on the 14,3,3 stoch coming up past 23.6. On the earlier short trade, I entered because the price moved from 100 to 76.4 on the fib. When price moves 2 levels on the fib it is common for the price to continue in that direction (123.6 to 76.4)....I don't use this as a hard and fast rule but it is a check mark towards entry. The 1H stochs were together at 50 and moving down together after a peak. The fact that they are together is a check mark, the fact that they are at 50 or below is a check mark and the fact that there stochs are moving from a peak is a check mark. So now have 4 reason to enter. The 30M stochs are much easier as they crossed from 76.4 so taking a ride to 23.6 on those is a strong compulsion to enter the trade with the 1H stochs headed down. The break at 0 is a sigh of relieve and since stochs are breaking below 23.6 all that is left to do is wait for the 14,3,3 to rise above 23.6 and count the pips. Right now there is no trade...stochs are too low for any clear indication price will continue to rise. Being Friday and later in the morning, I won't enter any more trades as I don't like to get stuck on weekend carries. Arguably and I forgot to mention that you could trade the long from when both stochs crossed the 23.6....my decision in not doing so was simply because I was asleep

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks Spud for your continuing efforts, everyone for very actively contributing and Banzai for the very nice indicator! The elasticity concept ,that Mr. Spud mentions on post #6, is very interesting and obvious with this Stoch setup. Any thoughts on this as a filter or leading indication, anyone? I'm looking forward to working on this thread over the weekend! Thanks again, everyone. FXS

--- 帖子 #50 ---
SpudFyre, What was the system basis of the 239.54 short on 5/18/07? As I understand the system, I would have gone long on the break of the previous days high with confirming stochastics.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
A couple of questions for anyone who knows and is willing to explain: 1. How do you line up the time periods between the 1H and the 30M charts (one on top of the other with the day period indicators lining up)? My 30M day period is twice the width of the 1H day period because of the double number of candles. 2. How do you get rid of the default 80 and 20 lines on the stochs? Thank you, Fish

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Right click on chart-choose indicators from list-find stoc or fib break out then highlight-choose edit then levels tab and you can change 80-20 or add lines there...it appears not all questions will be answered...thats life

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Fish, You can get your time periods to line up several ways . . . use the +/- magnifying glass to zoom in or out, or you can just change the size of the 30M window.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Jake and Tony: Questions answered. Your suggestions worked. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Kudzu, Thanks, we like to car here in Kentucky and the girl is quite cute too!! Appreciate the indicator.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
What an interesting approach, Spud! Attached is an indicator to draw the fibs both above and below based on the previous day high/low. My broker shows the last 2 hours of Sunday so the indicator is coded to use Friday high/low if today is Monday. It may barf when Monday is a market holiday (as it was this year on Christmas and New Years) but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. If I get time, I'll add the actual prices to the levels and possibly combine Sunday data with Friday just in case a new high/low is created on Sunday. Feel free to modify/improve this - if you do so, please share... Lou G

I realized after posting that the Fibo indicator (post#56) would not function correctly on the M30 timeframe - it's fixed now (I think).

Spud, in a case such as that shown in this chart, is a re-entry called for? Thanks, Lou G

Need a few things: a 76.4 fib line you'll want to see that crossed The stochastic 80 level changed to 76.4 The stochastic 20 level changed to 23.6 30M stochastics If the price closes above the 76.4 fib line AND the 1H stochastics and the 30M stochastics (all) cross 23.6...then you have a long

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I'm sorry - I asked that question in a confusing way. The chart posted shows the fibs drawn below the previous day low. The initial entry is at 0600 hours when price falls below the previous low. After a few hours the stochs begin to rise through 23.6 ending the trade with a modest profit. Then the stochs fall again (at about 1300 hours) and my question is: would you re-enter short at this point? Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
The fibo indicator in post 56 was updated to show pip prices at the fibo levels.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thanks for all your efforts spud. Just 1 question. The first short trade on the chart shows price on Stock 1h and 30min above the 23.6 But you previously said stoch had to be breaking through the 20 level (now the 23.6). As long as stoch is trending down is this still a trade above 23.6? Thanks

--- 帖子 #63 ---
so acceptable to trade long from a lower level cross? thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
the chart shows you would have made a loss on the first short but gained on the second short.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
The chart below is an example of a typical retrace scenario where we enter a short trade, it exits early for a loss and then we enter long on the retracement and in this case make a much bigger gain than what we loss. The first cross is at 0 with the stochs crossing 23.6 down. The 30M stoch is just above 23.6 but the stochs are tight together and have a nice down move so this is an entry. We could simply wait for the next 30M candle to close to see if the stochs actually cross 23.6...but that is being ultra conservative here. This entry is short and the market moves against us and signals an exit with a loss of about 50 pips. At the same time the price has crossed and closed above 0 and the stochs have both crossed (1H/30M) above 23.6. So now we have a new long entry. This we ride until we get an exit signal...which comes with a 125 pip gain. So we net 75 pips for the day. This is a tricky trade since it is on the Thursday before Easter and to make this trade means riding the holiday weekend out. A 50 pip loss won't kill us over the month so whether we choose to enter a trade over the weekend is individuals choice. Anyways, weekend issue aside...this is pretty typical of a retrace entry...where you need the same rules to apply that the cross close and the stochs line up.

Hi Lou, I like how it uses two colors for upper and lower levels, but shouldn't we add the inner levels? And the High/Low calculation didn't work to well for me. I simplified it and tested it on Alpari and IBFX (for sunday candles). Let me know what you think. And of course a big Thank you to Spud, for sharing this with us!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I'm not sure if you have read my MTF Stochastics journal? That may help better explain these type of moves. A legitimate long signal can be a price cross 100 level (previous high) with stochastics crossing up from 23.6 as an example. There is a "normal" tendency for stochastics to cross "20" and rise to "80" or to cross "80" and fall to "20". This is better statistically when multiple time frames are synchronized in this movement. Generally 4H/30M or 1H/30M when moving in tandem will yield a very high tendency to make this move.

I received a PM asking a few interesting questions - so I thought I would post here and I have added a few comments appropriate for the forum. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- .................... Would you also be willing to share your experience and insights, as to: - what stop sizes do prodaytraders use? - what reward/risk, win/loss ratio is generally preferred. When scalping and/or intraday swinging? - is there still real value in pivot points, fibs or are they now just an arbitrary line in the sand? - how do you identify areas of resistance or support? Have a great coming week Regards Jon[/quote] ------------------------------------------------------------------------- My Response................ Hi Jon, your guess is as good as mine regarding the truthfulness of the post you sent me. There are as many versions of bank traders and hedge/currency funds as you can imagine. I do agree that the larger the equity obviously the smaller amount of pips necessary to achieve a needed cash return. You do the math. The folks good at doubling assets quickly do via different pools of money. The larger pool is lower risk 0.5% to 2%, smaller pools that have high risk 25:1 to 100+:1 leverage. But more importantly top traders have a close stop in mind where they will close the trade when high leveraged without blowing the whole pool. Stop sizes depend on several issues: currency pair, pip taraget (i.e. small pips - small stop; large pip target - large stop). My normal program I trade on g-yen is based on fibs &amp; MTF stochastic and usually my close out (notice I didn't say stop) is slightly greater than 1-2 fibs away, therefore I can raise leverage and know my losers will not blow the accounts. I do not calculate risk / reward % when trading. My win / loss is 83%. Pivots and fibs both work. Just watch any commodity trader in the pit and when you see them looking at the back of the order pad, those are usually price points or pivots. Regarding fib levels - that is one of 2 primary technical techniques I use. I wouldn't want to trade without them. My best day was 738 pips total on 2 pairs and the fibs led the way. But they don't always work. Pivots work - but I'm not an expert. I know traders who are. Regarding support and resistance (I use fibs) - so much has been written on the subject I certainly can't give it justice here. Remember this: most all of the methods on Forex Factory are great and then they go bad for a period and people go looking for another. The key is taking one of the fine methods here at FF and looking for the worst trade period and figure out how to minimize the draw down at that time. When Spud started threads that were similar to the way I have traded for some time I began watching and learning form someone else. He has already given me an idea I hadn't thought of before to trade my normal way but to add an extra entry that looks promising. Because I do this for a living, within 72 hours I had written an EA to help me find the averages, optimized the results , re-ran the backtests and then found all of the worst performing periods and have been in the process of going through those periods by hand advancing 1 bar at a time to see how I would trade the difficult periods with just this one slight modification. And yes I may only sleep 2-3 hours a night for weeks (polyphasic sleep). But I too have a dream: to continue doubling assets in ridiculously short periods of time and to become more efficient. ( I will not say how quickly because most would not believe me and some traders would think my time to double took too long). My dream is to help my church &amp; charities with millions, continue teaching my children the trade (pun intended) and be a great husband. Dream BIG dreams! Last, you must use live accounts to practice - demos are deceiving. But, lower the money management (MM) down to pennies at risk until you have a great system. MM and psychology are key issues. What if it took you 2 years to learn how to trade like a pro. I think it would be worth every minute. Best Regards, PiPr Pro

Great advice PiPr Pro! Finding good systems is the easy part. Molding them to your lifestyle while you learn is not so easy. Show me the micro pips baby!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Spud told us to add a separate M30 stochastic below our H1 price and stochastic chart. During live trading this is easy to let both charts move forward with auto scroll. But, when backtesting you must pull both charts forward or back separately to line up the time frames (or use F12, Shift F12). Does anyone know if it is possible to have a combined chart with both stochastics at the bottom. Or is there a better way in MT4 to accomplish moving both charts forward or back one bar at a time simultaneously ?

Offtopic, but the polyphasic sleep, Ive just googled and found a wiki entry, I shall read more. I had never heard of it. I knew that dolphins, ducks slept only with one side of their brain, while the other side was mentally active. I had wondered if humans too, had this ability, or could learn this ability(i suspect we can). So thanks for the heads up regarding polyphasic sleep. It's certainly needed to trade forex lol

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Not specifically. What I've done (and this is simplistic) is comment the value of the 30Min stoch in an EA. I always take the easy way first.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I don't know if I would recommend polyphasic sleep for long periods. Its tough to maintain a fitness level. I will say my alert level is instantaneous when I wake up from one of my (6) 30 minute naps. The experts say the brain goes into REM sleep quicker after you have taken the normal 2 weeks to adjust to the rigorous schedule. Also you have to have a job (or trade for a living) where those around know your schedule and understand or allow the naps that will come in the middle of the day. I have gone 6 months before on polyphasic and was amazed when I came off it and began sleeping 7 hours a night how exhausted I was. Then went back on polyphasic and 2 weeks later like clock-work the exhaustion went away. It is my understanding that polyphasic is used by elite military teams?? Who knows??

--- 帖子 #75 ---
sorry can u elaborate. do you mean on the H1 chart you have a comment value in say the upper left hand corner that simply states the M30 stochastic values for 5,3,3 and 14,3,3? If so, the only issue I see is not being able to see the graph in the process for M30.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Sounds like you've got it. I've also been modifying an indicator submitted by Skyline on another forum to show the stoch values in a larger font that changes color when stoch direction changes and when stoch reaches key levels. My time is so limited i guess i should just request someone else do it. Any takers?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Greetings. I have searched the thread, and don't think this question has been answered: Do you ignore stoch crosses, and use only closed bars for the Stoch signal? I noticed you said to use closes for fibo breaks a few times, but never saw anything for closes on Stochs. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I don't advocate stoch crosses as they are usually as good as they are bad. If using multi-time frames, there is no need to wait for the 1H to close if 3x15M stochs are giving a favourable impression and 30M as well...so 1x30M and 3x15M is providing a good insight into 3/4 of the 1H. However, the safest route is to trade on the close of the stoch and price, if one is not experienced with stochastics and mutli-time frames.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I am getting a lot of these in my PM box..this being the latest.... "....I can't base a good system on one month of 800+ pips. There seems to be some discretion in your trades too.... which bothers me a little." If anyone who reads this system hasn't done so...please read my journal about MTF Stochastics. You'll find I am a strong advocate against large pip taking. When I report 800+ pips it is because it is what was there to be taken....nothing more. My goal is 20 pips per day ....because I live on Forex.....if i can grab more and there is no reason not too...I will....but things have to be in my favour to even considerate it. I trade on making my pips worth more and taking less than trying to trade for small pip values trying to grab 100 pips a day. Sorry if i insult anyone...but to make a living at Forex is not going to be done chasing 100's of pips. Having said that....if I get 100 pips in a day, that';s like 5 days of trading for me. I advocate if there are 100 pips to be had in a day then I have a HUGE margin of error to be right in my trade...recover from a bad trade and not stress about it. I am extremely reluctant to report 800+ pips a month for the very reason that it sounds like being a snake oil salesman....Again....I don't advocate trading for all the pips...just where the pips are and what signalled them and what signals an exit. I realize there is a lot of discretion trading MTF stochastics that cannot be put in a document but comes from studying a learning stochastics for years and 1,000's of hours. With regards to discretion......let me remove the discretion and give hard rules. The only real brain intervention is knowing if the stochastic lines are close together and moving in the same direction over 2 time frames for some trades...for most that even won't matter.

I'm not sure I understand why the inner levels are necessary. I don't see that they are used anywhere in the method, unless I'm missing something.

Attached are charts from the first 10 trading days of April 2007. These trades are strictly by close of price candle. I've only included the 1st 10 days because it took a lot of time to edit the charts to be non-discretionary, so there are no discretionary trades. I have coded the files as such April 27 2007 50 x100x76x76 Date Pips Cross 100, 1H stoch cross 76.4, 30M Cross 76.4 Also there are "b0" = bounce off zero "x0" = cross 0 and "b100"=bounce off 100. Anything like April 27 2007 F40 means a failure and loss of 40 pips From April 2 to April 13 there were 8 trades over 10 trading days... 5 trades gained pips(325) 1 trade broke even(0) 2 trades loss pips(-85) This includes spread and rounding down to make the pips "even" numbers. 6 of the 8 trades were simple x0 or x 100 trades of which in all cases the stochastice were above 76.4 (long) or below 23.6 (short). There are some arguable gains: ...April 13...the 1st breakout came on Easter weekend...trading without discretion would mean entering the trade on the last day before the weekend and carrying it over the holiday weekend...if you are opposed to trading over weekends and not following the system...then you lost 125 pip gain for not following the system.... ....April 5....the breakeven trade was discretionary because there was no exit signal but a trader trading safely could have grabbed 20-40 pips and a trader watching the stochastics would have exited long before the breakeven and still gained pips.....at worst without discretion and waiting for complete reversal the loss would have been about 30 pips... ....April 10....this trade is based on MTF STochastic rules from my journal...it is not dicretionary if those rules are applied where there is an upward cross by both stochastics and well defined upward movement...so arguably these 55 pips are gained from early entry and only count as 20 pips when the price crossed 100 and the stochastics crossed 76.4 which is a non-discretionary entry... Otherwise, all other trades are all closed entries and clearly identifiable. A reminder, this is a breakout system. The first 10 trading days really haven't had any great breakouts...the highest being 125 pips and the next 80 pips. So, arguably this non-dicretionary method still shows we can trade for the breakout and not be suffering any losses while we wait...and we have gained a few pips along the way.

Hi Spud Thank you for sharing this system. It's look greate. I would like to know what SL you take when you enter a trade? How do you put the M30 stochatic with the 1H? Regards simon

The inner levels are a visual tool. Don't be too quick to ignore those inner levels and discard them. There is a huge amount of information there. Trade with them. There are lots more details to extract more pips from inner levels and to use inner levels for entry exit reasons, However, the biggest use of inner levels is they tell us what is going on and where things are. Unfortunately that use comes with experience in using them. For example....does price crossing 2 fib levels on close matter? (The answer is most likely it can signal direction)....but one must study those moves to use them. It becomes an added indication for decision making and can be discretionary in its use.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
"Withdrawal" from a trade is based on stochastic movements or xross/bounces that reverse our direction. "Stops" are used to protect our account so they are moving with market conditions. I use rather big stops because I don't want to lose and exit a trade simply from price movement during a candle's high/low. Whether one chooses to use a figure like 2% of the account, this is how stops should be used......given your account is large enough. Money management is a whole different subject and an arguable one. I don't use "stop loss" in trading because that is creating a point of acceptability to draw down rather than trading the market conditions. To trade with a "stop loss" is trading one system to enter based on market conditions and another system based on fear from draw downs that is subjective to our emotions rather than the market conditions. It is counter productive. However, trade with a stop to protect the overall account. In most of my trades that is 2% of the total account. It means I will have to suffer 50 straight horrific (extreme) losses to lose my account....simply impossible since my winning percentage is above 85% and such a strong move down by the markets will be seen long before my 2% is reached...unless it just drops straight down....the odds of that being almost nil. In the long run whatever market events triggered those horrific losses are rare....probably less than 1%. Market gains will always out perform any such horrific losses if I stick to trading my system and use market conditions to stay in or withdraw from a trade....I'll probably benefit from 50% of the horrific price moves in the long run. Stop losses (losses caused by hitting stops) increase with less margin...it is a simple formula. Trade with $500 in your account at $1 a pip and you must use at least 20-25% percent stops to protect the account...meaning 4 bad trades and you need another $500. Whereas a $10,000 account with 2% stops means 4 really bad trades lose $800 but you have 200 pip stops and lose only 8% of the account. With $500 accounts you will make more bad decisions protecting from draw downs because you simply are totally focused on protecting losses. Whereas with $10,000 the losses won't even make a dent....you won't like them....but you never even thought about them,the focus was the exit for pips and that leads to more wins. I strongly suggest at minimum $2000 with 5% stops...it's not great but far better than refilling your account 4 times with $500 trying to trade with 5% stops. The goal being to pump that account up as fast as you can and keep lowering the percentage rate for the stop until you get to 2%. I can bet every $500 trader has said this to themselves..."if I only rode out that trade a little longer I would have made 50 pips". It is soooo hard to trade Forex if your exits are controlled by fear of draw downs vs what your system is telling you. I trade with "dynamic" stops usually starting at 50 and adjusting with the market...but never to exceed my 2% of the account...well almost....there has to be an extremely good reason to stay in a trade when my 2% level is reached. I rarely stop out if ever. I always decide to get out based on market conditions. Sorry I rambled but I think it is a point lost on so many.

As I have posted in my journal, the journal will be used to chart the trades and the chat session on tradingrooms.com will be where the live trades will be conducted. The journal being the summary of each trade. Analysis of the trades will happen in this thread. This is where the trades will be dissected for failures and successes and what indications existed. Also this thread will be used to focus on indicator development or added rules and methodology. As much of MTF stochastics are a part of this system, it is highly recommended that anyone reading this thread also become a solid reader of my journal http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=22105

Here's the new version of my indicator. I have to change the Alerts according to the new rules. Here're some alert messages: GBPJPY (H1): Both Stochs cross up 76.4% USDJPY (H1): Only Stoch(5,3,3) crosses up 76.4% EURJPY (H1): Only Stoch(14,3,3) crosses up 76.4% EURUSD (H1): Both Stochs cross down 23.6% GBPUSD (H1): Only Stoch(5,3,3) crosses down 23.6% USDCAD (H1): Only Stoch(14,3,3) crosses down 23.6% and then you'll decide whether to buy or sell. It'll alert only once per bar and NOT per second. You can turn the alert on or off. http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/4...212007avl6.gif EDIT: I also modified the b-clock indicator so you can change to any color now.

The charts were M30 (you can count the bars between period separators). I utilize H1 &amp; M30. Regarding Fibs and PA, my other entries are more aggressive where I will take a bounce off a particular fib level. Those have a lesser win / loss ratio but nevertheless are part of my trading. My recommendation is to study hundreds of trade set ups the way SPUD has given them to you. He has posted a great system.

Hi guys, I am a little confused. I know we go long when stochs are over 80 and short when stochs are below 20 and we have the break of the 0 or 100 Fib Line...so heres my question. I am reading a book for the second time by Dr. Alexander Elder called Trading for a Living and it says "Do not buy when Stochs is overbought and do not sell short when it is oversold. This rule filters out most bad trades." According to this system however that is ehat we are supposed to do right? I am not doubting the system in anyway as I see many people are succesful with it. I am just wondering if I am not understanding something completely. Thank you in Advance....Joe

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Spud has said, in the other thread, that trades within this area have the most momentum. But trades, within the trigger time frame, between 20 and 80 have more movement potential for reversal and therefore more risk. Elder is also correct of course, that is why using spud's method, we exit trades once stoch has crossed back over to 'no-man's land' from 20 or 80 or 23.6, 76.4 respectively.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Spud's other MTF stoch methods take the cross of the 20 and 80 into 'no-man's land' for the trade. I think one can be creative with all the info Spud has given us. I just took a trade using the 30/60 min set up and bounce off 50% fib on price when 30min stoch crossed 76.8 south and hourly stoch was curving under 61.8. I exited off the 5min stoch when it crossed upwards over the 20 line. Having a number of techniques in your arsenal allows you to flexible and possibly adapt certain methods to certain types of market behaviour and moods. Identifying which method for which mood could be an interesting thread.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
You have it bang on Joe! However, here's the one and only reason we trade when stochs are above 80 (actually 76.4) and below 20 (actually 23.6). When price moves big time, it will happen here! Unfortunately, simply trading in these extreme areas every time the stochs enter it is a recipe for disaster. Hence this is why this is called a breakout system. Breakout System I cannot emphasize this enough. This is a break out system. Meaning we are looking for timing...timing of a breakout to happen. It won't always happen but when it does we want to be there to catch it. Along the way we want to minimize losses from trying to catch the breakouts. MTF Stochastics trades the "norm" the area from "20-80"...this is the most dependable trading...this is what we trade when there are no breakouts. If you like, we are now trading the entire stochastic scale in a manner designed to make pips However the rules change when we get above 76.4 and below 23.6 when the fibs are at their extreme with the stochastics. Remember that the fib scale is a representation of the stochastic scale....except that the fib scale is helping us measure price movement and the stochastic scale is helping us measure momentum in a direction of movement. I haven't gone into the topic of the fib scale between 23.6 and 76.4...but a brief glance will tell you that most of the movement is in this range similar to stochastics. Like stochastics there are reliable price moves here. MTF Stochastics is for trading 20-80 on stochastics. MTF Fib Breakout is for trading the above "80" and below "20" extreme. So yes, Dr. Elder is right but only in a limited and basic way with regards to stochastics and I'm sure that his reasoning was to keep people out of trouble....I support the same rule in MTF stochastics because you simply cannot enter every trade above 80 or below 20 without a whole lot of grief following you.....we need to aim for the best possible timing to grab pips in the extreme.

Looks like we should be in a trade Long GBPJPY based on the looks of the charts. 14.3.3 and 5.3.3 crosed above 76.4% on H1 and M30. Price closed above 100% Fib level. TimeFreedom

Harmony, the universe is all about harmony...planets are in harmony with the sun, flowers in harmony with bees...just imagine if bees horded the pollen! Anyways, for purposes of naming a methodology I call this "Harmonic Stochastics" and it should answer a few questions about inner fib levels. Spud's Harmonic Stochastics As mentioned, the fib levels are a representation of the stochastic levels. This is why I emphasized placing the 0 Fib at the bottom and the 100 Fib at the top...so it looks like the stochastic scale. Trading MTF stochastics usually has the huge pitfall of entering too early...because stochastics are by nature an early warning system...price and stochastics work in harmony. So, what if we create a pseudo stochastic indicator with price and fib levels? Add 2 MA's to your price chart: EMA 3 and EMA 6 These represent 30 minutes (3) and 60 minutes (6)....harmony of numbers. (you can play with MA values, but I like 3 and 6 because they make sense in an MTF setting...you just don't want them too large or they become meaningless) The EMA 3 represents the 5,3,3 stochastic and the EMA 6 the 14,3,3 stochastic. On price and the fib levels they behave just like MTF stochastics and all the MTF stochastic rules follow. However, now we have the power of MTF stochastics on price and momentum...(evil laugh). Alrighty let us look at the chart below. It is the 1H chart with the Fib line drawn from lo to high on May 16th 2007. So we are looking at May 17th as our trading day. Notice anything harmonic? Like how the stochastic moves from 23 to 76 and the price moves from 23 to 76? Notice something else? Notice how the stochastic moves first? ---ahhh no wonder we are always early with MTF stochastics! If you read my MTF journal this is the 80/20 rule in true harmony. How can we go wrong with Fib numbers and stochastics?

Hi Spudfyre Ih your opinion is it better to hand draw the fibs than use the indicator? Because the indicator automatically draws the day before and there was no trade yesterday. Senbanda

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Personally, I hand draw everything and use each time chart as it is more accurate in my opinion...tedious but better.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
A little discretionary but if you were in it short, you'd have a good idea what to do.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Looks like you could have doubled up your trades on that one. Excellent opportunity to get in at the near bounce off the 0.00 fibs level on price with both 30/60 stochs breaking through the 23 level north. Then enter another trade as fib hits through 100 price level and stoch through the 76 level....piptastic!!

Hi Spud, I have a dear friend that cannot clear her trades through the bank due to asset minimums. Which retail broker do you recommend? I have seen negative reviews on many of them. Thanks in advance, PiPr Pro

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I can't make recommendations, but I can tell you who I use and my experience. I use FXCM and Man Financial which just moved me to FXCM UK due to Canadian margin rules. Although I have read lots of negative things about FXCM, I have never experienced anything bad and their service has been outstanding. FXCM UK is new to me, so will have to see but Man Financial was very good to me too. I have had no issues with either broker...other than technical about twice a year...but they have honoured and covered losses from trades due to those difficulties on a voluntary basis without me having to call them on it.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thank you and understood. I previously utilized GFT for some monies outside work and only had 1 (maybe 2) issues with them during very volatile time frames (i.e. - more my fault than theirs). 99% of the time they were consistent. But, the Introducing Broker spread increase (8 pips G-yen) can raise the spread too high for someone trying to take say 10 to 15 pips as I am teaching my friend until she has more experience. Thanks

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Very nice template, but when I try to turn off fibs on higher time frames it resets. Is there a way to make it stick? thanks, Brett

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi guys, I am struggling with this chart posted by spud. From what I can see: the price drops dramatically and retraces in the following bar. As the opening price (after the drop) is below the previous day low, and the stochs are both below the 23.6 mark, should this not dictate a short entry? -I am looking at the chart in context of this thread (breakout system). Am I missing the significance of the 2 x MA's? If so please could someone enlighten me. Regards Paul.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi spud could you please tell me if we should wait for bar close to exit or exit if the stoch just goes above 23.6 or below 76.4 i understand that the safest way to enter is to wait for bar close. With Many Thanks David-T

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Spud, I need to clear something up please. You mention in your basic techniques to exit at the 80 for long or 20 for short, levels. However, for the fib breakout you exit when price crosses back over 80 or 20. Firstly, if there is opportunity for more pips when price crosses back over (after penetrating the area), why is the exit strategy different for the basic system compared with the fib breakout system? Secondly, which line do we rely on for the exit, the 14,3,3 or the 5,3,3. Many thanks for your hard work.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I've included a graphic that may clear up your question. Once we cross the 76.3 or 23.6 boundaries we are into a different world than the area between 23.6 and 76.3. So the rules change. My example was just showing one segment of trades but in the dip you would have applied the Fib Breakout rules when price closed below 0.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
You can do both, but I suggest bar close. Bar close takes out any discretion. Having said that, there are live circumstances that make discretionary trades obvious at the time and the more experience you are trading these methods the more obvious they become. For "argument" sake or for lack of "arguments" I state using the close so there are no discretionary moves....especially when you back test. I would estimate that by trading with discretion which is more prone to error and simply using the closes will make little difference to the bottom line in the long run.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Your question is probably answered in post 124, but I'll address it just in case. Stochastics do not function in the same way above 80 or below 20 as they do between the 20-80 area. This is because stochastics are extremely reluctant to hit 0 or 100....how many times do you see it? (almost never). In otherwords, there is no reliable way to read stochastics above 80 or below 20...a move up or down in these extreme zones are full of divergences or fakes and have almost no visual relation to price moves. However when the stochastics leave these extreme zones we are back into the "normal" world where stoch moves and price relate. The 14,3,3 exit on the 1H crossing below 80 or above 20 is a "slow" average of the stochastic when it was in the extreme zones and therefore is our most reliable source as an exit signal when trading the fib breakout. When trading between the 23.6 and 76.4 zone the best move is to "get out" of a normal trade as the time frames start hitting the extreme entry ranges of either 23.6 or 76.4. The problem of the extreme range before price levels cross the 0 or 100 Fib and stochs are floating in the extreme zones is that the stochastics are extremely unstable. This means that just about anything can happen. If you trade long, say from 23.6 (using the 80/20 rule) and then hit 76.4, you can either exit and wait for a Fib Breakout, use the Fib breakout exit rule when the 1H 14,3,3 recrosses 76.4 (and hope a breakout occurs inbetween), or exit and then re-enter when the breakout rules come into play.

Spudfyre, Can you show us yesterday's GBPJPY long trade and today's GBPUSD long trade to help us confirm these trades? Thanks in advance, TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi Spud, I want to confirm if this is a valid entry from earlier today on the GY. Price closed above the 100 fib, and the 5.3.3 and 14.3.3 stochs were above the 76.4 level. If so and this is a valid entry, then we should be up 120ish pips since the 14.3.3 has yet to cross back down over the 76.4 level. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
When I load this templete I do not get the stoch panes, is there something more that I need to do? Thanks!

Sorry for this stupid question, but how do you get the charts to show two stoch windows (one for H1 time frame and one for M30 time frame)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks for the cool image Spud. But doesn't that confirm the short entry from post #111? [IMG]file:///C:/WIP/MA2.jpg[/IMG]

--- 帖子 #139 ---
My apologies, I had thought I had put this in the Forum but I had answered in a PM. Anyways, my scale ends at +200 and -100 for good reason, this is where I pretty much limit my trading as the number of times price exceeds these boundaries is quite rare. Although this meets the criteria for signals, the fib break is well done before we get a signal to enter, so best to wait for the next one. In this example the break is almost at -76,4 before we get a signal, leaving little room for pip gains.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Spud, thanks so much for this system--I'm super excited about it and have been backtesting some today, and look forward to testing this in the coming weeks! So from what I've gathered, we have two types of trades: 1) Breakout trade--when price breaks above 100 or below 0 on our fibs, and both stoch TFs (1H and 30M) confirm with &gt; 76.4 for price above fib100, or &lt; 23.6 for price below fib 0. Close trade when 1H 14,3,3 stoch crosses back into regular territory (&lt; 76.4 for exiting a long trade, &gt; 23.6 for exiting a short trade). Correct? 2) This is the one I'm unsure about--Fib/stoch harmony--when stochs are going in the same direction as price, at a similar fib level (for example, price goes from the 23.6 fib level up, and stochs are going up at the 23.6 fib level as well). I'm not really clear on this, but am I on the right track? If the "80/20 rule" is what you took on Feb 9, then that seems to conflict with the standard breakout rule for crossing below the 23 stoch line... or am I confused? Also, I'm a little fuzzy on the "50 bounce" rule... I guess those are in your journal, and I'm headed there to check out the thread now. But if it's not, can you briefly describe what you mean? One last thing--though you mentioned the 3 and 6 MAs, I haven't yet seen you use them--did I miss an example?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi guys I'd like to share this little indicator that I created, it simply alert when price breaks the 0/100 Fibo lines and both stoch(5,3,3) and (14,3,3) for both M30 and H1 timeframe are above 76.4 or below 23.6. Hope it could help your trading with MTF Spud's systems http://www.divshare.com/download/724154-183

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Skyline, Excellent. Nice simple alert indicator. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I'll address this with more examples. For 80/20 rule, 50 rule and Escalator to Pips --you MUST read MTF Stochastic in my FF journal to have any idea of what it means. I will post charts here but not re-explain those rules here....these rules are more than well documented in the journal. MA's are part of Harmonic Stochastics.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Looks like we have a SHORT setting up on USDCAD. 14.3.3 and 5.3.3 are both below 23.6% on H1 and M30. Now we wait for a bar/candle close below Fib level 0. Note: We have news coming out shortly that could help with the breakout, but can also hurt the entry. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Here is a chart from Aug 3, 2006 for a Fib breakout. Notice that the 1H and 30M stochastics are not above 76.4. However, a trained eye in stochastics would recognize this as a fairly reliable up pattern. To filter, we can use the 4H chart and check those stochastics which are above 76.4. The longer the time frame the more influential the signal. We can also look at the moving averages. Although they haven't crossed the 100 level on the price chart, they are very close.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Here is Aug 4, 2006. Looks almost identical to August 3rd.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Skyline, The indicator doesn't refresh. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Here is Aug 2, 2006. This is much more complicated and help show the use of multiple time frames in trading. Wait for the ducks to line up and you will have less failures. The first trade (1) is a typical 80/20 rule opportunity except that in the 80/20 rule the 4H must be in agreement. In this casei t is not so there is no trade entry with the 80/20 rule. There are also no Harmonic Stochastics with the MA's in the price with the Fib level...the MA's are high at 61.8 Fib level when the stochastics are crossing at 23.6. So overall there is a lot going against the first trade to use the 80/20 rule. The second trade adds more complexity. We have what appears a perfect Fib Breakout when price crosses 100 and the 1H and 30M stochastics are above 76.4. However the 4H stochastic is sagging below 76.4. Also, notice the MA's in the price never cross 100. So here we had a choice. Go with the FIB Breakout rules and suffer a small lose when the 1H 14,3,3 stochastic crossed down below the 76.4 level....or use the 4H and/or MA's as an added filter. The problem with too many filters is that we will miss many trades that are good. The statistics behind the Fib Breakout rules is that those rules will encounter less wins but the losses are small enough to have little effect on net pips. However, using the filters and having them confirm entries like on Aug 3 and 4th can offer us the opportunity to be a more efficient trader...perhaps when the added filters confirm entry we trade extra lot on that entry. Perhaps we just sit and wait for perfect entries if we can't stand losses. Again as we practice we "see" more and recognize these patterns and they help us determine our best entries. The rules as I lay them out are defined to provide simple trading strategies that statistically, if followed properly, should result in positive pips over the long run. However, all these rules follow some very few and basic concepts that are based on MTF stochastics. MTF stochastics is based on core fundamentals of stochastics. All these fundamentals can be used together to signal and filter trades. Some of us will be artists with these tools and others can't hammer a nail straight...the more we practice with the tools the better we will be using them.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
GBP/CHF looking like a set-up coming...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Here's a Harmonic Stochastics example. Remember that the Fib scale on the price chart represents the stochastic scale in a stochastic indicator. The EMA 3 represents the 5,3,3 "%K" line and the EMA 6 represents the 14,3,3 "%K" line. We can use Harmonic Stochastics when the "price stochastic" lines up with the "true" stochastic indicators. You can see in the chart below, that as usual the "true" stochastic indicators lead the way of the "price" stochastic to give us an indication to trade a long from 23.6 to 76.4 (80/20 rule). In this example after the stochastics broke through 76.4 we switch to the FIB Breakout rules. Choices are to stay in the trade at the breach of 76.4 or exit and re-enter as per the Fib breakout rules. With Harmonic STochastics we are always looking for the "price" stochastics to line up with the "true" stochastics to make some pip music. This always trades in the range between 23.6 and 76.4 and follows the rules of MTF Stochastics as explained in my journal.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
thank you for the explanation Spud. nice example. one question here, according to the above example of Harmonic Stochastic, it means that 4 hOur Stoch will be totally ignored for confirmation? am i right abt this spud?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I didn't chart it, but we could. The 4H was making indications of rising above 23.6. In this case, say the 4H was at around 61.8-50 and coming down, I would probably question the entry. If the 4H was above 76.4 I'd enter without a doubt. If the 4H was rising anywhere between 23.6 and 76.4, I'd enter. With the 4H below 23.6 and rising...chances are pretty good still but I am then weighing statistics over the 4H and most times I'll go with statistics and grab the trade on the 1H and 30M with price data.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
There is a problem with the MTF_Stochastic indicator. See the attached chart. The bottom stoch is a true 30M stoch on a 30M chart. This is what it should look like. The top stoch is from the posted indicator. See how different it is? That's because the author simply did a bar-for-bar mapping, and as you can tell, the top two rightmost periods of the faulty indicator match the single bottom rightmost period for the true indicator. So, I have coded the stoch in the middle, and it matches as closely as possible the true 30M stoch. There will be some deviations simply because the number of bars to plot the points is half of what it should be, so the line looks smoother than the true 30M stochs. This is the only way it can be unless you have two separate charts. It's not perfect, it will work for higher-to-lower TFs (like a 4HR chart with any lower TF), but it probably doesn't quite work for 1D-to-4HR charts, and it definitely does NOT work for lower-to-higher TFs. But I'll post it so people can have a correct indicator to work with.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Spud, I notice you are using 76.4 as a fib level are you sure that's correct? I thought the closest to 80 should be 78.6. Also, thanks for this interesting system which I've applied to Amibroker.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
For what it's worth 76.4 is the fib number I have been using for years also it is the invert of 23.6.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Well, actually 78.6 is not a fib number either. .236, .318, .618 are the actual fib numbers, and .5 and .786 are used anyway. But lots of traders use it. I'd say I've seen more traders use 78.6 versus 76.4, which is what matters. But they're pretty close either way.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Yes, your right. None of the the numbers you and I quoted are fib numbers. Fib numbers are actually integers. But we traders tend to use ratios of fib's although I don't think using the ratios is the best way of using fib values for determining a TP. I prefer to use the integer value. Sorry to have taken this thread off topic. I won't say any more about this.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Actually it was a good question so here's how we come to use 76.4 and 23.6: The Fibonacci number sequence is: {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, ... } It is the first number + the next number equals the 3rd number....so 233+377 = 610 Since stochastics are on a percentage range from 0-100, I wanted the Fibonacci numbers in the price chart to represent 0-100% as well. I also wanted to use a scale based on Fibonacci...because I love Fibonacci numbers. So to get a percentage with Fibonacci numbers one must divide a group of numbers that derived the Fibonacci numbers....so 233+377 = 610 then 233/610=0.382 and 377/610 = 0.618. As you can see we will always get 100% this way...0.382+0.618 = 1 is the same in percentage as 233+377=610. So to get 76.4 and 23.6 (which are Fibonacci percentages): Take the sequence 144,233,377,610 144/610 = 0.236 and to get 76.4 take the sequence 89,144,233,377,610 (89+144+233)/610 = 0.764 There's more to it, without explaining how numbers converge the Fibonacci numbers always converge to (in percent); 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 76.4% so 23.6%+76.4% =100% 38.2%+61.8%=100%

are the live trading sessions still being held? if so, where?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Spud I am really leaning toward your 20 pip/day idealogy. Nickel and diming for steady profits is the best approach, if you ask me. Many folks taut 120 and 50 pip gains, but over time I am thinking 20 is just fine. Take Collective2's ExtremeOS system. The goal is to make a VERY small gain each and every day. Who wouldn't want an equity curve that looks like this? To each their own I guess. I am following Breakout more carefully now, and applaud the work you've done.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I am happy you see the wisdom of the 20 pip a day approach. So many people believe it is a limitation but I feel it is the exact opposite. Unfortunately to know this is to use it. Glad I could help.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I apologize that I haven't been trading "live" as much as I would like as I wrap up some documentation. However live trading does go on at www.tradingrooms.com in the MTF Traders room and I will get back to it in my trading journal next week to summarize trades and to indicate trade opportunities I will enter. I hope to have the documentation done for this weekend and get back to trading. I will still be much focused on GJ as this is my favorite pair to trade. I may trade other pairs just to show the systems but in my "normal" realm of life I would only trade GJ. You will see me most active during live trades just before a trading event happens...most noteably GJ, I am not too active on Fridays as I don't like to carry trades over the weekend...but will usually trade Friday morning 6 am - noon. I do trade on Sunday evening but typically I am watching to gear up for the week...but if opportunity arises I will take it. My weekly trading is done usually from 6 am to noon est and 7 pm-midnight est.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Sorry, I meant to say that the numbers I gave were ratios, not the actual numbers in the integer sequence. My point was that .786 or .764 are not fib ratios.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
We all would--unfortunately the realism factor as rated by c2 on this is in the 60's--not good at all. TeamAphid has a system on c2 that has done quite well so far, has a beautiful equity curve, and has a realism factor of 100--in other words, it actually works in real life. Not trying to promote them, just emphasizing that there's a difference between theory and practice.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
SpudFyre, how is the activity in your experience during the 7-midnight hours versus the 6-noon hours? I'm looking to establish some solid trading hours and those were two of my options--what is your opinion?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I have no trouble finding trades between 7-midnight....usually watching GBPJPY. The market is obviously slower but still plenty of good opportunities. It also allows me to see if waking up at 3 am is going to be necessary or if I can just sleep. Even if I'm not getting any trades those evening hours set the tone for the next day and I usually "see" more from the market the next day having watched last night's moves.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
The first one worked for higher timeframes, JoshDance's worked for lower timeframes, so I figured the next logical step would be one that works for all timeframes. To top it off, I included linear interpolation for higher timeframes, so they don't look as rugged anymore! Let's hope it works live, as the market is closed right now.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Spud, I did not take this short trade thankfully. A few hours later the price turned long. Would you care to comment on the attached chart for 21 March 2007. The top chart is H1, the middle chart is M30 and the lower chart is H4. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Another potential trade on 21 March I did not take. Can you comment here also?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I am a little confused or perhaps I have confused people? I marked on your chart the indications but this is indicating a long entry. You indicate you were looking for a short trade from this?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I assuming you were looking for a short entry here too? Again this would have been a long entry where price crossed the and closed above 100 and all stochs on all 3 time frames are crossing or above 76.4.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Here's my take on the MArch 21st entry for a long break out. The moving averages above 100 Fib level is a good sign for an entry. The price closed above 100 Fib level The stochastics on 30M, 1H and 4H are all above 76.4 The 1H time frame trade would have lost 17 pips + spread since the 1H 14,3,3 stochastic came back across 76.4 The 4H time frame trade would have had an opportunity to grab over 100 pips before the 4H 14,3,3 stochastic crossed 76.4. If we were greedy then we ran the 4H stoch to 14,3,3 cross and lost 39 pips. The end result was that there was no real breakout here and with the 1H as our standard exit point we would have lost 17 pips + spread on this one.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
From the various communications I have had with other traders, it is difficult for those working or who cannot trade full time to use some of my methods. As such I've been developing a 4 hour trading method of the MTF FIB Breakout system, which I call MTF FIBOx4. It provides the option of using the 4 hour close and 4H time frame trade window so that the trader need only check every 4 hours for trade entry/exit. It also includes some upgrades I have been working on to help filter trades. This system also includes the 1H exit strategy as well. FIBOx4 Rules: 3 time frames: 4H, 1H, 30M Entries are on 4H close only Indicator checklist: Price must cross and close above 100 or below 0 Fibonacci as per regular MTF Fibonacci rules Moving Averages must be near, close to or already above the 100 or below the 0 Fibonacci. "Near" means it appears the MA's will cross. This is more common on the 4H time frame. It is best that either the 1H or 4H time frame has the MA's across before entering a trade. Stochastics should be above 76.4 with price above 100 or below 23.6 with price below 0. More emphasis is with the 14,3,3 stochastic than the 5,3,3 stochastic. It is viable to enter with the 5,3,3 not in the entry range, but best to have at least 2 time frames with all stochs in the entry range. Candle Indicator: This is new. Simply any candle with the same open and close price on the 4H or 1H that appears at or before entry is a good sign for the trade. This is a "feel good" indicator rather than a decision making indicator, so don't restrict entry in a trade if the CI is not present. Exit options are: When you have made some good pips. 4H when 14,3,3 crosses 76.4 down (long) or 23.6 up (short). 1H when 14,3,3 crosses 76.4 down (long) or 23.6 up (short). When MA's reach +200 or -100 When price crosses +200 or -100 Best exit is always being pip positive! So use trailing stops or move the stops up to keep some profit if we don't want to risk taking a loss. Some Tips: I find the MA's to be more important than price for crossing. Price candles almost always touch the MA's, so when entering and exiting trades this information is useful for timing. If the entry at close of candle is too far (i.e. above 150 or below -50) it may be a good idea to pass on the trade as "bad timing" since there won't be many pips to grab anyways. If trend continues we will grab the break on the next day and timing may be better. Entry can be made on 1H close with 30M support. The green area on the chart represents the 1H entry and exit and the green and yellow areas combined are the 4H entry and exit.

Hi Spud - thanks a bunch - because I had been working so many hours on charts I was not clear. On the first chart, I did take the long trade but did not close out and take the 80/20 trade short because the more conservative entry of H4 was not in agreement with the H1 &amp; M30. As you know, there had been a string of great trades in March, this was one of the rare trades that was tough or slightly negative. Now that I have made this more clear do you care to comment on whether you would have gone short after the long trade. In other words when the H1-14,3,3 crosses back over the 76.4 and the MTF Stochs are tight and in sync with one another heading down, do you normally take the reverse in the short direction? If so, may I assume you only take the reverse if the H4 is in agreement? Thank you in advance.

Hi I got new indicator from my friend. I opened that using Microsoft Word by mistake. Now all custom indicators have turned to word icon. I download again that new indicator but it turns to word from original mql. It's causing me big frustration. I need help. Thanks

I typically don't trade the short on an exit by the 1H 14,3,3. I prefer to have the 4H 14,3,3 signal the beginning and enter when the 1H and 30M line up with the 4H. It's more successful that way.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
thanks again

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Spud does it again. Another great way to trade. This will be great to advise a friend learning to trade.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thanks for this indi iya. Looks good so far. Lets hope it makes Spuds strategies easier to follow on more pairs. G-Man

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I also like the modification you made to the MTF indicator. Now it's much easier to see where the higher time frames have been and and the direction they're moving. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I hope you like it! The repainting of the current candle wasn't as flawless as I thought, but this version should now look and move as close to the actual stochastic from another timeframe as possible:

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Thanks for your work on the indicator but I don't think the adjustments you made in post 184 are working properly. I watched the 4HR time frame stay bellow the 80 line then jumping across when 4HR candle closed. Then when I put my curser arrow to the stoch line just past the break of the 80 line, it shows that the 80 line was crossed several hours earlier (which I know wasn't true since I was watching it). Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I think this lies in the nature of stochastics: they will jump on the formation of a new candle. Things to remember are: the interpolated values are for display only. This are not the values, the stochastic had at these times, because at higher timeframes these times do not exist (on the chart). The values from candle close times should be correct, of course. I also made the active candle from a higher timeframe extend to the current time (of the lower chart), because this way the current values will get displayed. Hope this helps. Any suggestions are welcome, of course.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I think what we would ideally want is the MTF stochs to display the same number of bars for each of the timeframes selected on that chart, e.g. you have a 30 min chart displaying 40 bars, and you want the last 40 bars of the hourly chart and the last 40 bars of the 4hr chart. These would of course relate to a longer time period. I don't think that this is possible with MT4, but I'm not a coder so I am probobly not best placed to judge. I actually think that the more blocky MTF stochastic may be more beneficial, where the longer term stochs are displayed for the number of lower timeframe bars that value relates to: i.e. on a 30 min chart the same value is displayed for the last 2 bard for hourly and last 8 bars for 4 hour. G-Man

--- 帖子 #188 ---
You're correct. Ideally that's what we want, but we just can't get it that way. The absolutely best setup is different chart windows, although what you mention in the last paragraph is valid also (30 min chart, 1 hour stochs, for example). The only way to have the best view is to line multiple windows up and zoom accordingly. The fact is that while it's more convenient to have more than 1 TF on a chart, anything more than 1 level of difference (say, a 15-min stoch on a 1-hr chart, 2 levels difference) basically defeats the purpose, as you can't get a picture of what the lower TF stochs are doing at the moment. Even a 30M stoch on a 1HR chart loses much of its effectiveness.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Well said. It is a pain to flip time frames or have multiple charts but it is the only way to view stochastics effectively. Trying to display mutliple time frames on one chart is like trying to watch 3 movies at the same time...you can do it, but you miss much. Best to use the MTF on one chart just to watch for line ups and then switch to the individual time frames for trading.

Somebody requested adding a timeshift option to the #SpudFibo indicator, so here it is. You can input a start hour and select the timezone between server time, local time and GMT! The defaults will continue to use your broker's daily candle. Another update: You can now select the timeframe from which the High and Low is taken for the fib calculations; e.g. for weekly and monthly fibs. Only MT4 standard timeframes, and no timeshift for other than daily atm.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Skyline is it possible to add the following to the indicator you have already programmed: 1. - add to the indicator the rules for an 80/20 entry. I have written an EA with this but only use this for backtesting and would like the indicator to alert with the text message either for the MTF Fibo Breakout or alert for 80/20 rule 2. - add to the indicator a simple 14,3,3 stochastic moving back across the min / max line or better yet a 14,3,3 stochastic that sends an alert any time it crosses back over any of the stochastic level lines. This function must be able to be turned on and off so that after we are in a trade and want to catch some sleep until the 14,3,3 indicator stops moving in the appropriate direction we simply turn the 14,3,3 portion of the indicator on (true) for the respective direction needed. As stated above I have most of the code written already but do not know how to add to the great indicator you have created. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Also Skyline, if you are able to add this to the indicator; in regard to the 80/20 rule I have an idea how to program something that is helpful for win/loss trade percentage in my trading. the M30 &amp; H1 must agree as spud has stated in his new thread http://forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=31790 and also the 3rd time frame H4 should have a trend by angle that is either long for long trades (short for short trades) or no greater than +- 10 degrees. i.e. if the trade direction is long on M30 &amp; H1 then the H4 last 4 hours must have a trend by angle no less than 350 degrees. If H1 &amp; M30 indicate short then the H4 must either be short also or a trend by angle of no greater than 10 degrees. Again thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Pipr Pro , i'm a little busy in these days, I'll see if I could code what you are asking. cya, Skyline

Note the graph this post and the next post: I have utilized a stop loss approach for some time when price reaches known fib levels and begins to consolidate. Once consolidation occurs I see alot of traders close the trade but often I watch consolidaion occur then the stock resumes the trend. I have seen everything mentioned on other threads from sell half your position and let the other run, etc. My experience has been the best way to maximize the returns and pay less pips to the broker are simple. I do not use a trailing stop unless I just HAVE TO SLEEP and then I use a BIG trailing stop. Rarely. Otherwise once I receive my sell trigger I begin to raise the stops to immediately below the appropriate candle and continue raising this "tight stop" with each candle. The next time trend consolidates and drops below the previous bar close more than a few pips I am out. What I really like about this is the ability to check back in every hour to simply raise the stop to below the closing bar low. Without getting into the fib consolidation you can achieve approximately the same results with Spud's Fib Stochastic. TRUE HARMONY!! I have incorporated Spud's 14,3,3 H1 closing technique with great results. I have spent the last few days backtesting and live trading this and wanted to share with you those results. This will improve both your win/loss ratio and total pips gained without you having to become an expert in fib analysis. Summary: (for a long trade) wait until the H1 14,3,3 at bar close breaks the 76.4 to the downside. Instead of closing the position immediately, place a stop 3-10 pips below the low of the candle that just completed. The stop will be below the candle that corresponds to the H1 14,3,3 break of the 76.4. Then at the close of each H1 candle simply raise the stop to below the low of the candle each hour. Results: often the trade will simply be stopped out and you lose a few pips (3-10) from where you could have sold out quickly. But this technique will often give you 20-200 more pips simply because price consolidates and then resumes the trend. In the example of the AUDUSD trade yesterday and today had you closed the trade immediately upon the H1 14,3,3 retracement you would have had a "breakeven" trade. Utilizing the stop loss technique above you would have made 30 pips. If you had a bit of understanding about support and resistance of the daily high you would have made 60 pips. ENJOY !!

Spud et al I have been reading this forum since the first day and am really impressed by the results, it has blown lots of other systems I have been looking into and paper trading to bits! The last week being pip-tastic! I finally feel I have enough knowledge to stump up some of my own cash and was wondering which brokers for MT4 people use and who offers the best spread in GBP/JPY? I have seen Alpari who are UK based like myself and they offer 7pips, is this the best? Any information greatly appreciated. Keep up the excellent work Spud

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi webdevjeff, FastbrokersFX get with 6 pips spreads on GBPJPY, it's very low compared to other brokers If you want more information just drop me a pm

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Oanda has just lowered their spreads recently, and I see a 4 pip spread on gbp/jpy more often. You could always use any MT4 platform for the charting, and use another broker for trading. I think Oanda is prob one of the better choices or retail brokers if you are starting out, mainly due to the total flexibility in the units per trade. Just another option for you to look at. Cheers. K.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
After looking at this chart and comparing it to mine, I realized we had identical feeds, yet I'm having a hard time coming up with the 375 pips you mention which makes me think I'm missing something with my entry or exits. If I understand correctly (which you clearly state two or three posts later) you should enter on the open of the next bar after the cross of the 0 and 23.6 lines. You then exit when the 14,3,3 crosses back up above the 23.6. Now given that you only see the stoch values associated with price at the close of a bar, I'm guessing you're talking about the close? In this case I can see only 150 pips. If I closed out at the open of the bar I'd be at 264 pips. I don't mean to be anal about this, as in any rate it was a good trade, but I wanted to make sure I was clearly seeing things your way. How did you come by 375 pips for this trade? My platform is on FXDD which showed identical bars and stochs.. Thanks, Jason Note: I'm referring to post 39 if you want to see the image.

I actually peg the trade around 600 pips but I was actually trying to cut the pips down a bit taking into account missing perfect entries and such. Only error I can think of is perhaps you have the Fibs in the wrong spot? Here's a simplified chart:

I think you are suppose to use the H1 charts for the Fib. break-outs. oo7_ts

--- 帖子 #211 ---
The FIB breakout system is like a slot machine...plug your nickel in and pull....so you need to trade every trade opportunity or you will likely miss the one trade that breaks out and makes you the big pips. Oh....the odds are way better on the breakout system! Don't second guess it...just pull when you have the opportunity to pull. Your losing nickels against large pip gains....just don't stop once you start..until you win. This is why I tend to stick just to GBPJPY as I can follow it easily...but that's me.

I use fibs but slightly different, I use extension levels as well:- 14 = 86 fib this level extends to 118 21.4 = 78.6 " " " " 127 38.2 = 61.8 " " " " 161.8 50 = 50 " " " " 161.8 61.8 = 38.2 " " " " 161.8 Attached File(s) fib EUR.doc 76 KB | 723 downloads and 0 and 100 are used at the highs and lows. If the trend is going long I pull the fib from High to low-(not always of the day) and if the trend is short I pull the Fib in the opposite direction. If the market retraces to a 382, 50 or 618 and gives an entry signal I set my final limit 10 pips off the 1618 extention, other limits may be set at 1.5 x risk, 5-10 pips off the high or low (depending on deriection) if greater than the 1.5 limit, 5-10 pips off the 127 extension as the market tends to find resistance and sometimes revers from there. by doing this I secure profit all the way to my final limit. The result of the trade see chart

--- 帖子 #219 ---
As I understand the author's last changes in the strategy, signal - is both MAs (not price) cross of yesterdays fibs. So you had not to take this trade. Please correct me if I undestand the situation wrong. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
This chart may help you see the trade better (I've removed some things for clarity). This is a chart with the 15M,30M,1H and 4H stochastics on it. The red shaded area is when the trade should have been - a short from the 100 to 0 Fibonacci. The bounce is tradeable but riskier since we don't have the 4H stochastic with us. Here you might have aimed for 0-50 on the Fib scale and only adjust to go higher if the 4H turned up with the rest. Otherwise, probably leaving the bounce trade would have been a good idea. The odds of the price dropping below zero dwindled when the 15/30/1H crossed up over 23.6. So the best trade here was from 100 to 0 and call it the day. The breakout at the 100 up earlier on should have had us going long and we should have suffered at worst only a few pips lost by the time we saw the stochastics and the 4H trend going against us. If we were on our game we might have even grabbed a few pips from that quick long. Either way, the losses from that move would be insignificant to short that followed. The move from 100 to 0 in the stochastics is actually the perfect "Escalator to Pips" move that I discuss in my journal.

thx spud for excelent thread, I took my first trade on GBPJPN - blue line

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi Spudfyre In the above chart you have stochastics of all time frames in one chart. Is it a new indicator? If so I missed seeing it in the thread. Would you kindly direct me to the page. Thank you Senbanda

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Here's today's chart. The stochastics favour the price will keep going down after the zero break. The thing to watch for is if our 15/30/1H stocks rise up above 23.6 and if the 4H is still going downwards or starts to turn up at the next close. The 1H is still strong below 23.6. The 15M and 30M may whipsaw. We should know direction IF the price comes back to 0 and where the stochs are. PS. This is GBPJPY and in my rush to get the chart out I put the Fib in backwards....so the break line is the 0 line.

--- 帖子 #224 ---

colud you please attach. tpl your last picture??? thx bj on GBBPUSD on 4 hour now down?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I'm sorry I should have explained the stochastics in the chart. The stochastics are all 14,3,3 (%K line only). Each is period is taken from its period chart...so 15M is taken from 15M chart, 30M from 30M chart and so on. I have then cut and pasted them onto one chart using a graphics program. I am hoping that this provides everyone with a little more clarity in seeing multiple time frame stochastics and how they work together. Unfortunately there is no indicator yet that can produce this kind of chart where the real stochastics for each time frame are accurately represented. I believe this is a huge short-coming in trading platforms given the importance of multiple time frame trading.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Spud, I want to ask one more question Its about this situation: Here's that day: http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/2558/votqg8.gif Enter setup is big vertical line. Stochs' rise over 23,6 - small vertical lines. Current (H1 for Gbp/Jpy) stoch rise up also. But H4-stoch is still going down. What do we had to do in that situation? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Do I undertand you right that you make a new rule of trading inside the previous day's fib? If so could you please show one more example with the concrete definition of this new idea? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Even if it says my setup I do not do something different than Spud. I put on my screen all time frames one next to the other one because I have 2 screens and I have plenty of room. Since I am only looking what is happening the precise moment I do not need to stack them. For backtesting it would help to pile them. Then I save it as a template with the name of the pair. I have a mouse that has two extra buttons that you can program. So I assigned the value of F5 (function F5) to the extra mouse buttons. So when I press these buttons I can move from one template to the next, ie. moving from one currency to the next. I find this useful for me and someone might also find it useful. Regards

Here's chart with 6EMA (more conservative then 3) and stoch14,3,3 (more conservative then 5,3,3). http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/8098/votjq9.gif Price crosses fib at 1st vertical line. MA - at 2nd. Two questions: 1. MA's cross with fib is lagging. Sometime we can take some pips, sometime - SL. When do we have to wait MA cross fib and when do we have to wait price cross fib only? 2. Stoch is over 76,4 at the signal moment. But it's there for a long time already. Have we to take this trade or have we to wait for the setups when MA-fib-cross and Stoch-76,4-cross became at almost same time? Thank you!

Hi Aktaurus Will attach the charts when I get back from work. It was a Long and it was my trailing stops that pulled the trade at 241.91, which was a good point as we are currently down at 240.96, will be analysing the charts when I get back to see if there would have been a good Escaltor entry here for a sell. I hope to set my email alerts up this weekend so I can catch more trades during work hours :-) Regards Jeff.......

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Here's the solution, for all who want to backtest the system but are too lazy to draw the fibs. I simply converted the #SpudFibo indicator into a script, that uses the rightmost bar of your chart as the "current" bar, to draw the fibs and display the stoch values. So, put the F12 key to good use and have fun! http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/1...testingnx0.gif

Hey Spud, I have been following your thread(s) since the very beginning. You have been tremendous. Thank you! As far as the chart on post #220, what graphics program did you use to cut and paste the different time frame stochiastics and how did you do it? Adding the “true” stochs on one chart really gives a clearer picture on how the basics of your system works. Thanx in advance J. Stone

Hi aktaurus Came in where the green dots start, on the red dotted stoch (5,3,3) I then trailed my stops by fib levels and then exited 76.4 (or 241.91) I use Banzai's latest and greatest (Thanks banzai) as I prefer the Fib drawings, but I follow spud rules (chuckle mostly for entries, ie sometimes speculative according to volativity). Would be really chuffed for spud to layour the ground on this 100 pip escalator as a learner though!

Spud, Just like to say thanks, your systems have actually been the first impetus for me to move from paper to money. Yes my own money. Have paper traded now on various systems for over a year and this has for me had the best risk/reward for the amount of time and money I can put into it. I have not the luxury of being able to trade all day as I am a computer programmer (chuckle) for FX markets (get a good kick of news though!) But with a few email alerts and just missing a few pips in good trending(fib sys) and even rangng (80/20 esc) it is possible to rack up some excellent pips. Fulfills the KISS (Keep It stupid simple) prinicples perfectly and with everyone elses participation (Banzai, Iya, Skyline, BrandJt et Al) makes it easier and accessible. Spud and the rest you are a gems (olde London cockney speak for good olde fellows!) Thanks...................Jeff......

Here's a broader picture of what is happening with MTF STochastics included. We can see that the 4H stochastic is down trending and the first opportunity for a short entry comes with a "Escalator to Pips" trade entry when the 15M/30M/1H stochastic cross the 76.4 line headed towards the 4H stochastic. By the time our stochastics reach 23.6 we are in a great position where the 4H has crossed the 23.6 and the price has broken 0 Fibonacci. As well we have the 15M/30M/1H all crossing 23.6 a the same time the EMA 6 crosses. So to get an early set up is to trade MTF stochastics (Escalator to Pips) and we are then in a huge advantage to continue the short entry.

Here's a really good chart and although it does not show a FIB breakout, it shows why there was no FIB breakout and the other trades that could have been made in a 2 day period. At the start of June 5th the 4H stochastic is below the 23.6 level meaning we are in a down trend. The 15/30/1H are all spaggetti up near the 76.4 level but they have not converged so there is no short trade there. If we missed the convergence and traded short it didn't hurt us. The 4H crossed up at 23.6 meaning we are now in a long trade situation. The 15/30/1H converge and cross the 76.4 up with the 4H rising. In this circumstance this is a good long trade opportunity when the 4H is climbing. So we have a long trade here until the 1H crosses back down below 76.4 It looks like we could pull an escalator to pips trade with the 15/30/1H crossing the 76.4 headed down but the 4H is way too high to make a short trade. Again if you entered the short trade it wouldn't have hurt you....but that is a risky trade. When the 15/30/1H cross the 23.6 on the way back up, the 4H is still high and in a long rising stance, so this would have been a signal to go long in an escalator trade. When any of the 15/30 or 1H hit 76.4 it would be time to exit since the 4H was falling and we had good pips. There is a possible short entry with the reverse of the 1H but it doesn't quite cross the 76.4 line but the 4H is crossing the 50 level and falling, so this would have been a short but not clear entry. Watching all this happening would have given some good indications timing a Fib Breakout but even without a breakout there was plenty of opportunity to pip. When the 4H stochastic is on the move like this, trading can be a little trickier and playing the 15/30/1H going from 20 to 80 and back to 20 will give good returns....just follow the 4H.

Spud, First let me thank you for your unconditional generosity...... I have been studying the MTF Stoch approach and I have one basic question: It seems to me that after the confirmation of the 80/20 or 76.4/23.6 cross in the 4hr. that the if we look for confirmation on the smaller timeframes further into the cross there is less of a chance for whipsaws. Of course this would be more of an issue with the 15m than the 1hr. So in other words, maybe if I am shooting for 20 pips, it would be wise to wait for the 15 min cross to develop futher down before entering. One more question... If the 15/30/60 timeframes are giving you a short signal and the 4hr is given you a long signal (see the 9:00gmt on the 8th of June) is that tradeable? No great discovery, but perhaps a sign that I am beginning to understand stoch and think for myself.

The most important trait is convergence of the stochastics crossing the 76.4 (80) or 23.6(20) levels with the 15/30/1H and hopefully pointed to move to the 4H. Re: June 8th. I'll post a chart soon but in the mean time; It is not a short trade I would chase since the 1H is not well timed and down quite a bit from the 15/30. The other big negative is the 4H looks like it will cross and rise above 23.6 leading to a long. The trade here is not until the long trade at 12:00 gmt and even though the 1H isn't taking off from below 23.6, I'd put the weight behind the 4H crossing the 23.6 and rising since the 15/30 have joined in too....bound to make a few pips.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Spud, Yes, the 12gmt long would have been very nice.... Take Profit near the 76.4 could have been(+/-): 20 pips/15min, 80 pips/30 &amp; 1hr. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Spud, Please look at this chart and tell me if I have incorporated all the tools to trade any of the Spud Sytem. I have the same chart for all the timeframes. Thank You.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Spud, which of your strategies do you find to be most common during the 7-midnight period (scalping, escalator, fib breakout, etc)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Spud, I've been browsing your threads trying to identify your time zone, but I just don't seem to find any clues. We'd probably need to use your timezone for mapping the previous day fibs? Would really appreciate if you could let me know.

Spud, What happened to the live trading room? Is no one participating anymore? Also have you finished your pdf boo? thanks guppy

Hi Guppy, Has gone a bit quiet in the old forum, could be down to an excellent wed(98-spread) and fri (206 pips - spread!!!). I think everyones hunkered down with their tools set up and waiting for the trades (I am!). Hope it's going well for you, todays been flatish though 2 trades a 47 and a 46 minus spread. News reckons with this break the Yen could be good for 245.6 and possible extension to 247. Later Jeff...............

PDF is still WIP but my goal is to get it wrapped before end of June. I'm not sure what is going on in the trading room.....I haven't been for a while. I don't mind showing up to answer questions...but I don't want it to turn in to a "follow the spud trade" endeavor ....but I will make time available to answer questions if people have any....but I find my best time spent is here on the forum and getting the PDF done....I think.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Take your time on the PDF and include all that confidence you share so well. I think it helps me as much as all your technical know how - Thanks!

Where did everone go?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
hi all, i've read around this thread and also spudfyre thread about "MTF escalator to pips strategy" reading this mtf fib breakout thread, I understood the system explained at post#1. Then I see that the system seems to evolve several time with additional rule. can somebody here gimme the new rule, especially entry rule. Should we use the 4H stoch and 15 stoch? if yes, what's the different with "Escalator to pips system"? please help me, and i think many other new reader of this threads. thanks

--- 帖子 #276 ---
We are in the same place - MTF Trader chatroom at http://www.tradingrooms.com/ .

--- 帖子 #277 ---
spudfyre, i've been using similar breakout methods but using it on 50 levels. so far, the stochs good at identifying potential dangers and telling me when to get out. however, there are a lot of fakeouts wehre the stoch looks like its about to hammer down, but instead its a ignorable amount of movedown before making it long. what is your rule. should i get out when stoch is breaking through the 80 level on my long position?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
so, why nobody giving me a reply? i really need help to understand this more. ok, i have read and read again, i understand that there is at least 3 system spud talking here, 1st is mtf fib breakout h1, 2nd is mtf fibbreakout H4, and also he is talking about his mtf stoch pips elevator. i'd like to ask about the mtf fib breakout for H1, i hope anybody (especially spud and pipr_prof) can give me a simple answer. 1. if the stoch break 76.4 and the price break 100, we take Long entry. is this right? 2. if the stoch break 23.6 (from below to above) and the price break 0 (from below to above), we take Long. is that right? 3. if the stoch break 76.4, and the price break 76.4, we take Long entry. is this right? 4. if the stoch cross 76.4 (from above to below), and the price cross 100 (from above to below), we take SHORT entry. is this right? 5. if the stoch cross 76.4 (from above to below), and the price cross 76.4 (from above to below, which it never touch 100), we take SHORT entry. is this right? please help me

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Is anyone still trading this method? Just curious. Looks very promising. This thread seems to have died? I wonder why? Spud, thanks for your contributions.

WOW! I like the looks of this system!! I've been backtesting it on GU and GJ all morning, looks like I would have had some GREAT results if I had found this earlier!!! Thanks! Karl

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Well, I traded using this system for the first time last night, and as expected, I had WONDERFUL results! I traded on GBPUSD and GBPJPY. I made 82 pips on GU and 67 on GJ!! I can't believe how easy this was, and how well it worked! Although I did have a feeling that it would work great based on my paper backtesting. Anyhow, thanks a million to Spud, I will keeping working on the application of this system, tailoring it to my own comfort. I would like to hear anyone else's input who have used this system, regarding trailing stops (I was using a 25 point TS last night). I think I may need to go a bit larger, but we'll see. Thanks in advance to anyone who posts. I'm interested in talking with anyone who is still using this system or a similar one. Karl

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi there, great ersults...I really like Spuds other method the Escalator to pips method but I really want to backtest it with vhands and cant figure out how yet. I cant get the indicator to work in vhands...maybe I should try this method...Joe Why did you paper trade this instead of vhands for backtesting?

I wish I could read this earlier. Will try it. Thanks.

not sure if spuds fib will work with mt4 600 + version BT, tried to load it on my mt4 today but it doesn't show in the indicators on restart

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I wasn't aware that many older posted indicators don't seem to work on mt4 600. That's a pity. I don't use MT myself so I did't know (I built this indicator on Sierra Chart). Too bad. Thanks anyway for the reply! regards BT

I re-compiled the "#SpudFibo.mq4" file with an old MT4 509 build as that usually does the trick for older codes as long as you only use the .ex4 file instead of the .mq4 file. Make sure to delete the .mq4 file from your MT4 indicator folders. I tested the "#SpudFibo.ex4" file on my MT4 670 build and it seems to be working...

Okay, up and working, thanks Aad , now to learn to use it. On with me glasses

I've looked at a few instances of using an M1 or M5 chart and found that if price penetrates YHigh or YLow, it usually continues on to the 123.6 without a big drawdown. The one exception was before 2 pm (in the illustration below, notice the reaction to round numbers 107 and 108). Has anyone else investigated this more thoroughly?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Yes, I know, 2010 was a while ago, but same observation currently.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I only found this thread last week. Been backtesting it solid and its fantastic. Forward tested from yesterday and I am 4 from 4 with over 300 pips profit. So simple. I now add the multiple Stoch to my daily system as well as a final confirmation when I am about to enter. I follow the original rules for breakout of yest high or low AND both stochs in 76 or 24 territory. I use the 50% point as my stop but it rarely reaches it. I aim for 20p or let it run if I am watching it or close it when longer term stoch (14,3,3) crosses the 50 line on the stoch. Today I picked up +20p and +165p! For me the day opens at 7am so I can be $500 up by lunch time Awesome!

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Could you share some chart images? It's great to see the thread is getting some life back.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Here is one trade I took on 19th. GBPJPY broke prev day high immediately and both stochs above 76 so i waited for 1st hour to close and then entered long using the 1/2 way point between yest high and yest low as stop. It hesitated for 2 hours and then climbed rapidly. So good that at around +165pips I got nervous and manually closed the trade.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Here's one I just entered short on.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
and 8 hrs later it hit my TP of +25pips. I did the same for AUDJPY with TP of 40 and got that as well. $650 for the day. Not bad! And both are still below the 24 stoch meaning they can still drop further. Using my usual 2 candle moving stop I would still be in both with +11p locked in so far for one and BE for the other.

Don't understand why more traders are not following this thread. It's my most consistent method. Just look through the pairs and pick the most likely to break according to Spud's rules. Not going to explain; Spud and others have already done so. Today was another great day for this method. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
You'll always find these trades. Can't understand why not many followed Spud's suggestion:

Here's SpudFibo Dashboard Now we know exactly where are all the prices. In the following picture, we can see that GBP is strong. Most of them broke out of yesterday high. If the prices are above yesterday high, then the "Fibo 100%" column will be dark green. Now if the prices are below yesterday low, then the "Current price" column will be dark red.

Good morning, Spud. Please could you tell me how you would have interpreted the following situation based on M30 and H1, where the Stochastics pulled away from each other? Otherwise, I have to thank you for an excellent and plain method that one can trade without blinking an eye. Continued success to you. Hercs. Incidentally, the reason for the M30 is that I personally think it is "more reliable" than the H1 for early retraces, etc.
