Well here goes.

This is a strategy that I use with great success, but before we go any further I'd just like to say...

THIS IS NOT THE HOLY GRAIL!!!

It DOES NOT exist and never will. All you can do is to find something that gives you the edge.

Right, that's that over with so lets move on.

In this first post I'll get the chart set up and hopefully later today post the entry exit rules etc etc.

Attached is a MACD, upload to a chart along with:-

50 EMA applied to HIGH

50 EMA applied to LOW

15 EMA applied to CLOSE.

Change the MACD parameters to read 35,70,1,12

It should now look something like this.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
done, waiting for the entry exit rules

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I'll demo you're idea for a bit and see what happens.  Awaiting instructions.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Ok, I'll try and explain this in as easy a way as I can.

The currency pairs that I personally use are:-

GBP/USD

EUR/USD

GBP/JPY

USD/CHF

Trading these 4 pairings has averaged approx 180 pips per week.

I do not know about other pairings performance.

I usually only look for trade setups between the hours of 0600 to 1800 GMT

So, the theory is that entries are made off the 15 EMA.

RULE 1. The MACD has to be the right colour for the direction of the trade and the MACD MA must be within the coloured area. (See image below)

RULE 2. When the price hits the 15 EMA & bounces off or goes through the 15 EMA and reverses back it's a trade AS LONG AS:-

The high/low of the setup candle is NOT more than 50 pips away from the 15 EMA (30 for G/J & U/C) AND the 15 EMA is not within the 50 EMA channel. (See image below)

Entry is then 10 pips above/below the high/low of the setup candle. (Add spread for long trades)

Stoploss 100 pips

Takeprofit 100 pips

Go to breakeven when +50

If pending order is not activated and price goes the other way and closes above/below 15 EMA -- Cancel order and wait for next setup.

RULE 3. DO NOT TRADE WHEN THE 15 EMA IS INSIDE OR VERY CLOSE TO THE 50 EMA CHANNELS.

Hope this makes sense. Feel free to ask questions.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I'll try and post setups as I see them through the day.

Here's one for the EUR/USD.

1000 GMT

High 1.3721

Entry 1.3731

+50 pips @ 1500 GMT Move stop to B/E

Trade currently +17

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Here's another one.

USD/CHF

1100 GMT

Low 0.9363

Enter 0.9353

Currently +20 pips

--- 帖子 #7 ---
sorry, but i can not see any chart

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yeah, I'm not seeing any either.  Thought at first it was probably my computer, but now that other people are having the problem.............

--- 帖子 #9 ---
They seem to be showing ok on mine.

Here's attachments instead.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Unable to see the original charts either

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Apologies,

Have just got my head round posting charts here.

Right, my previous post has all the charts.

For post # 1 refer to my previous post chart 5

For post # 4 refer to my previous post charts 4 & 3

For EUR/USD setup refer to previous post chart 1

For USD/CHF setup refer to previous post chart 2

Hope that makes sense

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi, thanks for sharing this with others. May I ask, how long have you averaged 180 pips per week? Do you trade this on a live account? Thankyou

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Have been monitoring for ages and live since Nov 10.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks, I like the look of this.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
The beauty of this strategy is that when the market is moving in a sideways movement you'll find that the 15 EMA is too close to or within the 50 EMA channel which will then keep you out of a trade.

And when the market is trending, well, happy days.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Looks good. Going back looking at the recent charts there are a stack of entries where this would work, and in some cases work quite well.

Ill keep following.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Yes, that's what I thought, it's the choppy times that are the killer with trend continuation methods, looking forward to getting this set-up.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
A quick look at the charts is looking good for some potential setups for the morning. All 4 pairings are taking shape.

I must admit though, if I have a trade on, I don't tend to put another one on the same currency pairing until the first one has gone to +50 and is then at B/E.

So as we speak, if another setup occurs on the EUR/USD then I'll put it on. But if a setup occurs on USD/CHF then I'll wait until todays trade gets to +50 and hence B/E.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
System sounds good I think I will follow this one

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Forexgold,

As the title of your post says "Nice & simple" ----- Just the way I like it.

Have tried strategies where the whole screen is cluttered with indicators - didn't work for me.

With this strategy screentime is minimal and it's so simple..

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This sure looks like the commercial system called the "Black Dog" system, right down to the creators colour scheme for the template (except the colour of the 50's channel).

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Commercial or not if it works we should be happy

Ronnie what kind of percentage wins you been having with this system? Also

How many trade say per week do you average?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Black Dog, Red Cat, Green Tiger, Orange Baboon.........

Call it what you want.

A friend passed on the MACD to me last year and the rest of the indicators are standard Metatrader4.

Bottom line is..... The strategy works.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Probably about 5 - 6 setups per week approx.

As for % wins - In the last 3 months it's approx 35 wins, 12 losses and about 12 B/E.

I must add, that out of the winners about 75% of them would've gone on to make 150 pips............ Me personally, I'm happy to take 100.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Sounds good...

Do you avoid trading round news??

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I don't trade NFP day, that's about it.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
USD/CHF trade just about getting to +50...... Move to B/E imminent (Hopefully)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thought stop was 100? B/E at 50?......edit: got it you mean entry, must sleep now.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Ronnie, How do you change to different colors on Histogram.  Mine are all same color.  Shorter, longer above "0", below "0".

This looks like it will be a good system.  Thanks for posting.  Paul

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Looks like a good idea.

Ive tried playing with the EMA bounce but cudnt fine a way to filter false bounce. This might be it.

Just can someone get me work on the Histogram color?

And can u explain about rule number 2. Im getting confused.

When a candle touch the 15 EMA and bounce, at the same time it mus not be more 50 pips away than both the 50 EMA?

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
just LOL at this one.

You rox.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
yeah, i second that!

as long it can catch PIPs, it's a good cat/good baboon/good dog or good boy!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi ronnierott,

I realise there's 2 color tones to your MACD histogram, in your 1st post. A lighter red and a darker red. Are there any significance to these 2 colors?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Dark red = falling, light red = rising

dark green = falling, light green = rising

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi ronnierott,

sorry to throw u so many questions.

how do u define a setup candle? i have drawn 4 orange boxes in e chart attached. are these e setup candles?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
thanks for e reply. appreciate your respond.

other than e falling and rising, it doesnt play a part in e rules, is my understanding correct?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
no part in the rules, just good for visualising if the MACD is falling or rising

--- 帖子 #38 ---
i see. thank u very much for your input.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
GBPUSD setting up in the next hour (hopefully)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Here's a screenshot of the parameter box for the MACD.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Personally for me, keeping in mind all other rules in this thread, the Buy setup candle is the one that pierces down through the 15EMA but closes above the 15EMA (I'm still debating whether or not if this candle should also close above it's open, hence forming an 'up' candle, it is price action we're looking at though)

- OR -

The Buy setup candle opens below the 15EMA but then closes above the 15EMA.

Vice-versa for Sell setup candle.

The candles that just 'touch' the 15EMA have to be treated with common-sense.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
i see. thank u! this is indeed helpful.

10 more mins to sterling pair setup candle close.

and it coincides with 0600gmt time.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Looks to be forming a hammer candle formation...

I'll be in it after this candle closes as per rules... err may be not LOL!

My fingers are twitching!!!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
nope, i have not execute e trade. it drops further and macd turns dark green.

am i exercising flexibility or breaking e rules? hmmm.....

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I think with this behaviour we are see right now, the setup candle would open below 15ema and close above 15ema.  Waiting game.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
im watching as well. we'll see.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
yup, lets see.

have u taken a look at EURUSD? does that look like a setup candle to u?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
yes it does.

now what shud we wait for. just asking. since im still dont get the entry rules.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
This time I'm not gonna guess LOL! Let's wait till it closes.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
yup, now H1 candle is not merely touching e 15ema.

it pierced thru and in this hour, if EURUSD closes above 1.376, this is a valid setup candle. correct?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
If during the 1 HR candle it touches the 15 EMA and then closes above/below, depending on whether buy/sell and the distance from the 15EMA to the low/high of candle is less than 50 pips (30 for G/J & U/C) then put in a buystop or sellstop order 10 pips above/ below the candle.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
The setup candle is the one that touched the 15 EMA

Dark/light green or red has no relevance.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
If EUR/USD candle CLOSES above 15 EMA then buystop order will be put in 10 pips above this candle.

If next candle carries on heading down and closes below 15EMA - cancel pending order and wait for next setup.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
thank u!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
got it! this is very clear rule. is this rule built to prevent false-breakout?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Yes,

By the looks of it the candle is going to close below 15EMA, so we then have to wait for the price to reverse back and close above again........... As long as the MACD is still good and the high isn't more than 50 pips from the 15EMA we'll be good to put in buystop order 10 pips above it

--- 帖子 #57 ---
If i get you right, 1 hr TF is for set-up and we enter on 15min TF?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
No,

All is on 1 Hour TF

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi ronnierott,

Attached chart, USDCHF could be on our radar for now? if e candle remains this way, i'll put a sell order 10 PIPs below the close of e possible setup candle. is this correct?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Correct,

It's the only potential setup at the mo

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks for the prompt response. It seems there is a trade from yesterday thats yet to hit target..everything's pointing up today: your system, the daily candle, 4hr candle...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
TP reaching soon.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
You're right!! the trade followed all the rules for entry. Set-up candle not more than 30pips for the pair. It's going to hit TP for sure.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Sorry,

Just re read your post.

Entry would be 10 pips below the LOW of candle not close

--- 帖子 #65 ---
well, i wouldnt say that. until e final whistle is blown for 100 PIPs to drop into your pocket, there is always a possibility that e market may turn against u.

its totally alike betting soccer. coming into the 89th min, e losing team which is down by 3 goals, can draw the game by conceding 3 goals in a matter of minutes. *sweat*!

just remember to put your SL into BE once you are +50 in PIPs

--- 帖子 #66 ---
oh, low of e candle. thanks for pointing that out, appreciate that!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Just doing some manual backtesting, why use 100pip SL because this seems to be a breakout system. If it's going to happen,it happens. Does not beat about the bush..

--- 帖子 #68 ---
USD/CHF ---- No trade.

Low of candle too far away from 15 EMA

--- 帖子 #69 ---
thanks for the clarification

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Bad news!!! I was going to pull the trigger!!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hard question to answer.

Obviously a SL has to be put in place somewhere & my minimum risk/reward is always 1:1.

Other SL levels could always be backtested I guess

--- 帖子 #72 ---
yup, more than 30 PIPs.

order cancelled, thanks for pointing it out and good guidance.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yes, TP would've been hit

--- 帖子 #74 ---
angelofx, i hope you're on demo acct, since you're new to this system.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
yup, PIPs will be stored in e pocket of whoever using this system.

warm warm inside e pocket

did u see this pair coming and traded it?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Yes i am on demo..I'm suggesting a counter trade since the method is not giving us the green light.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
what's ur definition of a counter-trade?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I like it, nice job

Will test it and see how it goes...

One question though, should we wait for the candle to close or can we open a trade on the current candle?

Also the TP and SL of 100 pips can be improved, this system should be a very high risk to reward ratio system.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
USD/CHF buy

--- 帖子 #80 ---
well well, we have missed out EURGBP! She's complaining, but is she giving another chance?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
u have your point there.

however, i wouldnt do that, because this system works on e extension of e trend, not retracement. even if it's a 86.4% fib retracement, users of this system will not reap its benefit.

therefore the beauty of this system is that, u'll encounter less whipsaw. if u really hit 100 SL, it means the bigger trend may be taking a turn.

ronnierott, would u comment on my understanding of your system?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Missed it.

But then again I do tend to only look for setups between 0600 and 1800 GMT

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Wait for the close

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I'd score you 90/100. To add to your point, you dont often get signals with profitable systems, thats why majority lose money in forex. Someone who trades this system would have gone back to bed(est) or go find something else to do rather than conjuring fake signals.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Basically I follow my rules as stated.

Yes, in a trending market it's ideal and when it's sideways I like to think that the 15EMA will be close to or within the 50EMA channel.... Hence keeping me out of a trade.

I only trade the 4 pairings I listed, reason being, they move.

Saw a EUR/GBP chart posted up earlier.  Me personally will not trade that pairing.  For that pairing to move 100 pips in a relatively short time is a major feat.

Bottom line is.....COMFORT ZONE.

Everybody's comfort zone is different........

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Any 1 in on the USD/CHF on the 7am candle.

The signal after Ronnies second trade on this thread

--- 帖子 #87 ---
What about this setup?

What shud i wait for?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
For me the candles low was too far away from the 15EMA, so I gave it a miss.

15EMA was at 0.9305

LOW of candle  0.9266

39 pips diff..... (30 max for this pair)... No Trade

Yesterdays USD/CHF just hit TP

--- 帖子 #89 ---
yup, i'll think it's valid. wick of e long bullish candle stands at 1.3766. i'll place a buy order at 1.3776. Once 1.3776 is hit, my Long order will be executed.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
For me it would be a no.

Reason being............. I prefer to see the MA on the MACD in the coloured area a bit more than what it is.

Again, it's all about comfort zone.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
do u mean the area which i circled black in e chart? it's too close to the MACD parameter?   .

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Yes, that's the area.

I do prefer to see it further in to the coloured area... like it is on the chart 8 hours ago.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Something so simple should be made a EA right? I dont have the time, but got the theory in my head.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Fill your boots... I say.

Any feedback that could improve this strategy is most welcome.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
5 STAR RATING ALREADY.

I'm impressed................ Thank you

--- 帖子 #96 ---
From a visual backtest over the last 2 weeks it looks good. I wont get a chance to EA this until maybe tomorrow night. But I should be able too

Great Thread so far!

Ok just need to firm up some of these rules and then we can rock and roll. I have a hr now, so I might see what I can do.

RULE 1. The MACD has to be  the right colour for the direction of the trade and the MACD MA must be  within the coloured area. (See image below) - Check

RULE 2. When the price hits the 15 EMA & bounces off or goes through the 15 EMA and reverses back it's a trade AS LONG AS:- - @ the last candle? or the current candle?

The high/low of the setup candle is NOT more than 50 pips away from the 15 EMA (30 for G/J & U/C) AND the 15 EMA is not within the 50 EMA channel. (See image below) - check

Entry is then 10 pips above/below the high/low of the setup candle.

Stoploss 100 pips

Takeprofit 100 pips

Go to breakeven when +50

If pending order is not activated and price goes the other way and  closes above/below 15 EMA -- Cancel order and wait for next setup.

RULE 3. DO NOT TRADE WHEN THE 15 EMA IS INSIDE OR VERY CLOSE TO THE 50 EMA CHANNELS. - Define VERY CLOSE?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
That's great, would be great too if the EA had an alert email and audio for manual traders too ....

--- 帖子 #98 ---
OK I have made a beta indicator for the three moving averages.  The 15MA is the signal MA with three colors for long,short or no trade.

There are some problems still left, there are gaps when the color changes not sure how to fix this.

Anyone here who is an indicator expert please fix the indicator.

This indi will only make your life easier it will not improve the system obviously, and is good for visual backtesting.

Enjoy

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Here we go again with the EA

--- 帖子 #100 ---
The logic is solid, so a EA should also be solid.

Great Indicator btw!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Not yet great needs to be fixed first

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Page 1, post 6: you took that USDCHF trade when the MACD EMA was in the same area (close to the MACD). What was the difference (comfort) between that trade and this one?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
The USD/CHF trade yesterday was fractionally better than todays EUR/USD setup (Not by much at all though).............. In my opinion

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Could you be a bit clearer... For example, would you say it was fractionally better because that USDCHF trade did not pierce through the channel before setting up?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks for publishing, I love the simplicity and looking back it works a treat. I look forward to using it.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Both charts attached. You're probably right, but then we get into the realms of price action.

EUR/USD is abit more ugly than the USD/CHF though

--- 帖子 #107 ---
EU setting up, close to the edge though, may reduce stake

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Rule 2............. The candle that touches is the setup candle. Wait for it to close before checking the criteria ie, distance from 15 EMA etc

Rule 3............. Define very close?? I do it visually, but after going back over the charts then I would say that the 15 EMA needs to be away from the relevant 50 EMA by about 6 pips.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #109 ---
yup, MACD doesnt look nice, according to ronnierott

--- 帖子 #110 ---
EU order long set at 13790

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Looks better now that the candle has closed.

Buystop 1.3793

--- 帖子 #112 ---
yup, my order for Long is set at 1.3791

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Just remember that if order doesn't get triggered and a candle CLOSES below 15 EMA........... Cancel order and wait for next setup.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
what if we get the next candle above 15EMA but order not triggered within that 1 hr candle, do we still cancel order?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
got it! thanks for e reminder

--- 帖子 #116 ---
No.

Leave order until either:-

a) Order gets triggered

OR

b) Candle CLOSES below 15 EMA

So screen time is basically a quick look on the hour

--- 帖子 #117 ---
cool ,thanks

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Ronnierott, lets say this is EURUSD, will u execute a sell stop @112.45?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I believe so all the rules are met!!

The candle after has closedd below the 15 ema...

My only doubt is the 15 ema is near trhe channel!!

Correct me if I am wrong

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I would be careful selling into 112.45 - look to the left, this was the start of a strong demand bar. The cycle has now completed and if at all I might look for buy scenarios.

However, the eurjpy is trying to catch up with a strong eurusd - this proves difficult, as we have a strong Yen in times of crisis ( Libyia etc. ).

Wait and see is sometimes a position.

Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
yup, you're right. however, taking a look back into e rules of this system, in order to even think of a 'buy', the macd have to be green. it's still in a red zone, at least e fastest is 6 more hours to go. unless u bend e rules, ie.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
UC back through the 15EMA, possible set up in 15 mins

--- 帖子 #123 ---
u mean swissy, not loonie, right?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
yeh

--- 帖子 #125 ---
UC short order at 9252

--- 帖子 #126 ---
price now is 0.9272

your sell-stop around 0.9238. that's around 30 PIPs of waiting time to execute e trade.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
bending e rules to have an early entry?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
EUR/JPY isn't a pairing I would normally trade................... But the setup looks good.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
USD/CHF looks like a sellstop at 0.9238.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Is your computer missing the "th" keys?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
here u go.

TH

it makes typing a whole lot faster. don't u take notes in school, with 'e', instead of 'the'?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well guys & girls, since posting up the strategy less than 24 hours ago, I cannot believe the positive feedback that has been posted on this thread, and it is very much appreciated.............. Long may it continue.

I'd like to think that anything constructive relating to this method of trading would also be posted on the thread.

If people do have the time to try and improve the strategy then that'll be great for everyone. Examples being:- Would trailing stops work better than fixed TP etc etc.

Personally I'm overwhelmed with the positive feedback that everybody is offering and hopefully we will all benefit from it.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I thought that as well          :-)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Well, at depends, on wheer I want to be able to read e notes at I take . Just kidding....

--- 帖子 #135 ---
thank you ronnierott for sharing this wonderful strategy with us. lets share our understanding and comments and ultimately, we're all here for a purpose. to make PIPs. Cheers!

oh ya, and make frens too!

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Thank you from me too and my best wishes to all here...

Hi Ron,

have you tried this method with XAU/USD pair? Coz the situation right now really boost the safe haven's price up, I'd like to try it but just wanna ask your opinion first...

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Funny you should say that, it was only the other day that i put gold on the chart to see how it performed.

Haven't had chance yet to go over it but hopefully will this weekend....... Along with oil also.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
GJ setting up, any takers?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Ok working on the EA now, got most of it functional. Just some testing. on EUR/USD. Its definently profitable for longs (last 2 years)

Just need to add the filter for the within 15/50 ema check.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
GJ: I'm in sell stop 131.944

EDIT: I will be cancelling this sell stop if the next candle closes above the 15ema

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Nice one Triptizine.

Could this be the icing on the cake......

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Still working on it.. Longs only result below (since 1st Jan)

--- 帖子 #146 ---
i like manual trading.

Either way, this system rocks.

May god bless u with much pips and a healthy life.

after all, too much money without health is nothing.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
orange babboon roxks!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Yes orange baboon definitely rocks.

Thanks to ronnierott for posting this method.

ronnierott, it would honour me if you used this image as your avatar

--- 帖子 #149 ---
sig_buy=iMACD(NULL,0,35,70,1,PRICE_CLOSE,MODE_MAIN,1);

sig_sell=iMA(NULL,0,15,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_CLOSE,1);

sig_high=iMA(NULL,0,50,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_HIGH,1);

sig_low=iMA(NULL,0,50,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_LOW,1);

a250ma0=iClose(NULL,0,1);

gappers1=iLow(NULL,0,1);

gapsum=iHigh(NULL,0,1);

a250ma4=iOpen(NULL,0,1);

a250ma1=(sig_sell>gappers1);

a100ma4=(sig_sell<gapsum);

a100ma3=(a250ma0>sig_sell);

macrationow=(sig_sell>sig_low);

macratioprev=(sig_sell<sig_high);

sig_sellnow=(macratioprev+macrationow);

sig_buynow=(sig_buy>0);

Logic:

if ((sig_buy>0) && ((a250ma1+a100ma4)>1) && ((macratioprev+macrationow<2))){

So for long:

If MACD > 0

If the last bar 15EMA is greater then the Low

If the last bar 15EMA is less then the high The touch/split

If the last bar close is not within the 50 EMA's

Then enter...

Now i need to work on the +10pip entry, and the 50pip check.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
triptizine, your 101% dedication towards e thread, is out of e world. i cannot do anything, but to give u my 2 thumbs up for your effort!!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Shine on you crazy diamond.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thanks buddy. More interested in the theory. Its got merit. The EA (will) trade, but I wouldnt recommend it.

Its more for a manual notification system. It still needs a lot work.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
yeah, i only trust manual. since you're doing e programming, can u be as kind to allow e 100 PIPs SL to be a variable? cos i feel adjusting e 100 PIPs SL to maybe 50. but i don't know how to program. Once your EA is out, i can amend 100 to 50 and start e testing.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
List of functions in EA at the moment:

extern double  Lots = 10;

extern int  StopLoss = 0;

extern int   TakeProfit = 0;

extern bool  TradeAtCloseBar = false;

extern int   TrailingStop = 0;

extern int   TrailingStep = 0;      //Trailing step

extern int     BreakEven = 0;

extern int    MagicNumber=34;

//For alerts:

extern int     Repeat=3;

extern int     Periods=5;

extern bool    UseAlert=false;

extern bool    SendEmail=true;

Got you covered. 100 PIPS is way to much i feel.

I have converted another EA into this one, so its got features we wont use, its dirty, not overally clean, but functional. lol.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Would any one think this system would work on longer time frames, particularly on D1. If so, any suggestions for adjustment to the H1 rules?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Ok, so here is the ea, its very early days for the ea mind you. It will trade. Be mindful of this.

Basic conditions at the moment:

Lot size is locked - AccountFreeMargin()*1/1000)/10

These all work:

Stop Loss

TakeProfit

TrailingStop

TrailingStep

BreakEven

All work, if you have a 5 digit broker it needs to be 1000 for 100pips.

No guarantees on my behalf. This was just to take a look at the theory and see if I can EA it. I am still learning, and this code has been modified from another EA. Thanks to the original peeps who coded this.

Its a starting point:

Basically the conditions for a order (at the moment are)

Long:

MACD > 0

Last Bar Low lower then 15ema

Last Bar High higher then 15ema

15ema not within 50EMA low or High.

I have not completed the +10 Pip Rule or the review of how far the 15EMA is from the 50EMA yet.

Short is the reverse..

IT IS SET TO CLOSE A TRADE IF A REVERSE CONDITION ARISES.

IE: YOUR LONG, AND A SHORT CONDITION ARISES, IT WILL CLOSE THE LONG AND OPEN A NEW SHORT.

--------------

Now onto the topic of dailys. I have seen a interesting pattern in back testing this.

A few options:
Look for the trend in MACD, as this is determining which direction (long or short) - Maybe 2nd last bar v's Last Bar and determine direction!? Actually reverse this logic, and do not trade unless the Last bar HIGH/LOW is above from the 15ema (higher for long) I have posted the ea to get people to think. See how you go.

It is profitable under certain conditions, it appears money management, stop loss, and trailings are the keys. But it does pick a good trend.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Nice one............. Cheers

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Can't see a problem with longer timeframes, but obviously SL, TP and low/high of candle from 15 EMA would have to be re-evaluated.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
many thanks!! what kind of test have u done so far, if any?

My setup candle seems to be the one before yours.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
A few, just to make sure its valid, you will notice, all the testing text on the left, thats validating the figures are right.

Ill work on the +10pip and 50EMA Spread tonight.

I need some values to work with, so I assume the OP meant, if the entry current price is:

1.38665

He wants the entry to be 1.38765? If he was shorting? or 1.38565 if going long?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes , I missed it ....lol

so are you short now, seems valid ?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
yup, thats e 1 i'm seeing @ 1610. not ronnierott's, cos i only managed to see e setup candle, half an hour ago.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
if Short: if current price of setup candle's shadow is 1.3876. the entry will be 1.3866

if Long: if current price of setup candle's wickis 1.3876. the entry will be 1.3886

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Ok, so thats not going to work with a EA, as I cant place a order to buy, above the current ask. If that makes sense.

Ill take a look.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Chaps, Just a a suggesttion, but how about a Ronnierott EA discussion thread? keep this one clean and focused on the strategy?  Other threads do this also......

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Alert: setup candle forming in loonie.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Somewhat agree, but being quite a simple strategy, a EA would at least give guidance, no point creating a thread when the strategy hasnt been completely proven yet..

I guess if it all works out, then yup a EA thread would be good.

what a great system...!!

when i read this thread on the beginning i realize its a lot similar to my system with only lil bit different setting. on my system i use 30minutes on Gbp/Usd.

indicator:

EMA 34 high,low and close

EMA 14

CCI 50

6-20 GMT

when price touch 14 EMA i will buy/sell with cci must above +100/below -100

SL below/above 34EMA channel TP 20-25pip.

I feel ronnierott system very usefull for my system especialy the MACDwith MA indicator.

Well Done Ronnierott...!!

this is my chart look like.... the orange arrow are the buy directly when price hit 14EMA and cci more than +100.still need more improvement.

The only thing is i have to wait the price hit the 14 EMA,and thats boring.maybe i need some audio visual alert so i dont have to baby sit the PC monitor,but im not a coder i wonder if any coder would make the audio visual indicator for me.

what do you think guys??please comment....

Hi Ronnie

The more I study this system the more I like it

Well done Ronnie

This system is very easy to see at a glance if we have a viable trade aswell

rather than having to study it

Have you tried othe timeframes cos I have been down to 15m and the rule still applies except of course SL TP ETC

so it cold become a good all rounder , depending on how the trader feels

Wether he want to check and trade every 15m or whatever

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi Pete,

For those lucky enough to be able to monitor more closely, this strategy works well on the M15 timeframe.

Here's my settings that I use when I'm able to trade M15:-

SL & TP - 20 pips

Max distance of high/low from 15 EMA - 12 pips

Enter 3 pips above/below the high/low of candle

(Don't forget to add spread to buy orders)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Excellent , just read the whole thread

Looks like it is gonna be my new puppy

One thing , saw an indicator flying about RonnieRot system indi

We could adjust that to set an alert also when it touches the 15EMA for the first time after (so many bars of so and so of not touching) to alert the user on a potential trade

Have not really had time to look at EA but can imagine that functionality is already within

Why do I always seem to find great threads on Friday afternoons

and not Sunday nights

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I have been playing with the EA, i have some pretty decent data here and its not overally profitable.

Unless I am missing a key point of reference, here are my observations.

Its missing the key trend a lot of the time, you see the trend go long, but the intial move (where the high and low are over the 15ema) is usually when the 15 ema is in the 50EMA High / Low.

Based on the rules thats not a trade.

Continuing on, you see the trend, usually in teh range of 100pips or so. Sometimes quite a lot higher. But then it will reverse, and thats where you get caught out with a EA, as it whipsaws and then goes south.

While I do not doubt as a manual system it will be ok. As a EA its going to need a few more filters I believe. The other issue is Stops and TP. Finding a sweet spot seems to be hard work.

----------

Side Note:

Same Rules except

15 EMA

30 EMA High and Low instead of 50,

EUR/USD

Would have turned 10k into 24k from Jan 2007 to Today.

62% Long Winners

58% Short Winners

100pip Stop Loss

50pip Trailing Stop

5pip Trailing Step

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yeh as in any system I think you still have to think of SR levels and reversals , which are nigh on impossible to filter, its at the discrection of the Trader for exits which is the case for alot of the EA not functioning aswell as the manual method, I tend to use them more for just the entries

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Please someone change my these single colored moving average indicators,both of them , to a color changing one so that they should change the color according to the trend. Thanks in advance .

--- 帖子 #185 ---
thanks for e info. i cant say how much i'm grateful for e piece of stats above. do u mean, e parameter u used, is 30ema instead of 50ema?

if 50ema is used, what's will e result be?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
50ema, cleaned the account out. 30ema was profitable. 50ema was under 50% winners.

I am also getting a lot better results going long only.. FYI.

I agree with peterporter, getting in is fine, getting out (or not getting in when its about to turn) is the key here. You can see it in Visual EA mode. I dont want to cram the thread, but the EA is a good way of testing a method (in the past) so just attempting to add some value to the thread, would love to see other outcomes!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
i see. i'm testing out e original 50ema channel and 15ema on a 15M TF, EURUSD pair. manual backtesting, ie.

Initial result from 16th feb to 23rd feb 2011 (during 0600gmt to 1800gmt), yield 5 winners and 2 losers, out of 7 trades. this is based on 20 pips TP and SL.

i'm v curious what's e outcome if i use 30ema.

give me an hour, i should have e result posted in e thread.

here's e result of testing out e 30ema channel and 15ema on a 15M TF, EURUSD pair. manual backtesting, ie.

Initial result from 16th feb to 23rd feb 2011 (during 0600gmt to 1800gmt), yield 4 winners and 2 losers, out of 6 trades. this is based on 20 pips TP and SL.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
looks like result varies. maybe my sample size is too small.

i'll still stick to e original 50ema, i suppose.

but i like 15m TF for this system.

1. this way, i can take advt of e burst of PIPs and momentum (no trade half an hour before/after impact-news)

2. all pairs can be covered. think of it this way, number of 100 PIPs move per day EUR/USD can cover vs number of 100 PIPs move per day EUR/GBP can cover. not just GBP/USD, EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/CHF. However, having said this, since SL and TP is tight, only those pairs which has small spread, can be taken into consideration. eg, EURUSD

Feedback/comments are welcomed.

Great stricky,

I really love the basic idea of this thread, I notice that many seem to be interested in creating an EA.....

Well, this is nothing for me, but good luck.

As far as I am concerned, a modest and risk free 80 - 100 pips per week is all I need. I will post setups next week once I see them.

Once again thank you ronnierott, may the force be with you !

Have a good weekend.

( edit : below example usdchf 1hr, I have added a 55 ema for 4hr, 55 ema daily TF, and Lawgirl`s Trenddisplay for momentum;  market price for easy visuals. )

--- 帖子 #200 ---
kedridder,

Normally I hate it if in a new thread people start modifying the original template immediately, but this is just what I thought might keep it simple and enable me to switch to 15min or 4h without 1000 new lines and indicators having to readjust.

Lawgirl`s Trenddisplay has just proven to be a great momentum indicator - we all know that sometimes we have classic candlestick or price action formations like engulfing bars, pinbars, hammers etc., expect a follow through,.... only seeing that there is less strength behind the move than we thought.

So to have added confidence that our candlestick setups ( according to ronnie´s recommendations of course ) work, I thought about only taking low-risk setups when at least 3 RSI ( 1h, 4h, Daily ) all agree at once.

I can post on Monday or provide a template, otherwise PM me.

I do want to stress however that this is Ronnie`s great idea and we shouldn`t focus on the holy grail mix of indicators as he says, but instead give all of this some time to settle and prove for ourselves if the method fits to our personality and mindset ( patience, discipline, number of pips expected at what risk level etc. ).

Hope that helps, see you all on Monday.

You too ronnie, thank you !

The great thing about the 1h is that the whole world is seeing the same candles and charts,... and everyone can then decide if they want to switch to 15min or higher timeframes.

I am very much low risk......

BTW : usdcad @ almost never before seen lows. It is NOT the time of day I want to trade, just pointing to the really extraordinary lows in usdcad, usdchf and usdjpy.

Here is a thread that was the origin of the "Black Dog" that I believe then evolved into the current commercial system. Some of you smarties may be able to glean an insight or two.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Thank you fxhermit, very interesting. Actually I bought the commercial system about 2 years ago. However, although the system was somehow safe and low-risk, I had late entries. I was too focused on the arrows and then noticed that I had better entries if I follow price action and keep mindful of stop-hunt levels. But to each his/her own.

BTW : do you know if Bluemental is still present somewhere ? I enjoyed your posts at the BigMac thread very much - your knowledge about Pitchforks, Swing trading and combining multiple timeframes was very helpful and educational.

how can it be??

--- 帖子 #212 ---
OK I've been thinking about possible improvements - discussions of which have been welcomed by the thread starter - I feel that the MM/Trade Management of this system could be improved upon to enhance profitability.

I have taken an un-scientific look back at a few charts this w'end, my suggestions for discussion would include the following:

1) a 50-60 pip SL and

2) tiered TP levels

2.1) 25% TP at 50 pips and move stop to BE/Entry

2.2) 25% TP at 75 pips

2.3) 25% TP at 100 pips

2.4) 25% TP at full candle close above or below 15EMA, in the opposite direction

Maybe something to think about

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Good thinking Stricky, perhaps the S/L and TP's could be made dynamic in nature so that market range is taken into consideration. TEB63 has an absolutely great thread on this at:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=106165

Would suit this strategy quite well, I think.

Since a picture is worth a thousand words, here is a recent EURUSD example of what I am refering to in the above post.

Let's include the obvious add on entry (isn't hindsight just wonderful ). I'm such a darn lazy trader and this approach is almost a no brainer, that's why I like it. Besides, simple always works best.

Yes, price always comes first, after all it's the beast us fleas are attempting to ride. However, as fleas we have the ability of being nimble and thereby hopefully taking advantage of the lumbering beast . O.K. so much for the silly analogy.

Yeah, the BIGMAC thread kind of died out, regardless, the basic principles apply to any trading approach. Glad you enjoyed it while it lasted.

Hi Stricky,

Liking the sound of your suggestions.

The number of times I've seen a trade go 80+ then finish BE, it's criminal not to reap some of the benefits.

Automating this MM would be even better.

Having unlimited screentime would also help........... Pity the day job sometimes gets in the way, damn work.

I'm liking the way this thread is going.

Thanks fxhermit, I'll take a look at that thread

Yeh' I'd noticed this too

--- 帖子 #221 ---
it is interesting how there is a great fascination from noobs about colourly indis

which are just calculating historical data to tell them the future

it can calculate now feelings but it cannot tell anyone where its gonna go

it just tells the strenght of teh movement from past to the present

other aspects we might consider is the weighted demand and supply aspect of how fast the direction might turn

ema's might tell us that the presents market sentiment is lower than the past's

so it might mean that it would be harder to get back on its feet and move the other direction

because for a flow of river to be changed,there has be a leak in the ground,giving that leak a new direction to flow into,thus lesser flow into the previous direction

for that,its much more useful to predict where the riverflow will go if we find cracks and tunnels ,not just look at the flow of river

like the trend might be lower than the past as supply overcomes demand,but things might be changing and we might start to see absorbing volume

the demanders can absorb offers given,the market shoots up

if u trade live ,ur emotions can run in,and try to wait for the market to come back,but it might come back a bit,and then shoot up again

but our physchology canot manage all of that streess,and the follower of the macd will be looking at the history

how is the macd gonna tell us that?

it cant because its just telling us the techinical point ,the market has many participants which make it move,on their beliefs and their interests,

they all have different directions

relying on historical data cannot bring much fortune

but they can help greatly ,if u can spot the participants digging their tunnels through the small cracks wanting the river to flow into their fields

and how conservatively they will manage that water,we can can predict how much water will be left flowing in the river direction

Thanks for the high quality posts - I love TEB´s threads. And if we apply some common sense 1-2-3 basic patterns  ( with SL and TP targets ) as described so well by TEB, NiceGuy and Paulus - I think we might have a better chance to avoid some unnecessary trades.

Hi Everyone

I took this trade on Friday night (just for testing entry) and Its the best there was at the time and luckiliy it broke through

PLEASE NOTE MY ENTRY IS ONE CANDLE TO LATE . should be close of the  5th candle back not 4th but that doesnt matter for now

I have a question,

When the entry trigger is so close to support , (which often seems to be the case) would you set your -10pips from the Low a bit more, so it is on the other side of the Support Level (like i did here) or just ignore the trade , It just seems a shame when you have a nice set up to dismiss it all the time

Thanks

I can only recommend what Jim of james16 and jarroo ( as senior there ) always say in this instance.

If you have a setup candle right above a support level, big round number etc. - it is critical to know about your choices.

a) you can enter very close below the close of the candle and take your stop to breakeven the moment it hits the support.

b) wait for an entry below the support level/round number

c) wait for a retest of the level from below, then take the trade if it looks obvious that support now acts as resistance.

For me personally I wouldn`t have traded it

a) no 100 % clear previous swing move

b) very unusual lows, even on daily chart

c) time of day, only NY open, sudden price spikes possible.

But good that it worked out, you had courage and luck on your side !

Just my 2 cents, hope it helps.

May I suggest to make the TP variable based on say 1 * ATR(30hours); for each pair this will be different and more realistic than just using 100 pips across the board.

Hi Ronnie

The only Current EA I know of that does up to three (not four ) levels of percentage TP like this is the THV Cave Manager , are there any other ones out there for percentage to min four levels ??

I personally use Steve's MPTM for management to breakeven and partial closure, Its good for me until that point

After that I am on my own so to speak for the rest of the trades TP's

PS Also noticed that the Cave Mager can set TP percentages at Fib and daily Pivot levels but when I used it last I remeber it has a bug that if you change something on it during a trade , it reprocesses and take of a percentage of the percentage you had just left . IE it does not check for what you have left on the table , it just blindly takes it off

Steves on the other hand has a protect lots function to stop this happening, unfortunatley it does not do the percenatge tiers functionallity discussed here

Personally I think the fact that we have the abitliy at all to auto close is a good enough thing in itself

IBFX has a partial close tool , I just joined them last week so will have a look at it UPDATE..... , great works to four percentage tiers, but only if your  trading with them

Hi EACoder,

Good work,

Have just loaded onto Demo and will monitor.

Appreciated.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi.. if people here think this kind of management is good i can code 3 or 4 level of percentage of TP in my EA....

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Great EA!

This would be superb, could you code an option to select how many TP's are required then at what percentage?

e.g.

Number of TP levels = 4

TP1= 25%

TP2= 25%

TP3= 40%

TP4 =10%

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Typical difficult Monday, with many price adjustments and positioning today for BIG moves....

Many pairs are at extremes, usdchf, usdjpy, usdcad. So be careful.

I will be mainly watching today, see how GU compares. It has been rejected so far by the upper band and 4hr ema, now we will see if the 1.6100 level holds and what happens next.

More updates to come, good luck.

michael

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thats interesting, a possible shakeout move before a rise during the London session. It will be important to see if GU catches up on EU´s moves again. I will wait for higher highs building up and price closing decisively above the 50 ema bands for longs.

If not wait and see...

AUDUSD looks like a sell, usdchf for a buy. But we have enough TIME to jump in later when a solid base or top have been formed.

I will NOT touch usdjpy at all.

Nice to see how the EMA on the MACD signals us to stay out = ranging market. I marked the weekly highs and lows ( previous week ), they often provide more information than pivots, which are not often precise on Mondays......

Nice up move on EURUSD, and a premature sell on AUDUSD this morning, but normally they are correlated. All of this is so out of sync that I prefer to wait. Remember : low risk = capital preservation comes first.

Morning all,

I see alot of constructive comments have come in over the weekend and also some progress with an EA....... All good to see.

Looking at the pairings that I trade, there doesn't look as yet to be any imminent setups appearing but, no doubt, that will change.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
first of all sorry for my bad english... hope u understand ....

i started coding MultiTP.... but the percent of Lots you close in those TP is the 100% of the startlot... so the last tp is the original TP i set when i create the pos... example:

i create the pos with TP 100 and SL 100 Lot = 1

i create 4 intermedie TP every 20 pips (for this example)

so.. at 20 pips i close 0.25 lot

at 40 i close 0.25 lot

at 60 i close 0.40 lot

at 80 i close 0.10 lot but there are no more lot!!

The position is totally closed without touch the original 100 TP!

So i can code it with 3 intermedie TP and the fourth will be the TP i set when i create the Position.

It's true or not? if I'm wrong or if it still needs of 4 intermedie TP please answer me!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #242 ---
This way is fine for me 3 intermediate and final closure of all , but maybe see what others say ,

Are you making it flexible , like if i want 30,30,30 and the rest 10,  or 20 50 20 and the rest 10.(parameterizable)

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Here Ronnie EA V 1.1

I Add the Multiple Take Profit Option... you have 3 intermediate customizable take profit and the final TP.

Now i only post the installation version because sometimes i changhe my libraries so if you don't have the right lib it doesn't work.

In this package:

Ronnie V1.1

Indicator

Libraries

Ronnie Template

When you want to uninstall all this you can find Ronnie V1.1 in your program list and you can delete all those files using the uninstall.

Report here bug, settings and ideas!!!

Happy Pipping!

PS. You can use Multiple TP and Trailing Stop at the same time!

PPS. If you find a good Settings please share your BT!

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Excellent Thanks EA coder , I will set it up on demo tonight- have you done any backtesting on this yet

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I'm testing it now... but i'm coding many things togheter and it take some times to do BT with right settings.. || many var = many possibility || i hope that people here will BackTest it to find profitable settings (if exist LOL) and share to the community....

--- 帖子 #246 ---
thanks. trying.

could u advice on the fixed lot vs risk?

i can never figure that one out. tried it, good profit but still the lot doesnt does what as it sounded.

another one, can it be limited to only one position open?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
If you decide a fixed lotsize just write it in the Fixed Lot.. if you set it to 0 it will use risk percent....

EX.1

Fixed Lot = 1

Risk = 10

In this case it will ignore risk and will open all the position of 1 lot

EX2

Fixed Lot = 0;

Risk = 10

In this case every position that will open will risk 10% of your balance.

If your balance is 1000 EUR/USD/xxx and you lose this position yuo'll lose 100 EUR/USD/xxx

Hope you understand my bad english.... feel free to ask any question!

Hi EA Coder

Thankyou for the time you have spent on this EA.

Can I ask param about RetracementDistance Your readme describes this as :

RetracementDistance = It will lookinig for retracement only if the price will touch this distance from the retracement EMA

while ronnierotts rules say that ' the high low/ of the setup candle is NOT more than 50 pips away from the 15EMA (30 for G/J and U/C).

Maybe I'm wrong, and apologies if I am, but your RetracementDistance param doesn't sound the same thing?  Can you clarify?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi,

first the EA will look for MACD and EMA direction.. AFTER that it will look for a distance between price and 15ema (RetracementDistance) when this distance is reached the EA will look for the retracement with 15EMA.

In attachments i add a pic to explain...

Sorry for my bad english... hope you understand

--- 帖子 #250 ---
i must say, i admire your passion for coding. i give u a thumbs up!

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thanks for the explanation, however I cant find this rule in the system.  Did you add it? Is this how the EA know's there has been a retracement, by this distance?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
A show of hands, whoever is keen on using Ronnierott's 1 Hour Strategy, to use it on a 15M chart?

I'm thinking of asking Ronnierott to open up a new thread for those who're keen on 15M chart, then we can all discuss there, instead of cluttering here, e audience here belongs to 1H chart.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
This system is looking for a retracement in a trend market, i think that to find a retracement you need something like the pic i show you before.. however you can set it very small ( 5 ) if you don't want a big swing...

for coding reason i suggest to not set it to 0..

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Kedridder

I would be interested (if I had the time), I think this system has potential at all TF's . I am not sure of the values of the MA's and EMA with MACD at the differents TF . This is always something that confuses me --- what to adjust to what level or do we keep it the same

Unfortunatley I only have time to check once an hour max , setting with the rigid setting of 100 sl 100 tp and just see how it performs,I will fine tune later (trailing, different TF, different R:R  etc when I am confident it works with the basic setting , which I believe it does

One step at a timer for me
EACoder

Going to set up the EA on say 10 PRS this morning with OOTB settings. are the OOTB settings quite good?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
thanks for ur contribution peterporter.

well, i have adjusted ronnierott's exit strategy and i appreciate his opening of original thread, giving me a good idea on e entry. Thus, i complement his system with mine and i come out with an all-new exit system. However, my respect for Ronnierott, i will not open a thread, taking his credit. I'll seek his approval before i open one for further discussion.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Sorry mate i don't have understand your question.... 10PRS? OOTB?.... can you explain please... i'm sorry about my eng!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Sorry , I mean I am going to put your EA on ten different currency charts (10 pair ie GBPUSD, USDCHF etc

and I will be using the default settings (OOTB means Out Of The Box)

If it proves to not be triggering trade or be  profitable I will strart tweaking as I see best OK

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks for explaining that.

Does the EA contain logic for this rule 2?

" When the price hits the 15 EMA & bounces off or goes through the 15 EMA and reverses back it's a trade AS LONG AS:-.......the high low/ of the setup candle is NOT more than 50 pips away from the 15EMA (30 for G/J and U/C)."

--- 帖子 #259 ---
@PETERPORTER

OK.. i understand!

the settings are not optimized.. i'm doing some BT and hope that someone else is doing BT!!

@STRICKY1967

The EA doesn't control the distance of H/L from the fast ema.

Hi guys,

It seems this thread has been taken over by EA development...

I'm not sure if this a good or bad thing.

Anyway hope it works...

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hiya EA

can you give us V1.1 in ex4 or mq4 cos your installer asks me to close down all EA's on my "always on server" which unfortunatey means closing down live EA on my live account, This action normally buggers up my pending live trades

Ta

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Your right

Can someone Please start an EA Thread for this cos I would like to have two threads

The starter doesnt necessarily need to input to it , maybe "EA broker" , or I can for him if he allows

Ronnie , you just need to edit Post 1 with a link to the EA thread

Saying "if anyone is interested for an EA of this strategy here it is" and link

and for the person who starts the EA thread Saying "if anyone is interested for the manual method here it is" and link

--- 帖子 #263 ---
On the very first post, Ronnierott specifies:

"Change the MACD parameters to read 35,70,1,12"

I wish to do this manually, and on the Oanda charts/platform the MACD only takes 3 parameters.

Appreciate your insights.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Oanda charts CMI, v simple charting.

i suggest u use MetaTrader to view your chart

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Its the MACD with EMA that is supplied in post 1 you have to change

you can chnage it in the code if you want so you dont need to change it in the parametization table every time

UPDATE sorry didnt realize you did not have Metatrader, yeh just do what Kedridder says

--- 帖子 #266 ---
put every files in the right folder..

--- 帖子 #267 ---
let me know if I no longer have to post in this thread (and tell me where to get them) .. Ronnie EA, however,  is also valid for use manual .. if you disable autotrading will notify you  the retracement and in version 1.2 and will show support and resistance!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thanks EA coder for the seperate file , excellent

We see what Ronnie says about another thread for the EA later

Happy Trading

UPDATE smiley faces on lots of 1Hour charts , Lets see the pips come in

I've gone to the trouble of installing Metatrader; pls see the below: I cannot see where you would enter that "mysterious"  4th parameter, as I know that MACD is only usually specified by three parameters, the fast, slow & smoothing ma.

I am sorry this is the first time I use metatrader; I wish to do this manually and not via EA at present.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Did you download the MACD as stated in post #1 ? It should go in your experts/customindicator file in MT4.

Then in the standard indicator list you will find " Moving Average ", that is where you set the 50 EMA`s and the 15 EMA.

Hope that helps.

( In babypips.com and fxstreet.com and here on FF in Platform Tech you will find numerous guides how to install indicators in Metatrader etc. and on YT numerous videos as well )

Many thanks michael; it seems that the MACD indicator used by Ronnierott cannot be just "made" manually. I missed the point of using the special macd; I think i have it now.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
EU failed to take out resistance @ 1.3855 -60 and entered a range. Currently I believe we are very much in ranging mode until ECB news on Thursday and NFP news on Friday.

GBPUSD caught up on EU, but that was too volatile for me.

I note that usdchf has been very much supported at its lows, it is now barely moving at all. This can be a clue for big boys supporting it heavily and preparing for a substantial move higher during the next weeks.

Will post setups if they occur. Sorry for rare posts, but at the moment I haven`t found my low-risk juicy " no-brainers "....

Take care,

Hi guys, ive been lurking this site from months but it's the first time i see something so interesting.

Right to the point, can't you see a potential (not confirmed) setup candle here?

I mean, it's true that I should have place an order here (then not executed)?

Thaks a lot, i love this thread!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Ok... after this i will stop coding on this project until new ideas, suggestion or settings come in.

In this version i fix a bug on lotsize management during multiTP (you need to set the min lotsize that your account could trade)

Add support and resistence option..

Happy Pipping

PS. In attachment Installer version and Files version.. if you use file version you need to put all the files in the right folders..if you have older files of ronnie libraries you need to rewrite with those in 1.2.

To do it easier use the install version!

mark here.

Probably about 5 - 6 setups per week approx.

As for % wins - In the last 3 months it's approx 35 wins, 12 losses and about 12 B/E.

great!!!

is that easy to backtest for other months?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
is that for EURUSD?

hi, friend,

Have you used your ea to backtest the original strategy? Does that work? We need to backtest it for 2 or 3 years to see if it works or not. If it works in a long run. we just get a diamond.

and then, we can improve it by change the sl, tp, etc. But first, we need to make sure the original strategy works in a long run.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I let the EA run all day long on the 4 pairs but no trade, i suppose there were no setup today...

I'd like to test my comprehension asking you a quick evaluation of the attached chart.

I know this pair is not in the comfort list, anyway, is this a valid setup candle?

Should an order be placed on the pink line?

Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Setup looks good.... But just remember that if any subsequent candles close below the 15 EMA (prior to the pending order being activated), then cancel the pending order and wait for the next setup.

I hope you can help me, thanks a lot and great work!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
If any of you are getting impatient waiting for the perfect setup on the 1H time frames , do try going down to the lower timeframes ,

This will often be the case when you get a very strong trend , you will find that there is hardly any retracement and its crazy just to sit there waiting for it to retrace , watching those pips go by , When you could get an entry as per ronnies rules on a lower time frame ie.. PA peircing the 15MA , then bouncing up again

just make sure you look at the overal trend on the higher TF and study  SR levels, like round numbers , pivot levels  at these lower time frames

(I share with you the fustration when you want to test a system and you cant cos of no opportunities  arising on the higher TF's, makes you want to give up and look at lower TF systems, Well this works on the lower TF !!!  )

--- 帖子 #290 ---
your EA is not activated , you need a smiley face

Make sure you have Allow Live Trading , in Tools , Options , Expert Advisers, and also your EA switch is on

Right, thanks a lot

Ronnierott, thank u for ur blessing. i'll shelf this for now, seems there's no one keen in going into lower TF.

I know peterporter is, but he has time constraint.

never mind, i'll test it and let whoever who wants to share, to do it via PM or other ways. cheers!

--- 帖子 #293 ---
dude, im keen. always been interested in 15m 15 - 20 pips thingy.

previously before ronnierott came with this. im playing with some stuff ema as well. and working on the bounce, never got completed.

OK pending order set

have you had any other trades this week Ronnie?

I got stopped out, with a 50 SL,  on 3 think it was Monday/Tuesday.

Only to watch them all bounce late Tues.

Will set SL at 100 for this one

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi Ronnie

Is this your first trade this week on your strategy due to the fact that you have not seen any other oppurtunities until now or just that you have been busy with other things

Do you trade live full time with other systems aswell , so not too worried for the wait

Would you normally just check the state of play once an hour as per the rules

I ask these questions cos I want to balance I suppose my life with trading and not just be stuck in front of charts all day

Especially as the summer starts to arrive  I would like to make the most of it with my son  yet trade still , but at a slower pace and a system like this could hold the key

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Order cancelled (candle closed below 15 EMA)

Wait for next setup.....

--- 帖子 #306 ---
NFP tomorrow, think we may get ranging markets until then.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I know it would be obvious to cancel a live trade normally, but you use 100SL for a reason

If that trade you just cancelled , had been triggered instead then , about 2 * 1hr candles later it went down, would you cancel it or wait and see

The reason being you would cancel a pending but would you cancel a live in the same conditions cos at 100 SL I am sure we know that the retracement is larger than we anticipated

Just like to know what you would do in the case of a triggered trade

Update , cos I bet you wish you hadn't cancelled it now

WELL NOW my internet keeps on cutting out so might aswell give up for the day

--- 帖子 #308 ---
yup, nobody can expect such a spike to happen. ronnierott's reacting according to the rules.

if it's a spike down instead of spike out, he'll breathe a sigh of relief, that it was cancelled. no point giving away the SL to the brokers.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
i delete the order if macd rules changhe..

and have a lucky trade today!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Pete,

Trades using this strategy that I've had this week are:-

1/3 - G/U still in play, currently +10

1/3 - G/J still in play, currently +32 (SL @ BE)

My job sometimes gets in the way of trading but I'm usually able to see the charts each hour...... which suits me.

I'm not a fan of scalping the smaller TF's, and not a fan of screen watching.

I only look for setups between 06.00 & 18.00 GMT and then the evening is my own.

I think the 1 HR TF is a great balance.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Once a trade has triggered for me that's it.

It either hits the SL,

or

Go to BE at +50 and then hopefully onto +100.

I am looking at partial TP points but have yet to decide at what levels.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Excellent thanks for all you answers,

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Possible trade on GBP/JPY, this a.m.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
The setup looks good............... But for me it's a no trade day today because of NFP.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Oh yeh forgot about that, closed position at b/e

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Typical , +50 now

--- 帖子 #317 ---
is this working for anyone ?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
for my opinion is a good system...

--- 帖子 #319 ---
it's a good system. watever system u use, please do ur due-diligence by doing your back-testing.

oh ya, today is an exception, cos it's NFP day. Please don't use this system on NFP day

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Just to check my understading of the rules, was your entry at around: 134.33 ?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
As I saw it:-

After close of 0600 GMT candle a pending order of 134.217 + spread would've been placed.

The 0800 GMT candle then closed below 15 EMA before pending order got triggered............ So, order cancelled.

The next candle to close above the 15 EMA was the 10.00 GMT candle, but its high was more than 30 pips from 15 EMA.... So, no trade.

Hope that makes sense.

Perfect, many thanks. Just for posterity (as the above explanation is great)

Recap on this weeks trades that I took:-

Not the best of weeks I must admit. But saying that, the G/J from 01/03 made its +100 TP today.

As for the G/U, it's still in play and currently -35 as we speak.

Not even many setups were there this week. Today had some but I won't trade this on NFP day, unless a trade is already on to which I then just let run.......

Hopefully a bit more action next week.

Until then, have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Most systems work , including this one , I like this cos of it simplicity and flexibleness of TFrames that can be used ,

But like most systems , the more important thing is not the entry but the surrounding land around the entry and the exit

Most systems are good for entries but the system will never be able to determine exactly when is the best time to exit or wether it is actually a good entry ,ie , its a lot riskier to put go long whe you are 20 pips below a convergence of a major round number , a pivot line  and a previous SR level

As far as exits are concerned you can either watch the inidicators, which is normally leaving it bit late cos indicators are base on PA ,

Or use PA and SR level which should give you a much closer exut and a few more pips

Its at the discretion of the trader, Also you must take into account R:R

The figure that Ronnie gives of 100 TP and 100 SL were given by him as a general guidance , the more confident you are of the trade the less the SL can be and hence the more lots you can put on if you are trading using MM

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Forgot to add 03/03 E/U.... +100

Please bear in mind that I personally only look for trades between 06.00 - 18.00 GMT.

Many thanks for the update's Ronnie, keeps us all in the picture and confirms we have the rules correct (charts of the trades would be great too  )

As requested, here's the setups I took this week.

EU +100

GJ +100

GU still in play, currently -40.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hello everybody,

nice system and many thanks to ronnierott for charing it!

Just for my humble understanding, when describing the rules for the entry, you are talking about a "setup candle". It's clear if price touches the 15 EMA and reverses within one candle, in that case that's the setup candle.

But if this happens not within one candle but within 2-3 candles? I guess the setup candle is the last candle, the candle that reverses / comes back through the 15 EMA. Is that right?

One other question concerning the described setup of EURUSD above: When I see that right, there was a touching of the 15 EMA (more precisely 2 times!) some candles before the entry Ronnierott took, is that observation right too ??

Thanks a lot and I wish you all a nice Sunday!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi Dortmunder & welcome to the thread.

In answer to your questions:-

The setup candle is the candle that touches the 15 EMA and closes above it (long trades) or below it (short trades) as long as all other criteria is met.

Ref the E/U trade. You are correct, there were candles previous to the one that I took (in fact there were 4) but for me they were in the middle of the night, and I only look for trades from 0600 GMT.

Hope it makes sense.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Ronnierott, thanks a lot! I understood the second part! But concerning the "setup candle", just considering the long trade scenario. What you describe is the case if ONE candle touches, bounces off and reverses ... but what if the first candle goes throug the 15 EMA, closes below and the second candle then reverses and goes through the 15 EMA (and reverses) ? Or is that not a valid setup according to your rules ?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
That is good to know, thankyou

--- 帖子 #333 ---
See chart below.

We'll call candle 1, the one on the left of box.

Here's the scenario as I see it:-

Candle 1 is a valid setup candle. Pending order is placed 10 pips above high.

Candle 2 does not activate order nor does it close below 15 EMA. Pending order still valid.

Candle 3 is the same as candle 2.

Candle 4 does not activate order but closes below 15 EMA. Pending order cancelled, wait for next setup.

Candle 5 closes below 15 EMA (just) Not a valid candle.

Candle 6 closes above 15 EMA. All other criteria met, this is now the setup candle. Pending order placed.

Candle 7 activates pending order.

Candle 8 closes below 15 EMA. If the pending order had NOT been triggered you would cancel it, however the order was triggered so ignore.

Candle 9..................... Happy days.

Hope this clarifies.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Thanks a lot for your additional effort! The penny has dropped!

Crucial to me was the fact that I must cancel the pending order if price closes below EMA 15 and I have to wait for a new setup! Very good example!

I wish you some more "happy days"

--- 帖子 #335 ---
You're welcome.........

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Perhaps another point, you have a SL of 100 pips and a TP of 100 pips. Have you ever thought of improving this risk-reward-ration? Or do you have - perhaps from your diary records - any experience if trades - after triggered once - which ran deeply into losses reversed and afterwards hit even TP ? My thinking is - or just an impression - if a trade ran directly in a loss situation e. g. about - 70 or 80 pips, the trade could even be cancelled because the probability of hitting the TP has dramatically sunken .... or am I completely wrong with that suspicion ?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi Ronnierott!!!

First thank you very much for sharing with us this system.

I have been reading your issue and I find very interesting for me!!

The last explanation you've done to Dortmunder ...I did understand your  system. Has been exceptional!!

Thank you very much and will continue to monitor your forum!

Sorry if my English is very bad!

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi guys,

I have been watching this thread for some time as the system looks very promising. The only thing that I do not feel comfortable with is R:R ratio, especially 100 pip SL that I find far too big for hourly chart. So, my question to ronnierott or any other user of the system is: are you absolutely sure that such a big SL is a must?

I have not traded this system yet but from my experience, the best SL for any TF is 2*ATR. So, if trading hourly charts, the optimal SL should be around 50 pip for EU, GU and GY, and 40 pip for UCH. Have you any evidence that it would be too small for this system?

And one more idea: what if we use 2*ATR also for maximum distance of H/L of the signal candle from EMA15? Depending on the ATR period we would have ~25 pip for EU M15 chart, ~50 pip for H1, ~100 pip for H4 etc...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
You're english is fine...................

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Risk/Reward............... Another great subject.

When I firstly started monitoring this strategy I was looking at what the best R/R would be.

Me personally, I will only ever trade with a R:R at 1:1 at worse.

I prefer the idea that if I were to lose 2 trades and then win 2 trades then I'd like to think that I would be at B/E.

Now, if we look at last weeks 2 trades that have closed:-

G/J trade 01/03........ This trade went to -95 pips and ended up +100.

E/U trade 03/03........ This trade went to -48 pips and ended up +100.

Trades need to have breathing space according to what T/F is being traded.

If I were to use this strategy on M15 then I would go with 20 & 20 for SL & TP.

I'd say that everything is relative to T/F's but a R:R of 1:1 is my minimum...............

--- 帖子 #341 ---
hello,

your strategy, even if it's based on moving averages and the requirement of a trending market, it remains the simplest and best way to trade for anybody on this lump of rock in space, good luck with your endeavors!

hi to you all and thanx for all of your efforts in making this system.

My question to Ronnierott is if he has donde a big backtesting of this systme????

Thanks again to you all

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Ronnie

I am a bit confused cos the E/U trade on the 03/03 was the one you cancelled cos it did not hit the pending but ended up below the MA

Please see post 305

Am i right or is there something I am missing

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I monitor trades on Metatrader and place trades with a spreadbetting firm. Depending on what broker was used for this trade could have given different results (it was that close).

I saw that Alpari would not have activated the trade hence when the candle closed below the 15 EMA I posted on the thread a cancel pending order.

When I then went to cancel my order with my spreadbetting firm I saw that the trade had been activated by them......... Different price feeds/spreads I guess.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi ronnierott, i'm a great supporter of your system and i can vouch, it can catch good PIPs.

may i add to your comments above?

in the previous posts, u said before, the candlesticks close below the 15 ema and it should be closed.

but this post which i replied on, you mentioned you gathered PIPs.

can i suggest more transparency, so as to avoid confusion?

i have back and forward tested your system and i find it works well. if i'm new to the thread, i'll think you're trying to promote your system more than anything else, and will skip this system.

i hope my comments above is constructive and i apologise if any words are offensive in any ways. Cheers and have a good trading week!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Can some some show a setup for a "Sell" trade ; I am understanding the Buy side, but am confused with how the Sell trade would look like.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi Ronnierott,

Attached, i have 2 diagrams. AUDJPY and EURJPY for comparison sake.

Looking at the macd-ema part (as circled in yellow), does the distance between the dark blue line and majenta line, make a difference when you choose your trade? -

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Lakeluke,

Please see attached diagram. Candle #1 pierced thru 15ema. Candle #2 rebounced back and close below 15ema. Candle #2 here, is the setup candle. Using this as an example, enter a sell stop 20 PIPs below the low of candle #2. Hope my explanation is clear.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi Kedridder,

The further the MA is in the coloured area the better.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Entry would be 10 pips below the low of candle 2.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
oh, thanks for e correction.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
got it! thank u.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Am I right

A signal could be coming on USDCHF in 8 mins

I wouldnt say its the best of signals but as per the rules its a signal nonetheless

pending at 0.92370

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Correct.

Sell stop @ 0.9236

--- 帖子 #356 ---
that's right! coming from the man himself.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
order set

--- 帖子 #358 ---
still valid!

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Many thanks; it's clearer now. Ofcourse as Ron' said it's 10 pips and not 20.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
yup, it's my bad.

10 PIPs, not 20. sorry

--- 帖子 #361 ---
If anyone interested getting in there is a signal of GBPCHF at the moment , pending at 1.50440

In fact it is just about to get eaten

Again not the clearest of signals but maybe ronnie can clarify that indeed it is a signal

if it gets past 1.50500 Round number , it could fly

--- 帖子 #362 ---
By this system yes, but i doubt usd/chf will go down another 100 pips in the coming 1 week.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
As per the rules, I think it's invalid as the 15 EMA is too close (nearly touching) to the 50 EMA.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Oh yeh
RULE 3. DO NOT TRADE WHEN THE 15 EMA IS INSIDE OR VERY CLOSE TO THE 50 EMA CHANNELS.

This is an interesting one cos we can see the 15EMA edging away from the 50 EMA channels as it repaints itself and by the time (if) it triggers it could be quite far away

Also i think its been asked before . What constitutes very close ?

Zoom  in on it

BAD SIGNAL

--- 帖子 #366 ---
not sure but i think a text book entry is forming on eur/usd. would love a confirm

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I prefer it if it's at least 6 pips away from the 50 EMA

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Depends on if the current candle closes above the 15 EMA.  But saying that, I'd prefer it if the MACD MA was more into the coloured area.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
its good but that silly MACD EMA isnt in the MACD histogram very much as per

Rule 1

Well its actually not silly cos it makes sure you have a good trend before committing

UPDATE , Wow that does look a good entry , shame about the MACD

--- 帖子 #370 ---
yep well its been triggered , just gotta wait and see, could quite easy come back down again considering the general trend is down on H4 and H1

have faith , its not over to the fat lady sings

--- 帖子 #371 ---
well, this pair certainly didnt give me a good time. Yellow area is my setup candle.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
EU - that's a no trade on my chart, closed with MA line outside of coloured area on MACD

--- 帖子 #373 ---
well damn, entered before i saw response, well... if i win drinks are on me

--- 帖子 #374 ---
The candle you had in question was a valid setup although the 15 EMA was a bit too close to the 50 for my liking..... All about ones comfort zone.

However, 2 candles on looked alot better.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Yeh quite an interesting one that

The rate at which it went up and came down did not really impact the MA

Trouble is, what we do in demo is always more courageous to what we do in Live

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Morning all,

GBP-USD nearly generating a sell signal:

--- 帖子 #377 ---
The signal candle for GBP/CHF has appeared, 2 hours ago;

based on it I think we should place a Sell at 10 pips below it low; so Sell @ 1.49937

Lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
GBP/USD ????????

--- 帖子 #379 ---
sorry, meant gbp/chf; i'll edit the post. Thanks. Is the signal correct?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
sell signal at closing of 05:00am candle on GBP/JPY

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Is the following analysis correct:

Candle (1) was the initial "setup" candle;

however after candle (2) closed above the 15EMA line, it becomes the new setup candle.

Waiting to see what transpires with Candle(3) ; moving the original sell stop order to 10 pips below candle 2. Is that correct?

thanks.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Candle 2 closed above 15 EMA.......... Cancel order and wait for new setup.

If candle 3 closes below 15 EMA and all other criteria is met then that is the new setup candle

--- 帖子 #383 ---
got it; I think it's nearly sunk in. thanks for mentoring.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Morning all

GBPUSD could be interesting for a sell cos we had a fall from a triple top yesterday

If it goes past yesterday low of 1.61822 , away she goes

UPDATE - Sorry I just realized it did not, penetrate the Fast MA beforehand, (shame)

--- 帖子 #385 ---
yeah, but if u go according to the rules, there's no setup candle at all.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
UPDATE - Sorry I just realized it did not penetrate the Fast MA beforehand, (shame)

Ive still taken it though cos on my other system its a signal to sell                           http://www.forexfactory.com/images/m...ading_dark.gif

-100 on USDCHF , not a great start to the week

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I am runner EAcoder's EA on a demo with 6 pairs [EU, GU, UCHF, AU, UJ, GJ] and have done so for around 1 week now and haven't had any signals.

Are others getting the same inactivity or is there some setting that I need to change

Current setting I have are those OOTB

--- 帖子 #392 ---
According to the rules, Candle(1) or Candle(2) were good "setup"  candles; hence enter trade at 10 pips below their Low for a "Sell-Stop"  order.

However after entering this trade, it then went negative; the rules normally state 100 SL;

As a new idea, why not take the SL to be the point 3, i.e. when the MA on the MACD goes outside it.

Advantage: A smaller possible loss on the trade.

Disadvantage here would mean that you would have to watch the trade more carefully;

however, I think still set the SL at 100 pips, but at the same time, when the MACD MA goes outside like Pt3, then kill the trade.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi,

I am following this thread and it is great strategy. This is my first post. I identified the Sell setup candle. I attached the JPG files. Can some confirm it. The Setepup candle is highlighted in Yellow colour.

Many Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Interesting, I will have a look back and see if thats a good idea

Must admit , I normally use 100 SL on trades set up on H4

would normally be around 50 SL for H1

Your just talking about the SL cos the same could be said for the TP as a good place to take your profits maybe or even a trade thats not moving will have the EMA eventually leave the MACD, another sign to bail out cos the trend is over

Does sound worth testing , my next trades I wil try that

Remember everyone , the idea about the forum is to share thoughts and ideas and not necessarily just stick to the rules , hence the forums would be a pretty dull affair and  good systems could  not evolve;

Ronnie would agree on that I sure

--- 帖子 #395 ---
your right Peter, and without wanting to change too much Ron's obviously successful strategy, as it has worked for him well; new ideas are useful. I hope Ronnierott does not mind too much.

--- 帖子 #396 ---

Hello all

Interesting thread - definitely subscribing!

One question re the MACD.  I use ProRealTime charts and only have 3 fields available for the MACD settings, yet this version requires 4.  What do I do?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
You will have to download Metatrader , analyse your charts and entries on that, but actually trade on Prorealtime

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thank for that. You are right my 15 EMA is set to low. I changed it now. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
If we zoom out on the 1H for this losing trade , it had actually stopped trending and was in a ranging , consolidation period , so really did not have the legs in the first place

Looking just before that it had a great trending period finishing around 240211

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hello Highroller; love the indicator at the bottom of your chart, with all that price info. Do you mind sharing/attaching it here ?

thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
hey lake,

see attached range indicator...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
many thanks highroller.

From the various charts I am looking at it appears only U/C G/J and G/U have any potential setup candles appearing in the next few hours.

Hi Lakeluke

Im using your rule for the 4 trades   I have open re the SL and TP and seem quite a good idea GBPUSD AUDUSD USDCHF and the loser GBPJPY which i should never if taken anyway in the first place

the winners all have the ema within the macd -nice  and the gbpjpy just on the edge of coming out of the MACD hist at around -40 pips although its got a bit better now

--- 帖子 #407 ---
hi all, i am new to lakeluke setup. Attached please find the setup on my chart.

is it correct? i would apply it to e 4 pairs as mentioned in e first thread.

Hope someone can guide me in entering the trade.. thanks

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Welcome,

Firstly you need to change your MACD settings as per post #1

--- 帖子 #409 ---
i have backtested this strategy (from jun,2008, to jun 2009), it's 23wins, 22 losses. sorry to say that it's not a valid system. (I followed the system strictly.)

to make the backtest easy, i add some codes to the original macd-with-ema indicator to show the enter level, BE level, sl, and tp level.

you can download this indicator(Ronnierott's 1 Hour Strategy alert 4.mq4,put it in to the indicator folder ) and the template to see my backtest results. ( jun,2008, to jun 2009, my fxpro platform is gmt+2). and you can backtest in other periods yourself.

on the charts attached, the white horizontal line is the entey level, the green level is BE level(50 pips above the enter level), the blue line is the tp level, and the red line the sl level. setup bar is at the right of those lines.

if you backtest in other periods, please save it as a template and upload it. let's share the backtest results.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi all.. here my version of Ronnie EA 1.3.

Like usual you can use it for autotrading or just for entry signal.. i have fixed a order bug and add some features like Breakeven, auto distance order setting, comment on pivot and customize pivot timeframe.

Happy Pipping!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Thanks EA Coder

I will be using this for entry signals on the lower TF's

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi bobowant

I like your EMA MACD backtester alert excellent

I agree with you on the results if we remain strict

I think the results can be improved if discretion is used on the trades

For me the fact that you have approx 50 50 with STRICT results gives me alot of optimism for using this system for entries , but for exits I think 100 TP 100 SL are figures that wer just given by ronnie as a general guide

If people use this as enter as per rules, 100 SL 100 TP they will be dissapointed

If they use this as an entry systm but use there discretion for SL and TP  at pivot level , sr , trailing stops etc then they are on, to a winner

Another thing, I am going to to put my entrie at BE + 25  when it gets to + 50  from now on so I get 25 pips profit

Question for you . what about all the trades that have gone to BE with zero loss ,  are they just not given as they are irrelevent so for example you have 23 wins, 22 losses and say 30 Break evens . Sorry i have no time to look at your result to see if you have done this, this morning

I can backtest a certain time and currency pair

Maybe we should work all together and different people test different currency pairs

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi bob , I have your Alerter in EURUSD now and its just given me a signal , yet the setup candle has not closed yet

--- 帖子 #414 ---
the BE trades are 18 in that period.

if you change be+25 each trade, some winning trades will end up with BE(25pips). I think it still will be a random walk.

and if the entry give no edge to you, why you still use it? you can enter everywhere!

personally, I like  ronnie, he gave out his trading rules very clear and easy to backtest. but unfortunately,I think the strategy doesn't work.

most of the post starters here in ff didn't mentioned their trading rules clearly, and always use subjective way to trade, nobody else can repeat their claimed results (they also don't show us any proven long history results).

I just think there is no proven effective trading system in FF.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
no, no, no, it's only for backtest. you can't use it in live trade. because I just judge the entry level based on the close of every bar. you will get a late signal if you use it in live trade.

in your case, my indicator just use the current price as a close price of the current bar, it's useless. so it's only for backtest!!!

please backtest this system in different periods or different pairs to see if it works or not before you trade live or demo!

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Pls, it's not "lakeluke's" setup; Ronnierott is the one who came up with thread and method.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I understand

but for me it works, maybe cos I look at other factors when placing trade

The overal trend of higher TF is important to me , the "hot pair" as defined in the DIbs method , divergence, OB  OS conditions and reversal patterns before actually committing to a trade

This is true I agree if you blindly use ronnies rules but if as I say you use discretion then I dont agree

Lets see what Ronnie has to say

--- 帖子 #418 ---
OK i understand ta

Although its given me a good signal anyway

BOB When I bring up say AUDUSD H4 and drag on your indicator , none of your signals appear

Am I doing something wrong

I really would like to test on the larger timeframes with better trends

aH i JUST gotta change the tp and SL levels ok

Hold on there

Is anyone talking on this thread or is it just me

--- 帖子 #419 ---
EA can I have the seperate files again thanks

--- 帖子 #420 ---
If you find a proven system , strictly sticking to the rules , then you have found the HOLY GRAIL and every man and his dog  will be using it

Think about it , if I claimed that if you do this by the book then you will win , then an EA would be written and just left to run  bv every institiution in the land

No one will ever find that and the only way to trade is to trade manually and look at the lay of the land , like NiceGuy , be a SNIPER and take into account what I mentioned above regarding Pivots SR Trend etc

--- 帖子 #421 ---
here it is

remember:

ronnie in experts

graph, tradelib, moneyman in expert/libraries

*.tpl are template..only if u like!

bbye

--- 帖子 #422 ---
cheers EA, your the man

Nows the time to buy USDCAD I thinksy

--- 帖子 #423 ---
sorry for that, i used a sentence in the indicator:           ObjectSet("a"+i,OBJPROP_TIMEFRAMES,OBJ_PERIOD_H1);

so, that's why no lines showed in other tf. just because the 100pips tp,sl is only for 1h chart and is unchangable, I limited the 1h tf to show the lines.

it's not an indicator to publish, only to backtest ronnie's original strategy.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks Bob I'll change the code to suit , no worries

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Anyone get spiked out?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
No I closed that one yesterday at 1800 CET

I dont play by the rules much when it comes to exits, sorry  so not very good to comapre with , but I see what happened

Bit of a strange day all round really

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi all, first like to apologise, make a mistake, this should be Ronnierott 's strategy.

By the way, just saw this GBPJPY, is this a false trade? thanks

--- 帖子 #428 ---
you did according to e rule, so not to worry.

even if the trade turns bad, it's a well-taken trade. i refer to, "well-taken trade" here, means all rules taken into account for.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
anyone still on ronnierott's system?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
i try this sytem too, very slow and no stress method

In the most often of cases, you place your stoploss to 100 pips ?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
nope, i modify the exit strategy and i use a shorter TF to trade. i use e M15 chart

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Yes , its been rather slow on 1H lately

2 trades stopped out this week -200 pips

Do you have much success on M15?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
i try other method in M15, but nice idea, give us your results after for m15

--- 帖子 #434 ---
today, i just picked 23 PIPs using this system.

USDCAD.

whether any success, i cant give u a definite answer. wat i can say, it depends a lot on whether market condition can give you the PIPs or not.

what i love abt this system is, the rules are good.

what i dislike is, the R:R of 1:1.

how abt you? wats your result for this system?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Will there be a setup soon for SWISSY?

Ok, here's a round up of trades for this week and last.

Conditions haven't been the best but have come out unscathed for the last fortnight.

Last weeks G/U ended up a loser, so last week finished up +100.

As for this week, U/CHF activated and just didn't go into credit and ended up hitting S/L.

G/J from yesterday was pretty much the same, but G/U from Tues did hit T/P so for the week so far -100.

So to be B/E for the fortnight isn't that bad considering how the markets have been recently.....................

wow, cool!

anyway, there's still a slight difference. there's no black or blue arrows to tell u which is the setup candle. u need to figure out and determine it yourself. more 'flexible', in a way if u use ronnierott's system.

Not the best of weeks so far, what with all the trouble going on with Japan etc.

Thought I'd just post the trades that I've had for the this week:-

14/03 G/J -100

14/03 E/U ended up closing at B/E

14/03 U/CHF - +100

15/03 U/CHF - Still in play and currently +64 with S/L now @ B/E.

Worst case scenario if current trade hits S/L is B/E for the week as we speak.

Nothing much at the moment

Always consolidation times until about now , and especially after yesterdays large movements , hence it makes the EMA too close to the MACD

I look on other pairs like AUDUSD USDCAD etc aswell.

p_val = iRSI(TradePair[i], TradePeriodTF[j], 3, PRICE_CLOSE, 1);

delta_val = MathAbs(c_val - p_val);

period 3 , closing price, difference between current and last price shift greater than a certain amount ==  if(delta_val > ValueChange_2)

Hi Nikita

I think the markets all over are very volatile after the terrible events of the past week

All currencies are sporadic in movement at the moment

I have not bothered with the 1 Hour chart this week , just been scalping here and there

--- 帖子 #472 ---
yea i agree.. but not tryin to be negative ere..

but i have been tryin this method out for 2 weeks..

losses are more than winning.. and ive tried 30m,1h,4, even to 1d...

im hoping its just me.. as i placed certain confidence into this system..

does anyone has better luck using this/ better results using this in live?

thanks again

--- 帖子 #473 ---
nikita

IMHO two weeks is not a considerable period to give up on a strategy.

i have had six trades so far & four have won

stick on one time frame, H1 seems to be idle most of the time

USDCHF has done very good on this strategy for me, trade only four pairs

i am on demo & you are maybe live .. i suggest to try this strategy for two months on demo first ( u"ll know if it's fear or "live" which ruins game)

keep eyes zoomed on only good setups & follow lawgirl's trend display as an additional filter .. make sure while taking trade atleast H1,H4,D1 agree with trend direction or atleast H1,H4 should, for me D1 is a dictator as well.

i showed this great strategy to one of my friends & he quickly realised it's worth by giving an example of a professional trader who made lot of money by just playing within strong trends (bounce/retrace) instead of breakouts, though people earn from BO as well.

in the end,   PLEASE POST CHARTS OF TRADES.

hawk.. yes i agree on your opinion..and thats y i am still followin this thread..and i do admit 2 weeks is very short to demo..that is why im hoping bad results are coming from me..

ronnie..impressive results..need to ask..all your trades placed are only in 1h ??

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
nice, thanks for the update

RSI 3 period. Each time frame...If the RSI is pointing 12oclock -2oclock it's considered long..2-4 considered flat..4-6 considered short.

E/U buy @ 1.4172.  Currently + 34.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi Ronnierott, do u mind putting in these 2 pairs in terms of charts, so we know where your entry point is, ie which part of the day u executed them?

this way, we can learn better.

thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Well done

The EU one,  I opted out of cos the EMA was a bit too close to the edge of the MACD outline

I reckon this one might go south tonight

--- 帖子 #482 ---
No probs, will do them later. But for info, the G/J setup candle was at 06.00 GMT and the E/U candle was at 09.00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
It was close, but was just in the MACD area.  The G/J setup was ideal

--- 帖子 #484 ---
have you quantified what you mean by,"too close," to the 50 EMA channel? 10 pips? 50 pips? Pippo

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi Pippo,

I like to see the 15 EMA away from the 50 EMA by at least 6 pips.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Here's todays setups....

S/Losses are both now B/E.

G/J is now +70

E/U is now +57

--- 帖子 #487 ---
congrats ronnie, looks some neat work !

i shall join you guys in first week of april as going on a trip.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
No new setups today.

Yesterday's G/J ended up hitting the T/P @ +100 & the E/U trade is still in play @ +27....

I'm only stating trade setups for the pairings that I personally use, which are E/U, G/U, G/J & U/CHF.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
One questione concerning the EA: I used the EA for G / J and in the last days the EA produced about 8 stop buy orders - all not triggered for now. Is that alright according to the rules or the EA logic ?

Thanks for a short input!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hello everyone, i've made a few trades using this strategy of ronnies and i consider it to be a very good strategy. That's why i made an indicator that alerts you and also draws an arrow as a signal whenever the conditions of this strategy are met. Here it is, i hope it will be of use.

The indicator only gives entering signals and doesn't take into consideration the part where if there is a setup candle and the next one crossest the ema15 back and closes you have to delete the pending order and wait for another one.

The conditions of the indi are (for a long trade) :

- close above ema15

- ema15 > ema50(applied to high) + 6 pips

- high > ema15

- high < ema15 + 50 pips

- low <= ema15

- low > ema15 - 50 pips

- low > ema50 (applied to high)

- macd ema(the yellow one) < macd signal (the colored zone)

- macd ema > 0

- macd signal > 0

- close > open

the conditions are applied for the setup candle.

(for a short trade they are the opposite)

Ronnie please correct me if any of these conditions are wrong or should be corrected.

Oh.. and also.. for this indicator to work you have to have the "Macd-with-EMA.mq4" indicator that ronnie posted at the begining of the thread.

Update : I've modified the indi a little bit, i've resolved a bug with the alert system. It was alerting on every pip (very annoying). Plus i've added the TF and pair to the alert. So now it will say for ex. "Place BUY STOP at "price" on EURUSD, TF: H1". Please replace the other one with this one.

Update : Exculded Close > Open(for long) and Close < Open(for short) condition. Ronnie said that candle color does not matter.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Excellent jubu

few questions

1. I have just pu it on to 15m TF will it work for that aswell

2. Can I backtest with it

3. can you set an Alert at the same time as the arrow is shown  please with the symbol pair and direction and TF.ie "Sell on GBPUSD 15m" and maybe an option to email instead of alert

Ta

Peter

--- 帖子 #492 ---
1. Well it will work on any TF, but it was made for this strategy so it works best on 1H. I don't know how good the signals will be on other timeframes.

2. what kind of backtesting ?

3. It allready has the alert system. When the arrow appears the alert goes off and tells you to buy stop or sell stop, and the price (10pips + high). I will update ii so that it shows pair and tf too...

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Great job Jubu,

The parameters look good.  I will put it on the charts and monitor.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
thank u jubu. your indi makes the setup candles easier to see.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi Peter, i feel this system does not work well in 15m TF.

i have attached two charts, doesnt look great, lots of whipsaw.

TF of 1H, definitely allows the chart to breathe more. but of course, your lot size have to be reduced significantly.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hiya Kedridder

Yeh there does seem to be  alot  of whips,

I am only placing trades that go in line with the higher trends, rather than against the trends

If it proves good that way i will report back

--- 帖子 #497 ---
yeah, please do. thanks peter!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I've updated the indi. Please see my first post. #490

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Your the man!!!!  thanks jubu

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hi all, looks like there's no setup today on H1 TF?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Ronnie i have 1 question. Does the color of the setup canld matter (close < open or close > open) as long as all the other conditions are met ?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
of indicator's presence on 20+ charts.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
is that yesterday's setup candle?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
3/22.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
thank you.

my question is, whether anyone here found any setup candles 'today', 3/23.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
perfectly. Just demonstrating what I have to date with indy.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
jubu

though i am on a trip & checked this thread for important updates only,
i never miss a chance to thank anyone.

thanks a ton man... for the ronnie's indicator, i had thought about asking someone to make that once i was back, but i am very glad to see it being already done !!

cheers man

rishi

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Does not matter

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hello jubu,

Thanks for the indicator, I'll try it for sure.

Would you make the source available so that I could add some features ? If you prefer not to make it available (I would understand of course), could you add an e-mail alert to it ?

Regards,

Khad

--- 帖子 #510 ---
yeah, i second that. email alert will make e indi perfect!

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Guys, we may have a 1H TF setup for EURUSD to short. However, e distance between the ema and shadow of the candle is approx 32 PIPs. the rule of the system is nothing more than 30 PIPs. what say you? take or no take?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I think it's 50 pips for EURUSD, so I would place the stop order...

--- 帖子 #513 ---
JUbu

thanks for your indicator..

however..i dont see anything 'different' (from alerts to lines) when i attached it to the chart..

is there something i did wrong?

can you post a screen shot to show me how does it look like?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
yes, you're right. thanks for pointing it out.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Anyway, it's been invalidated by the candle that closed above the 15 EMA.

Now it looks like a setup is forming on USDCHF H1. Am I right ?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
looks like GBPJPY is being set up.. am i right ?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Wow just touching the FastMA, so yes ,- see what happens in the next 30 mins. Might have to watch Pivot line S1 at 130.828 . its already tested it once

although according to the rules the sell stop will be at 130.622 so should be past it when its activated

--- 帖子 #518 ---
its close, but not yet.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
interesting

mine shows it hits it . anyway no big shakes wether someone takes it or not as its repainting at the moment until the hour hits

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Distance between 15 EMA and candle low is a bit more than 30 pips, so per rules it isn't valid.

What do you guys think ?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
i see. i guess we're using diff broker, dats y the difference

--- 帖子 #522 ---
in my opinion, as per rule, it's valid

but as per individual's risk level, u can choose to skip this trade as its risky. for me, i'll skip this, cos too far from the ema

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Like I said I reckon S1 might be mucking it up  , It may consolidate here for a bit and then after that who knows which way it will go

UPDATE - she is good to go , if this breaks you will have a good trade to the downside, S1 is supporting it at the mo

--- 帖子 #524 ---
The setup candle closed above the 15 EMA, so is it valid or does it have to close below ?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
the setup candle becoome the current one in this instance- you really will see more of the picture  if you mark the round numbers and pivots etc

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I see. Thank you very much for the explanation.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Unfortunatley I dont play by the rigid rules of this - I entered this at 130.787

I use it for the signalling of entries , but I take into account other factors when placing the trade

Lets see if Support has become resistance now at 130.834

If it has its a good trade to take as a short even forgetting the 30 pip rule

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Nikita i don't know why you are having this problem. the indicator draws arrows above and below the setup candles and alerts you when they appear. Maybe you don't have the MACD-with-ema installed. If it's not that then check the experts or journal tab when you put it on to see what error it gives you.

Also i have done the update you guys asked me to do. I have put the SendMail option to it. For this to work you have to enable it by setting the SendEmail option from the indi properties to true and make sure that the email is set up correctly in the tools>options>email tab.

Also i don't know if you've noticed but i think that the previous candle on GBPUSD was a setup candle + a bearish engulfing.

Update : OK.. probably the last update. I fixed a bug. After closing and opening the MT4 the indicator did not redraw the arrows. You had to change the TF or remove and load the indi again for it to draw the arrows again. Now it works fine. Sorry for that bug.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
A few nearly trades today but only 1 that played by the rules.

G/U sell @ 1.61465.  Currently +30 with SL @ B/E

--- 帖子 #530 ---
guys, there's a setup for EURJPY on a H1 chart. good luck!

--- 帖子 #531 ---
well, on 2nd thought, i'll give this trade a miss. i found a v strong resistance here, on the yellow region. price may get rejected strongly there.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi guys, i've updated the indi again. Check this post #528. I fixed a bug. Sorry for that bug. This will probably be the last version, last update.

Also we have two setup candles today so far witch weren't triggered. E/G and  U/G 10:00 candle (GMT).

Also i've created an ea for the strategy with the conditions of the indi and the sl and tp fixed to 100 pips without break even (and with). I backtested it and found that the M30 is the most profitable TF on EURUSD only. I will continue testing it and tell you guys what i find. The 1H tf is also good (probably better) but the M30 gave the best results with the ea on this particular period of time (from nov 2010 to march 2011, about 5 months). Of course the ea doesn't take into consideration all the factors that a human could do so.... The profit factor was around 600%.. but don't get your hopes up cause that might have been just a lucky period... i'll keep you up to date with the research.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
thank u jubu, appreciate your contributions.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hello,

Do you keep positions open over the weekend, or do you close them before the end of the week ?

Thanks,

Khad

--- 帖子 #535 ---
If they are showing good profit then I will close them.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
The U/CHF from last week closed for a loss, so last weeks total was +345.

As for this week:-

21/03 G/J    +100

21/03 E/U    B/E

24/03 G/U    +100.

Alot quieter week than last week but still ended +200.

I can't complain at that.

Welcome to the thread..............

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Pending order:-

Sell E/U @ 1.40491

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Is the RonnieSignals indi working OK?

I didn't get a heads up ....hmmmmm

--- 帖子 #543 ---
No Nor did I

Still got in on the trade though

its been triggered now

Fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #544 ---
yes it's working fine. have you updated it ? see post  #528

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi Ronnie,

Gone through entire thread now. Looks good to me. I will demo from now with u.

Yes E/U nice setup candle. My trade triggered at 1.40510.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Yep, using that one shows as initialized in the journal and experts tab too....strange, does the indi show older 'arrows' or do I wait for the next setup to see if the indi is working?

thanks for your help

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Doesn't seem to be working on mine.

Journal tab says loaded successfully but experts tab is saying

2011.03.28 12:20:34 Cannot open file 'Crogram Files (x86)MetaTrader - Alpari UKexpertsindicatorsMacd-with-EMA.ex4' on the GBPJPY,H1.

Any ideas??

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Welcome..................

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Possible setup approaching on U/CHF...

--- 帖子 #550 ---
hmmm.. the problem seems to be with the Macd-with-EMA.ex4 indicator, maby you haven't installed the indi on the Alpari UK broker.... make sure that the c://Program Files/MetaTrader - Alpari UK/experts/indicators/Macd-with-EMA.ex4 exists.

yes the indi should show older arrows. make sure you downloaded the last one. post #528

--- 帖子 #551 ---
wadda ya reckon  EMA is close to the edge of the MACD

Will you go for it ??

--- 帖子 #552 ---
If it stays as is, I'm in.................

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Not the most convincing of signals given the 0.92000 round number and previous PA  but if you say so boss

UPDATE set at pending 0.9211 lets see what happens (incl spread of 2.6)

--- 帖子 #554 ---
so how is it ronnie ? is the indi working well for you? plese tell me so that i will make chages if there are more bugs. the indi is working fine on my MT.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi Jubu , still not working for me , probably user error I know

I think the problem is that you can compile it and we cant so we may have to flush some memeory location out before we have the update, maybe some sort of cache

--- 帖子 #556 ---
OK.. then here's the mq4 file... compile it yourself.. maby your right...

Peter please tell me if this worked for you.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hiya jubu

no still no luck

Illl haver a look at the prog tonight and see if anything jumps out

Dont worry , not a big issue

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Sorry no luck here either

--- 帖子 #559 ---
that is very strange... does it give any errors ? what do the experts and journal tabs say when you load it.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi jubu,

Same here.

No problem with the indicator, journal and expert tabs say everything has been loaded successfuly.

I can even see a red up arrow on EURUSD H1 (see attached chart).

So I assume everything works, but no other alerts have been triggered since then.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
In the 'experts' tab it loads RonnieSignals successfully and also loads Macd-with-ema as well (??)

In the 'journal' tab it loads both successfully too.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Looks like Im gonna delete pending UC? ITS GONE THE WRONG WAY

so has EU for the moment

--- 帖子 #563 ---
U/CHF pending order cancelled.  Candle has closed below 15 EMA.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Should it try and load both??

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I can see there should have been two more signals sience that red arrow.

pfff... I really don't know what to say... mine works fine and it gives alerts and everything. Try restarting the MT, or try to change the TF to M30 and then back. Or here, try this one i added two more buffers for visual price of entering the trade. It should display the arrow under the candle and an x up the arrow 10 pips higher then the candle high. If this one doesn't work either then i really don't know that to say... Something's definetly wrong but i don't know what.. and it's olso harder to find out what sence in my MT it works fine.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
anyone on sell for EU pair ? im on -70 pips.. Sweat! ehehe

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Nikita,

I'm also in with you.

As the saying goes................... It ain't over til the fat lady sings...

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Eventually it will sell after a brief pullback hope you can ensure the draw down.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
now its going back down to -30 pips... fingers crossed..

may the force be with us!

cheers

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi jubu,

Still no luck but I think I know what's wrong now that I have had a look at the source code.

Do you happen to use a 4 digits broker ?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
It seems the fat lady has sung.

No setup for the moment, waiting mode...

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Not the best of starts to the week................

--- 帖子 #573 ---
And worst : it's coming back down now.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
it might be a good idea to go down to M30, or M15 charts. Use same model, but reduce SLs and TPs based on ATR... ATR1620,G/U H1=.0027, M30=.0018. So, 18/27x100= SL, and TP at 67 pips on M30 chart. Buy on M30...

--- 帖子 #575 ---
yea..sad to say its a bad start..

but i guess GU is worth the wait since its on the way to be a setup candle..but of course, need to wait till the line crosses the macd red.. rite?

after double checking the chart on EU, it is coming down again.. DARN! in a way it just shoot up-touch my SL- and come back down..

anyway ronnie, just wanna ask your expert opinion, is it not advisable to trade on the first day of the trading week for your method? as in let the market run for 1 whole day first then only look for setups 2nd day onwards?

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Ultra long time lurker here. Subscribed to this very interesting thread, just checking I can post now

--- 帖子 #577 ---
pip

can you explain more re ATR to find alternative SL and TP on the other timeframes or somewhere I could read about it please

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I used a simple ratio, nothing more.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Yap... gj Khad, that was the problem. I use a 4 digit broker and i can see that many of you guys use a 5 digit broker. I've fixed that problem and made it so that it works on a five digit broker too (tested on Alpari). This version posted below v2.1 works on a 4 and 5 digit broker but if you have a 4 digit broker i would recommend you to get the v2.0 posted previously because that one works best on it. For example v2.1 will not work on a 3 digit pair from a 4 digit broker account and also it won't work on a 0 or 1 digit pair from a either a 5 or a 4 digit broker. I'm sorry if this sounds confusing but it's just how it is. Main poit is that it works on the main forex currencies, the ones that we trade.  Also for those who don't know, the 5th digit on the E/U (for example) does not represent 1 pip but the 4th does (just putting that out there).

Please tell me if you have any more issues with it. I will happily adress them.

Also have you seen the E/U move from yesterday. It's almost like it knew where our sls were, just grabbed them and went on it's way back... lol

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi Jubu,

Just attached the Indi and all working good. Excellent work! Much appreciated. Also you advised you are in process of developing the EA for this strategy. Could you please update us. Many Thanks!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Well the EA is in testing for best results. I'll let you know when i have something solid profitable. Till then you can use the other EA i have seen on this thread made by EACoder if you want. I'm gonna be making this EA so that it will work on 8(so far EU, GU, EG, UJ, AU, UC, EC, GJ) pairs all at once. So it's gonna detect signal from predetermined (written within the EA) pairs no matter what pair you put it on.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Nikita,

That's a tough question.

Looking back over the last month or so I'd say it's pretty much B/E.

Some Mondays are losers but then again some are winners.

Bottom line is, I've been trading this live for the last 5 months and it's been doing ok. If I see a setup then I'll put the trade on. I don't filter it with news announcements (apart from NFP) or S/R lines. My MM is very strict so as not to get too greedy or fear if I take a loss.

Sure, a few losses in a row does happen, but the bigger picture is that it is profitable.

A big plus point with this strategy is that screen time is minimal. I'm not the person that likes to stare at the screen all day.............. I look at the charts on the hour between 0600 & 1800 GMT and that's it.

If we could improve on this strategy through this thread then that would be great............

The forex market is a beast that will never be tamed, but to have an edge would be priceless.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi Jubu

Not that it makes much difference but I noticed your parameters are slightly wrong

MACDBUFF = iCustom(NULL,0,"Macd-with-EMA",30,75,1,12,4,i+1);

MACDMA = iCustom(NULL,0,"Macd-with-EMA",30,75,1,12,6,i+1);

should be

MACDBUFF = iCustom(NULL,0,"Macd-with-EMA",35,70,1,12,4,i+1);

MACDMA = iCustom(NULL,0,"Macd-with-EMA",35,70,1,12,6,i+1);

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I've been using this strategy for over a month now and it has been very useful for me so far. Since yesterday till today 7:30 am GMT+3 i made over $2000 and counting, mostly on jpy. Signals are pretty reliable (ofcourse not 100%) but good enough to go in without too much hesitation.

I change a system a little bit, like i apply macd both the default value which is 10,20,1,7 and one which is provided 35,70,1,12. That gives me a view of both short term price movement and long term movement.

Good thing is that you can use it on commodities aswell. I tried it and it works.

I recommend every new trader to try this, its totally worth it.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
thanks working now

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi Mustafa

Excellent news

Do you only enter when both macd's have their ema lines in the MACD coloured area or is it just for information , to see how good the trade can be

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Thanks for pointig that out Peter. I've reuploaded the indi v2.1 with the correct parameters in post #579. The other versions i couldn't update becouse i can't edit thoes posts anymore.

It didn't make much of a difference but who knows. I think we should have a special page or something for this strategy's indis and updates or EAs.

Also, i think that when we see trends like the GBPJPY one right now that don't touch the EMA15 we should switch to a lower TF like M30 or M15 for better results.

And also on EURUSD There is a reverse H&S. (H1 TF)

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Yeh I agree, its a shame to see those pips fly away on GBPJPY

We would have to use another limit though, not 10 pips above

maybe 5 or 3, i am not sure really and different tp sl as pipo was saying yesterday with the ATR

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Has anyone gone for UC Pending

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Pending buy stop order @0.92392

--- 帖子 #591 ---
plus the spread of (in my case 2.6) which equasl 0.92418 but not the end of the world is it +- 2 pips

ive deleted it now anyway

--- 帖子 #592 ---
on 1H TF?

--- 帖子 #593 ---
im on uc.. almost hitting my stop loss..the whole week managed a few trades..so far losses..few still pending..

--- 帖子 #594 ---
U/C ????

That pending order should have been cancelled

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I'm in GBPJPY since yesterday, currently -21 pips...

--- 帖子 #596 ---
my gj is alreadi stopped out..

why uc cancel? all the rules was in place when i took the order..

uc just stopped out..

erm.. wow.. 3 trades placed this week..all losing trades.. another 2 open trade.. any ideas?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
The candle after the one you entered at closed below the 15 EMA --> cancel the order...

--- 帖子 #598 ---
but if i remembered correctly..the order was placed before the candle touched the 50ema.. no ?

anyway i have 3 more trades on..au,usdcad and cadchf.. 1 profit 2 losing.. will wait till the outcome..

--- 帖子 #599 ---
The candle after the setup candle closed below the 15 EMA.

The 50 EMA has no relevance.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
oh..need your help..

as i wont be sitting at the computer all the time..

i remembered i read somewhere that theres an ea/script.. which can auto adjust your SL or even TP once it reached a certain price..

it is extremely handy when times like..when its +50 pips.. the new stop loss would be at Break even.. so anyone has that tool to auto set or auto adjust ??

thanks for your help..

p/s the uc that i placed...i think it was almost 6 candles away from the one u said touches the 50ema.. tat time there was also a setup candle and therefore i placed my order there.. but sad to say..reason it turned out as a loss was also because i was away from the pc and i didnt not change the stop loss to BE when it touches +50 pips..

--- 帖子 #601 ---
The G/J trade should still be open...

SL @ 132.23

--- 帖子 #602 ---
--> G/J trade reached TP

--> E/U trade still open

Am I correct ?

Correct....

So far this week:-

E/U -100

G/J +100

E/U still in play

--- 帖子 #604 ---
OK guys.. I will give you the EA that i promissed now.

Below you have the EA called "RonnieRott's by JuBu"(which goes in the experts directory) and two indicators upon which the EA depends named "Close" and "RonnieSignalsSilent"(they go in the indicators directory). The EA will not work without these indis. I have tested it for qite some time and it seems to work fine on both 4 and 5 digits brokers. The EA was designed specifficaly for the H1 TF and no matter which TF you will place it on it will work as if it was on H1. To use it you have to attach it to the chart/pair you want and turn the Expert Avisors button to ON and don't forget to check the "Allow Live Trading" box. You can attach it to as many pairs/charts as you want at the same time.

The EA works like this. It depends on the "RonnieSignalsSilent" indi to give the signal for entering a trade (pending order). It only enters 1 trade/pair so if there is allready an opened trade on the pair the ea will not place any orders. Sometimes certain pairs have a certain range between actuall price and pending order prices and because of that the ea will sometimes enter at a higher or lower (BUY or SELL) price than the High/Low+/-10pips as the strategy says(on pairs with bigger spread for expamle). The EA also delets the pendig order if the second candle from the setup one closes below/above(BUY/SELL) the EMA15. Also the ea dose everything only on open/close of candles or the start of the MT.

Modifiable Parameters:

You can modify these parameters in the expert properties when you attach it to the chart.

- Lots - 0.01 (by befault) amount of lots to enter a trade.

- UseExp - false (by default) this is like the on/off switch for using exponential lots. This will be explained below

- Percent - 1 (by default) the percentage of the free margin that you want to use as lot size.

- UseBreakEven - true (by default) This will be explained below.

- BreakEvenPips - 50 (by default) this is the amount of pips that the price has to exceed in order to break even.

- EMA - 15 (by default) this is the period of the Exponential Moving Average used by the EA. I added this parameter because i have a hunch that 13 or lower (for ex.) is better for not missing other profitable trades. But it's just a hunch, i haven't tested anything yet.

Options

- The EA has a Break Even system set to 50 pips and turned ON by default, you can also turn it off or modify the pips number at which you want it to break even. It has a fixed SL and TP at 100 each witch cannot be modified in the ea, only manually. It will break even only if the candle closes above/below(BUY/SELL) the set number of pips(i.e. 50).

- It also has a "Use Exponential Lots" option which is turned OFF by default. What this means is that if you turn it on by setting the "UseExp" parameter to true it will use a percentage of your free margin as a number of lots to enter the trades. The percentage is set by default to 1% in the ea but you can modify it. If this option is OFF(false) it will use the "Lots" parameter which is set to 0.01 by dafault.

Indis:

- RonnieSignalsSilent is the same as the previuos "RonnieSignals v2.1" only without the alerts and mail sendig options because we don't want to be annoyed by a lot of alerts and e-mails.

- The Close indicator is a simple indi that just tells the Close price. I used it in this EA because I want the EA to be specifically for the H1 TF.

Good Pairs

I have backtested this ea on all the pairs offered by my A.M. broker and these are the only ones that i found profitable : EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EURGBP, USD/JPY, USD/CHF(poor), NZDCHF, GBP/JPY.

You can backtest it yourself with StrategyTester if you want.

Congrats.. now you can just sit back and relax while the ea does everything. I hope it works for all of you.

If you have any problems with it or find any bugs please tell me.

Wow thanks Jubu

Something to play with for the weekend

Next week we will be millionaires Yipeeee

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi Jubu, great work! Thanks a lot!

Btw there was an EA by EA Coder ITA for some time! Where are the difference between the two EA's ? And does anybody has some experience by trading with the former EA ?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Well i wouldn't go that far... but who knows.. maby one day.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi jubu,

I've backtested your EA from 2009 until now on EURUSD, see the result attached (modeling quality: 90%).

Did you get similar results for EURUSD ?

Khad

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Excellent work Jubu.

Will put it onto demo and compare with forthcomng live trades..

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Well actually i didn't test it that far back. just 2010... and thoes were the pairs that gave a positive result

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Not the best of weeks, with only 3 setups.

E/U -100

G/J +100

E/U -100

So overall for week being -100.

Overall for March alot healthier at +500

I was hoping that yesterdays E/U was going to get back to B/E this morning so I could have manually closed it before NFP.

It was about -50 just before the news came out so I left it, and the rest is history.

Have a good weekend all.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I also had a setup on g/j today (see attached screenshot).

Wasn't it valid ?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Khad,

Looks a good setup but, I personally don't place trades on NFP day.

If I have a trade already on from previous then I close it if in profit or B/E.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Ok I understand. I wouldn't have placed a e/u trade on NFP day, but as it was on g/j I gave it a shot. It worked but maybe I was lucky on this one.

Thanks for the explanation.

e/u as retraced all the way back...

Khad

--- 帖子 #615 ---
roonie... may i ask..

saw ur post u said march u had +500 pips (i guess it means 5 winning trades of 100 pips each)

do u have a summary on how many trades u have placed for the whole march which ended with 500 pips profit ?

wanna gauge the success rate of this system..

sorry to ask u such direct question..because i had quite a number of losses and i hope u can enlighten me with your exact trade numbers and ur success rate..

thanks again

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Nikita,

It meant that I had 5 more winning trades than losing ones.

All my trades are logged in a book at work so, tomorrow I'll list them all for March....

--- 帖子 #617 ---

Hi Jubu

Is there any chance you could make the TP and SL user inputtable

I like to play with different exit strategies

Ta

Peter

--- 帖子 #620 ---
roonie..thanks for your statements.. it is reassuring..

however.. remember the other time i asked you about is it not so wise to trade on the 1st day ??

coincidentally i noticed that..most of your losses  or not so profitable trades come from the 1st day of trading..

for example.. 7,14,21,28

what do you think ??

--- 帖子 #621 ---
It's something that could be worth monitoring....

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Well you could do that manually, change the sl and tp. Maby in the next update i'll make them custom.

There is a pendig on E/U at 1.4251 am i correct ronnie ? Does this one hold cause it looks kind of dangerous. Did you take it ?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Well its more for the backtesting  with the strategy tester , than online

I cant do that manually really

--- 帖子 #624 ---
OK.. i'll make it more modifiable this week, i'll add the custom sl and tp, and make it work on any tf. I'll embed the ronniesignals conditions directly into it so that it wown't depend on any indicators anymore and so that you will be able to modify the ema15 to ema12(e.g.) or any other ema period for testing.

Also i did some backtesting of my own and found that ema12 is a bit more profitable than ema15. I backtested it with ema 10,11,12,13,14 and 15 on the 7 pairs that i use. Please look into that Ronnie and tell me what you think.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hello everyone,

I hope you will all find success with this system.

Ronnie, I have a question about consecutives signals. Please have a look at the screenshot attached. A signal occured and I placed my stop order accordingly. The next candle also gives a signal, what should I do ? Move my stop order according to that new signal or simply do nothing ?

Thanks for your input.

Khad

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi jubu,

Thank you for you hard work.

May I suggest another feature to include in your next update (this shouldn't be too complicated to add) ?

Ronnie wrote he usually only looks for trade setups between the hours of 0600 to 1800 GMT. However, the expert advisor trades every setup. It's ok for live trading, because you can turn it on/off but for backtesting, it would be neat if you included a "time window" parameter. Something like DontTradeBefore and DontTradeAfter.

What do you think ?

Regards,

Khad

--- 帖子 #627 ---
OK... good thinking.. i'll add that too, if you think of something else don't hasitate to tell me..

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Has everyone taken that good signal on GBPUSD

If it breaks 1.61500 its a good chance it will go up

--- 帖子 #629 ---
I'm in...

There was a signal on GBP/JPY but it was invalidated (candle closed right under the 15 EMA) so I didn't take it. Anyone did ?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
EURUSD , ok but beware as it is hitting resistance

see 220311

Could bounce down again

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Yes, a valid setup candle.

But then price closed below 15EMA so order cancelled

--- 帖子 #632 ---
If it means getting in on the trade at a better price (In this case a lower entry) I would adjust my pending order

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Jubu,

The EA seems to be doing all the right things.

One question though:-

The distance between the 15 EMA and the high/low of the setup candle.  Is this parameter within the EA??  i.e Max 50.

The reason for the question is that I use different figures for different pairings.

E/U & G/U     Max 50

U/CHF & G/J  Max 30.

Could this be adjusted in the parameters??

Regards

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hello, I have been following thread for some time and trading manually.  I really like the trading system and just added new EA last Friday.  I have received some signals no trades yet, is this correct?  Thanks

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Yes that parameter is within the ea, actually it is within the inicator and it's set to 50, you can not change it yet but when i will update it I will make this parameter custom too. I will probably update it tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Jubu,

You're a star....................

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi Meanpips,

Welcome to the thread...

I'm running the EA on demo at the mo so I can compare it to the manual method.

All seems to be working ok.  Today 2 trades have been placed, those being buys on G/U & E/U.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
jubu..just started ur ea..

one quick questions..

will your ea have those magic numbers? or unique numbers ?

another question is.. will the ea mess up wit my manual trading orders within the same pair?

example..

EU pair..  ea placed an order.. at the same time i want to place my own manual order.. will your ea change or adjust my manual orders ??

--- 帖子 #639 ---
wow...first live trade on G/U and it's winner, +100 pips.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
yes.. currently it will mess all other orders on the same pair, and by mess up i mean break even if the price goes higher than 50pips and closes above. Also it will not place the order of a signal if there's currently an opened order on that pair. It does not work with magic numbers. I'll look into that and see what i can do about it for the next update.

Also allready this week we have two winners.

G/U +100

G/J +100

E/U -52 currently but not closed

--- 帖子 #641 ---
jubu

GJ was not counted because the setup candle was not valid as the next candle went down the ema15 before hitting the buy stop right?

so it should be just EU and GU right ?

--- 帖子 #642 ---
thanks for your wonderful cooperation jubu !

http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/6985/closey.gif

why do i get false signals on 15 ema close as per 2 & 3. it told to short whereas candles closed above 15 ema close.

using r v 2.1 signal

regards

rishi

--- 帖子 #643 ---
It was a valid setup.

The setup candle was the one that opened at 1200 GMT yesterday.

The high was 135.72.  The next candle then triggered the buy.

The MACD MA was close to making it a no trade but at the close of the setup candle it was just in.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Thoes are not false signals. They are normal signals. The indicator doesn't take into account if the next candle closes above or below EMA15, only the EA dose. If you had read carefully the posts for the indis you would have known that.

The G/J pending order was placed at 13:00 at 135.86 and got triggered at 13:51. It was placed automatically by the EA.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Interesting trading system ..  Enjoy trading and make money ))) !!!

--- 帖子 #646 ---
forgive me if im wrong..

the 1st setup was alreadi cancelled by the next candle..

and the 2nd setup was also cancelled by the next candle..

so its no longer valid right ??

sorry for askin too much kays

--- 帖子 #647 ---
The setup candle is the one after the 2nd arrow...... It closed just above the 15 EMA.  The next candle then activated the trade

--- 帖子 #648 ---
oh..so meaning the indicator was wrong ??

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi Ronnie, The ea pick up two successful trades last night on the E/U and GBP/U

what is the desired settings so far for take profit.  I set my take profit for 20 pips, but it looks like I can set it higher and still be ok.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Well actually the candle after the 2nd arrow wasn't a setup candle because of the macd.

The indicator can never be "wrong" unless it gets wrong info from the server or another tehnical error occures that blocks it's capacity to run, in which case the hole MT is "wrong", other indicators too.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi Meanpips,

I personally run this system/strategy on a S/L 100, T/P 100 & go to B/E when +50 for the 1 HR T/F.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Ok,

Here's how I see yesterdays trade, see chart below.

The candle (circled) is my setup candle.

The close is above the 15 EMA (See data window on left)

Looking down to the MACD, the MA looks very close to being outside the coloured area.

If you then look in the data window (on the left) you will see that the MA value is less than the MACD value........... So this means that the MA on the MACD is within the coloured area.

The high of the candle is less than 30 pips from the 15 EMA.

Pending order is set 10 pips above the high of setup candle.

The next candle then triggers the buy (just)

Hope this clarifies.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Yes actually you're right sorry for that. I actually took that trade myself yesterday and won it. But i got a clear signal from the indi and the ea opened the order. Maby nikita got false values on the charts from the feed and that's why it didn't work. This happends sometimes on demo accounts otherwise it should have signaled. Their feed is not as clear as the live ones.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
hi

thanx for your system.

poor engilsh .sorry.

if we enter when candel close under or above movings. and 15 moving in between channel .is true enter?

in this case we have good enter.

roonie.. thanks for your clarifaction..

jubu yea.thanks for your explanation too.. because at the time i was scratching my head on where was the candles.. hehe..

anyway good start to the week.

EU is also on the verge of TP..

3 wins out of 3 this week ? great

is there a set up candle in usdchf?? i see tat the setup candle was 3 candles back..and now there is another setup candle forming..

but its not shown in jubu's incidator..

--- 帖子 #656 ---
The current candle could be a setup one.

The candle a short while ago was valid but outside my trading time

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi Ronnie,

Isn't the 15 EMA too close to the 50 EMA ? If I remember well, you want about 6 pips between the two EMAs (and jubu's indicator didn't signal anything).

Now maybe 6 pips is not as rigid as this, it could be more or less, depending on other factors... Can you please enlighten me ?

Thanks,

Khad

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Yes that's why it didn't signal.. that condition wasn't met. The EMA15 was too close to EMA50

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Well spotted....

The 7.00 GMT candle was ok (6.4 pip difference)

The earler candle was not valid

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Trades so far this week:-

04/04    G/U +100

04/04    E/U still in play, currently +48.  SL @ BE

04/04    G/J +100

--- 帖子 #661 ---
well jubu, due to my hectic routine, i surely didn't go through indicator notes & thanks for pointing out what you mentioned.

loaded your EA ... looks great !

i wish a later version at some point would have :-

1) semi-auto feature - user's discretion to trade manually or auto

2) all signals with closes pointing arrows on chart .. this makes life easy for busy bees, when EA not live, even then it must show signals of present & past.

3) customizable tp & sl (as someone has suggested) & trailing SL

4) max pips distance from candle high or low from 15 ema - customizable (ronnie)

5) max pips distance of 15 ema from 50 ema or angle of 15 ema from 50 ema- got this idea from THE DANCE (maybe considering ema angle or something so that you don't have to measure angle manually - filter of some poor trades)

6) choice between displaying arrows, crosses, fractals, round etc shapes,

attached an indicator 2ma crossover to see if results could be replicated.

7) digits _ 5 _ account (true .....or false for default 4 digits)

8) only chart symbol (works with current chart only)

9)  alarm with notifications -  sound, pop or email

i know - too many ,but maybe some food for thought !

regards

.Hawk.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hello,

Is this a valid setup ? If so, there must be an issue with the indicator as it hasn't given any signal. If not, why ?

Thanks,

Khad

--- 帖子 #663 ---
maybe distance from candle high/low to 15 ema issue

regards

.Hawk.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Looks good to me.  Pending order @ 139.007

candle closed below 15 ema !

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hawk,

Is that a 15 EMA??

Looks totally different to my chart.

Will post a chart shortly

--- 帖子 #667 ---
G/J 06 Apr

--- 帖子 #668 ---
indeed a 15 ema, little thicker

my apologies to khad ... you were correct candle had closed above 15 ema...

woof, too much workload, completely forgot i use heikin ashi candles & usual candle did close above 15 ema .. but i am still good with HA as saves from bad signals & i don't care if few pips are lost in using HA !

for me that candle closed below 15 ema & saved from a possible poor trade !

edit :- note to ronnie : just saw your chart after posting this, you are bang on !

regards

.Hawk.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Well most of what you listed up above i already made and am testing for bugs before releasing the update. But there are some questions :

1) I don't really understand what you mean by semi auto. Please expain.

2) All signals already have arrows and by "closes" do you mean order closes or what ? The arrows and x's are made by the indicator, not the ea. I'll update the indicator along with the ea too but the "closes" part i don't get. It will be more costumizable.

3) Already done

4) Alreay done

5) Already done (max distance, not angle thingy)

6) I'll consider it for the indicator.

7) Probably will make, but the 5 digit ea/indi works with 4 digit accounts too, just not with 3 digit pairs.

8) That's how it is

9) The indi already has that.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hi Ronnie,

Hey has this ever been tested on the 4HR or Daily time frame?

--- 帖子 #671 ---
jubu..i think one of the main feature to add in ..probably a magic number..so that it doesnt mess up wit our own manual trades from the same pair.. agree ?

and perhaps a specific time to place trades as how roonie 'works' everyday.. but at the same time it will still modify the trades when necessary ie. modify SL to BE when +50 anytime of the day

--- 帖子 #672 ---
The ea already has a B/E when +50 any time of the day. The magic number and interval option will be added.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hi Meanpips.

I haven't looked at those T/F's............... But I guess it could be worth looking at.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Jubu,

With ref to the EA.

Could the entry price (i.e 10 pips above/below the high/low) be adjustable by the user so it makes it more flexible for use on different TF's??

When using on a lower TF (i.e 15M) an entry of 2-3 pips above/below the high/low would be more beneficial.

Regards

NEW   Pending Sort UC 0.9167 but GMT 5.00 so Bit early in the day for ronnie but the trend is the right way , so I will take it

OLD   GJ closed at BE- "all's well that ends well"

UPDATE this setup is still valid at 6 GMT  - any takers???

--- 帖子 #676 ---
peter..

im taking UC trade..am waiting to be filled.

seems like plenty of high impact news are coming out today..

should we rest for today ?

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hello,

GJ closed at BE too. Pending order placed for UC @ 0.91670.

Regards,

Khad

--- 帖子 #678 ---
I think the order should be filled meanwhile  I am into that trade too ... Let's get ready for the news ...

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Maybe we should , Unfortunately my childsh excitement makes me want to play

One thing I always do is make sure I am going with the higher TF trends

UC has a Donwtrend on W1,D1,H4 And H1 so the force is with us.

I have been playing this with M1 and it works remarkably well

I have been treating the 50 ema channel like a vegas signal , buying when it goes above selling when it goes below and using the lower 50 ema  as the SL level on a buy and vice versa

NOTE just a way to pass the time whilst waiting for the next  ronnie signal on the 1hour

is anyone finding FF a bit slow at the moment UPDATE,  no it was not FF it was cos last time i rebooted was about a year ago  LOL

It works really well at session opens

you should try it

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Jubu

one last request from me

Can we have a choice of trading i.e.

Only longs or only shorts or obviously both

ie

extern longtradeonly  = true;

extern shorttradeonly = true;

if both false then it trades both ways

its just I like only trading with the trend of higher TFs
keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hello Peter,

I think it's a built-in feature of mt4.

See the EA's properties (attached screenshot).

"I usually only look for trade setups between the hours of 0600 to 1800 GMT"

London time..... All year round

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi guys,

I just finished reading all posts on the thread. Thanks ronnie for sharing it.

Jubu, I added your ea and when I attached it to the chart it does not show a smiley face, instead it shows an X....is this ok?...sorry if my queston is a dumb one...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Make sure your EA's are enabled.

Go to "tools" "options" "expert advisors" and ensure the right boxes are ticked............

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Below you will find the updated versions of the EA and Indicator. Hope no bugs were left.

EA - update info

Almost every parameter of the EA is now modifiable so you can play and backtest with it as much and freely as you want. It can be tested on any TF. The EA does not need the indicators "RonnieSignalsSilent" and "Close" any more. But it still needs the Macd-with-EMA.mq4 indicator.

Here's a list of added and modifiable parameters:

EMA = 15;

HIGHEMA = 50;

LOWEMA = 50;

MacdFastEMA = 35;

MacdSlowEMA = 70;

SignalEMA=1;

MAofSignal=12;

StopLoss = 100;

TakeProfit = 100;

/---------------

DistanceEHL = 50;// Max. distance between EMA15 and HIGH/LOW of the setup candleHIGH/LOW
DistanceHE = 6; // Min. distance between HighEMA and EMA15(for LONG trades).
DistanceLE = 6; // Min. distance between LowEMA and EMA15(for SHORT trades).
DistanceOfOrder = 10; // Distance between High/Low(Buy/Sell) and pending order price.

Added interval of Hours with modifiable parameters.
UseInterval = false; // Set to true to work
FromHour = 6;
ToHour = 18;
Important note : The first parameter "FromHour" must always be less or equal to the second parameter "ToHour";

Added trailing stop
UseTrailingStop = false;
TrailingStop = 50;
Note : If you choose to use the trailing stop then the break even will not work.

Added MaxAddedDistance as an error compensator.
MaxAddedDistance = 11; // This parameter represents the maximum allowed number of pips from the current, normal order price in case of an error(e.g. the price is too close to the pending order opening price due to a big spread or net crash... etc. but the order still can be placed at a bigger price. Then it will be placed at the best price allowed but it if doesn't go past the MaxAddedDistance, in this case 11 pips from the normal opening price of an order, which is 10 pips above/below high/low).

Added Magic Number.

Now the EA will not mess with any other orders you have on any more.

Changed Break Even

Now it breaks even immediately as the price is reached and not only if it closes above it.

Indi - update info

The indi wasn't changed that much. I just made it more modifiable.

Here's what i did:

EMA = 15;

HIGHEMA = 50;

LOWEMA = 50;

MacdFastEMA = 35;

MacdSlowEMA = 70;

SignalEMA=1;

MAofSignal=12;

/---------------
DistanceEHL = 50;// Max. distance between EMA15 and HIGH/LOW of the setup candleHIGH/LOW
DistanceHE = 6; // Min. distance between HighEMA and EMA15(for LONG signals).
DistanceLE = 6; // Min. distance between LowEMA and EMA15(for SHORT signals).
DistanceOfOrder = 10; // Distance between High/Low(Buy/Sell) and pending order price for x marks the spot.

OK.. now you will be able to play with them and test this strategy however you want. Please do as many backtests as posible and if you find anything good, or anything that would improve the profitability of this strategy don't forget to share it with us.

If you want to play with the source code pm me.

Copied in the indi folder so far.

There is noch mq4 file inside only ex4

RonnieSignals v2.0 and 2.1 are in the list and ok.

Thanks for your help. Sorry for my bad english

Hi Ronnie,

I missed the G/U setup from 06/04 and I can't seem to find it on the chart ? Would you mind detailing the setup ?

Thanks,

Khad

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Yeh me too , I can't see that setup

Also another thing, according to the rules shouldn't the candle arrowed be a setup candle

Dont worry its not the four we use it's GBPAUD, its just that with ronnierot indi I would thought there would be an signal here aswell

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hello Peter,

Check the distance between the 15EMA and the 50EMA (must be more than 6pips) and check the distance between the high of the candle and the 15 EMA (must be less than 50 pips).

Khad

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Will try and post chart later, but for info it was the 10AM London time candle

Candle closed @ 1.63048....

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Yep the distance was 10 pips and I think you mean the distance between the low of the setup candle and the 15 ema (it was a sell setup) which is less than 50 and actually even less than 30

Arhah I think I may know the problem though, the spread may take it to less than 6 pips , thanks Khad

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Yes, my mistake, I meant the low of the setup candle.

jubu's indicator is pretty robust so if it hasn't shown any signal I think you can safely trust it.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
ARh I see it ronnie , I will post it for you

dunno how I missed that

it was the first signal shown here, take no notice of the label

Right I think I have just realized what is happening , As the spread fluctuates then  if you load up the indi on the chart say at 8.00 am and the spread is wide then is might not show it up on the chart compared to if you load it up at say 9.00 where the spread could be a bit different

Hence some people see the signal and some dont

Cos I sure the first time I looked at the chart the signal was not there but when i reloaded it was

eu trade has reached 100tp !

im letting it run on trail stop

hope the uc hits tp too

roonie i did not take the other trades as i was thinking of passing the 1st day trades for the week..

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I think it's swings and roundabouts whether to trade this on Mondays.

Monday this week was +300, last week -100 & the week before +100.

Me personally, I trade this religously 6.00 - 18.00 (London time) 5 days a week...... Except NFP days.

U/CHF setup possibly approaching

I'm still in...

Have you been out ?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
roonie..want to ask you do u take trades on friday?

or to be precise, maybe half the day is gone, do u take it, and if u do, do u close it before the week ends or let it run til the next week ?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
I'm still in yesterdays trade.

But if a setup comes along and the previous trade is at B/E then I will jump in on another one.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I do take trades on Fridays.

However, mid afternoon I will review all open positions.  Those showing good profit I will close.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Oh I see. Good to know that. Thanks.

Broker time

The signal didn't apper there because the high of the candle was bigger than the low ema50.

Here are my trades this week :

G/U +100; 04/04; 1100 GMT

E/U +100; 04/04; 1300 GMT

G/J +100; 04/04; 1300 GMT

G/U +100; 06/04; 1100 GMT

G/J -100; 06/04 (mine didn't break even) placed @ 1100, triggered @ 15:25 GMT @ price 139.18

U/J -6; 06/04; 1100 GMT (not closed)

U/C +37; placed @ 20:00, 06/04 and triggered @ 07:30 - 07/04, currently @ B/E not closed yet

Also i think that for G/J trades the sl and tp should be @ 200 because of the big volatility of the pair

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Hi jubu,

I forgot to say thank you for your work. Really good job.

High five!

Hi Ronnie this looks like good system

The results quoted was it manually or with the EA

Thank you

Wil test the system from next week

However, I will be putting Jubu's updated EA onto demo for next week to compare it with future manual trades.

USDCHF Trade triggered by Jubu EA .9112

--- 帖子 #718 ---
USDCHF SHORT  +50

--- 帖子 #719 ---
hi Ronnie, firstly many thanks for putting up this cool strategy on this great forum. I did two trades and the latest one on USD/CHF fetched me 60+ pips. There is one thing which is not clear though. Your rules mention that stop or cut loss should be 100 pips but from where should i calculate this 100 pips.

1) 100 pips from the entry price of the trade?

2) 100 pips from the low/high of the setup candle?

3) 100 pips from the 15 EMA?

Could you please throw some light on this please? .... Once again thanks for this cool system....

--- 帖子 #720 ---
usdchf short - new trade

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Kool,

Welcome to the thread.

I use a 100 SL & 100 TP from entry price. When (if) price then goes to +50 I move the SL to B/E.

Hope this clarifies.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
If anyone is having success with other pairings please feel free to post them.

Don't feel that this thread is only for the 4 pairings that I trade.

Well, that's me done for the week.

Will post this weeks results either over the weekend or early next week.

Have a good weekend.....

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi,

I have just read the first 14 pages, a long way still to go, and this is very near to a system I have been developing myself.  Havig had a look and one of th ecomments was "when its near" is a bit subjective.  Could I suggest using envelopes for the 15SMA at a small percentage say 0.10%.  This gives some flexibility.  Only an idea.  Thanks for a great thread.  I hope to finish the next 50 odd pages soon.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Please forgive my hastiness. I wish I could, but I really don't have the time to read all the pages of this thread. I read first few pages and get the main idea. My question is, are there any major changes from the first few pages that have improved the method?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi Steve,

I'm thinking that you are on about where the MACD MA is in relation to MACD.

The way that I trade it is, as long as the MACD MA is within the coloured then it's ok.

The way I ascertain this, when it looks quite close, is to have the data window visible so as to give exact readings for the relationship between the MACD and the MACD MA.

Hope this helps....

--- 帖子 #726 ---
It's probably worth reading the whole thread.  Alot of constructive comments have been made regarding various peoples comfort zones with this strategy.......  Everyone has a different view, especially regarding SL, TP & TS.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Excellent point. It may take awhile since it's hard for me to read alot in one sitting just due to so many things going on, but I will go through the thread entirely and see what everyone has said or added to it. Hope I didn't come across as someone just looking to get a freebie, I personally don't like to that, but was just wondering if anything major had changed from the beginning.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Nothing much has changed at all.

I trade it as per the original posts, and always will.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
thanks mate .... that indeed clarifies my question.... wish you happy trades ahead !!  :-)

--- 帖子 #730 ---
I agreee with Ronnie.... I shall too strictly stick to the rules... bending the rules is okay but breaking it does not make sense. its a nice strategy and I did two profitable trades and in money already in the third trade... i have also backtested it for like 3 weeks and so far the results are okay.

will continue using it  !!

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Ronnie... you mentioned in one of the post earlier, that you tend to look for setups between 06:00 hrs and 18:00 hrs GMT ..... could you please explain why do you tend to trade between these hours ?

1. is it because trading outside this time window caused more trades to trigger your stop loss ?

2. is it because you find more trade setups during the above mentioned time period?

say for instance, if we find a setup meeting all the rules but outside 06:00 - 18:00 GMT, can we still take this trade ? if we took the trade then what would be the negative factor ?

you kind explanation will be appreciated ...

--- 帖子 #732 ---
There are 2 reasons for this:-

1.  Before 06.00 is too early for me (I like my sleep)

2.  After 18.00 is my time to chill with a beer.

There are no other factors for these times.  I just class 06.00 - 18.00 as

my workng day.

And just to clarify, 06.00 - 18.00 London time (all year round)

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Ronnie do you have any opened trades over this weekend ?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Ok, so here's this weeks trades:-

04/04    G/U    +100

04/04    E/U    +100

04/04    G/J    +100

06/04    G/J      B/E

06/04    G/U    +100

07/04    U/CHF +100

08/04    U/CHF Still in play, currently +45. SL @ B/E

08/04    G/U    Still in play, currently -2.

A hell of a week.

So with the 2 open trades the worst result for the week will be +400, and the best we can expect is +700.

I carried on trading this week when I normally wouldn't have done (must be the gambler in me)

For those who are reading this thread for the first time, this week has been exceptional.  Please don't think that every week is like this.

You DO get losing weeks.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
okay thanks .... cheers !!

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Thanks. I was thinking of switching to live but i wanted to be in line with your trades for comparison cause i will trade non stop over the week with the EA and at the end we would compare results. But there's no rush, i'll start next week according to my original plan. Up till now i traded from about 7am to 10pm.

If i see correctly, the 07/04    U/CHF did not reach 100 pips and is at +78 currently on my account. How is divergence possible ?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Entry @ 0.9167.

Yesterdays low was 0.9057

The setup candle was at 05.00.  That candle was still valid when I got on it at 06.00

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Something's not right here.

Here's a pic

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Jubu,

Your broker closed an hour earlier than mine.

Mine hit TP on my brokers last candle. The low of my last candle was 0.90577

--- 帖子 #740 ---
OK.. i thought this was a broker issue. But could you post a print screen still, I'm just curious to compare them if there's no trouble. Thanks and i apologize for the inconvenience.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
U/CHF

--- 帖子 #742 ---
OK.. thanks. I've noticed that you took the 2nd u/c trade during the 1st one. I thought that we had to wait for the first to be finished and then take the second. Anyway.. I'm out. Have a great weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I will always take a second trade as long as the first one's SL is at B/E

Jubu, saying that, is this something that could be incorporated into the EA as a selectable option??

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi Ronnie, thanks for this simple system and congrats for the last week result. Really great.

I've been playing with EMAs (13, 34 on H1 preferably) for long time, but this system seems to fit my needs very well.

I like I can use it as a good filter of choppy market and it's perfect for an entry whan the market is trending.

First of all I look at important S/R zones, TLs, channels etc., then I look for an entry. I choose SL and TP accordingly to the stuff above, I don't use fixed ones like you (100pips). It's up to everybody.

First trade I took by using your system was yesterday on USDCHF, but unfortunatelly I put SL 30pips only, so my SL was hit before the price went my way. TP was 60 pips aprox and would be hit then.

My trade:

Entry in blue rectangel area
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I was waiting until the S/R zone (red line) and the TL was broken and retested before the entry.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Looking forward to see further results!

Have a nice weekend

Welcome....................

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Yes it is.  I didn't know that till now.  I am going to implement that in the next update of the ea.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
jubu,

Does your ea enter a trade on the close of a candle only or does it enter as soon as price breaks the "DistanceOfOrder" parameter? Thanks, and great work.   Matt

--- 帖子 #748 ---
The ea places a pending order at the DistanceOfOrder parameter price when a signal appears, which is at a candle close.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
jubu ... could i have a RonnieSignals indicator version which considers heikin ashi closes of candles only ...

heikin ashi candle closes (price) instead of usual closes on 1 hr with this strategy has given me less & more reliable signals. Kindly spot yellow check signs on above/below heikin ashi bars.

following are few examples :

Sorry but i am not familiar with that indicator. Please post it.

I see on your charts that cu checked only the candle signals that are color relevant to the specific trend. The color of the candles don't mater in this strategy and from what i see on those charts of yours it wouldn't make much of a difference.

time is based on our own system time or broker time ?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
looks like we could have a potential short trade coming up for USD/JPY .... but for that the price needs to come back and kiss the 15 EMA...

i know USD/JPY is not one of Ronnie's pairings but want to give it a try if it gives a good setup.  :-)

"RULE 1. The MACD has to be the right colour for the direction of the trade"

I´m not sure I understand that rule. Is it green=buy orders allowed, and red=sell orders allowed?

or is it rising=light green and light red=buy allowed, dark green+dark red =falling, sell allowed

--- 帖子 #766 ---
jubu, one question about canselling pending order. I started up my EA yestarday, today GMT 09.00 (with close of GMT 08.00 candle) it placed a pending EU buy order.

The GMT 11.00 candle closed below EMA 15.

Shouldnt EA has removed the pending order? It did not, I removed it manually.

Just wont to understand.

The EA has removed several UC pending orders today.

Bets wishes

Elovv

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Green for buy & red for sell.

Light or dark colours makes no difference

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Yes, i had that trade myself and saw that it didn't delete it on the first candle below the ema. It deleted it on the second. That was wierd cause i can't really explain why. I personally thought it was because it must have missed the end of the candle on my charts somehow but being given that the same thing happened on yours... i don't know. The code is good, it's not bugged from that point of view. The deleting order function is programmed to be called only at candle ends, that keeps it from deleting the orders too early. I'll look into it further more. Thanks for the heads up.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Thanks for clarifying Yuor EA. I guess Your order whas closed on the GMT 12.00 candle, the second below EMA 15. Mine whas not closed att all, closed manuall GMT 14.30

Hello,

Ronnie, could you provide me with some statistics regarding your trading history ? One number I would like to know is the maximum/average consecutive losses/wins you had since you started trading this system.

You wrote in post #13 :

What do you mean by "for ages" ? Months ? Years ?

Thanks in advance,

USDCHF trade taken By Jubu EA enter at .9013 .hope for the best.

Ok, the 2 open trades from last week have now closed.

Those being:-

08/04 U/CHF +100

08/04 G/U -100

So last weeks total pip count was +500 (If only every week was like that)

Nothing for me so far this week. A couple of pending orders went on yesterday but were then cancelled as price went the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Hi Khad,

Like I said I've been trading it live since Nov 10 but monitored it for 6 months before that.

If I can remember rightly the most losses in a row has been 3, and wins in a row about 6.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Thank you very much Ronnie.

Straight from the start I will  admit now to dipping in and out as its a hell of a job to read everything.  I have a similar strategy which I arrived at before I read this thread and I like both.  There was a comment below about being a gambler which I would like to comment on.  I suppose the definition of a gambler is someone who places a bet on an unknown outcome, so we are all gamblers.  However, I have recently adjusted my own trading style to soften this.   I try to build a position based on the longer term trend using the waves of the lower tf's to enter.  I am being succesful at the moment and this might help others with their trading.   I am not suggesting any modifications just an input on trading risk and style.

quote=ronnierott;4533012]Ok, so here's this weeks trades:-

04/04 G/U +100

04/04 E/U +100

04/04 G/J +100

06/04 G/J B/E

06/04 G/U +100

07/04 U/CHF +100

08/04 U/CHF Still in play, currently +45. SL @ B/E

08/04 G/U Still in play, currently -2.

A hell of a week.

So with the 2 open trades the worst result for the week will be +400, and the best we can expect is +700.

I carried on trading this week when I normally wouldn't have done (must be the gambler in me)

If a trade is +50 pips and SL=BE, the rules says we can take one more trade on that pair.

Does jubus EA take that trade?

Elovv,

I think Jubu is going to incorporate that function on his next update.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
the Moving average of MACD for GBP/USD has now entered in the coloured (red) zone, 15 EMA is nicely more than 6-8 pips away from the 50 EMA... If the prices manage to touch the 15 EMA then it would be a potential good setup for short ....

GBP had anyways gone way too high and it could really do with some re-tracement !!!

Am I correct:

Bounce is exactly that, only the wick tocuching the MA. Reversal is 2 consecutive candles closing below then above for a long trade setup.  I am just adding an alert to my existing system to see how it helps me.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hi guys. Just want to verify with you all.. As I was away for almost 2 days I couldn't do any manual trades and I left jubu ea to run the show. But the thing is since the market was open this week I saw 3 trades being opened but not filled and got cancelled by the ea. However I saw someone in the thread mentioning gj and uc pair was open n running at the moment. I don see any trades being taken by jubu. So is the ea having problems or those who mentioned that they open position is through manual method or trying out their own way...sorry that i won't be active in this thread at least until tomorrow. Cheers all

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Both the GBPJPY and USDCHF were opened by the EA on my platform and also the USDJPY,  took them all off manually in profit .  Opened now is the GBPUSD . Hope this helps you

Hi jubu!

"

Entry is then 10 pips above/below the high/low of the setup candle. (Add spread for long trades)"

Is it possible to add spread for long trades on Your next update?

Best wishes

Elovv

--- 帖子 #796 ---
You can manually add the spread by modifying the DistanceOFOrder parameter on that certain pair.

The ea has started 5 trades for me this week. Two broke even and 3 are currently opened. Actually 3 would have broke even if i kept the ea running over the night but i didn't. You must be doing something wrong or i don't know. You can compare the ea with the indicator and see where is should have enterd and when it closed or watch the journal and experts tab for errors. Hope you are using the v2 of the ea.

I already implemented that for the next ea update.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Jubu

If you are getting the error that the trade context is busy (I had a pending that did not delete today cos of it)

The reason being , too many things trying to access the server at one time

You can try adding this , it will sort out the deadlock

while(IsTradeContextBusy()) Sleep(100);

RefreshRates();

That should remedy the problem.

It will just wait until available, then you can carry on processing

jubu im using your v2.. however it has placed 3 pending orders but were cancelled 1 hour after the pending order was placed..  its eu buy,gu sell, gu sell..

however i have changed your distance ehl to roonie's criteria.. 50 for gu and eu 30 for gj uc.. you changed tat too and you have 5 trades?

also ive set the time from 6-18 as how ronnie trades.. even i am looking back the charts from 2 days back..i don see any trades needed to be place in for gu as you mentioned.

as  you mentioned v2 u can just put macd with ema is enough..

however i have put together with the indicators together.. as in..

Still open +71 pips

Thanks Jubu

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Already resolved that but in another way for the next update, just made it try again, and again.... But that is a good idea to, thanks, although i don't think I'll implement it.

Well that's why the divergence. I didn't switch the distance ehl to 30 on any pair and i trade from about 7 am to 22 am so far. But you should have had one on gj yesterday at 1500 GMT.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Peter, u said you like playing around with the sl and tp. Did you find anything interesting yet ?

Did anyone else have the 100 loss on EU today?

Hi Jubu

I' ve only had time a little bit, been busy with other things

much the same results across the different risk ratios R:R 11 21 12

Its needs discretion when entering ie yesterdays EU had signs of reversal (divergence) hence I did not take it , This would not be picked up on the EA as it is and its these types of entries that will bring down the winning edge if just followed blindly

There is nothing wrong with the entry system- i like it alot for its simpleness and in conjunction with other indies like round numbers, sr etc and basic PA I will stick with the system for the time being.

I attach a sample of the case where the EA would take the trade and not take into account the Support level (which stands out like a sore thumb) and hence would result in another loss - although according to Ronnies rules alot of people woiuld not take it cos the signals appeared around 3.00 GMT - but he only uses these rules of trading hours  cos it is his hours of being awake

I would like to know what other peoples results are like cos the strategy tester frustrates me  and if anyone is getting "the edge" convincingly with it

Using JUBUS ea

--- 帖子 #807 ---
I agree with what you said 100%.  I leave the EA running while doing other trading, to allow it to alert me to the setups Ronnie has laid  out as his criteria to enter the trade, but from that point I always analyze S/R Over bought/sold , blah, blah blah,   on the pair before entering the trade manually.  and also track the trade while its on to take it off  if it is struggling  .  Ive been trading this system for a good 2 weeks with very good results ( no losers yet ) Ronnie's setup seems solid (Thanks Ronnie) , and the EA is doing real well also( you have done a very fine job Jubu), but more as a second set of eyes to the setups rather than a set it and forget it .. . as a point . I am in the AUDCAD right not alerted by the EA ,  but looking at the daily it will most likely  struggle around the 50 or 60 pip mark, so I will take it off early rather than hold out for the other 40 that may not come.

Take Care

Hi, I'm new to this forum and thread. Been trading 18 months, still got some money! I've read all the posts, downloaded the EA and indicators, set it all up and been running on a demo since Monday. Very impressive, the results mirror other users' results. What a fantastic system and EA, thanks Ronnie and JuBu.I'll probably go live with it after easter on a micro account on minimum risk. I'll let you know how I get on.Thanks again. W.

ronnie may i ask.. what trades do u have for this week ?

i only had 1 trade based on ur rules but i set it using jubu ea..

only had EU sell (loss) -100 pips

im having 1 GU buy now (which i took myself although jubu didnt give me any signal)

--- 帖子 #814 ---
A very quiet week this week (probably one of the quietest I've seen since trading this)

Only had 2 trades, those being:-

13/04    E/U    -100

15/04    G/U    Still in play, currently -40

There was a very close setup on U/CHF, but the distance between the 15 EMA and low of candle was 31 pips (my limit is 30), and typically it went on to make the 100.

Let's hope for a bit more action next week.

Have a good weekend.

@ JUBU

jubu, probability of winning trades enhances tremendously once you consider heikin ashi closes only once price bounces of 15 EMA    &

if added an option of - min range of closing heikin ashi bar's high/low from 15 EMA (ex : 20-32 or x -x), it filters a lot of bad trades & provides few signals .... strategy becomes more powerful.

ronnie just wanna ask since i suddenly thought bout it..

the very beginning, 3 moving averages..

MA METHOD IS ? simple, exponential?

APPLY to is ?? close ??

hehe..

--- 帖子 #820 ---
15 exp applied to close

50 exp applied to high

50 exp applied to low

--- 帖子 #821 ---
okays.. just wanted to make sure..anyway i see a gu sell pending...

anyone taking that ?

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Yes I have a pending order for G/U also closed a EurJpy for 100 from Friday and a GbpJpy for 100 put on Sunday evening and that one came to the pip before bouncing up

--- 帖子 #823 ---
funny thing is.. the pending GU order was cancelled by the ea itself.. but i don see the candles touching the ema15..so does this ea has a auto cancel order maybe like after 1 hour of unfilled orders? can we modify the duration of pending order(put an expiry option) or only cancel when the subsequent candle touches ema15

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi,I don't think it's one of your fave pairs Ronnie, but my EA just  (about 15:30 London time) put a sell on USDJPY. +20 pips at the mo. Demo Acc.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Just Like to say thanks to Ronnie for a great strategy and Jubu for automation

Here is what I am doing

I am using the EA on a demo system and as it picks trades I go live with the trade if it has a good trend around it without previous testing of Strong support resistance levels

I have the EA on all currency pairs

Sometime I cash in early

I am using the system as a basket trading system

ie I may have 8 currency pairs triggered but, if my total AccountProfit reaches a certain level  I cash in and start again

The Profit level is dicated by the lotsize and amount of pairs I have in live

I have yet to try this strategy on smaller time frames, no time at the moment

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Ok Hawk here's the indi you asked for. It works only on heiken ashi candles and as I previously stated, there is not much of a difference between the two, actually this one shows more signals then the other one. Check it out and tell me what you think.

thank you so much jubu

i"ll get back to you on this ... on saturday.

hello ,

i like the strategy , and want to go test it life ,

but i just have few questions

first :

how long it take on average to hit +50 pips (breakeven so i can change my s/l to be)

how long it take on average to hit t/p and s/l

also do u close some trades manually  and if so ? what  u base the close on?

macd bars or signals etc?

thanks

--- 帖子 #829 ---
sorry to bother again,

if anyone from traders using this system on the forum using any indicators as filters or confirmation tools , was reading and found some guy told to use rsi law girl something like that , i wander does it work for him and if yes can he post the indicator to use it as confirmation

thanks

not a good week for me..

how bout u guys ?

--- 帖子 #841 ---
i have used ronierott metthod yesterday and got 4 winning trades

but i dont w8 for 100+ pips as i am impatient and newbie so i dont have the experience to w8 that long

i use other indicators as confirmation like trix , i use also ronierott on lower time frames to see how to look like so i can choose the best entry position,

my winning trades wasnt too much , about 25-30 pips each and actually some of them went too high later like nzd/usd but i dont regret since i am still learning

my s/l is manually but it is about a combination of about 50 pips also putting in consideration pivots and S and r

btw , i believe this strategy is very good but i dont believe in the tp/ sl  it is kinda not flexible and every trade has its circumstances

--- 帖子 #842 ---
A grey EA icon means you have the exe code and not the mq4 code.

It has no effecton the performance of the EA, just means you will not be able to edit the code.

On the forums most people post mq4 code and when you put it in your experts folder the platform compiles it when it starts up.  There are a lot of virus softwares that do not like to let you upload .exe files for obvious reasons so zip the exe files or post the mq4 files.

--- 帖子 #843 ---

I have an Easter update of the EA , you may download it below.

Improvements :

1) Fixed a bug

2) Added AllowNextTrade Option. If you keep this to "true" it will enter another trade on the same pair if the current trade is at B/E.

3) Added UseCustomStop option. This is like a trailing stop only it just moves the SL once or like a custom B/E. For example : you have 2 more modifiable parameters to this option, CustomStopHitPrice and CustomStopLoss. What this means is if the price hits the CustomStopHitPrice, lets say 80 pips (by default) above opening price on a long trade, it will move the SL to the CustomStopLoss value (above opening price), lets say 50 (by default).

You might ask how is this different from the trailing stop. Well it is because the distance between the two parameters is custom and the modification only happens once, that way you can use values that are close to each other (i.e. 50 - 80)

Oh.. and the magic number on which the EA works is 123 so don't use other EAs with the same magic number.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Is it the default MA with MT4 used with this system? If not, would someone be kind enough to post one?

Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Hiya

I am getting a "critical crash" in MQ4 when loading up the new EA version

is anyone else getting this

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Hello Ronnierott,

Thank you for this strategy. I am trying to learn break-outs for a while and this one sure looks great.

Could you please tell me if I am getting this right?

On the image I have attached below,

* The "Yellow" arrow marked Candle touched the 15 EMA the closed below it at 1.4822 (Red line), so we call it the setup candle and place a Sell Limit at 1.4812 (Blue line) ?

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Me too

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Hmm.. that is strange cause i'm not getting any error and i put it on without the source code on another computer but it works fine. I think you ment MT4 not MQ4 right ?

Anybody else getting the critical error with the new EA ? And if yes do you get it all the time or just some times ?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
yep sorry mt4

The problem is that once I get the error after loading the ea it closes the whole platform

and when i try to restart the platform i get the error straight away, consequently I end up having to delet my whole mt4 environment , to get going again

It may have something to do with the compilation pointers being machine dependant

For me to test could you send us PM the source code so I can try by compiling myself and see if it crashes

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Try deleting the EA instead of the whole enviroment and then restart you MT4. What broker are you using ? I have a feeling this is broker related.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
MT4. Sorry for that

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Hi Jubu!

Again, thanks for Your work with the EA. Ver 2.3 get my MT4 crashed, I have tested it with IBFX, Oanda and PFG. I removed the EA from its folder, then I could start MT4 again. So its not necesary tho remove the hole MT4 folder.

I think it would be good if we had the option to add spread for long trade in the EA settings. I know we can adjust it in "Distance between high/low and order price".......but with many pairs its easy to forget that, sometimes can the change from short to long happens when we sleep. Im not a programmer so I dont know if its easy or not.

Best wishes

Elovv

--- 帖子 #860 ---
OK.. I've done some research and found that if you update the mt4 to v.4.00 build 399, the critical error will not appear any more and the EA will work fine. So what you have to do is just update your mt4. I've tried this with 2 different brokers that at first gave the error but after the update all was fine.

Try this and tell me what happens.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hi AmareX,

The first thing to look at is the MACD.

In this instant it's green, so you are only going to be looking at long trades. The setup candle will be one that touches the 15 EMA and closes above it (As long as the rest of the criteria is met, as per the instructions on the first page of this thread)

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
How do we update mt4? I downloaded a installer from Ibfx and installed in the same folder as it already whas installed in. Do I have to unistall first? Its still version 229.

Elovv

--- 帖子 #863 ---
In the folder were the mt is installed there is a file named LiveUpdate.exe

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Already test that. Nothing happens still ver229

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Than it's your's brokers fault.. I guess..

--- 帖子 #866 ---
You guess right

I have the last ver 399 on PFG and it works. I have chatted with IBFX and Oanda and they have not the new 399 version yet so I have to wait.

Do You test many pairs?

I trade 7 pairs E/U, G/U, E/G, U/J, U/C, G/J, and NZD/CHF.

Currently this week I've had (I started trading live Tuesday) :

U/C sell: B/E

G/J sell: -100

E/U buy: +100

N/C sell: -6 (currently playing)

G/U buy: +22 (currently playing)

E/U buy: - 18 (currently playing)

U/J sell:  +7 (currently playing)

So overall not such a great week but not a very bad one either. It's hanging in there.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Thanks...do You add spread on long trades?

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Hi Jubu,

Thanks for creating the great EA!

According to my observation of trending system based on moving average, I think there may be a way to make the SL more reasonable.

Instead of just using fixed SL and TP and BE at 50 pips, I wonder if you could add another option that traders can choose as one of the SL strategies?

The new SL strategy is to set the SL according to the value of the newly closed EMA minus (for long trade) or plus (for short trade) certain pips(for example 10 pips below or above the closed EMA15). Every time a candle is closed, the EA should modify the SL according to the new value of the EMA on the closed candle. Keep modifying SL this way, till the SL or TP is hitted. The type of EMA(for example EMA5, EMA15) and the SL Pips away from EMA should be options that traders can input.

The reason is when the trend is strong, most time the price can hardly touch the EMA or cross the EMA too far... I think this way we can reduce the risks of big SL. Of course, sometimes, it may result in less profit.

What do you guys think about this?

Sorry for my poor English.

--- 帖子 #871 ---

--- 帖子 #874 ---
OK.. here's another EA update. I found some errors in the code and fixed them. I'm sorry for that. Now it's working properly.

1. Fixed trailing stop code. The code was wrong it only placed a few trails then when the sl over passed the opening price it ceased to go on. Fixed that, now it's working properly. For those of you who backtested with the trailing stop, again I apologize.

2. Fixed the Allow Next Trade code. It also had an error. Now it's working fine as it should have.

3. I added an ExitOfEMA parameter as a fellow member of the forum suggested earlier. If you set this to true it will exit a trade if the price goes below/above EMA15 by a preset number of pips given by the DistanceOfExitFromEMA parameter.

Oh.. and don't forget to update you mt to build 399 otherwise the mt will crash when loading the EA.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Thanks so much! Will give it a try!

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Thanks a lot Jubu for all your efforts! Great work!

My broker is Alpari which obviously uses build 225 !

That means I cannot use your latest EA version ???

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Dont worry, I think Jubu will be issuing the source code version and if you compile it for your version it will work

Ta

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Hi Jubu,

Thanks so much. Today I tested  the new EMA exit strategy, it worked very well!

EURCAD long trade had a profit of 80 pips at first and then crashed and hitted the EMA15-10pips. It exit with a profit of 10 pips instead of BE+1

I wonder if you can set the ExitEMA as an Parameter? I wanted to try different EMAs as exit strategy. For example: EMA10 minus or plus 10 pips may worked better than EMA15.

Thanks again for the great work!!!

--- 帖子 #879 ---
You can modify the ema parameter to whatever you want, its called EMA and you can also modify the emaexit parameter, it's called DistenceOfExitFromEMA. Look into the EA properties and change them to whatever you want.

And also those of you who have older versions of mt and get a crash, you need to have the source code and compile it yourselves in order for the EA to work. If you want the source code send me a pm and I'll send you a link where you can download it from. Or just update you mt to build 399.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
I see. Thank you so much!

An experimental week, thought I'd try a few pairs on 5 min charts, to see if the action increased...tp 25, sl 50, be 12. All other settings default.4/5   GBP/JPY  +27.6  5/5   GBP/USD  +2   5/5   GBP/USD  +23   5/5   GBP/JPY   +25   5/5   USD/JPY   -50   5/5   EUR/USD  +25   5/5   GBP/USD  +25   6/5   EUR/USD  +2   6/5   EUR/USD  +25                Total      +104.6Interesting, think I 'll try another week!

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Very interesting , what pairs are you using ?? just the ones you list  ie GU GJ UJ EU

SL 50 mmm !!!! TP 25

Is this with the EA or manual

Maybe we should set up a test team

One does 5 min another 15 min another say 1 H and another maybe 4H , although the one doing 4 H may end up falling asleep hahah

When I place the orders I only place the EA on the good trending pairs or have just reversed  , Seem to work quite well

and I dont always necessarity wait to 100 TP  cos as my entry rate is better I can afford to cash in earlier

--- 帖子 #883 ---
OK.. so here are my trades for this week live only with the EA, nonstop.

GBPUSD - BUY : B/E +1 pip

EURUSD - BUY : B/E +1 pip

NZDCHF - SELL : +100

The above ones started last week but ended this week

GBPJPY - SELL : B/E +1pip

GBPUSD - SELL : B/E +1pip

USDJPY - SELL : +100

GBPJPY - SELL : +100

USDCHF - SELL : B/E +1pip

EURGBP - BUY : -100

GBPJPY - SELL : B/E +1pip

EURUSD - SELL : B/E +1pip

USDCHF - BUY : B/E +1pip

EURUSD - SELL : +100

EURGBP - SELL : +100

GBPUSD - SELL : B/E +5 (Closed this one manually)

So overall +413 pips this week. Not bad for sitting back and relaxing.

I'm thinking we should get more organized with this strategy. We should have have people testing or backtesting the strategy with different parameters and then sharing the results for everyone to see and benefit from improving this strategy. I for example found that on EURUSD the best parameters (backtested one year) are SL 200, TP 200, and no B/E. I am not using currently these parameters but am planing to in the future after more live testing. Every pair has it's own dynamic and it's own volatility so every pair must work better with different parameters.

And also I'm thinking of creating a special website for this strategy, and probably other ones in the future. What do you think of this idea ? Is it good, is it bad, is it worth it ? And why ?

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Good going JuBu, well done.  The EA is great.

The question of optimisation is very difficult. I suppose it would be like hitting a moving target as each pair changes in time and is never the same  for long, evolving continually in the market.

Difficult to predict and fix with backtesting unless tested every month or so.

Someone here earlier mentioned that the best way forward is to perhaps look at the avarage daily or true ranges for a given pair and working out the best SL and TP at the moment the trade is placed.  Rather than rigid pips.

At least that way the system/EA would be constantly up to date with present market conditions.

- encouraging ...  the credit goes to ronnie and you !

- with approval from ronnie, one website should do

- website - non-commercial & easy to follow, beginners would benefit from this strategy & existing users can agressively exchange inputs in the advancement of strategy

- it must have a chat room & a forum dedicated ONLY for this strategy

=-=  the idea is totally worth it as an aggressive approach in terms of learning can be followed on a whole website dedicated to one strategy & multiple users can upload their testing results on different timeframes as suggested by peter, on entire different threads.

this baby needs further nurturing.

ever since i came across this strategy, i knew it would evolve to great length & cross a few thousand pages with global users benefiting from this strategy.

all credit goes to ronnie & jubu & i thank you a lot for teaching me how to fish. the famous quote comes to mind ...

"Give a man a fish,you feed him for a day.Teach a man to fish,and you feed him for a lifetime."

regards

Great Job!!!!

I started testing the new EA with Exit by hitting EMA strategy on 20 pairs from May 4th.  I used standard account with deposit of $3000, 0.01 lot. Today I check and the profit is 414 pips (+$51.8) with DD of  -11 pips ($-1.4). Please check the attached for details. There are 4 trades that resulted with none +-100 or +1 pips. These trades exited by hitting the EMA+-10 pips.

I still have not get any result if the EMA exit is better than fixed TP or SL or not. I just can tell that the new exit strategy will shorten the trade length...I will go on testing and see.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
hi jubu,

Great job.

Even Iam newbie to forex i can say this is excellent result of any standards. Thanks for your EA.  I am still using old version.  I'll try new version now.  And thanks to Ronnie also.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Lots of BE trades, maybe having multiple TP's would be a good suggestion.

i.e.

TP1 @ +50 pips (50% of trade closes and move SL to BE.)

TP2 @ +100 pips

--- 帖子 #889 ---
And you used EMA +-10, not +-30 as i made it by default ?

Pretty good. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Hi Jubu,

On this weeks results did you use the Default settings for your EA or did you tweek any of the parameters ex.. SL or TP settings ect.... Thanks to you, Ronnie and all the contributors on this thread.  I have been trading along with you Guys from the beginning with positive results and will start posting the results of my trades at the end of the week.

Thanks Again All

Take Care

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Yes, the one I used is +-10 pips from EMA 15. Actually the one I really want to use is EMA10+-10 pips.

I have a question, you said I can change it to EMA10 for the parameter named EMA. I wonder will this change also affects the entry rule? I do not want to change the entry rules for Runni's system so I want to make sure before I change the EMA value.

Thanks again Jubo and Ronni for your great EA and system!!!

--- 帖子 #892 ---
No I didn't change any parameters. All remained default on all pairs. I am planing on changing them in the future if i get better results with other parameters.

Yes if you change the EMA which is now 15 to any other value it will also change the entry of the trades. I didn't think to add another ema specially for this exit when i made it. Maybe on the next update I'll add the separate EMA.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Hi, Alpari allows to use only MT4 255. So what do you advise? Trade manually as i think :-)

--- 帖子 #894 ---
buy at 27th april az 12:00. after it moved down up to 66 pip. than up 166. and you have to check when to out. use psar, or what you prefer. i dont like use fix out, because than u can loose some great pip. but s/l fixed. it can be also closed earlier if EMA 15 passes EMA 50 LOW (+10-15pips)

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Sorry for the delay, been wrapped up in local spring celebrations this weekend.

The results were exclusively EA, no manual intervention at all - just let it run, with the settings I mentioned.

This coming week I'll do the same thing for the full week.

let you know the results.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Im trying to test this jubus ea but every broker I try my mt4 crashes and i get error msg lol, which broker do you guys use for this ea?

Thx

P.S found cpl of brokers with mt4 build 399 so going to test the ea this week, will also trade this system manually.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
I have used it on FXDD, with no problems.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
When I backtest the EA I see a 65% drawdown? Default settings @ 1h @ G/U

--- 帖子 #899 ---
I also did some backtests and all of them look pretty bad, best is on EU 48% winners, 600 pips for 12 months period-you can make that in 2 weeks trading manually. To be honest I havent seen an ea which is worth putting on live account so far. Problem is ea's dont see S/R lvls, thats only 1 of the reasons ea's dont work. Just think about it if ea's were able to make money would anyone bother with manual trading?

And we all know every pro successfull trader trades manually

HankT

P.S I will be forward testing this ea anyway just to see how it performs, Anyone knows if it works with ecn brokers? I mean you cant place market order with preset sl,tp with ecn broker. So the only way would be to use MPTM ea to set sl,tp right?

--- 帖子 #900 ---
I am curious why this system have so much drawdown...because it has 100 pips stop loss. Also, the result is good or not depends on the market situation. Trending market is better than ranging for this system. For example, when I did my backtest, I got different result for EUR/USD for different period.

So, in forward testing or live trade, you may determine when to use this EA and when to stop using it depending on your opinion of the market. There are a lot of ways to determine the trend.

I found an indicator here:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&postcount=18

Maybe an MA angle can filter some bad trades?

So, when trading forward it is totally different from the backtest.

Just my two cents...

--- 帖子 #901 ---
&quot;Im trying to test this jubus ea but every broker I try my mt4 crashes and i get error msg lol, which broker do you guys use for this ea?&quot;    I've been trading over 18 months now Hank and have tried many EA's TA's etc, all work on Alpari's MT4 with no probs. As for profitability, that's another story.........</p>

--- 帖子 #902 ---
There is no such thing as a set and forget EA

I like this strategy and the way I use the EA is like this

I set it up as per my params I like and save it as a template

then I use ronnie signal ind to alert me to a potential trade

After assessing the trend , SR levels etc , reversals I load up the template or forget the signal  and wait for the next signal

If you blindly put this on a currency pair and just forget about it you will not see a great return , more to 50 50 ,

The trend is the secret here  for this strategy , Do not put this on a ranging pair or you are just playing the 50 50

also there are some cuirrencies that trend but the retracement can be quite large so be careful ie 100 SL is not enough

--- 帖子 #903 ---
you place pending order after the signal so tell me why you need an ea? The whole idea of trading ea is to set it up and forget it. If you need to watch charts than you trade manually you dont use ea to enter trades, whats the point?

if you need ea to manage your trade use mptm tho I dont recommend it cos it freezes your mt4 and it has milion settings-90% of them you dont need lol.

Not mention the guide which doesnt explain well how to set it right if you not familiar with mptm.

HankT

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Thats the same way I have used this EA with very good results.  I use it to "alert me" to the trades , then I analyze from there to see if the trade has legs or not, once i put the trade on i also manage it until it is closed.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Yeh your right about mptm ,

Later when I have proved this strategy i might used partial closurre etc  but for now

I use the EA like this

Signal sent to me say at 9.00 am , I see the trend for the last two days is down  and its a good trend

I can then put the EA template on for that day and chances are it will trigger that day

By the way I have made 200 pips today and am up 100 pips on my floating account profit as I write  this so I beleive it works so I am happy

In fact you all should of all got these trades if you had used the ronnie strategy of only using GU EU UC etc cos these were made with GU EU

--- 帖子 #906 ---
I beg to differ. That is exactly that I'm doing (with the exact same default parameters on all pairs) and it's been working out very well. Yeah maybe you're right about earning more if you watch the trend and all that closely to see if it's going well in that direction or not, but wait, that can be implemented into the EA too as an option and it will be in the next update. I will implement an option to see and trade in correlation with the trend on an upper tf like H4 or D1. Hmmm..... and this gives me an idea for an indicator update to.

Oh.. and what SR levels are we talking about here, Daily or Weekly ones? Maybe I'll do something with these too. Although I don't know exactly what now. But I'll think about it.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
The EA is running for ~20 hours, still not a single trade entered..

Default settings @ E/U @ H1 @ 4 digitbroker @ default settings.

Any advice :-) ?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
have you got a smiley face top right hand corner

what currency pairs are you trading , just EU???

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Check the EA's properties to see if you have the "Allow live trading" checkbox on and make sure you have pushed the "Expert Advisors" button. If yes than check the Experts and Journal tab and see if it gave you any errors and if it did than what are they ?

Actually there is a signal and a pending order right now on E/U. It should have entered.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Agreed on all counts jubu. That trade was spot on. Also, your EA is damn near perfect. It's just a gnat's whisker away from being the 'set and forget' EA. This is what you're striving for here isn't it?

I'm continuing with the 5M screens where there were 5 active trades and 5 cancelled trades today alone. Will post week's results.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Daily S/R would be awesome but as far as I know there is no ea which can see those, another thing, do you remember how amazing was fapturbo, look at it now lol its worse than any free ea, for some reason all ea's only work well for short period of time than they useless, its kinda weird dont you think?

--- 帖子 #912 ---
OK.. so last night's topic gave me an idea for a update of the indicator and here it is, v3.

What's New ?

-The Trend direction monitor of H1, H4, and D1 in the top right corner(the corner is modifiable in the properties).

The function determines the trend using two EMAs of 50 applied to high and low just like the strategy does. If the price is above the emas then it's an uptrend and the indi will display UP, if it is in between the two emas it will display IN-BETWEEN, and if it's below the emas it will display DOWN. Each way has it's own color. UP is blue, IN-BETWEEN is yellow and DOWN is red. The colors can be changes also to whatever you preferences are.

The High and Low EMAs of the trend determination are separate from the High and Low EMAs of the signal determination so they can be changed without influencing the signals.

The new parameters are :
TendEMAs = 50; //This represents the period of the high and low EMAs of the Trend determination.
LongTrendColor = Blue; //This represents the color of the displayed text in case of a Long(Bullish) trend.
ShortTrendColor = Red; //This represents the color of the displayed text in case of a Short(Bearish) trend.
InBetweenTrendColor = Yellow; //This represents the color of the displayed text in case the price is in between the emas.
Corner = 1; //This represents the corner in which the text will be displayed: 0=TopLeft, 1=TopRight, 2=BottomLeft, 3=BottomRight

Others
I will include also include a template that works best with this indicator and 3 more indicators which I use on this template. You may find them useful. The other 3 indicators are not made by me and I take no credit for them. They are from another strategy but I thought I could use them here as well.

One shows weekly pivots which I found to be very strong, another shows the time left for the candle to close beside the candle and the last is a panel with other info.

If you are new to the forum note that you will also need this indicator for the template : Macd-with-EMA.mq4

If you have any more ideas that I should include into the indicator for a better performance, please don't hesitate to tell me.

*Edit : If you have an older build of MT you will have to compile the mq4 file i order for the indicator to work.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Hello Jubu,

One question: Is your new version compatible with build 225 (the old MT4 version of e. g. Alpari) or do we still have problems with the EA if MT4 uses an older MT4 version?

BTW thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Jubu,

I have a question about the EMA exit. I set the pips from EMA to 0 so that the trade will exit when hitting EMA15. But it seems this does not work. The trade exit by hitting the -100 SL instead of the EMA15. Is this normal?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #915 ---
can't wait to test it! Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I think you're taliking about the indicator and not the EA and if so it doesn't matter because you have the source code and can compile it yourself on any build or version of the mt. If you want the EA to work on a older version of the MT please give me a pm asking me for the source code and I will send you a download link. After copiling it the EA will work.

Are you sure you turned the UseExitOfEMA parameter to true. Cause it should work with the value 0 too. I backtested it with the DistanceOfExitFromEMA set to 0 and it worked fine. If it still dosn't work try and see if it gives you any errors in the Journal or Experts tabs at the moment of exit.

Important : See post #912 for new v3 update of the indicator.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Hi Wayne

How is it going this week on the five minute charts

ALso a question

how many pips do you set from the high or low for the trigger

not 10 is it ??? mustr be 3 or something

It is temptingly close to the niceguy ridiculous 7 pip trading system except they do not use pending trades , they just go straight in and also the ma have slightly different params

I would like to see this work for you.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Hi peterporter,Variable week so far, as expected! About even at the mo. I've left the trigger at 10 for another week, then will try a lower figure next week. It's an ongoing experiment which I'm not supposing will make me rich, lol. I'm not familiar with the 'niceguy' system but will have a look, presumably it's on a forum on this site?Thanks for you encouragement. W.

--- 帖子 #919 ---

Hi, please check the picture. I have set it to 10 pips this morning. But it still does not work...EU/AU should have closed at 10 pips above EMA15, but the price is already above EMA+10pips and the trade is still going and did not exit...

So confused, it did work last week...

--- 帖子 #922 ---
I  don't know what to say.. it should work and it did as you said, last week. Check the EMA parameter, maybe you changed that... or restart you mt.. I don't know what more to say, try checking for EA errors in the Experts and Journal tabs.

Jubu,

Thanks very much for your reply! I have restarted the MT4. I will keep trying to see if it works in the future trades.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Silly question 1 - How do you add someone elses quote in a blue box, the way most of you do when you're answering someone. Silly question 2 - How do you publish your results as a list, rather than a scrambled mess like mine! Any help would be appreciated. W.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
1: at right bottom corner of each post there is a button named "Quote", just click it and you will add the quote.

2.don't know. For me, I just print screen of the trades and save it as a picture and post the picture here. My lazy way to post my test results

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Jubu,

Please check the attachment. I just found that the new alert tells me place buy stop cadchf at 0.9241 which is according to the latest candle. But the open order by EA still shows the original price of 0.9269. I wonder if we should edit the pending order to reflect the latest signal or just leave it as is? Thanks very much!

Regards,

--- 帖子 #930 ---
If you delete the pending order and put it at another price manually the EA will not manage it and will ignore it, as if it doesn't exist. The EA placed it at that price probably because it couldn't for some reason at the first price, or maybe it placed it on another signal at that price. If you really don't like that price the only thing you can do is to delete the order an wait for the EA to immediately place another one possibly at the right price this time, or not. But the EA will place the order only if the first candle from the signal candle is still in play and not finished. If it's finished there's nothing you can do.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Thanks for your explanation. I thought the EA will automatically modify the pending orders. Now I know what should I do.

Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Thanks Ronnierott for a great system, and thanks

Jubu for the awesome EA.

Live since May 1st, and up 454 pips, taking all trades

the EA picks up on the 4 recommended pairs.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Congratulations!

Which pairings do you trade? And do you apply the original settings (SL and TP = 100) ?

--- 帖子 #934 ---
I trade Ronnierott's recommended pairs (g/u,e/u,u/c,g/j).

I trade the ea's default settings except on u/c and g/j, the max distance

between ema15 and high/low is set to 30 instead of 50. And I have been

closing any open winning positions on Friday afternoon. (For May so far:

6 wins, 4 break evens, and 0 losses.)

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Hi,

do you use the "UseExitOfEMA" parameter?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Hi Jubu,

I am new in this forum.

I have a Alpari MT4 build 299 , so can it possible for me to install your EA?

because i afraid about the crash of my MT4.

Please advise.

Thanks & Regards,

Immortal??............. Now, that would be nice    :-)

--- 帖子 #940 ---
The EA will automatically modify orders or pending orders that have the magic number 123.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
No, just TP and SL = 100

useexitofema set to false

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Jubu,

Great EA.  I've been following this thread with interest for some time.  I'm definitely impressed with test results so far.

Would it be possible to change these numeric settings into the universal MT4 type of pop-up inputs window for color choices?

Hope so.

Thanks again for all your time and efforts!

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi,

This is the second week I test the EMA exit. It still works after I restarted my MT4. I regret not using another demo account to test the EA with the EMA exit set to false. That way, it would be easier to compare which strategy is better. Anyway, I attached the trading history.

Still tested on more than 20 pairs (to have more chance to observe the EMA exit) with 0.01 standard lot. Total of 26 trades for this week, +170 pips (+$18.14). I closed the CHF/JPY manually today with a gain of 74 pips. The rest trades are all entered and exited by the EA.

Balance: $3069.94 ($3000 deposit)

Equity:  $3072.04

--- 帖子 #944 ---
OK.. so here are this weeks results using the EA with standard parameters nonstop :

E/U +100

U/C +100 (actually this should have been +100 if I hadn't closed it manually because of my stupid intuition)

G/U +100

7 trades @ B/E +7

3 trades currently in play.. N/C, U/J and G/U

So.. a total of 307 pips this week. Not bad.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
I got 2 winners on my account, with 4 BE's - So 204 pips

G/U +100

U/C +100

3 trades still running, U/J, G/U and G/J of which two are at SL/BE now.

@ Jubu - Are you using the new version Jubu? Does it 'trade' any differently?

@ Ronnie - Would you mind me asking what your biggest weekly/monthly loss was?

--- 帖子 #946 ---
I'm up 725 pips since the 1st of May with your EA.

No losses so far.

A million thanks to you and Ronnierott.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Yes I am trading the last version and yes, it probably trades differently depending on what version you use. The parameter that would make the difference would be AllowNextTrade.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
PLEASE READ EVERYTHING IN THIS POST.

Here's the last(for now) version of the EA.

Before I tell you about what's new in this version I want to let you know that I will be adding no more options to the EA in the near future. First we will have to test or backtest these ones and eliminate the unuseful ones because the EA is getting too complicated and hard to understand and that is not a good thing.

Now about the EA update to v3:

1. Added EMAOfExit parameter to the UseExitOfEMA option. What this means is that the ExitOfEMA option does not depend any more on the global EMA parameter. Now you can change the value of EMA at which the EA should exit a trade without haveing to change the whole system of entry.

Parameters:
EMAOfExit = 15 // Period of EMA

2. Fixed a little bug in the code of the ExitOfEMA option. This is regarding the issue at post #922. The issue shiningstar was having.

3. Added Continuous TrailingStop. This trails the SL pip by pip. The other trailing stop trails by the exact distance.

Parameters:
UseContinuousTrailingStop = false // ON or OFF switch.
UseTakeProfit = true // If this is set to false it will trail the stop until the price hits it.
ContinuousTrailingStop = 50 // Distance between price an StopLoss.

4. Added UseTrendsCondition. When this is set to true the EA will only enter a trade if the 3 time frames (H1, H4 and Dalily, like the indicator shows) have the same trend "UP" or "DOWN".

Parameters:
UseTrendsCondition = false // ON/OFF switch

TendEMAs = 50; // This represents the value of the periods of the two EMAs(one applide to high price, and the other to low) used for the trend determination. These are separate from the signal ones.

Other useful info.

If you don't know what all those parameters in the EA are, here are the links to the other EA and indicator updates where I explain every parameter.

RonnieSignals : post #556 and #528

RonnieSignals v2.1 : post  #579

RonnieRott's by JuBu : post #604

RonnieRott's By JuBu v2 and Ronnie Signals v2.2 : post #689

RonnieSignals on Heiken Ashi : post #826 (This one is separate)

RonnieRott's By JuBu v2.3 : post  #850

RonnieRott's By JuBu v2.6 : post #874

RonnieSignals v3 + TEMPLATE and 3 more useful indicators : post  #912

Note : Don't download the old ones, some of them are bugged. I just mentioned them for info.

Also I will add the RonnieSignals v3 here because i have made some changes to the "Color of Trend's" parameters. Instead if being integers(numbers as colors) they are normal colors now(Red, Blue.. etc.) for you to chose from. Thanks to forexhard in post #942 for pointing that out.

This time I will only give you the source code (mq4 file) of the EA and Indi for you to compile yourself. Hope this will eliminate all broker/build issues.

Now for the testing part.

As I said up above I will not create another version of this EA until we have tested all the options that we have so far and have found the best results. Now for that to happen I will need your help and whoever wants to help is welcomed.

I will give you below a Microsoft Word document named Backtesting.doc which you will have to fill out with the results of your backtests. This document only contains 16 different combinations of 5 parameters. You will have to backtest on the pairs enlisted with the parameters that I give you in the document, fill out the results and post them on the forum. The testing will be done only in US$ so be careful when you set the currency of the backtest.

This is only the first part of testing. After finding the best result for these pairs we will continue to combine them with other options that we have within the EA.

When you will backtest, you are only to change the parameters written in the file, the other ones remain the same for now. I have written in Bold the parameters that need to be changed after one backtest in the file.

Only possible updates in the near future will be for fixing bugs.

Have a nice weekend and to as many pips as possible!

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Jubu - Many thanks for this,the very least I can do is offer to help out.

let me know what you would like me to do , I've never done any backtesting before I'm afraid but have a spare PC to run them.

(ronnie, my apology for an offline topic)

food for thought on a sunday :

Guys

for a very useful thread like this, how do you guys copy all posts in one file with minimal effort

i tried using software's like offline explorer & blah blah.. to copy entire thread but not impressive.

i wish just like forexhard has all jubu EA updated in one pdf file, a thread could be copied in entirety without copy/paste posts manually in one pdf or ms word document.

Hi Ronnierot!

Do You still trade the 4 pairs in the beginning of this thread?

Do You allow new trades if the old is + 50 pips and BE?

Best wishes

Elovv

--- 帖子 #960 ---
well not such a good start this week

stopped out on E/U -100.........and 2 trades well in the red G/U and G/J

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Hi Elovv,

In answer to your questions, the answer is yes & yes.

However, I'm so impressed with Jubu's EA (especially having the trend filter for 1HR, 4 HR & Daily trends) I'm starting to demo an additional 6 pairings and will see how they go.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hi Stricky,

Agree, not the best of starts for the week...

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hi Ronnie,

do you use the ExitOfEma Parameter?

Thanks

Hi Trentano,

Hi Ronnierott,

In testing new pairs, how do you decide on 30 or 50 for distance between

ema15 and high/low parameter.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Yes, it's a bad beginning, BUT after the last wee, with huge of winning, no problem.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
This is the worst week ever.

So far -400 pips for me this week

Almost took all it gave me the last two weeks in just on day. -200 more pips and I'm back to where I started. Maybe Ronnie's right just trading the 4 pairs. But even with those it would have been -300 pips so far this week.

We have to do something about these loosing trades. Filter them out somehow. But how ?

What your worst week been Ronnie ? -400, - 500 ?

--- 帖子 #968 ---
-300 here too Jubu

not good

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Hi Boldpoint,

I chose those figures after spending many hours going back over the charts.

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Hi Jubu,

If I can remember rightly, my worst week was -300

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Let's see how this week ends up. We still have 3 and half more days to go, maybe we'll recover. Let's remain positive.

By the way, did anybody start backtesting and filling out those results ?

--- 帖子 #972 ---
The beginning of this week is bad for me too, I am still testing on more than 20 pairs with the EMA exit strategy. Thanks very much for fixing the bug. It works very well now. There were 12 trades closed since the beginning of this week.  I lost 270 pips so far. My balance for the $3000 demo account went back to $3039 from $3069(balance of last week)..... I will keep on testing and see what will happen.

Thanks again for all your work!

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Hi Jubu,

Just i start this week with the EA and i loss -400 in one day, i think u are right we nee to do something about it. i am also in the same ship.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Hi guys, here's a little update of the EA. I improved it a little bit cause I saw that when backtesting with this last version it worked very hard due to the Trend corelation function which works on different TF's and gets the strategy tester confused. BTW you cannot backtest the Trend direction function, only real time testing.

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Hi folks,

I found a very interesting strategy in another forum. Normally it´s for 4 h chart but it is working for 1 h chart, too.

Rules are as follows ....

1. for short signals, arrow prints on price action and the white line  with RED histogram (rsi histogram indicator) MUST be BELOW the THICK  black line on both rsi histogram indicators.

2. for long signals, arrow prints on price action and the white line  with GREEN histogram (rsi histogram indicator) MUST be ABOVE the thick  black line on both rsi histogram indicators.

Maybe it´s a possibility to filter out some bad trades for Ronnierott´s strategy. I have added a screenshot. I can post the indis etc. if somebody is interested.

Best regards!

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Please do so , why not .

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Good idea, thanks, I'll look into it. Could you be so kind and also post the thread/forum where you found this please.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Here are the indis, template etc. for that strategy. Maybe you can make use of it.

Hi Jubus,

Thanks for you great work on the EA,  I thought I could mess with the settings so that perhaps on a short time frame the EA could attempt may entry’s on a 5min chart in order to capture a longer trend, using your settings to adjust the stop along the way and take profit.

I have only tweaked it for the EURUSD and its been curved fitted for sure however the results look good [IMG]file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Barron/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif[/IMG]

at the moment I have it running on demo to see if it offers any promise.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
OK so far -600 pips for me. practically took back everything it gave me in two weeks and a half. Plus I have 3 more ongoing negative trades. I'm starting to have seriuos doubts about this strategy. I don't think I'll be trading with it next week any more. At least not with these parrameters. Unbelievably I've have no good trades this week, none, not even one single profitable trade on any pair.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
I think its been a tough week all round, with markets all over the place.  It makes trend following strats painful.

My thoughts were that if the week got any worse the DD would be too great, so I stopped trading at -300 this week.

Hoping for a return to normality next week.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Jubu,

How many pairs do you trade? I am testing on more than 20 pairs. I also lost 600 pips (it is so happened that the total lose added up just to 600 pips this morning) but with 30 closed trades. So, I can conclude that the EMAexit can reduce loss when the market went to the opposite. But haven't get any result for whether it will increase the profit pips. I will go on testing with the trend filter next week. I think this system is for strong trending market like last week. This week the market ranged a lot. It is bad for any trend following system not just Ronni's system. If we can find a good trend filter this system will rock

--- 帖子 #983 ---
So maybe Steve Hopwood´s Trend filter would be a good addition:

"I have included my favourite trend filter, given to me some time ago by   scooby-doo, a professional trader with years of experience: Rsi D1 20 period. There is a mtf Rsi attached. Rsi > 55: market is trending up. Rsi < 45: market is trending down. In between - market is ranging. If enabled, this filter will allow trading only during trending periods." It´s included in the Nicotina GJ Breakout strategy ea.

Best regards!

IMHO, An expert advisor WILL fail in making money consistently over a period of time, manual trading should always be preferred & i have always mentioned to post charts aggressively so that your entries & exits can be observed more carefully. what worked & why it worked ....

a known trader traded 5000 crossovers of ma's manually, many a times with frustation & anger but was persistent before he succeeded , he could have just assigned an EA & bingo ... i am not totally against EA & i understand it's role in eliminating emotions but it can't zoom to details like a human eye !!

why people in lawgirl's strategy make money consistently & the thread has crossed 1000 pages ?

think & then see for yourself what is the missing piece ... i read it like a bible not because i intend to start following it completely but to see how this method could be improved - as in adding filters.

i am currently trying to get hold of power adx or super adx which i have heard are impressive ... i feel adx should be a part of ronnie's strategy in some way as adx & trending market are inseparable, same experiment is already being done with rsi that you notice on my charts.

i will stick to ronnie's strategy no matter how many times i fail - 05/21/2011

Ok,

Here's the trades I took for w/e 20/05

16/05    E/U    -100

16/05    G/U    -100

20/05    G/J     Still in play, currently -22

Not the best of weeks I must admit.

Those using the EA on 24 hr mode and other pairings by the sounds of it were alot worse off.

Just to let everyone know, I trade this as per the first few posts.  ie, I only look for trades between 0600 - 1800 (London time) with E/U, G/U, G/J & U/CHF pairings.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
hi all

i suggest we keep pictures of all trades & upload as many setups & exits or loosing ones here so we can figure out where we went wrong & what could have been avoided.

once again aggressive posting of pictures will help all who are loosing !

those who depend solely on EA would definitely find it hard

i shall post whenever i can

Hi all. Here are the results for the last 3 weeks from the 5 minute chart experiment. I'm hoping the attached excel doc will display.......

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Hi all,

After a couple of months success on my trial accounts and a good years back testing on 6 pairs I have decided to go live.

Hawk I like your idea of posting screenshots, infact your screen shot shows the exact opening I took on USDCHF this morning.

I'd like to say thanks to ronnierott as well as this really does seem to be a very useful and successful strategy, I tried the EA's on here and while I got profit on the back tests I did not see it making trades where I would of personally so I gave it a miss. Would only use something if I fully understand it.

Currently I have 4 active trades all in the red. The worst being USDCHF at -50 pips. From my own tests of this method I have seen the trades run from profit to loss the n back to profit, if left totally alone and by following Ron IRS rules on the first post to the letter I have gained net profit over periods of months.

The last 2 months and the back tests equated to an average profit of about 140 pips a week naturally this is an average and some weeks have been very "lossy"!

Anyway I look forward to testing this strat with you all!

Hi Elovv,

I have added a spread for longs input. I just want to wait for Jubu to say it's ok to post it. Is that ok Jubu?

Also, I want to use the EA on the 15 min chart using the settings Ronnie suggested on page 12 of this thread. If I had a 1hr chart open with the EA on, and also a separate 15m chart of the same instrument open with the EA on would this work ok or would there be conflict?

Thanks Ronnie for your system.

Jimmy

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Hi Jimmy

Thanks for adding spread. I think it would be conflict if the EA on 15 min and 1 hour have the same magic number. If it whas possible to set different magic number in EA settings, then I think You could trade the same pair on fifferent timeframes.

Elovv

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Yeah that's what I thought as well.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
I know I said I wouldn't update the EA any more until you did those tests, but let's face it, I don't think you're ever gonna do them, so... never mind.

I added a kind of Support/Resistance option for both the EA and Indi(for visual confirmation). And custom Magic Number so you can use the EA on more time frames of the same pair at the same time by changing it.

S/R Inputs and how it works:
UseSR = false; // ON/OFF Switch

CountedCandles = 100; // How many candles back should the filter take into account.

DistanceFromSR = 5; // How many pips from the last High/Low should the Order be placed.

MagicNumber = 123; // Well it's obvious what this is.

Let's take for example a long trend(or a long trade on a flat trend). The filter counts the last high for as many candles back as the CountedCandles input holds and considers the highest high as resistance, so if a signal appears it will be placed at the DistanceFromSR number of pips above that highest high(considering that to be the resistance). Same goes for short trades, only difference is it counts the lowest low and considers it support.

Try the Indi and you will visually see what I mean.

I did not add spread because I do not consider it necessary. The spread is the brokers money. If you really want it to be and even score you can subtract it from the Stop Loss. So for example if the spread is 10 on a pair and you what to lose exactly 100 pips you just set the Stop Loss to 100-10=90 and there you go. Or you could add the spread to the winning side, so Take Profit + Spread and leave the Stop Loss alone, whichever way you want. It's that simple.

Thanks for understanding.

You have the files attached to this post.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Thanks for your continued effort Jubu. People don't want the spread to be added for short trades, only long trades. The reason for this is because all the candle information printed by MT4 on your screen uses the lowest price of the spread. Hence if you dont add the spread for long trades you will get stopped out earlier than 'expected' (the value of the spread) which I'm sure you understand. The solution you gave would work, however to provide this function for myself I simply changed the external int DistanceOfOrder into 2 seperate external double functions: DistanceOfOrderLong and DistanceOfOrderShort.

Then in all the BUYSTOP code I substituted the variable DistanceOfOrder for DistanceOfOrderLong, and in all the SELLSTOP code i substituted the variable DistanceOfOrder for DistanceOfOrderShort.

Now when I load the EA onto my chart I have the option to change the DistanceOfOrder on both long and short trades. So on EU for example where my spread is 1.6pips I enter 10 for DistanceOfOrderShort but I enter 11.6 for DistanceOfOrderLong.

I have had the latest version of the EA on 15M chart E/U, G/U and U/C (for settings see Ronnies post on p12 of this thread). I have also had it on 1hr charts E/U, G/U, U/C, GJ. Only trading between 06:00 and 18:00 GMT. The below results are for this week just finished.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
If you trade the pairs that Ronnie suggests only during the times he suggests then the average profit will be what he suggests it is

(180 pips per week average). It seems to me that after that week where everyone had a few losses in a row everyone doubted the system. For one thing some of the losses were on pairs that Ronnie doesnt even trade and at times he doesn't trade.

Even for a system that has a proven win rate of 70% (which is very good) it will definately at some point have a run of 3 losses and more. This is just a statistical certainty. In order to see if a system has an edge it takes many trades to analyse (at least 100 consistant trades, nore like 1000 and above, following the same rules). As the Ronnie system trades on the 1hr time frame this will take a long time (longer than this thread has been going) to do live trading.

That is why Ronnie back tested it and gave the figures he did. For me 180 pips average a week is awesome and a much better return on investment than any bank can give you. What needs improving? If you want more than that then it will be a different system - not the one that Ronnie has given. For me the system that Ronnie has given doesn't need improving.

I don't know Ronnie, but I have no doubt that he is still happily trading his original pairs at the original times slowly growing his account (as I know other people are also). Runs of losses will come but overall the average will be profitable.

As with every other system - as soon as it has consecutive losses people think that it is flawed, when in fact that is just a statistical certainty.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
If you have taken over 50 consistant trades can you post the results please? Were these using only the 4 pairs that Ronnie uses at the same times as Ronnie as well?

Thanks

Hi Hawk,

I havent been posting results as I am not testing this system at the moment. This is because I am trading my live account for which I use different trading techniques to the Ronnie strategy.

I would be really interested to know if Ronnie is still using his strategy - Ronnie?

How are you doing Hawk? Any improvements made?

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
I think this strategy can work for some, I prefer trading longer terms like gold "Investing" or some other ways of trading

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Hello all,

Well it's been a long time from posting here.  The thread started to go a bit negative so I stood aside for a while.

Anyway, in answer to peoples questions, yes I am still trading this system although I have incorporated a few additions to the strategy...... Those being Daily & Weekly pivot points etc etc.

So basically I am incorporating a fair bit of technical analysis as opposed to relying purely on indicators.

Glad to see that there is still interest in this thread and who knows, it may even get back to how it was.

I was very impressed when I came across this system. But as usual, many times, systems are started and the owner of the system either gives up or the system has so many modifications, the whole system changes. But, this system has not changed much and if Ronnie can come, it will be great. Is there any way that the Forex Factory people can contact the moderator?

We can try and keep this going and it is a useful and simple system. Please, Please do not add any more indicators or modifications, the system looks good enough as it is.

Hi

Thanks for the reply. But why the TP and SL is amlost 1:1? Dont you think, with this, we have to be right more than 60% to make little profit?

The method looks impressive but 50 to 50 TP and SL, puts pressure to win most of the trades to be profitable.

What is your advise?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Hi,

Agree with you on the RR forexnubie. My understanding is that the set-up is giving you sufficient edge, i.e. identifying good trend. Nonetheless, I will demo trade and post set-ups here.

Ronnierott, if you are still around, I would be happy to hear your modifications to the system.

My trade so far for the week:

GBPJPY: +100 p

GBPUSD:+100 p

GBPUSD: BE, currently at +43 p

Will post the trades later.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Second gbpusd trade stopped out at BE. Just realized that I shouldn't have entered on GBPJPY as low of the setup bar was lower than 30 p from M15. Here the chart of the GBPUSD trades.

1) tp:sl - 1:1 is fine .. how many times have you seen market moved a few pips in your favor and then reversed .. i have tried trailing stoplosses & breakeven already, both lead to pre mature profit taking though risk is minimised to great extent .. with this strategy if one gets very disciplined .. you will carve your space !

2) you will be right more than 60 % of times, less trades more profit entries.

3) no pressure, set it .. forget it .. close terminal .. go shopping.

regards.

2) on a H1, you can easily capture 50 pips with this strategy more than 60 % of the times

OK, cool, wasn't prying into you're personal circumstances, sorry if it came across this way.

I was just trying to figure out your level of confidence with this method.

Are you using the EA or taking manual trades?

Do you or Ronnie have any stats from your length of time trading this way.  As in number of trades taken, win/loss ratio, effectiveness in a ranging market?

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
lost & gained back

manual. i do not believe in EA for trading a system, i use them for risk management only.

i had explorer attached which showed consistent profit, now it's hard to maintain an explorer since my broker doesn't permits holding a demo account for more than a month.

it is not effective in ranging markets but if you trade it during peak hours of trading & on particular days of the week, you may be a part of the trending market. no one can predict if market is trending or ranging. you can only react to it.

i am waiting for your charts by the way !

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
....thanks Hawk, yeh I think the priority is to focus on the heavily trending markets with this method.

Would be nice to get an indication from Ronnie himself on how this has been performing for him.

have a good weekend

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Hi to whoever is still around, Ronnie thank you for sharing your 1 hour strategy...I really like the simplicity of this strategy.

JuBu, thank you for your tireless efforts in creating the EA..

Hawk, thanks for trying to keep this thread going..

Thanks to all who have worked to improve on this strategy, I feel that too many cooks spoiled the soup. Ronnies original strategy is quite good in identifying Breakouts in the 1 hour charts (USD/JPY works better in 4 hour).

I do hope that the few who are still using this strategy are still around

Thanks to all

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
Hi All!

Can anyone update with their results sofar? Does anyone still use this strategy?

I was wondering with the Risk Reward ratio.

Has anyone ever thought about hedging the trade between -20 pips with the same lot the moment the trade goes against you after 20pips? and close the hedge position the moment it goes back to the initial trade to TP. This way, if the initial trade hit its -100 SL, the hedge will at least cover full -80Pips and we only lost -20pips for the trade.

Then again, If the Hedge position goes back to the initial position, we close the -20pips hedge position and win 80Pips instead of 100Pip.

This would mean, 1:4 RiskReward Ratio.

Any take on that?

Another Open Long for AUD/USD. I open buy limit on last night before I sleep (Asia time). It's active on morning so I late to post.

Now, I protect my trade at 5 Pip and let other profit run.

Another Open Short for today. USD/JPY. I open Short position after last candle close. Wish me luck.

Update AUD/USD, I already close and take profit but Stop loss USOIL.

Hi,

Could someone please help me set up the MACD?

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Ronnie, I don't know if you are still keeping tabs on these thread, but I hope that you do, because I have a question

Can you use the EA for M15 timeframe? If yes, what parameters I need to change and what are your recommendations

Thanks.

Hey Ronnie,

Firstly, Thanks for sharing this awesome system. Secondly, I was wondering if instead of the 100 pip SL / TP you could manage the trade as it goes along using a combination of Fibonacci and momentum to manage the trade? You could possibly exit at peaks and let it retrace back to the channel and look for re-entry options? What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
This is actually a good strategy just back tested it i do around 50 pip stop 100 pip tp

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
if you enter a trade that's within all the rules, then after a while the MACD cross over or starts to move sideways should you exit the trade?

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
No.... Stay in the trade.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Hi, is this working on crypto? I dont know how to set-up the macd on built in indicator on tradingview

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Is anybody still using this system manually or with the EA successfully?

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Not yet... starting 2day.... from my point of view an awesome system because this guy has described the details U only get in hours when U optimise such a system like the distance=gap ema18 to the ema 55 channel....

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Stoploss 100 pips =1*atr(14)

Takeprofit 100 pips=1*atr(14)

Go to breakeven when +50=0.5*atr(14)

DO NOT TRADE WHEN THE 15 EMA IS INSIDE OR VERY CLOSE TO THE 50 EMA CHANNELS
I would try with 1*atr(14) distance ema18 and ema 55 channel.... letz see the results

Atr is just a pain... nearly 2 times as big as minimum... for me i never used it... so will use to simulate the channel width for trading...

sl/tp: channel width(about 2 times bigger than original)

breakeven: half channel width(about 2 times bigger than original)

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Gives winners if it is the last retracement 4-5 candles before the reversal... that is very cool.... and of course seems to make money... but just a first look after 1 hours coding and 2 hour fitting the settings....
