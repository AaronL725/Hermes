HI FRIENDS I AM NOT A FOREX BRAIN TO GIVE YOU A 100% PROFIT SYSTEM I FOUND THIS SYSETM IN ANOTHER FORUM WHICH GIVES 90% PROFIT AND NOW I CHANGED THE SYSTEM NAME TO SRS PREMIUM PROFIT SYSTEM AND SORRY FOR THE DEVELOPER FOR CHANGING HIS SYSTEM NAME AND POSTING WITHOUT HIS/HER KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM: TRADE ONLY IN 30 MINS TIME FRAME VIEW 4 HOUR FOR PROPER ENTRY AND EXIT NO TRADE IN 10 TO 15 MIN BEFORE NEWS RULES: BUY TRADES : 1&gt; WAIT FOR CHANGE IN CANDLE COLOUR TO BLUE 2&gt; CHECK THE SIGNAL INDICATOR FOR TREND i.e FROM H1 SHOLUD TO BE BLUE (IF EVERYTHING IS BLUE THAT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD PROFIT) 3&gt; CHECK ALSO THE ArrZZX2 INDICATOR FOR S/R LEVEL 4&gt; LOOK AT THE FIRST CANDLE TO CLOSE ABOVE KIJUN SEN INDICATOR PERIOD 24 LINES 5&gt; WAIT FOR THE DYNAMIC ARROW TO CONFORM YOUR TRADE A confirmed arrow means, when the candle above the arrow has closed and the arrow below that candle is still there. Dont enter before the candle has closed because the arrow could also disappears again,, wait for the candle to close ;;;;;;;; THIS MEANS A CONFORM BUY TRADE when it is closed and the long arrow is still there below the candle and also all criteria is met the profit factor is 90% now Don't forget to set at breakeven as soon as possible to protect your balance .. Maybe after 15-20 pips in profit. EXIT CAN BE EXECUTED WITH A TRAILING STOP ADVISABLE T/P OF 20+PIPS OPPOSITE FOR SELL TRADE EXIT SEE HERE http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...69#post7693869 GREEN PIPS TO TRADERS I Am not responsible for your money .. practice in demo first then go to live HINT : Always use pending orders for trade to trigger. keep pending order below breakout point of the previous low for sell and above previous high for buy . .

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I ALREADY MENTIONED IT MAN SORRY FOR THE DEVELOPER FOR CHANGING HIS SYSTEM NAME AND POSTING WITHOUT HIS/HER KNOWLEDGE SINCE I AM PROFITABLE WITH THIS SYSTEM I JUST STARTED THIS THREAD TO SHARE SINCE SHARING IS CARING ACCORDING TO SONIC

--- 帖子 #16 ---
thank you for the system. Will test it out. But the histo indicator is not there.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanks for sharing! Could you post a screen shot showing the indicators on your template? The tpl is not setting up right on my mt4 and the heiken_ashiH_sw_mtf has errors and won't show on my charts.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Definitively not!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
nice system Raj, quite easy to be used, combined some more indicators, would be awesome and more profitable...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
t/p hit eurjpy and gbpusd

--- 帖子 #21 ---
i missed one indicator .. sorry dude .... its here

--- 帖子 #22 ---
i think you got it now .. i posted the missed indicator and updated the needed one download it now from post one and see the attached image now

--- 帖子 #23 ---
updated now with all possible indicators and with new template

--- 帖子 #24 ---
welcome man if you find some more indicators and which can be used for this system for profit booking you can share and care

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi rajkumar, what is the purpose of the MACD STR EMA ? since u r not referring it to ur entries and exit ?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
its just a conformation part of enties and exit .. i use both macd str ema and mtf heiken ashi for trend i.e trade with higher time frames ...entry and exit with lower time frame or exit can be made with yello cross but it takes time so i use all these setups for my conformation thats it

--- 帖子 #27 ---
right now 70 members viewing this system

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Han ji raj, ArrZZ is repainting indi ofcourse!?!? it looks to good in histoy :-) Sasa

--- 帖子 #29 ---
So how do u determine exits with the EMA STR AND MACD ? plus from past history i cant see all a single column of the MTF that has the same colour &gt;.&lt; so isit a MUST indicator ?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...31#post7693431

--- 帖子 #31 ---
according to the rules mentioned you just enter ...on that time u will defenitely see same colours if its a good entry and see the macd str and ema lower time frames for opposite signals .. i mainly see in 5 min and 15 min in both heiken ashi and signal indi ..if the trend colour changes in any two blocks or so .. i just close the order very simple and also dont forget to trail your stops .. use these indicators just as a signals thats it

--- 帖子 #32 ---
ofcourse man ... i use it for stops and tp..... it shows s/r zones

--- 帖子 #33 ---
see post 8 for colours and entry and see post 9 for exit

--- 帖子 #34 ---
But i can see before hit tp pair hit to SL on GBPUSDM30

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Drawn. Looks interesting Next week demo

--- 帖子 #36 ---
@ rajkumar3192 - For how long do you trading this system?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
may be for more than 2 or 3 months with profit of almost 70 t0 80%.... trying to achive 90% so sharing and caring FF traders also

--- 帖子 #38 ---
2 or 3 month, you do not know exactly? Could you post picture of your equity curve? regards

--- 帖子 #39 ---
ah i got the way of how this system works thanks guys !

--- 帖子 #40 ---
sorry man i used so many system in demo .... so i cant give a proper equity curve ,,,,,..... for past 3 week result with change in lots from 0.01 to 0.50 see the pic ... practice makes a man perfect .. stick to one system and you will reach it... best of luck

--- 帖子 #41 ---
welcome and enjoy trading

--- 帖子 #42 ---
found another profitable indicator for this system in FF thread .. will test it and will share it

--- 帖子 #43 ---
You don't have to prove anything here. You are sharing a system freely ... If traders want to know how it is profitable for them, they have to do their job by testing it. Only commercial tools have to be backed up with proof ...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
indeed.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
exactly true,,,

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Raj, try to combine with these 2 nice indicators. I think it would be awesome...

--- 帖子 #47 ---
will test it

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Raj.. Thank You for sharing the system. BTW, Why you need extra indicators if you are already doing 80-90% with this system.. Just make money man..

--- 帖子 #49 ---
cool man just for more conformation more confidence thats it dude to make it simple

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Raj. , in seperate window MTF heiken ashi show 4 timeframe 5,15,h1,h4 what is the fifth row indicate which tf?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
i am not sure about that indicator last row ..and i am not a developer.. i downloaded it in one of the thread in FF ONLY . i see only 4 lines till h4 and see signal indi thats it man .. i just use it only because we are using heiken bars in chart so heiken indi will be powerfull for viewing higher time frames ,,and signal bars for exits soon

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Does all the boxes in signal indi have to be red for a sell and blue for a buy ? is the like a minimum amount of boxes to turn into their respective colours for buy/sell

--- 帖子 #53 ---
just use signal indicator for exit see lower time frames means m5 and m15 for exit .. since we are using heiken bars its difficult to see the change in trend soon so use signal bars for exit .. an alert will be given in the system if you have a possible entry in 30 min time frame .. so no need of stress in entrying a trade .. so much of indicators used is just to exit only .. i am testing an indicator for exit a trade will post it soon after testing it.. regards Raj

--- 帖子 #54 ---
exit can be made in so many steps 1&gt; wait for candle colour change 2&gt;when yellow x occurs 3&gt;when oposite signal occurs i.e arrow 4&gt;when s/r zones formed (indicator repaints) 5&gt;when signal indicator lower time frame gives opposite signal i am also using all these steps and also trailing my stop entering a trade is simple but exiting with positive pips is much important ..

--- 帖子 #55 ---
U say entry signal is easy, so let me restate the rules again 1. blue candle 2. clsoe above kijusen 3. dynamic arrows shows a buy signal. thus signal indicator is for exit only ? i am very confused with ur rules .

--- 帖子 #56 ---
check rules no 2 . it says check signal indicator H1 blue or red

--- 帖子 #57 ---
u r right ... when u trade u also see alert poping up........... it occured when all the rules are made i think u r clear now

--- 帖子 #58 ---
ok , so what is the heiken ashi MTF for ?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
conformation man .. keep it simple ... so much of indicator in the system is just for conformation only we are using heiken bars in main chart and using heiken mtf indicator will help you to find the trend .. while using this system you will know it.... as alert is given for entry .. we are safe.but alert is not given for exit ... will be waiting for some developer to do that ... so exit statergy is little risk now . thats why i use more indicator for exit a trade ... .. i think so much of exit will be given by FF members .. .. when exit statery is fixed will remove unnecessary indicators .. i already mentioned that in post 1 regarding change in rules are welcome .. system is in testing mode .. but in testing itself it gives profit man .....

--- 帖子 #60 ---
hi raj thanks for your system.i see the indicator CCFP does not appear in my chart at all.can you please show the setting for that indicator here? thanks fred

--- 帖子 #61 ---
reduce "X_offset_comments" in the indicator settings

--- 帖子 #62 ---

--- 帖子 #67 ---
t/p hit no prob regarding news for me started monday with profit

--- 帖子 #68 ---
If the indicator is showing mtf from other time frames wouldn't that mean it repaints because it takes time for the lower time frame to catch up to the higher and it can change by then?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
which indicator signal indi or heiken mtf

--- 帖子 #70 ---
thank you for the system.how to set stop less for each trade??

--- 帖子 #71 ---
where is repainting .. singnal indi changes all the time .. its because of 3 indicators attached ... .. see the pic below for proper entry

--- 帖子 #72 ---
since the trend is conformed .. so i keep it on s/r area or the previous kijunsen consolidation area .. make sure which is near one use that one .. some times it hits sl if u are not aware of news or u r unluck .. but 80% it wont hit sl regards RAJ

--- 帖子 #73 ---

--- 帖子 #89 ---
How do you use this dashboard?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
by seeing this dash board i can tell that the price action is moving up and right now m1 and m5 are retracing the price but still the price moves up ..am i right

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Yes you are right but do you take a signal from it like it needs to be fully red or fully blue.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
It's more for confirmation ...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
not fully red or blue .. it depends upon your trend .. i already mentioned it if it is fully red or blue you will get a good profit .. its just a suggestion

--- 帖子 #94 ---
locked another 20 dollars .. my trading time over .. its enough today ...

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Which of the indicators shows the arrow? And does the arrow repaints?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
hi Raj what is the proper SL for this system? what pairs you use it for? thanks fred

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Raj good morning) what time you start work

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi All, i am a new member here and just bump to this thread. i am sooo excited to use this method!!! hope to hear more from Raj!!!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
dynamic gains indicator shows arrow.. . once the candle closes. the arrow will not disappear ..... on the moving candle the arrow will dissapear but once the candle closes it remains .. i rules itself i mentioned that .. on the next candle you enter if all the rules met ..

--- 帖子 #100 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...83#post7695583 see this link for sl . and mainly i trade eurusd,gbpusd,usdchf,eurjpy,usdjpy,euraud.... i dint test it on most .. i think it may work in all pairs .....

--- 帖子 #101 ---
isd 9 or 10

--- 帖子 #102 ---
welcome man .. stick with one system and use proper rules of the system so you can also achive .. but takes times to achive .. try try and try tilll you achive ... green pips to you

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Raj its great system.its already make some green pips.i have one question regarding the trailing stop. if we put 20 pips TP. for example 20 pips SL. is it correct to do 20 pips or higher trailing stop? or trailing stop could be 15 or 10 pips too ? thanks alot again regards fred

--- 帖子 #104 ---
its according to your money management .. see post 72 for sl.... .. if i trail the stop i mostly trail BE after 20 pips and if i see any consolidation in trade i close and book my profit .. thats it ... or keep the tp 1 pip above or below the s/r zones and trail according to your wish ..... green pips to you

--- 帖子 #105 ---
thank you, it is very useful to take profit, especially combined with nihilist.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi rajkumar3192 just a quick question MTF Heiken Ashi indicator window: 4 timeframes, 5 lines, is the fifth line for daily? or i am missing something? thank you for sharing Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #107 ---
t/p hit on gbpusd which was taken a counter trend trade and gold t/p hit today started with nice green pips

--- 帖子 #108 ---
i already mentioned it man just read the thread

--- 帖子 #109 ---
nice trade .. with just a little risk

--- 帖子 #110 ---
okay dude.i will look into this thread and also stick to this system

--- 帖子 #111 ---
yep, had done that before posting and did it again in case i missed it, it isn't mentioned anywhere. no problem, works anyways, thank you for your efforts again cheers

--- 帖子 #112 ---
The fifth line, i.e., bottom line is nothing but the mirror of the top line (240 mins line ) with colors inversed. Not needed practically. Only the developer of the indicator should be able to say why he/she has incorporated into the indicator.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
i am asking about system

--- 帖子 #114 ---
euraud tp hit again 70$$ oh my god started this trade in morning ended right now

--- 帖子 #115 ---
see post 1 for system

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I was short on EA too. got 19 pips. Watch GA. It has good ADR. Thank You for the system buddy. Bluejack

--- 帖子 #117 ---
welcome and happy trading with green pips regards RAJ

--- 帖子 #118 ---
does ARZZZ repaints ?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
usdjpy tp hit again

--- 帖子 #120 ---
s and it shows onlty support and resistance so no prob

--- 帖子 #121 ---
The rules of the system ( to be clearer for new comers ) Long 1. Dynamic arrow appear BELOW candle. 2. Candle close ABOVE Kijun sen 3. BELOW the Dynamic arrow , there should be a ARZZx2 support. 4. HA MTF is just for gauging the momentum only. ( better to have at least 3/4 blue square at entry) 5. Signal Bar showing MACD EMA STR is just for gauging the momentum too. Opposite for short ! Below are examples of entries and exits. Note to Owner of thread: Kijun sen is abit redundant. entry with ARZZx2 and Dynamic would be good enough from the trades i have.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
so isit yes or no?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks Rajkumar, What is the Daily Open Line &amp; PivotT for ? About Signal Indicator, we just need to see the H1 signal ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #125 ---
nice that you find a good entry with ARZZX2 AND DYNAMIC .. thanks for it .. will test it tomorrow ... and thanks for your intention regarding this system and you are welcome

--- 帖子 #126 ---
eurcad manually closed my trade high risk .. but achived .. thats it for today

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Please RAj, charts showing your trades with defined entry, stoploss and exits will increase learning curve. Thanks for the system

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Raj is it arrow appearance not enough for buy or sell? because alot of times arrow come up but price far away from kijiun-sen line. regards fred

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Good point The only thing I wonder is the ARZZx2's appearance. Sometime it repaints, but when it becomes solid, how many ARZZx2 we need to entry? At least 2? Looks good so far. Nice work, Raj. Oh by the way, what's the name of the indicator showing buy/sell suggestion? I can't find it in template, or how to set that? Thanks

--- 帖子 #130 ---
The arrow apperance is almost same as colour change of the HA candles 85% of the time. So, filter is needed to minimise false moves and increase strike rate.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Since ARZZx2 repaints, I know I should monitor PA in many TFs before entry. If I may add another indicator, this one might be helpful to confirm entry position. Explanation as described in the screenshot. But overall, system is great.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thank you Trend indicator!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Your welcome. I use this system as my trading basis template now, combined with other solid indicators, so I will have solid entry and make another green pips. Personally, I only entry whenever arrzx2 appears with trend lines are crossing over. That can be used for both entry and exit point.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Its the file name CCF_DIFFLEV, it is included in the templates and indicator file ! thanks for ur trend indicator too!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
There is no fixed number of how many arzz arrows need to appeaar , lets say u saw arzz forming with 2 arrows only , so the bias is towards bearish side, now u look for good oppotunity to enter short by looking for MTF HA for around 3 - 4 red boxes(MUST), Signal bar needs to red for 5mins column to 1 hour column , if signal bar is blue for 4h and 1min , its totally fine to enter the trade. Opposite for entering LONG . Take profit at the next ARZZ LINE BE IT SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
daily oprn lines denotes the start of the day if the price is up or down it will above the daily open lines and below for bearish trend .. since we are trading with trend we have to know about s/r lines and pivot line for tp .. so i provided with pivot lines ....when higher signal coincidice with lower time frfame enter the trade and book profit thats y signal indicator is used

--- 帖子 #137 ---
since you are trading with price action you have to trade with trend .. lets take if the price is going up so all rules met and arrow formed below the candle and kijun sen line is up so u enter the trade .. pice will not move always in a straight line .. it always retrace some point .. so a red candle formed now... and arrow appeared in that time i will close and book the profit .. and wait for the bear trend to settle and enter again .. in case if you are familier with system you can also trade with counter trend and take some pips .. while trading with counter trend see the pivot ans s/r lines and trade .. . so lot of arrow depends on the trend .. its not only the signal as soon as arrow comes you enter the trade ..... i think you understood the arrow function in the system

--- 帖子 #138 ---
thank you nofirumi for the indicator ..... and thanks for your review about the system

--- 帖子 #139 ---
the indicator name is dynamic grains... .. download it from post 1 . when ARZZx2 apperance is done it denotes a strong s/r zones with a trend reversal is going to happen .. i mainly open a small lot and keep it till the trend changes and close it with some green pips and after retracement open a good position in the trend and gain more pips see all the screenshots i updated with ARZZx2 .. and thanks for the system review man you are welcome ...

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Ouch, 1 thing for sure, do not entry 15-30 minutes before high impact news. SL got hit on N/U 'coz I saw solid resistance then suddenly went up No Raj, i meant the other indicator what Jason said : ccfp_diff, the one showing buy/sell suggestion. How to manage so the suggestions appear?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
i used default settings and the pairs just appear. by the way , this system give quite alot of false signals or late entrys. my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #142 ---
that's why i added Trend indicator, i think better on 4H TF...

--- 帖子 #143 ---
s you are right higher the time frame more green pips ... i am also using your trend indicator now great results with it thanks nofirumi

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Your welcome, mate It has multi functions, entry and exit points, strength and also the trend itself. Just add 0 level to the TREND indicator to make it better. But your Pivot indicator is also great

--- 帖子 #145 ---
thanks and you are welcome as you say i think h4 works better now .. by seeing h4 trend i enterde in m15 and now within 10 mins its in profit now ... really trand indicator helps very well

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Where do we add the zero

--- 帖子 #147 ---
The support and resistant indicator appears late when the price has taken off several candles, making it too late to enter. How can one tackle this problem?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
setting the trend indicator properties, click LEVELS and then add 0 (zero) level there

--- 帖子 #149 ---
after s/r indicator appears wait and trade in the trend .. we cant able to take all possible moves .. even after s/r resistance there will be a consolidation so it may hit your s/l .. so always trade with trend and dont be greedy my friend . see the image nothing we missed .. we only gained green pips ..

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks man

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks for your lucid reply, my friend

--- 帖子 #152 ---
So that chart is 15mins or 4 hours ? So whats the new rules ? Nofirumi stated that this system is better to be used on 4h chart.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
higher the time frame higher the profit .. lower time frame high risk.. its up to you to trade .. i trade 30 mins and some time with small lot i trade with h4 .. but h4 seems good with trend indicator.. right now.. or else see h4 for trend and entry in 15 mins its up too you so your stops will be less . and profit will be booked soon....

--- 帖子 #154 ---
you are welcome .. my friend

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Due to my present commitment, i will be testing out 4hr time frame. my plan is to wait for an establish move with the resistant indicator then enter on a pull back signal with the arrow.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
again with green pips yesterday ....

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hey rajkumar3192, on average how well are you trading with your system, e.g. how much % are you making per week/month if you don't mind me asking?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
my target is i have to take 100 dollars per day.. it depends upon the trading time .. i wont see my system daily .. so i also open some trades with long term and let it run for some days like i posted in post 116. but when i start a day will some good pips i achive more or less 50 to 100 dollars a day .. i am also making this system quite simple now .. will change the system soon with less indicators ... and with acurate point of entry and exit ... and once i achive profit daily .. as i said .. i will post it here

--- 帖子 #171 ---
how you trade this?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
i cant understand what u had written in the image

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Yer it seems like your system is doing well, have had one or two trades with it but haven't used it in earnst yet, but if it works for you I might adapt to it. Seems like it doesn't follow so much the trend but reversals or breakouts as such from S/R or Fibs?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
i am trading this system with a modified version ... as i told i will publish it soon in this forum .... and this will help you to take a good trade soon ..

--- 帖子 #175 ---

Yes, you give proof and also live trading post, that your system is well proven. Nice work

--- 帖子 #202 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #203 ---
And where is USD/JPY?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
its still running on ..

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi rajkumar bro i want to ask you why you changed and added indicators just asking a question you did it because the old template was not profitable or what? just asking.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
since everyone was telling that the system is not profitable in 30 min tf and they are not entering the trade at perfect time .. so i changed it to 15 min with less indicator .. thats it .. if you trade in any one template you wil achive .succes .. . first template with higher time frame gives high pips and second one with 15 mins gives high pips thats it.. now it depends upon your trading style

--- 帖子 #207 ---
sl hit its because of me i dint trail the stop .. i opened the trade and went .. this trade should to be closed in yellow cross ..

--- 帖子 #208 ---
i think you got the ans now.. 4 tp and 1 sl .. as i told 90% profit according to system ... this sl is also near to BE so no prob .. little loss gives you a boost

--- 帖子 #209 ---
i think the old system is very good if anyone understand it properly week target reached in one day on the last day of the week

--- 帖子 #210 ---
higher the time frame higher the pips ... excellent work carry on ...

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I have been looking at this for the last few days and found it to be a great system (haven't made it to the modified yet) even with news events it still has some great feedback. See below on UJ I wanted to share, just got out of the trade at the top of the hour. The red arrow is where i entered price . Thanks Raj Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #212 ---
you are welcome and nice to here that you are getting green pips in srs system

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I will take a $20 profit trade any day of the week!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hi.....how many pairs do you trade and tp and sl level...??

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I am trading the big three GU, EU, and UJ I am trading some of these on nadex and have a plugin for stop loss and also profit value. Because i am new on this system i am not "letting it ride". so on that last chart my SL was just above at the high of the bar i placed it there right after the close of the bar (which i would not suggest doing all the time) with the red arrow and my take profit was $20US or right about where the light gray line was (whenever it hit $20). Let me know if that helps

--- 帖子 #217 ---
got it thanks for the reply it really helps.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
okay live demo trade i entered right at the green arrow for a sell. &lt;&lt;&lt;DEMO ACCOUNT&gt;&gt;&gt; With system (before indicator changes don't know the new indicators yet) I am thinking of an extra rule/suggestion: for a sell it must hit or cross back above the white line (Kijun) and all H1's and M30's red to get in, for a buy it must hit or go below the white bar (Kijun) and H1's must be blue and M30's must as well. there needs to be some movement for this to work though we will see for this one it's late in the day. again a DEMO ACCOUNT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #234 ---
follow up on the trade a closer view on the chart i went in at 2:00pm EST and got out at 4:45pm EST red arrow, kind of the end of the session day. I think i should have waited to enter the trade for the H1's to all be red this was not a large trade at all and no volume in the late afternoon. Still a profit though Attached Image (click to enlarge)

swimmax best time to trade during Volatility.us and london.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
See the higher time frames are telling long .. You are doing a counter trend trade ... But you had taken a good trade in opposite direction .. The entry and exit and perfect ... But try to trade in london market ..so you will get a nice move ....

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Raj, how do you get out of the deal?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Means you are asking me about the exiting the trade

--- 帖子 #239 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #240 ---
1-first fix the tp and SL .. Then trail the SL ( its your wish .it depends upon your money management)2- move to lesser time frame and wait till the x cross to occur That's it simple

--- 帖子 #241 ---
if the deal goes negative, as to leave

--- 帖子 #242 ---
No if your entry is correct means I am telling you about the rules mainly trend ... You will be in profit .. If u r in counter trend ... See the smaller time frames and exit soon ..but for counter trend also .. Rules should to be met in other way

--- 帖子 #243 ---
where you put SL?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
see post 1 if SL suits you or put it in swing high or swing low it depends upon the long or short trade ... But place a trade only if all the rules met .... Then green pips will definitely follow you ...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
BE

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Agreed, that is why it was on my demo account would not trade it on a real money account. Working on the entry and exit point during low volume or slow session.

If you guys do not mind, Duggerss can post his rules here in Russian and I'll translate them into English (besides&gt; I suspect there are quite a few Ruussian speakers following this Forum and thread, so rulesin Russian may come as handy for them and help avoid any possible ambiguities). Thanks

a good morning trade just followed price action. sold at the red arrow looking to see it go to S1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Rules of my trading strategy 1. Waiting for the opening of London 2. Waiting for the signal arrows 3. Look where the candle closed relative to the indicator Kijun-sen 4. Look trend indicator 5. Look indicator HA higher timeframes example 1: opened London green up arrow next, we need to know to take it or not take 1. Candle closed below the indicator Kijun-sen (the signal does not take) 2. The indicator trend bearish mood (the signal does not take) 3. ON the indicator HA there are red cubes (the signal does not take) example 2: got a red arrow down next, we need to know to take it or not take 1. Candle closed below the indicator Kijun-sen (the signal does take) 2. The indicator trend bearish mood (the signal does take) 3. ON the indicator HA all the red cubes (the signal does take)

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Duggerss, here is the negative example just to see if I understand it correctly...would you take this trade(white line Sell)?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
all right, only time not working

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thank you for your replies.. What is your stop loss and profit target?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
With my modified version of this system with trades mostly on the 4hr chart, the result have been very good. If not that i am occupied during the day cant check the hourly chart, it should have been a harvest of pips this week and previous weeks. I can only check the horly when i return in the eving and its asian session mainly and then just scan the charts for a good set up. I Do not want to exagarate it much for now as there is some aspect i need to work on to achieve my goal. My main plan is to increase my account at least 5% each week and for the past three weeks, that has been the case and even morethan. When i have time i will be droping in some chart set ups and my trades taken.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
A 4hr EURUSD trade i took this week 20014/09/23. the trade is still on closing half position on 1:1 and currently +152 pips. The vertical line is the entry point. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another one i took 09/16. Vertical line is entry, exited at bottom candle of the purple line plucking about 170 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #362 ---
There are so other many ones that i might have time to post. somehow i will be posting my intended trades and taken trades in the future

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Esosa, thanks! KIndly please share your template too so we can test all. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
according to my system higher the time frames higher the pips ...its sure ...... Congrats nice trade ...

--- 帖子 #365 ---
nice report ....looks really awesome .. But be sure you keep the SL near so in case you are trading against it will protect you ..there will be only less loss ... ..its really nice to see a report like this ... Well done and may green pips Leeds you ...

--- 帖子 #366 ---
nice entry .. Rules met properly ....

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Yes i will do so when i get to my station. But the indicators are common to get, i just took them on different thread here and there to fine tune the system. Primarily the indis for my decision are tdi, dynamic gains and the fisher indi coupled with basic PA knowledge(demand and supply).

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thats very true man. system still in development

--- 帖子 #369 ---
pls update soon .... With proper rules ...

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I will do so soon my friend, even if not complete so that others might make necessary adjustment to fit their style of trading. It is not just mechanical, so a bit of discreation is applied especially basic knowledege about trend, pullbacks, demand and supply zones. To also enhance profit curve, TDI trading method skill should also be learned somehow. There is a popular thread for that here called trading made simple started by late eefranz. With these basic things, it should be relatively easy. Coming back soon.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
will be waiting for your reply

--- 帖子 #372 ---
The same technique can also be applied to daily candles for more relaxed trading. As opposed to general myth that says that start with higher time frame, i will advise to start with 4hr then when the eyes have been properly trained to identify good or high proberbility setups, then the higher and smaller time frames will just be traded naturally withouth hitches. This is because the daily candle takes more time and patience and not good for a novice to learn with more setups. But with 4hr, there are more scenieros were one can learn. I must beg for pardon for not posting anything concrete yet, just wana be sure that the method is good for trading. Yes, no method have a 100% strike rate but wanto make sure this method can produce morethan 100% account increase annually and then i can be confident in posting the full details. one thing gives me confident though, and that is the fact that even with the TDI alone many traders make a living from it and the has been in existence for years now. Keep the thread alive

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Just heads up, the chart below is the GPBUSD daily, if the market open without no Gap, will set stop order at low of the candle with the arrow and take profit at 1R:1R. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I observed that your dynamic gains indicator repaints. how do you determine the correct entry point since it repaints

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Dynamic gains does not repaint. if the candle bar is closed with the arrow still on the candle, then the arrow stays there. But if the bar is still forming, th e arrow can appear and dissapear. So you wait for a candle to close. Only the fisher and ARzzx2 indi repaints.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Have been in this trade since last week. Two positions opened, closed the first at 50pips(1R:1R), closed the second today for 152 pips. Total position 1R:2.5R. First horizontal line entry, second exit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #377 ---
s u r right once the candle finishes the arrow will be there ..in forming candle only the arrow repaints ..I also mentioned about this indicator in the first post itself

This week has been kinda crazy but still up with 1% with an open 4hr trade. The daily trade entered are been tested separately.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Closed 1st position at 1R:1R and the second position currently at +123. I will still hold on to this as the outlook seem good to me technically. Entered GBPJPY yersterday candle and closed it for +100 due to the fact that it is siting on a support line. There is a tendency that the support wont hold but just wanna take it all out before otherwise happens. Entered two positions on the Ausie and GBPCAD, let see how these go.

Hi Duggerss and every ones, can you tell me the signification of RgH and RgL on the Market Panel display controller?? Thanks JP

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hello Esosa, can you please share your template with us? It seems you have some optimized settings for H4. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Jb, i think that Rgh And Rgl indicate the adr of the pair. Sp if the price move too near to that. you need to be cautious as it may reverse.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
good example of waiting until the trade passes a support or resistance. UJ right now. it triggered on the M30 but pulled back because of the R1 it was on. Waiting for this to play out a bit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Duggerss, thanks for providing such a complete picture of your trading! Very high % winning ratio, as rajkumar has experienced. From the record attached to post #356, [including at least 45 minutes prior to opening the first trade for starting to watch for trades] 9/22 --- 15:07 – 20:06 [~ 6 hours] --- 5 trades (3 trades simultaneously) 9/23 --- 10:30 – 12:41 [~ 3 hours] --- 4 trades (3 trades simultaneously) 9/24 --- 10:30 – 13:41 [~ 4 hours] --- 6 trades (5 trades simultaneously) 9/25 --- 13:30 – 19:10 [~ 7 hours] --- 9 trades (5 trades simultaneously) 9/26 --- 14:05 – 15:28 [~ 2.5 hours] --- 3 trades (3 trades simultaneously) so it appears you found a trade, on average, about every hour or less? I assume this (this high win ratio and about a trade per hour of actively watching market) has been typical of your experience since then too?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
HI, Am new to trading and this forum here. How to integrate this system in MT4 can any one help me. Thanks

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Rajaji If you search for the thread called "Installing indicators + templates on MT4 " you will see a video posted by Shabs 19 which explains how you can load the indicators, such as those referred to on this thread, onto the MT4 platform. This highlights that the platform has been updated and the method of loading the indicators has changed slightly. Good luck

Hi Radji, you follow just momentum trent or you look and global.?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
i put my orders what higher time frames tells

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Can you make screens of full your trading. with all signals and all timeframes

--- 帖子 #444 ---
the same i am posting dude .. nothing more complicated in my trading also . the same screens i am posting before is the one i use . i trade on m30 by seeing h4 time frames . if all time frames matches you are in good profit

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I understand correctly, you look at H4 at the same strategy and if trand up you just buy on m 30

--- 帖子 #446 ---
beffore buying on m30 check the lower time frames . also for quick profit so you can move your stoploss to BE

--- 帖子 #447 ---
you changed so many indicators, so maybe you should restate the rules again and update the indis so that we can follow

--- 帖子 #448 ---
i am using the same indicators only added nihilist ultra trend indicator

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hey Radj you say this system give you 90% winning setups, now you have 10 loose threads(

--- 帖子 #451 ---
i just added my demo account and finding a new strategy for my system thats why . my running trade right now i think its clear now

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Raj...what indicator you look at in H4 to decide direction of trend?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
check the signal indicator on top

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Is there way an email can be sent when the Arrow comes up on the chart or when the Alert pop screen shows the confirmed Entry? I have been testing the system out and it is amazing. i just wish it cold notify me by email whenever the entry is confirmed on the alert pop up alert?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
yes if any coders willing to do it .. it will be useful for every one in this forum

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I am trying to get this system coded into an EA or least get it to send a email when the confirmation pops up

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hello rajkumar, In the first post on page 1, there are set of indis and rules that you stated which include multi shi indi. But on another page you stated different rules with different indicators with TDI included. Which of the set of rules are we to follow and which indicator? Do you still use the mtf Helen ashi, or the TDi indi?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
still now i am using mtf heiken ashi at 30mins only . in case if i want to scalp then i will move to that tdi indicator . but mostly i used to trade in mtf heiken ashi only esosa

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thanks for your replies. Probably the last question:I have noticed a regular pattern in the mtf heiken ahi which almost gives 90% accuracy( but don't know if it will be so in life market condition because its an mtf indi). What are the signal you look for in the mtf hieken ahi? so that I can see if they agree with my observation or not.A chart illustration will be appreciated

--- 帖子 #464 ---

Hi Rajk How long have you been using this strategy?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Rajkumar! I wish to use your strategy, i have already installed the template into my MT4. But i do not understand clearly your entry and exit points. Could you please show me some pictures with your enrty points? Thank you for your helpful hints in advance!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
1. check what higher time frames says ( follow the trend) 2.wait for arrow to appear above the candle for sell and below the candle to buy ( arrow should with stand after the candle close ) 3. check the pivot , support and resistance levels .price should should to be at least 10pips 4.check kijun sen , for sell price below the kijun sen . buy above the kujin sen. 5. finally check any news dont trade 10 mins before or after red news thats it

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi Rajkumar Thanks a lot. When you check the trend in higher time frame which one do you use? H1, H4 or both? All the bars should be red or blue?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
i always chose what h4 says when you get a proper signal in m30 that time u will be having 80-90% all in same colors

--- 帖子 #483 ---

Raj, Very nice System. Well done on your contribution and thanks for it. You shared this when you used it for 2 months and i am assuming you are still using this system. I spent a lot of time understanding this and now am so comfortable, i opened trades directly and made a clean pips. Following rules, which are simple. Sticking to rules is important for success with any system. I have been using Ichimoku, and now i feel your system looks very nice. Regards Chandra

--- 帖子 #522 ---
i use so many systems but i have a live account running by this system now and its works fine ... its good that you to getting profit with the system .. since there is no interest in the thread by traders i decide not to make this thread active . so not posting any charts till now

--- 帖子 #523 ---
So what other systems do you use Raj.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
i use my srs system right now in my main live account and testing some systems demo .right now my next fav system is almos 5/15 mis system. since its more or less same to my system .. and he uses to respect support and resistance trading .. i am testing it also now

--- 帖子 #525 ---
some of the trades of today going good .... this system works fine but no one is willing to participate in this system ... its up to the traders now. to do their home work

--- 帖子 #526 ---
till now booked

--- 帖子 #527 ---
got short on gbpnzd and running almost 300 pips waiting for my target to achive ..

--- 帖子 #528 ---
today till now feeling blessed

--- 帖子 #529 ---
very nice. well done raj. This is nice system. slow and steady. News is the main issue. Is there any news indicator which you can place on the system to give an early warning.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Raj, Which broker do you use. you seem to be getting very good spreads and also no commission and swaps even on a position you opened on Friday.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
i dint use any major indicator for early warning . i use only the indicators that is present on the system and basic knowledge of price action for where to enter and where to exit .. in case if i find useful to add an indicator in the system i will share it here example see the attached image below .. 1.we know that price is in strong sell 2. check for rules (1st trede taken near the pivot and ended up almost near s2 for max of 80 pips 3. we know that price retracement after a strong move 4. keep the pending order with sl on top of the lower high +5 to 8 pips 5. keep tp 50 to 100 pips in example if you see after breaking yellow line price went almost 160 pips( blue box) i booked almost 100 pips and closed the trade so total of 180 pips in a pair is a good trade

--- 帖子 #532 ---
which broker do you use.

sure jakepujia some of the trades done today regards RAJ

--- 帖子 #541 ---
this is one of the best system but no one cares about it . so the thread became dead . everyone wants to get profit but they wont do their work properly. lets say one thing clear i am doing my live trades for more than 2 years now and been quite profitable everyone likes to trade the indicator but not the price so they lose their profits and blame the system and they move on to another system. so they miss a good system . according to me indicators are just reference for your system and to form rules thats it .pls dont trade by indicators try to learn charts . they are the one which gives me profit. follow the rules and i am sure you will be get profit with this system. .as always good systems will be found in recycle bin

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Raj First thanks for your system...But to be honest l have tried it for a while and l didn't make it...You are right people jump from one system to another really quickly... Don't get me wrong...l don't want to criticized or offended you...Just give an opinion from a newbie with your system... Of course for you rules are crystal clear and easy.. but for someone not familiar to your system l think it was not clear enough the way you put it post 1 despite your efforts... May l suggest you do a little video with all steps from the beginning on how you look for good setups... Also as we cannot stay all day long in front of the chart waiting for setups...When we see it it is often too late...That happened often to me... It could be good for us to see how you manage your way and not staying all day long sticked to your computer. and having success with your system.. And believe me...If people finally get it you will have a lot of followers... Thanks

--- 帖子 #543 ---
thanks for your review . i really appreciate you for your reply.. i will try to do an video if time is available. and lets make it clear i wont stare at my computer all the day. some rules i maintain in my trade i only trade some pairs which moves faster and gives me a decent amount of pips. i always keep pending order depend upon h4 time frame and trail my stops accordingly that it.. i kept it more simple once my daily target achieved i close it and move on ..

--- 帖子 #544 ---
This chart shows my 30 pips successful trade with this system. Thanks for the system Raj. By the way, I just want to state what I am looking for in order to pull the trigger is first and foremost ARROW(Up or Down) and then when I see strong momentum on the candle in which arrow is attached, I wait for the candle to close and enter in the next candle. And of course, I make sure that Kijunsen is above the price for SELL and vice versa. I hope I don't miss any required info that I have to look for in order to have a successful and profitable trade with this system. If I have any, kindly let me know guys.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Best system out there. no dobut. I trade today and my stats: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not recommend play GBP/CHF pair. it blow earnings twice..

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Great start.. Keep it up.. I wish green pips follows you

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi investor25 Really want to believe you... May l ask how do you filter your trades? l have experienced a lot of false signal... ok for the arrow but for what l saw it is often a false... ok for above below/above kinjun-sen but often the move was half-way done or almost done... So what else then...don't see it...Probably miss something... So far nobody seems to use the other indic provided...it is why l have asked to Raj to enlight us with more details about his entries... Thanks for your help anyway

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Why belive. I'm first that provide good results in this thread? Rajkumar said it all. It working if you practice a lot. Just improve you skills and be patient. It will be some loss big trades. I more looking on H1, H4 - then I looking on R/S. Then waiting that price hit R/S and then if dynamic gains show/price break kijun sen I enter trade with trend. I also looking on arZZx2. It's pure price action - quick entry, quick take. I'm just thinking about Stop loss couse it has 85%&gt; accurency but one bad entry could blow earnings. so still figure out.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
done for the day with nfp also .. its a good weekend

Dear Rajkumar, could bo explain how do you setup Stop loss in your trading? High or low? Risky or just closing manually?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
well done . post your charts too . let help others to improve in this system

--- 帖子 #557 ---
i keep stop loss at previous high +10 pips and trail my stop to be at 30 pips and i start managing the trades

--- 帖子 #558 ---
i just follow the rules and make profit ...

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Ofcourse, this is one of the best systems. I think Raj mentioned somewhere on post1 - 90% Success rate with this one. Use rules, there is also an alert in the system, which indicates confirmed buy or sell. As suggested 30 min timeframe is good. Higher timeframes are good as well. For me, I use Alerts, and take trades either in Morning (london opening) or afternoon NY open session. As with any system, spending time in understanding the system and respecting rules will win. Like any good trader- you need to use a system which works best for you. and get confirmation from multiple indicators. Do not take trades on one indicator ever, it is too risky. Confirmations are very important. Do not use this system to do scalping, As it repaints only after the candle is closed. And avoid during news events. NFP on 8th July - friday was exception, as US jobs was as expected on positive note, it went with the trend. Raj, I see in your new charts, you have at top left hand side, TP &amp; SL pips. is that a new indicator you added onto this.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
no .. its not an indicator its an expert adviser for managing trades

Good Job. You opened trade without SL ?

# MTF_Heiken_Ashi serious redraw the indicators! Be careful!

--- 帖子 #572 ---
i dont use this indicator

--- 帖子 #573 ---
i too took off that and added rsioma (2) and it looks good. if want means i added

--- 帖子 #574 ---
how do you use this indicator . can you describe your entry and exit with a chat

--- 帖子 #575 ---
this arrzzx2.ex4 too not showing proper arrows.. once the blue arrow displays and disappear.. after that marked with arrow candle it displayed and line of arrows .... but not at the right time

--- 帖子 #576 ---
sure here above 80 and below 20.. once the blue thick line enters into 20 means sell trend and price getting lower lows... above 80 means higher highs.. but crossing the level from 20 towards up for buy 80 below cross comes to sell ... cross over the violet line too take for more filter on seeing the 2nd pic... when the blue thick line into 80 crossing above the price strongly goes to highs.. once it gets down.. price falls for short..

--- 帖子 #577 ---
well described ... will check this too

--- 帖子 #578 ---
just now noticed... when price comes down then only 5 to 6 candle back the x mark comes... so how it is to be used?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
ramzam .. great question .. what i see is this is just an indicator which repaints. i always check for a major trend and support and resistance area before taking the trade . and wait for the trend to assume and check for the system rules and enter .. if all these rules are met sure you will be in profit.. check the past trades also ..

--- 帖子 #580 ---
yes thats right... but never behind this arrow indicator alone.... agreed

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I use a template and the index released at the beginning of the article you are!

--- 帖子 #582 ---
NO issues.. but some changes will give more fine.. some time more flop

--- 帖子 #583 ---
ArZZ needs to show near the entry point, or we need just to use it as S/R levels?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
once arzz indicators plots and arrow and gets stable the trend has been changed use it as a trend indicator dont trade against it

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Thank you for the fast reply and the system. Going to start testing it out in following days.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
great ... post your profit and loss trades too. i will help you

hi rajkumar, thanks a lot for the thread. How do you know when not to trade with this system? as an example: today most of the currencies were flat, and on demo i had losses, how i can not fall into such traps. thanks.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi rajkumar, thank you very much for the awesome system, I've been very profitable every single day using your strategy$$$$$... I've been having issues with the EMMAM1 signal since I first downloaded the template, the signal is frozen with the same number of 1.32882 and the same red and blue lights in all the different currency charts, is it possible to get that working again?

HI Rajkumar3192! I am a beginner in Forex, registered specifically to provide feedback on this thread. I feel a little difficulty in terms of entry into the market. Re-read the entire thread, the inputs are described accurately, but as a newbie confronted with the problem of late entry. Someone has already suggested you to record a short video on how you enter a transaction. The system is very profitable, if at first to catch the trend. Did you enter pending orders? or the market price? The variant can show screenshots 5 immediately before you open the transaction (which is something like this: now the market looks like this ... and in a moment the following screen: now with warrants) In any case, thanks for a working system! Regards, Gennady

--- 帖子 #590 ---
hi Rajkumar3192, I would like to thank you for sharing your trading system. I'm trying to understand your SRS Premium System, however I don't see CCp-Diff_[v2.0] on the chart. The Expert tab, show an error. do you by any chance have a working CCp-Diff indicator working? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Rename the indicator name as shown in expert tab and re apply the same template. Rrgards Decent

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Working Well SRS Premium System Hi Rajkumar, why stopped ???? I tested and works well.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hallo traders, I'm using this system now for a while, and results are good so far. I have one annoying issue with this setup: By changing timeframes it plays an annoying sound file. It has to come from "Dynamic Gains 1" Indicator. Anybody knows how to deactivate, please post here. Thank you

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Guys, I have been using this system recently and am quite successful. Please lets all come back and keep this thread alive. I want to begin to see comments and contributions from now please.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi to all, Just want to ask, if the "Trend" indicator starts to intercept each other after the arrow indicator has appear, do I still buy EUR/USD as shown in the attachment?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Yes that is correct. I have noticed that the 2 lines on the Trend indicator intersects whenever the "DYNAMIC GAINS" arrow forms. The trend indicator is the life of this strategy for me. Make sure to follow basic TMS rules for red and blue line (Good angle, exit once flat). I've also noticed that if you want to trade the trend you can do so as long as the red or blue line is above the "0" dotted line. Once it comes back down and gets close to the "0" line it's time to exit.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
is anyone here pls make this thread ALIVE

--- 帖子 #598 ---
i think this system still profitable, let's make this thread keep alive.. I will try to post every profit and loss with this system so, this is my first live trading with this system Attached Image (click to enlarge)
