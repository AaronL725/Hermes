Hello Traders! When Spudfyre generously gave his time to developing his original thread on Multiple Time Frame (MTF) Stochastics, I stayed with it while he mentored each and every one of us on the specific details of his methods. No doubt, MTF Stochastics, with experience, can be a terrific method of trading. Spud was a great teacher and mentor, but he has sadly vanished from the scene. Hopefully he will return one day, but until he does, I'd like to continue to learn as much as I can. And, believe, me, I still have a great deal to learn. His original thread (suggested reading) can be found here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=22105 So, I've decided to start this brand new thread, devoted exclusively to The Art of Trading with MTF Stochastics . The specific purpose of this thread will be to help us learn not only the basics, but the more subtle nuances of the MTF Stochastic methodology, so that we can all become better, more efficient -- and successful -- traders. It is my desire to maintain more of a "purist" group, not so involved in cluttering up our screens with endless auto-pilots and mechanical indicators (except, of course, for the more common basic pivot points, Fibs, S&amp;R lines, and perhaps a few MA's) so that we can concentrate on seriously honing our trading skills and learning how to utilize and/or integrate MTF Stochastics effectively (if not exclusively), in order to add many more pips to our daily diets. Let's share our MTFS trades, explain what worked for us (or didn't!), how we set up our charts, how we identify a proper setup, what to look for, and so on. I would like to make it clear that I am NOT a long-time forex trader, and definitely NOT an expert. I'm just very interested in this methodology, and I want to refine my skills as much as possible, while sharing my experiences with others. I invite you all to please feel free to ask questions and contribute your knowledge whenever you can. Thanks!

Hi all, One of my biggest problems with this technique (I think) is that it is very rare when I can actually find a really good MTFS setup. So, I tend to trade on "nearly" good setups (bad, I know). My results have been mixed, of course. I trade mostly GBPUSD, EURUSD and EURJPY since spreads are pretty small on these pairs, and I trade mornings, EST on the east coast in NY. And I usually trade the shorter time frames, like 5m/15/30. Now, just a little while ago I came upon a great setup, took the trade and made a quick 20 pips while I was posting this thread! Funny how things work out... But, I wonder if any of you trade other pairs that setup better for MTFS, or if you find that some other times may offer more opportunities. Thanks!

http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e3...d10172007b.gif This is how I trade. Use H4 Stoch to find the trend. If the trend is uphill, I go LONG only. It's one-way trading. Vice versa for a downtrend. Now the problem is the StochBars indi doesn't refresh. So I have to use two H4 Stoch windows. Edit: So how do you set up your way to find a trend?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Banzai, Thanks for posting your chart. I see you enter as the stoch turns up, but is there a specific exact point at which you enter? Your charts do not seem to indicate the stoch levels, so I'm wondering what gets you in. Also, would you please explain your two lower windows (with the jagged stochs and colored bars)? What do they tell you? Thanks much!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
^^ Well, I enter LONG if %K crosses up %D but %D has to be under 50. Notice %D and not the other one. That's why you see level 50 in my Stoch (5,3,3) indi window. I make less money in 1-way trading but it's safer for me. In live trading, it happens very fast and I don't have a fast reflex to react quickly. The jagged Stoch window is H4 Stoch (14,3,3). That's my short term trend. The blue line should be %K and the red line should be %D. Since %K crosses up %D, that's an uptrend and I just go LONG only. The StochBars is the same as the other H4 Stoch (14,3,3) window. Green is an uptrend, red is a downtrend. It's just another way to save window space.

Well I found the thread by spydfire a while ago. I have used this method already when I was trading stocks many years ago. But thanks to the great people here some great indicators has been made to be placed easy in a chart (BarStoch) and is much easier to use in the forextrading. The trading is as simple as it gets. I trade the 15m period, daytrading, and all i want is the 15m, 30m and the 1h stochBar to all turn green or red. The 4h stoch will just give som "larger" guidance on trend and power. On GU I usually go for 15 pips if trading against 4h trend, and 20 pips if with the 4h trend. The problem: The stochbars "updates"/repaints larger timeframes if they are about to change direction. This means a signal could suddenly appear 3 bars ago, and that sucks, cause often the ride is already over. Or even worse, a signal was good 4 bars ago and then suddenly the 1H stoch repaints and then the signal 4 bars ago was no signal.. Often you're behind like 18 pips when this happens and havo no other choice than bail the trade. Indicator is this : http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&amp;postcount=14 Now.. the MTF stochs works like this if I understand it right. This is on a 15m chart.. the 15M stoch will always be correct, the 30M stoch calculate on every XX:00 and XX:30 and 1H stoch calculates on each hour bar..etc.. How do you think our MTF Stochs would perform if they were based on bars and not time? Again.. 15M chart, 30M stoch would calculate on the last two bars, not just 12:00 -&gt;12:30, 12:30 -&gt; 13:00 but on bars so that it will be 12:00-&gt;12:30 and on next 15M bar it would be 12:15-&gt;12:45. The same for the 1H stoch that would need the last 4 bars for calculation, 12:00-&gt;13:00 and on next 15M bar it would be 12:15-&gt;13:15. This way larger timeframe Stochbars would not repaint and we would always have a "fresh" stoch on all our timeframes. I hope you all understand what I'm getting at.. anyone that could program a MTF stoch like this?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
^^ Me too. I was about to talk about the repaint problem. I'm not a very good programmer so I don't know how to fix this problem. Hmm.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Okay, Now I understand. The crossing of k over/under D is an interesting approach. I assume it's successful for you. So, you watch the 4H and trade the 15M? Thanks for taking the time to explain. Here, I have multiple monitors: dual 19" on my PC, and a very large screen on my Mac. On the PC I have three separate windows set up for each of three different pairs (9 windows total). I have a separate stoch indicator (and fibs) in each little window, and they are set individually to 15M, 30M and 1H, for each pair I watch. So, I am able to glance at my monitors and see three different stochs for each pair I trade. Gives me a good quick visual of possilbe setups. On the Mac, I watch 5M, 30M &amp; 1H, but just for one pair. I also run a few different indicators including levels (pivot, S &amp; R), plus several MA's, including 50 SMA, to indicate the longer trend. I've never found the 4H stoch to tell me anything. Of course, I could be wrong, and poerhaps I should start watching it more closely. I take my trades through the MAC, and utilize the extra space for email, browsing, and other things I might be doing. Thanks!

Hi Frankie, Welcome aboard! You would be much better off just watching the simple curves of different TF stochs. They are more natural and the curves reveal much more than red or green colors are able to. You can get an indicator or a template that will display multiple time frame stochs in one window, from the original thread. I prefer to keep this thread on topic, so I would ask that requests for programming or programming fixes please be posted on one of the many other available threads (including Spud's original thread) where entire communities of excellent programmers will be more than willing to assist you. I appreciate your cooperation. Do you use the 5.3.3 or 14.3.3 settings? I have been using 14.3.3, but have recently started to watch the 5.3.3 and I think the latter is a better indicator. Thanks so much for sharing you method!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Banzai, To answer your question, I wait until all three windows show the stochs moving in the same direction, all below 76.4 heading down for short, up past 23.6 for long. For more reliability, I like to see the stochs pass at least another step closer to the other side (61.8 or 38.2). I won't generally trade into a fib line or S &amp; R line. That's it!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I think I should, at this point, clarify that I have no problem with folks using indicators on their charts, and asking others for help with their indicators. I have and use many indicators myself, and am a serious electronics geek with far too many computers, too much radio equipment and other questionable gadgets, so believe me when I tell you -- I understand. Nevertheless, the reason I started this thread was to break away from the original thread which had, in my opinion, become so cluttered with layers of indicators, programming codes and EA fixes, that human interaction relating to trading with MTF Stochastics seems to have taken a back seat. I simply don't want that to happen here. The intention of this thread is to create an interactive environment where the focus in on -- The Trade . And if I'm unable to keep us on track, it will surely see a quick demise. Thanks for understanding!

This is my favourite MTF stochastic trade - the rubber band trade. When the daily stochastic is oversold (or overbought) I wait for the hourly stochastic to get to the other extreme. I use price action to enter (I don't wait for the hourly stochs to turn) &amp; target half or two thirds of the trade at the first support or recent low &amp; trail a stop on the remainder. I aim for a risk reward ratio of 2 or better on the first portion of the trade. Six possible trades are shown on the chart below. Trade 1 would have been stopped out &amp; I wouldn't have taken 4 because of the time of day. Trades 2,3, 5 &amp; 6 would have delivered pips.

I've used MTF stochastics as my primary "indicator" for awhile, and was glad to see spud post his thread awhile back as it spurred enough interest for a few good indicators to be written. I combine MTF stochastics, daily pivot/S/R levels, MACD, and RSI as confirmation. Basically what I'm looking for is to pick the daily high and/or low near a S/R level, I need to see stochs on the 5/15/30/60M all overbought/oversold, a weakening/strengthinging MACD, and RSI coming off a high or low. Here's a chart from Oct 15 on EURJPY to give you an idea of how I trade: GREEN BOX: R2 level at 167.65. I don't get in right away at this level, but watch price action in this zone. There is a triple top, which tells me that level should hold BLUE BOX: 5/15/30/60M stochastics all overbought, and turning down on the triple top. I got in at the doubletop at 167.60 MACD: Notice the "weakening" in MACD. The top peak was before the first test of R2, then the next lower peak was on the doubletop (my entry). When price came back a third time, MACD had already turned/weakened so I consider that confirmation. RSI: I don't rely on RSI, but like to see it on the right side of my trade, in this case heading south. *** The only other thing I do is to look at the price levels of correlated pairs. When trading any YEN cross, I make sure the others are all exhibiting the same MTF stochastics and preferrably near a pivot/S/R level as well. Regarding exits, I use fib retracement levels as my exit levels OR other S/R levels. I target 38.2 to scale off 1/2 my position, fib50 for 1/4 and 61.8 for remaining 1/4 position. However, I am able to manage my trades all day so I can alter my exit strategies based on what I see the market doing. This strategy works well for me, and I primarily trade the majors with it. When you can pick a daily top/bottom on a good volume pair such as EURJPY, you have a lot of room to work with. EX if the daily range of EY is 150 pips, then my exit targets are 57 pips (fib38.2), 75 pips (fib50), and 93 pips (fib 61.8).

Here is what I see right now on EURJPY. Price action at the 165 level is consolidating, MTF stochastics are all oversold, MACD is turning up, and RSI is strengthening. Since price is in between pivot (165.44) and S1 (164.43) I am only taking a half position. USDJPY is right at S2 (115.55) which is good confirmation. My entry is at 164.92, I'm placing my stop at fairly tight at 164.72-67 with my target level at 165.40 just inside the daily pivot (and fib50 is sitting on the pivot). Hence I'm risking 20-25 pips to gain 40ish...a 1:2 risk:reward ratio Again this isn't an ideal entry because price isn't at a S/R level, but you can see my red dotted line which was strong resistance from yesterday. EDIT: 6:02am The other thing I don't like to see (as is the case right now) is the EURUSD is just tagged R3 (1.4310) all MTF stochs are oversold meaning there's going to be more short-term downward pressure on the EUR (at least in my opinion). I will target 20 pips for 1/2 my position (165.12), move my stop to BE if this happens, with final target of 165.40 for the remaining 1/2)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
As I manage my open positions, I watch price action in the form of candlesticks. The attached screenshot shows major resistance in the 165.15-25 area. This is denoted by the long wicks of the candle on 5 consecutive 5M bars (25 minutes). Price keeps getting into this zone, finds resistance, then retraces back a bit. The way I read this is if this zone can be broken, we'll see price continuation upwards. Update on my trade...1st target of 165.12 hit for +20 on half my position, still targeting 165.40 unless I see otherwise

Hi Nitro, Thanks for joining us! And what a very smart way to trade! I'll have to look it over some more, but I like your mutli-faceted approach. Thanks for sharing. I'm watching the stochs come up now (it's 0934 here EDT) and will soon enter the trade myself if the move continues. More later...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Nitro -- Good observation, I also watch candlesticks. I'd like to see price climb up over the 38.2 fib before I jump in.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
My final target of 165.40 was hit so +20 on half, +48 on second half for a +34 pip average on the trade. This screenshot show a few things I was watching and updates from my earlier post: RED BOX: The resistance/rejection area I mentioned before RED ARROW: You'll see that price moved through this level with conviction (meaning on a healthy sized, full-bodied candle). BLUE ARROW: My exit. Watch for a bounce off this 164.40-45 level since the pivot/50 fib levels are there, and 5M stochs are turning down.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I entered at 165.37 with stochs 5M/15/30 at 50/50/27, all moving up. Price had crossed the 38.2 fib. Moved up up 4 pips but got stopped quickly at 165.22 for a loss of -15 pips!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Charlie, Thanks for joining us! Are you saying that if the daily stochastic is at one extreme, the hourly is likely to move to meet it from the other side? And, aside from price action, that's all there is to t?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
If your trade strategy is to wait for price to move through a major fib (like 38.2), and then target 61.8, just be mindful of the major S/R levels in between. Trading this way is "safer" because you are making an assumption that the daily low/high is in place in order to establish your fib levels. A lot of folks don't like to try and pick daily tops/bottoms. But on your trade, I see a few things working against you. You entered at 165.37 which was less than 10 pips from a the pivot acting as resistance. Also, the short-term 5M stoch was heavily overbought and due for a short term correction. Either wait for the 5M to make an oscillation, or enter after the pivot and fib50 was broken. Not a criticism, just my view for what it's worth. Since typing my post, price moved back down to the 165.00 level and turning back up. This is more validation that the 164.85 level will hold for the low of day (LOD)...I see it moving back up to the pivot again

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Nitro, Trust me, I am wide open for criticism! I appreciate your comments and couldn't agree more. I was aware of the pivot, but my stochs were showing good direction and the 38.2 fib had been crossed. The pivot was my mistake -- I should never ignore it! For some reason, my 5M had not turned as yet, so I felt the trade was going smoothly. My fibs are drawn automatically from the previous day's H/L based on GMT. Thanks very much for your input...

hey all , i use the original spuds way of stochastic to trade retracement , i trade gbp/jpy btw , i watch for large gap between 4h 5sma and new bar (retracement sma learned from brilliant auslancos thread) and then wait for 15m n 30m upcrosses the 20 level from bottom , enter my trade at 15m sma and catch a quick 30 - 50 pips , the trade can sometime be risky since its mostly against the trend , so u need to wait good setup on all time frames ... shall post a chart the next time i get such trade ...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
SCREENSHOT analysis of your trade: 1st RED LINE: Your entry...notice the 5M stoch in the red circle is high. 2nd RED LINE: A more optimal entry level since the 5M stochastic moved to 20 (green circle) and was turning back up. If you would have entered at this level (ex 165.00), now your 15 point stop is below the assumed LOD which is MUCH better support since that would be more difficult to break. Just my view.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Nitro, Your view is crystal clear. Yep, I jumped the gun. My bad. Thanks so much for taking the time to post an easy to read chart. Makes lots of sense. Much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Welcome maheswara, I look forward to seeing your charts!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yep, that is the basic set-up. If the daily stochastic is stuck at one extreme, it is an indication of a trending market. The set-up is a great way to enter on pullbacks in a trending market. When the hourly gets to the opposite extreme, and price action indicates exhaustion or rejection, there is a high probability that pullback will end allowing price &amp; the stochastic to revisit the lows (or highs). Spuds explanantion: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...93&amp;postcount=6 I have just modified the timeframes to suit what works for me. Take a look at the USDCAD chart from 10 Sept onwards, there are lots of set-ups.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi Charlie, Thanks for your explanation. I do recall reading Spud's description, but had completely forgotten about it! I like it and will give it a try -- looks almost too easy. I love it when Spud would say that something so good, it was "too boring." Charts appreciated, as always (I have to work on that myself)...

I mentioned in my earlier post that the EURUSD had tagged R3 and was expecting short term downward pressure for the rest of the day. This happened at the 12:50 GMT 5M candle. At the same time, the GBPUSD hit R2, broke through a by 5-10 pips, and had all the signals of my trading style (including confirmation with the EURUSD corralated pair at R3). The other major important factor GBPUSD had in it's favor was the 2.0500 physcological level (double 00's). I was in the EURJPY trade so didn't take this, but just wanted to show you that when tops/bottoms happen on one pair, they are almost happening on other correlated pairs. The move went down from 2.0510, consolidated at the 32.8 fib, broke through and now is finding its resistance at the R1/fib50 cluster. The trade would have been good for target1 (35 pips - 38.2fib) and target 2 (50 pips - R1/fib50 cluster). Here's the screenshot:

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I use 30M stoch as the trend signal when it crosses each other or 23.6 76.4 15m stochastic as entry point and exit point

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Jeff, Thanks again for starting this thread. We are coming out of the closet! Well, it seems that the original Spud is alive and active eventhough there are slight variations from the core...but each of us has to find what works based on our temperament and personal/financial goals. Here is my way: I look at three charts (vertical aligned), 1min/5min stoch, 15/30/60/240 stoch and 30/60/240/1440 all with 78.4/50.0/23.6 levels. I also have four ema's that follow the Cornflower method by Lever. I use these ma's to help me confirm a trend and its strength. I usually start looking at my charts at around 4:30 am est. The reason for this is that it keeps me from trading the London news (risky) but allows me to take advantage of the volatility that pound/yen offers until the London close. My target is 10-20 pips or more if possible. I trade basically the Escalator to Pips method. I use the one minute/5min stoch for fine tuning my entries and exits. I am always looking for the faster stoch to take off by itself so that I can enter when it springs back to the higher time frames. I am realizing as I type this post that so much is left out because trading is as much an art as it is a science. TA provides the palette and brushes but the non-verbal/subjective plays a crucial role before, during and after you complete a trade. The title of this thread is very appropiate... to become intimate with a currency pair is a moment by moment experience and the more you become familiar with a particular pair, the more you feel like you are tuned in. I have a love/hate relationship with the pound/yen....you need an incredible amount of patience regardless of your situation. If you are down, you have to endure the drops in pips and if you are up you have to fight the urge to exit prematurely. Either way the fear/greed factor plays tricks with your mind...where is Yoda? Spud also recommends the Pound/Yen. It lends itself to a harvesting 20-30 pips several times/per day. That fits me very well because my goal is to increase my lots instead of going for hundreds of pips at a time. Well, I apologize for this long post.... I'll leave the more technical contribution to our very qualified members of this forum. Spud... we miss you.

Hi Moneda, Welcome, and many thanks for your very kind words. And no need to apologize -- your wisdom and participation is always welcome! We've been extremely fortunate to have some very articulate members join us here (yourself included), and I've already experienced a great rush of knowledge, in just this first day! Personally, I suffer from all the flaws you mentioned: little tolerance for drawdowns, and always take my profits too soon. And, far too few winners! I'm a fair newbie to forex and, not unlike the experience of learning to play a musical instrument, it is taking me a while to learn the rudiments (much more time than I had anticipated, though), and it will take a while longer before I begin to develop my own personal style. But I'm workin' on it! Thanks for sharing your method with us. You watch a lot of charts, more than me. I keep 10/21/50 MA's on several charts, which I got from Phil Nel, for the same reason you watch Cornflower. Unfortunately, I played with CF for awhile but was not successful. However, the concept of retracement to the 8 or 10 ema seems universal, so the MA's definitely help clarify price action of the moment. Thanks again!

I very much enjoyed reading, and now using, Spud's escalator theory. I have only used it on the GBP/JPY, mostly because Spud did it that way, but now because of the volatility that always seems to be there, even when the other pairs are flat. I hate the large spread, 8 pips, but if things line up correctly, it becomes a non issue. I have found the s/r on the 1 hr and day charts to be very helpful in predicting a range of movement. I am unable to just enter a trade and then come back in 4 hrs or so and see how it is going. I have not yet been able to stay in a trade for the 1 hr stoch to go from 80 to 20 or vice versa. That means I always leave pips on the table. So the good news is that I have always pocketed at least 30 pips, usually 50 to 70, and on some occasions I have broken 100. I use the 5 min to time the entries/exits and I often exit and enter 2 or 3 times in 1 ride. I will watch the 5 and 15 for retraces and I will get out with my 20 or 25 on the initial move. I will then re-enter and ride down to the next "floor" when I see the retrace ending. I enter again for 15-25 and wait for the retrace to develop again. Usually 3 rides or floors is enough for me and will have me between 50-100 pips. I don't scalp on the retrace either. I just take a break and let my heart rate re-stabilize for the next ride, if it develops. So besides not riding things from top to bottom, I also burn some pips on the multiple trades. Still not an issue, when you look at the big picture. The 5,3,3 on any chart is a very good indicator of nearing a top or bottom and for me, an exit. The s/r on the 1 hr and the day will give you a very predictable range, which can be right on target or get smashed. If the range looks to be 100, then I am happy with my 50 or 60. Larger the range the better, obviously. For some reason, I only seem to be able to catch the down rides. Only 2 trades moving up and they were in the 30 pip range. Don't really know why that is. I do reference the mac-d for strength and duration of a move and the rsi in conjunction with the 5,3,3 stoch for a bottom or top. I look forward to learning from each of you.

Wow PipaV8tor sounds like you have a good thing going here. I would like to hear more and possibly see a chart with your strategy on it. I too want in... I followed Spud's teachings until he went on vacation, then I tried to find something easier or took less time. EASIER and Forex do not belong in the same sentence. I have tried several different stategies but they all are mostly "Fluff". The orginator tells of his great past and the present never measures up. So, I am back where I belong and look forward to learning together with you guys. T4K

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Guys, Thanks for joining in! I think we're all going to learn a lot here, lots of successful traders participating. Great to see!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Do you use a higher TF (like the 1 hour or day) to confirm you trend direction on stochastics prior to entering based on the 5 or 15 min. chart?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi PipAV8tor, An interesting -- if not heart-thumping -- approach to money management! Are you using only the 1H stoch for your entry? I realize you are also watching the macd &amp; rsi, but just the one stoch? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thank you Jeff for starting this new thread. I needed this to get me back on track. T4K

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Here's a quick question: Some of you are using 14,3,3, others 5,3,3. Spud's original concept called for 5,3,3 but then he changed it down the road. Can you share with us which inputs you prefer, and why? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
You're quite welcome -- I was feeling the same!

hello everyone. i personally use the theory (stochastic- rope / fish net) seems ok. but right now i ve been try to adapt it to daily time frame only.... i try to trade less but more pips in hand at the end of the month. i just blow my usd 300 account last month, just trading using this stoch...but i learn something. . i cant trade on lower time frame than daily/4hr .hehe. my time not permitted. i m going to combine the following for tf Daily &amp; 4hr 1. stochastic 30,10,10 &amp; stochastic theory(rope) 2. QQE 3. EMA 5(close) &amp; EMA 8(open) i ll post the chart later. right now, i m going back to demo acc, untill i get the consistent result, then i m going live again. my lesson... never play 1pip=1usd when your account balance is usd 300 play 1pip = 1cent @ 10cent for 300usd account.

PipAV8tor, Quote: have only used it on the GBP/JPY, mostly because Spud did it that way, but now because of the volatility that always seems to be there, even when the other pairs are flat. I hate the large spread, 8 pips, but if things line up correctly, it becomes a non issue. As far as I am concerned the Pound/Yen, if you can stomach it, is the best pair to use with SPud's method; it seems to follow the movement of the MTF Stoch very well. As far as your spread, with EFXGroup, I can get 2-4 pips spread + commission ($1.02 per trip/10,000 units)...so that comes out to be around 4-6 pips total....One standard lot is $5.96 per trip which makes it around 3.5-4 pips. You can check their thread and get more info. Jeff, I will be interested also in understanding the difference between 5.3.3 and 14.3.3 and its effectiveness. I knew very little about Stochastics and Spud is an expert on it.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I'm no expert, but here is my view Stochastics measures how high (or low) the most recent close is in relation to the range over the last n bars. n=5 will use the last 5 bars. n=14 will use the last 14 bars. 5 period will give a fast response, but could give more false signals. 14 period will give a slower response, but fewer false signals I prefer to use 14 on fast timescales (4hr &amp; below), and 5 period on a slow timescales (daily &amp; above). However, this is just personal preference, there is no right answer.

Hi Charlie, Great explanation! Believe it or not, I never really thought about what those numbers meant, butr now it makes some sense. Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Here is a chart showing difference between 5,3,3, &amp; 14,3,3 on GBPUSD H4 Notice how the quicker stochastic gives earlier signs of reversal in the blue boxes. I prefer the slower, smoother stoch on the 4 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Charlie, Thanks for posting your chart. I'd say the 14,3,3 seems a bit "safer" for me in general, as I usually trade the lower TF charts. Thank very much for taking the time...

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I am glad this thread was started and I think the intended purpose is great. My personal approach is to use 15/30/1hr/4hr timeframes, using the the 14.3.3.3 setup for GBP/JPY. I will typically wait untill they have crossed 30 or 70 depending on short vs long trade and use macd and RSI as further indicators. I have not yet traded using the elasticity approach. You can typically get 2-3 good trades a day on this setup for this pair. I have also used this on usd/cad and eur/jpy.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks Jeff for starting this thread. I've followed Spud's theories up until his vacation/hiatus. I really like his Thread Theory. For instance, just take a look at today's GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, and the AUD/USD 1HR charts. If you had traded the "peaks" (he explains this nicely in his Thread Theory) you would have made a nice day's pay. I also place a momentum indicator in the multi thread window. Wait for the peak to form in a overbought or oversold state, and you almost always will earn some pips. I have to see how to put up a chart. Take care and thanks again.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Here is the big thing about Forex in general you have to let the trade come to you, do not anticipate what the indicator will do, let the indicator do its job.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
So true Endroute. I get hurt only when I jump in before the Stochs reach overbought/oversold 76.4/23.6 areas and make that downward/upward peak. Not always, but often enough where I've learned patience to wait for the correct set-up. What's nice about the Multi-Threads is that you can look through many different currency charts and look for the set-up. And when you have the "rope", even better! Works well on the 1hr/4hr charts as per Spud's suggestion. Can also be used on the lower timeframes to look for retracements. The 30m chart also is very successful using this theory.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Evidently I missed the whole ROPE concept, I have tried to find it back in the orginal thread, but must have missed. Can someone clue me in? Thanks.

Has anyone tried spuds scalping approach as follows. I started looking at this the other day and then got side tracked, and built a chart to start looking at it and all I have to say is WOW what a PIP machine on 5/15 and GBP/JPY even with the spreads . MTF Scalp Direction : You need not worry what direction the long term trend is in for this method to work, it works regardless of long term trend direction. Time Frames: either: 5/15, 15/30, 30/1H, 1H/4H Entry: Set a level line on your 14,3,3 stochastic at 61.8 and 38.2. Your entry/exit is always with the smaller time frame. The smaller time frame should be one step (one candle) ahead of the longer time frame for the cross or one step behind...or exactly the same. This is optional if you are conservative and a common pattern. However, you do not want the longer time frame ahead more than one step of the shorter time frame. On a long, whenever both tf's cross or are above 61.8, buy long. On a short, whenever both tf's cross or are below 38.2 sell short. You can add greater risk if the longer time frame is "near" the cross in the direction of your trade. The longer tf should be across 50 level. This may prolong your trade and could add some risk. If you don't have this correlation of the 2 time frames, you don't have a trade. This is your filter mechanism. Exits: 1. If the shorter time frame goes above 80 on a long or below 20 on a short, you definitely want to be out before it re-crosses 80/20. 2. If you nab some pips within 3 candles on the shorter time frame, you may want to exit. 3. If the longer time frame is looking like it will go above 80 on a long or below 20 on a short you may want to ride it out. 4. If the trend is with your trade you may want to stick it out...use a trand channel. You will quickly notice an average pip gain, you may want to TP that. You need not worry what direction the long term trend is in for this method to work, it works regardless of long term trend direction.

Endroute, Just go to Spud's Stochastic Thread Theory (under subscribed threads) and he begins to demonstrate the "rope" theory in post #3. By the way, have you tried his Fibonacci Breakout Method. Another winner.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thank you I totally missed that thread. For anyone that wants a great read on ropes and missed the thread like I did go here. http://forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=37111 I have used the Breakout method with great success, though not as much as the scalping and shorter tf trades (fits my personality better)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Endroute, Thanks for the scalping tip. The one thing to keep in mind is that most of the time is better to stay out of scalping after the London Close especially between 1pm- 5pm est when volatility and spreads are not favorable. I have been using 1min/5min stoch to fine tune my entries/exits and sometimes I will enter a pullback of the 1min back to an oversold/overbought 5min. P.S: Using your method I found five shorts and two longs today with plenty of pips to harvest.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I have been a member of ff for nearly a year now and read ,studied and traded what seems like ever system here. This is the first post I've ever printed in all that time. Why now? Because i truely believe what your attempting to do on this thread, what you ARE doing on this thread could lead to GREAT success. I took a long time to learn what many vetern traders where trying to teach when they spoke of "finding your own personality or tolerance in trading" and "finding the style or system that fits who you are!" I finally found that in Proffesor Fryes thread. I was disapointed to see him go but was instantly inspired when i came across this thread. All of you have done a remarkable job at keeping the focus on the trading using his methods. I say all that to say this...this thread has that same spirit that spudfrye began his original thread with. It seems to me that the least anyone could do in return for his teachings is try to sustain that spirit until his return...and that is exactly what I see everyone here doing...and I would very much appreciate being allowed to be part of that. and remember: "it isn't how MANY times you when or lose, its how MUCH you win and how MUCH you lose" W.Buffet

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I'll try to answer all questions toward my post here and elaborate a little. Spuds main focus, as I recall, was the 4 hour chart, with preferably all 3 smaller time frames, 1 hr, 30 min and 15 min lining up. He did mention you could use 3 of the 4, it was OK but riskier. This would be the the 3 smaller charts bouncing back to the 4hr. More risk, less pip range, but a pretty predictable move if you are away from announcement times and several markets are open (prime time). There really isn't much to change that rubber band trend. I do not personally like that trade, but I have tried it. Maybe only a 1 floor ride though, take my 20 and get out. When I enter a trade( I'll describe a sell/short), I use what the 1 hr is telling me, but I make the move on the 15, using the 5 for more precise timing. The 5 will help me see the cross coming on the 15. The best scenario is for the 15 to cross and be below the 80. The 30 and the 1 hr should be very near the cross but may not complete the cross for another candle or 2. Remember the 15 drives the 30 and the 30 drives the 1 hr, so if the 15 crosses and is below the 80, the 30 will follow and so will the 1 hr. The question is how long will they follow. Maybe 100 pips, maybe 300. That is where the 4hr pivots and day pivots come into play. Even more conservative is to go ahead and wait for the 30 cross. It may even still be above the 80. For me, when the 30m crosses below 50, the 1 hr should be nearing 50, that is usually when I am completing my third floor ride and getting out. I have taken the 1hr all the way to the 20 line, but it was about 3 hrs of trading and I didn't significantly increase my pip pull. The total move to that point was about 130 pips and I had netted 108. The last trade was what put me over 100 though and that was my very first time to do that. Quite a rush!!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
PipAV8tor, Very nice explanation of Spud's method. The rubber band can be a very good trade as long as one makes sure that it the 15min takes off by itself while the other three higher timeframes are in an overbought/oversold area or near it.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Moneda, Thanks for the tip on platforms and pip spreads. I'll check it out. In regards to the 14,3,3 and the 5,3,3- Charlies post with charts is right on. The 5 tells you what the 14 is gonna do in most cases. You also get some pretty good fakes from it, so refer to another time frame and see if your trade is bottoming or topping or you are just watching a retrace. I don't use the 5,3,3 on the 1hr or higher, because you are already "seeing" that info on the 5m/15m combo. I mostly use the 5,3,3 to time the retrace and my personal exits. Spuds plan was just to ride through those retraces and watch the 14,3,3 on the 4 hr go from 80 to 20 or 20 to 80, whichever. It just "hurts" me too much to see my pips go from 40 back to 20 and then back to 60. I'll keep my 40 and then add 25 or 30 more to it, God willing. LOL I also have not had the guts to ride the 4hr like that yet. I may build up to it, but I am comfortable exiting the first time the 1hr makes a full 80 to 20 or 20 to 80 swing. I will put some chart pics in here the next time I see a trade develop. I am only trading part time right now, but have had enough success recently that I am hoping to be full time trading and out of my other "job" by Dec. I am fairly new to Forex. I began "mentoring" under an experienced trader back in May of this year. I also use his theories and philosophy, but this thread is not about that. What I learned from Spuds writings is that you can use just the stochs, once you learn to read and interpret them. Other indicators, ma's are confirmations. Pivots give you a range to anticipate for a move. I hope this all makes sense. Easier to think it than to write it.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
It is much harder to put this into words, than I expected. Even more props to Spud. Wish he would come back. I try to keep a couple of things in focus; 1) be comfortable with the system you are using. Comfort=Confidence 2) Trade what you see!! NOT what you think will happen or what you want to happen. 3) you can't and shouldn't try to force a trade. You must wait until the signs are right. Go ahead and wait for 1 more 15m candle to close!! 4) WHEN IN DOUBT, REFER TO #2.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
what do you mean when you say ..."the smaller TF should be one step ahead (one candle) of the longer TF"? Could you please elaborate on that and possibly post a chart? Thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Step means one candle position or so, the best is when the stochs are right in step with one another. The most important thing to remember that I did not mention before is that be sure when you are looking at the crosses at 38.2 and 61.8 that both stochs are either moving up or down and you don't have a situation where 1 is stoch comming up and the other stoch is diving down and vice versa. You want both stochs to be moving in the same direction.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hello all, and welcome to our discussion. All I can say is "WOW!" Everyone has contributed such an enormous amount of valuable information, and I'm already feeling much more confident in my trading. Actually, Im feeling quite grateful. Charlies: I focused mostly on the rubber band trade today, per your explanation, and early this afternoon took two 30-pip trades -- one on EURUSD and the other GBPUSD. I really love the simplicity of the system. I'm using the 4H for direction, and then taking the 15M once it crosses back over os/ob. Rialto: I also somehow completely missed the Rope thread theory! Thanks for mentioning it, and thanks to endroute for posting the link! I'll check it out over the weekend. PipAV8tor: I'm with you. My best trades occurred when I was forced to leave the computer. If I sit and watch, I almost always kill what would have become really good trades. I've tried using the scalping technique, but I've found it nearly impossible to locate a setup where at least two stochs are above the 61.8 or below the 38.2 together. For scalping short TF pips, I prefer to follow Spud's "Quicker Pipping" instructions, and usually come out ahead when I find a good setup. No doubt, like many others, my biggest obstacle to success is my lack of patience. Either I get in too soon and the trade goes bad, or I make a good trade but exit before it's had a chance to blossom, as soon as I see price retracing. I've often thought I should just trade the downdraw, i.e., if I expect price to go long, I should go short, and earn some pips on the inevitable retrace!! I think the reason I'm feeling such clarity today is that many of the folks who have come down to join us have taken Spud's brilliant concepts and actually put them to work, each in his own way. Over time, they've discovered what works and what doesn't, and have gained a more experienced view of how to place these MTF Stochastics trades. And each and every one of you has been so incredibly generous in your willingness to share! Thanks again, everyone!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I just wanted to mention that, for those of you who keep stochs of four different time frames together in one window, please be aware that if you magnify your chart too much, you may lose the ability to clearly see the direction of each stoch line. In other words, you will always be able to see the endpoint of where the stoch is at the moment, but it's even more important to identify it's direction , and where it's coming from. Reducing the magnification -- making your candles smaller, viewing a longer stretch of time -- will give you a much better sense of what's going on. Just don't reduce it too much or you will end up with spaghetti...

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Would you please explain in detail the two trades you just spoke of using the rubber band technique (euro/Gbp)

--- 帖子 #66 ---
where are the indicators you have posted here on your charts? thnx

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi trader_X, I've attached a screen shot of the EURUSD trade (both trades were very similar). The vertical red line is approximately where I entered, based on the 15M stoch (the light blue line). I waited for price to cross the pivot, and placed my trade. Hope it's all clear.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hello k2kv, yes- I see and understand what youve done here. Nice trade and nice work. Thank you for taking the time to answer my post. But let me ask you another question- the 4hr(red line), do you wait until this line is flat or is it that you wait until it is above/below a certain line?(i.e. 70/30 or 80/20)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Trader_X, The 4H red line only appears flat in lower time frames (if you observe it in a 4H chart, it displays more of a wave). Anyhow, it's not the "flatness" that counts. According to Spud who originated this technique, the 4H should be in the oversold/overbought position (23.6/76.4) in order to validate this trade. In my illustrated trade, it was slightly below, not the optimum position according to strict rules. I felt it was close enough, but others may disagree. And remember, I am definitely no expert, having just been reintroduced to this "Rubber Band" method by Charlies. Good trading to you...

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello all, Glad someone has revived the spud theory/method. Spud's method really was one of the turning points in my newbie trading history. It allowed me to really see thru the swamp of indicators. Even though whoever coded the mtf stochasitcs indicator (and what a brilliant job it was) shows where the longer term stochastics is going to finish up in the particular timeframe (i think it was suggested to use it in the 15M tf), I have had a really hard time trading with it. I had taken several trades using the 15M stoch in line with the 1H stoch. Now the 1H stoch was showing it was going up (as an eg), but obviously as the hour was not up, it was just the extended line. But by the time the hour finished, the stoch was pointing down. I realise this is the characteristic of all mtf indicators, and am not faulting the indicator. Looking back at the chart, once the hourly stoch had completed, it would have been easy to say not to take the trade, but during live trading, it was a different case. Since trading is all about trading within your comfort zone, I have somewhat made an adaptation of the mtf stoch, and also gone with the rope theory. There are enough trades in the rope for gbp/jpy to yield more tahn 200 pips per mth. My adaptation was I took the mtf stochastics chart, and then in the window below, tried different stoch settings until it gave me the same shape/slope/curve of the 1H mtf and 4H mtf line. I have been looking at it, when I come back from work, and look at the potential trades, and compare them to the mtf stoch window, and they line up pretty well. The main thing that I have learnt, as has already been stated before - PATIENCE. Wait for the best trades, ie the one that fits your trade criteria perfectly, and you hardly have a trade go against you. There is atleast one trade in the day that will yeild 30-50 pips, with minimal drawdown. I look forward to continuing excellent contributions in this thread. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Kermut, Yes, I share your concern about entering a trade based on still developing candles. There are a couple of thing that I use with the pound/yen: Wait for the close of the targeted candle. Draw a trendline on the Stoch window to get a sense of direction of particular timeframe Try to go with the 4hr.trend because even if I prematurely enter and find myself dealing with a bigger drawdown, the volatility will turn things around....most of the time... unless there is a new trend in town! Keep an eye on pivots, support/resistance levels. If you are looking at a 15min candle that is nearing an important level and you still have 2 or three candles for the 1hr. to close, you may want to wait it out....but what if the 15min has no lower wick and it breaks through a significant level? Then, I may decide that the momentum is strong enough to push the 1hr. along. Trade the elasticity of the 15min. This approach works well as long as the higher time frames are in an overbought/undersold area or near it. With the pound/yen you see the 15min take off like a rocket and the higher time frames stay at the launchpad quite often. These observations have been made when my TP is 10-20 net pips. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Kermut, can you share in detail your adaptation to the mtf stoch? Thank you all for your contribution to this thread. Great thread! Thanks

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Good trade reguardless, but I thought that an elasticity trade only applied to the 15m and the other stoch were all either over bought or sold? One other question what is your typical TP, I try to focus on getting 10-20 pips and getting out, what is everyones take on this.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Spud came up with some great ideas and theories and then everyone has gone and taken those theories and made them their own, would it be helpful to everyone if I went through and put together a document that outlinned all of spuds approaches and then include some different variations so that we have it all in one place as opposed to numerous threads and forums. It may be useful to have a place for all the EAs and indicators too along with some notes on how to use them.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
endroute, I wouldn't get in a trade unless I was expecting a move of the 10-20 pip range. There are too many good opportunities throughout a 24 hr. period. That is where the pivot pts. on your 1hr or 4hr or day chart make a difference. They can give you an idea of how many pips to look for, based on s/r. The best scenario is to be watching your trade and then lock in the profit by moving your stop as the trade develops up or down. The risk in that is a quick retrace that takes out your stop before you are done riding. Then you have to decide whether or not to re-enter. The good part is you got stopped out with profit.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
k2kv, thanks for posting the chart and the explanation( and I apologize for taking so long to reply ) yes-that is why I asked about the 4 he line being flat. I thought that I remembered spuds theroy saying that the indicator needed to be above the 76/239 and I noticed that on your chart that it wasn't quite above it when you took the trade. So I wondered if there was something that I had missed. I understand now your reasoning and I like it- good call! Endroute, your suggestion to put together a summery of spuds material is an excellent idea. If there's anything I can do to help with that please let me know. I really think that such a document would be very helpful to anyone who is interested in his work

Each time i tried to anticipate what the indicator will do, i got slapped in the face by the market so i will plus this advice

Hi guys, I just took a nice rubber band trade this morning. Went to around +14, retraced all the way back to -2, then came back up to +14, and I exited when I was +13 pips. At this very moment price has moved down to 161.12, so I've left that on the table. Chart below, I entered at the red vertical line.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Moneda, Very good advice indeed, regarding the 4H trend and pivots, S &amp; R, etc. There's no point in stepping on your accelerator when you have a stop sign ten feet in front of you! For me, however, I pay very little attention to when a candle closes, since I've always felt that the actual close of a candle is somewhat arbitrary, and market price will move however it wants without any regard whatsoever to where a candle might be in it's cycle. I make my trades only when price and/or stochs reach or pass a certain level, whether a candle has closed or not. I do, of course, pay attention to candle formations, but that's another story altogether...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi Endroute, I thought it was. To quote Spud: "What we want is the 4H stochastic to be either oversold or overbought. Better if we have both the 1H or 4H stochastic in an overbought or oversold position but we must have the 4H stochastic in proper position." So, my impression is that we really only need the 4H and 15M in proper positions, and then we have a trade. This seems to happen frequently throughout the day and offers many opportunities for +pip trading. Regarding TP, I'm still getting out too early, but I'm happy if I can gain more than +10 every trade. If things begin to stall or retrace on me I am likely to pull the plug, as I have not learned much patience, and I scare easily. No doubt, time and experience will go a long way toward curing that. For example, my morning trade (post #78) had moved all the way down to 161.04 while I was posting this. I went short at 161.40, but got out at 161.27 with +13 pips, but left another 23 pips on the table (assuming I knew where the bottom would be). No regrets, though...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hello, This week I will focus on trading the AUD/JPY pair. Less costly to trade. Here is a Spud trade I made this morning for 42+ pips. I based my decision on three stochs coming out pretty much together of an oversold area and plenty of room between the two support levels. I try to focus my trades during high volatility periods and 3:00gmt, 10:00gmt and 16:00 gmt fit the bill.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Nice trade, Moneda! I've not yet traded that pair, trying to focus on these three: eurjpy, eurusd, gbpusd. Thanks for sharing with us...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
That pair was set to have a large move, based on announcements. Gold is down a bunch, like $14 an oz., and the Jen has been stronger today than for the last couple of weeks. Like a lot of other pairs today, it should have tested a low from as much as 2-4 months ago. If it did go a lot lower than where you got out, look for it to bounce back as the week progresses. The GBP/JPY tested lows from back in July and is looking to move even a little lower, before a recovery looks likely. Of course, all that is theory, not written in stone. As always, trade what you see. Looked at chart: Moved over 200 pips south and has now rebounded about 150, back to nearly where it started this morning. Talk about your escalator ride down and rubberband it back up.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
anyone see the 15m /30m on the G/Y right now? It looks to me like we could see a long coming. The 5,3,3 is entering what looks like the begining of an upward move of the 50,10,20 and the 20,10,20. i know its not the ideal time to trade but i unfortunately have a day job. could anyone give me there opinion on this set up..?? It sorta looks like the 15m will turn upwards soon and then move the 30m the same way.. but id really like someone elses veiw on this

--- 帖子 #85 ---
TraderX, I think is a bit premature....ranging for several hours......30 and 60 in the overbought area...Let the stoch show the way. I would wait for the 15 to come back and join the other two if that turns out to be the direction(long).

--- 帖子 #86 ---
yes i too think it is premature ...but worth watching ... thank you for you for the reply.when you say wait for the 15m to come back and join the 30 and 60 do you mean let the wave (50,10,20 and 20,10,20) finish rising , then fall, then possibly catch it when it joins the 30 and 60? k2kv...what do you think about that???

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Trader X, What I see is that the 4hr. crossed the 23.6 level, the 15min is pointing up so IMHO I would wait for the 15min to join the 30/60 and watch the momentum of price action....maybe look at a lower tf like the 5min....are the candles bullish and showing no tails? I am not sure what you mean by the wave, can you explain it to me? Thanks

--- 帖子 #88 ---
sorry about that.. the wave is a slang term i use to describe the stoch. 50,10,20 and the stoch. 20,10,20...spud used to talk about waiting for these stochs. to to all be going the same direction in a nice smooth parallel fashion...( they sort of form a wave ) then wait for the 5,3,3, stoch to cross through it and turn to join with it ...thats where you would look to get in.there were other things to consider as well but thats what i mean by the wave

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Trader_X. Thanks for the explanation. A long is looking better. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi all, After most pairs experienced long runs up last night, the 4H stoch is, on most charts, neither oversold nor overbought. Frankly, with the 4H mostly in the middle of our charts (50's - 60's), I have no idea what kind of stoch trades I should be looking for, since I've been relying on the 4H extremes for guidance. Anyone care to chime in with some trading ideas for the day? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi all, I decided to take this trade, just exited a few minutes ago with +12 pips. I entered when both 15M &amp; 30M had clearly crossed down over 76.4. I watched after the 15M (aqua) had crossed, and once the 30M (blue) followed, price moved fairly quickly. Only spent fifteen minutes in the trade. Entered at 163.44, out at 163.32; price still moving lower (as usual) as I write this. Someday I hope to overcome my fear of loss when I'm ahead!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Don't ever feel bad about taking profit. +12 is a nice trade. The thing to do is not give it back!! I would look at some larger time frames, like the day chart and see where your s/r are there via pivot points. There may be a chance to re-enter and continue the short or it is going to find support and bounce back up. No more announcements set for today, until much later, so what I have noticed is that makes the s/r lines come more into play and psychological levels with .50's and .00's Looking at a possible short on the GBP/USD. Stochs are over 50 on the 4hr and just below 80 on the day chart, so slightly oversold, and the day chart candle is up against R1. This is the 4th rejection of that point and would indicate a strong move back toward 2.0390/50 level. Unless it breaks through and then it would push toward 2.0650 which is R2. Just watching now. 2nd update: Looking more like it wants to continue up and test 2.0550 and maybe more. Still watching. A rejection at this 2.0500 area would probably send it back toward 2.0450 or lower and make the short look good. Patience.

Hi PipAV8tor, Thanks for the good advice. Actually, I do watch the pivot and S &amp; R -- have them automatically display in my charts and also subscribe to a service -- and I'm always aware of them. In this case I was wide open going short, nothing in the way for miles, except perhaps the 76.4 fib, so I felt comfortable entering the trade. But the funny thing is, I didn't really think about how open it was when I began to worry about keeping my small gain. No doubt, I should have taken the open space as a signal to remain in. And, don't you know it, it stopped dead in its tracks at exactly the 76.4 fib, a good 50 pips away from my entry! Thanks for jogging my head! Do you normally trade after noon EST? I find prices kind of "drift" around once the London sesion closes.

I am at my "real" job right now, so I watch in the background. I am on CST. I miss alot of prime time because of this place, but I can login to my home pc from here. I don't usually trade much in this time because there isn't much activity, but I have noticed the GBP likes to drift south against the USD and JPY until about 4 EST. Not always. Just happened to be looking today. I do a lot of evening trading, that is why I like the GBP/JPY. I also watch the AUS and NZD at night. In the next 30-60 days, I hope to be out of here and just trading. We'll see how that goes.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
update 3: looking more and more like it just wants to consolidate right where it is for now. Not enough activity this time of day, but sometimes there is enough to cause a move/re-trace. Just wishful thinking today and fortunately "patience" kept me on the sideline. :

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi PipAV8tor, Patience is indeed a virtue... Your thinking was right on spot, but the market must have had its own ideas. Glad you waited, nice work! I'm in NY, EST. Once I get my son off to school, my trading time is limited to 9-12 AM unless I want to get up at 3 AM for the London open. You mentioned that you trade in the evening. I wonder what times you find most productive. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
K2KV, Totally depends on announcements. Tonight with the JPY @ 7:50 EST could cause a little action. The AUS and NZD usually announce at 9:30 EST and they can cause some movement. The AUS may move a lot depending on the price and activity related to Gold throughout the day, as well. Without an announcement of some type, it is at least 10 or 11 my time before anything gets going. I can sometimes catch some early morning action, like maybe 6 or 7, but the kids are getting ready for school, so it is hard to focus and then I am off to the cell errr... work.

Hi guys, I took a potentially good trade this afternoon, but really messed it up and thought I'd share, whith the hope that others might learn something in the process. I was trading based on both the 15M &amp; 30M crossing up over 23.6. The 15M had crossed, and the 30M was just about to cross when I took a brief phone call. Once I hung up I turned to my charts again, the price and 30M stoch had jumped up more than I was expecting, but I took the trade anyway at 163.35 ("A" on chart below), with a 20 pip SL. Sure enough, price immediately retraced around -10 and flopped around a bit, heading down to -15 or so, and I began to get itchy. So, I waited, and it came back to around -7, then back down to -16, and seemed bent on going even lower. Eventually it came back to -11 but I had to leave the house for awhile, so I decided to get out at -11 ("C" candle on chart) and minimize my loss. Stupid, stupid, stupid... A couple of hours later I revisited my charts and -- sure enough -- I had been right all along! Price had moved all the way up to 163.64 with hardly another retrace along the way! Had I remained in the trade, I would have seen a profit of +29, instead of my -11. And, if I had entered at the right time as planned ("B" on chart), I would have been in at around 163.00, which would have added another +35 pips to my trade, for a total of more than +60 on a slow afternoon trade! I write this as a lesson for myself, and possibly for others who might be as new to the game as I am. So, I guess the lesson is: 1. If you miss your opportunity, don't chase the trade. 2. Once you make your decision to take a trade, stay with it! Every time I get out early due to drawdown, I am guaranteed a loss and, almost without exception, my initial decision turns out to have been right all along! Can't seem to shake this bad habit. Any advice for this novice? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
K2KV, I feel your pain. I'm sure others do also. There are really only the 2 choices. You made a sound choice, because you had to leave, just take your lumps and live to trade another day. The other choice is to set a stop you can stomach, maybe at the Fib line just below your A candle, and set a reasonable profit limit of plus 10 or 15 pips and let it play out. In this case, it would have worked out, but you could have also had a greater loss. Its a coin flip. The good news is, you will have many opprotunities to make up for one bad moment. Lots of JPY announcements tonight, if I recall. Should make for some good movement.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Jeff, Thanks for sharing a negative result. The circumstances made it difficult for you because you could not monitor your trade as you usually do but you did exercise restrain/discipline by closing your trade for a small loss. If there is anything that I can add is that the eur/jpy and aud/jpy need breathing room so in my case as long as I am going with the trend, I will give it as much as 50 pips. In most cases it has turned a negative entry into a profitable one after a price rebound. In order not to panic is important to stick to an amount that you does not cloud your decision with fear and/or greed. There is plenty of info on money management out there but I am sure that you have read that stuff already. Jacko's strategy is to get out and then hop back in at the exit price after the rebound. You are not alone....I've had my share of dumb mistakes.... Here is one for you....I once lost over 200 pips after placing a trade at my in-laws on my way to the airport only to find myself stuck in the airport, unable to access my account and guess what? I have forgotten to put a stoploss!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Pip, I thought about the fib (and the pivot, as well) to protect my SL, but I rarely risk more than 20 pips, ever since I had my two big losses of - 50 each when I first began. The simple truth is, I think, I got in too late, and should have waited for another opportunity. If I had gotten in when I wanted to, my SL would have been placed below those levels and all would have been okay. I'll look for they JPY announcements. Funny, I am so accustomed to watching for US news, I tend to forget about the rest. Thanks for your thoughtful reply!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Moneda, Wow - 50 pip SL is so scary to me, especially since I am still so new at this game and am not completely confident in my ability to make good trade decisions. As I mentioned in my previous post, when I first started out I made two bad trades with 50 pip SL each, and lost a quick $1k USD. Scared the heck out of me, and I've been a little gun-shy ever since! I have indeed read much of what's been written about money management, but will have to check out Jacko, since I've heard of that strategy before, as well. I appreciate you sharing your 200 pip mistake; it helps to know I'm not alone. Many thanks for your good advice...

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Jeff, What u have described is very common amoung us traders that do not have the ability to set aside time purely for trading. The only way I can thing that you should have handled this, is that once the price was on its way, and you still believe in the trade,but are late to enter, determine where you would have entered, and what ur sl price would have been. Enter the trade with the same sl price, but adjust (reduce) ur trade size to reflect the higher pip sl. This way,u r still risking the same $$, but more pips, and in a trade that according to ur system, is a valid trade. Also, if two 50 pip sl have made u a very cautious trader, then I am suspecting, you are trading too high a leverage. That is my 2 pips worth. Regards, K PS. someone posted earlier for me to share my stoch settings that I adapted, Sorry I haven't had a chance, shall do it today or in the next few days.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Kermut, That is just very, very good advice, and I will apply it the next time I enter a trade later than I'd like. I work from home, so I can trade as long as I like, but I am unfortunately on the east coast, so the market gets pretty sluggish in the afternoon. You've hit the nail on the head, though, in that we often feel we need to make some trades, so our limited trading hours might force us into some less-than-perfect setups. Regarding my high leverage, you're absolutely correct there, too. I entered the fray trading with larger dollars than I should have, but have since cut way back on my lot size, and will remain here until I begin to have a preponderance of pip-positive trades. For now, it's not so much the money as it is my desire to remain in positive territory (not that the money is not important, of course). Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Jeff, At one point, I had a tendency to cut losses when a trade went a few pips against me. This is the way I now think about it to avoid that temptation: Say your original trade you were aiming for a positive RR of say 2, risk 20 target 40 When you were considering whether to get out your options were: A. get out for -11 B. stay in for risk of 9 &amp; potential gain of 51 so RR better that 5, and no spread to pay If something has changed, then it can be better to get out and cut your losses BUT, if nothing has changed, staying in offers a fantastic low risk trade opportunity. Charlie

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Charlie, Interesting perspective, makes a lot of sense. The temptation to exit a trade when it seems to be turning against you is rather strong, and it seems almost unnatural to remain in the boat while it's sinking. I'll have to work on this. Hey -- you guys are great, and I really appreciate all the time you've spent helping less experienced traders like me achieve greater success! Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hello, I have a suggestion....why don't we place one of our charts or just describe what we are monitoring before we enter a trade? Perhaps it will generate discussion/advise/opinions that would be beneficial to all. Here is what I am looking at today. I am basically waiting for a change of trend or a significant retracement to enter. My main focus is the MTF Stochs, if the 15/30 break the 76.4 with an nice angle. I would also like to see the 60 on its way down. I also keep an eye on the BB 's direction...is it hooking down? are the bands narrowing?. S/R....is price bouncing off a previous resistance now acting as support? Anyway....this is all theory right now...we will see what I end up doing when the is decision time. ........Patience....Patience......P.... PS: In and out for +18....My goal is at least 20 pips/day so this can be a good start...I may go in again if the retracement and/or breakout continues....Although soon I have to go to work

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Good morning Moneda, Great idea! Only problem I see is that we'd all have to be trading around the same time of day. I trade from 9AM EST; wonder when everyone else is available to participate. I'd love to see a more interactive environment where we can all see what the others are thinking. Nice trade, by the way -- but, I don't know what pair you're trading! So, I must ask -- why trade the retracement against the trend, rather than look for a move with the trend? Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Jeff

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi guys, Right now I'm watching the EURUSD, as 4H is well up at the top, and all the others are down at the bottom. Lower TF stochs are beginning to turn up, and I will watch for the 15 to cross 23.6 on its way back up, followed by the 30M. A pretty clear shot up before I hit any S &amp; R or fibs.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Well, I'll take that back... Looks like I don't have such a clear shot after all (was looking at wrong data sheet): SI, S2, R1, R2 &amp; pivot, all impeding the way for an up move. I'll have to wait...

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hello, I see your intentions... The stoch may come back to the 4hr trend if there is adequate momentum to breakthrough your s/r/p. My pair is showing on the chart is aud/jpy. I went short again but right now I am down 15 pips not counting the +18 so .... I will either set a s/l and a pt or hang around until I close the trade. Good luck

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Moneda, Aud/jpy is a 4-pip spread on Oanda , where gbpusd is 2.5, and eurusd is only .9 (!) so my inclination is to spend less on every trade, if possible. I'm currently watching gbpusd as the 15M has fallen all the way down below 23.6 and once it turns around with confidence I'll look to go long as the stoch crosses back over. Much cleaner field back up, with all significant levels well below the current price. Good luck on your trade; please keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Jeff, Sounds like a plan....aud/jpy is coming down again. Usually I trade the pound/yen but lately I have been trading the aussie because of lower spreads /commission and it is a tamer so I don't have to sweat the big fluctuations of the pound/yen. Good luck

--- 帖子 #114 ---
A quick look at my audjpy chart does seem to show a more mild pair, nice steadier moves than what I'm trading here. Looks like it's going your way, after all. Nice! EURUSD keeps testing its levels and falling back. Even though the stochs are looking good (and I suspect momentum will overcome the levels standing in its way), I think there's a good chance I'll get killed if I enter this cycle. We shall see...

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Took the GBPUSD at 2.0592, now up +3 as I write. TP &amp; SL both set to 23. We'll see how I feel as it progresses.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Well, I just took my GBPUSD profit at +10 pips. Decided that this week I would pretty much just let my trades run, once I was in (trying to exercise discipline here). Watched price move up nicely to +20, then retrace and drift awhile. I decided to get out when tweezer top candles formed on my 15M chart, a sure sign of price reversal. Happened at the same time as the 15M stoch hit the 76.4. Seemed right. Fear of loss was not a factor here (I had already moved my SL to BE). I simply exited based on my chart reading. And , at the moment, it appears to have been the right move, but this could change quickly. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #117 ---
And so it did! Price moved right back up, would have put me in even greater profit, and my +23TP would have been fait accomplis. Ahh, if only I had ignored my charts as I promised I would! Very tricky game, for sure...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Jeff, Very nice. I am basically targeting the same # of pips as you. Well, I came home from work and a half an hour later I exited with an extra 9+ pips. It is 2:30pm est and the action slows down quite a bit so I will wait for and see how the action is when Tokyo Opens.... Darn! price dropped another 10pips ..Oh well have to remind myself that there will be another opportunity around the corner. Until next time

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Do you have a template for your chart set-up? Thanks

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Guys, you are doing great with this. Have you tried a scaled exit, ie ext x% of position when you normally would, and leave a little on for those times when it really flies in your direction? eg. if you sl is say 20 pips, and u exit 80% of ur position at say 10 pips, bring ur remainder position to be or 5 pip sl etc. Many posibilities, but it gives you the ability to really capitalise on a really good move. Another thing to note is the rope theory by spud. I have often found that if you look at the 1hr rope or the 4h rope, and if your trades are in the direction being pointed by the rope, you are cutting yourself short by exiting early. This is where scaled exit is really beneficial. Have a look at it, and let me know what you think. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Good Morning, Thank you, Kermut. I will consider your strategy for harvesting pips...it is a sound approach. The fear/greed tug of war that takes place in the heat of battle is an ever present challenge! Generally speaking, I have tried to follow Spud's method of waiting for the 15 or 30 to penetrate the over bought/sold area as my TP or use a trail stop. At the present time, I am trying to stick to my 10-20+ pips as my TP, taking into consideration the volatility of the pair... A hit and run approach that helps my consistency/discipline. Well, today I woke up to see a strong surge by the crosses. I am watching the retracement of the aud/jpy. Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Kermut, Thanks for your suggestion. I'm aware of this kind of partial TP strategy but, like Moneda, I am trying to get my ducks in a row first, make a firm profit and exit, since my success rate is not yet where I want it to be. Once I'm able to make simple positive trades with greater consistency, I will definitely bergin to apply more sophisticated TP strategies such as the one you've described. As an aside, I also subscribe to a service where trade calls are made every evening. And, along with the calls, there is a similar TP strategy, i.e., "first target, etc." and I'm gaining additional perspective from that membership. If you're interested, you can PM me but I have no relationship or interest other than having been introduced to the service by another forex trader with much more experience than myself. Thanks again, Jeff

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi Bill, I've attached the template, plus a few indicators used by the template. This will give you a main window with automatic fibonacci levels, S&amp;R and pivot levels, and a lower window with 4-different stochs. The multi-stochs run best in a 15M chcart. Simply copy the .mq4 files to MT4_yourbrokerplatform/experts/indicators, and copy the .tpl (template) file to MT4_yourbrokerplatform/templates (NOT experts/templates). Close and restart MT4 and apply the template to your chart. Good luck!

Hello, Well, my first entry was a short with the aud/jpy (red vertical line on the chart) ...it turned out to be a dud. I made "0" pips....guess is better than negative although I did pay $.92 commission for the trade. I entered while the 15 / 30 were below the 76.4 but it reversed and went back into the overbought area. I was down at least 30 pips but my familiarity with the situation kept me in until I had to go to work and decide to exit for no profit. My second was a long (green vertical line) for 9.9 pips+. I came home and there it was the 15 / 30 close together heading towards the 76.4. The previous candle was very bullish so I entered and exited when the 15 penetrated the overbought area. I also keep my eyes on a 1min chart with a 1/5/15 mtf stoch for fine tuning. Okay, later tonite BOJ will release their interest rate statement. Maybe there will be some action. Now is time to relax, read, play some online chess and sit on my hands! Until later,

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Moneda, Nice work! And thanks for sharing your trades today. Glad you ended up with +pips!! I'm not trading at all today -- I'm going in for surgery tomorrow and the phone has been ringing all morning, so I just gave up. I'll be recuperating through the weekend, and plan to begin trading again on Monday! But, I don't exactly understand what caused you to enter on the first trade. Looks like your 30 had not crossed down until four or five candles after your first entry (as indicated in chart below). Am I misreading your chart? Would you mind clarifying this for me? Thanks much...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Jeff, First let me wish you a quick and healthy recovery. But, I don't exactly understand what caused you to enter on the first trade. Looks like your 30 had not crossed down until four or five candles after your first entry (as indicated in chart below). Am I misreading your chart? Would you mind clarifying this for me? Oh yes! the incomplete candle can do that to you! I did not wait for a candle close and at the time that I enter both had crossed the 76.4 only to jump back into the overbought area. I have to be careful with my tendency to not want to miss one minute of the party! I have been rethinking this and it might make more sense, since I am only targeting 10-20+ pips, to wait for a stronger confirmation....maybe even wait for the 60 before entering. Sometimes a party does not get going until much later in the nite. I sound like a party animal but I am really not . I just like that analogy! Thanks for asking

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Moneda, Thanks for your kind thoughts. Fortunately my necessary surgery is not life-threatening, just life-interrupting! Although I'll be given general anesthesia, I should be home later in the day! What will kill you, though, is entering too early! Spud said this, and I've experienced it myself. I feel much safer entering when the 15 has already made its way to 38.2, and the 30M has crossed 23.6. Doesn't always happen like that, but I'm almost always guaranteed profit when my entry is more solid. And, like you, I'm happy with +10-20 pips or so per trade. Thanks again, Jeff

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi all, It has occurred to me that explaining and describing how we define our stochastics trades might be more easily accomplished if we were to streamline our terms. That is, we could convert our stochastic percentages into levels. So, instead of having to remember (and write) for example, 23.6, or 38.2, we could simply say, "level 1" or "L2." And, for 76.4, we would instead write, "level 5." So, we'd only have five levels, from bottom to top: L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5. Seems like a simple transition to me, especially since we're only using the five specific numbers anyway, and the numbers themselves hold little meaning. Frankly, it just might be easier, and a bit more visual to follow, as most of our trades depend upon us reaching or crossing a certain "level." I'm not committed to this idea, just throwing it out there for comments. And, if it doesn't make sense to anyone, well, please consider it just another silly thought and forget I even brought it up. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon11.gif Any opinions on this?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Now watching EURJPY. 4H shows strong long-term uptrend. 15M is OS and beginning to turn up. If it climbs up to break L1 (23.6) with a good angle up, I'll probably take the long trade. However, if it softens too much before rising, I might pass. Even though it is "off-hours," I've often seen this pair trade nicely all day long, so I'll keep watching.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hello folks, New trader here, trying lots of things. I'm having some success with MTF stochs and am enjoying the various related threads. I'm watching GJ - see the charts below. The H4 looks like it ready to turn down on the threads. Maybe later tonight or tomorrow. Would you wait for the threads to break 76.4 before taking any short? And in the meantime there might be a long trade on the M15 if the H1 stoch slids a bit more and then turns back up? Thanks CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Did you take the trade and where did you get in? Thanks, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #133 ---
So, I did take that trade, soon after the 15M crossed up over the 23.6. I could not stay at the monitor, but kept popping back into my office to follow progress. Was a slow move, but after retracing around -8 pips the price did come back up. On my last check to see how things were going, the 15M had just crossed the 76.4 and I was up +7 pips so I exited. In at 165.56 (+3 spread), out at 165.66. Not a big trade, but a good one. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Chart below...

Jeff, Nice trade. Little pips become big pips! I am stuck in a short with the aud/jpy but no panic yet....there is still some breathing room but it is getting stuffy...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks Moneda, Funny cartoon. Good luck with your short! Take care...

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi CanuckCT, Welcome aboard! By threads, I assume you mean the rope. Unfortunately, I don't believe most of us trade the rope, though at least a couple of us do. Perhaps they can answer your questions more specifically. So, I'll just offer some general info regarding your questions: We don't generally trade the 4H stoch. It simply guides us as to the longer term trend. Once we have established the direction of the trend, we then look at the lower TF stochs for possible trade opportunities. You are planning to go short. But, based on your charts, it looks like your pair is in a LONG trend. Personally, I rarely trade against the trend, since price will surely head in the direction of the trend before too long, no matter how or where I place my trade. Much safer than swimming against the waves. Hope that helps some...

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Thanks for the feedback, So this would be a typical setup - see attached chart. I sold at the red line and collected 14 pips. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hello fellow traders! This is my 1st post here, and I hope I will be able to give some little contribution and feedback to Jeff thread here. You will only need to bear with my poor english, please! I have been interested in stochastics long before stumblin' in Spudfyre's great original thread on MTF Stochastic method. I do believe this indicator is by far the most useful among the many and indeed can be quite rewarding if we get to fully know his behavior and applications. Even Marcel Link, in his book "High Probability Trading" mentions it as his most favourite indicator. Spudfyre has given us a terrific way of using stochastics, and I believe it is helping many of us to make more profitable trades...at least this is what we are trying to do right now. I have made a lot of backtesting, quite a few sleepless late evenings, and then came up with my very personal method of trading..still to be fully defined, but nevertheless very close to the way Spudfyre presented it. But I still have a long way to learn, and I hope to share some intuitions and thoughts with all of you here. Well, as it's my first post, and I dont want to seem to be too talkative or intrusive. I will certainly post more soon. For now I just attach the last trade I made just a few hours ago: http://h1.ripway.com/Gua/Immagine.JPG EUR/JPY is my favourite currency pair. I do most of my trades on this pair. This morning (I'm in Europe) there was a very good setup with M15, M30 and H1 all heading up with the H4 standing quietly in the OB level, (looking like it was waiting for the other timeframes to join it) M15 had just left the OS level. In about 3 hrs, I managed to get +40 pips. I had to leave home, so I closed the trade. And, as at noon GMT none of the timeframes has gone lower the 80 line yet. So there was still room for more pips. Setups like that (aiming for 40+ pips) can be seen almost every day, and that is what I personally try to look for in my trades. Well, that's all for now, and see you back soon! Sedge PS Hope your little surgery went just OK, Jeff!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
CanuckCT, Taking profit is always the right thing to do, with no regrets. I am just curious why you got out when you did. That was nearly a text book set up to use a trailing stop loss and just keep locking in profit. Easily 20-30 more pips and you were totally safe because you just keep moving your stop south with the price. Sometimes it is hard to stay in for the ride and I leave pips on the table to, but I don't even think about getting out until things cross the 50 line in either direction and things seem to be losing "steam". Just my 2 U.S. cents worth.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hello PipAV8tor, The only reason I exited was that i had to leave for work or I would have followed it down. I do have to work on my exits though. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hello all, I'm attaching another good setup. Here the long term trend is up as per the H4 stochastic. And all 3 LTF stoastics are headed back up together. So am I understanding that all 3 LTF stochs must be aligned to have a high probability of success? It certainly seems that way. Here the LTF stochs never really went oversold but headed back up together. So how far down should they go before you would consider it a valid setup. I didn't get in this trade as I was in a meeeting, but would have taken it. Made a 50 pip move before it really showed any sign of slowing. Also, are there any other high probability patterns that should be traded. Thanks, CanuckCT

Hello again, Attached is a setup I did take using MTF stoch threads on a 15M timeframe. Any comments? Closed 50 PIPS - and it's still moving down. Gotta work on my exits. Can someone suggest a good trade manager EA. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Would anyone have taken this trade on USDCAD? Would be long at .9440 to .9445 and could have locked say 15-20 pips. I believe trading a rope like this is a high probability trading pattern on stochastic threads. Cheers, CanuckCT

Jeff and other Spudytes, In my last post: I am stuck in a short with the aud/jpy but no panic yet....there is still some breathing room but it is getting stuffy... Well, I am not sure if this fits within the scope of this thread but since it is related to a MTF trade I thought I share it with you. I think it is important to share the "good, the bad and the ugly" thus this post. I went short Tuesday on the aud/jpy when the 15/30/260 were below the 76.4 and the 60min was still in the overbought area. My thinking (maybe my first mistake ! was that the 60 would follow and everything would go as planned. The trade did go my way for about 8 pips but I wanted more ( ). Price action did not listen to my plan and began its bullish move while I waited for a pullback. The drawdown continued....10,30,40,50...Finally the pullback showed up after the Fed rate statement but I hesitated thinking( ) that the trend down would continue only to see it shoot up like a rocket before I pulled the trigger...Oh I forgot to mention that I had added to my initial entry why? well ... I wanted to recoup my drawdown with the pullback! Okay, now I am not longer thinking, I am in a situation that hopefully I will not let myself be in again. My thinking turned into hoping and praying that this bull stops at the its highest price going back to July. Well, it did and this morning I exited with a 23 pip loss....better than 150+ . Now, I will lick my wounds and get ready to trade when the 15/30/60 to cross the 76.4 before I even consider my next move. I apologize if this long post was out of context but I shared it with other Spudytes in mind. Good luck

Hi Moneda, I'm on meds and recuperating today from my surgery yesterday, but wanted to stop at the computer to catch my email and read some threads. Thanks everyone for your well wishes. A few months ago I had discovered a small mass in my neck/throat area and finally had it removed yesterday. Turned out to be a large thyroglossal duct cycst (something some of us are apparently born with!). Anyhow, it's benign, no other issues, and I'm just sore from the surgery, will be fine in a few days. So, let's move on... First of all, your post is NOT off topic at all. I think it's just as important to discuss our errors as our good trades, as we can all learn much from both sides of the coin. I appreciate your sharing, and would love to see more errors posted. Your loss could have been much worse, of course. But, I must ask: why do you prefer to trade AGAINST the longterm trend? Surely, you know that the probability of price going long in an uptrend is much greater than expecting price to continue short. Even on a sharp breakout to the other side, price is almost guaranteed to eventually turn back up. Price moves both ways, for sure, but for the safest trades, I prefer to go where probability is my favor (though I can't honestly say I have never done the opposite!). I realize many folks like to trade the retracements, but it's not the safest game in town. You're much better off (IMHO) waiting for the retracement to end, then entering again upon resumption of the longterm trend. I don't think I'll be taking any trades until Monday, geting itchy already. Take care...

I'm posting 2 charts that I believe illustrate how MTF stochastics are meant to be traded...I did not trade it this way and exited too early (but with 50 pips) . It's part of my education before I risk real money. Moving to M30 as M15 get oversold, then to H1 ad M30 gets oversold and maybe to H4...as the H1 not quite oversold yet. My original entry was at 240.75...now trading at 238.26, that's a 250 pip move. Trading the threads and moving up a time frame would have kept me in this trade. I can only post 2 charts, but now the H4 looks like it's heading down. Comments anyone? CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Again, moving to higher TF would have kept you in this trade. Look at M30

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Canuck, No, it is not necessary to have all three stochs heading up together. The trade you took is an "elasticity" trade, also called a "rubber band." According to Spud's rules, you can simply trade the 15M back up to the 4H, without much regard to the other stochs. Of course, it's always nicer to have a confluence of stochs in your favor, but for this type of trade it is not really necessary. 4H must be OB, 15M must cross up from below. It's that simple. And, it does appear that your 15M stoch first crossed below, before crossing back up, so it was indeed valid. Personally, I like it better when the 15M comes all the way down from the top before descending to the bottom, but each chart requires a different interpretation. Experience reading the charts and watching our stochastics will no doubt teach us all to be better traders. Charlies has posted a number of similar "rubber band" trades with an excellent explanation (see his earlier post #12). Though he uses different time frames, the concept remains the same. I have also posted a number of these trades, as they have become my favorite, too, and my most reliable thus far. You may not receive much feedback regarding your rope trades, as I sense most of the folks here (myself included) don't use them. Good trading!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Jeff, Glad to hear that you are recovering and willing to make the time to answer my post. You are absolutely correct....and eventhough I managed to erase my negative pips with a few scalps, I am not happy with "itchyness". Spud's method gave us an opportunity to make 20+ pips if we study and followed his recommendations. One of my challenges is to stay out and wait for the ideal situation and not try to jump in early. Thanks for the advise and use this time off to study the movement of the MTF Stoch.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Canuck, If you're looking for EA's you should probably visit the original thread by Spudfyre which has since become a playground for EA developers. Ask your question there and you will most likely be pleasantly rewarded (I'm trying to keep this thread a relatively EA FREE zone). http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Also, there are many other threads devoted to EA's here on FF, that might serve you as well, or better. Take care, Jeff

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hello Canuck, Thank you for your postings, I agree with Jeff's comments. The elasticity trade is probably the simplest and safest strategy by Spud. Please, continue your posts with the rope approach. I personally do not use it but I appreciate your comments and someday I will add it to my arsenal. Emda, one of Spud's follower, uses the rope extensively; you may want to pm him. Good luck

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Dear Moneda, Yes, it appears we both suffer from the same "itchy" malady. I'm doing all I can to keep away today -- can't you tell? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif The good news is, I suspect we are not alone...

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Jeff, ...... Change the names on the picture below and you got us!

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Ah yes, Moneda, They sure look like us! Thanks for the laugh today -- I really needed that!!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Jeff, Glad you are doing better. Keep the fingers working and rest the throat, right? I have to try and figure out how to post some of my charts in here. I usually just do screen shots and post them in Word docs, so I have to figure out how to just grab the chart. Moneda, I don't know if this advice helps, but think of pips in small terms. When I enter a trade, my expectation is only for 3-5 pip profit. Sounds really small but easy to do 3 or 4 times a day and that is generally 10-20 pips a day. If I get more, I am happy, but 3-5 is a "perfect" trade for me. Remember Spuds trades, a lot of them were small also. He would get 20 for the day in 2-3 trades and then work on his pip bank if things looked good. I give you this example of how effective that can be. Start with 20K in an account. Each trade, for risk management, your lot is .0025 of your account. That is 1/4 of 1%. In this case, that works out to be about 50 bucks or 5 lots. Take 10 pips for 20 trading days. Your lot size will increase as your acct. grows, but at the end of the 20 days, your acct. will be well over 200K. I can send you a spread sheet if you want to see the math. In regards to your trade where you got stuck, set a stop limit and use that limit. If it stops out, your account is safe. Especially in the time frame you were trading. With all the BIG announcements on Wed, it was VERY risky, IMHO to stay in that trade. Could have wiped you out. Thankfully, it retraced for you. I don't trade for 30 minutes before a big announcement and wait at least 30 minutes after a big announcement. I may miss some quick pips, but at 10-20 a day, I can make a butt load of money. Just some food for thought.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi PipAV8tor, So, did you buy your airplane with pips? Thanks for your kind thoughts. You can just save your screen grabs to your desktop. I place mine in a folder on my desktop called XFER (stands for "transfer"). Once I am posting to a thread I simply click on the attachment icon (paper clip), browse for that folder, open it up, select the file, and press uploiad in the FF attachment window. It's easy once you do it a couple of times. Your small pips suggestion is good advice. And, you're right about Spud's daily goal of 20. Felicia (of the Cornflower system) recommends a goal of only 10 pips per day! It's much easier to keep a steady flow of small pips coming in than it is to shoot for bigger numbers. I know guys who play for much bigger numbers, though, and it often makes me want to shoot higher (greed, greed, greed). But, they also suffer some very big losses, so I guess it's all relative. YESSSS -- I would love to see that spreadsheet. Would be more than nice to see $200k in my account after only twenty days of trading for small pips! Thanks again...

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Email me and I'll send it to you, can't do an attachment in here. I actually fly airplanes and helicopters. Don't own one yet, but might in the future. I'm happy to share.

Please be aware of the Non-farm payroll report 8:30 EST tomorrow (Friday) morning. You would want to be flat (no open trades) a good half-hour or more before and after. Unless, of course, you simply enjoy the rush...

--- 帖子 #159 ---
PipAVi8tor, Thank you so much for your advise. Don't you ever shy away from giving me your perspective. Sometimes we need to hear it from others especially from more experienced traders. Jeff....no singing for a while OK? Here is a possible rubberband trade in the making:

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello, A possible rubberband trade. The 60 and the 240 are in an oversold area. The 30 is flatenning out and the 15 is crossing the 76.4 with a sharp angle. I might wait for the 30 candle to be completed and see if it starts to point down. Volatility is low around this time so I may skip it and go to bed. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I would definitely time your entry, if you get in, with the 5 min chart. you don't have a lot of room to maneuver, so you need to be more precise and make sure the 5/15 and 30 are all bouncing toward the larger time frame.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi Moneda, The 15 has turned up on my screen. I would wait awhile. I don't know how this pair usually runs, but there might be too little volume at this time of day to stabilize your short trade. Just a thought. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Moneda, Also, another reason I'm not in love with this one is because, although the 4H is down at the bottom, the true longterm trend is up, not down. So, I can't decide for myself which direction you should be trading in. Big help, huh? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon3.gif

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Aren't you supposed to be resting!!!!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Yikes -- Caught again!! I must be restless after sleeping half the day. But I'm heading off to bed for the night, right now -- promise!! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hello Guys, Thanks for the feedback. I agree with your evaluation, that is why I went to bed and got some needed rest. There were a couple of opportunities as I slept but more will come. This morning we can see on the charts below that the aud/jpy broke a major trendline yesterday and presently is heading up....at least for now. On the 15min chart the MTF Stochs are gathering in the overbought area and the 4hr is above the 23.6. We will see what happens after the Non Farm announcement. I don't expect to make a trade until the dust settles unless I find a scalping opportunity with the 1/5/15 MTF Stoch chart. Happy pipping today and have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hello, Went long....(12:51pm est)see chart. Feedback welcome. P.S: If you live in the U.S....don't forget to set your clock back one hour!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hello Moneda, Can you please tell us on what indication you based your long decision? This will help me focus in (I need all the help I can get today). And -- where do you get all those cool animated icons? Thanks much!

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Jeff, How are you doing? Okay, let us deal with the most important question that you had....the emotions icons...that is an easy one. If you look at the taskbar above the area where I/you would type a reply...click the down arrow next to the happy face. Now your next question...I went long based on several things: The 4hr was well above the 23.6 are heading up The 15min had momentum and heading towards the 76.4 The 30min was at the 50.0 level a bit flat but if the 15min continued up it would follow it. Remember Spud's comment about the higher time frames being a series of smaller time frames? The 60min flat but well above the 23.6 Price above the 21sma and the 84sma Upper Bollinger Band point up and opening up with plenty or room between price and the top band Price above pivot line with room to spare until meeting R1 And most important of all.....Itchy fingers I see that trade as an Escalator to Pip strategy except that the MTF are well above the 23.6 but pretty much together. I exited at 1:05pm for +10pips - $.92 commission. I am not always that systematic with my trades. Sometimes is just a combination of the method and gut/experience feeling. The question now is....will I sit on my hands and not risk my gains for today? HELP!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Mo, This late in the day on Friday, I would not risk it. I got stuck in one on a Friday and when my platform opened back up on Sunday night, I was minus about 250 pips. Fortunately, that was on a Demo account, but it was a lesson learned. I can get you some Cortaid to help that itch!! Besides, it is the WEEKEND!! There ya go Jeff, lots of emoticons!!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Pip, I will not be needing the Cortaid today... I looked at my week's results and I was a bit dissapointed with my profits so my hand began to itch...Just one more...but I purposely distracted myself with a couple of chess games online and the urge to scratch went away!!! Thanks for the reminder. Have a great weekend! Were you piloting this one?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Moneda &amp; PipAV8tor -- Hi guys, Nice trade, Moneda! Glad you ended the week with a profitable trade. Personally, I could not trade today (though I really wanted to), was feeling a bit out of focus and, in fact, went to sleep right after I asked for your details! I'll take it easy over the weekend, and hopefully regain both my strength and trading confidence for Monday's session. I missed trading the last couple of days. I felt that I was on a roll, so I wasn't pleased about having to interrupt my own momentum. Thanks for all your correspondence these two days -- it's kept me tuned in and helped make my recovery much more pleasant! Have a great weekend!

I'm old but not quite that old. I actually did fly the aircraft in my avatar. That is the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. My "motto" used to be "Don't bother runnin', you'll just die tired!", but now I',m into pips, not lead. :

Hi, I've just become aware of this thread and I'm quite attracted to the elasticity concept - trouble is I'm a real dumbo on computers ( and some other things too} and I wonder if someone wouldn't mind explaining to me in very simple terms how to combine different stochs time periods in the same indicator window. Thanks

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Bundubill, Do you already have the MTF Stoch indicator? If not you will find it here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...icator&amp;page=54 Post #806 To put different MTF Stoch timeframes you must first open one window with your first MTF Stoch (15min) then the remaining three all you need to do is go back to Navigator, select the MTF indicator by clicking and holding the button and dragging it to your first window and change the timeframe in the INPUTS TAB. Good luck

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi everyone, This is my first time posting in this thread but before I posted anything I wanted to be sure I understood what I was looking at in regards to Spud’s methods. This post will not be about the traditional MTF method or Escalator to Pips, but rather another method that Spud put together called “Spuds Stochastic Thread Theory”. If you have not yet read it I encourage you to do so at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=37111 This is going to be e lengthy post so please bear with me while I get through what I am trying to get across. In the end it will hopefully come together nicely. One thing that Spud advocated with the Thread Theory was following the trend and taking trades that were in the direction of the primary trend. Yes I know it sounds like common sense but how many people actually do it who knows they should do it? But the biggest question that many people ask to this day is “how do we know if the trend is continuing or reversing?” Well the simple answer is we don’t. And if you know for a fact that it is then you must have a crystal ball to tell you so. But how important is it really to know that the trend has ended and reversed direction? When we are given the ability and the tools to trade in the direction of the primary trend and when the time is right and the charts are screaming at you that there is a correction occurring that may produce some nice profits? Yes boys and girls there are times that the charts will scream at you. I have even on occasion been smacked by my charts…lol Ok so how then do we determine the primary trend? Well I don’t know how you do it but I will tell you how I do it. On my chart you will see a 55 EMA. You will also see the Stochastic indicator setup just the way Spud says to do it in his thread “Spuds Stochastic Thread Theory”. With the exception that I use different colors for my own benefit. The Bars at the bottom is the Stochastic Thread Elasticity indicator. The lines are levels. The same levels spoke about in his “Spud's Multi Time Frame Strategy Guide” thread. The colors in the background are nothing more than colored rectangles like the gray one that appears in the chart area. All I did was stretch them out across the long haul. Someday I may have to stretch them again…lol. I like to use the 55 EMA to provide a visual reference to what price is doing at that time. Usualy (not always) when price is trading above or below this EMA the market will trend in that direction providing entry opportunities in that direction. But that is not the only thing we should be looking at. We MUST look at PRICE ACTION to help confirm what the market and the indicators are telling us. On this first chart (Daily EUR/USD) we are clearly in a bullish trend. But wait what is that we see? That’s right boys and girls it’s a double top. Now this is a clue but not a be all end all for a trading decision. Now look closely at what the “Stochastic Thread” is telling us. (Ok from hear on out I am going to call it the Rope cause the term Thread gets confusing) So the Rope has converged in the overbought zone and a peak as formed indicated by the blue arrows. I do not have the ability to sit in front of the charts all day long so I like to position trade using he Daily for direction and trade setups and scale down to the 4H for timing my entry. So looking at this same point let’s scale down to the 4H and see what is happening. I left the blue arrow so you can see where the daily chart showed us the completion of the peak formation. But look at the indicator on the 4H. It is coming unraveled so we wait for a better entry signal. In my personal trading experiences I have been fortunate o choose the correct direction of a move the majority of the time but lacked the timing. I would tend to get into a trade too early and get stopped out only to see it move in the direction I originally anticipated. If you are like me that is really frustrating and can have a really bad effect on your trading mentality. Ok back to the trade. Shortly after the unraveling we see the Rope converging near the upper area near the overbought zone and moving in unison. A peak is formed indicated by the salmon colored arrows. Now I am a big chicken S_ _ T when it comes to entering a trade and prefer the market prove it is going to go in or continue in the direction I am anticipating. So instead of entering a market order at the close of the next bar, I enter a sell stop indicated by the horizontal line at 1.3712. Why here you may ask? Well quite simply it is a few points below a recent support level which f broken would be a good clue that a move downward is underway. However I must note this type of trade is not taken without taking into account previous areas f support and resistance. As you can see the second bar after the signal was given entered me into the trade. Ok so now monitoring the trade we can see that a couple days later the rope is producing a nice elasticity formation. The turn of the elasticity is indicated by the second salmon arrow. Again I am not big on entering at market so I place another entry below the most recent support at 1.3630. And low and behold 2 bars later I am entered into the market again with 2 trades working. Great now I am in the trades; but how do we get out of them? Well look at the vertical yellow line. This is where I would have exited both positions without question. Why would I do that? Well that answer is simple. I know the primary trend is up and that I have caught a nice move that may have been a correction or it could be the development of a bearish trend. Either way I really don’t care. But what I do care about is on e daily my rope has converged again but this time in the oversold area and created a peak. I am no dummy because like Spud said “when all the threads converge something is going to happen.” So I get out and run to the bank. And as you can se the primary trend picked back up and continued to become a great bull move. Incidentally this trade produced 272 and 190 pips for each position taken respectively. I hope this example helps someone with their timing and understanding on how to combine the basic tools that have shown to us. Trend Direction Price Action Support and Resistance And timing our trades with the use of the Stochastic indicator One last note for those of you wishing to learn more about how to combine price action to your trading toolbox I highly suggest you read the James16 Thread. Happy trading folks the markets will be opening soon. Best Regards, Trader_V

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello Trader_V I've been doing some experimenting with these methods and believe it have great promise. There were great trades last week for GBPJPY and USDCAD using the stochastic rope. Do you have the elasticity indicator that you are using in your charts? I can't seem to find it and the Spuds Stochastic Thread Theory thread does not seem to have it the way it displays on your chart. Thanks, CanuchCT

--- 帖子 #178 ---
High Canuck, Here is the indicator that I have. Also I attached the Template that I use on my previous post. I dragd he elasticity indicator on top of the Rope which is why they appear in the same window. I also modified the appearance(color and line thickness) of the elasticity. Hope this helps.

Good morning, Jeff, are you ready for some Fo..... Hope you are doing fine. This week we have friends visiting us from Colorado so over the weekend I have been reviewing the Thread method. I think I am going to base my entries on the 4hr and fine tune it with the lower time frames. At present we have some elasticity.... I am going for the rope!....hopefully not around my neck Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Good morning Guys, Ya, I'm feeling better, thanks! Still have a good week or so before I'll be back to "normal" but I'm watching my charts this morning, geting back in the groove, and ready to trade if I can find a good setup. So far, I'm watching six pairs, but don't see any inspiring stoch setups. Prices are moving against the longterm trend, and I see lots of long wicks, so I'll need a good solid setup to convince me to get in. Regarding the rope, I've looked at this in the past but can't seem to wrap my little brain around it. I seem to prefer watching individual discrete lines rather than trying to identify patterns drawn from graphic images. Perhaps this is due to my general inexperience and my inability to identify the best time to enter and exit, so all the threads may be clouding my simple thoughts, and I suppose I would prefer to learn the basic fundamentals really well before I try to interpret ropes and threads. Nevertheless, I'll attempt to revisit during the week and will try to spend some quality time with it. That said, I'm also watching one chart based on boxingislife's "bringing sexy back" stochastic system template, which is also based on MTF Stochastics, and seems to compliment Spud's system nicely. In fact, Spud had mentioned this system as something he followed and considered it worth looking into. It is quite simple to interpret and looks promising. Good trading everyone!

Hello Moneda, I like your charts so much. Can you post your templates? Thank you Sure Pluto, Here it is:

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hello all, Is anyone interested in chatting via Yahoo Messenger - we could set up a group for trading MTF stochastics, threads and maybe those bringing sexy back stoch setups. When we identify a very good setup we can post it here to keep this thread going. I'm thinking the group would be small...say 10 - 15 people. And the focus would be only for those using stochastics as the primary tool for trading. I work full time (for now) so for me it would be early mornings and evenings. Others might be able to trade during the day. Any interest? CanuckCT

Hi Canuck, Funny, I was just thinking the very same thing this morning! I'm in -- Only thing is, I don't really know how efficient it will be with so many folks. But I'm definitely willing to find out. We could do either text or audio. What do you think? EDIT: I trade 9am to 12 noon EST and stay at the computer until 3:30 PM in case something interesting happens.

Pluto, No problema.....Here it is:

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hey guys, I had followed Spud's original threads, back when they were active, and I had traded MTF stochs with fairly decent success a few months back. For some unknown reason, I then branched off into other techniques with mixed results. When this thread started up, I thought it might be the right time to get back into the MTF stochs. I have posted a screenshot of my first return to MTF stochs. As you can see from the picture, this is the GBP/JPY earlier this morning. I had seen the fall in price from the London open, and that price had come all the way down to the S3 pivot point. Then price had been trading sideways a bit, with the M15, M30, and H1 stochs all under 23.6. There was positive divergence on M15, M30, and H1. It was heading into 8:30 am EST, which is always a good time to be looking for a retracement of the move during the London session. A quick fib study suggested that 238.00 looked like a good target. It was close to a 50% retracement, a 61.8% retracement, a 38.2% retracement from a higher point, some pivot points, some prior lows, and it is a psychologically signifcant number (ends in .00). I went long at 237.51 and set my take profit a little before 238.00. I exited eleven minutes later at 237.94 with +43 pips. Price has pushed considerably beyond 238.00 now. I am just trying to be happy with my 43 pips.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hello Moneda, thank you for sharing your great templates. I have a problem with the template from post 159. When I load the template on to my charts, only the candle window will show. I am probably missing the indicator that you have used for your stoch. window. Thanks for your help Regards

Here is a trade I took using H4 and threads. Threads close together and moving above the 20...23.6 level. Waited to be sure they would clear in an orderly manner. + 80 so far, 55 locked. And I have to confess I took a few bad setups today...thinking i had to trade. It's getting better though. This trade makes up for the smaller losses. 20pip stop for the stupid trades earlier today.

Hey Tommy, Thanks for joining our thread, and for posting your chart. It's so nice to see you here! At the risk of sounding like an idiot, can you please explain what you mean by, "...positive divergence on M15, M30, and H1?" Hope you'll stay awhile...

For those of you following boxingislife's terrific "sexy" stochastics system (he's a very funny guy), here is a perfect setup from earlier today. 20, 50 and 100 had all crossed their signals down, great spacing between them. Cross of 5's down after retrace into overbought is signal to go short. Was looking for that all morning, and the moment it finally set up, my phone rang; two long calls later and it was all over. Would have made up for my dismal loss on a less worthy setup earlier in the day. Anyhow, I thought it was worth sharing. This is how it's supposed to look.

Hi CanuckCT, Jeff and Moneda, You guys are doing a great job! Keep the thread alive, I have been following this thread and been lazy I think this sysem is simple and you follow it, you'll make pips. Look at these trades just earlier, I did not take these trades, yes everything looks great in hindsight... as I typing I have closed a trade on demo, where the last bar is bearish on the far right of this picture, all stochs are pointing down (bit of a risk, I don't think I would have took this trade on live account) and closed 18 pips + spread, that would be enough for me for one day! The key to this system, is watch one pair (2 pairs MAX - this is where and why I made mistakes, too many pairs and then forcing trades) and keep an eye on that pair, when you see the setup, take the trade, take the pips... log off and be done for the day! I think mantra is the key: # don't force a trade, it will go against you, # if you miss a setup, get it out of your head and wait for the next setup # dont watch too many pairs, mistakes will occur # don't over trade, if you end up with negative pips, don't try and win them back, be done for the day and get ready for the fight the next day. I am not an expirenced trader, but am learning, will take some time. Anyway enough of me rambling... look at the setup below... it happens all day long, do a back test and you will see! Regards, Guess

I caught part of that move on the EUR/USD. Got in at 1.4653 and out at 1.4635 for +18. almost missed it. Was watching the CAD/USD. Looked like it was setting up for a sell, but took off straight up for about 150 pips. I wanted to get in but just couldn't do it. Stoch on the 15m was hovering around 80 and turned up instead of down. Glad I waited. There was no indication or announcement that sent it soaring, as it happened around 2 pm CST. Correction, the CAD/USD is now up 400 pips for the day.

Hello PipAV8tor, There should be more nice trades on this pair in the coming weeks...Canadian economy doing very well, surpluses everywhere, but the stonger the loonie the worse off re trade with US, our biggest trading partner. This is at I believe a 50 year low, or something like that, so it should provide some nice volatility in the coming weeks and it decides what to do now. Some are saying we are at a bottom and if that's true could be a nice bounce. I'm not so sure about that and don't care. Just want to see it moving and take a piece of it. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi Guess, Thanks for joining us and for posting your charts! Nice setups, especially trade #2. I don't know if I would have taken #1 or #3, though, since the M5 was hardly over 50 when it turned around. Much safer to have the M5 come down from overbought, above 76.4 (imho). When the stoch is in the middle like that it has room to move in either direction. Good trading, and thanks for your kind words!

Jeff, Positive or Negative Divergence can be a very powerful signal, if you can learn to recognize it. Here is a very brief explanation: "Divergence" happens whenever price moves one direction, but the indicator moves in the opposite direction. For example: POSITIVE divergence happens whenever price makes lower lows, but the stochastics makes HIGHER lows. You can see this on the chart I posted. On the price chart there is a white arrow following the collapse of price during the London session. During the same time that the price was falling, the stochastics made higher lows. I placed a white arrow under the significant higher lows to highlight where the divergence took place. So that's what divergence is -- price may be moving down (ie making LOWER lows), but the stochastics are actually moving up (ie making HIGHER lows). This is an early warning signal that the trend is about to change. You can't trade off of it by itself, but it is one of the pieces of information that can help. Going back to the trade I posted, it was a combination of 1) price falling dramatically during the London session, without any serious retracements; 2) price finding support at a pivot point; 3) price trading sideways shortly before 8:30 am EST; 4) positive divergence on M15 &amp; M30 stochs (upon review, the H1 line did NOT have higher lows); 5)M15, M30, &amp; H1 stochs all under 23.6, bunched together and starting to turn up. All of those pieces of information together gave me the confidence to trade, where no single one would have been sufficient on its own. Negative divergence is just the opposite of positive divergence. In order to have negative divergence, price will be making HIGHER highs, while the stochastics will be making LOWER highs. Again, this is just an early warning to be prepared for a change in trend, but it cannot be traded until there is some other form of confirmation. Additionally, whenever divergence is spotted, it doesn't mean that an uptrend will change to a downtrend, or that a downtrend is going to turn up. It could very well mean that the trend will change from either up or down to sideways (ie trendless). So, again, whenever you spot a divergence, whether it be positive or negative, there must always be some other kind of confirmation before a trade should be entered. If you want to know more about positive and negative divergence, you should read Alexander Elder's fabulous book: Trading for a Living. It really explains divergences in tremendous detail. There are three different kinds of divergences: A, B, and C. Moreover, you can use almost any type of indicator for divergences: MACD, RSI, and Stochastics are probably the most widely used, however. I really would recommend reading the book. Once you can learn to spot divergences, they will literally jump right off the screen at you, and can give you some really decent advance warning, so you can be ready to take advantage of the trend change at the very beginning. Hope this helps.

Jeff, I looked through the price action for the GBP/JPY for this week and I found two really good tradeable examples of negative divergence just within the last 24 hours. Take a look at the chart, and if you have anymore questions, I'll do my best to try to answer them.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
PipAV8tor... Nice trade -- I'm jealous! I waited all day for that one but was pulled completely out of it by my cousin calling to see how I was doing. Ahhh, next time...

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Tommy, You're something else. Thanks very much for your crystal clear explanation. As usual, you've left no stone unturned. I have two of Elder's books -- now reading Come Into My Trading Room , and hope to get to Trading for a Living before year's end; lots of great material. Really appreciate your generous effort. Thanks again...

Here's another short trade I made this evening. Price had moved really far down during the day, blowing past all of the pivot points. Following the London close, price retraced back into a 61.8% retracement that was nearby a 50% retracement from a higher price level, as well as near a pivot point and some prior lows that could serve as resistance. Price then traded sideways for a while while the M15 and M30 stochs went OB. Then the M15 stochs turned down, the M30 and H1 stochs started flattening out, and price closed back below the daily S3 pivot point. I went short soon after the opening of the next bar. I was, at first, looking for price to go down to the 236.00 level, but I didn't like the way the H4 stochs looked. It looked to me like the H4 was flattening out and getting ready to go up. Consequently, I decided to take a more modest profit. I closed 45 minutes later with +34 pips.

Hello Pluto, Hmmm, not sure what is going on. Check your timeframe on your chart. The template is for 15min. This week is pretty busy for me but I will be more active in the forum next week. Ask Jeff to help you...he is very helpful. Good luck. Let me attach it again......

--- 帖子 #205 ---
moneda, I think that the issue is it is not enough to just post the template. You need to also post the specific indicators that the template uses. For example: if your template uses an indicator that he doesn't have, then it obviously wouldn't show up whenever he loads the template.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hello Tommy, I really enjoyed your analysis of the what each TF stochastic was doing and you thought process during the trade, including use of pivots and SR. Can you post additional examples of this as they arise? It's certainly something I need to add to my approach. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Not a problem Canuck. I'll be happy to. In fact, I'll post the pivot point indicators I use. Pivot points are a wonderful way to see potential support and resistance areas each day. They work so well because so many people use them to set their orders. Consequently, they become a self-fulfilling prophecy. But that's a good thing.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Guys, I've been watching this setup for about the past hour. Really looks like things are coming together for a sell situation. The 4 hour is still up but nearing 80 and could easily push back over, divergence with higher price but lower high on the stoch. The day chart is overbought and looks ready to cross. Anybody else watching? Update 8:00 CST: 1 hr has been channeling between its r1 and s1 all week, about a 300 pip range. the day ch just had a double tap at its r1 and is over-bought. stoch has crossed but is not yet below 80. Should be sometime in the next hour. The 15m and 5m are in re-trace positions at the 238.00 area. I think if this range (emotional) gets broken, it may fall like it did yesterday to the 236.00 or 235.00 level. Update 8:15 CST In a sell at 237.82. Wish me luck.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Canuck, I went ahead and whipped up a chart to show how pivot points can help provide a "roadmap" of sorts. Look at this chart of the GBP/JPY from just this last night. I put white arrows to show each place price reacted to a pivot point just since the London open last night. By using pivot points, you can get a good idea of where to place stops, and also where to anticipate price might find support or resistance. They are invaluable in placing take profit orders because, as you can see, price gets drawn to the pivot points like a magnet. Why? Because so many large orders are waiting at those levels.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Sold at 238.04...looking for 237

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Tommy, My pivots are off a bit from your levels. Maybe a time zone thing? I'm on Atlantic time. Thanks - I'm going to start using this today. Cheers, Ben

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Ben, It's not so much what time zone you are in, as much as it is what broker you use. I use interbankfx, and the charts I have are all in GMT. You need to find out if your broker uses GMT or EST or some other time zone. Once you find that out, I can tell you how to change the settings on those indicators to get the same pivot points.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Tommy, My broker uses GMT and I'm in Atlantic time zone - so I adjust one hour from the default settings and voila. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Banked 40 and moved stop to BE.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Support broken at 237.65. Next support 236.65 on the 1 hr. After that 235.65. I'm gonna try to stay in for a while, as I have no time conflicts and can watch. I'm trying to post a screen shot, but not having any luck. File is too big, but when I shrink it, you can't read it. Any suggestions. I'm not a computer guy, I'm a pip warrior!!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hey PipAV8tor, I moved my stop to BE and got stopped out. Did bank some pips but now it's gone the other way and turned into a very good trade - although any positive trade is still a good trade, regardless of the amount. So where, when and why did you put your stops and profit targets for this trade. I wonder if Tommy could comment also. Thanks CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Pipav8tor, Just beware of the daily central pivot point at 236.95. It is close to a major psychological level of 237.00. I'd expect some heavy resistance, if not a halfway decent retracement at that level. Good luck. I wish I had gone short when you called our attention to it.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Were it me, I'd set my take profit at the central pivot point of 236.95. Actually, I'd go for 237.00 since that is such a psychologically significant number. Of course you have to add the spread when you are buying, so my take profit would be at 237.10.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I do anticipate support right at 237.00. Same thing happened yesterday, before it went into the 235.50 range. The stoch's are still aimed down, so I am going to lock in some pips and see how far it runs. If I do get over 100, wish is within sight. I will get out and just watch the ride. Need to keep GREED out of the picture. 100 pips isn't just a good day, it is a good week.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Nice setup. Price around pivot, M15 oversold and turning up. M30 and H1 also pointing up. Take profit at first resistance. 100 pip move. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Still in the trade. Have a few pips locked away. Can't really go with a tight stop because of the volatility in this pair. Have been +50 or so a couple of times, but still waiting for the break of 237.00 I will exit when I can take my 100 as it looks to continue down toward 236.00 and below. I have tried to post a screen shot in word format and as a bmp, but I guess the file is too big. I'll get that figured out.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
PipAV8tor, Save the file as a gif file - it will be smaller and you can then attach it and it will display properly. I presume u are using Metatrader? You can right click on the chart, select "Save as picture"...save as a GIF and then you should have it. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I'll give that a try. Can't seem to do anything right now. Won't even let me try to attach anything and I can't even do a smiley. I guess i made it mad earlier. :-) I may need a reset or something. Oh well....

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I was wondering how many pairs everyone follows. I believe I'm going to follow 3 - GBPUSD, GBPJPY and USDCAD. I'm attaching a copy of my workspace. Two M15 charts for each - one with MTF stochastics and the other with Bringing Sexy Back stochastics. Was wonder how other folks manage their workspace and how many pairs they watch. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hey Tommy, I've tried pivots before but they never seemed to do anything for me. I now realize I had them set up wrong. Your pivot indicator is right on...when the price approaches the pivots using your indicators, they actually seem to be doing something instead of just a random movement. Thanks for the tip. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #226 ---
No problem at all. I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't. I found those indicators on another site and, whoever created them, seems to have gotten it right. I'm glad they are working for you.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hey guys, Looks like you're having quite a party! I love to see good trades in action, especially when we're all helping each other toward success. I was out most of the day, looking forward to trading again next week. I'm pretty tired, will post again tomorrow. So, I just sat down and found this perfect sexy stochs setup, just thought I'd share it. I'm beginning to believe that if you get a perfect sexy setup you are almost guaranteed a good trade. Seems to be very powerful! Once all three stochs (20-50-100) have crossed their signals up, wait for the 5 to reverse and cross it's sig up, too, and that is your entry. Signal here was perfectly timed, price still climbing as I post this. An easy 30-pip gain for those who were paying attention. Tiny spread on this pair makes it even better! Enjoy...

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hey, K2KV, thank you for starting this great thread. I'm posting this chart of the daily double top. I suppose everyone has noticed this?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Tommy, Thanks for the tip. Pluto, this time I will attach the indicators that you may not have in your platform. By the way, I have been very busy this week with just enough time to harvest my weekly average of 20 pips/day. I have a lot of reading to catch up with. This thread thanks to Jeff and everyone else is turning into a great place to learn about Spud's method and variations of it.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hello smikester, Do you have a stochastic indicator to go along with this since this thread is about stochastics. And no I'm not trying to give you a hard time...just trying to focus on stochastics. On the M15 using MTF stochastics, you'd have sold this around the pivot of 237.65 and would be smilin big time. See below. BTW, you still have a great trade in the works there. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I was in that trade yesterday, but when it made a big re-trace, I took my profit and got out. Left about 400 pips on the table. No way to tell that though, could have gone up 400 pips and lost my profit. Not a bad week though, I am +93 pips. I'll take that any week. My goal is to not give it all back next week. Hope you all had good trading as well and that you make the most of your weekend. My kids have soccer and birthday parties to attend and, as is the tradition, we have Friday Night Football here in Texas. I mention all this to remind everyone of what our real goals should be, trade to make a living, that gives us the time to enjoy are families and friends. Money comes and goes, time and the way you use it, is what is really important. I am done for the day, but I am already looking forward to my next trade on Monday. Have a cold one for me and I'll have one for you.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
hi Gem, good technique, but..... I want to know if you use the MTF Stoch. for both trend indications, i.e for a long and short indicator. If yes, then i want to know your data values for your fast and slow stoch. Asper myself, i think stoch. is a trend friendly tool and not used for no trend, either i use mu RSI. I want to hear your opinion. Thanks.. Sc.david

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi Smikester, Thanks for joining our discussion and for posting your chart. But I must agree with Canuck -- we're trying to focus on stochastics here. So if you'd like to share your trades with us, we'd want to know -- in addition to any other indicators you might use -- how you utilized stochastics to enter/exit your trade (even if the trade went bad). Hope to see you here often...

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi Guys, Took a nice trade this morning, based again on sexy stochs. Both 20 and 50 had crossed their signals down, there was wide separation and I entered at the cross of the 5's. My four MTF stochs were all oversold, the 15 pointed down (I keep these on another chart). Went short at 2.0964, exited soon after at 2.0934 with a +30 pip profit. Still playing the chicken, I exited 3 of my 5 lots at +17, took my final TP at +30. Should have stayed longer for a ride down to an additional 30 pips or so, but I'm not complaining. SL was placed just above S1 at 2.0994, and I had plenty of room before hitting any levels on the way down. A good confidence builder and a great way for me to end the week!

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello Moneda, thanks, I have it all on my chart now. I have a question for you; you are not using the default parameters on the Bollinger; is there any special reason? I am following this thread, and I think that all of you guys are contributing with great posts. Thanks to all of you, Cheers

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Great trading Jeff. I too have started looking at the "Sexy Stochs" thread. My question: I have noticed in your last several posts that you have shown pictures of your charts and they range from the 5 min to the 30 min. Do you look on the higher time frames first (such as the 30 min) and work your way down to the 5 min. or do you just scan each time frame looking for a setup? Thanks, T4K

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Pluto, Glad to see that your templates are finally working. Go ahead and use the default parameters . I basically use the BB and the 21sma(median on the Bollinger) along with the 84 sma for trend confirmation and direction.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Tim, I watch multiple time frames at the same time, on individual charts (5-15-30-1h-4h). Seems to give me a better perspective, and is easier than flipping back and forth all day long. Take care...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
CanuckCT I have been following this thread and I have read through most of SpudFyre's thread. But somewhere in all of this I have missed the indicator that shows all of the Stoch's. Could you post it, or send me in the right direction to Download it? All the ones that I have downloaded and compliled seem to be the wrong one. Thanks a Million, ken

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hello Ken, I presume you mean the indicator that adds the 4 different TF stochastics to one chart. There are a few versions of this indicator. Here is the one I use. I'll also attach one of my templates. If you have any problems with this...let me know. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #241 ---
A sell on GU - 25 pip trade - Bring sexy Back stochs got me into the trade...otherwise I would have not entered. But the MTF on M15 also looked week. Entered with a tight stop and took 25 pips. There were also sells on EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPJPY and EURCHF and buys on USDCAD, USDCHF...all would have been profitable for some pips. Lovin this stochastics trading...soom time to put some real money in play. Cheers and best of luck for the week. CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Nice work my friend, You're very brave to be trading Sunday night, especially after that big gap -- I bow to you. I have good feelings about this week -- Please be smart, stay out until we get good, clear signals , and -- let's all make some money!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
k2kv: But I must agree with Canuck -- we're trying to focus on stochastics here. Yes, and I must apologise for "bursting into the room" like that. CanuckCT: And no I'm not trying to give you a hard time...just trying to focus on stochastics. Ditto, and delicately put, thank you. My trade today, so far, has been as below. I entered short at 228.95 which looks considerably late. The reason was the unstable movements prior where it looked as though there might be a reversal. Additionally there was an important UK news announcement which I wanted out of the way. I waited for cable and USD/JPY to position themselves favourably and then opened the trade. TP was a modest 30 pips because I was seeing support all over the 228 area. In the event it was a very quick trade and price went down into 227's. Annoying but ultimately stress free. Of course, this is a success. I will post a failure if you are interested.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hello to all, I have been kind of busy but I am back. I am pleased to see that this thread, thanks to Jeff, continues to grow. It is also encouraging to see that we are all trying to follow Spud's method and at the same time finding our own identity. Now I have to catch up to you guys! Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Jeff - I just grabbed a quick 10 pips in E/U based on "sexy stochs". The setup was a bit in the gray area but it work out for a "quicky" before work. Take care... T4K

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi Smikester -- Great trade! A classic rubber band trade based on elasticity. Thanks so much for sharing. Bad trades are also most welcome. While none of us wants to experience them, we learn at least as much from bad trades as good. As a group, we can usually pull them apart to figure out why they went bad and that definitely helps to keep us out of the next one. Btw, 30-pips is not so modest. You can live quite comfortably on 30-pips per day; what's more important is how many lots you trade. Thanks again...

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi Moneda, Welcome back -- we missed you! Now -- get to work!!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi guys, I've placed three trades today, all +pips, all small gains. Here is my last trade, a nice scalp based on Spud's "Quicker pips" method. 15-30-60-4h were all sitting at the bottom of the tank, all oversold. M15 was at the top. Once it turned back over and hit the 76.4, entry was confirmed. Actually, I entered a little early as I was simultaneously watching the sexy 5 cross it's signal, so I suffered a few thumping hearbeats as price soared 15 pips against me before settling down and going my way. Entered at 2.0610, exited at +9 pips just before price hit the 2.0600 level; left some pips on the table as usual, but price bounced back up, and I'm happy to be in the money. Have fun!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
CanuckCT, Yes that is the one. Thank you for both the Indicator and the a setup! many pips to you, Ken

Hi people i was a spudfyre follower too. i hope to stick with this thread now cos i love stoch.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hello Jeff, Nice trade but I tried to duplicate the chart you show and I could not come up with the same situation. You say that the 15/30/60/4hr were oversold then you say the 15 was on top(overbought). Did you mean the 5min and if you did I still dont come up with the same chart. My 5min only comes up to the 50 level more or less. Is it that your broker is not gmt+2 like mine? or is it something else? Here is my chart. White is the 5min.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Sometimes you sit down and there it is...the setup you always look for but don't find that often...whether it comes in the middle of the night, or while you were out. This is the type of setup I look for and I believe it has great potential with little heat. M15, M30 and H1 all bunched together and just coming out of oversold together on the spud MTF. H4 also pointing up, if ever so slightly. Within 5 to 10 pips of the next bar it was clear to me that everything was pointed up together so I went long. Also had confirmation of the stochastic threads...not a rope but very orderly. And the trigger line (green) on the bring sexy back stochastics was also heading up...the 5,3,3 is a pretty good indicator of the very short term move. Have protected 50 pips which makes up for a couple of bonehead plays earlier today. Been looking at shorter timeframe trades...but a nice trade on the hourly can make up for a lot of small trades on the M5. Just stopped out for 50 pips. It would be nice to find a handful of these each week. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #253 ---
CanuckCT, I see that you've incorporated both Spud's and Boxing's indicators on one chart. I was comtemplating doing the same. Have you noticed an advantage with both on one chart? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hello Rialto, I've been tinkering with my charts and I think I'm finally happy with the result. My chart setup now is as follows: M5,M15 and M30 have boxing indicators and spud MTF H1 - boxing indicators, spud MTF and spud threads H4 - boxing indicators, 4hour stoch at 14,3,3 only and the boxing indicators I just change the time frame and everything adjusts to what I want to see on that time frame. I have found a lot of conflicting signals on the lower time frames and it did mess me up today a few times. Spent a lot of time today on lower time frames (M5 and M15). Price action on M5 seems to help with entry for setup identified on M15. Not sure I like anything lower than M15. My current thinking is confirmation from the three setups on H1 (the lowest TF for threads) and that I believe is a very high percent winner. Where there is confusion I'm either going to go just with MTF stochs or go to M15 and trade that TF. If is unclear I need to work harder at standing aside. Time will tell... Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hello smikester, That's near as good as it gets for spud MTF setup. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Thanks CanuckCT. I really like Spud's Thread Theory on the 1 &amp; 4HR charts. It would be great if he stopped in and said hello.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Here's a trade that, literally, just fell into my lap. I had logged into my platform just to see what the price action had been, and to get a little idea of what the London session might do tonight. (The London session is about the only session I trade.) When I took a look at my sexy stoch template on the M5, I saw that the 20 &amp; 50 had crossed down, following a great shooting star candle that formed at a major psychological number (228.00). This had come after a pretty nice run up after the asian open. I figured that it was due for a retracement, and the candle formations were showing a lot of small body candles as the 20 &amp; 50 stochs were continuing to fall. I went ahead and entered short in anticipation (I know, I know -- I'm supposed to WAIT for the signal), and it has turned out very well so far. At the time I took the screenshot I was up 42. I am still up 19 riding through a minor retracement. My TP is at 226.20, just before the 50% retracement level. That would be 106 pips if it gets there. We'll see.

Here is a sell setup I took...was up 20 pips and it moved against me so I scratched the trade....still looks like a sell and I may get a better entry. CanuckCT

Hi Moneda, You have a good eye. Sorry for the error -- it was the 5M that was oversold, not the 15M. The chart itself, however, is not incorrect, just the line definitions. Corrected, they should be 5-30-60-4H not 15-30-60-4H. I had no trouble replicating the chart for (below) with just the 5M and 4H shown for clarity. Although best viewed on a 15M chart, when viewed in a 5M TF the MTF stoch lines move differently but still demonstrate the same endpoints. That is, except for the 5M which is accurate here since this is a 5M chart and the way I'm set up, my shortest TF line is always the current TF. In other words, when I change the chart TF to 15M, the first (shortest stoch) line becomes the 15M stoch. When I change the TF to 60M, the first line becomes the 60M stoch, and so on. My broker is GMT. I have no explanation for why your chart differs from mine. The 5M clearly went into overbought; If I'm not mistaken, I was chatting with another trader at the time of the trade, and pretty sure he saw what I saw. No smoke, no mirrors http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Hope that helps... EDIT: Unfortunately, old habits die hard. I've mislabeled the 5m line on the chart below as 15M! It is, in fact, the 5M. It's past my bedtime!!

Here's a trade I took at the London open tonight. Looking at price action leading into the London open, I saw that price was making a double top formation, right at the 61.8% retracement level from the previous day's move. Moreover, that double top happened to be forming right at a significant level: 228.00. The M15, M30, and H1 stochs were all overbought, but the H4 was oversold. This looked like it could be setting up for a rubber band trade. Other signs that price would likely be heading down is that there was negative divergence forming on the M15 stoch. I went short @ 227.73. My initial take profit was 150 pips down, but the subsequent price action made me nervous. There were some long lower wicks on the down candles. That made it seem like price was having a hard time falling. Additionally, the H4 stoch, while still oversold, was turning up. Consequently, I decided to let discretion be the better part of valor and close out with +61.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Jeff, Thanks for the explanation. I have no explanation for the difference in our charts either. Perhaps the difference has to do with our broker's platform (gmt vs. gmt+2). I have read elsewhere in this forum that the candle formation can differ between brokers depending on their geographical location. Maybe it also affects the stochs. Anyway, the important thing is that you made some pips. Is there anyone outthere that can explain the difference?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Tommy, Very nice trade...nothing wrong with 61+ pips! Your chart analysis are very helpful and it sharpens our own. Thanks

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi Tommy, Very nicely done! But if I'm not mistaken, I seem to recall from previous conversations that you're located in the US. How do you manage your time so that you're able to trade the London open? Are you up all night? Do you sleep during the day? Take naps? Set alerts? I'd love to trade that time period, too, but can't seem to figure out a workable (tolerable) plan. This is a common problem for many of us who would like to trade the London open but are geographically disadvantaged. Much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I found this interesting pattern. I'm sure it's caused by scalpers like violins in an orchestra. I actually took two trades from it myself (small lots) just out of curiosity - 20 pip SL and 20 pip TP. Incidentally, I do not usually trade off the M1 M5 M30 H1 set, but use it to help entries. Similarly the digital readout at the bottom.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thanks Jeff and Moneda. Jeff -- You are right. I am in the US. Texas, to be exact. So how do I manage to trade the London open, you ask? Well, I just don't get a tremendous amount of sleep during the week. That's really all there is to it. For example: last night I went to bed at about 10:40 pm, but woke up at 12:30 am to watch the market leading up to the London open. I then watched the market, monitoring my trade, until about 3:30 am when I finally went back to sleep...just to wake up at 6 am to go to work. That's about average for me: 3-4 hours a night from Sunday through Thursday nights. Needless to say, I REALLY look forward to the weekends. Sleeping in on Saturday and Sunday are just heaven. I don't want to be so sleep deprived, it's just that the London session is the most volatile and active. It's the best time, really, to trade forex. The asian session isn't very predictable, and my job doesn't allow me to trade the New York session. Moreover, I have tried to trade from a long term perspective, off the H4 or D1 charts, but that doesn't suit my temperment. I am much more suited to short term trading. I don't like to watch my positions go against me much. I want to get in, get 30-50 quick pips and then get out. I have dreamed of being a full-time trader my entire adult life. Nothing worth having ever comes easy, so sleep is what I sacrifice to pursue my dream and my freedom.

Hello smikester I like your approach here...how about M5, M15 and H1 traded from the M5 chart. I'm liking this one for 10 to 15 pips with little heat. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Tommy, So, that's how it's done -- YIKES! I've thought about getting up in the wee hours but can't bring myself to do it. I'm able to trade the NY session, so I'm trying to wring as much out of it as possible. Thanks for revealing the real "secret!" I admire your strong will; follow your dream. You're well on your way...

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Canuck &amp; Smikester -- Do you guys have a secret handshake? Nice charts, but would you please explain your strategy to the rest of us (entries, exits, signals)? I swear, I have no idea what you're doing, hope I'm not alone. Once it gets close to midnight my brain goes into under drive! Thanks much...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
k2kv, my intended strategy is classic spudfyre mtf stochastics. Anything else is experimentation with very small lots. I am lucky in that work at home so that I can keep my eye on the charts. I have a working knowledge of most forex principles but I am quite new to mtf stochastics. I found the clarity and confidence of spudfyre's ideas pleasing and when I flicked back through my charts it looked easy. The reality is something quite different, of course. I need a notice above my workstation saying "IT WILL GO". Spudfyre's short dialogue on stop losses hints that even if we are in the right set up, the initial risk/reward ratio will appear to be wrong for that first 20 pips - at least on GPB/JPY. That's why I keep looking at smaller time frames for entries. I hate it when a trade goes 20 - 30 pips against me in the first 15 minutes and it can happen a lot. When I studied the smaller time frames I found it is possible to ameliorate this problem and keep my brain in good health! When I read through your thread I was seeing people making the same mistakes, experiencing the same emotions as me and so that is why I'm here. To stop me spilling my coffee all over the mouse mat and stop me shouting at the screen - I am hoping you can all help me make it a bit easier.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Smikester and others, You have come to the right place!....We are all trying to make pips and keep our sanity. I am also using smaller timeframes. I have two charts on my screen. A 1min chart with 1/5/15 MTF Stoch and a 15min chart with 15/30/60/240 MTF Stoch. I watch the higher time frames for direction but many of my trades are based on refining my entries by keeping an eye on the 1min and the 5min. This has worked well for me (so far) but my discretion plays a role based on my familiarity with the pair I trade. One thing to keep in mind when using smaller time frames is that one may have the tendency to get a bit hyperactive because of the fast action. It can lead to premature entries/ exits and overtrading. This is one of the challenges that I am working on. The other is to stick to my initial stoploss. Sometimes it can be as much as 50 pips. This may sound high to some but with a volatile pair like the aud/jpy you need to give it some breathing room for those times that your trades goes agaisnt you. This is when money management is so important because if you are trading an amount beyond your comfort level, the fear/greed factor can have a detri-mental result in your decision making. Okay, I think I said enough....sorry for this long post....I hope it helps in some way.

HI. I am Marcin from Poland,that is my first post.I would like to say that is very nice to see so many people here helping each other,that make me feel beetter. I am sure we all can make big money with Spuds mtf method,we only need to wait for the best setups and be desciplined,chasing for 10n pips a day is very realistic and I ask you if you want to be profitable ,dont chase for big amount of pips,all you need is 10 pips a day and good managment with your levarage(pip value). If you dont mind I will post from time to time my setups :enter setup and exit setups,the bad one and the worse one as well,so everybody can lern something.Thank you for Spud and for you to be such nice an helpfull. that is my todays entry and exit with + 8.6 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
What make me to enter: 1h,30m,15m stochs lined up nicely and all crossed 20 line pointing up very nicely,they all were very close each other.I only take +8.6 profit because I didnt like the position of the 4h stoch,it was to high and looking like want to pont down,but +8pips is almost enough for my day so that is ok,i am happy. Please always look at the position of the day stoch,although it is not so important it give yuu the ideaa of the general situation and it is much safer to yuor trade be aligned with day stoch. Sorry for my english as I am from Poland . See you.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi Marcin, welcome aboard! Thanks for posting your charts; we are most interested in learning from each other's successes as well as failures. You setup was good. I traded it, as well, but I got in much too late -- just before the price reversed for a long ride down, and I got stopped at my -20 SL. Bad for me, good for you. This demonstrates why the best entry is often as soon as the stochs cross the line, not much later. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I think the best ideaa to learn from each other is to post the chart at the moment of entry because everybody can see how the stochs. look like at this specific moment,that is why I decided to post some more charts. Please, if You dont like my charts with entries and exits just say it and I will not to that anymore. Iwould like to see your charts at the moment of entry and exit,that is the way we can learn from each other and undertsand the most powerful,secure,most common paterrns of entries. These are charts from yestrerday. What make me to enter:15m stoch crossed 50 line and pointing up nicely,1H stoch ia above 80 line but what is more and very impotant it is ponting up as well,4H stoch is nicely looking up but I would prefer it above 80 but this position is ok because it is pointing nice up and is not flat,30m stoch. is ok but it would be even better when the candle bar is closed. So besically I was almost sure of winning 10pips,but I exit with+17 pips. I exited at the moment of 15m stoch, touches 80 line,that is conservative exit but as Imentioned before:dont chase for big amounts of pips,10 a day and you are a winner.that is very impotant.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Smikester, Be assured, many of us experience that same emotion. From my conversations, I can tell you that the club is rather large. This morning, for example, I let a bad Spud trade hit my -20 SL (I entered late, my fault), then entered another trade just ten minutes later, on a nice sexy setup. That second trade began to move immediately against me so I jumped out at -7. I never jump out at -7! It's an emotional thing -- the setup was good, but my previous bad trade was working its voodoo on me. As I write this, the second trade is now up more than +100, but I'm not in it!!!! How foolish of me. So, I'm down -27 for the morning, instead of up +100. How do I feel about this? Not terrific. But I'm earning my wings. Still learning how to take the ride. And tomorrow is another day...

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi Jeff! You are absolutely right,we have to remember that entries at the moment of crossing 20?80 line are most safe,because stoch have a littile place to move against us. you absolutely should not enter the setup you mentioned if it was a litille to late,because 4h stoch was not in good position,it was good setup but only for 5-10 pips and entries shoud be placed right at the moment of crossing 20 line but after the bars has closed.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Smikester,Jeff emotion,yes that is all about trading. I think Spud gave us the beautifull method which works ,our emotion make us to loose,so please try to choose only the best setups for now and you will see it will works.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I hope some of you managed to take this nice trade for at least 10 pips(but you could easily catch 20).When I came home it was a 15 minutes to late so I had to stay away. It was very nice setup for going short,you should enter just after 15m stoch crossed 50 line and look at the nice engufling bearish candlebar which gave another confirmation,very nice setup.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
It is really worthy to wait for such nice setup ,take your 10-20 pips in 10minutes and you are done for a day. What is more about taking only best setup is that you win almost every trade and your confidence is growing,you are happy and feel great,but dont let your confidence to make you belive you can beat the market because you dont,what you can is slowly bite the market .

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I'd like to review 2 charts. First the m15 chart shows a setup w spud MTF (I'm talking about the move up at the end of the chart). Have to be careful because the H4 is coming down, but in my opinion still very tradeable pattern because of the orderly way the M15, M30 and H1 come up from oversold and knowing that the pair is volitile enough to allow for catching pips on this type of move. As soon as H1 crosses the 80 I switch to M1 and look for an entry. The first red line is that point. This one is as good as it gets for a visual on the entry. On M1, the M5 and M15 stochastic are above the 80, and M1 falls to oversold and makes a sharp turn up. On the cross of the 20 enter long. It's a rubberband trade setup on M1 using M1, M5 and M15 stochs. This was was for 40 pips with no heat. Total time in trade - 10 minutes. There are 3 other tradeable pattern on this chart where the M15 spikes higher and then falls down with the other stochs and they are marked by the first 3 red lines. Switch to M1 during these moves and you'll see what I mean re using M1 for the entry. Thanks to others who are sharing lower time frame setup information - it seems to be helping me develop an approach for entry to reduce (but not eliminate) the heat on volatile pairs. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi Canuck! Thanks for sharing these charts with us. Your two-screen entry system looks very interesting, though trading the M1 tends to make me a little crazy. But it makes sense and is a classic rubber band trade, with modified time frames. Please let us know how you progress with this method. See you in the trenches...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Yesterday was a great day for shorts on GBP/JPY. Three set ups in my time zone. One just after the London open which was a fake. Not a good start to the day. I entered just as the H1 crossed down below 76.4. The M15 and M30 were already on their merry way. Almost immediately the trade reversed and looking at the chart now it's sitting there with a little dip as though it never crossed in the first place (calling me a liar LOL). This caused me to miss the next one completely, which was the best trade of the day. However, I took a great set up on the EUR/USD which seemed very slow and tame compared to the GBP/JPY My triumph was in the afternoon when I scaled in GBP/JPY with sell stop orders at 5 pip intervals, small lots. I left them to run and it was good to stay in positive pips when retracements occurred, taking up more orders as the trade returned to the right direction. Made a mess of the screen, though. Thank you k2kv for your post. I can definitely relate to that. Thank you also to moneda and marcin - wise words. Today looks a bit trickier and I might stay out. Here is the euro trade I took, yesterday:

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Looking like you are getting to grips with entries. I was impressed with the M5 M30 and H1 set up you posted and I now have that in my GBP/JPY profile as it isn't as jerky as the M1. I also look at the MadroGoldenFilter. This is a digital read out of a bunch of indicators, ma cross over, force, rsi and what have you. None of them are stochastics. It's very laggy, especially on the higher time frames. It lags on the M1 and M5 too. You see the price change direction, watch it trace that direction for a few bars, then the madro kicks in with a "go" signal. LOL - my eyes could have done that but I like it anyway.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
It is nice to hear you manage to trade 1,5 ,15 m.stoch.ruberbund. Personaly I think it could be dangerous and I agree wit you that the best pairs for that are these which are enough volatile (GJ)but on the other hand these pairs have big spread. I dont trade that way but when I have a good setup I always check the small time frames 1M and 5M to better tune my entries and I suggest everybody should watch 1 and 5M stoch when starting trade and when going out of a trade. Thank you for nice charts .

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Canuck, That is beautiful!....nice going. Thanks for sharing. On my lower timeframes (1/5/15) I placed a 68.1 and a 38.2 and use those levels for confirmation/filters. I find that the 1min can be tricky so I prefer to see it cross those levels for my entries. I got this idea from Endroute (post#52) and made some changes to fit my style... thanks Endroute! Oct 19, 2007 1:35pm http://www.forexfactory.com/customav...tar50532_1.gif endroute Pips for One Pips for All Member Since Oct 2007 Posts: 30 http://www.forexfactory.com/images/misc/im_msn.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon1.gif Very short term trades using Stochs Has anyone tried spuds scalping approach as follows. I started looking at this the other day and then got side tracked, and built a chart to start looking at it and all I have to say is WOW what a PIP machine on 5/15 and GBP/JPY even with the spreads . MTF Scalp Direction : You need not worry what direction the long term trend is in for this method to work, it works regardless of long term trend direction. Time Frames: either: 5/15, 15/30, 30/1H, 1H/4H Entry: Set a level line on your 14,3,3 stochastic at 61.8 and 38.2. Your entry/exit is always with the smaller time frame. The smaller time frame should be one step (one candle) ahead of the longer time frame for the cross or one step behind...or exactly the same. This is optional if you are conservative and a common pattern. However, you do not want the longer time frame ahead more than one step of the shorter time frame. On a long, whenever both tf's cross or are above 61.8, buy long. On a short, whenever both tf's cross or are below 38.2 sell short. You can add greater risk if the longer time frame is "near" the cross in the direction of your trade. The longer tf should be across 50 level. This may prolong your trade and could add some risk. If you don't have this correlation of the 2 time frames, you don't have a trade. This is your filter mechanism. Exits: 1. If the shorter time frame goes above 80 on a long or below 20 on a short, you definitely want to be out before it re-crosses 80/20. 2. If you nab some pips within 3 candles on the shorter time frame, you may want to exit. 3. If the longer time frame is looking like it will go above 80 on a long or below 20 on a short you may want to ride it out. 4. If the trend is with your trade you may want to stick it out...use a trand channel. You will quickly notice an average pip gain, you may want to TP that. You need not worry what direction the long term trend is in for this method to work, it works regardless of long term trend direction.

Hi Moneda I tried thid method of scalping and this work but You wrote you use 14 3 3 setings for stochastic and I think Spud sugessted to use for scalping 5 3 3,I am just curious what you think about it......probably both settings works. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
hey all , check out gbp/jpy , it might turn out to be the perfect setup for spuds escalator to pips , all 4 tfs are in oversold , with 15m crossing the 20 line , wat adds to this setup is the daily chart wher the line is jst crossing up the 20 level too , do check it out , might gives 100-200 pips ...

--- 帖子 #288 ---
On my chart GJ the 4h is coming down but do not even reach 20 line and the other stoch. are below 20 pointing up.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hello, Going long on this set up. Not concerned too much about the 4hr. crossing the 76.4....(flat for the moment after its last closed candle at 5:00am est). There might be a bit of retracement but I will hang on for it bounce back up. We will see....

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Moneda,could you say why you enter ,I think it is too early entryand very dangerous.look at the 1h stoch,it not even touch 20 and the 4h pointing down,I hope you time your entry with 1 and 5M,good luck

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Marcin, My reason were: The 15/30 were out of the oversold area although barely so. Price action had penetrated S1 level..which was acting as resistance....although not a completed 15min candle. It also broke through my trendline on the 15min chart Daily range has reached and gone beyond the average for this pair. My 1min and 5 min were above 61.8... I prefer between 38.2 and 50 So.......yes I agree that is a risky trade and I am down 40pips but as I mentioned in a previous post, I give my pair around 50+ pips breathing room... I just hope that I can breathe easier by the end of the day! Is it not very revealing to put your trade before you know the result? ...just took a look and now I am down 25 pips.... Hope this helps in some way.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Moneda Thank you ,now I know the way you thoughts and I can learn something from that. I was considering to enter this setup as well but it was not good enough for me,be carefull ,I think the 15 m stoch wil go up a litille more and then cross 50 down and go down to join 30M and 1h stoch somewhere in area of 20 line,so I would get out of that trade, Thank you.

k2 change the price field in the stochastic settings from high/low to close/close it shows a stochastic that is more in tune with where bars are closing aside from good slopes on 20 and 50 stochs, look for slingshot trades and that is when the 20 and 50 are almost "decked" above 80 or below 20 and the 5 cross in their direction.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hello, Well my first trade did not end up well, partly because I had to leave the house which forced me to place an exit price. When I came home my exit was triggered ..for good reasons.... but finally my initial setup or should I say, a better setup based on my initial premature entry was there and I went long again. This time I doubled my $$$ amount and was able to recoup my money except for $1.76 + $.92 commission. I am not recommending my strategy to anyone except those with strong hearts . Anyway, I prefer to share the questionable trades because it brings the kind of transparency and perspectives that helps me and hopefully others. Like Popeye said " I am what I am"....the challenge is to find a workable method that complements the way that I am wired as well as improve my "wiring system"....I just need to make sure that I don't blow a fuse . Good luck to all

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Marcin, Sorry, I forgot to answer your question .....I don't necessarily consider what I do scalping although I am targeting between 5-20+ pips (after spread/commission) this is partly why I don't use the 5 3 3 ( a bit faster). At this point I don't want to change my settings....I am trying to keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I was thinking of your trade and I like the fact that although this trade was qestionable you post the chart so everybody could see it and I am so happy that you almost break even at the end. As you saw my 2 trades today I manage to take +14.4 but only because I quit with litille pips and didnt wait too long,that is why I only aim for 10 pips a day.After I quit the price reversed and I thougt it should go down even more.I hope one day we can trade with more cfonfidence. thank you

Hey boxing, Thanks so much for stopping by to correct my settings and offer sage advice. I'm honored -- I feel like I've been to a master class with Segovia. Please come back often, very much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Marcin, We are more or less targeting a small amount that we can confindently trade consistently. I aim for 20+ pips per day and so far I am doing very well. The key is not worrying about what happens after we exit... it doesn't matter either way. I have a spreadsheet where I keep my weekly results..to keep me honest and on track. As I increase my account, I will decrease my risk and increase my mini lots. Anyway, I really appreciate your feedback. This thread is turning into a "one for all and all for one". It is not over yet ...I am halfway in meeting my daily goal. Jeff, You are turning into a sexy trader!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi Moneda, I can't really claim much expertise regarding the "trader" part! Actually, I am really enjoying the sexy trade setup. There seem to be more revealing setups and opportunities available, than there are with all of Spud's methods. That said, I watch for strong setups of both disciplines. I've spent lots of time becoming familiar with spud's methods and wouldn't let one knowingly pass just because I also embrace another. Of course, both systems utilize MTF Stochastics. So perhaps I am a sexy polytradist? Here's an example of perfect sexy trade I took this afternoon, after the London close. If you are familiar with the system, it is incredibly easy to spot a good setup. Note that in this chart I've implemented the close/close stoch settings suggested earlier today (see post #300) by boxingislife (the author of the system). An easy 30+ pips, more if you stayed. By the way, the second nearly identical setup would have also yielded nice profit, but the third apparent setup was not good (even though it would have given you a handsome profit), since the 20 had crossed back up over it's signal and -- as I understand it -- this would be considered a "no-trade." But, now that I've said that, the 20 stoch was still below the 20% level, so this might not have been an issue. Anyone care to comment on this? Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Before going to sleep wish you guys good entries. Thank you Moneda for your company today,apreciate your opinion. Feff I am not familliar with sexy setups but you make me to become curious about it so I am going to investigate it soon,but now I cant comment your trades regarding this method. Thank you

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Moneda I always safe pictures with my entries and exits and analyse it after the trade so I can learn from that and select the best and worst setups. I think that treating trading as a bussines (to some point) and having daily targets (as your 20pips,mine 10 pips)is very good thing because it keeps you disciplined.

Jeff, Polytradist...hmm...are you moving to Utah? . You have certainly aroused my curiosity with the Sexy MTF Stoch by Boxingislife. Do you find it to be a simpler approach than Spud's Escalator/Elasticity method? I am interested so keep posting your entries and I will try to get a feel for it. In my case, the increasing familiarity with the aud/jpy and sticking to Spud's method (with a few twist) has been an wonderful antidote to some of my inconsistencies. I can focus more on what is happening between my ears than before. I think I will take a break for the rest of the night, watch the program Survivor through my TIVO (the only way to watch tv) and get ready for tomorrow.

Moneda, Today, I believe, I had an epiphany... I was seduced into the gbpjpy pair by one of our regular contributors with whom I chat most mornings. I never trade this pair due to the volatility and large spreads , but I nevertheless took a quick trade, made a very fast 20 pips and was hooked. I had entered onh the M5 with sexy stochs and - blam - I was in the money. I would have made twice that, but -- and this is true -- could not change my TP target fast enough. Before I was able to click, my default target was hit and I was out, in the money! Now, boxingislife himself visited us today and suggested a new setting for the stochs (see post 300). I applied it and continued to look at my chart. Here's why I like this so much. See my M5 chart below? Every red arrow was a signal to go short. Had I entered, each and every trade would have yielded a minimum of +25 pips; two moved more than +100 each! If I were more familiar with this pair, I would have traded every signal, would have easily ended up with, in conservative hit-and-run trading, maybe +100 pips for just a few hours of afternoon trading. I love Spud's rubber band (and continue to trade it), but trading on pullbacks in long trends is a great way to spend the day. And the sexy method identifies those pullbacks really well. It couldn't be simpler. As long as your 20 &amp; 50 are clearly in a trend, the pullback of the 5's and subsequent cross back toward the trend is your signal to enter. Enjoy your respite. Live to trade another day. Take a look...

Jeff - I just looked at your chart above showing the shorts in the G/J. I then looked at my charts and the same moves started on the long side on the 5 min time frame shortly there after. The G/J is a nice pair to trade if you can stand the spread. I do remember it was Spud's favorite pair and rightfully so. Thanks, T4K

Hi guys Where can I get the indicators for the bottom two stoch indicator H4stochbar and the one above that? thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #313 ---
This is just too perfect an example to not review. Look at the M15...H4 is quite oversold and the M15 is rising and is very near the 80. So i open 3 windows...M15, M5 and M1 and it looks great. On the M1, M1, M5 and M15 stochs all above 80 and turning down. When you have 3 time frames and they all turn down together in an orderly fashion, this is where you seem to get the best trades with the least amount of heat. Here the entry would have been around 226.05. this trade would be up 140 pips as I'm writing this and everthing still say it could go further. S1 is around 223.90 and that would definitely be a profit target, with taking a bunch off by now. I did not take this trade...was out at a meeting and got home and it was done. But it was such a nice setup that I would have taken, I had to post it. K2 - 2 questions - the close/close settings for sexy stocks..is that just for the 5,3,3 or for all 3 stocks, and what the heck is a "sexy polytradist"? Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Tim, Yes, it seems that lots of experienced traders trade this pair. I'm going to explore and see if it will work for me. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hey funguy, You might try sending Banzai a PM. Just click on his name in that post and you should have no probelm getting to him. Good luck...

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Canuck, Definitely a perfect setup. Very nice, and thanks for sharing it with us! Regarding the close/close setting, I understood him to mean ALL the stochs. "Polytradist" - I made this up. It's a take-off on the word, polygamist . I used it to indicate that I was now embracing two trade methods. It was Moneda who called me "sexy! Blame him!!

Is there someone here that con do a little programming...I'm looking for a MTF stochastic alert. It would work like this... Sell Alert StochTF1 - 15 AboveBelow - Above Level - 20 StochTF2 - 30 AboveBelow - Above Level - 20 StochTF3 - 60 AboveBelow - Above Level - 20 StochTF4 - 240 AboveBelow - Below Level - 80 Buy Alert StochTF1 - 15 AboveBelow - Below Level - 20 StochTF2 - 30 AboveBelow - Below Level - 20 StochTF3 - 60 AboveBelow - Below Level - 20 StochTF4 - 240 AboveBelow - Above Level - 80 In the sell alert, if the H4 stays below 80 and the other 3 timeframe stoch are above 20 I want to see a popup alert or an e-mail. The buy alert is just the opposite. In addition to the popup or e-mail alert, it would be nice to have the option to put an arrow on the chart. If you didn't want to use all 4 timeframes, then you would put a zero in the timeframe and it would be ignored. I'm attaching the MTF Stochastic indicator that I use. I'm thinking the first step would be to have the 4 time frames calculate within a single indictor. Once you have that, then the array of data can be used for the alert. Maybe this is not the thread to do this...but I'm thinking it is. Cheers, CanuckCT

Jeff, You had an e PIP hany..... You are getting too clever with words! Yes, the pound/yen, I think they call it the geppy is like going from go-carts(eur/usd or gbp/eur) to a Ferrari. I have trade it for months and is a rush..... it reminds me of Dr.Jekyl and Mr. Hyde . In my case I have tone down my volatility to the aud/jpy where even if I enter prematurely or make a dumb mistake, it gives me the opportunity to come to my senses before I am down 100 pips+. Yet at the same time, it can turn around into Dr.Jekyl and give you the right medicine. If you have tight stops and are able to stick to your ideal sexy setup you probably have a better chance. I wish you well... I have a question....with the sexy, are you using the original entry rules by Boxingislife or the later adaptations by Mephe....? I am going to study it in more detail over the weekend...always willing to learn and adapt.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
. .I'm looking for a MTF stochastic alert. It would work like this... Me 2 Canuck! ... It would make my life easier. By the way your example was a beautiful set-up indeed. One thing I try to remember that the MTF stochs are continually changing until the candle closes so what one sees later on is not necessarily what you see during live action... Keep those examples coming! Thank you

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Good point on the stoch changing until the candle closes...I always wait until the cnadle closes on the 15 before identifying the setup is valid...then I look at the lower TF for pulling the trigger...at least that's what I'm trying to do. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Canuck, I have no problem with requests for help with alerts or indicators, etc. However, it is my intention to keep the subsequent discussions as thin as possible, so as not to interfere with the core focus of this thread which is, of course, trading the MTF Stochs. I want to maintain this thread in such a way that newcomers will not be impeded in their learning process, and I want to ensure that everyone interested in our core topic can easily move through the entire thread without being bogged down in endless discussions about ea's, alerts, and the like. So, all I ask is that, once two (or more) parties decide to pursue the creation of an alert, etc., you please take further discussions off the board until you are ready to share your creations with others. You can accomplish this via PM, email and IM, or you can even open a new dialog at Spud's original thread where indicators seem to have overpowered the trading methodology (the main reason I began this thread). Thanks very much for understanding...

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Moneda, Charts always look great after the fact. So I'll try to capture some live charts and encourage other to do the same. Here is a live chart of a trade I took for GJ on M15 with MTF spud indicators. It's not perfect in live trading. My thoughts were the H1, H4 and D1 were all down and the M15 looked like it was starting to turn. I was probably a bit early on this trade as I sometime am. It's how I get burned sometimes. You could have waited for the M15 stoch to complete it's turn and still made some good pips. The price had just bounced off S1 and looked like it was heading down. I had a 40 pip stop and my target was S2. It seemed to me that the risk reward was good and I went for it. The M5 wasn't too revealing for an entry as the M1 had already turned down and the M5 was on it's way down. Ma5 starting to turn but not as much as you like to see. Because the M30 and H1 remained oversold like they did was also part of the reason I took the trade. This trade was over quickly. This was a +60 pip trade. Next time I have a bad trade I'll post it also and encourage other to do the same. We need to post a few more losing trade and have a discussion about that...hopefully not too many. Cheers CanuckCT

jeff dont worry too much about the signal line on the 20 and 50. if its under 20 and crossed its signal line a bit then u can still take the trade as long as it stays under the 20 and it would be considered just a tad bit riskier than others and a possible trend change but should work just as fine. keep the stops in place or watch for sudden price changes. even if it fails it will 90% of the time give u a few pips or let u get out at breakeven before the trend changes. ill post some examples tonight of some nice setups and ill give some tips take care

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Boxing... Thanks so much for clarifying. Really looking forward to your input! Very much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
That is my trade on GJ which i made about 1 hour ago.(entry.exit) What make me to enter: 1H,30M and 15M stoch crossed 80 line and all of them had good angle and all together pointing down.I didnt like that the 1H bar, although crossed 80 it wasnt closed,but looking at the position of 4H,at the bottom at 20line,and the position of Day stoch.,below 20 line,I decided it is safe enough to enter. My drawdown was -42pips and I exited with +6.2 pips profit. I have to admit I am not happy with this trade and I exited because of pure fear and I am lucky because now I would be -115 pips. My conclusion is 1:I am not prepare to trade such volatile pairs as GJ 2:It was too early entry,I should wait for the close of 1H bar. What you think about this trade

--- 帖子 #326 ---
at this moment it looks like that...

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Marcin, I think what you were missing in that trade was that you were watching a re-trace, for the most part. The pair had moved up through a previous resistance pt., which turned into support once it was crossed. If I remember correctly, support was at 225.85 or so. Had it broken back through that support, it was probably good to go back to 224 or lower, but the support(previous resistance) held and it bounced up. It tested that support for 3 or 4 15m candles before it bounced up. The move up was partly due (also) to some negative/flat news in the US, which makes the dollar weaker again today and the GBP stronger, by default. I hope that helps. I was watching it closely at that same time. Update: Things may change now that the London session has just ended. Maybe 1 more good hour to trade before things start to consolidate.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
PipAV8tor You really helped me to understand that,my all attention was completely on stoch.behavior and I was sad because I was wondering why I didnt want to go down.Now I can see that suport,although I exited with profit I had to be more cautious next time,apreciate your comments.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Marcin &amp; PipAV8tor, Actually, the pivot was at 226.78. It's a good strategy to play off the pivot bounce, but I don't like to play when price is hovering all around the pivot, floating above and below it. That tells me price can go either way, no matter what my indicators say. And remember, stochastics are trailing indicators. They follow price, not the other way around. So, while stochs can identify a trend and in many cases foretell near price moves, prices drive stochs, not the other way around. They can change on a dime! That's one reason we always trade with stops in place. Earlier this morning I also took a GJ trade on good stochs, but price action convinced me to get out with a +5 pip gain after a -23 drawdown. I'm glad I did, since price reversed considerably. Then, I took a really bad trade on EURJPY with much distraction (phone ringing, emails and IM all at once) and didn't see the pivot right in front of me. Can't even tell you why I did that! Took a hit for -34, and now the week has pretty much come to an end. I love trading on stochastics. But, we always need to be aware of everything else that's going on. Glad you got out with your skin intact! Take care, have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I don't understand a thing. If both tf's are above 61.8 i'll buy? Or i'll buy if one tf is above 61.8 and the other one is crossing? This cross should happen one step ahead/behind? Check the below chart: http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/897/stochspo1.th.jpg http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/897/stochspo1.jpg Black is 5 min stoch and red 15 min stoch. The 5 min is crossing 61.8 level and 15 min is above it...is it a buy or not? I love stochs

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Jeff I completely agree with you,Stochastic should be our basis in trading,but we cant forget about price action and overall condition of market. It was good week for me,hope it was good for everybody. See you Monday , thank you.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Jeff, I think the 225.85 I had was off of the day chart. I wish I had gotten in for the buy now. I also saw the resistance on the way back up at 226.75 or there about and thought it would stop there. Blew all the way through to 228. and some change. Could have taken a hundred or more, but the stochs did not indicate that sort of move. I am up 66 pips for this week and a total of 147 for the month!! No complaints, obviously. Time for a beer and once again, we have playoff football in Texas tonight. Go Vikings!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
PipAV8tor Could you or someone else give us a lesson on support and resistance. I've been watching this rather closely as I make by decisions on whether to take a trade, but my numbers always seem so different. How did you get 225.85 as a support #? Everyone seems to use different support and resistance numbers. My pivot is the same as Jeff at 226.78. Is it the US close, london close, or something else that matters, and it is different for various pairs? And how does one spot a retrace? For this trade, price did just bounce off the pivot. On the other hand, H4 was on the move up and it you look at the candles chart...the trend looks up. I wasn't trading today but checked in right about this time (maybe a few minutes later) and was looking at a long on sexy setup and a bounce of the M15. When the stochs dive back down and H4 is making any move up, got to be careful with the trade and take profits quickly. It's not easy is it! Glad it ended with a positive trade. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I will go back and see if I can post some screen shots of what I was looking at. My trading platform has a pivot pt. tool that I plot on my 1 hr and my day chart. It "forecasts" some support and resistance info based on the daily pivot pt., which refreshes everyday at 5 pm my time (CST in the US). You have to look at both for confirmation. The one thing my tool does is also plot a mid-range number when the movement is say, between S1 and S2. That 225.85 may have been one of those middle numbers. If you throw any moving averages up to use with your stochastics, you will often see a 50,100, or 200 ma hanging out around one of the main or mid-range lines. Stochs are GREAT and one of my primary indicators, but I do have several other indicators that I reference, when I trade. Why would you just use a hammer and a screwdriver when you also have pliers and wrenches available? : I just try to stay on topic w/ the stochs for this thread. I have made buy and sell entires based 90% on the stochs lining up, but there are other opportunities to enter/exit that the stochs don't always show by themselves. Today's was a great example, as it looked like everything for the gbp/jpy was setup for a big sell off. I was almost in the trade, but looked at my other tools and I FORCED myself to wait 1 more 15m candle. I actually waited for 2 more , after I saw the 2nd rejection at 225.85. There were 3 rejections , the 15 m turned up and took the 30m with it and the buy was on. Fib lines are a great item to have on your chart, for reference. I don't totally understand why or how they work (it is almost magical) but they prove over and over again to be a great source of support/resistance lines and thus entry/exit pts. That's all I got for now.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Fellas.... How's it?!?!? Been out on the mash a little... (drinking) and thought that I would share some. There are loads of trades that you could have been in and loads that you can keep out off. If you are day trading, keep fibs (day fibs), that is where the support and resis is for the day, piv, R1, S1, etc. And also keep an eye on 1 hour, if you look, you will always see things bouce off and through this TF. Guess

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Marcin, You made 6 pips so it was a positive result. On that particular trade with the pound/yen fluctuations of up to 80 pips is not uncommon. If you are targeting 50+ pips then you are putting yourself in a position to experience those fluctuations. The 4hr was heading up out of the oversold area while price was going down. In a case like the one you faced I might have done the same thing but I prefer to trade the rubberband with the 15min and the higher time frames in the oversold area or near it.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hakuna, Hmmm, I don't have any recollection of posting the above. I don't even use 5,3,3 Stochs. Can you help me find that quote of mine?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
This is your post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=285 Don't look at 5,3,3 i'm just trying to understand if i can entry on a trade if the smaller tf crosses the 61,8 and the bigger tf is just above 61,8 or must cross both tf together the 61,8.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hakuna, After looking at the link above, I can tell you that the info comes from a post by Endroute that I copied to my post... Anyway, now that I understand the source.... Ok, according to Endroute: On a long, whenever both tf's cross or are above 61.8, buy long. On a short, whenever both tf's cross or are below 38.2 sell short. So... I would say that they don't have to be cross together. They just need to be above 61.8. He also says in that post that as long as the bigger timeframe is above 50, you can still consider entering although a bit more risky. Keep in mind that this are very short term trades 5-10 pips. You also need to keep an eye on price action, support/resistance levels, etc. Hope this helps.

Hello Guys... This was late Friday, would not have really traded, but just as an example, people are asking questions about fibs... I didn't know this, but read this myself... if I am wrong... someone can correct me Fibonacci levels to price charts, it is necessary to identify Swing Highs and Swing Lows. A Swing High is a short term high bar with at least two lower highs on both the left and right of the high bar. A Swing Low is a short term low bar with at least two higher lows on both the left and right of the low bar. If you do not the meet the above are they valid swing highs and lows, can someone confirm this? So here attached, take a look at the highs and lows, that's where you would draw your Fib line to and from and look where it meets the daliy pivot at 50% retracement... on the close where I have marked I would have taken trade and then drawn the fib retracement and I would have closed out there... hope this helps. I am just following on from my ramblings from my previous post Sorry if it sounds as if I am teaching how to suck eggs, I have made the many mistakes on taking trades too early, I am learning as well. For me stochs is the best, you just have to learn and master them, which I am trying to do. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Ok... Support and Resis, look at the hour chart and you will see... look at the thumbs up, everytime you break in direction you could take a quick scalp once candle has closed.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Ok look at this example and how 5 min stoch moving in 2 directions, up and down, affects price action, look how the 5 min pushes up the price as well and where we are now, I would wait for the 5 min stoch (another 20/30 mins of price action would have been nice) to see where we would have ended up, I think we could have gone Resis 1.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Good trading PipAV8tor...you are doing great. Two weeks positive with many more to follow! T4K

--- 帖子 #344 ---
thanks Moneda, i just make confusion between this method and Spud's Quicker Pipping

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I went for a quick 5 pips here, though was closed out on 6 pips... was a little chicken, could have waited and I could have been pips in, as price went up 30 pips or so... but am happy for 5 pips and I would be done for the day, 5 lots. I got in a little early, should have waited for the second cross and got in there, would not have had any drawn down at all. Though if you look at the charts the price was moving up, 1 hour was breaking through the daily pivot and was half way through closing (a bit risky trade, got to say) You can see price action... creating new lower highs and higher highs... and determined the trade for me... I don't think you can beat price action with stochs, it's great! I will post losing trades as well. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Guess121, I am not much for scalping, too risky and nerve racking for my blood. What I did see, looking at your last post, is that you were set up for a nice buy/long opportunity and you chose to scalp on the re-traces. You could have entered the buy and then hedged on the retraces, at least 2 were good moves, and captured more pips. The buy went up 30-40 pips, or so it looks and you could have hedged to scalp another 5-10 on the 2 bigger retraces. I tired that early in my trading days and it does work, but like I said, just too risky for me at this point, because you are never quite sure if a move is a retrace or a pivot. Good luck though and keep posting your charts.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi PipAV8tor, See this is where I am learning, Hedge against pairs or move/increased lots? When you are looking at retracements, what time frames are looking at for the retracements? If you can exaplin, that would be great Ok the other thing, I am using 5/15/30/60 min stochs on my chart, though I might move over to Spuds original 15/30/60/240 mins. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Here is the day chart from last Friday that shows resistance at S2 and why the trade for a sell did not develop and turned into a buy opportunity

--- 帖子 #349 ---
oops! I guess the better shot is too big. Enjoy the same picture for a 2nd time!!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you can read it, it shows the day before (thurs) and Friday both testing S2 at 225.82. That is why the day chart should always be referenced because you never know what you are "not" seeing. Ironically, the pair broke through that support today. Hope somebody got some of those pips, I was out of the loop.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I would definitely put the 240m in there. I would also highly recommend referencing the day chart/24hr time frame, as it is "big picture" and can be easier to view trends, support and resistance and pivots there. I use the 5 min chart to choose entry and exit points, as it keeps you very close to what is happening "right now". You would definitely want to use the 5 with the 15 for scalping/hedging purposes. I think each trading platform is different as to how to hedge. With mine, once I open a trade, I can click on the "flag" and select hedge as an option. The good thing for me is that even though it is a separate trade and I can close it out, it does not use more of my available equity, so risk management is not really affected, if I am making good choices. Scalping and or hedging is a lot riskier than even a normal trade and timing is VERY important. Like I said, I choose not to do it, although I have played with it. When I see a retrace forming, I will take my profit and just wait for the next opportunity. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi That is my entry whcich i made a couple of minute before on A/J. I exited with +1.7 profit.After I entered I realized I am just against a pivot and that is the reason I exited with only +1.7. Apart from that I think it was not so bad setup of stochastics

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Marcin, You may be correct in the short term but I am also looking at the 15min coming back up to join the 30/60 and the 4hr. heading up as well. Personally, I pay more attention to support/resistance levels than pivots.....and that could big a bad habit on my part. Happy pipping

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Keep in mind that pivots and S/R lines are not written in stone. If there is a reason, like an announcement, for a pair to move then they will blow right past that number. These numbers are more important in a long term trend, whether it is up or down. I like to think of them as stair steps, just to keep it simple for myself. It is almost like water trying to find the point of least resistance sometimes. No matter how many indicators and numbers you look at, sometimes you just have to use "feel". Nothing is 100%, as we all know. Ask yourself, can I get my 5 pips on this trade or should I wait for another candle? You don't have to trade. Wait for things to set up the way you like. There are SO many opportunities EVERY day, so don't force a bad situation. I haven't made a trade yet this week. As I look back, I see there have been many opportunities, but I did not see anything that I "liked" as they were setting up. Keeping the pips I have made is just as good as making more. I don't want to given even 1 pip back, if I can avoid it. Just some food for thought.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi Moneda Actually I do the same as you,I am using 4H an 1H support and resistance but I have on my chart pivots as well and when I see the price action(morning stars,evenings,long shadow,engufling,doji etc..) on this levels thats the nice confirmation for me.In this trade we are talking about,although the stochastics gave nice signal for buy ,it was barcandle with small body and long upper wick(on 1hour chart)just beneath pivots and that is why I decided not to trade it and quit with almost 2 pips.As I am looking at the chart now I think it was good decision(price has tested pivot 3 times and cant go through).

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Here are 2 setups I just traded. The first was a sell...since this was against the H4 trend...my target was small - 5 to 10 pips and I closed for 10 pips. A risky trade for sure. About 6 pips of heat on the trade and it was over in a few minutes. The second trade was a buy on the turn of M15 back up. Felt much beter about this trade. Target was just under R3 at 2.0670. Closed for 37 pips with 10 pips of heat. Sorry about the poor visual on the chart. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #357 ---
PipAV8tor It looks like your thoughts are very similar to mine,I didnt take a trade this week altough it was some opportunities but not the ones I feel comfortable with.I enterred only one trade today but exited very quickly. that is very impotant thing what you said about protecting the profit you already got in your pocket,not losing it ant waiting,waiting,waiting for the setup you like,you feel comfortable with .

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I watched the USD/JPY all morning. Although I could have been in earlier than when I got in, I pulled the trigger and took +32 pips in 30 minutes. A little scary because I thought I waited too long, but I waited for the retrace and got in on the 2nd breach of mid level resistance at 109.74 I think it will go further south toward 108, but I fought the urge to get greedy. +32 is good enough for me. For those interested, I still think the setup is favorable for further movement and the 4hr and day chart are in favor. It is retracing toward 109.74 again, but that should serve as good resistance. Good Luck if you get in.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Got to be careful with this pair on a sell. Now at lows that were tested in Sept 2005 and May 2006. Were nice moves up in each of those instances. See the monthly chart. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Canuck, There is definitely volatility in that pair, anything with the yen, for that matter. I am just saying that it is trending down nicely with the stochs in line. It would take some major "good" news for the dollar or "major" bad news for the yen, to reverse the current trend. Always trade wisely and don't take anyone else's advice. Make your own decisions based on your personal system or comfort level. The 15 m chart for today is text book for "safely" using stochs. I count 4 really nice moves up and down of a 50-60 pip range. It doesn't get much easier than that to take a nice 5-10 pip "slice" out of the middle. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is a trade I took last night: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I used a longer time frame trade with an eye on RSI on each time frame. I posted this http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...68#post1722568 earlier. I don't trade divergences as such but it confirmed my thoughts. There were two main entries scaled in and as you can see, the first one went over 100 pips the wrong way before coming back.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
that is my trade on GJ which I made couple of minutes ego,I exited +9.9. i took only a 2 or 3 minites and I could wait longer but didnt like the position of 30 m stoch and when I got +9.9 ,my daily target ,I just get out of trade. There seems to be some resistance and the price cant go through any further. It was nice trade .I appreciate any comment of yours. Thank you.

This certainly did go south to 108.24, nice call. Was watching it around the pivot wondering what to do...went to bed and then it fell. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #364 ---
No worries. My thoughts when I miss a trade are always that I didn't make any pips but I sure didn't give any back either!! The 'experts' think that this pair will continue south to 105.00. There could be a bounce off of 108 before it happens, but this pair is definitely in a down trend. Should be some more good opportunities soon.

As I learn a bit more about this wonderful game, today my revelation was about correlated pairs. On one trade I'm rooting for USD to go up and on another trade I'm rooting for it to go down as I enter simultaneous trades with EURUSD and USDJPY. Each had a reasonable good entry. I was +16 on one trade and scratched the other, but it took a lot of patience to get to this result and I probably got lucky. Was wondering how others deal with correlation. For me it's now EURUSD, USDCAD and AUDJPY. These pairs seem to be the most uncorrelated pairs. Does this make sense. Sorry about the off topic question...but these are the 3 pairs I plan to trade using MTF stochastics as I near the point of putting real money in play, so I guess it's on topic..... Cheers, CanuckCT

Looks like a good trade. Did you set a TP when you opened the trade? Sometimes when there is high volatility my broker makes it difficult to get out of a trade by giving re-quotes (which I nearly always decline because I don't have time to check the figure) when I try to close the order. Does that happen to you? I think having a daily target is a good idea. It would give me more discipline in my trading. This is something Spudfyre is very keen to advise. Some days are not good for trading, though. I wonder if, on those days, I might be tempted to take a dodgy trade. How do you cope with this?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I dont set TP and SL.I always watch the screen when I have the trade opened.I dont have any idea if some big boys are hunting but it hapened many times my SL was hit when I set it,so now I dont use it anymore unless I open a trade and cant watch it. I do not prefer any days for trading.What I do is that I dont take trade at least 1/2 hour before and after imporatnt annoucement,apart from that I trade every day from Monday to Friday(Friday not too late). It never happened to me that my broker requoted when I wanted to get out of trade since I am using Oanda (As I mentioned I dont trade when news are coming and that is the time the high volatility happens). I try to choose the best setups(the best in my opinon,which I feel comfortable with)which supposted to bring you 10-20 pips,but I try not to stay in a trade too long,when I have my 5-15pips I exit and having my daily goals of 10 pips keep me desciplined and make me not to chase after many pips and this safe me from loosing trade many times.

watch the EU,it could be nice short soon,when 4h cross 80 down with 15 and 1H,30M below 20line

try this one http://chivas88chi.wordpress.com

that is my today trade for +8 pips. I entered below yellow ,dotted line (daily pivot) and exited when price touched pivot line. 15/30M and 1H crossed 20 up and all have good angle,I know it was against 4H but I traded together with daily stoch.which crossed 20 line and nicely looking up. It was good trade when targeting a caouple of pips.I took only +8piops but it would bring you easily 15-20.

Here's an early morning setup I took... Price had clearly bounced off S1 and there was room to the pivot. Spud setup looked good as M15, M30 and H1 all pointing up. H4 indicates may be a small bounce o9ff a some type of bottom and no real resistance in site until 95.47, which is above the pivot. Chickened out for pivot as target and closed for 22 pips. CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Here's another early morning setup for usdcad. Price had cleared the pivot on M15, threads pointing up and a setup on sexy M15. On H1 threads pointing up nicely and on the H4 making higher lows. Small target because could be some resistance just above according to H4 and due to low volume re US Thanksgiving. Closed for 12 pips. Two trades closed for + pips...done for the day. Cheers, CanuckCT

Why are people chasing small pips with MTF Stochs? Most of my trades easily yield 40pips gain. I am having great success with MTF stochs. I have made 20 trades, only 1 was a failure. And I earned 3k using a 2k account! Please comment on my trades, help me improve on it. They are all posted on my blog INVESTKRIS

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Kris, We are glad for your success. I am assuming that this is a live account. Some people, including myself prefer a strategy where you increase your lots instead of chasing bigger pip gains. It also, most of the time, reduces your exposure to abrupt volatility swings thus reducing your drawdowns. Please share your trade set up in this thread so that we can all learn and make comments. Good luck

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hello Canuck, I have been trading the aud/jpy for the last month or so and I have noticed a few things: As the pound/yen, euro/yen goes so does the aussie/yen. If the aud/usd is up and the usd/jpy is up so will the aud/jpy and viceversa. Take care,

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hello Kris, Welcome to the thread...I see you have a game plan on your blog...nice and achievable I believe with a tremendous amount of discipline to stick with the plan. I have a similar plan in mind...but still in demo mode. Perhaps you could post some of your setups here and you will generate some discussion for sure. I do realize that you have a blog but I think many people don't have the time or inclination to go to yet another website for information. I have found MTF stochs to be very effective in getting you into a profitable trade. What I'm looking for is a better exit strategy as I often leave too many pips on the table by exiting too soon. Perhaps you could share some of your exit strategies. As Moneda indicates, many folks here are looking to increase their lots and go for smaller pips and this can be very profitable. Do the math - 40 pips a week from high quality setups...and increase your lots as your equity grows. That is certainly one approach that can work very well. But it's only one approach. I took 4 trades this week, all winners, in a demo account for a total of 86 pips. I figure I can make a nice living on that kind of result and that kind of discipline instead of the hype-active trading I was doing a while ago that would give it back faster than I could earn it. So what is your entry and exit strategy? Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I stumbled accross this MTF stoch indicator. Will be using it long side my other indicators to see what I like better. This one gives you the stoch for x bars for all time periods. It's interesting for sure. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Kris, I do agree with you that MTF stoch trades are routinely capable of yielding 40+ pips. I only trade the GBP/JPY and my default take profit is at 50 pips. I rarely go for less than that. As an aside, I went to you blog and was quite impressed with the trades you posted there. I was very impressed with your analysis. I also applaud you in your trading plan, and your very ambitious goal. I don't, however, mean to be a downer when I say this: I think you might be overleveraging your account. You goal was to start off trading 5 minilots on a $2000 account. 5 minilots x 10,000 = 50,000 worth of currency per position taken. Your starting account was 2,000. 50,000 position size/2,000 account balance = 25. Your account, therefore, is leveraged 25:1. That's an EXTRAORDINARILY high leverage. Most professional traders seek to reduce the amount of their leverage. Most shoot for 5:1 leverage or LESS. The main idea being that capital preservation is the name of the game. Keeping your leverage down will allow traders to ride through the inevitable drawdowns and losing streaks. One cannot trade if one has no money. I do sincerely hope that you achieve your goal, and I will be dropping by your blog routinely to check on your progress and to root you on. I do hope, though, that you give a little thought to possibly mitigating the size of your positions relative to your account balance. I have read before that overleveraging is the single greatest mistake that wipes most traders out. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
CanuckCT, You may have already looked into this but an exit strategy I feel works pretty well is to trail a stop 10 pips (+ or - depending on time frame) above or below the last bar after the 533 stoch gets below or above the 20/80 lines. Simple and price action based. Of course the stoch may not make it to the 20/80 lines. I use a 1xATR(10) trailing stop prior to the stoch getting to the 20/80 lines. Once in a trade, the only thing that gets me out is the ATR trailing stop or the previous bar hi/low. (I trade 4hr and occasionaly 1hr charts.) Matt

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hello Rochemb, Perhaps I'll try something like that. Often my stop will be half way up the bar and it get's taken out. One question.... You mention 5,3,3 on the H1 and H4 timefames...I've had a look at that using MTF stocks for H1, H4 and D and it looks very workable as well. So when you refer to the 5,3,3 reaching 80...do you mean 5,3,3 for the H1 stoch on H1 timeframe and/or H4 timeframe? Or something else.... Thanks so much for the idea on the stops. Right now I'm using a combination of trailing stop and pivots, S &amp; R for stops and targets. It's working, but just trying to improve. Since I'm now trading less often, the setups seem better and often look like they could run. So exit strategy needs some attention. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi Guys, To all the ppl using the mtf stoch indicator succesfully, I would really appreciate your response to my dilema. As an eg, on the 5m tf, you have the 15m, 30m, 1h, and 4h stochs. Now, at 10.05, the above stochs are all pointing down, showing an agreemen trade and are showing you where they will be when their respective times finish, ie the 15m in 10 mins, 30m in 25mins etc. You get the idea. But that is just an indication, and if price was to spike up and keep going up, come 10.15, the 15m could finish up pointing up way past the 5m stoch. Hope I have explained myself clearly. Now, when you look back at the chart, and if you mark an entry there, you would be told that the 15m stoch was pointing up, so it would not have been a valid entry, but you know that at the time it was a valid entry. This is my dilema. Any suggestions and help would be most helpful. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
CanuckCT, If I enter a trade on a H4 chart, I am refering to the 533 stoch reaching 80 on the H4 chart. If I enter on H1 chart, I am refering to the 533 stoch reaching 80 on the H1 chart. You bring up an interesting idea though. If you enter on the H1 chart, exit 1 lot based on H1 533 stoch and ride 1 lot with a trailing stop until H4 533 stoch hooks down. I haven't looked at this though. Matt

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Kermut, Assuming I understand your dilemma correctly, some trades simply go bad, no matter how valid your entry is. Stochs are great indicators, but they do not control price. Quite the contrary -- stochs follow price. Once you have a valid entry signal and decide to enter the trade, there is no guarantee that stochs (or price) will continue in any direction. They often do continue to move in a certain pattern, of course, and that likelihood is the reason we trade them. However, if you enter a trade based on the appearance of mtf stochs at any given moment and they turn against you -- or move in a direction contrary to your expectations -- it may be time to exit your trade. Note that your 5m stoch will change direction long before the 15m, not the other way around. Other indicators may influence your decisions as well, such as S&amp;R and pivot levels, MACD, RSI, etc. And, price may go your way once again, even after stochs initially turn against you. It's a tricky game, for sure. Hope that helps a bit.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hello rochemb, Are you trading with just a 5,3,3 stoch? And second, I have noticed that if MTF stochs are moving up together (H4 included), often you can ride the longer timeframe stoch up as well...in a trending market. I always try to look for M15 to H1 to H4. My problem is I get stopped out too early and then once I'm out I don't jump back in. This leads me to another question....has anyone ever used an indicator like ADX to determine if the market is trending. I'm thinking that when ADX is above say 20, there is a better chance to ride the higher TF stochs as well. I've put ADX on my H1 chart only to assess this and maybe keep me in a trade longer. So my thinking is this...use stochs to enter the trade and use ADX and stochs to determine is market is trending and whether I might want to stay in the trade using a higher time frame. And use some multiple of ATR for H1 timeframe to determine stops. Anyone care to comment on this? Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hello Kermit, I find that I consider where price is in relation to the daily pivot and S&amp;R levels and always consider those levels when I enter a trade. If keeps me fram trading a few good setups but lots unsuccessful setups. If you are using M15, M30, H1 and H4 stochs, it's usually a good idea to wait for the close of the M15 bar to assess the stoch direction, not at M5 intervals. Once you determine the setup is valid, open an M5 chart and look for entry based on either price action and perhaps the M5, M15, M30, H1 stoch combination. Don't worry about catching all of the move...you only want a piece of it. I've had some luck with that...but my current thinking is to back off and assess using H1 after the M15 TF indicates a good setup. But pivot and S&amp;R seem most relevant in my decisions. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #386 ---
CanuckCT, I am using 50-10-20, 20-10-20 and 5-3-3 on H4, H1 charts and try to trade in direction of longer term (daily) trend only. This approach definately limits trade opportunities but I can't watch charts enough during the day to use lower time frames and the higher time frame trades seem to have a high success rate if you can hang with them. I think disussing exit strategies is a great idea. The stochs nail the entry point pretty good but exits, as with all methods, are tough. Taking some profit with one lot and letting another lot ride seems to be best compromise of the many ideas out there. There will always be trades that continue on without you after being stopped out but I haven't seen a way to prevent that. Hopefully stochs present another entry on a pullback if that happens. Your idea of using the ADX is worth looking into. Matt

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Canuck, Good advice to both Rochemb and Kermit. On the issue of additional indicators for filters, i.e., ADX, etc., many folks who follow stochastic methodologies also add RSI to their arsenal. I'll be using it this coming week to see how it performs for me. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hello Rochemb, I've been searching for an exit strategy and here is one that is promising. Add a 5SMA (I read the the 5SMA best reflect the price movement) to your chart based on the closing price. Then add the attached GannHi-Lo indicator - default setting of 10. It seems to provide an interesting way to trail a price. I'll be adding this to my charts to help with a visual for trailing my stop and exit strategy for this week and probably ADX...but I really don't like the clutter of too many indicators...that is what got me interested in stochs to begin with. Cheers, CanuckCT

Look at this chart,it looks like good setup,nice elasticity trade with 15M snaping back to 4H/1H/30M being below 20 line. I entered this AJ trade on Friday and lost 60 pips.I would be a winner at the end but due to my account size 2500$ I couldnt waited any more as I think risking more than 2% of account per trade is very risky. Look at the second chart,it is about how my traded developed.At this moment I even added to my loosing position as I thought it is almost perfect setup,but it was my fault as I broke my rule ,never adding to loosing position,and when the sprice went against me I exited at -60pips,I wouldnt exited this trade if I had bigger account,because the 4h all the time was very flat and below 20 and 1H followed 15/30M very slowly so you could suspect that at the end all stoch will join 4h. after I exited the priceimediately went south.it was painfull it went your way after exiting. Look at the 3.chart.I would make nice profit. Take your lesson from my loos. My lesson is : never adding to loosing position,being aware what drawdown yor account can stand.

Hello As I remember from Spud's thread he suggested to observe the behaving of stochastics evrey day just to practice and not getting rusty. Mayby you can help me as I am looking for some kind of program which can record the stochastics movement so at the end of the day you can watch how stochastic were moving all day long in just 1 or 2 hour,so yuo dond have to spend many hours before screen to practice. I cant find in the thread what program he sugessted. I would be very thankfull for help.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
my today trade with +10 pips profit,very nice and clear setup of elasticity trade,its my favourite. Look at the the 4h/1Hs stochs.they are very high at 90 line,1H flat and 4H pointing up a littile,it cant be better. 15M just crossed 50 line and togrther with 30 M pointing up very strongly with the bars being closed. Safe and guick 10 pips. I wonder if anybody feel like me,that I almost trade elasticity and rarely agreement trades when stochs lined up.I have never spoted clasical trade with all 4H/1H/30M/15M moving together in one direction.I can see very rarely this setups from time to time but at the moment of forming I just dont. That is just my thought.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Here is I trade I'm currently in...threads forming a wall and pointing down, spud M15, M30 and H1 all pointing down and somewhat of a sexy setup (although the 20 stoch is pointing up slightly). My target is S1 or 1.4757. However, because the H4 stoch is not below 20 and is pointing up a bit, I'll be careful with close eye on the trade. Also seems to be support at 1.4785...so my target is 1.4805..just above the round number of 1.4800 and above S1. When I get to +20 I'll move stop to BE and then let it run or stop out. Currently +15. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I entered a sell on AUDJPY earlier today...sold at 94.17. Was up 18 pips and moved stop to BE because I couldn't watch it. This is against my own rules which say move to BE after trade is +20. Anyhow, I got stopped out for a BE trade which is ok, except that this trade would now be up 100 pips. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi Marcin, I would have exited this trade as soon as the M15 turned back up to the 50 level. Some trades go bad, no matter how good the setup, and there's no point staying in when the setup no longer looks good. Watching price move in your direction after you've exited is something I am all too familiar with, as are many others I've spoken with. I feel for you. But it's part of the game, and over time you must learn to ignore it, and only be concerned with your own unique trade -- whether good or bad. Be confident in your exits, as price will cycle up and down all day long afterward, with little regard to your trading action. It appears you had not set a specific stoploss when you entered the trade, either mentally or physically. Trading "on the fly" will surely kill your account before too long. You must find strong levels of support or resistance (or some other method) behind which you can hide your SL in a manner suitable to your account size and risk acceptance. If no such level exists when your otherwise great setup shows up, you should pass on the trade until a better/safer opportunity comes along.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi Jeff It is true that spoting good entry it is easier that exiting at the right moment.My exit rules are based on stochastics behavior.I look how they moves with relation to each other and in relation to price.my initial stop is always 50 pips and later I adjust it depending on conditions.Spud gave us a good idea about exit strategy and I am trying to do the same.My stop SL is to protect my account not bad trades and it is rarely hit.I absolutely agree with Spud. Of course nobody is perfect and this loosing trades shows clearely my lack of discipline.Sticking to the rules I supposed to exited when 15 crossed 50 line up and definitely when 1H/30M left oversold area,but I did not and that is why it was my first serious loos from 3 weeks.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
my second trade today for +10 pips. it is example of agreement trade,but it is faraway from classic setups. The stochastics are quite messy,not tight,and that tells me that the up moves will be weak so I am aware I am chasing for 5-10 pips. I exited when 15M stoch crossed 80 line and the price was aproaching pivot line.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
that is my last trade today for +7.8 pips . The 4H stoch position was not good but it was very flat so I decided that it is safe enough to grab some pips.I liked the daily stoch.which was well below 20 line and flat. This trade would bring you over 100 pips and the price is still going down.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I mentioned in an earlier post a trade for AUDJPY that I got stopped out of...I was up 18 pips then 15, and I moved my stop to BE thinking that this was enough room for the trade to work. When you are trying to do 3 things at once this is the kind of result you get....stopped out for a break even trade on what was an excellent setup. My entry was a bit early...I should have waited for the price to close below R2 and then enter with a 40 to 50 pip stop. Would not have got stopped out...M15 and M30 proceed to oversold and H1 followed as did H4. And with pivot and S&amp;R levels to help with exit points along the way this was a big trade for someone. Then when it bounced off the pivot it created another good entry with all 4 stochs heading down together, expecially when H4 passes down thru the middle like that. This time S1 and S2 were the levels. And the stochastic threads confirmed a steady move down and they were very orderly all day. I can see it now...and didn't have the time to focus on it today...left wondering how I would have handled the trade. I hope someone got some pips from AUDJPY today, it was a great setup and the pips were ripe for the taking. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi Canuck, Looks like you'll have another shot at it in a few minutes. Setting up nicely if you're sexy M15, still nice if you're a spud. Price is now retracing a bit after tha long run down. Watch it fall again as it bounces back from the 21ema. I may even take it myself, despite the time of day! GL...

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Here's the chart -- All stochs down, 5 overbought and soon to turn down. Be aware that a demark 9-bar has formed on the H1 chart, which is an indication that the downtrend energy may have dissipated.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Well, I'm going to pass. Just too dead right now, no action at all.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Here is a trade I just made...used a little different indicator. Less noise. Price was making a move below the pivot and all 4 stochs pointing down. Because m15 and m30 were already oversold...my target was prior consolidation area about 30 pips away rather than S1 which is off the chart. Closed for 29 pips. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi Canuck glad you made 29 pips,but for me it seems very dangerous to enter the trade when 15/30M are already in oversold area especialy when 4H is curling in area of 50 line.I dont like the position of 4H,as I made in the past some loosing trades with 4H stoch position llooking like that,but that is only my opinion,do you consider it as a safe trade? all the best.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Marcin, This was a risky trade...but aren't they all. My intention for this trade was to exit quickly if it didn't go my way. Total time in the trade was 20 minutes. Price action was moving down and I was a bit weary of H4 as well. But H4 is quite lagging. I've been paying a lot of attetion to this pair to learn how it moves. When I look back to spud stochs it does look risky there. But this indicator was not pointing up. It was pointing down. So this was likely based more on price action around the pivot with stochs influencing the trigger...I did reduce my position for this trade as I was not 100% committed. Now I'm done for the day. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #405 ---
that is what I thought,that your entry was more based on price action(below pivot) and your good grasp and experience with this pair. I am + 7.5 pip for now but my trade was definitely a scalp trade so I dont post it .

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hello marcin I'm thinking if we ignore price action, especially when price is around pivots and S&amp;R lines, we will sometimes miss opportunities and enter bad trades that a strict interpretation of the various entry criteria dictate. And we'd be missing the boat regarding the "art" of trading MTF stochastics. Everyone has a little nuance to the basic rules that works for them, time frames, type of stoch, etc. and many of these are good for the person who uses them. I'm now experimenting with 8,3,3 for the stochastic settings for M15, M30, H1 and H4. It's a little quicker than 14,3,3 but not as fast as 5,3,3 and got me into a few good trades last night during the asian session. Just a thought. Cheers, CanuckCT Going live before Jan 1, 2008

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Canuck I agree with you. that is natural that everybody when entering the trade is trying to look for possible many factors(price action,S/R,Pivot,candle patterns) which all together are in agreement and that is the way to maximize safetynet of trade. But for me the first think to look for is good setup of mtf stochastics,that is the first and most important think.If I spot one is coming I analize price movement:where it is in relation to pivots ,S/R,moving averages,how much space has the price to reach this price levels.I always trying to spot important candlebars which shows the feeling and emotion(long wicks,doji,morning stars,engufling,,etc). When stoch setup is good and the price dont have obstacles on its way and there is a planty of space to the next important price level,and in addition there is some emotion bar,that is for me high probability trade. We supposed to trade only such high probability trades but having all winner trades would be so bored

there is posibly entry long on G/U at the moment good for 10 pips

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Marcin and Canuck, I agree with both of your premises. We need the discipline to trade situations where all or most of our conditions are met and yet at the same time we need the discretion to improvise when the market compels us so. MTF Stoch has provided me with the framework from which I base my decisions but I am also making an effort to develop an awareness of the present moment .... price action. Wouldn't it be awesome if we could find within each of us what the Tin Man, the Lion and the Scarecrow were missing? .... Where is the Wizard?

Guys, Beautiful setup on this pair right now. 15m,30m,1hr, in agreement and 4hr is overbought and ready to turn. Good luck if you get in.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Currently +13 pips w/ 5 locked in for profit. Looking to run down toward 109.65 if it breaks through at 110.00. +23 now with 10 locked in. One last update, price retraced and I got stopped out with my +10. I still think a move below 110.00 is going to happen, but may not be enough market volatility until the Asian session opens in about 4 hrs.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi PipAV8tor, Thanks for sharing this setup with us. In fact, there were an unusually high number of excellent setups today, on nearly all pairs. Lots of activity, too, so late in the session. A great trading day -- unlike yesterday! Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
My trades from today 1.U/J +8.6 2.G/J +8.4 3.G/U +5.1

--- 帖子 #420 ---
just made very quick trade for 11.8 pips on U/J

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Marcin, Nice going!... I think that K2kv also traded the same pair for + pips!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Guys, Based on the recent announcements, the JPY looks to be strong through the Asian session. The stochs are lined up pretty well and there may be some really good opportunities. Good Luck if you decide to trade.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi all, Just thought I'd post two examples of the bringing back sexy setup on the recent usdjpy charts. Chart on the left shows a perfect short trade setup. Traded for +8 and got out when the 5 stoch crossed down into oversold. Time of day means relatively light action, and the 5's didn't have too far to go, so that worked for me. Chart on the right is an example of a good long setup that is not quite as perfect, with the 5's about to cross. Angle was not steep enough to give me confidence, so I passed, even though it turned out to be a great trade: +15 or so as I write this. Have fun!

I exited,that is my personality,didnt want to wait for price reach the pivot. firtst exit +10 pips,second exit +10 pips, hope you trade it with me.this was my first clasical trade and it was realy something beautiful,so nice to trade

--- 帖子 #429 ---
just made quick +5 pips on AJ,that was elasticity trade with 15/30 joining 4/1H however I would prefer 4H and 1H to be a litille bit higher,daily stoch was at my favor,I could wait but that is just me

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Marcin, I am in the same trade with the aud/jpy but I am planning to stay with it longer.... the feds strong inclination to lowering the interest rate may give us a significant bullish day today...we will see. Since you are targeting 10pip (+/-), how do you come up with your stop loss target? Thanks

--- 帖子 #432 ---
next trade for +7pips on U/J,that was very similar setup to previous trade,elasticity trade with 15/30 joining 4/1H wit daily pointing up. Each of trades could make easily 30-40 pips .I made + 5 and +6.4,I need to wrk out the better exit criteria and fihgt my fear of loosing

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Moneda ,it is time to exit AJ ,it reach resistance from 1h chart

--- 帖子 #434 ---
my SL criteria are combination of pivot,S/R from 4H and 1H chart,but I keep an aye on longer times frames as well,but primaly I watch behaving of stochastic.I am doing what Spud learn us in his thread,that is the matter of fimiliarity of stochastic movement and how they affect each other. My bigest problem now is that my most trades are thw winner but from time to time I have a loosing trade as well and this lost is bigger than winner trade,that hurts me but there is a lot to be improve in my trading as you see my entries are good for 15-30 pips and I exit with 5-10 pips,anyway I am very happy with my result

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Very interesting thread guys. I have but one question with regards to elasticity. Does the 4hour has to be in overbought and oversold area for elasticity to work. And, does it have to be up or down with the direction of the elasticity itself. Right now i'm following the USD/Yen and all indicators are oversold or very close too but the 4hour chart just crosses overbought pointing down. Thanks so much in advance guys. Amazing thread. REally

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Fearless! According to the rules, the H4 should be overbought/sold. We occasionally trade (or push the trade) when it is somewhat out of this area, but your risk increases the further H4 is from where it is supposed to be. When trading elasticity, you are trading toward the H4. The idea is that the lower TF stoch is "snapping back" to the H4, thus the term, "elasticity." It is also often referred to as a rubber band or slingshot trade. Hope that helps. Thanks for joining our discussion, and good trading to you...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Fearless, I am afraid that is not an elastic trade. It looks to me more like an Escalator to Pips once the 15/30/60 come out of the oversold area (20) and heads towards the 4hr. With this particular trade you would be going with the 4hr trend which makes it safer trade.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Thank you guys for your prompt reply. I was under the impression that trading towards the 4hour is called elasticity. I could be wrong. However, my main concern here is does it matter which direction the 4hour stochs is pointing. Meaning, in the example im working on the 4hour stoch dropped from overbought heading down. If all our other timeframes start coming out of oversold towards the 4hour chart, does it matter if it was still pointing down rather than sideways or pointing upwards. Thanks so much in advance guys. I do forex all day everyday for years, and i must say this thread is very impressive. I have been following it for couple of weeks now, and friday was the first time i used the elasticity method, and i had a good 45 pips profit. So i'm pretty excited about all of this. I also have been using another indicator with the stochastics that react before stochastics, and it has been good to me in the past. If anybody is interested i could share it with who ever wants to know. cheers

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi. You can trade elasticity in many ways,I sugest to read Spud original thread. I prefer the 4H to be oversold/overbought but I think it is nothing bad to trade when 15M is crosing 50 line and moving to join 30M and 1H in overbought/oversold area and the 4h has crossed 20/80line and and pointing in the right direction. The example is the chart U/J rightnow.,I exited this trade with +5 pips. If you are still in the trade be carefull because there is the resistance which I can see from 1H chart and 30M has left oversold area which is the sign to consider exit.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
thanks marcin. Just to make sure i got this right, you were shorting that trade as soon as the 15min crossed the 50 line heading south to the 30 and 60min stoch. Do you use 50 line as a filter before entering your trades. I didn't enter any trade yet because i was only looking to go long when i see the atleast the 30min crossing the oversold area. Thanks

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I made 9 pips on G/U now,it looks like it have space to go down much further

--- 帖子 #442 ---
..

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Yes Fearless,you got me right,I use 50 as a filter. I attch chart again,if the 30 wouldnt left oversold area and there wasnt be resistance there I would trade it.I like trade such setups(for 5-15 pips) but having 4H in oversold would be safer .

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I went long G/U exited +9.1,still opportunity to go,but I am out

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I just made some review of my trades and took some very simple but I think important notes,conclusions: -dont predict what stochs will do,wait wait wait until they show you which direction the price will move -choose only the best setups,there is enough good oppotunities -trade with overall trend,dont trade against 4H -the safest setups are when stochs just crossed 20/80 -be cautious or dont trade when 4H,1H is somewhere around 50 line and curling and dont want to show any direction -when trading only 1H/30M/15M agreement trades wait until 1H close below/above 80/20 - dont trade against daily stoch. when trading only 1H/30M/15M agrement trades -dont trade when price is just against strong resistance( it could sound funny but I did make such simple mistakes ,because all my attention was only on stochs) -dont tarde when price is choppy and there is small movement of price -dont trade friday after 15 pm, -dont enter before going to sleep,before going out -when you reach your daily goal of 10 pips it is better to not to trade any more or picking up only perfect etups -protect what you won -risk only 2% of your account per trade -be cautious on long wicks -you dont look for reason to trade ,you look for reason not to trade It could sound funny because what I wrote is such obvious but keeping that in mind and following this simple rules helped me to start earning money on forex.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Interesting thoughts, Marcin25, thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
My dear friend Moneda, Sorry, but according to Spud, an escalator to pips trade has all four stochs ob/s together. To quote the great one, "Long trades are entered when all 4 time frame stochastics are moving upwards and the solid lines are all above or at 20." Elasticity does indeed refer to the action of one stoch "snapping back" to another. I know it can be confusing, since I often have to refer to my stack of printouts to figure out what kind of trade opportunities are in front of me! Have a great week...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
there is long opportunity on G/u,but news in 1/2 hour are coming,i am hesitating..

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I just exited +7.8pips

--- 帖子 #450 ---
very quick pips,at the moment of entry 1M and 5M stochs were pointing up nicely and still got space to 80 line

--- 帖子 #451 ---
long opprtunity on G/U.a litille risky because against R1 but I take it

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I just exited with +3.5,the price is in one place and dont want to move at this time,that is why I exited

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Dear Jeff, You are absolutely correct..... I should be more careful with my labels. What I was really referring to is one of the 4 Basic Trades per Spud which can be found here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...03#post1466003 In this particular case the trade was a Long Climbing to the 4hr. My apologies to Fearless.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi, and thanks to all who have made this such a great thread! Question... was there a ,"Climbing away," trade today on E/J beginning at 11:00 am NYC time? Just want to see if I get it right. Pippo

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hello Pippo, I believe you got it right! Depending on wether you use 20 or 23.6 your entry time may vary a bit. If one had waited until the 30 reache the overbought you could have picked up as much as 40+ pips.....nice eh? Where was I? Darn!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi moneda, Thanks for your reply and for posting above link. On my chart 15 min turned over at 1:00 pm. A nice trade. Spud left quite a gift to all. Hope he is doing well. Any news of him lately? Pippo

--- 帖子 #457 ---
why the E/U is such volatile at this time ,I cant see any news comming,anybody knows?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I believe it's from "GCC Summit, Day 2". I popped open my Oanda FX News and it has a few flash's with BOF's Noyer comments about inflation and 'no sign of capital shortages at french banks'.

Hi to all, elasticity trade E/J EST 03:15 Sell 161.61. Anyone see this? Pippo

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Re: E/J 03:15 elactic trade. Nearly 30 pips in about an hour, until 15 min. reached oversold.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi Pippo I dont trade EJ but if you are interested I attach example of elasticity trade which I traded a couple of minutes before on A/J,it probably looks similar to your trade. that is nice example of 15/30 crossing50 up to join 4/1H nice below 20 line I exited with +7pips.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Sorry,in this exaple 15M crosse 50 line down and the 30M is below 50 line pointing down as well

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hi marcin, Watchful waiting now.... all TFs oversold on E/J. From this condition two potentials: climbing away with H1,M30,M15 together,and elastic with M15 first leaving and then returning to oversold. Does this sound correct? Pippo

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Guys I have for you small lesson.Although I knew it is not good to enter to early I did today and lost 25 pips,so look at these charts and see how important is to not to enter to early. 1.First chart is when I opened my trade,you can see that 1H/30/15were crossing 80 line together,it looks so nicely ,so attempting to enter so i did it,but the bars were not close yet,and that was big mistake. 2.the position of stochastic change very quickly and 1h stoch.closed above 80 line,so I wouldnt enter if I only waited to the bar close and this would save me from loosing 25pips,I exited at this point. 3.you see ,now all stoch are below 80line and the 1H bar is closed, that is the very right time of entry,look how good it looks,you can feel it is perfect entry, I enetred again at this moment and this trade cover my lost so I break even at the end. So the lesson is: dont enter to early,better to wait until the bars closed and than decide wheter to enter or not.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi Pippo As I said I dont trade this pair but what you said sound correct and could happen but there is plenty of possibilities of movement of stochasticcs,but waiting for this situation you mationed is really worthy to wait ...sorry for my eanglish

--- 帖子 #466 ---
That was an horrendous trade. I did the same as you. Even the H4 stochastic was pointing down and all the rsi's looked right to me. I was so annoyed when it reversed. I had set a stop loss of 30 pips (which I consider to be quite high for this pair and this kind of trade) and by the time I came back from breakfast it had closed. When I re-entered a little later - it was still looking like a good trade - I waited about 30 minutes with nothing much happening. Closed the trade for a loss of about 8 pips. Went to do something else and it moved down another 15 pips. Timing completely wrong! Thank you for your post.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
look at the E/U,long opportunity

i take it .look very promising

O yes,that is impressive move on E?U,cant belice

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Now the price has reached the resistance,it is traendline from 4 H chart,it was kind of breakout move ,the price was ranging since 30 of November. The stochastics definitely detect this move,it is impresive for me,

E/J elastic may be developing. M15 moving nicely.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Pippo and others, Yes, the e/j may gives us that snap back that we all love! I would like to see it go into o/b and then head straight down. I will also wait for a candle close at 7:00am est to see what the other timeframes are doing Good luck

--- 帖子 #475 ---
can anyone attach MTF stoch indicator in the chart

--- 帖子 #476 ---
E/J...M60,M30, and M15(overbought)currently trending up. M240 is currently crossed up, but still oversold. I will take trade at 07:30 if M15 crosses down.

Pippo, The stochs are spread out ... there is a higher probability when they come out of os/ob together..... it can still work but I am just watching

--- 帖子 #479 ---
In changing from one charting technique to another(Heiken Ashi/Standard) I see a,"climbing away," trade had developed at 06:00 EST on E/J. Missed it! Will now continue with standard technique.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Moneda You have right,when 4H is oversold and the other 3 stoch are overbought ,classic diving to trade-short,you cant enter when just 15M cross 80 line,they all suppos to cross 80. I did that mistake today and lost 25 pips because I didnt wait until 1H closed below 80 line and I post the chart on forum so everybody can learn. We should learn from each other. Pippo wait for 3 stoch to cross 80,that is the right way.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
moneda, Do you see the E/J trade at 06:00? Could have been beautiful climbing away followed by, perhaps now developing, elastic. What do you think? Pippo

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Marcin, I share both of your views.... the T/A and the purpose of this great thread.... to help eachother.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Pippo, Yes...it is a beautiful sight... do not forget that what you see after the fact is not what one sees as the stoch is moving back and forth until the candle/bar closes. Let us keep a watchful eye.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Will take the plunge at 07:00 candle close. I am trading very small until I am more confident!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
look at A/J, it looks for me like nice short is coming mayby when 15M bar will close

my elasticity trade onG/J for +8 pips

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Pippo, Patience grasshopper, you know that it is best to let the stoch show you the way... three of them heading down after the o/b cross....yeah! Good luck

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I am glad you took the green pips ,I have chosen G/J there were nice setup on most X/J pair.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Moneda 10 safe pips with no heat and in 2 minutes is great,you are so right-its better to have 10 pips in pocket and regret that it could be more than than regret that you lost 10 or more pips and now we have to protect every single pip we got and wait for next beautiful setup

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hello, Keeping my eye on the e/jpy..... for a diving to trade.... the 4hr shows a downtrend but ranging since yesterday...

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I think you are right to be cautious. I am not sure it's going to happen. H4 stochastics and RSI pointing sharply up. RSI's in other (lower) time frames too high. It will be interesting to see the stochs at the turn of the hour.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I dont like it Moneda,4H is leaving oversold area,1h nothing special. there is no piont to trade against 4H,there will be more better opportunities

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Marcin &amp; Smikester, I agree with your evaluation.. thanks for sharing it!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Attached Image One that's happening right now and looks good. But you will need a shave by the time you get your 20 pips. Sitting near the weekly pivot and support lines. Hmm. Might settle for a couple of pips

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi Smikester, In the chart you posted the M15 stoch never made it to the 76.4% level before turning Is that really Ok with elastic trades? I will re-read Spud! Pippo

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hi Pippopotamus. You are right. I have scanned my notes and I should have waited for it to enter the 76.4 area and exit again. Thanks for pointing that out. I suppose I am lucky that the pair is not moving much at all, so i may wait for it to come back. Could be some time... .

--- 帖子 #501 ---
You can use 50 line as entry point,when 15M cross 50 line and the other stoch are in right place you enter

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hi marcin, I believe 50% line is point at which exit planning begins. Not entry. Stoch must turn from 76.4% or 23.6%. This is how I read Spud's writing on this matter. Please correct me if I read him incorrectly. Pippo

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Well, I promised k2kv I would post a failure: Attached Image Fortunately this is for small lots but I had to move my SL. I am now wondering whether to stay with the trade or bail out...

Possible rubber band set up on GBPJPY daily chart:

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Pippo when trading elasticity it is better when 15M go to overbought/oversold area and than cross 80/20 line to join the other stochastics which are at the other side together,but that happen rarely,more common pattern is that 15M alone or together with 30M is not going so far away from 4H/1H,so your entry point is when it cross 50line to join 1H/4H.If you look at my post you will see many example of mine trading in this way aiming for 5-15 pips. If you read Spud he explain how to get 10 pips a day on g/J trading elasticity So I repeat what he sugested: We trade into the stochastic trend always.The trend is set by the 4Hand the 1H stochastic position.The 4H is above 76.4.The 1H is a bit more fickle depending on your patience.I like it upnear 76.4 and or above 76.4 but nothing wrong if it is rising and above 50 either.this is a feel thing but the higher it is and if it is rising so much the safer you will be.In other words we want 1H to be turning back to the 4 H or up with the 4H.The 30M is our trade signal.Whenever it rises below 50 or below 76.4and crosses either upwards we are in a long trade so long as our 4H and 1H are where they should be.you could easily trade the 15M and use the 1H and 30M or 4H and 1H or even the 4H 1H and 30M to trade "into".This is basically momentu, trading.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
marcin, Thank you for your explanation. I am sure you have made a study of Spud's methods. I must do some re-reading and take some notes. I am glad you are doing well. Pippo

--- 帖子 #507 ---
You must have made a lot of pips to get a name like Pippopotamus!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
An extremely important observation. Thanks, Moneda...

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Marcin, Thanks for sharing this information with us. I have a printout from a sheet of Spud's entitled, "Stochastic Elasticity," which reads a bit differently from what you've quoted. Not much different, but in this particular example, he says that we are only trading the M15. As I've said before, his writing -- though sometimes brilliant -- often seemed slightly ambiguous and contradictory, so you can take this for what it's worth. And I agree that it is very rare indeed for the M15 to end up ob/s before turning around, so I also trade the rubberband wherever it happens to occur, as long as the trend is strong. Just remember that the rubberband setup generally indicates the end of a retracement. The lower TF stoch has fallen away from the longer TF H4 (the trend) due to price retracing away from the momentum of the trend. When price moves back into the trend, the M15 turns around and heads back up to the H4. As a result, I consider it a fairly safe trade. The Bringing Back Sexy trade setup is also based on this retracement principle, and that is why it works so well -- both setups ask you to trade with the trend. The big difference here is that boxingislife (the author) uses shorter, faster-reacting stochs, so there is more action, with perhaps a bit less reliability as a result. I believe that when a retracement occurs, it is generally expected that the deeper it is, the stronger will be the comeback. So if we follow that logic, it stands to reason that when the M15 falls deep into ob/s territory, its return to the trend will be stronger, safer and more profitable than if it just retraces to, say, the 50% level. In the end, you pay your dollar and decide how you alone want to play. Good trading!

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi Marcin. Amazing observations man. I did find that more times than not that in elastic trades the 15 doesn't get to the ob/os for a premium setup. I do have one question though with regards to the 1 hour chart. If we have a chart with the 4hour being in extreme position, but the one hour has shifted drastically away, can you still in your opinion trade elasticity with the 15min being in the proper extreme as well. Sometimes i'm finding that the one hour is showing a totally different picture than the 4 hour extreme. Also, i found it very helpfull that other day you posting which currencies are almost setting up for a trade and which ones you took and not. Thank you so much for sharing what you know with regards to mtf stochastics.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
"I believe that when a retracement occurs, it is generally expected that the deeper it is, the stronger will be the comeback. So if we follow that logic, it stands to reason that when the M15 falls deep into ob/s territory, its return to the trend will be stronger, safer and more profitable than if it just retraces to, say, the 50% leve"- yes ,that is true,simply because 15M have more space to move from 20 to 80 than from 50 to 80 so you can expect you will grab more pips,that is why when trading elasticity whit 15M crosing 50(not 20/80) we should be more picky choosing setups and pay more attention to position of other stochs,4H and 1H should be definitely above 80,below 20 but what I like even more they shoul be much higher then 20/80,i like them somewhere in 85,90 and pointing a litille up or at least very flat,not pointing down,and it would be nice to have 30 above80/below 20 but that for me is not neceasery,when it is below 80 and nicely ,clearly pointing up in the moment of 15M crossing 50 that is ok Pippo: One more time,1H dont need to be above 80 ,it can be just below but must be coming back to 4H at the moment of 15 crossing 20/50 .look at the position 5 with the chart,that is the feel thing. look at my real example and consider position of stochasic 1. 15 croos 20 first chart 2. 15 cross 50 next 3 charts 3. 15/30 cross 50 next 1 chart 4.example of trading into 1H and 30M next 3 chart with 4H has crossed 20 and nicely pointin in direction of trade 5. That is for Pippo ,1H is not above 80 but I would trade it ,feel thing last chart I am not an expert,I am starting to winning in forex so please dont take what I said for extremly sure,I just showing my trades and thoughts,which I thing are right

--- 帖子 #512 ---
..

--- 帖子 #513 ---
And I need to add ,I think trading this way is good and safe for 5-15 pips,sometimes the price go much further than that so it is up to you,you can even wait until 15M cross 80/20 and exit at the moment of 15M crossing back 80/20.I try to exit when having around 10 pips. Spud sugestion ,as I remember , was to target 10 pips but he trade G/J and this is very volatile pair so please keep that in miond

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Morning Marcin. Good examples shown. And I do take your point - not to be greedy - no way to tell if you are in a "perfect" set up with this method. Looking to this morning, high volatility could give us a few good trades.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Now set up on lower timeframes this morning, took entry at 226.90 on break of 1 hour pin bar. Will look to hold part of this position to capitalise on daily set up.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
.... and just over 1 hour later:

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi Charlies. A good trade. A brave trade. But when you took the trade the M30 and H1 were above 80? When you say lower time frames wre you looking at lower than M15? How much did the 1 hour pin bar influence you? Were you also looking at RSI's, eg daily and H4? Sorry for all the questions.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
It would be nice to hear what make you to enter this trade,as Smikester said it wasnt good setup to enter when taking into acount stochastics position.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
marcin, Thanks for your explanations. How do you see Charlies last G/J trade?

I look for the trade to set up on the stochastics (i.e. separation of the stochs), but look for price action to confirm the trade &amp; for entry. Daily stoch had set up as overbought against the weekly, so then looking for a short entry on the lower timeframes. This morning, the hourly down to 15 min were set up as overbought against the 4hr, so I then look for price action to confirm a short trade. The hourly PIN gave a clear entry. It was a little risky as news was due a few minutes later, but with such a clear set up, I decided to take it. The trade is now at +200, but the initial target on the daily chart is at +500 so just have to see if it gets there before being stopped out.

Watching G/J pair. All TFs are OS. Potential from this state is,"climbing away," trade. Let's see. Marcin, what do you think about this?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Thank you Charlies for your explanatipon. Anyway the daily chart was not overbought and the weekly was not oversold and looking at your chart at the moment of entry it was trade against 4H which was not below 20,but crossed it up and was pointing up,additionaly only 15M left overbought area,the 30/1H were still above 80 so it was nothing like good setup for me. I agree that the 1H pin bar was nice and analising price action you could trade it.Personaly I use mainly mtf stoch and according to that it was risky trade. Glad you made pips, thank you.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Pippo yes ,it could happen what you said,but who knows,look at A/J ,mayby in 30 min when 1H close above 50 line it could be posible long entry.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Entered trade 08:00. S/L 25 pips TP 15 pips

--- 帖子 #525 ---
G/U 15M is leaving the other stoch and crossing 50 up,and the other stay well below 20 flat,that is good sign,pity that some news are coming in 15 minutes but you can keep an aye on it.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Pippo Why yoy enter?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
At open 08:00 candle my charts showed M15,M30,H1,H4 all oversold and turning up. All... entered at 224.95 TP 225.1 Sl 224.7... Stopped out... -25! Very small position, but still not happy!

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Only 15M left oversold and the bar was closed ,1H and 30 did not crossed and even if 1H and 30M would cross 20 the bars should be closed. Too early entry are killer,I lost my money trading that way,it is better to miss good opportunity than jump into bad trade and loose money

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Marcin, You are right. I should have waited for crosses of oversold level, and probably after news releases. I should wait for proper signal.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
ok,possibly long on A/u when 4H cross 20 up,possibly short G/J when 15 cross 50 down,but the other stoch should be in right position

--- 帖子 #531 ---
As Charlies said, on GBP/JPY, with weekly, daily and H4 stochs all pointing down, only shorts are favoured for now.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Smikester, Did Spud not trade against daily or weekly. I have not seen this in his writings.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I got + 8 pips on A/U but my entry wasnt very safe as I enter a litille bit before 1H close.I would say dont do that until you have some good feeling of the price movement and with awernase it is more dangerous.I wouldnt enter but when I saw this big engufling bar I did. I could have 16 pips but ened up wit 8 . G/J ...still could be short soon

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Watching close of M15 candle. Will enter short if close is down.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
What a great name, Pippo. I don't remember Spudfyre mentioning higher time frames but I was referring to Charlies post. In any case, Spudfyre has brainwashed me into "H4 is your trend". Sometimes I like to look at higher time frames. Also, the H4 is not clear on your M15 mtf chart. I like to look at it on a different chart, full screen, with no clutter. Good pipping to you. Don't mention my EUR/CHF trade yesterday.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
G/J...Short 224.74 SL 225.01 TP 224.61. Soon to be stopped out again! Out at 9:45 bar close 224.87 -12pips.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Pippo I am in trade as well -10 at the moment

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Marcin, Good luck. Adverse bar close with impending news release. I decided to close trade. Pippo

--- 帖子 #539 ---
the 1H has closed and still look good ,30 the samse,I am stilii in trade

--- 帖子 #540 ---
G/J M15 in OB (77-82 range) H4,H1 still clearly OS, very well below 20. M30 above OS, above 30 with strong upward bias. Looks like potential Elastic trade at M15 bar close, if down, but strong M30 upward bias causes reservations about taking this trade. We'll see...At close of bar I took trade S224.89 SL225.14 TP224.74....Have decided to move SL to 225.16, one tick above previous swing H on M15. Stopped out, and it only took 30 seconds! That's efficient.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I stayed in trade until now ,my exit -10 pips,although my drrawdown was high -55 I didnt exited because 4H and 1h didnt react at all and were all the time flat well below 20 and that confirm me to not to get out of trade,but now the 30 stoch cross 50 up and is against 15M which is pointing up,I am not sure how the situation will develop although the 1H still didnt leave oversold area and elastic tarde 15/30 into 4/1H is still possible but it is not so clear and I dont like to be in trade at this time,is bad time to trade, thanks

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Wow! You are brave. 55 drawdown! I think very long bars skew data and throw off indicators. I am thinking 03:00 to 05:00 today. Look at H4 and H1...maybe too negative, too long. Just now, price dropped about 70 pips G/J beginning at 11.30 until about 12:15. Now looks like retracing. What happened? Because you exit short marcin?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
UJ possibly long entry

--- 帖子 #544 ---
..

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I lost 20 pips although it looked for me not bad to enter,however I considering about 1h bar which was pionting up ut the moment but it was not closed. I do not like UJ,I always loose money trading it,have to wait until I will better know it.Any coments...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hey, I almost took that one myself. It did look right. Perhaps a question over the H1? Onwards and upwards...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Looked like a good set-up to me. Pippo

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Several high impact news releases scheduled today for both London and New York sessions. Any comments?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I don't want to seem a smartass after the event, but did you see the M5 stochs for that failed UJ trade? Maybe could have waited for that to be positioned correctly? I always kick myself when I don't check and a trade starts off badly. Usually, it doesn't matter too much but at the TP levels you are using I would say it is even more important. What do you think of this?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Steer well clear at my level of competence. I am already in a long term trade and intend to leave that alone, but won't be trading mtf lower time frames until 20 to 30 minutes before and after the news to let the dust settle. I have had my fingers burned once or twice. Ouch. It still hurts.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Smikester, You bring up a good point regarding the 5min. I have a 1m/5/15 that I use once I narrow my target to a pair and check the action there for optimal entry. Going with the 4hr trend wether you are climbing or diving to it gives me extra confidence and sometimes keeps me from hitting the panic button.

USDJPY daily chart - possible rubberband set-up

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Charlies. Thank you for that observation. Why is one indicator stepped and the other analogue? I mean, is there any advantage to it? Have you any other analysis to back up this potential trade? I like to look at longer TF mtf stochastics but I am using a modified version of Spudfyres indicator and it does not seem to look right.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Not sure why it is stepped, had the set-up/chart for quite a while &amp; never questioned it. I think it is showing the weekly stoch based on the weekly close, so it is adjusted once each week. Most of the time, I use the hourly chart for entry, I'm still experimenting with finding a set up on the daily &amp; then actively looking for entry on the lower tf. If you look back at the daily stoch, it does a good job of identifying the swings. Watching for entry on the hourly:

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Smikester to be honest,this trade was my fault,I woke up ,saw this setup and jump in without deeper analysis,I didnt check 5m although i normaly do that. It is bad to be to confidence after winning many times. What I think about this trade now is :the setup looked good,but it was nearly one hour to 1H close,so I should wait and see how it develop or wait for 5 min to better tune my entry,but the best idea is just to leave it and wait for clear situation. It seems I start to break my rules and thank you Smikester,analizing bad entrys is what we need to learn and become more disciplined . I would like to add something regarding elasticity trades. We talked about 50 line as a triger to enetr elasticity trade when 15 corss it up or down to join the 4/1h/30m.I still think this kind of trades have high rate of winning when aiming for 10 pips,but in this kind of trades we should pay more attention to very good stochastic position,it should be perfect and normally you gain your 5,10 pips very quickly.I think such trades are good for somebody who has some experience because you cant relay on 15M stoch to heavily. I analyzed my trades and read some Spuds notes one more time and it seems trading elasticity with 30M crossing 50( or 20/80 even better)into 4H and 1H is more reliable .In other words I would say 30M stoch is more reliable signal as 15m stoch."whenever it rises below50 or below 76.4 and crosses either upwards we are in a long trade so long as our 4H and 1H are where they should be". Spud wrote that he use 5/15 to time entries and exits,no point to exiting if the 5/15 are both at the top and headed down in a short position.he dont heavily relay on the 15m moves other than pay close attention to price when 15M goes against us.simply the 30M is not as cyclical as 15M and that is the reason and the 30/1H make pretty reliable tandem. I made already 2 trades with 30 cross 50 into direction of 4H and 1H with succes .In both trades at the moment of 30M crossing 50 line the 15 M was already joining 4/1h and was crossing 80line(it was long trades) and at the moment of exiting 30M was touching 80 line and 15M was leaving oversold area. Please keep an aye on it and post such trades(elasticity with 30 into direction of 4/1H) so we can learn and see what kind of rubber band trades are most reliable)

My trade for +8pips

--- 帖子 #557 ---
my trade +15 enter when 30 cross 80 down i am experimenting so I trade smaller position

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Here's a nice rubberband I took this morning. I generally trade the M15 toward the H4. I entered as the M15 approached the 38 level, as I feel this is stronger confirmation of the move, less chance of a false move at the 23 level. The 30 &amp; 60 were just beginning to hook back up at the time of my entry. Move was good for +25, though I left much sooner on the first retrace (took only +6) due to my losing streak the past two weeks, even though all stochs were headed up at the time. I've been extremely "retrace-shy" this week, but I'm working on that.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
look at this setup on U/j,the 1h is not closed but its nice setup with 4H below 80 line,if you trade it be carefull,thatis not the best time to trade

--- 帖子 #560 ---
My today trade for 10 pips: 15/30M crossed 50 and pointing very strongly up tight together, There was an inside bar on 1H time frame and on the 4H time frame you could see some bars earlier very long lower wicks,one over 90 pips and at the moment outside bar was forming. the move was over 50pips,I got just 10.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I thought that was a well thought through trade and even though it was against the recent trend it was obvious, from your explanation, that the price action supported it.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Jeff, Nice.... I am going to call you "Elastic Man" one of our super heroes! I will not be around until the 17th... Wish you and all of the Spudytes "Happy Pipping"

Hello, I will leave for the week with this trade that I am still in.. Put a 20 Trail Stop and the rest of the story to be told at some later date. It has been a rollercoaster week....drank a bottle of Pepto Bismol!! (just kidding) the education continues....

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Did you notice the "engulfing candle" at the start of the move in your UJ trade? I think you must have. I have been reading up on price action and this is the sort of thing I'm looking for all the time now. It seems also that marcin has similar thoughts.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Yes Smikester I look for candlestick formation as they show emotions and are good confirmation.the one you reffer to is not realy outside bar,anyway I think 15M time frame is to low to relay on candlestick paterns,1H and higher woulod be better to analise. I would like to so much to read Nison's book Candlestick Course but cant get it here in Poland and even shops from Uk or USA dont deliver here,mayby you know how can I get it. Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi Smikester, Yes, in fact, I did. I probably should have mentioned it, but I am trying to focus on MTF Stochs, and don't want to confuse or complicate things for anyone just coming in. As far as time frames and candlestick patterns are concerned, Steve Nisson says that they are good on all time frames and I believe him. That was definitely a classic engulfing pattern (good spotting!) which gave me an extra bit of confidence, but it did not signal the trade for me. Take care all, have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hello, Okay, I reconsidered my position and decided that I needed the positive pips at hand more than the potential for greater rewards....good for the soul. Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi there, Im new to stochs being a breakout trader myself,and look forward to being involved with this trading method with you hopefully, just looking for something to add on, have read a good deal of spudfyre,s material (which took a while) which is v. good got a bit lost with all the updates but ive come to the conclusion that his first set of rules, and the escalator methods arent far short of the mark, did he ever publish the final pdf? One thing i wouldnt mind help with initially is how to put the multiple t/f stochs in one window, Im on mt4,do you use the "stochv2 mq4" and its template, along with spudfyres instructions or is there another way, many thanks in anticipation , Francis

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi Francis, Welcome to our discussion! Spud never did publish his final PDF; he just suddenly disappeared from the scene, leaving only his legacy! The Spudfyre thread is rather long and many, many changes and indicators now make up the bulk of current discussions on that board; that's the main reason I decided to open up this thread -- so we can focus more specifically on his methods . I use the stochastic indicator #MTF_Multi_Stochastic . I've included it below along with a template that should get you started. Please feel free to ask questions and post charts of your trades, both good and bad. Best of luck!

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Marcin, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for your many contributions to our thread. I know how much time it takes to post charts and explain the details of your trade, and I want to assure you that we appreciate your efforts (as well as the efforts of all of our contributors!). After following your trades for awhile, it looks like you're doing really well. I wonder if you're trading on a demo account or trading for real? I like your approach of taking conservative pips; I tend to do the same, though I expect once I have more experience I will feel more inclined to stay longer. Good trading, and have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #571 ---
hi Jeff than you for this words...and I try to post the charts at the moment of my entry because that is what matter so everybody can see how it looks like at this specific moment,you know that spoting good trades later ,when it is finishd is really simple,but it is not to spot it when it begins. yes,I am playing with real money,my account now is a litile over 5000USD and I try to risk 2% of my account,so 1Pip for me is somewhere about 2-5 USD.As you said my approach is now rather conservative as I am still learning.My plan is to grow my account and get more experience and than trade bigger position size and stay in trade longer. what I see now after trading many pairs that is better to stay with 2-3 pairs and get familliar with them than looking at many pairs,because every pair has its specification so it is good to know very goog them. thank you .

great thread! I have been working on a daily system, but this MTF stochs seems powerful enough to warrant my waking up a a few hours early to catch the london session for some short term trading.. I am pretty excited about getting started on this tomorrow night. I really like the idea of trading when all stochs are going in same direction (best case might be with 15 coming up from overbought/sold..

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I am really amazed - looking at the 15M GJ chart. pretty incredible trade results with rubber band and agreement trades.. i have just blocked the candles on my chart and followed the stochs. when i see a good trade, i uncover the candles and see how i would have done. not a loser yet, and lots with 100ish pips. all on GJ

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi Nate, Welcome aboard! I wish you the best of luck with MTF Stochastics. Please feel free to share your results and ideas with us. Good trading...

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hi Nate, As you may know, stochs are lagging indicators. They follow price. When price moves, so do the stochastics, especially the shorter ones. So, when you look back on the charts it is easy to see that price has moved in accordance with the stochs. Every significant price move will be copied by the stochs. However, when you are in the chart in real time -- going forward -- there are times when the stochs begin to signal a trade opportunity, but price reverses, proving the signal false. Stochastic indicators change just like candles do, during the formation of those candles. So, here's some quick advice: Just be aware that the charts and stochs may not appear quite the same looking back as they did looking forward, since all the good moves are confirmed by the stochs, but the false starts and moves to the reverse may have originally looked like they were heading in the right direction before they were redrawn on the screen. You might want to study your monitors for a little while to see how the chart action redraws while price is moving about, before placing your chips on the table. Have fun, and good luck!

--- 帖子 #578 ---
anyone any idea why multi stoch indicators are making meta freeze I can load onto all charts ok, apart from but GBP/JPY then everything just locks up, have tried deleting and reloading various but to no avail , advice gratefully received thanks, Francis

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Market is closed now, no data feeds!

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Thanks Jeff. I had forgotten about that with the stochs, though i have observed it myself with them being redrawn. it seems like if you are looking for a rubber band, you should be safe if you have both 30 and 15 together and for agreement trades, when you have hourly, you are in good shape.. as you said, ill have to see it in practice. The only tough part of this system is obviously that you need to be at the PC to catch it.. i am planning to demo trades off of it this week. maybe we can consider a signal thread with everyone who uses the system so if someone sees a really good setup, they can post it and alert others using the system. then you subscribe the thread to your cell phone, so if a really good signal comes while you are sleeping, you get it, etc..

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Yep I can get it for you. Even a Polish translation available. Check your pm. Regards...

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi natejax, welcome. I'm sure you are going to have lots of success if you study this method carefully. When I started I did just what you have described and it creates a very exciting anticipation. You probably already know this but I am going to say it anyway. The path the stochastics leave is very different from the one they make in real time. So go in carefully with lots of money management till you get the feel of it. Wait. and wait again, for the high probability trades. Even then, take care. I tend to trade like a bull in a china shop so I know. Hope you don't mind me saying the above. And I just realised k2kv said something similar

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Sorry for being inactive in this forum, I am now compiling my strict trading rules, so that I will only trade high probability trades. I am having very great success with MTF stochs, but now I am becoming more careful. I don't want to let this success turn to failure. THE GOLDEN RULE: WAIT! WAIT! WAIT Don't rush!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi natejax, I second him. Do not rush to any trades. Try to start from basics. Only follow setups that are very basic. Like the elastic trades, agreement trades.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Kris, i noticed from your blog that you are really tearing it up. Will you share your rules with us when they are finished? What hours do you do your trading?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Thanks for the tip. At one point does a particular stoch segment finalize? After its corresponding candle is closed?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Yes, but even then can reverse. Have an eye on the higher timeframes. I like to keep an eye on RSI and EMA's in higher time frames for trends and when the price is consolidating - some or all ema's are converging and it's definitely worth waiting. Stochastics alone will not tell you this very well and you might be wondering why you're in a good set up which is not moving. Another piece of advice I would give which I know to be true is this: Keep the chart as big as possible, also your indicator. Not to be cluttered up with account information and superfluous indicators. Then keep your chart settings the same, bearing in mind MT4 will squash your view in default setting to fit all the price action on the screen, it's worth experimenting with scale fix so that you can see volatility better. You probably already are looking at ATR for SL settings and TP. Other people on here? What do you think about the above? Please add your comments/criticisms

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi smikester, I agree. Your advice is always good, always appreciated. The perceived action can vary widely depending upon how you set up your charts for viewing, so it's definitely worth experimenting. Hope you have a good week!

--- 帖子 #589 ---
It seems, logically, that the best trades will have the 4 hour indicator already headed in direction of the trade when the shorter ones line up. you would want to avoid the shorter ones leading the way.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi Nate, This is quite true. In general, you want to trade with the longer trend (as indicated by the H4). Just for fun: The classic "away" trades are entered in a direction away from the longer trend but, to reduce the risk of a turnaround, you can view your H4 stochastic on a 4-hour timeframe chart (rather than on a 15-min chart as when you view all four stochs together), thereby revealing the true character and direction of your H4 stoch. Wait for the H4 to begin turning toward the opposite side as this will indicate a likely new trend direction.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Fantastic trading Kris. I make it a point to read your blog everyday, it is great to see a person being successful. I wanted you to clarify something for me, your initial charts were all 5M, but your last chart is 15M. Have you changed time frames? Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
just went through all my pairs and don't see any immediate or likely near-term setups. will check back in a couple hours. if any of you guys are watching, please post anything you see for discussion/analysis.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
If I may, your response to whether or not a stochactic segment(bar,candlestick,however a TF is represented),"finalizes," is a bit confusing. On the one hand you say,"yes,"(it does finalize). Then you go on to say,"but even then it can still reverse." If it is ,"finalized," and then reverses, that means that it wasn't,"finalized," dosen't It?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
it could be nice long soon on GU,look at the 1H stoch,at the same time 1H is pointing up strongly and 15/30m are pointing down ,that means for me that when 15/30 tourn up it could be strong move

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi Pippo. You are quite right. To be clear I should have said the stochastic segment traced on the chart finalises at the end of the candle. But that does not mean it is not possible for the stochastic chart (and the price) to set off (from there) in the opposite direction when the next candle opens. Thank you for clearing up that vagueness.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
I think the breakout on G/U is comming,if you go to 1H chart and draw trendlines you can see that,Stochastics can show it as aelasticity trade,I already took 10 pips on G/u.I still prefer the price going north,what do you think guys

--- 帖子 #597 ---
I think the question is already answered

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I managed to take 11.3 pips on it.It is amazing how stochastic show it if you watch it carefully,the stochastic show this move is coming in advance,that is fascinating 1 enter 2 exit

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I think G/u is have now room to go north much more,but I am ok with my over 20 pips already

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I took a UJ short trade. it is an agrement trade. it is not ideal, as 4 hour is still overbought, but it is headed downward. The other 3 are all very close together and moving down well above oversold.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I am going to close it out. not really following the rules with 4 hour overbought. and does not seem to be going the right way. luckily it is just demo. better just to wait for the right setups. looks like i missed the good setups while i was sleeping (GU).

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Natejax I dont want to say U/J is tricky to trade with Mtf stoch,but my most lost I took on this pair so I just dont trade it anymore.Mayby it was my fault but it was pair which generated for me looses.So I just say be carefull.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
E/J currently OB on H4,H2,H1,M30,M15. Maybe trading away trade at 07:00 ET if H1,M30,and M15 have turned down. Pippo

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Thanks Marcin. Yeah, it definitely was not the MTF stochs failing, but me, as the 4H was still overbought and so, under Spuds rules for agreement, it would not be a trade. I can see the hardest part of this system will be to wait for the right trades and not jump on things that almost look right. Especially when I wake myself up at the crack of dawn, i have a vested interest in taking a trade.. Obviously discipline will be the key to success with this system, as with any other.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
E/J H4,H2,H1 OB. M30,M15 still OB, but now with downward bias.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
USDCAD could be setting up for a nice elastic/agreement within the next couple hours. Only thing i don't like is the possible bull pennant. and then the 4 hour looks like it might want to pick up. what do you guys think?

wait for 15 to close,if above 50 I enter

--- 帖子 #610 ---
the only thing about GJ is that the 30 is still up. does that matter? EDit. looks like it is shaping up to have been a nice trade. nevermind.. i had it in my head to only take elastics when you had the divergence with both 15/30. but it looks like just 15 will work also.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hello Natejax, I think in order for this to be a good setup, you will clearly need for all 3 stochs to come down from overbought, preferable together. It looks like H4 may be coming up from oversold, so you might see mixed signals on this one. I have pivot at 68 so be wary around that number 68 to 72 and that was where resistance was during asian session. Now that it's broken thu, may see support around that level. As you say, this one needs a little time to see what it will do. Cheers, CanuckCT

UJ looks good (UJ prejudice notwithstanding)

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hello Pippo, Have a look at AUDJPY for the same time....it moves a lot better with the stochs than EURJPY. There was an easy 10 pips here and with just a bit of nerve a 40-50 pip move. I caught 10. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Thanks for the advice. I will take a look. Pippo

--- 帖子 #615 ---
UJ was really not looking so hot. I am going to make sure i check the 4 hour stoch in the larger timeframe chart. The slope looks a lot flatter than it actually is when it is zoomed in like that.

EJ looks good long + swap

--- 帖子 #620 ---
those stochs seem to change their mind every time i jump in... still, probably worst time for trading right now.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hi,I believe you must wait for bar/candle to be closed before making a trade. And yes, this is probably not a very good time of the day to be trading. Pippo

--- 帖子 #622 ---
EJ came through after all. Got out with 20 pips.. that was my first successful MTF stochs trade and it was far from ideal. felt good, nonetheless. now i just have to practice...

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Not much happening yet.. I will probably hit the gym in a half hour and with some luck won't miss much. Looks like really good setups might be at least an hour+ away. but sometimes they sneak up on you

--- 帖子 #624 ---
my today trade for 9 pips

--- 帖子 #625 ---
very nice.. i stayed out of that because the 60 was pointed down. i guess you get a better sense of when you can take the stochs on balance as you use them more.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Natejax Look at first chart ,the 1H is definitely above 80 and pointed up and the 4H is very high at 95 level. Normaly I take trades when 15/30 cross 50 but because of ideal position of 4/1H I jumped in for 10 pips,even though 15M didnt cross 50. What I think about trading elasticity 15/30 into 4/1H is to observe carefuly 4/1H.If they are high, well above 80 and pointing up that is fantastic.watch them how they react at the time 15/30 is moving down.If they still manage to stay flat or even be pointed up that make me sure the upcoming upwards move is more reliable and stronger. Look at my post 594 and read this page to the end,you will see what I am talking about- the stochastic told me in advance that the move up is comming,look at the charts.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
yeah, i just saw that. i don't know why, but on mine it was pointed downward.. i might have to see if i did not have the time period mixed up when i thought you had taken the trade.

Frankly, this has been the slowest, most painful three hours I've ever experienced in the morning. Too little volume, too much drift -- for me.

But it was busier earlier at the London open. Sparks may fly later, in about 6+ hours, when we have the USD interest rate decision.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
what do you guys think about AJ? hourly is turning back, 4 hour is overbought but sloped downward.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Good morning, Here's a nice little elasticity trade I took this morning. I was just about to fall asleep at the computer when this pair began to move. All stochs were headed up, led by the M15 to meet the H4. Was good for 15 or so but I only took 8, as I had to leave. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Nate, This was another good rubberband trade. I could have taken this instead of the audusd, but the spread was less than half, so it was an easy decision.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
just took over 100 pips profit on GJ.. not a true agreement trade, but all stochs had been pointing down (was still overbought though).. but i saw the price action and decided to jump on it. im going to focus on my real job for a bit now and tune back in as it gets closer to fed.. good luck guys.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
what do you guys think about shorting on A/U now,the 1H could be better

I already exited +8.8 pips

--- 帖子 #644 ---
My today trade for +7pips I was trading together with 4H stoch and 1H stoch which ponted down,the 30M was flat at the moment of entry but because 15M went all the way to overbought and crossed 80 down I was quite sure of grabing 5-10 pips.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Here is what I would consider to be a classic failed trade taken today: Attached Image Instead of entering a couple of bars earlier when the M15 had just touched and then left the 76 line I waited for the 30 and 60 stochs to confirm, which they did. It was not a very clever trade, as you can see. The strong support around 164.00 shows up everwhere: Attached Image The trade went into profit briefly and then left the area, with a couple of teasers on the way. Not helped by the news release at 1.30GMT (8.30 EST) the EJ changed direction for good and I had an opportunity to recoup my losses. Lessons learned: Just because the H4 stochastic is in the right position does not mean your trade is guaranteed. Look at where the price has been for the last couple of hours, especially where it has formed lows (support) or highs (resistance)and not just daily S and R. Enter the trade at the right moment, eg when the M5 has just turned the corner and supports you direction. Learn about price action. Those hourly candles were shouting. Be lucky, like me, learning from mistakes like this with micro lots, or a demo account. If you miss the last train, there will always be another one in the morning.

Hi Guys, Although I had decided earlier this week to put the BoxingisLife Sexy Stochastics aside for this week, after sitting around for more than three hours this morning without seeing one good clear setup, I became really itchy for something , so I decided to take this one. This setup: 25,10,10 overbought in M5, strong uptrend confirmed on M15 chart (not attached). 5,3,3 on the M5 crosses its signal up after hitting bottom, enter long. Exited with +8 as it slid back from +13.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
smikester, It looks to me like your stochs were not in any standard position to trade, so your trade very risky to begin with. It wasn't an "away trade" since the 15 was descending by itself, and it wasn't an elasticity trade since the H4 was not in oversold. What do you mean when you say, "I waited for the 30 and 60 stochs to confirm?" Would you mind describing the exact rules that got you into this trade? Unless I'm missing something here (always quite possible), I don't understand your entry. Might help us both. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hi all, Here's a trade I took this morning on audjpy (fast becoming a favorite pair): Entered 1046 EST at .9779 (including spread), exited +13. I took this trade based on the 15 coming out of the hole (crossing up past 23.6), with the M30 right behind it and the H1 following the M30, like three little soldiers. H4 was headed straight down, but is a slow follower so, unless I'm using the H4 as an ob/s anchor for a rubberband, I will often ignore it. Hope everyone has a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Just took this trade, a boxingislife sexy is back setup (also known here as "sexy"). Strong downtrend as indicated on the M5 by blue 25-10-10. Trend confirmed on M30 &amp; M60 as well (very important to have MTF chart confirmation!). Entered short at end of retrace as indicated by 5,3,3 crossing its signal down. Retrace was nice and deep into overbought, all the way to the top of the chart, indicating a strong resumption of the trend would likely follow (it did). I exited with only +5 when price stalled at late hour of the morning (chicken little would have done the same). As I post this, price is still moving down, now +24. One day I hope to build enough confidence to stay in for many more more +pips!

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Yes, believe it or not, the H1 and M30 were pointing downwards at the time the trade was opened. But you are right, it doesn't meet any proper rules. Very risky is putting it politely...

--- 帖子 #651 ---
AJ is looking like the 15 is going to join the others,so watch it for possibly short entry

HI Jeff I would like to refer to your first chart with A/J ,this is a nice stochastic setup althhough the trade was against 4H,but you was aware of that and I just want to say to less experienced traders that trdaing against 4H is more risky as you trade against trend and is better to no to trade at all such setups.the trend can safe us when we get in trouble.For me that is very important rule"do not trade against 4H stoch."there is so many good stochastics setups that we can be picky and concentrate on the best ones.Keep that in mind and be the winner

wow, this chat room will be a great for my trade Thank's k2kv. No one was there GMT 2.15, ok, I'll wait. Any way, does any body see a bull trend on GJ this week begin ? DC

--- 帖子 #657 ---
there is good setup on GJ pair almost every day I'm using mtf stoch 533 TF(15,30,60,240) to define trend EMA4hi,lo +TF M5 for entry price here is one set up I long at 228.07(see green up arrow) and closed 228.57, (H1 is OB)

--- 帖子 #658 ---
This is another set up, for entry choose between break EMA4 hi or stoch M5 cross 50, or you can use it both. This step will guarantee to have a very small draw down. even very small draw down for GJ, I still have to use sl 30 pips

--- 帖子 #659 ---
My today trade for +11pips. this is example of "Climbing away trade long": 1H,15/30M nicely lined up and strongly pointing up together,1H and 30 M are very tight together. My target was pivot line but I exited a litile bit before price test it,it was very quick and no heat green pips.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
As trading away from 4H remember we should not chase for big pips gain as we trade away from 4H.Keep that in mind. I prefer to trade into 4H as it is more safely to stay with overall trend.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
looks good Musanto. Can you post the other indicators that your template uses?

my today trade for 10 pips It is a clear setup with 15 joining the other below 20 line. what make this trade quite safe was very good position of 4H and 1H very low ,below 10 and 30M at 10 .All stochastic was flat or pointing down and the moment of 15M crossing 50 line was entry signal.I didnt even wait for 1H to close as setup was very good. the move is now for more than 50 pips down,I am happy with my 10

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Good morning, Here's a trade I took this morning on the AUDUSD. This is my favorite kind of trade, a small rubber band I like to call "The 1560." I trade the M15 to the H1, and I don't think I've had a loser yet. As long as the H1 is below 38.2, and the M15 begins its run down from above 61.8, I'll trade the M15 down to meet the H1. Hardly matters where the other stochs are. I often wait for the M15 to cross the 50 down, as this makes it a very low risk trade. While it doesn't always make it all the way down, I like it for quick action and smaller pips. You can trade the M5 instead of the M15, same rules, then follow with the M15. Reverse for long. I exited +14, leaving more on the table.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
wow that nice marcin you are good can anyone make it clear how many signal that you know in MTF stoch? when i compare between marcin and k2kv chart it look different signal

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Interesting trading Jeff,I am talking about your 15/60.I will keep an aye on it. That is my today trade for 9 pips. the move doen is now about 25 but as always I prefer quicker and safer pips. Although the 1H bar was not close it was 15 minutes to its close,the 4 h was perfect for elaticity trade ,below 10 and pointing down and the 15m just crossed 50 line. My only worry was 1H which supposed to be lower and closed at the moment of entry but the other stoch. position was nice and daily stoch.was at my favour as well,but remember is much safer to wait for 1H to be closed.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Adikabas tha main trades are: 1.classic trade with the direction of 4 H(escalator ) 2.Diving to trade 3.Diving away trade 4.Climbing to trade 5.Climbing away trade 6. elasticity trade. Spud explained everything in details. We are looking for this main setups but of course you can trade variation of these if you get experience and good grasp of it.

Very nice trading, Marcin. You've become quite an inspiration! Happy holidays!

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Good Morning All, Here's a quick trade I took this morning on GBPJPY, using Boxingislife's Bringin' Back Sexy method. This is a somewhat modified version of the original setup, using just a 25-10-10 (blue) to indicate the trend. The 5-3-3 crosses it's signal back up after the retrace, and I'm in. If you use this setup, make sure you have a strong trend on at least two time frames, and then trade the 5-3-3 on the shortest time frame. Exited with a quick +10 pips

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hey Jeff, Nice trade Jeff. I personally don't like trading M5 but I do use that chart and setup to identify whether price movement is a retrace or a reversal. As your chart indicates, by the fact the the 25-10-10 stoch stayed overbought on M5, there are several retraces in play here. If you were trading a longer term time frame (M30 or H1), the M5 chart here would tell you that the move was a retrace and that you should stay with your position. BTW, nice to see you trading GJ. Happy Holidays everyone!! Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hi Canuck, You've made a very astute observation! In fact, the trend did reverse not long afterward, and this was clearly indicated by the fall of the 25-10-10 below the 80 level. Hope you have a great holiday!

--- 帖子 #675 ---
ive had to give up the early hours because i was losing ability to do a decent job at work.. unfortunately, i have been missing all the good setups. there was a nice setup on AU that i took around 3.. of course, the market barely moves at this time and day and i will probably lose the spread.. i knew better, but took it anyway because i never get to see good setups except when i read the board...

Hi Nate, I suffer the same problem regarding time. I'm on the east coast, and I've tried to shift my awake times, but my personal obligations and bio-clock just won't let me continue that as a lifestyle. I was over-trading, too, most likely to compensate for my limited 9am-12pm trading period. At 9am when I first arrive at my computer, it is normal to see that many big moves have already occurred. I've learned to ignore that, and to not take to heart the numerous messages and postings I see from other traders who may have enjoyed big gains overnight. I never get any of that, and it used to upset me (because, after all, who wants to be left out of all the winning action), but I've since come to grips with the understanding that those moves are simply not available to me, not within my realm. But I think I've figured out how to make the most of my trading time. Basically, I am watching the more volatile pairs, in particular the GBPJPY, since its moves are generally larger than most of the others, and this particular pair tends to follow MTF Stochastic signals quite well. In addition, I am trying to take ONLY the very best setups. The combination of good setups and fast-moving stochastic-friendly price affords the opportunity to take just one or two trades per day, and still come ahead by 20 or 30 pips or more before heading out for lunch. If I remain disciplined in this way, I should do very well in the long term. Time will tell. Also, whenever I have the time, I try to trade the early Asian session which is often quite active before midnight here in NY. Again, I will only trade what I consider to be perfect or "near-perfect" setups, and only trade when I find the market active, so as not to waste valuable pips and valuable time. I've realized that it is more important to feel really good about whatever it is you are able to do, rather than to feel badly about the things over which you have no control. Hope that helps. Have a great holiday!

I've been following this forum for a while and have been trading the "elevator" system of Spud's for the last few months with varying degrees of success. I'm glad you guys are still using the system and posting your trades - it's very helpful. k2kv, I notice you're using that all-in-one stoch indicator, do you wait for the candles to close on the higher timeframes before entering trades? I recently switched to that indicator (as opposed to having four separate charts open) as it's made both backtesting and trading multiple pairs a lot easier. Unfortunately though you can't easily backtest setups where the 1 and 4 hour candles haven't closed yet which is the situation you're going to come across in live trading. Have you guys deviated from the original rules at all? For example, I read one person on the original thread ignores the 4-hour completely. I live on the west coast and work during the day so I can usually trade most of the asian session (though I usually miss the first hour or two) and the beginning of the london session. I'll try to post some setups and trades from these sessions if you guys would like.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Glenn, Thanks for sharing your chart. Please feel free to discuss your method - we are still in the realm of MTF Stochastics. I'm a big fan of Spud's Thread Theory and anything that might enhance its success would be welcomed.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
that is my today trade for 10 pips. I was trading 1H/30/15M being below 80 and nicely pointing down. 4h was above 80 but it gave direction confirmation. quick and no heat trade. When trading only 1H/30/15M I try to not to trade against daily stochastic.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Nice trade Marcin, do you wait for the stochastics to close below 80 before taking a short trade? It looks like on your chart the 15 and 30 had, but not the 1 hour.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Yes Ocelot,the stochastic have to be closed below 80 line. If you take a closer look at first chart you will see the 1H stoch has crossed 80 line and was closed at the moment of entry

--- 帖子 #684 ---
as you see by the two charts, the trade is confirned as the stoch becomes solid and it pass'es the 76.4% level, I only trade when the blue stoch's are on the left ( both long and short). I find using the fib levels to be a good filter. Glenn

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Ah, so it is. I see it now. So do you ignore the 4h stoch then and just trade the 15, 30 and 1 hour? Are you following spud's original rules and riding the stochs down to the 20 or are you going for a set number of pips? And if you don't mind one more question, what are you setting your stop loss at? I've just been using recent areas of support of resistance for my stops, but it often creates a bad risk:reward ratio, something I don't particularly like doing but can work out if you have more winners than losers. Thanks for answering my questions!

--- 帖子 #686 ---
my today trade for 11 pips. Again it was 1H /30/15M agreement trade with 4H above 80 giving direction confirmation(it was pointing down) the move is now over 5o pips and the 4H lefft ovrbought area. what is more what I payed attention at the moment of entry was daily stochs.It was below 20 line.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi Ocelot, Thanks for joining us! No, I don't usually wait for longer TF candles to close, as that would severely limit my ability to trade at the most opportune moments. I much prefer to trade on price action when the stochs are indicating agreement. Forex moves so fast, that waiting for longer TF candles to close is - for me - like waiting for my train to pass before I get on. And, I don't backtest, so that's not really an issue for me. In the main, I'd say this group generally follows the original rules, but once in awhile we might stumble across some variation that seems to be working for us, so we'll share it. Regarding the H4, it is very slow to come around to the direction of the other stochs. After all, it takes four H1 periods or sixteen M15 periods to cause a significant change in its direction. H4 follows the others, and is a good indication of the longer trend, but the more experienced MTFS traders may have a better eye for what is happening overall, and may choose to ignore the H4 if they feel a strong move has been indicated by the other stochs. Spud's "away" trade is a good example of trading against the H4 stoch. And, despite my own reluctance to trade against the trend, I've seen that type of trade end in profit over and over again. Good trading!

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Rialto, Can you please tell me to which posting you are referring? I can't seem to locate any post from Glenn that is previous to yours. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #689 ---
nice explanation Jeff I only add what Spud sugested to do: if you trade only 1H/30/15M do not trade against daily stochastic and if 4H is between 20/80 do not trade against 4H. It is simple so if you want consistent profit follow this rules. Have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hi Marcin, You continue to trade so well! I've decided to stay out of the game until after the New Year, since volume seems light and somewhat erratic. No doubt, I can use the break. Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi Marcin, Yes, some very good pointers. I always watch the daily/longterm trend and will rarely trade against it (in a trending market), no matter how strong the stochastics may be indicating a trade in the opposite direction. Why subject myself to greater risk? Take care, have a safe and happy New Year...

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Jeff, It's funny you ask. I searched last night and couldn't find a trace of Glenn's original post with chart. Strange, maybe it was deleted for some reason. I hope that he posts again on your thread because I'd like to know his take on Spud's Thread theory. Have a Happy and Prosperous New Year.

heres some serious mtf stoch trading 1h chart 4h stoch 21 10 10 and 5/3/3 21 dropping big time the 5 is under 20 = downtrend the lowest window 1h 21 10 10 and 5/3/3 21 under 20 5 pulled back i entered at the red line too bad i got out at 50 pips though but yep thats how i trade any questions feel free guys

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I have reposted my chart's.... I did delete the first ones as I was concerened that my method was not in keeping with the thread. I have been trading the MFT shoch indicator for many years along with MA crosses and channel's/bands. Every now again I update or reread some of the many books etc I have , as you are aware stoch and ma crosses have been traded for many years and people just refine or change things to suite themselves. The setup I have posted makes many postive pips a week, and I find it almost idiot proof ( thats why I trade it).....I only use it on 1hr tf's.....all other trades are done with Elliot waves on a longer TF.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi Glenn, Thanks for posting your charts and setups. I wonder if you would be so kind as to elaborate on exactly what it is you're doing here. Looks pretty complicated to me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one here who would love to learn a new, "idiot proof" method, as long as it involves the application of MTF Stochastics. Perhaps if you posted your rules and explained what constitutes a good setup and entry signal, it might be easier for us to become involved. Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Hi Boxing, Long time, no hear -- I was getting worried about you! I see you've developed a new setup. Looks very interesting. I just want to clarify for those unfamiliar with your methods: Each stoch mentioned also includes the signal line, something we don't usually use with Spud's methods. So, for example, the H4 is the thick cyan line, and the gold is the signal line. Correct me if I am wrong. Would you use this setup only on the H1 chart? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Inserted Code k2kvHi Glenn, Thanks for posting your charts and setups. I wonder if you would be so kind as to elaborate on exactly what it is you're doing here. Looks pretty complicated to me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one here who would love to learn a new, "idiot proof" method, as long as it involves the application of MTF Stochastics. Perhaps if you posted your rules and explained what constitutes a good setup and entry signal, it might be easier for us to become involved. Thanks so much! hi. To me my method is very simple, I find it intresting you say its complicated. If you refer to my post 684 you will see I show the entry points with the MA cross to confirm...as far as a setup goes we look for the pair to turn at the top of the stoch range again confirmed by the bands and when it pases the fib level as showen on the chart thats the entry...of course a long move is reverse. As I have said I have been trading for many years and I belive I have refind it to a stage now where it gives very good returns.... Glenn

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I haven't posted in a while but would like to share what I'm currently doing to perhaps generate some discussion. Last night took 2 trades during the asian session...the blue section on my H1 chart. The first trade was a couple of hours into the asian session...the H4 and daily charts were forming a bearish pattern...H4 5-3-3 stoch clearly moving down and there was a hint that the 5-3-3 on the daily might start to crossover. On the H1 chart, the M30 stoch (blue) went above 80 and turned back down but H4 and H1 did not follow up, and the sexy stoch setup was a good sell setup. Sold at 226.69 and target was S1 or 226.25. Exited for +36 with no heat and thought I might be done for the day. Looked quite bearish so I waited. A bit later hourly bar closed below S1 and I entered a second short trade at 225.90 (waited for price to go below 226) with target of S2 of 225.42, set the target and stop just above S1 and went to sleep. On this entry stochs were close to oversold or already oversold, but because I'm focusing on higher timeframes, I'm not so worried about what price will do when it hits 80 or 20 on the stoch and more focused on S&amp;R and pivots for exits. This trade Closed at 225.42 while I was sleeping. Today would have been another easy short from S2 to S3 but did not trade during the day. Here is what I would have done based on my current strategy...looking at H1 chart - hourly bar closed below S1...looking for price to move below 225 ...target would have been 224.33 for very little heat and + 50 to +70 move. I'm currently focusing on GJ, looking at closed H1 bars for confirmation of direction of trade (sometimes M30), H4 and daily for trend and M5 to time the entry for minimum heat. Stochastics on each with a lot of focus on 5-3-3 on daily, H4 and H1 (you might refer to TEB2 system that uses 5-3-3 and multiple time frames), and I'm using spud without the M15 stoch and finally a view of spud's stochastics theads. I'll probably remove threads from M5 as not using it there. It's a combination of different stoch systems to give me view of bigger picture and less focus on faster moving M5 and M15 timeframes. And I have this snake force thing that I quite honestly don't know what it measures...but is does help me pull the trigger. The other thing I've been working with is stochastic momentum indicator, but it's not on these charts. It works like stochastic, but a bit smoother. My trade target is 30 to 50 pips per trade and I'm thinking there are a couple of times per session where this is possible with GJ. Cheers, CanuckCT

Hi everyone, I thought I'd toss my hat in and post my latest trades. I was watching the chart waiting for an MTF setup when I saw a cluster of doji candles form (just a few candles to the left of the red vertical line) these came at the end of a down trend so I entered a long trade on the close of the first bullish candle. This was a great trade and I took 48 pips profit. My stop loss was below the recent lows and my profit target was the nearest 'double zero' level, 226.00. I don't consider this a proper MTF trade per se because the hourly candle stoch hadn't closed above 20 yet. Which brings me to my next trade -- As soon as the hourly stoch *did* close above the 20 I took another long trade, this is right on the red vertical line. I don't consider this a good trade because by then the 15 min stoch had started turning down. I took the trade anyway and set a profit target of just 10 pips with a pretty tight stop (below the low of the candle immediately prior to the red line). Too tight in this case as I got stopped out on the next candle, the profit target was eventually hit though. After reading Jeff's reply to my last post I'm going to be a little more loose in terms of waiting for candles to close and incorporate more price action into my decisions. It really is more art then science and with a system like this I think it helps to think of it more as a framework that is flexible than a set of hard rules. More trades as I take them!

hey k2 this isnt a new method this is how i trade most of the time. the only thing i did is merge the 1h and 4h into 1 chart im always trading mtf and for the past year i have not taken any trade unless i checked a higher timeframe with it anyways ill post more later but i wanted to show u how during a trendy 4h stoch, even if u dont have a signal there and just direction, u can alway go down to 1h and trade the pullbacks there.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi Ocelot, Thanks for posting your trades! It really helps everyone, whether good or bad. Your first trade was a great trade, and well thought out. In addition to the Doji pair, you also had agreement from three stochs, all climbing up. Nice. As you mentioned, the second trade had the M15 turning back down against you. To add insult, the H4 was heading into oversold and the M30 had already gone flat. So, basically, you only had the H1 in your favor. Definitely not a good setup. Thanks again for sharing!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Hi Glenn, I've taken a closer look, and you're right -- it's not so very complicated. I need to learn more about the stochastic threads and what they indicate. I do understand MA crosses and fibs, though, and I like how you've put it all together. Would you be able to post your template so I can explore it further this week? Thanks very much!

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Sure I will do that later in the week, however from reading spuds thread I belive I trade the stoch thread/rope as he does...wait untill it becomes a solid mass then when it pass's the fib level it has the momentum behind it.I have just added the other filter's and TP levels so its a total method..

Hi Canuck, Thanks for sharing your trades with us. One thing I can always say about your trades is that they are -- smart. I've watched many of your trades (both in the forum and in our trading room), and admire your ability to roll a variety of techniques into one golden trading bag; more often than not it brings you +pips. Quick comment: When stochs are about to head into ob/s, this does not necessarily mean the trade is over. As you've noted, this did not stop you from entering the trade. Spud said that this is where the money is made, and stochs can remain ob/s for a very long time while pips continue to accrue. So, regardless of timeframe, folks should be aware of price action/pivots/S&amp;R levels to best tell you when to exit. Have a safe and healthy holiday, see you next week!

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Thanks Boxing, Your explanation is much appreciated. Enjoy the holiday!

Hey Jeff, I have been mixing a lot of different stochastic indicators together and when they all are in sync, it's a winner for sure. But the single biggest difference lately is trading H1 and H4 using 5-3-3 for entry and following the trade into oversold or overbought territory and/or letting the trade run to the next S&amp;R level. But your point seems to be bang on...the real money is to made when price runs for several bars OS or OB. I'm attaching an indicator I sometimes use...that colors the candle when ob or os. Use it with a 5-3-3 stoch setting and you'll see what I mean about not exiting right away when the stoch hits 80 or 20. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hi Canuck, I wrote a similar indicator for myself! It definitely helps to easier track overbought and oversold conditions. Great minds think alike?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Thanks melpheos. I was noticing a repaint of one bar (maybe 2) on a new trend until the trend got esablished, and on lower timeframes, and I was waiting for 3 to 4 bars to build. I figured it was like stochastics, or many other indicators for that matter, they often look different at the beginning and end of a bar. It doesn't seem to be influencing my decision to trade very much except to help me pull the trigger once I've decisded on a direction...not sure if it's a keeper. Cheers, CanuckCT the the

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Here's another look I've been using from a thread I read http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=29430 The system uses a stochastic momentum indicator - similar to stochastics, just a bit smoother and it uses a -50,0,+50 and stoch crossing for entries. On the charts above you can see how the H1 and H4 were in agreement a few hours ago...I missed the entry (sleeping). It is not consistent with the daily but the daily does take a while to turn and you can trade without agreement on the daily. When everything is in agreement, the trade will be a larger pip move in your favour. My candles are colored using a 5-3-3 stochastic. I suppose this might be considered a buy the way the H4 SMI looks (it's +20 in the time it's taken me to finish this post and in particular the H4 threads are forming nicely for a long), but I won't be trading real $ today. Happy new year folks! Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I'm in demo mode today...but nonetheless, the setups are still what I'm using. Currently in a sell on EURUSD and a buy on USDCHF. Closed USDCHF at the pivot for +17 and closed EURUSD for +28 because is stalled and didn't get to S1 and I have to go. These setups are what I like...you can see the daily stoch is starting to turn in ob or os territory. As the daily stoch starts to move out over the next few days, if it does, watch for H1 and H4 for potential moves. Cheers and see you in 2008. CanuckCT

Morning Marcin and a Happy New Year to everyone. I noticed that as well. No news releases that I know of. It could just be volatility you sometimes get before and after holidays - interbank rate setting, profit taking, whatever. I did read this at trade the news dot com, though: "The AUD is higher against both the USD and JPY on yield differentials as the AUD/USD pair is currently testing the $0.8800 level" and as my and many other brokers were closed when this announcement was made maybe that was the cause - a bit of catching up. Possibly try asking the question on another thread? You'll always get an opinion from me but it doesn't mean I know what I'm doing.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Are you looking at USD/CHF and EUR/USD to fill the gaps? What do you think of these potential trades?

thanks Smikester for your opinon. regarding to your question I am just waiting for right position of stochastics which is my only idicator of potential entry.

Good morning, Hope you all enjoyed a great holiday. I wish everyone a very happy and healthy New Year! Here's a trade I took this morning, based on boxingislife's sexy trade strategy. I'm showing three charts, right to left: H4 - Obviously oversold and in deep downtrend H1 - Same on this lower timeframe H5 - Could not get one pullback on the higher timeframes so I took this one on the M5. I entered as the 5-3-3 crossed down past the 80 level, and immediately took 25 pips heat (didn't like that too much). But, I stayed with it and exited -- accidentally -- with +16 pips (very twitchy trigger finger). As I write this, price is still moving for more than +40. I took a ten-day holiday from trading, so it feels really good to be back. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Thanks for another good chart Marcin. What got you into this trade? The 15 and 30 crossing the 50 line? The first close of the 15 and/or 30 with the stochastics pointing up?

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Here are two false moves that occurred today on the GBPJPY M5 chart. The first one occurred around 2:00 PM EST. The 5-3-3 had actually first crossed down below 80 but repainted itself after I had entered short. Cost me -37 pips (ouch -- just smack me for entering so late in the day!). It eventually went my direction, but my SL would have had to set to around -75 for me to have exited in profit. The later one is still hanging up in the air as I write. One lesson here is that stochastics are great when you have volume. Once the session gets sluggish you should probably shut off your computer and go out and play, as price tends to drift all over the place rather than trend, and stochs then become relatively useless, especially on short-term charts. That said, there is another way to look at this: My first attempt went bad, and I lost -37 -- not horrible on this pair. When the 5-3-3 crossed back down for the second time (immediately after the first circle), I should have taken that trade (I believe a really smart trader would have taken it), since a failed move often indicates that a successful move will occur on the second (or third) attempt. Had I taken it, I would have profited by +50 pips! Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hi Jeff, the first thing I notice is that had you waited for a candle to close with the stoch below 80 you would have been kept out of the first false move down and out of the second trade entirely. I'm still waffling myself on whether to wait for candles to close or not, but I like the idea of going safe, waiting for the close, and just catching a part of the move, and not all of the move.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Ocelot for me it was a kind of trade where all stochastic were pointing in one direction.As you can see it was not a clasic escalator as 1hour stoch was quite high and it was pointing up but the bar was not close. 4H stoch crossed 20 and looked good,15/30 very tight together,strong pointing up and just crossing 50 line which is good sign for me.So my only worry was 1Hour but 4H and 15/30 were perfect for me.I decided it was safe trade for 10 pips.The move was over 80 pips and it was very fast move but later the price went down and none of stochastics reached 80 line. So I was aware i was aiming for 10 pips and it that this trade was far away from clasic escalator,but to be honest I thought the 15/30M will reach 80 line.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I know this feeling Jeff Good to see you

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Jeff I dont trade sexy back,but I agree that trading at the time when the price move slowly is not very safe. I try to trade from 6 am to 16 pm (GMT +1) and most off my loosing trade happened during the slow time. I am going sleep but you can keep an aye on G/J,E/j,U/j.It looks like a nice short can happen.The 15M stoch drift apart leaving the others in overbought area.It looks very good for now.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi Ocelot, You may be right about waiting for candles to close. Will this stop the stoch from repainting any further? When I took this trade the candle had closed and the stoch had fallen well below 80. Of course, the chart looks different now. Should I have waited for yet another candle close? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hi Marcin, Yes, it looks like a nice rubberband setup on GBPJPY, the only pair I'm trading right now. Unfortunately, everything seems to have stopped cold, so this trade will not happen until later in the day, once there is more action in the markets. Nice to see you, too. Hope you have a nice snooze!

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Are you using a custom stochastic indicator? A standard stochastic indicator won't repaint once a candle is closed, but I know that some of the ones that have been customized for use with spud's systems have had that problem.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Mine is definitely customized, and it definitely repaints. I can sometimes watch it wiggle all around while price does the same...

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Is anyone here doing 'set it and forget it' trades using any of the mtf systems? Marcin, and anyone else going for small profit targets (10 pips or so) are you monitoring your trades closely or just putting in stop loss and take profit orders and walking away? ocelot (who is lazy)

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi Ocelot, I never just walk away.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Ocelot, I had my largest trade to date today when I sold GBPJPY, set my stop and walked away for two + hours. I'm trading longer time frames now and have to let the trades work a bit. I'm trading 5-3-3 on H1, H4 and daily. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi Canuck, Nice trending day for GJ! What kind of drawdown are you seeing on the longer timeframes, on average? How deep are you placing your stops? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Here are two trades I took this evening, both for +10 pips. These occurred during the asian session and as you can see the market was ranging. This is pretty typical for the asian session even with yen-based pairs unless there's a big news announcement, or like, a war. The stochs were coming up out of oversold and a bit jumbled but I liked the fact that the 15m on both trades had crossed above the 50. The 15m started to turn over before reaching the 80 level but I held on for my profit target. As you can also see this would have been a good trade to hold onto once it moved into overbought as it gave even more pips there.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
my entrey on ej exit with 10 pips just in in one minute,very nice The move now is over 30 pips

--- 帖子 #735 ---
set it and forget it for me do not have sense when trading with mtf stoch. I always put initial stop loss at 50 pips but this SL do not stop bad trade,it is to protect my account just in case something abnormal happen(war...). My initial SL is almost never hit.when I am in trade and the price go against me I watch how the stochs behave.If ,for example, 15M stoch move against me I watch carefuly what effect it have on other stochs.If 30 M do not react at all or react very slowly I know I can stay in a trade.If 30 and 15 M go against me but 1H and 4H do not react at all I still consider to stay in a trade. so leaving my computer when being in trade do not have sense as trading in the way Spud learn us reguire us to watch it all the time. Anaway that is what I am doing.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Ej now looks interesting. 1h/30/15 went into overbought and the 4 h is still below 20.It can lead to nice short.I hope stochs will show us the way. Daily is just crossing 20 down which is good.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hello, Hope everyone is healthy &amp; happy . Take a look at the chart. The stoch are nice and tigh right now...potential for an escalator. We will see.... remember that the stoch look easier after the fact..price action rules but we are looking for the 15/30/60 to work in unison...ideally... of course keep your eye on the 4hr trend. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hello Folks, Here is a follow up to my previous post... as you can see the stoch moved significantly but because of the time of the day, its movement does not coincide with the price going up that much. I managed to squeeze 6 pips but I got out.... until a more volatile time.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Moneda you are lucky you got your 6 pips,1H stoch did not even close above 20 line so it was pretty rhttp://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif Thumbs upisky trade. be carefull

--- 帖子 #741 ---
sorry , I got some problem with computer, just wanted to say to Moneda,that the 1H stoch did not even close above 20 line so I consider it was very risky trade

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi Marcin, My first chart talks about the potential for a trade...I did not enter at that point. The second is after the fact. I think that it was not an ideal entry due to the time of day but not as risky as you say. I do think though that I tend to be more adventureous than you...these are pros and cons that fit my style. Discretion after looking at the stochs, price action, pivot points, daily range etc. is something that we all apply to the way we trade. Keep up your good work and thanks for the feedback.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi Moneda, Looks to me like the price did move pretty nicely from the time your M15 crossed the 20 level. I don't see much risk here, either, since it appears that all three stochs had crossed up (not sure why Marcin thinks the H1 did not cross up). And, I'm not sure what time you took that trade. I suspect you simply entered a little later than optimal. I notice you are using LaGuerre indicators. Do those replace some of your stochs? Anyhow, don't feel bad -- your 6 pips is a good trade! Please don't allow yourself to be influenced by others into thinking that trades with less than 10 pips are somehow "puny" or "unmanly." We all trade different styles that uniquely suit our own personalities, and as long as you come out ahead at the end of the day, you're doing really well. If it makes you feel any better, I took a trade earlier this morning on GBPJPY that moved a full 80 pips against me before coming my way. I was determined not to let it take my money this time, and I'm experimenting with some new strategies. Well, after lots of sweat, it finally went +16 in my direction but began to retrace really fast so I got out with only +1 pip!! That trade took half the morning and put me through the ringer, but it was a good exercise and learning experience. No, really, it was murder!! Anyhow, I felt great afterward! Have fun...

--- 帖子 #744 ---
I couldnt resist to take this trade although that is the bad time to trade. I managed to take 7 pips but the move was much bigger have a safety trading , I am going sleep

Nice trade, Marcin, I will call this stochastic shape, "The Praying Mantis." Sleep well!

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi Jeff, Wow, that was some kind of experience for you! I know from previous conversations that you rarely like to go more than 20 pips negative... good job.... you have to develop nerves of steel to trade the g/y . On my charts I dont show laguerre indicators although I am experimenting with them..those are mtf stochs. In the upper window I have a stoch on a chart indicator with a 84 sma in the middle and an indicator alerting when price closes above/below the 84. Take care,

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hi Moneda, In your lower indicator window, right after M15 stoch, it says, "Laguerre," and that's why I asked... Yes, nerves of steel will definitely help...

Hi everyone, There was some great trading tonight! I made 3 profitable trades: AUDJPY, GBPJPY, and EURJPY for +10, +20, and +10 pips respectively. Notes: - More and more I'm liking waiting for the 15m to break over the 50 level to act as confirmation of a move. - The 15m pullback that occurred on the GBPJPY and EURJPY was a bit nerve-wracking but since the 1h stoch remained unaffected I held the trade and eventually hit my profit target on both pairs. - Since the 4h was above 20 and moving up I could have followed the escalator rules and waited for either the 30m or 1h to hit 80 and then take profits. Since I didn't do that, I left quite a few pips on the table, but for now I'm just focusing on reliably getting 10 pips (20 on more volatile pairs like the GBPJPY) - AUDJPY and GBPJPY are too closely correlated, I don't think I'll trade the two simultaneously again. In fact, look at the charts for the two this evening, they're almost identical! To a lesser degree this is also true of the EURJPY. I'm attracted to the yen-crosses 1. for volatility, and 2. they'll actually move during the asian session which is the most convenient time for me to trade. I think I'll look for other pairs that are less correlated but still might see some movement in the asian session. Otherwise I think I may focus on a yen cross or two, and a major and just stay up for the opening of the london session. This week's results: 8 winners, 0 losers, +90 pips total!

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Jeff, Okay Sherlock yes, I changed their color to that of the background because they were not part of the trade nor discussed in this wonderful thread.

Nice trading guys, Charts nice and clear, too, really helps to understand what you're doing -- thanks! I picked up +14 today on GBPJPY, learning that this pair goes both ways no matter where, when, or how you enter. It's just a matter of toughing it out! Three charts: 5M/15M/30M all show the same strong downtrend blue line (25-10-10, 20-10-20 on the M5 chart). 5-3-3 on both the M5 &amp; M15 charts pull back and cross their signals back down below the 50 level, and I entered. Could have held for more, but was happy where I exited. Hope everyone has a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #754 ---
canuck can you please give me more info on your indicator. is it green on overbought or oversold thanks.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hey lotsofmoney, Here it is. I've modified the original indicator to only color the OB and OS candles and not the candles bewteen 20 and 80. You set the stochastic value and see how it colors the candles. I find it useful to show you just how long price can stay OB and OS. I've been studying what price does when the 14-3-3 stochastic is in OB and OS territory. The question I always have is what should I do when the stochastic crosses when in OB or OS territory. What I have found is that if the 14-3-3 stochastic crosses back while OB or OS and does not make it past the 80/20 line, that is a very good indiction that the move will continue on in OB and OS for further candles and is evidence that there is a retrace happening and not a reversal. My 2 cents. Cheers, CanuckCT

Hey everyone, As you know, I am not a big fan of scalping, but I may be having a change of heart. I have been playing with the Slow Stoch on the 5 min GBP/JPY chart. Using the 5,3,3 setup, there are some very predictable and profitable moves that occur in high volatility times. The reason I mention this is because it does fit in with my philosophy of taking 3-5 pips at a time. Most moves seem to cover a 20-30 pip range in 15-30 minutes. I would like some feed back from some of you other stoch folks, are you seeing what I am seeing and can it really be that easy to make 10-20 pips a day off of a 5 min chart? I'm not sure how it would work on other pairs, but with this pair, the volatility is almost always there. Let me know what you think...

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hi PipAV8tor, I've been playing with the same pair for a couple of weeks now, also using 5-3-3 on the 5 min chart, and you are absolutely right. The biggest problem is the lack of stability with the M5 timeframe. Price direction can and does change rather rapidly and I've had some pretty severe drawdowns (40-80 pips at times) after entering some trades. Nevertheless, I like the pair and find its volatility quite appealing. I've been trading mostly the "sexy" setup, waiting for the end of the retrace in a strong trend. What kind of setups do you look for?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hey Pip... good to see ya. I have been using Spud's scalping method using the 30, 15, and 5 min. charts. I trade the Eur/Usd because of the low spread (2-3) pips. I had a positive November and December and I picked up 7 pips on one trade this morning before work. T4K

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi PipAv8tor, Some charts would be nice. Scalping gbp/jpy is tricky business, because it can move over 10 ticks in one go. Scalping usually would entail higher leverage since we are going for smaller gains, so not sure if one would be willing to take a higher size position GJ with its sporadic movement. I scalp eur/usd on 0.9pip, doesn't take too much movement to come into profit with it. But I am always willing to change my opinion. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Basically, the only real method I have been using is waiting for the 5,3,3 to cross over 20 headed to 80 or 80 headed toward 20. That move from one to the other is usually 2 or maybe 3 of the 5 min candles. It can be 4 or 5 but it moves pretty quickly. It is a very quick trade, just looking for that 3-5 pips. I also have the 14,3,3 stoch there to confirm direction and help determine the exit. I do have the mac-d and rsi there as well, but they are very secondary and there pretty much to confirm volume. Almost all of the swings in either direction today were of the 20-30 pip variety with no re-trace surprises. Since 5pm CST, there have been 7 very predictable moves and each was an easy 5-10 pip safe profit. I tried to post a screen shot but I am having difficulties.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Thanks for the details pip. Shall await ur pic attachment. Out of curiosity, those trades you are talking about, were they in both directions? ie long and short, or just in one direction? I have found with scalping, that you increase your chances of a positive trade if you trade in the direction of the primary move, ie with a directional bias. Really looking forward to discussing this further, as I have been trying to find something to increase the odds of taking 10 pips or so on a GJ 5M candle. Regards, K.

H4 under 80, M15 had crossed down and M30 and H1 were also down. Easy 20 pips with little heat. Also price had moved below R1 and lots of room to pivot. I probably exited too early but once I have 20 pips I'm grabbing it unless I can pay full attention to the trade. This one taken while at work. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi Canuck, Nice trading, as usual! But I'm not sure exactly where you entered (I apologize if it's obvious). Also, do you feel that the H4 below 80 is pretty much the same as if it's below 20? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #766 ---
KV, H4 stochastic had made a turn - u can see it better on the H4 timeframe, although it was not as pronounced as it is now. It's the same as having H4 oversold. H4 trend is down and it's a high percentage trade on M15. Just wish I had followed it to the pivot. BTW, is there any interest in continuing the trading room. I never see anyone there. Cheers, CanuckCT After I posted this entered short again based on H4 stoch...short at 214.80 and closed for +10.

If you want a better view, email me and I will send it to you. These moves are from today, approx 10 am EST to 4 pm EST on the 5 min chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) sorry, it looks huge on my screen.

Canuck, Thanks for the explanation and nice chart! Regarding the trading room -- I do check in at least once a day, but have not found anyone there as yet, nor has anyone shown up after at least an hour of my entry, since the holidays. I think it's a great idea, but I believe the entrance may just be a little too imposing for the majority (i.e., downloading and installing the software). The half-dozen or so of us who do check in can't seem to get there together, so it seems like a bust for now. Frankly, it would be easier to just go back to IM like we used to. However... I have another idea. There are quite a few folks who regularly frequent this thread, so the easiest thing would be for me to just open the gates, and invite everyone to join in right here, whenever they are in the trading mood, not just to discuss "the Art..." I think I'll post a notice to that effect, and see if we can get a nice, busy trading room going here -- related, of course, to MTF Stochastic trading. Wouldn't really be much different, and all subscribers would be alerted to new posts. I could sure use a sounding board or two, since I still manage to get killed on occasion (see my next post). What do ya think?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Canuck, Hind sight is 20/20 of course, but that was/is a beautiful setup for the escalator. As I type this, H4 stoch is nearing 20 and price has been as low as 214. Finding those rare big moves with near perfect setups is hard and sometimes you just got to let it run a little. Very nice trade!!

Hi Pip, Thanks for posting your chart. Don't know why it's so small, but it's not a problem. I must warn you that these charts can be quite deceiving, especially on GBPJPY. Within any 50 pip move south, there are numerous surges north, and vice-versa. It can be frightening to take a trade and watch it go against you, yet this fear is rarely reflected in the charts that follow. For example, I took what I thought was a good trade this morning, just about 10:00 Eastern... It was a short (sell) trade in a nice trend based on a chart setup that I've used to success in the past. However, the moment I entered, it was as if I had ignited a rocket to the moon, and the thing just took off against me at break-neck speed, with hardly a retrace. I got out -58 pips, killing my week (and my confidence), and watched it continue to rise until it had reached -75 from my entry. Right now, had I remained in the trade, I'd be +120 pips, according to the chart. Frustrating, for sure, and too easy to see how I could have done so well, after the fact. But, the reality is, if I break the chart up into very little pieces for close post-trade scrutiny, it is unlikely that I would have remained in the trade for the duration. Too many retraces along the way. Lots of noise spikes on this pair, more than any other I am aware of. Very appealing for traders looking for 20 or more per trade. You are correct in that there are some rather substantial moves to either side where it should be easy to pick up a simple 5 pip gain. But, the average spread on this pair is at least that much, so in reality you have to plan on gaining 5 pips plus the spread, just to net 5. And, in that process, if it goes just 5 against you (which it can do in a blink), you're already down 10 pips. Seems a difficult pair to play for such small desires. In my mind, going to GBPJPY for 3-5 pip gains is akin to taking a 60-foot fishing vessel out into the middle of the Atlantic, looking for minnows. Waters too choppy, costs too high and just too much risk. Now, if you were looking for sharks, that would be another story. If I were looking for 3-5 pip trades, I would look at other -- less heart-stopping -- pairs like EURUSD or AUDUSD which both have much tighter spreads and will treat you better in the short term with their relatively docile price action, by comparison. Just my opinion, of course. You might play on demo for a week or so, to get the feel, and see if it works for you...

Jeff, There is definitely volatility, but that 20 to 80 and back to 20 move is almost as regular as big Ben. It is working very well in Demo mode, but I haven't done it live yet. The channeling environment we are in right now has me somewhat concerned. That is why I threw the idea out there, to get feedback, so thanks. I am gonna continue to look at it. Just in the 4 moves today, there were a lot of pretty safe pips and there is no doubt that these trades are the quick in/out type, not the let er run type.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Pip, You're right - it does swing back and forth all day long. I know, I frequently trade the 5.3.3 on the M5 chart (looking for bigger gains). But, take a look at this action. I took the swing down, just after the 5.3.3 had crossed below 80. It might have given me 5, if I recall correctly. But then, it got snapped away like lightning and moved up another 80 pips. My original stop was 5 more above that but, because of the velocity of the move I decided to get out at -58 (bad move in retrospect, because it never did hit my SL. Ahhh -- retrospect ). That little retrace back up of the 5.3.3 represents a full 80 pip swing. So, while the stoch swings back and forth like clockwork, please keep your eye on all the "noise" that occurs along with it. Now, having said all that, it is entirely possible that trading for just 5 pips and getting the heck out of the battlefiled may actually be the much safer/smarter way to trade this pair. I've had lots of trades go +5 before going -40, so you may be on to something, and I won't ever close my mind to a better idea... I'd like to see you post some of your demo trades, to see exactly where you're entering and exiting. I happen to be a personal fan of quick in/out trading Thanks much!

Hi jeff , just getting the hang of the stochs now, still cant load them properly on my MT4 for some reason , but ive got enough to get me by, I,m only a beginner,Ive dabbled for a year or two but ive done mind boggling research and trials with numerous indicators and methods on this site, and have settled with imran,s lag,s for main trades using m5 which im quite happy with, like you say nail biting moves against you at times with gbp/jpy,especially as im trading live, how come the pips always go a lot quicker against you than for you!! however ive come to the conclusion you cant beat stochs and now what i do is flick from m5 to m1 as im in the trend, following the stochs, and on m1 you can then follow the pullback movement, and sometimes trade them aswell, this also gives v good entry for re entering trend with minimal drawdowns, this way i find you can avoid being alarmed by the pip movement, thanks to you and the loyal band of followers for your posts, hope my bit helps, Francis

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Jeff, I can't seem to find that action on my chart. It is from today at 14:45 right? That is within the same time frame as the chart I posted and I don't see that jump. See if you can look at my post and match up that pattern. For reference, where I typed in "140 pip move" is right at the 14:45 time. Also, I believe in the tight stop on this pair, 10 pips + spread above or below my entry price. I can make up for a 10 pip loss fairly easily, but 40 or 50 really puts "pressure" on yourself to get it all back right away. Kind of a mind game, I guess. I think I found the move at about 12:45 on my chart. If that is right, then I am kind of curious why you went with a sell. If I have the time right, everything was setting up for a buy and was actually trade 3 that I posted on my chart. I may be wrong on that...

Hi All, As many of you know, a number of us have been getting together from time to time in a separate trading room. It's been great, and we've learned a few things in the process. Unfortunately, most stayed away, and I suspect the main reason is the extra steps involved with downloading, installing and setting up the software. So, I'd like to invite EVERYONE who feels like trading, to simply use this forum as a trading room! HOW: 1. If you see a setup that interests you, post it here for discussion. 2. If you've already entered a trade, tell us what pair, what price you entered, why you took the trade and other details like SL &amp; TP targets. 3. We're trading MTF Stochastics here. We're learning and sharing, banging ideas off one another, in an effort to refine our art. And, it is an art! 4. Make sure you're subscribed to this thread, so that you will be notified soon after anyone posts a new message. 5. As always, feel free to post your charts (we all love to see them), whether prior to a trade, in a trade or afterward, for discussion or simply to share your winners and losers. If you need help getting your charts posted, please ask and I'm certain you will receive immediate assistance from our friendly members. 6. Ask questions if you don't understand something. We are here to learn, and everyone's questions are important.

A MUST read!! I sure wish he would come back... It has taken me months to realize what he meant when he wrote that, but I get it now and it is true. We tend to over think and over analyze and it really can be as simple as watching the 5,3,3 stoch bounce between the 20 and 80 on the 5 min chart. Also, for Jeff But, take a look at this action. I took the swing down, just after the 5.3.3 had crossed below 80. It might have given me 5, if I recall correctly. But then, it got snapped away like lightning and moved up another 80 pips. My original stop was 5 more above that but, because of the velocity of the move I decided to get out at -58 (bad move in retrospect, because it never did hit my SL. Ahhh -- retrospect ). There was an announcement, US consumer Credit at 3 EST that could have caused your "bump". It was much better than expected so it could have had an effect.

Hi Francis, Never thought about trading M1 on GBPJPY; I'll take a look next session. Oh wait -- I can't. For some reason, whenever I go to M1 on my MT4 platform, the whole program hangs up. Weird, huh? So much for that idea I've also looked over many different ideas and systems, but I always come back to MTF Stochastics. Just makes for sensible trading. It's all the nuance that makes it a study.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hey Pip, You know, my setup is probably different than yours. Different from most, in fact. I have my stochs on that chart set to close/close instead of hi/lo, and that probably accounts for our difference. I get a bit more "action" than you, but I'm not sure if this is a good thing or bad I think I will return to basics tomorrow, since most people are using the hi/lo settings. No doubt, over time some of my settings have strayed a bit from the originals; not sure if this hurts or helps me, but I will surely be better served by keeping my settings the same as everyone else, and staying on the same page! According to my notes, I traded against a rubberband setup with a high H4, since I had concurrence of a downtrending 25-10-20 stoch on several time frames. I was sure the long move was over (oh yeah). During the trade I sensed I had made an error, and realized I should have stayed with the rubberband -- which turned out to be perfect and would have yielded an easy 75 pips! Sometimes I get a little screwy with my trading, but I'm learning every day.

The LFB team has a GREAT post on the news side. It explains a lot about indicators and trending vs. channeling markets. It was a great review for me and would be excellent for newbies to expand their knowledge. Check it out if you can. Link: http://forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;id=63996 Just saw this in another thread and it rang a bell with me : "Despite how good a trade setup is and how much time you’ve contributed to it’s technical or fundamental analysis, you should never get caught up in the illusion that the market has sympathy for your efforts. The perfect setup does not guarantee the perfect trade, in fact, it does not guarantee even the most modest of trades. It is important that we understand this because in this business the only thing we have control off, is how fast we can loose our money, everything else is left to forces too powerful for us to reckon with. You're always wrong until the market proves you otherwise by blessing you with a profitable trade."

hey pip, I've been experimenting with using just the 5-3-5 stoch cross (it's a bit smoother than 5-3-3 for M5 timeframe on GBPJPY) for entry on M5 with MACD for confirmation. Three trades this morning, +20,+20,+10 and now I'm done for the day. Since M5 ranges all day, seems like a very active strategy with a ton a trade oppoutunities. Also seems to work well on other volatile pairs. Less volatile pairs might work better with a 5-3-3 stoch setting. I think this is a very tradeable strategy (I need to write down the rules for entry) and one I'll be using for the next few weeks. Looks like it may be good for harvesting easy pips rather than waiting for good setups on longer time frames and not trading at all (for those that want to be more active). You can trade the range using this and wait patiently for the longer time frame setups to come and avoid jumping on to a longer time frame trade that is not a good setup. If you do catch one that runs based on a longer time frame, you should have a good entry point. That can be identified by simply changing the timeframe once you are up say 20 pips. If there is no clear setup on the longer time frame, exit with you pips and wait for the next move - usually within the hour. What do you think of MACD for confirmation? I have 5-13-1 for my macd settings and they are the same as the settings of that very popular 4 Hour Strategy (MACD) thread. By the way, that is an excellent thread. And MACD has decent pattern recognition on M5. Since MACD is also a moving average osscilator, it seems like they are a good complement for each other without having indicatoritis. BTW, just entered my forth short. Guess I'm not done for the day yet. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Hi Canuck, Nice work this morning! I'd be most interested in seeing your rules, once you put them into place. Are you entering on simple swings, or are you waiting for the 5.3.5 to first go ob/s? Was a beautiful day here on Long Island yesterday, with temps over 60f. After I returned from lunch I went for a bike ride, which felt great and really cleared my head. Probably won't get to do that again until mid-March! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Canuck, The default setting for Mac-d on my platform is 12,26,9 and I think that is very good for the 15 and larger time frames. For the 5 min, the 12,20,9 works well, as it reflects more recent history. Other smaller numbers may work, but I try to use mac-d to find divergence, so you want a sampling of many recent candles. The stoch will and should initially be somewhat opposite of mac-d when you first think of entering. The mac-d used in conjunction with the stoch helps to find duration of a move and shows when momentum is with you or changing. The stoch is definitely the lead indicator and can be used all by itself (IMHO) for trading on the 5 min chart. However, if you read the post from The LFB, during trending markets, when the stoch tends to stay ob/s for longer periods of time, it loses some amount of accuracy and that is where the mac-d really becomes valuable for duration. I think trading the 5 min is still risky and the s/l should remain tight, but as you noted and as Spud pointed out, there are literally a hundred opportunities a day. To get 10-20 pips a day seems almost too easy. I plan to keep doing the demo trading with it this week, but I plan to use it in my live account next week, unless I find a flaw. Update as of 2 pm est. 2 trades today, using the 5 min chart and 5,3,3 stoch. +36 pips and +18 pips. both as sell.

Hi guys. I see a few of you are trading the G/J and I also see your looking for 5 pips.. I have been trading the G/J for many years and I hope I can add something to your trading to help you ,also newbie stay away from this pair......you need several years experince and a large account......Trust me..lol The G/J retraces from a move it will nearly always go to the 5sma, so follow it back up and set your TP at the 5sma on the 1hr/4hr and daily, the stronger the move the bigger the pull back. If you have a big move on the 1hr or 4hr candle wait for the next candle look for a pin bar or head and shoulders and the new candle will retrace. The G/J ( as all JAP pairs do) love fib no's...so look to the fib lines or in my case MM lines. I never trade this pair off anything below 1hr.....anything below this TF is suicide. Use the 5sma as your SL.......therefore be prepared to have a 100 pip + SL.. I have a special chart setup just for the G/J.... Remember this pair have historical spent more time long then short. And as a side note......I would take anywhere from 100-300 pips a day out of the G/J... I hope this helps, keep up the good work.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #787 ---
I forgot to add the G/J follows the DOW index..... Glenn

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi Glenn, Thanks for your insight. The 5sma is a great way to see your risk right in front of you. Another contributor some time back had suggested the 4ema +15 for SL and it also seems to hold well for this particular pair. That is, as long as you've got the stomach to watch your price go there! Good trading!

--- 帖子 #789 ---
This is a trade I have right now just to show the setup working... I will up date this trade later.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Closed the trade on the 3/8 line as the momentum shows a fall back...profit of 70 pips..... Glenn

--- 帖子 #791 ---
To add why I exited the trade when my indicators showed a possible strong move long.... the time is between NEW YORK close and TOKYO open therefore low volume and its against the present trend... I will wait till TOKYO stock market opens then see if the move will contiune..

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Nice trading, Glenn, Thanks for sharing your setup; very clear, very helpful. Do your fib lines redraw automatically once per day?

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Thankyou....after 7 years you would think I have learned something...lol Yes the Murry Math lines draw automatically.....working of the Gann octaves... Glenn

--- 帖子 #794 ---
The market seems more active than usual for this time of day. Nevertheless, I also prefer not to trade when volume is down, since the market tends to drift off in all directions. Tnanks...

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Your time in the game sure does make a big difference. Experience is something we just can't buy! Thanks for the Murray Math info!

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Should also add the following pic.. I hope this helps..

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hi Glen, I would love to know more about your strategy. What are the settingd for the indicators and how you use them. Are you consistently getting that many pips a day from the geppy...if so great?? What is the indicator on the screen and how are you using it...the one dividing things into 1/8, 2/8 etc? Thank you...I am intrigued...Joe

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Hi Joe. The indicator is a Murry Math indicator, and it works of the Gann octaves of 8-8ths....therefore the move from high to low is broken into 1/8th segments, the idea is if the pair are trading at say 8/8 or +1/8 then it is over bought and you should look for a fall back ( confirmed by the other indicators). Therefore the idea is to trade the pair from 8/8 back to 4/8 and from 1/8 to 4/8, converting it to fib's that would be 0 to 50% and 100% back to 50%....of course its only a guide and needs to be confirmed by the other indicators, however its uncanny how the pair moves within the segments... I have posted the indicator I use below..with some doc's that I hope explain it better then I can.... I dont want to get to much into the indicators I use as I do not want to take this thread away from the stoch indicators... In answer to your question about the pips , I also trade long term using Elliot waves and I trade multi lots, but in short yes 100 + pips from the G/J is correct, you will see I have posted charts that show I have allready take 70 pips this morning ( good start to Thursday) Glenn

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Thanks Glenn, so do you use the rope indicator for entry like Spud says or do you utilize something else for entry on the one hour and up charts?? Thank you in advance...Joe

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Hi Joe. Yes you will see on my charts the stoch setup, I use it in conjuction with the other indicators, MM lines and candle patterns.. I started using stoch indicators a long time ago when I discovered the rainbow method by Guppy, I converted that method to a method I could use and then when I saw spuds thread I just used some of the ideas, my method is a setup that suites me and is cobbled together from many ideas and method from many other people. Glenn

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Nice trades today PIP and all you are using is the 5.3.3 stoch? Are you looking at the upper time frames for direction? T4K

--- 帖子 #802 ---
T4K, The only thing that I am doing is making sure that I don't go against the 15m chart, so no sell if the stoch on the 15m is moving up from 20 etc.... The 15 min is channeling also, just not as quiclkly as the 5 min moves, obviously. I did 2 more trades later in the day for +6 and +9. Each trade today, I was into profit almost immediately and out very quickly, 10-15 mins. I am still kind of baffled by how simple it seems. :

--- 帖子 #803 ---
This is the Euro....present chart....I have not taken the trade as I am concerned about the volume and the other points I raise in the pic... The point of me posting this is to show when i would not enter.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #804 ---
I understand what you mean about the simplicity factor. My thoughts have always been if something in this business isn't difficult it can't work. Maybe we have been making it too hard all along. Time will tell! T4K

I'll try and post some charts tomorrow. I seem to have trouble getting them to look good on here. They look great when I upload them. Not sure what I am doing wrong.

Short entry on GJ as follows: 5-3-5 stoch had crossed down. It didn't make it all the way to overbought but after the cross went below 50. As confirmation for the entry I referred to macd and momentum and both were showing a sell. Short at 215.35. Stop is 5sma using close + 15. I've added the absolute strength indicator Glenn used. Had tinkered with that before but never really knew what to do with it. It and macd are for confirmation only, stoch is for entry. So I guess it's still ok to post it here. But I'm wondering Jeff if I'm straying from using MTF stochastics a little to far here. I'm also including the H1 chart which also shows the current trend on H1 is down. Will jump to higher timeframe if bigger trend develops but still experimenting with how to do that. Two things that concerned me about the trade..pivot was 215.19 and the round number 215. I adjust my stop at 5 minute intervals. Currently +100. Cheers, CanuckCT EDIT - stopped for +95

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hi Canuck, Great trading! I like your new approach, and I think it's exciting that in the last few days we're seeing lots of fresh ideas. I have no problem with your indicators. We all use 'em to one degree or another and even though we are trading MTF Stochastics, there's nothing wrong with a little confirmation. My only comment is that I don't think you really need more than one or two indicators if you're trading MTF Stochastics, since the concept is to simplify things, not complicate them. So, you're still trading MTFS. I'll only complain when the topic turns to requests for EA's and indicator mods, or when your methods no longer have much to do with MTFS. THanks for your charts. Hope to see some rules soon!

--- 帖子 #809 ---
my trade on uj for 10 pips. It is a kind of a clasic escalatoe with all stoch pointing in one direction.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Currently in a long trade per the attached chart - target set for 214.85 - target hit before I could post the chart. +22 on the trade. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Canuck, glad to see the 5 min is working for you. I'm a believer, at least with the way the market has been lately. This pair has channeled between 214 and 216 for awhile. It will eventually breakout, hopefully higher as I am sitting on a long term buy. I am curious to see if the plucking of pips will be as easy on the 5 min when it starts trending. I think it will be similar, although I think the number of really good opportunities will diminish some.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hey pip, I'm really liking the m5 entry, thanks to your posting. I've made it my own which is what you really need to do. What I see will be different than the way others see it. 5-3-3 (or 5-3-5 in my case) really does bounce between 20 and 80 all day long. The decision is quick and the move can be quick. And protection of profit is key. It can turn on you very quickly, which I believe is Glenn's point. Best to wait for the trade to come to you rather than force it. That is why I'm waiting for confirmation on M5 before entry. macd helps to identify pullbacks vs reversals for me. GJ can move 50 to 60 pips in 5 minutes. Get on the wrong side of that (which I'm due for), is why you have stops. I did notice the ranging on the H4 chart. Trading M5 is just trading the range. When it does breakout it should be a big move and maybe an M5 entry will catch it. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #813 ---
C, Exactly right. Quick in and out, careful if you blink : but the moves are usually pretty good size. Tight stop is the key. I can lose 10, not 50. I definitely make sure the 15 m is in agreement. It helps if the bigger time frames are also. Making sure there is a "good" cross of the 80/20 is also important. Plenty of room between them, so don't try to anticipate. 20 a day seems pretty simple and that was always Spud's goal.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hey Pip, I was looking at higher tf of H1 for agreement, but agreement of m15 does make the most sense. It seems that a good cross up or below 50 significantly increase the chance of a profitable trade. Here is another trade I'm just exited. Entered at 88.55 - see first chart. The second chart is where it is now. I exited at R3...89.44 (actually 89.40). Got lucky as was on the phone and didn't move my stop up. It would have been hit. AUDUSD is much tamer to trade and seems to be very good every other day. Thanks so much for helping me focus. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Hi Cancuck, Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like one of the signals that gets you in is when the stoch crosses the 50 line, is that right? On another note, after a string of about 9 straight winners I got overconfident started taking some bad trades and have a mixed record so far this week. Once again, the psychological aspect rears it's ugly head. Remember, don't take bad trades! Learn from my example! =)

--- 帖子 #816 ---
CanuckCT I have posted my Absolute strength inicator, which looks different to the one you have on your charts.... As far as useing it goes just wait till the red or blue comes off the bottom , the dotted line cross's the solid line and watch the seperation if it fans out then the move is strong, add a safety mesure you can wait for the red/blue line to cross...the one going up is the trend.... Of course I also use the MA cross and stoch cross the fib lines in a rope....to confirm. Hope this helps.... P.S......I have not traded any of these indicators on a 5min tf as I see you are trading....my main concern with any indicator on a 5 min tf is noise and I really can not see how you can trade the noise....it must reduce your profit/loss ratio per trade and increase your stress level's... I see PIP trade's for a living of a 5min tf, well done I know the stress it can cause.... I prefer to enter trade's and let them run for several days/weeks.....would be intresting what the return % a month is with the different methods... Once again great thread k2kv and all the guys here....Hope my rambling's are usefull Glenn

Hello ocelot, I'm on a bit of a streak this week. I'm due to be creamed here any time. When I do I'll be sure to post it. Here is what I look for: 5-3-5 stoch crossed and I like to see it just cross above or below 50 - that is my signal to enter. Before I enter, I check MACD to see what it is doing. If it looks like it's about to cross zero that seems to be very good. Even better if you wait till it crosses zero. I've added a momentum indicator also - now using the one Glenn provided. I use stoch for entry but then I pay more attention to MACD, momentum, pivots, S&amp;R and round numbers for exit points. Let's say you are short..the stoch might go down to 20 and turn back up. Hopefully you are up a few pips by this time. You could take profits and close because there seem to be lots of trading opportunites. What I'm seeing is that the 5-3-5 can turn back up and if it doesn't make it to 50 it will often turn back down. That's the retrace and the idea is to stay for that retrace and you are probably in for a bigger trade. If the stoch comes back up and price doesn't seem to be moving with it as strongly, that's what I look for. MACD helps to keep me in by also indicating a retrace in happening by not going back to the zero line. If it does head that way you best be careful. I'm attaching the indicators I use for macd...some may find it helpful. EDIT - When I finished this post I had a look at GJ and it fits what I'd look for...I'm not in this trade but would have entered somewhere on the candle after the dotted red line. Cheers, CanuckCT

Hey Glenn, Thanks so much for all your input! Your greater experience lends a somewhat different perspective and authority to your posts and -- I'm paying close attention! You're right about trading M5 charts -- it can be extremely stressful as price jumps all over the place. However, I shy away from longer term charting since -- especially on GBPJPY -- the deeper drawdown one might experience in, say, a full hour, might be even harder to swallow. Frankly, I'd love to trade longer term with less stress, but until I gain more confidence in what I'm doing short-term, I can't imagine moving up. Take care...

Hello, does somebody has some experience with 1439 or Scalping system? I find all Spud systems very effective. Have a great trades Bruno

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Thankyou for your comments. I agree with your comments re: Daily/4hr on the G/J and I would discourage anyone new or with limited experince from trading this pair and would sujest they look at the eur/usd, gbp/usd or the aud/usd......where a SL of 50 pips will be fine..... Of course if you use the Murry math lines you can set your Sl above the 4/8 or 8/8 lines and that should be ok...... When i trade off the dailies i dont use a SL at all......in the last 8 days the G/Y has fallen some 875 pips... and in the last 3 days the Aud/Usd has gone up some 255 pips on its way to 90.00cents plus...and the G/U some fall of 338 pips.... So there is very much a good profit to be made with the slower moving pairs....You should have a look at your stocth setup on a daily you maybe suprise at how clear the signals are . Glenn

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Glen, You are making a very good point here...when you trade a daily chart, are your settings different? And would you place your trade at the close of New Your session? Thanks, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #822 ---
I use a different set of indicators......if k2kv agrees i will post a daily setup....agin one I have cobbled from different methods....I check the charts at the start of the new candle....maybe a 15/20min excerise then I go and do something else. I can not take credit for any of my setups I own it all to the many experts that are members of this great forum.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Hi Glenn, Feel free to post your setup. All I ask is that we keep the discussions primarily related to trading MTF Stochs. It's perfectly fine (and very much appreciated) for you to explain what you're doing so that we can understand it fully, but I would like to remain somewhat focused here. Thanks for asking! Now, I have a question: I've been playing with the MM lines since you posted them, replacing my fibs on just one of my charts, to see if they might work better. Since you mentioned that the GJ tends to fade back and forth from 0/8 - 4/8, etc., earlier today I took a long trade on the H1 chart, from 0/8 (214.02) with a target of 2/2 (214.80) -- hey, I'm not greedy. Sure enough, my target was hit a little while ago for a profit of +78 pips. Did I follow you correctly, or was I just lucky? Most pleasant trade of the last two weeks. Also, the only trade I've taken on a demo in months! To keep the discussion on focus, I should mention that I never trade the H1, so taking a look at my MTF stochs on this chart was quite a revelation -- I had the cleanest, most perfect setup I'd seen all week (and it's been a really bad week here in M5-land), albeit against the main trend. Was the best setup of the day, with 15/30/60 all rising smoothly together to the top, making my target an easy one. I'd like to hear your comments. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi k2kv Yes you followed it correctly......you bought in over sold area..-1/8 and you were wise to take the profit at 3/8 as you were going against the 4hr and daily trend.... Also there was a nice candle setup on the 1hr...showing a retracment and of course as i said before the jap twins love the fib no's so it retracted to the 3/8ths line or 38.2% on the fibs.... I have included my daily.....you will see its very simple and the entry point is at the open of a new candle look at the AO and see if its over the zero line....I also use the stoch rope to confirm but also to jump in some times before the new candle as the new daily candle can reverse..( especialy the G/J) Again the stoch rope entry if different from the new candle is a solid rope passing the outer fib no's..... You will also note that by useing the daily you can see in advance if a pair are setting up....as you can see on the G/J pic, the pair are at 1/8 and the stoch is in over sold area... so I will watching the next few days with intrest....also note how the murry Math lines give us a possible target in the case of a move long...4/8th line 224.81....according to me from wheres its trading at this moment that is around...1038 pips.....of course we will not get all of them but it could be a good move... Glenn

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Those looking for a slower moving pair the G/U looks like it maybe setting up as well..

--- 帖子 #826 ---
K2Kv just looking at your chart again and I see with intrest that both the entry 0/8 and exit 3/8 are close to the pivots on your chart.... That again would confirm the support / resistance of the two areas.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Just to follow alone with the setup....I have included a Daily U/J..todays new candle.... Note I entered on the Stoch, I did not wait for the new bar over the zero on the AO indicator... Again note we are coming off a 1/8 th line.....possible target 4/8th line... 112.45... This trade will either go up or down.....lol...we shall see .. Glenn

PipAV8tor Thanks for the file....I agree it works well.....but I think I will leave you to sit in front of the computer all the time... Glenn

--- 帖子 #830 ---
So Glenn, I presume this to be a buy on the daily. But I'm not getting how MM numbers would be considered. Since it's now trading above 3/8, then the target would be 5/8? That's 163.92ish? Thanks, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #831 ---
my chart was for Usd/Jpy.... althought looking at the chart you posted its a buy as well....just be carefull at the 4/8 line.... It may move to the next octave....( 4/8 to 8/8)......so if she powers passed the 4/8 line lock in the profit and let her run... Glenn

--- 帖子 #832 ---
The Eur/Usd chart is a zero bounce.....be carefull no momentum can go any where...... but with the stoch in overbought area......more likely to fall.........but its a no trade... Glenn

--- 帖子 #833 ---
I must add.....my charts are my view and only a guide,,,, please make your own trade's....based on your charts/indicators....If you wish to use some of the indicators I post then please try them on a DEMO Account untill you learn how to trade with them.. Do Not take my charts as a trade signal... Glenn

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Hi Glenn, Wow!! So much information to absorb. But, what do you mean by "Zero bounce?" Also, when you say "no momentum," are you basing that on the AC indicator being near the zero line? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I have never traded this pair but the setup was there and here is what it looked like. I'm including my preferred template on the left and one similar to Glenn's on the right. I realize Glenn, that your template is used by you on longer time frames. I'm thinking it works pretty well on M5 also. Stoch below 50 and heading down nicely, macd confirmed a bit later and absolute strength was negative. And the price action (candle patterns) were saying sell. Original target was 4/8 and I just removed my profit target in time as it seems to have more downside. SMI turned but never went above zero....and then turned back down. Would have exited if it went much above zero as that seems to be the key level for this indicator. I'm living in the wrong time zone for this...Asian session in 1am eastern has loads of tradeable patterns. Happy trading. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi Guys. k2kvHi Glenn, Wow!! So much information to absorb. But, what do you mean by "Zero bounce?" Also, when you say "no momentum," are you basing that on the AC indicator being near the zero line? Yes zero bounce is when the pair come to the zero line and do not cross but theres not to much momentum to take it back the way it came.... add the stoch is in over bought area...... CanuckCT using the indicators on a 5min may give a lot of false entries/ exits.....with the AB strenght you need to wait for it to turn up and split into the dotted line and the solid line, the bigger the seperation the stronger the move and the sharper the angle up the stronger the move..... with the MM lines...you are on a small time frame so it will be common to see the pair go from 8/8 to 1/8....or the full range +2/8 to -2/8th....particularly during volatile times like Frankfurt/london opens... The best indicator to have on the 5 min would be the momentum indicator...and wait for it to cross the 50 line to enter. Glenn

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hi all, Took a very nice +60 pips this morning following Glenn's good advice regarding MM lines. I entered long GBPJPY after price had climbed above the 1/8 line (if I had been awake earlier I would have entered above the 0/8 line for double the fun). Set my TP to just below the 00 near the 2/8 line. So, basically, I traded a 1/8 move. 15/30/60/240 stochs all pointing up and climbing. Nice smooth move, very little heat. Still on demo with this method, but so far it's given me three great trades: +78, +36 yesterday, +60 today. Nice feeling (Thanks Glenn...). Hope everyone has a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Good to see ,,,,,Its a nice method when you get to know how to read the indicators... have a good weekend all.. Glenn

A quick question about MM... What are the timeframe settings you guys use for this indicator....is it set to "0" so that the current chart timeframe is reflected in the settings....or is it set to be specific to the 1H chart? Thanks, cl

Trade update...here is what it looks like now. I'm not liking the way the stochastic threads look. They didn't move like I had hoped they would. Was up +15 at the high, now +9. Stop moved to breakeven and profit target left as is. I may take my pips and close soon. Cheers, CanuckCT

Glenn, Very nice trading. I was sleeping at the london open, and most days I am, it's 4 in the morning here on the east coast of Canada. I drool at the moves at that time of day.

Hope this helps... trading this way is simply waiting for a breakout confirmed by A.S indicator and stoch/AO.....and then letting it run to the support/resistance MM lines.... With the G/j i have tried to show the early warning it gave us on the AO....so it was a matter of waiting for the move and confirmation from the other indicators... Glenn

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Thanks Glenn, this does help. I'll be looking more closely when I get home from work. Do you ever trade the asian session or do you prefer the london session? I can usually stay up for the first couple of hours of the london session, I'm wondering if I should even bother with the asian session since there's so little volume in comparison.

The only time I will look at the Tokoyo session would be if the DOW finished well down or up and therefore there maybe some movement when the Nikki opens.... other then that I stay away from that market, same as I stay out of Friday NY trading... Glenn

CanuckCT - PipAV8tor, Did you guys have any trades today based on the 5 min. scalp? T4K

--- 帖子 #851 ---
One trade today - EURUSD, +15. Not a M5 scalp. H1 timeframe trade that just didn't go anywhere. Better than a negative day. Looking back, there were many better trades today than the one I took. Anyone else take any M5 scalps? Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #852 ---
here was the setup at the open.. i got the confirmation on the 1H and 15min... i entered late at 1.9544 ( i just walked in from work)....rode down about a 9 pip drawdown before it took off.... out at 1.9559 ( figured it would reverse at the 1/8 at 1.9560 or so) and it did.... Thanks for the MM....it's a great tool.. cl

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Possible setups..... Its 02.43 GMT..... ( wait till after UK news....) watch G/u for break up to 3/8th line.... needs to close and open new candle..(15min will do)...above 1.9588 to confirm.... You can see the setup on the chart below..... Watch U/J for break down to at least 3/8th.....( she may fall below) but as the pair is revisting earlier lows I would watch for a bounce of the 3/8th line... needs to close and open new candle..below..107.69 to confirm... You can see the setup below... hope this helps to show how it works... Always wait for confirmation from your indicators.. Glenn If I get chance I will try to update these charts..

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Update on the U/J....it has retrcated to the 1hr 5sma....we shall see now if it turns or where it will contiune to move up towards the 4hr 5sma... Glenn..

New candle in 20 mins......This pair may move shortly....the GU news maybe already factured into this pair and they are starting the move... Watch... Glenn

--- 帖子 #856 ---
with low volume and the pending GBP news it looks like it will now stall till later..... U/J appears to want to bounce of the 4/8th line and may retrace back to the 5 sma (1hr).... Glenn

--- 帖子 #857 ---
As you can see the U/J hit the 4/8ths line........and then bounced...so we wait for another setup... hope you made some thing out of it...I only took 45 pips...

Hi Ocelot. Can you post any examples? Have you previously had consistent success with this method?

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Well I had a good couple of weeks including a stretch of 9 winners in a row. This week though, the GBPJPY has started to trend and I've been getting in too early, too eager to trade, and going against the trend. Just need to relax and focus on the good setups. And of course, to vent. =)

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Yes it happens. You did a great job of answering your own question! So much easier than taking advice from someone else...

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Good morning all. Ocelot, i completley understand what you are saying. Sometimes you just get eager and want to be "in the game". I have a quick question for the board.....yesterday i took the GBP trade at the asian open and got out at the 1/8 ( i live in illinois, and work during the day...)....i can see that it has continued to keep going up, now sitting at 5/8....how do you guys interpret the MM lines and would that have kept you into the GBP trade longer? Thanks in advance, cl

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Hi Ocelot, If it's any consolation, I also got killed yesterday. My own fault, of course (I mean, who else would be responsible??). I took what looked like a good GBPJPY short, watched it zoom up around -32 and exited, only to have it come back down again. Would have given me at least +30 if I had remained. Ironically, my original SL was set to -50, but the rapid drawdown made me pull the plug. Two hours later I did the exact same thing. Exactly the same. Can you imagine? So, I must have entered too early both times. I always expect some retracing, but when it zooms away like that the moment I enter, I get scared off. If I look back for a month or so I can safely say that, had I not given in to retracement fear, nearly all of my bad trades would have been profitable. So, I guess I need to enter a bit later (after the retrace?) and -- more importantly -- learn to tolerate the zooming downdraw that seems inevitable with GBPJPY. Nearly all of my bad trades have been caused by fear. Most of my bad trades would have gone positive if I had just waited them out. So, I seem to be able to recognize a good setup, but need to relax and let the trades work themselves out. Anyhow, don't be too hard on yourself. We all have much to learn, and sometimes our lessons can be a bit harsh. Trade with smaller lots or minis, until you regain your confidence. Venting is healthy. Thanks for sharing with us!

current trades.... G/J short.... look to 209.30 tp as its the 0/8 th line 1hr and the 3/8th line on the 4hr.....when it doubles like that it will be stronger resistance.. u/J short ..should re test the pervious lows....and I belive it may move down to 106.00 over the day....possible more likely during or after London opening with the added volume... Also added the other indicators ...just to show how they look on a live chart.. Glenn

Hey guys, Since I seem to have trouble posting charts here, if you would like to see 2 trades that I was in today, with some notes, email me and I will send you a screen shot in word format. They are 5 min trades and were both taken in low volume time. 1 was for 18 pips around 1 pm CST and the other for 10 pips at 5 pm CST. There were many other ops but that was the only times I was watching. In fact a nice buy opportunity just occurred abuut 30 minutes ago but I was putting my notes on the screen shot so I missed that too.

GBPUSD +35 , USDCHF + 20 on a short tonight..... hope you guys had great trades. cl

--- 帖子 #870 ---
I admire those folks who can spot the trades on the higher time frames. I try but I'm not always able to watch the market. So I end up trading when I can. Here are my trades for late tonight. GU +40, GC +30, GJ +10, +40,+20. Total +140. AU currently +10...entered on retrace. (closed at +7), total +147. This M5 system needs a name, so I'll call it the "Canuck Scalp". I take no credit whatsoever as it was cobbled together as follows: 5-3-3 from spud MACD 5-13-1 from that famous H4 MACD thread - worth the read Absolute strength indicator from Glenn (you almost could trade just using this indicator) Thanks to all of them. The rules for entry are as follows: M5 stochastic 5-3-3 leads the way and must be above or below 50 MACD 5-13-1 must cross the zero line Absolute strength must also be in agreement The rules for exit - take your profits when they appear and don't get greedy. There will be many many M5 opportunities. If the trade isn't going your way within 5 to 10 minutes, you might consider exiting and waiting for the next opportunities. These 3 indicators, when in agreement, have me on a string of winners. I try to implement other people's systems with mixed results. This is the only system that seems to works consistently for me. So I've zipped the indicators and the template - hopefully others will see what I see in the trades. I'd be interested in any feedback. Cheers, CanuckCT

The MTFS system(s) work a lot better (for me) during ranging markets. Has anyone had good success trading MTFS during trending markets? I read Spud's elasticity overview, he makes it sound so easy...

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Hello Jeff, May I join the "Got Burned Club"? These setbacks should be view as the cost of tuition when we decided to enroll at Forex University. I do agree with you that a good antidote for the fear we experience is to trade an amount that allows high volatile pairs to bounce around until our set up comes to fruition. My biggest losses come when I keep a trade open which I am eventually forced to close because my money management was inadequate. It seems to me that with the gbp/jpy pair, especially if we are trading short time frames, one needs to be very disciplined or have deep pockets to withstand the drawdowns. In my case, I posses neither and in the Forex market this can be lethal. If I can not learn "when to hold them,when to fold them...you have to know when to walk away and know when to run...", then I will never meet my goal. I am still determined to find a way to domesticate my unruly tendencies.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
A couple of responses... Canuck- I think your system looks great. Something i've tried to do before i take a trade (straight out of spud's playbook) is get a confirmation on 2 time frames. I personally "feel" much more comfortable taking those trades. Typically i use the 1H/15Min. I think your use of the MACD on the 5 helps me to look at a problem i have been having - which is getting out of a trade too early. AFter entering on the 15, i have a tendancy not to watch the 1H for the longer term trend. Sometimes i'll just go back to the 15, see a reverse, and panic and capture my gains. AFter work i plan on experimenting with your system because i think it has a lot of promise and is just so simple. Thanks for sharing. Ocelot - I pretty much agree with you about ranging markets. The problem i have with the trending markets is wanting to enter against the trend. It seems like when a market is falling, it's real easy for the stochastics to coil into the "rod" we are using to seeing on these pics. You get the signal to enter, then after 20 pips in your direction, the bottom falls out again( obviously an exageration, but i'm sure you know what i mean). I've tried to incorporate a longer term stochastic on my chart ( 4H, or day) and that has helped me to stay with the trend more. I think the absolute strength indicator has been a big help in terms of finding those points of reversal. take care, cl

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Those are the exactly the kind of trades I was losing on this past week. I'd gotten accustomed to ignoring the 4hr stochastic and just relying on the 15m, 30m, and 1hr in order to get quicker, and more numerous signals. However, if you do that in a trending market what I'm discovering often happens is that by the time you get a signal, you're at the end of a retrace and the trend begins to resume -- against you. All of my bad trades could have been avoided by following the original rules and not taking any long trades while the 4hr was under 20. Since the yen-based pairs have been in a strong down trend this week I thought for fun I would ignore the stochs completely and just short everything (in a demo account of course). I did this last night and got +50, +50, and +100 on the AUDJPY, EURJPY, and GBPJPY respectively. A veteran trader I know once told me "A trend will often go further, and longer than we think it will", so that was my logic going in. =) This morning I see the 4hr is back above 20 on the GBPJPY so perhaps we're getting back to a ranging environment. Lesson learned - pay attention to the 4hr stochastic. Happy trading everyone.

Nice work Marcin. Were you tempted to take a long trade on that move up right before your short trade? I know I would have. Been tempted that is. =)

--- 帖子 #880 ---
About 90 minutes ago I went into a meeting. When I came out here is what I missed.... A 100+ pip move according to entries of M5 Canuck Scalp system - not really scalping, so I guess I need a different name. I've added a 5-3-3 and a 14-3-3 stoch. The 5-3-3 is out ahead. If 14-3-3 follows, that's extra confirmation of the move. If it doesn't follow, a retrace is in play. In this trade both stochs already above 80. That doesn't seem to be an issue, you just have to be watching for the 5-3-3 to move. Cheers CanuckCT

Ocelot I did not think about taking it long.the reason is that the 4H was very low at the time the other stochs were moving up.When trading 1H/30M/15M agreement trade with 4H being below 20 line I want the 4H to give direction confirmation.So the 4H suppose to be pointing up slightly and be near 20. another thing is the 1H/30/15M have to definitely crossed 20 line up and be tight together and be closed at the moment of entry.this criteria were not meet so I did not took long trade.

Three trades to discuss. First GJ trade entered right at 211. This was not smart...at least I should have waited for some evidence that price would break 211. MACD had crossed, stochs were down and AS was negative. Exited at BE. Second trade was another short, same setup. Waited for price to close below 211 for a few candles and entered at 210.89. Was looking for 210, closed for +43. AU - entered on the break of .88, stochs were up, MACD had crossed and AS was positive. Price didn't go up. Closed for -11. Cheers, CanuckCT

Last post for a while. Just too darn busy! Thanks to all the folks here who have helped me. I feel like I'm finally on track. GJ sell...stochs below 50, macd crossed zero and AS confirmed. +35 pips. Cheers CanuckCT

I am having trouble opening and saving the files in Canuck Scalp Zip file . I can open the zip file but I can't save them. Can you post your files individually on this thread along with your template? Many thanks, T4K Please disregard this request. I called my son at college and he told me what to do. Thank goodness for smart children!!

Here's a trade I took this evening for +80 pips. I was late getting in and the 15 and 30 were already overbought. I still took it though because there was a nice steep slope on the 1h which still had plenty of room to move up, and the 4h was above 50 and moving up. Okay, back to studying...

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Going back to Spudfyre's original writings, on GY I'm going to need a stop loss of at least 5X the 10+ or 20+ pips I am looking for unless I get the entry perfect. I have noticed I don't want to enter a trade on a pullback. It's completely counter-intuitive. Given that the H4 and H1 and M30 are in place the M15 trade has a high probability. Too many times I have entered when a trade has started to go my way, watched it eat up the spread, very nice thank you, go into profit a little, very nice again thank you, and then slap me across the face by pulling back. This is psychologically damaging. If I ride it out, which I have done many times, I think I've been lucky to get a result. The pullback is exactly where I should be entering.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Smikester I know exactly what you're talking about as I've noticed the same thing. This is where comparing the 15m to the 30m and 1h can be helpful. If there is a pullback and the 15m starts to turn over but the 30m is unaffected you can wait for the 15m to reverse back to it's original direction and enter there or just hold your position if you're already in. Sometimes a pullback will affect both the 15m and 30m but not the 1h but the concept is the same, as long as the 1h keeps going in the same direction, enter when the 15m reverses back to it's original position also. The trick is figuring out when it's just a pullback and when it's a real reversal. In fact, this is the trick of trading period. =) I've not solved this problem but one thing I like to look for is if a pullback is occurring at an area of previous resistance. If so, I might be more inclined to move my stop to break even or just get out. if a pullback is occurring in the midst of an uptrend and the longer term stochastics are holding their direction, then I'd be more inclined to hold my position, and perhaps even add to it. Hope that helps...

Tim, I've decided to start my own thread related to this method and on Jeff's sggestion, it's now called "X50". You can find the template and indicators here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=65703 Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #889 ---
It seems to me that most systems manage to do ok in a ranging market. MTF Stochastics however is not meant to help you in either range or trend markets. It has proved most useful to me when I decide going into the trade that I will at least go for 20 to 50 pips. MTF Stochs shows me when to get in. Getting out takes discipline. You are much better off aiming for 20-30 pips each time then trying to ride a trend wave. The wave could go with you, but then again it could go against you. Success is found in a long series of small, profitable steps. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Hey smikester, here's an example of entering on a pullback that I took last night. Notice at my entry point the 15m is headed back up, I went short anyway because as you can see the 30m and 1h were both unaffected and showing good downward movement. I took 20 pips out of this trade.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Hi kudzu, Thanks for posting your thoughts. Spud's original rules for his escalator system (which is the one I find to work better during a ranging market) is that you let the movement of the stochastics determine your profits. Get out when the 15m, 30m, or 1h reach overbought/sold levels. The same concept holds true for his elastic/rubber band system. However, doing so requires constant monitoring of your position which I can't always do. Like you, I'd prefer to go for set profit targets, right now I'm trying for only 20 per trade on the GBPJPY. The exceptions being when I'm targeting a swing high or low, or following Spud's original exit rules by closely monitoring the stochs. Following my post above, I'd gotten my head back in the game and ended the week with two profitable trades.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Good trade, Ocelot and thank you for posting that example. As long as I can get used to entering on pull backs, or at least expecting them, I think I can gain more confidence. The other thing is this. I hate to lose a trade. I take it too personally. Now if I had 10 losers in a row maybe that is how I should feel. But I need to get that detached view. I would question your quote of Spudfyre "Get out when the 15m, 30m, or 1h reach overbought/sold levels". What he did say was: When the 15 gets below 20 (or latterly 23.6) that is where the pips are made - and my studies show this to be correct - and that you should get out when the 15 is leaving that area but definitely when the 30 is.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Definitely don't take it personally, I've fallen into that trap myself and that's when serious damage to your account can happen, revenge trading, etc. I do my best to "get over" every trade after it's closed, winner or loser, and move on to the next one. The beauty of this example is that I got in at exactly the right time and essentially had no drawdown. Hopefully it wasn't just luck. =) With regards to Spud's rules, yes, you're right, once a pair goes overbought/sold you can leave it open for more pips which you'd definitely get in a strong continuation move. The pullback trade above would have given an additional 50-60 pips had I left the trade on while waiting for the 15m to come back out of oversold. However, my main goal right now is for consistent small profits, and as little time time spent in front of the trading screen as possible so I'm happy to walk away with 20 pips. =) That's another great thing about this system, multiple exit strategies!

Yeah, I think you're right. The turtle wins the race.

All of the sudden, everyone is gone. Have we lost our faith in STOCHS?? Here is a trade I took earlier today. Very simple trade off of the 5 min chart. Larger time frames were in agreement. Primary indicator; the 14,3,3, and 5,3,3 stochs. Not sure why anyone one needs more than this... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Hi Pip, Yes, I believe most are playing around with X50, the new holy grail. I, too, am spending time with it, and that's why I haven't been active here the last week or two. Also, I've been trying to shake a rather tenacious losing streak, so I tend not to post when I'm in that mode. Fortunately, I think I shook that bad spell today! As you know, folks will go wherever they feel most comfortable and where they think they can find the most success. And -- that's how it should be. I think that in Forex, it's the destination that really counts, not so much the journey. We've had a very successful thread here and -- if and when folks return -- if they want to post their MTFS trades or ideas, everyone is more than welcome. Just remember that our loyalty must always be to the pips, not the method. I'm still hanging around, and I still utilize MTFS when the opportunity presents. Take care...

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Hey Stoch lovers, I hope you guys that trade basic MTF stochs- keep it up - you will find it worth your while. IMO -the only way you will get ahead is to stick to one system, you need to know and own it! Each time you change it you ,you go back two steps. Jarret

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Yep, yep, Stoch lovers please keep this thread alive. Below is my premature chart and the last profitable trade. I'm kind of lazy switching to different timeframe so I put hr, 4hr, daily and weekly stoch all in one page

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Well fellow stoch lovers, I will keep posting and I do believe that you go with "the one that brung ya", so I don't see myself changing any time soon. I like trading the 5 min, especially with the gbp/jpy and I am convinced you don't need anything other than the stoch's to do it. It is 10-15 pips (at least) every time I trade it and I can make that trade at least 6 times a day. why would I need anything else? Keep on Stochin'!!!!!

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Hi Jackt, Very nice trading! I like your approach to the single chart. Obviously all stochs were in your favor. I wonder if you wouldn't mind sharing your stoch settings with us. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Hi Pip, Picking up 10-15 pips 6 times a day is a good thing, especially on GBPJPY. But GBPJPY is so volatile and jittery, especially on the 5-min charts (I know, I've played there myself). Do you use the same setup for all of those trades and, if so, can you share with us your entry strategy, how you handle the drawdown, and how you make a swift and profitable exit? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Jeff, I really do use a VERY simple setup. I use the 5,3,3 stoch and the 14,3,3 on the 5 min chart with the mac-d as confirmation. I trade the move of the 5,3,3 as it "bounces" between the 20/80 lines. I trade in the direction that the 14,3,3 is pointed on the 15 m chart. Never against. It always helps if the 1 hr and 4 hr agree, but not required. The strength of the move is gauged by the mac-d. Could be a 2-3 min trade or I might stay for 20-30 minutes and pick up 30-40 pips. The move of the 5,3,3 on the 5 min must have crossed either the 80 or the 20, in fact , you could use a 70/30 touch as a real trigger for a safer trade. The best scenario is for the 14,3,3 on the 15m to be in between the 80/20 and in the same direction. I am not sure that multiple stochs in the same window gives the same feel. I have 2 separate charts open and use them both. A 14,3,3 on the 5 does not equal a 14,3,3 on the 15 for a directional purpose. Very separate indicators, IMHO. Hope this helps. P.S. It can be done in low volume times. Consolidation actually provides some very predictable moves, as price will bounce for several hours in the same range.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Sure! the settings. All stoch are set to close/close, linear weighted. hr - 14,3,3, 23,3,3 hr - 20,10,10, 30,10,10, 50,10,10 (simulating 4h 5,3,3, 14,3,3, 23,3,3). mtf stoch daily - 5,3,3, 14,3,3, 23,3,3 weekly - 5,3,3, 14,3,3, 23,3,3 I modified the mtf stoch to coincide with the current price bar. It didn't work very well. Guess I'm no programmer

--- 帖子 #904 ---
....and still trading MTF stochastics. I had a great week last week and will keep posting charts if people are interested.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Hey Pip. Thanks for your explanation. I agree about using separate windows for each stoch. In one of my setups, I have four separate windows, each for a different TF, each with only one stoch. Gives me much greater clarity, and I recommend others try the same to see if they like it better than a single window-for-all-stochs approach. Your setup is very similar to Canuck's, except that he waits for the 533 to cross the 50 level, and also utilizes the absolute strength indicator (in addition to MACD) for confirmation. Often, that setup does not give an entry signal until the stoch has crossed into the 80-100 zone. I'll be on demo this week, so I'll try to compare success between the two approaches if I can. I think trading M5 should be fairly easy. The biggest problem I've had is tolerating the jumpy price movements (noise), back and forth during a quick trade while hoping price will move in my favor. I scare easily and often exit before I've given my trade time to develop. I will be concentrating on resolving that issue this week. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Hi Jack, Thanks for sharing your settings. I'm curious as to why you use close/close, when most of us are using lo/hi. I use close/close in the boxingforlife sexy setup, but not for basic Spud MTFS. Much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Yes, please do. We're not nearly done here Thanks!

--- 帖子 #908 ---
close/close give a bigger swing. more eye catching. often 14,3,3 pull back to 80/90/100 (20/10/0). i'm more comfortable with elasticity than rope.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
my current trade... price found support at 365sma (white), hr, 4hr stoch turning up.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Here was a short I took tonight, the 4hr looks like it's pointed up but when I took the trade the unclosed portion was actually pointing down. The 15m and 30m were already oversold but I liked the strong move down by the 1hr and as I said the unclosed 4hr was also pointing down. +80 pips. Rock.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Ocelot, Thanks for posting ur trade. One thing that caught my eye was that u r using 9,3,3 for ur stochs. How did u arrive at that? I see so many ppl using different values for the stochs, it is becoming a bit hard to figure out which one is the best combinations. Appreciate a bit of insight. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Ocelot &amp; Jackt, Nice trading guys! Clearly good stochastics pointing the way. Yes, I'm also wondering about the 9.3.3 settings...

--- 帖子 #913 ---
9,3,3 - my favorite. Here's how I got there. I've tested and traded tons of systems, quite a few stochastic-based. A system I traded years ago used the 9,3,3 settings and I had developed a 'feeling' of how it behaved with certain currency pairs. A while back on Spud's thread there was some debate on whether to use 5,3,3 or 14,3,3. Having tested both I found myself not liking the noise the 5,3,3 on the 15m produced, neither did I like the fewer signals and lag of the 14,3,3 settings. Then I remembered my old system that used 9,3,3 (note that it's basically halfway between 5 and 14) and decided to test it out. For me it works well, I get less noise than on the 5 and more frequent signals than the 14.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Great thread, I have two questions. For those of you who trade when all the stochs line up and enter for small amount of pips as spudfrye had mentioned in his thread ( when 20 pips lock 7, when 35 lock in 15etc.) what stoploss do you set. Cause I been giving it some thought but I would think an ex. 100 pip stoploss would wipe out a long winning streak with just one or two stoplosses getting hit. I just want to know how those that trade that way manage. And my second question is does everyone wait for the candle on the timeframe they are watching to close before entering or as soon as the stochs line up enter. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
hi nelson, I use a couple of different strategies for stop losses and profit targets. For stops, I like to put them above/below recent areas of support and resistance. For profit targets I go for either a set number of pips, a target of a recent high or low, or, in the case of GBPJPY in particular, a double zero level. My most recent trade posted above, is an example of where I targeted a double zero level. Despite these strategies though, I will still monitor my open trades and if the stochs start going against me, I'll get out, usually way before my stop loss is hit. Usually my risk/reward ratio is terrible, but, given how reliable this system is it doesn't really matter. It's good to start off going for small numbers of pips until you get a feeling for how the pair(s) you're trading moves. You could also try using the ATR to determine profit targets and stop losses. Another thing to keep in mind, you don't need to capture a whole move start to finish (in fact that's nearly impossible) but only a portion of the move. Small consistent profits will add up over time. If a pair moves 120 pips but you only capture 20, that's still +20 pips in the bank. As for waiting for a candle to close, I sometimes do, and sometimes don't. I'm more apt to wait for a 15m to close than I am the 1hr, but it really gets back to 'feeling'. Once you've started developing a feeling for how a pair moves you'll get a sense as to whether you need to wait for a candle to close or not. Go back and read the posts about entering on pullbacks as it's somewhat related to this.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Thanks for replying so fast. I just thought that having a bad risk to reward, one stoploss being hit would wipe your profits off. ex. 5 wins 20 pips per win 1 loss 100 pips, back to even. What I have been doing is waiting for the close of the candle at support/ resistance and then entering looking at mtf stochastics but it seems to not let me see as great of a picture of stochastics as if you wait longer. For the stochs to take there shape. Do you wait for candles to close to enter.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Hello ocelot, Thanks for the 9,3,3 settings. It looks good on 1hr tf. Me too give up on 5,3,3. Just too much noise.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
If you only ever traded for 20 pips yes, that could certainly happen. The other exit strategy I didn't mention in my last post, and that Spud talked about, was once a pair goes overbought/oversold, let the trade ride until it comes out of that overbought/oversold state. You can catch huge moves like that upwards of 200+ pips on volatile pairs like the GBPJPY. Get a few of those, and that should cover any big losses you might incur. I sometimes wait for candles to close to enter, it really depends on the position of the stochastics.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Not much movement tonight, but I squeezed +16 pips out of this one. The last thing I was waiting on here was for the 30m to turn down, all the other stochs were already pointing down. You can see the next candle after my entry was bullish and would have been a good place to enter on the pullback.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Hi I was hurt very badly yesterday.look at the chart GJ,it was nice long entry signal and after I entered the price wnet down very quickly.Now I susupect it was because of reduction of interest rate in USA ,but I didnt see any annoucement in the schedule.

Sorry you got burned Marcin, that sucks! Here are two rules for you to follow from now on - 1. Check this at the beginning of every week. http://forexfactory.com/calendar.php 2. NEVER EVER trade on the day of an interest rate decision, or the non-farms payroll report. =)

I wanted to know if anyone knew how much spudfrye or anyone risk on a single trade whether it be 2% or any other number. My reason for asking is I am torn between trading and trying to capture a certain percent over my risk, such as ratio of 1:2 or exit such as spudfrye does and at 20pips profit set stoploss to 7 and at 35 set stoploss to 14 etc. If anyone using these two ways of money management could give there insight. In analyzing the latter I feel that if someone risked ex. 2% being 80 pips and only aimed for 20 pips a day by the end of the week considering everyday they obtained the 20 pips, they would only have increased there account by 2.25% for the week. Not that this isn't an accomplishment, cause I'm still trying to be that consistent but I wanted to know if this is the thinking behind it.

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Nelson, For the record, I don't frankly believe in the commonly accepted risk:reward method of setting my SL. It seems a rather illogical way to locate a safe price point. Instead, I set my SL at some point on the other side of pivots, support, resistance, highest recent candle, etc., where I feel it is not likely to be hit (and if it is, then I definitely want out), or at some price where I simply feel I would no longer want to be in the trade. I set my TP to a price that I feel is realistic and will be easily accomplished, and often jump out earlier, if retracement occurs while I am in profit. Often, my TP is much smaller than my SL. I generally keep my risk to a maximum of 2% of my account per trade, so if my SL must be placed behind a pivot that is very far away, I will lower my lot size in order to accommodate the amount of money I am willing to risk on that trade. In other words, if my account is, say, $10,000, I will only risk $200 max. If I have to place my SL 100 pips away from my entry, I can only play for $2 per pip, or two minilots. If my SL is placed 20 pips away, then I can play for $10 per pip, or one full lot (10 minilots). For me, SL has no relationship to TP. One is for safety (or the limit of my tolerance), the other is for profit. I am unable to relate the two. They do not need to correlate in any way, as far as I'm concerned. Use caution, don't follow blindly what others do; find your own comfort zone, and keep your risk low enough that you will survive a big losing streak if you have to. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
K2KV, I also agree with setting the sl at support/resistance and risking 2% on each trade no matter how many pips away the sl is from entry. The only part I cant seem to get over is if we don't try to capture lets say at least a 1:1 ratio then our system would have to produce many wins compared to losses as one loss would wipe out our previous profits. ex. risk profit %profit trade 1 80 8 .20% trade2 40 20 1% trade 3 60 0 -2% trade 4 50 50 2% trade 5 50 10 .40% trade 6 30 0 -2% trade 7 50 10 .40% 0% increase of account. In other words if system is highy correct then hi risk/lo reward mm ok. But if reward is not allowed to run then winners may not cover losers. I am only demo trading now until I can be consistent. How are you trading stochastics right now and are you able to have consistent wins? Thanks. Just throwing these thoughts around and any advice is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Nelson, Yes, that is correct. My goal is to have many more wins than losses To answer your questions, I trade a variety of methods, including mtf stochs, and am still in the learning/exploring stages. I usually trade a real account but, since I've recently experienced a string of losses, I've gone back to demo for two weeks, in order to work out my issues. Good trading to you...

--- 帖子 #935 ---
I agree the common way of setting a Stop loss is to use pivots or support/resistance and of course trendlines, if however you are on a longer time frame and a pivot is a long way of and you feel uncomfortable with the trade reaching that pivot you can calculate the Average Daily Range and set your Stop loss at half of the figure, this will also work for setting targets...You would open two lots with the first target at 50% of the ADR and the second with a SL at 50% and the target at 100% of the ADR..

Heres my 10 pips for the day, took 2 trades, one on the GBPJPY and USDJPY. Here's the USDJPY, the first oval entered and second oval TP of 10 pips, on demo. Could have gone for more, 20/25 pips, but was happy with 10pips! I am now getting the hang of this system. 5min stoch going up 15min stoch turned up 30 min stoch flat at the time 60 min stoch going up i will try and post my 10 pips a day, starting today. regards, guess

As we speak... great setup and +3pips... this has steam and should go some... but I am in for a good 10 pips... was in middle of something... and now it has hit tp of 10pips... around 40pips for the day... not too bad... standard lots, would have been £400... now that would have been nice! But am still getting to grips with the system, gave up on it a while ago, but getting the hang off it... don't force trades, let the trades come to you. regards, guess

that is my first real perfect classic escalator . I gained 18 pips in just a couple of minutes.the move noe is abot 50 pips. I entered when at the beginning of new 15 minutes candle and exited when price reached pivot line.It was at the time 4h candle close.there was a nice engufling line on 15m chart and perfect engufling bar on 30m chart As you see all 4 stoch were closed above 20 line.It looked perfect . I have never won so easily and so safety.

Here's a great setup... There is room for more I feel, though 5 pips for this time of the day is fine with me, I am +2 pips at the moment, but have a TP of +5 pips, no SL, I think it will hit.

hi Look at the euro /usd now . you can wait a couple of minutes to 30 m bar closed and anter short if nothing change. For me it is going to be move down as 1H/30/15m stochs would join the 4H being below 20. Daily at our favour is pointing down

i think a really nice setup might be brewing for GJ. 4 hour stoch pointing down and the other 3 are in overbought.. unfortunately, i am leaving for the gym soon. and this is not the best time to trade anyway...

--- 帖子 #947 ---
look at aj .it is going to be perfect clasic escalator as the 4 h first crfossed 80 down,it is safer to wait 20 minutes to 1h close,it looks so nice,it will be strong move,additionaly it is time of london open

--- 帖子 #948 ---
My exitement went away as the stochs did not manage to close below 80 line. Anyway it is lesson that is better to wait for the 1H to close even when the situation look so attempting as in this example

--- 帖子 #949 ---
my today trade on gu for +20 pips.. It is a good example of trading 1h/30/15M into 4h.although the 4H was below 80 line it was flat and the other stoch crossed 20 up and were pointing up nicely. nice setups.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
I would like to share with you my obsrevation about trading time. It is probably not new what I say now but keeping that in mind may keep you out of bad trades. It is timing of trades.I found out that the market is best trading right after sessions open especially after london open and that is the time your mtf stochastics trades will have better chance of being successful ones. I observed that on GU. Many times after frankfurt open the price move 20-30 pips in one direction and after london open one hour later at 8GMT,the price moved in opposite direction.So when stochs indicate entry at that time that can be additional confirmation that the price will nicely move in your direction. that is just my thouht. I wonder if anybody have similar experience. On the other hand I lost many trades when trading after london close,so now I do not trade after 17GMT and it seems it improved my results significantly. Just analyse the price movement throughout 24 hours and you wiil see what i mean.

EU trade for 10 pips. It is cheating a litille as I entered before 1H closed.Anyway It was only 10 minutes to bar close.I do not sugest to do that unless it is realy a couple of minuted to bar close and you have some experience. If I waited to bar close my score would be the same so in this example it was not matter.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
hi I am out with 10 pips on aj but look at this chart,thery is still chance to go short up to you,I am already out

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Hi, Thanx 4 sharing your trades....very interesting- I found out this thread and others from Spudfyre about stochastic strategies and I'm reading about since a couple of weeks...i got a bit confused at the moment. I think that there are at least 3 different styles of trading inside the stoch strategy cominf from Spudfyre...could you help me to clarify my ideas? More over i cant understand why such a nice thread like this one looks like almost abandoned right now.. Well thanx in advance 4 your answers and...plenty of pips to you!! Bye Franco

Corvogrigio Earlier in the thread we pointed out what are the main entry signals according to mtf sochastics trading. I suggest to read whole original thread by Spud an then read this thread.If yuo think about trading mtf stochs seriously just read it. Basicly we are looking situation when all 4 stoch : 4H, 1H, 30 M and 15 M are pointing in one direction.It would be perfect when all of them just cross 20/80.That is clasic escalator to pip strategy. You can trade 1H/30M/15M but this is more risky. When 4H is above /below 80/20 we trade 1h/30/15M ruberband trade into 4H. We can trade ruberband in many ways: 15/30M into 1H, 1H/30 M into 4H. You can also trade 1H/30M/15M away tarde(4H above 80 line,below 20line).Do not trade against 4H, if trading 1H/30/15M do not trade against daily stochs. for the beginner I suggest to pick up 1-3 pairs and trade only clasic trades.with time you will get the feeling and you will knew what are the best stochastics position-your favourite ones. Good luck

--- 帖子 #955 ---
you will have problem to find better entry stochastic position 1H/30/15M into 4 h and it happen at the best time ,after the london open,very quick and easy 10 pips

--- 帖子 #957 ---
yep me too wonder why I'm still trying to identify good setup vs not so good setup. Good and early entry point. example sell after the pin bar or wait for stoch confirmation. I also starting to see some other Stoch pattern. example yesterday although the price close higher but all 3 daily Stoch close lower. This imply today is likely a down trend. jackt

--- 帖子 #958 ---
my today trade for 10 pips. It is again nice setup 1H/30/15 into 4 h ,it is very similar to my yestareday trade,just see the charts above

HeY MARCIN25 ty very much 4 ur answer...it gave me some light though i have 4 sure to go through the entire 3d from beginning...anyway it will be easier now..as english is not my 1st language. I just have another question and sorry if probably i could find my answer in the 3d but it urges to me... I mean: ok i got that 15/30/h1 stoch are supposed to hit the 4H stoch...so if 4H is at or under 20 and they are pointing down from the upper side and are all 3 under 80 level ...well it must be the perfect setup (4 shorting , opposite 4 longing) but what if 4H is half way? ranging between 30 and 70? can't we bet that the 3 lower time framed stochs will pierce it whereever they r coming from? Well that was my question...sorry 4 bothering again and 4 my english Thank u in advance 4 ur answer...good pips!!

--- 帖子 #960 ---
We want to trade in the direction of 4H stoch, so if 4H cross 80 down we are looking for possibility to go short,if 4H cross 20 up we are looking for poosibility to go long and the general rule says do not trade against 4H stoch. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #961 ---
hi stochsters, Here's the set-up I've been using recently with success. I tried just about every variation of spud's system and was always just left wondering whether a stochastic would continue or retrace. Or the Multiple time frames never lined up. Or there were so many confliciting signals I never entered any trades. Not really that much further forwards from a bare chart. Even the thread system kind of left me in limbo. Although visual, I just never felt secure enough about it to ever trade it live. I kept getting spooked by the price and the variations in the stoch as it grew. Even the famous Spud "rope" which looks like an amazing no-brainer for trade-entry wobbles all over the place while it's forming. So, then I tried the thread system on multiple time frames which helped quite a bit and I have all time frames from 1Min to Daily on the screen. As many people on this thread have noticed, you can see much better where the trend is going with the threads system on Multiple Time Frames, although Spud never really mentioned this (as far as I can remember). If I'm feeling really extravagant I'll even put the Weekly and Monthly charts on a second monitor. Of course they never move, but that's not the point. They serve to remind me of the journey the price has made to get where it is. And they often explain why the shorter time frame stochs don't act like you think they're going to. But a great improvement (IMHO) was made by adding Boxinglife's Long-Term sexy stochs over the top of each time frame. His excellent thread has all the details, but if you can't be bothered to read all 1,000 posts (shame on you) simply add these stochs to Spud's Thread System on each time frame: 20,10,20 50,10,20 100,20,30 Even though MTF Threads obviously give you the heads-up regarding longer term movement, having the Sexy Stochs overlaid really helps me keep track of the trend "energy" visually even if the price is stationary. One of the things I found about using the Sexy Stochs system on it's own was that it missed lots of great entries. Using both Spud's Threads and Sexy Stochs together allows me to see long term trends, see more elasticity and also get good entries on the "peaks" of Spud's "threads". With a bit of James 16's Price Action and a simple Bollinger Band we're all sorted! Anyway, I'm up 10 trades out of 12 today, so I thought I'd share the love. No-one talks about divergence between stochs on different time frames much. For me they're quite amazing. Perhaps I'll describe a little about what I see on another post. Three cheers to Spud and BoxingisLife. Stochs rock!! Happy trading.

Hi Elchoco, and welcome to our thread. I must apologize for being so quiet of late. I'm trying to work out some of my more serious trading issues, and it's just taking more time than I thought it would. So, that is my first priority and main point of focus right now; once I feel I've got my act together, I will renew my activity here in this thread. For now, I'd just like to comment that I like what you're doing here and would like to see where you're headed, especially since I am a long-time devotee of the sexy setup. I don't trade Spud's thread setup (just can't wrap my brain around it), but the thing I really like about the sexy setup is that is so totally simple to observe, with the single 5.3.3 (missing from your setup?) calling the entries. I like to jump between multiple time frames and when the trend is the same on more than one higher TF, I trade the 5.3.3 signal cross on a lower TF. Looking forward to hearing more about your divergence techniques...

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hi K2V2, Thanks for the welcome. The 5,3,3 from sexy stochs is replaced by the thread system of spud (the lowest time frame of which is 6,3,3 by the way). The thread gives me a visual indication of "focus" of energy for the price move. Probably sounds weird, but if the threads are bunched tight when they pass up from 20 (for a long) then i can be more sure it's going to be a strong move. Also, if ALL the threads meet below 20 before moving back up, then that too is an indication of strength, and I increase lot size accordingly. If only the fastest ones dip below 20, or perhaps don't even reach it before turining back, I either reduce position size or look at avoiding the trade altogether. It depends on what the higher time frames are saying. I hear what your saying about sexy's easy looking entries. I guess for me there were always too many conflicting signals on different time frames for me to feel secure. Not sure why but all the time frames in my current set-up seem to "connect" together to produce a unified whole, a 3 dimensional view of the market flow. I never felt that with sexy stochs alone. el choco

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Just got crushed, these damn stochs keep changing on me. It all looked "up" on the long term charts so i took the beginnings of a retrace on the 1 hr and 15m charts. However the retrace retraced!! and what looked like a decent setup transformed into a dreary looking wrong way trade. Note to self: "I always want to get in too early". I'm reading James16 thread. One thing that stood out was "trade the breakouts otherwise you'll get chewed up in the consolidation". The stochs offer all kinds of signals, but not all of them are in during good "trending mode". It would be good to filter out the consolidation trades. I guess for the first time in ages I had a few days of luxury to sit in front of the screen. After 8 hours of waiting impatience got the better of me! cheers

--- 帖子 #965 ---
El Choco, When you have conflicting signals that make you feel insecure, your feelings are correct -- you should stay out. But when you finally have agreement on several time frames, then -- and only then -- you should find your confidence and trade the setup. That is the beauty of the system, and a learned perspective. It's easy to say, "I don't like the system because there are too many conflicting signals," when, in fact, the system is clearly doing what it is supposed to by trying to keep you out of trouble. Sexy definitely will not give you every possible trade. No system will. But if you watch the setups on multiple time frames, and wait for them to concur, you will be rewarded with many, many good ones. Good trading...

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Hi K2V2, I guess what I meant was that there seemed to be so many opportunities for profit that I didn't take because of the conflicting signals on different time-frames. I wouldn't have minded if there was a messy period of consolidation that it saved me from entering All that notwithstanding, I stripped down the indicators to (merely) Multiple Bolinger Bands and the Spud "thread system" on 1 hour, 15 min, 5 min and 1 min and spent Friday afternoon scalping the tail of the NFP. Nice. I made about 5k on demo so moved over to live before the momentum and my confidence ran out and picked up about 600 euros. I'll try the stripped down version again on monday. I think I was making it all more difficult than it need be. (perennial habit) Hope you get yourself back in the game PDQ. Cheers for now. El Choco

I'm using Metatrader 4 and am looking for the template or whatever that everyone is using which places the 4h/1h/30m/15m stochs all in one window or some instructions on how to do so manually. Can someone help me?

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Hi I like this one! Trading MTF stoch is really nice after some practice. I made about 300-400 pips yesterday using "the rope" by spud. I just wonder why most of MTF-stoch threads seem to be dying.

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Hi Dan, Why not show us how you traded? A couple of detailed images with accompanying test illustrating what compelled you to enter/exit (and what we should be on the lookout for) would surely be worth a great deal to those of us who may not feel totally confident relying on stochastic signals, and would be very much appreciated by this group. 300-400 pips is pretty impressive; let's see how it's done! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Ok, here is my best trade from yesterday. It´s good for me to look at it a second time myself. I´m sorry i cannot insert the picture cause i dont know how but it is attached. I have to say, that i am not an expert on stochs but i am willing to learn and become an expert one day I have recently started experimenting with the rope but have been playing arround with other MTF methods for few months before, especially sexy stochs by boxingislife and read all of spud´s stuff. I simply watched gbp/jpy m15 chart and watched the stochs for a while. at the end of the 20:30 candle they were all close together looking like turning down. I entered 2 mins later at 20:47 when price began to fall. watching the rope going down the trade was up over 120 pips after only 30 minutes. unfortunately i didn´t close the trade by that time cause i wanted to ride it even further and wanted to wait for an exit signal (everthing demo only so it doesn´t hurt to test) still gettong 88 I know this amount of gained pips is a lot, but the market moved quite good yesterday, especially to the downside . I don´t think that this can be repeated day by day but i am gaining confidence in trading MTFstoch setups more and more. Spud said he´s going for 20 pips daily and in my opinion this is more than do-able with his approch. Im normaly getting 50 daily on average and i have just started to explore FX. Sorry for my english, hope everybody understands.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
here is another trade. The rope is not perfectly established but i entered at the open of 16:45 candle. Early exit because price failed to break through 2.0000 which might be a big phsycho-level. Therefore I closed the trade without an exit signal from stochs.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Yes, I am beginning to enjoy the Spud Stochastics (although I had a bad trade with them today). Dan, what hours do you look for trades?

--- 帖子 #973 ---
I don´t have fixed "trading hours" because of my day job. I usaually get home arround 15 GMT and am watching the charts from time to time for the rest of the day. Many good moves unfortunately already happend until i get to look for trades. There was a perfect rope yesterday on gbp/chf m5 at 19:35. I didn´t take the trade but have been in a bad one too after pulling the trigger to fast (close to be now). Just want to insert the picture for the look of this rope. All the stochastics look like "one" which is good.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
This was always going to be a good title for the thread and I am very grateful to k2kv for keeping the subject alive. I'm still trading MTF stochastics and still the original Spud system but because I was finding it a bit stressful to trade larger lots by this method I have changed things a bit to suit my own style of trading. I look at the daily stochastics and even the monthly. When I enter I expect a trade to last a day, or two, or more. Because I always check the mtf stochastics 15;30;60;240 I usually seem to get a fairly good entry and it helps with exits. Because I'm looking for bigger moves than a few pips I enter with smaller lots and can add to them if things start to go well and look as if they will continue. Also, I can break Spud's rules a bit and still enter when everything looks overbought/sold on the lower time frames. Also, with a graded entry and smaller lots the dreaded pullback is less of a worry. I tend to use a bit of knowledge I picked up from Phillip Nel's 4 hour strategy thread so I also look at MACD and RSI. The only original tip I can give here is that I hardly ever enter a trade when the MACD is hovering around zero levels. For example, on GBP/JPY, I set my MACD levels at 0.2 and -0.2 (this is for 5,13,1). This signifies a knot of moving averages and can lead to unexpected whipsaws. Usually, your trend lines and support and resistance areas, if you have drawn them, back this up. I am looking at price action a la James 16 thread and finding that helpful. It's clear from some of the more perspicacious posters there that I have a lot to learn. But I have found that even a little knowledge in that department is valuable. If I see a classic Spudfyre set up I still trade it, can't resist! But it's for smaller lots and when it suits me. Anyway, I seem to be getting luckier at the moment, and more consistently lucky, so I thought I'd post this. If it was of some interest I would post a few charts of recent trades good, bad and ugly. Hope it was of some interest...

Just a note, I've been playing around with the stoch settings for MTF. I use daily, 4 hr, 1 hr and 15 min. Using the sexy stoch approach with three lines on one chart I find that (15,x,12) better mirrors the (5,x,3) on the next higher time frame. (I never use %D). I also use (20,x,12) to give some sense of momentum on the slower stochs. I found the original settings gave too many conflicting signals, and now I can use a mixture of spuds "escalator" strategy together with the sexy stochs patterns. I'm still playing to get a best fit. Here's a pic. (note the three perfect sexy-stoch short entries)

--- 帖子 #976 ---
I've never read up on the "Sexy" thread, only been trading Spud's method. Is it better than the MTF or a variation of it? Which would you prefer?

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I'm still in the process of reading the whole thread, but I thought I'd post this demo example I just completed. This is a great method, and so versatile, judging by all the different styles I've seen on this thread so far. My thanks go to Spud and boxingislife for their invaluable instruction. Any comments or suggestions would be welcome. Cheers

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Hi eyevoltage, Welcome to MTF Stoch... My chart is similar to yours. Just that I'm trying to simulate higher tf Stoch with bigger Stoch setting (because I want to trade with pda which don't support custom indicator). Also I like to use 50/00 level. jackt

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Hi Jackt. I've been using the psych levels 50/00 as well, but when you add pivot lines and fibs, it can all get a bit confusing. I guess one has to decide which ones to work with and ditch the rest, so I use pivs and fibs. What's pda, by the way?

--- 帖子 #980 ---
pda stand for personal digital assistant or something like that. I use it during working hour. Actually it's a pda phone running on windows mobile 6 and mobile mt4. Still testing the idea. So far 5 trades on the pda phone. 3 win 1 lost 1 b/e. Not bad I think for looking at tiny 2.8" screen and got to make a decision within 2-3 mins. jackt

JackT, it's good to see you're still around and trading. I'll be coming back to this page daily and trying to communicate with others to see if anyone's around and wanting to get some dialogue going. By the way, my results for today are: usdjpy (short) -10 usdcad (long) +40 usdcad (short) +59 so a total of +89pips for the morning which was from 2:30AM CST until 11:30AM CST. It was hard getting up that early but it was worth it.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Yeah, I had a so-so week as well. My problem came in whenever I get impatient waiting on a setup so I try to fabricate one. At least I'm not surprised when it doesn't work out like it should...I have serious self-destructive behavior.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
heres an example for u guys i have a 20,10,10 on the 4h (mtf) i have a 5 3 3 4h mtf also and a 9 3 3 1h (current timeframe) the way i trade these is like this for a long trade 4h needs to be trending up or above 80 and the 5 needs to be trending up or above 80 also. the 5 here acts like a 20 on the 1h timeframe so rather than adding a 20 on teh current timeframe, we can just use teh 5 3 3 (4h mtf) all u do is wait for the 20 and the 5 on the 4h to trend up or be above 80 or if one trending up the other above 80 or whatever and pick the trades using the 9 3 3 stochastics. the chart will show everything should bring a clean 100-200 pips a week per pair. only take the perfect trades/best lookin ones im doin some private mentoring sessions 1 on 1 sort of thing. free of charge obviously so just post it in here if ur interested or all of u pm a certain person and he can keep editing a specific post so u dont clog the thread

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Hi Boxing, Nice to see you here, hope all is well back home! Thanks so much for generously offering your assistance here. Anyone interested should please feel free to post as you wish. You will not clog the thread, as long as you stay on topic. I mean, that's what it's for, after all. Good trading to all...

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Boxing -- I was thinking about your offer and was about to start a list for you, but then it dawned on me -- Why not just participate with interested folks right here, openly, in this thread? In this way, we would all benefit from your expertise!

--- 帖子 #994 ---
yea good point actually i should have been posting more often but im barely keeping up with my own thread my studies are killin me and a trading job i took up for a while

--- 帖子 #995 ---
boxing, Good to hear from you man. I keep telling you, I'm worried about having to come up with some ransom money since you keep disappearing How's everything. By the way, I'm having great success with your method!!

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Jeff, I think you and I have corresponded once or twice before. If not, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm from Texas and have been getting schooled by boxing on his sexy theory. That being said, I would love to get some live trades going with everyone and I think as you said, it would be a lot easier for boxing to just participate in here.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Howdy JD, Nice to see you here! Yes, it's true -- Boxing has much he can share with us, and I couldn't agree more: Live trading is definitely welcome here...

--- 帖子 #998 ---
The problem I'm finding is that the threads don't stay active. As Boxing knows, I'll do my absolute best to keep it active. That being said, I'm going to start posting my potential Sexy and MTF setups as soon as the market opens. I think this will help to give us all confidence.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Great idea! We all look forward to your input. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Okay, i'ts 3:28AM here and I'm about to go back to bed I'm checking my charts..no Sexy setups but this one looks like a MTF setup. I'm looking for the 15/30 to cycle under the 23.6 level and turn up towards the 4hr. I'm guessing the 1h won't come down all the way but will probably turn up as the 15/30 turn around. I have my eye on that pivot point but with the 4h being high, I think it'll push past it when the move happens. I'm by far no expert on this but I'll be looking anyway.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Here's another one I'm watching. I'm hoping the 15/30 come down a little more before turning up and the 1h as well since it's too high for what I normally trade. 4h is in an uptrend crossing from below 20.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
I have been trading this for the past several months and an quite pleased with the results.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Well guys, if anyone took either of those two trades I posted when the 15/30 stochs turned up, you would be in profit. A nice 50+ move on the gbpusd and at least 25+ on the other one.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Here's yet another setup forming. Edit: I rode the 15m up to around 76.4 and then got out at +2.4 because the other stochs didn't follow. And as you would expect, it turned back and went to meet the 30m/1h which have also turned south as well. The 4h is still up overbought and flat. I'm in wait and see mode on this one.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Anyone care to chime in on this one? I'm watching it close, wanting to make it my last trade for the morning actually. I'm waiting on the bottom stochs to turn up for a classic "diving away from" trade. Still waiting on some other sexy setups to solidify.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
gbpaud big mover an up bar just closed and the current 4h bar hasnt taken off yet. its in pullback mode check the 30 min or any smaller timeframe than the 4h for a pullback then buy that way ull get a better price and less drawdown but if u enter now ull need a wider stop.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Can someone tell me why I don't have certain pairs in my MT4 setup? The pair that Boxing posted above does not show up in my list of pairs. Edit:: never mind, I figured it out.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Anyone took any trades today? Profits? losses? I took one that I knew I should've avoided. $10 loss..minor but I don't like to lose any money really.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Hello JD, I took 3 this morning, between 08:00 and 12:00 GMT, 1 short +13 pips and 2 long +10 pips each all in G/J and net of spread so not too bad.

Hello JD, I use Woodie's CCI method to enter and exit on M5 charts having determined the long, medium and short term trends using Spud's MTF Rope theory. The following may help.

Glenn5t, In your earlier posts you had 2 hour MAs on a 1 Hour chart. Could you please tell me how you did this or if there is an indicator that allows for this? thanks chuchu

--- 帖子 #914 ---
This week I was more selective....end result 2 trade 2 small wins come next week I'll practice another setup... - determine to be a buyer or seller by looking at previous day d1 stoch - use h1 stoch for entry (elasticity, rope, peak, sexy stoch etc) example - see the eurusd chart. when 3 previous day d1 stoch were below or about 10 level =&gt; seller. happy weekend!

The Asian Session begins at 7pm EST. So for Texas trading you would begin at 5pm your time. The session lasts for 8 hours.

I recently finished everything from Spud, Boxing's thread and this thread. What I have already started using to some extent successfully is combination of different things in there/here (stochastic related). I have one question for anyone still here. Do you use volume in any way in your strategy? I have personally tried some conventional indicators but I always come to the conclusion that I don't need anything more than just stochastics.
