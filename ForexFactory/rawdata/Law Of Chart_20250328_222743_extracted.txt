TRADE WHAT YOU SEE NOT WHAT YOU THINK CUS TRADING IS BUSINESS Hi Traders, Call me D O N ..... My new thread to introduce this method. I have been using other methods in my trading strategy but i decide to keep it simple in this amazing strategy, but the only reason for opening this thread is to bring out other interesting and amazing pattern that always form in a peak and valley in our charts..it can be small and it can be big to identify but it all depend on the time frame u are looking at, the choice is yours to use small Time frame for small target or big Time frame for big target remember the greater the Time frame the more the pattern get stronger...But to me i will be using 5min chart or 15min chart for entry and other TF for confirmation if i decide to hold my position for long term or intra-day. There is one thing that came in my mind before opening this thread, i have been searching for a thread that use this method on FF but still cant find any, i know it is very possible that someone is trading this method out there but none on FF or it might be in other format and that give me the main reason to bring it out and make it more popular. I have a very good friend that introduce me to it and more pro in this 1-2-3HL trading. we share Analysis and tell me if i am wrong or not I have found out that every now and then this pattern come out, sometime it play out but sometime it does not as they always say, there is no holy grail so no system give 100% good result there must be a time u will make wrong decision but what i am concern about is consistence profit, Min your loses and Max you profit with you Good MM don't forget your stop lose. It work for in every CURRENCY,STOCK,CFD COMMODITIES...Just a simple bars or candle high and low , read the book for more understanding. My platform does not allow custom indicator so i do everything manual Auto 2 prior day high &amp; low lines. Auto vertical line for new market session open I plot 50ema as my channel for breakout of RH, Ledge, Congestion,Trading Range from LOC.. The attachment below is the book of it so use it to learn and understand how to find this patterns.. Thanks for reading this thread and sharing your opinion, wish you all the best in your trading.. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/thumbsup.gif

Hi Donfriday, This is a very simple pattern and is very similar to what Feb is using in his 'The System II (with Irony)' thread. You have all the info there in the file you posted so not sure what more you need to know. I don't necessarily agree with you that the pattern is stronger on higher time frames. There are plenty of opportunities using it on 5min for example. You can trade all the minor trends in a longer term trend thus maximising your profit potential and making up for the extra spread you give to your broker trading the smaller time frame (whether this actually holds true given that you will have more losses on the lower time frame remains to be researched thoroughly -what a great thread that would make). The trick is to take every pattern without fail and to manage your risk (cut losses short), and hold profitable trades for potential runners (see the Feb thread as mentioned above). If you miss a trade opportunity then you might miss the runner for the day and your chance to recover losses and come out on top with profit. I suppose you just have to weigh up the pro's and cons of lower time frame trading. My biggest gripe with lower time frame is the sitting at the computer all day - not fun. A better entry using this pattern is the traders trick (Joe Ross). This enables you to get in before the hook is breached within a maximum of 4 bars. As long as you have a decent distance from entry and the hook to cover the costs (Spread/commission) of the full trade using one third of your lot size the method can be very profitable. These methods are strictly trend only methods so it is very important to identify when the market is in consolidation. You might try Joe's 'Camel Back' method, useful for keeping out of ranging markets. This uses a 40 ema channel (high and Low). When price is within the channel you simply stay out until a Hook occurrs outside of the channel, above for longs and below for shorts. My own adaptation is trade the traders trick within the channel as long as the channel isn't flat, but with a 'good' angle.

Thnx porkpie for the explantion, the question is how do i know that he used this method when the thread name is even far different from the method, u know i cant read all the thread on FF and none of is thread listed law of chart, yes i agreed it is similar and i have search for this method in this forum for a while now ...thanks for introducing the thread to me.. yes u can make more pips with tight sl on 5min after u spot ur S+R every reversal on bigger tf is a strong patern until it's violated like if u check this chart.. cheers and c ya...Don

--- 帖子 #4 ---
hi first thank u it looks great i havet read it yet but looks intrested..... i will read it and feedback u. good luck my friend.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Here's why people need to get informed around not to be caught repeating same methods. 1-2-3 hooks is basically what Feb's teach in his threads. Doesn't matter time frame, really works in all. Actually The system I(another Feb's excellent thread) is based on daily charts. Your intentions are good buddy but this subject has been covered already and is really a hot thread.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
thnx man....i agreed what u said...none of this method charts was post on other thread and this method remain in feb's thread so while i was searching i look for 1-2-3HL and law of chart on FF search i found none of this and i got tired...okay porkpie just introduce me to the thread and tell me how am i going to no this is the method when the name of the thread is The System II (with Irony)............it can just be his own develop system and i never check much on ff trading system but i searched for what i was looking for and did not find... now tell me opening a thread that sound like the system and easy to find what u know the method name from the founder isn't that easy ? Feb's thread is cool when i checked it out.. well anyone who have intention of it the attachment of the book is above ..cheers.....Don

--- 帖子 #7 ---
@ porkie PM Feb's and ask him if his using law of chart by Joe ross.......check this and tell me if that count was wrong..

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Don, your chart show's the RH correctly (but if you are trading off the weekly you would need 1K pip stop loss!). Feb just uses the break of a no. 2 point not a RH. Feb's rules are that you have to have a 30-40 swing to define a new trend.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
@porkie now u talking man feb's using it different while Joe ross is different....If i am wrong then what joe ross wrote was wrong in the book cus my friend that is making good pips with this saw this and took it.. yes we cant trade weekly but weekly tell u that after the brk of that RH we should go down again ...after a brk of first RH we should have pull back then trend continue.... i have read the book over and over and search for this method on ff before opening ...this is not my first thread but i decide to open it to introduce this to anyone interested... cheers..

interesting 25th bar broke down....still learning but i could see when they play.. c ya guys

--- 帖子 #11 ---
you want to see 123 setups with charts look at key to the mint

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I'm very glad that you start this thread about Joe Ross Law Of Charts . When i start learning about trading , one of the first book i read was DAYTRADING by Joe Ross , I recommend also TRADING IS A BUSINESS (you find practical tools for the management of your trade, risk, business, and yourself ) Keep up the excellent work !!!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
lol that is K. I. S. S.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hello, 123..!!! using Ross Hook 123 or Feb's style 123 or the guy coming from moon 123.. its all nothing but a simple tool for entery!!!.. a test of the market to see what will happen.. if its anything more amazing than that about it then I am all ears bro.. lol here is the thing my friend.. if you aint got a sound trade management inplace to compliment this then you got nothing.. sorry for being so blunt.. but this is about money.. you cant just leave poeple hanging out there with a simple 123 entery without a backup plan. Now the difference between what you have introduced so far based on RH and the guy from moon verses feb is that.. feb has also introduced ways as to how to handel trades enteries when they go wrong !!!.. which is more than half the times.. so it brings me to the my question from you: what you got inregardes to trade managment based on HR or your own experience for this thread? If your gonna refer to some automated manuall thing that god knows when Ross put it out and for poeple to follow it, then its safe to say that its not gonna be flexible enough to make adjustments to when market goes through cycles.. which it occures very often. If you ain't got any, then take the time to read the entire system II (with irony) 500+ pages and you might just underestand what that trade managments by feb means. Thank you,

Instead of making complain, go futher whit the info. Anyone can start a Thread about a subject that will be complete by readers like you... --------------- Nice thread, i went trough some of this and will be happy to see some more! take care all!

Lol i will not be using 1min bro ...i am using this method with 1hr-daily Trendline and 5min for my entry and trail most of my position....that is how to deal with it 1-2-3 in 1min is a Brain Job..lol...market dont talk nor tell where it's going we holy have knowledge abt current data we are receiving so i decide to keep it simple from now.....thanks for ur advice cheers

--- 帖子 #17 ---
hehe my bro..Long time what have u been up to and how is my beloved country naija? take care and wish u the best..cheers don

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thank for checking out my thread bro...you should no rite that feb's method is a little bit different from what Joe Ross is doing, it might look similar but read the book and compare it to what his doing u shall give me prove.. the fact that i open the thread should give u more clue that this guy is not a newbie or u think i got vouch cus i was not making Good call..go Auslanco thread ask abt Don u will get many answers. i have prove this method from my friend, he trade only technical and make good calls to me which i could not even find out, he always tell me that market will go down and come back to pick his entry i always doubt it but in a twinkle of an eye price pull back and pick is entry i asked him how did u know this will happen, he lol and say it's law of chart, who will not ask what is law of charts ....so after back testing from him and i read the book and making Good calls i decide to make a research on few forum i found 1 but none in ff, feb's name is different from the method... let just say it's new thread and more post is on the way the founder of this method will surely come in cus his also on this forum and i already seek for his support so more question can be answered in a proper way... cheers..Don

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thankx Bro, u welcome to my thread.....i have been seeing your post on other thread i salut sir....Keep up the good work...cheers Don

I think the traders trink entry is superior with regards to trade management for the very reasons why you would enter before the Ross Hook. Take a look at the attachement. The Ross Hook in this instance is used as a first target to cover costs of the trade with a third of the lot size. What often happens when price comes back to a RH level is that the RH will act as a level of resistance or support turning price around in the opposite direction. Sometimes price will break above the RH then quickly turn around triggering stops the other side of the RH trapping traders into a move. By getting in earlier than the RH you give your trade full potential cover costs and may even make some profit by targeting the RH with part of your trade. For example. If the trade does not go your way beyond the RH: 1 Lot into thirds= Part 1 - target RH. Part 2 - Breakeven. Part 3 - Original Stop or moved to half the original size.

Thanks for posting the TTE Pdf....that was awesome....yeah the bar the bar after the brk out and if the next bar fail to make a new high we have our RH.. I think trading simple without indicator seems to be the deal in this market and trading what u see not what u think can lead to more successful winning position consistence.. I will be posting my trades by using the 1-2-3HL-RH with some trendline ....Thankx for your support and have a good weekend.. Don

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Guys, I will be using TL channel on 1hr-daily for my TL setup and turn my chart to 5min to pick my entry as early as i can and always trail my profit step by step. i can also decide to close my position by using my TL for my target of market go my way but if not after are perfect 1-2-3HL i will be waiting for profit or sl and this will be a trend following, i am 100% poor in fundamental and this will be ignored in all my trading setup cus this method don't involve news and we are going to do what market want not what we want, in my early trading i experience that everytime i trade bias and pick entry without signal cus my bias say so, i sometime get burn or run into profit vice-versa, such is life...lol We are always newbie to the market, so we will not be making decision on our own than to stick to our trading rules,but we all knew that market is filled with several emotion, we cant grab all the pips in the market than to pick what is offered and stay out when trend is ranging cus market need to make decision before trend change or continuation from the previous trend after the breakout. don't try to revenge in the market cus u have some losing position, it's bad and make things worse, it's hard to archive patience but believe me it's the best thing in life...a proverb says if u want to eat with lion u must turn to lion. so we need sometime to make correction and find the reason to our failures and accept our failure ...failure teaches success..market always give if we follow and take back if we trade what we think against the market. Thanks for reading and i look forward to ur support.. Cheers Don

It's this the indy you use ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
i used show123v2....i will not be using indi beside the 1-2-3HlL,RH and Brkout counting indi just to give me less stress in counting and will make it more easy for me.. and after reading the book and my knowledge in finding the 1-2-3-RH i will put my eye on the counting and will know if the indi counting is wrong .. i was a indi fun b4 but i think i am such a complicated guy to use indi, i found out while i was checking the reason for some of my failures in my trading background. you are free to use what u want but i am more fun of using TL now to keep it more simple.. thanks for your support and let see what this coming week bring to us...cheers..Don

Okay EU forming another bearish 1-2-3H after the last 1-2-3H that started since June and completed in June and breakout in July before RH in august and price continue up trend.. if the weekly 1-2-3H and RH still hold i am looking at my smaller tf this week with my sl for my entry and trailing if position run into profit...the 1-2-3 on weekly is not complete yet until price go below point 2, and still valid if price don't go above point 1 but when such pattern form on bigger tf it need special focus and entry dis does not mean price may not continue uptrend but it's a bearish signal that the current uptrend that started early this year is about to end.. thanks ..Don

--- 帖子 #28 ---
This is a formation that gives the origin and end of price movement as it has been proved that no reversal is completed with formation of 123. Similarly, 123 formation can be compared with the great Eliot wave if well understood. But i think DON i m proud of u for opening this thread. Prince_larri

--- 帖子 #29 ---
good morning, I was in bed when the first set up came but price have pill back to a point and formed another pattern..i am taking the RH as i just woke up and will only pick entry and trail when i am on pc will not let profit position run into loses ..entry turning to pivot is better than losing 1pip.. I am looking to adjust and might pick the TTE, tight sl and trail profit till it close or close when it's time for pull back ..

--- 帖子 #30 ---
oh my big bro, that is true and i am Glad you introduce me into it for having you on FF, well i always doubt and wondering this pattern but after my conversation with you on many occasion i try to ignore u but now i think u make sense, this stuffs come more often..you are welcome and i look forward to you support, so i can get better since u are more pro in this law of chart..

this is a counting indi just to view the point 1-2-3 of HL and RH, it's nothing much but just to have less street in counting the H&amp;L and RH...keep it simple

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Kinda busy cant post, ...catching good time with gu ..lost some set up on eu..

--- 帖子 #37 ---

--- 帖子 #40 ---
GJ target weekly brkout bar.....

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I think naked chart is cool for me, giving me small loses and big profit when they play out using small tf for entry and big tf ror main direction... no dirty chart to confuse me ..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hello DonFriday and all around here, Don how does the indicator Show 123_Rh_BB works, because I did see on forward testing that after some movement number 1 and 2 disaper, them they were back and now I have RH signal. When does the signal will not desaper? (I'm using 5 Min charts). Thank You

--- 帖子 #43 ---
the indi is for less stress in counting only ur own counting is for the confirmation ....have you read the Book?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
if you read my post i mention i will not be using indicator..this is naked chart trading method but i decide to use trendline for my own view of some key levels that indicator is not indi that u could use for trading ur target, it only help u in counting the set up which mean u have to use the law of chart to confirm it.... read the first book law of charts and TTE that was posted in page 2 from porkpie..if u have any question then ask me i will be more happy to assist you..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This is how I trade Don, simple stuff. Some people try to make it harder than what it is I don't agree with the getting in before the break, it either breaks or it doesn't.I look at sup/res pivots and so on but let PA do its stuff. Theres a good thread that died a while back called "Peaks and Valleys", you should check it out.I trade around the 1 min,5 min, 15 min charts and wait for 1 2 3s. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks bro, yeah i like naked stuffs it show clearly than complicated things so i use trendline to filter movement so i feel much more comfortable..with ur experience and want to get in early u can decide to get in early but TTE is also a good entry. i just checked that thread it was a booming one but not sure what happen they stop posting since last year... hope u check in often..cheers Don

--- 帖子 #47 ---
due to the low momentum in the up move and my bro incident i could not add more but my entry size is okay for my equity..simple and naked..Lolz

--- 帖子 #48 ---
hi don, I'm using on the daily set up for this 123 method, here my set up for this uj inside trading range on daily, what do you think is that the valid buy for this UJ ?? on the wk tf i see more bullish on the control of pa rgds,

--- 帖子 #49 ---
the first chart was wrong, i dont know how to use line chart but the thirdchart was okay and cus u are using daily this is a good entry base on TTE... yeah i see u have some buy on uj already i guess that was small tf entry ..nice 1 if daily confirm the breakout UJ will rise more..IMO welcome to my thread

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Don what setting are you using on the v2 indicator, our are they default.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
i did not change anything ...default ...and the rules thats all...min lose if i get it wrong max profit if i get it rite.. welcome on board

--- 帖子 #52 ---
this is a little consolidation going on GU 5min ...i am waiting for breakout of this zone before i take any trade on gu...

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Don I actually took that trade, I am out now. It was just a quicky, took 10pip.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
what trade was that?..well if u took 10pips on a trade it will depend on ur risk ratio and confident..i dont take 10pips trade..bu the time u have a clear 1-2-3 confirmation ur sl might be 20-30-50 it depend how big and small it form on my 5min chart entry.. if u have any other question?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hello Mr. donfriday, thank you for sharing your tradeing strategie here. I am searching for a strategie which I can trade manuell and with which I can win in long term. Have you trade your shared system from here a longer time and can you say that it is possible with this strategie to win in long term? Thank you again for any helps.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I sold gj cus 1-2-3 complet and got broken after price came back to test it again then price made it lower low .. it it may go against me but this is a complet signal as i got it...let see how it play out .nothing much to risk 50pips

--- 帖子 #57 ---
dont be deceived every system fail but this method is a origin of every end and beginning of every trend in the market, it's not my system but is from one of the guru in this market u can find him any where in google..search for Joe Ross..i am only sharing it on here so u can have better view than not only indi make money but naked chart is even the best if u follow the rules of this method...yes this system was introduce to me when i started trading but i always ignor it but my friend who use it laugh me and say i should choose what i want..i was having some failure and due to my complicated attitude i could not handle indicators so i had to come back and finish what i started...i have price action experience so that make it more simple when using naked chart...every tf must form 1-2-3h&amp;l when the current trend is over before change .. read the first book and TTE, come and ask me anything about it and i will share what i know..my lose is less 50 pips max but i can get over 100 when it go my way cus i will not close my trade until i see another 1-2-3 so what i will be doing is trailing my profit.. cheers and welcome..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
trail out 20pips ....nice trade i think after price forming RH

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hello Don, Please can you post chart picture from this after this trade. I just want to compare withc mine. Thanks

--- 帖子 #60 ---
i sold point 2 after retest...every RH is a trailing warning so u need to adjust ur trail well and dont forget the spread of the pair u trading on every tick move.. another 1-2-3 was form there but because 15tf is also forming 1-2-3H so i decide not take this anymore .. all the tf much form 1-2-3H or L with pull back to test point 2 after breakout.. if u still dont understand let me know

--- 帖子 #61 ---
another setup is forming but we cant prove it confirmed until we go below point 2 but if u cannot wait for the breakout then u accept u are taking the risk..

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thank You Don for all your atention. A lot of help with the charts that you are posting. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #63 ---
u are welcome...1-2-3 H or L will always be in ur chart if u see well u will make ur decision .. take time complet the book ..the indi is for low stress as i mention it repain the counting sometime so i dont base anything on it but less street.. cheers have trade safe

--- 帖子 #64 ---
another short on eu ..i post it before taking the entry ...

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Trade I've just exited.Low stress stuff. I knew where my entry was and my stop. I took profit where I was comfortable.

--- 帖子 #66 ---

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hi don, noted with thanks to remain me of TTE brgds

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Don, Your threads are very interesting I'm going to start to read your threads on this weekend but which one first?. So do you mind to compare between these 2 systems. I myself rite now using 123, I've read most of joe ross books. Regards

--- 帖子 #70 ---
you are welcome bro...i open the threads to provide some stuffs, not everyone have the cash to buy books or easy to find online..chaos is nice 1-2-3 is nice....but i dont want to be using indicator anymore.....I will not be using chaos for now so sinner and others will be posting there i told them i want to use naked chart..i am complicated to read indicators and so far i am doing okay with naked chart , small sl big target so that is how to deal with this crazy market dont give what u have back i blew several acc and I'm still on recovery level ..... since you already have joe ross knowledge then stick to it dont jump around even when it fail do it u will master it .. u are much welcome ...let us make some pips and share what we know.. cheers Don

--- 帖子 #71 ---
we could test the consolidation zone before up trend continuation but our target still remain 149-150 that is where our daily previous RH is sitting ..but right now 15tf is looking to form RH ......interesting 15min chart it just gave a double low from the current bar and previous bar which mean it will be the RH if no lower low...that is how is work ..keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks Don for express reply. I've just rechecked - well there are mt4 indi's(123 &amp; RH) in your thread somemore, that's great Best regards &amp; also making big big pips

--- 帖子 #73 ---
u welcome i also found it in this forum the programmer did not find it useful but i do so i took it lol..gj 15tf is giving me nice clue so i am waiting for few min to see the complet RH then sell below ..small target before i sleep then come back london for major trend

--- 帖子 #74 ---
imagine i have sell without waiting for RH and set my pending order, this would have become red and bad entry ....that is why it's called law of chart...the RH form as expecting and pending order was set on rite place but gj did not make lower low then bounce..interesting

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Don, Would you please advise if the usdcad chart 1hr tf set up 1-2-3 and the TTE entry point on the chart thanks rgds,

--- 帖子 #76 ---
you got it perfect bro..but dont try to sell it that was nice set up and pull back for new momentum...it's a bullish trend so even it go below point 3 dont sell point 1 and 2 is the sauce of the begining ...nice one

--- 帖子 #77 ---
this 15tf is called trades trick what a trap for sellers and gj went to make new high...lol...i got them on tail

--- 帖子 #78 ---
noted with thanks don, daily TF the pullback and bullish pressure, weekly tf also in-process of bullish and weak of bearish, overall bottom area PA on progress ...

--- 帖子 #79 ---
hi don, Eurusd 15TF, 1-2-3 set up

--- 帖子 #80 ---
hi don, now i'm entry long for this usdcad base on TTE 1hr TF also usdchf i'm entry long

--- 帖子 #81 ---
nice bro...i like that.. in that uchf chart u will never stop counting 1-2-3 until we have complet 1-2-3 with breakout bar...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
nice bro i also short eu too.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
my gu... until we make new low today before this info will destroy until then trailing will be my decision ...

--- 帖子 #84 ---
hi don, aud 15tf inside trading range look nice if break out to downside what do you think?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Great trades Don. Nice trending markets for the Ross Hooks.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
that was pull back ..check what i post to you and try to read the book again . remember that every time frame must form 1-2-3H or L before they continue so u also need other tf to correspond with ur small tf if ur target is more..like i mention i am using 5,1hr and daily but i think i will need 15tf also so i added it...the pull back on 5 min will form 15tf 1-2-3hl if the breakout is valid and will continue.. i cant be more pro in it but picking entry and exit is not a big deal ..

--- 帖子 #87 ---

hi don, GJ is the nicely set up 1-2-3 for this week

--- 帖子 #93 ---
1-2-3 is an old trading method for trend reversal if spotted at the top/bottom of the trend..... and as long as trend is making HH or HL, or LL and LH............ the area with circle is where the 123 trend change occurred and as mkt is making HH and HL , the uptrend still intact, the second circle marked the top reversal which signifies exit from the long for a short trade. nice way of trading........... for those who caught GU............ nice trend with over 300pips as long as the trend is making HH and HL. dont know much about the ROSE HOOK but am pretty sure, he will be doing same thing. but will thank friyo for bringing this sexy method to FF thumb up

--- 帖子 #94 ---
thnx bro and welcome sharing more...hmm u call me friyo this guys will lost, they kinda dont know what friyo mean ..lol i had nice trade on gj from 142.29 closed already an and gu and been taking small losses and more pips..what matter is consistence sometime 1-2-3 fail but not always ..no holy grail so i am feeling better keeping it simple, better than those decoration indicators..lol

my views on GJ ..trade what you see not what you think....we have a complet 1-2-3L on weekly chart and since it got broken price just came back to test it at point 2, looking at it now we likely to reverse.. our 1hr chart is showing consolidation so if price manage to violate this to the up or down and form RH will re-difines a trend so i will be watching price at 150 or any RH form.. ...

Hi Mate, the truth is always had to say sometime but i will tell u that u will never find 100% system in this market and each time u decide to change system will be same incident...u cant find holy grail and market dont tell where it will go we mostly try to predict the trend direction and not always that we get it rite, u should know this and believe u are always a newbie in the market no matter the amount uu making u still gonna get it wrong sometime but the truth is i dont care when my system fail in 1 day what i care abt is when it fail to make consistence profit. everyone will tell u there system is good but if u read my first post i mention a friend introduce me to it and i fnd this method useful that is why i decide to open this thread, the choice is urs, try to backtest it and u will find the result..but for me i feel good with it so far, when i get it wrong my sl is 50, when i get it rite i can get more than i want cus i trade 1 of the volatile currency GBP/JPY. I still using it and making pips but when i pick my entry on 5min chart i look other tf, some people use 1min and 3min but since i am using MT4 so what i use most for entry is 5min and use other tf to see the trend direction, every tf form 1-2-3H&amp;L but ask urself do u want to scalp, intra-day or long term...that is where ur trading time frame come out from .. go here and load the books read it and test it then come back to ur question when you post .. Good luck..Don http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...15&amp;postcount=1 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...6&amp;postcount=20

Hello all, Can somebody tell me what's the diference betwen this 2 indicators: Show123v2 and show123Rh_BB I did read the document about Show123Rh_BB indicator, but signals looks that are the same. Can some one here confirm these? Thanks

Hi Don, Have you ever come across 'Trading Manual' by Joe Ross which I made a note but I cant remember the page said:- 1st. Exit if 2 prices bar are against us continious. 2nd. 3bars rule - if you have not at least covered cost by the 3 bars appear on the chart then EXIT or 4-5 bars(depend on your rule). Note : I'm revising law of chart &amp; trading manual if I happen to see this page i'll let you know. I've seen you are making heap of the pips. Cheers

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi everyone, I'm glad to see people following this wonderful stuff. We should all move to the Joe Ross forum and continue there with this conversation so he can comment and give us his insight. http://tetradersforum.com/forum/index.php

Don: How do you manage your trades? Where do you place your initial stop and at which point do you take profits to cover costs? If a trade goes wrong do you let it hit your initial stop loss or do you terminate the trade earlier? If you terminate your trade before it hits the initial stop, what are the criteria for it? Sorry lots of questions come into my head. Otherwise The Law of Charts is very simple and easy to understand. Viva la trading nacked%&amp;&amp;!!

--- 帖子 #128 ---

Hi my30marahaba, Your posts are great too apart from don, interesting, are using 4hrs tf only? and I've seen in your charts your are using stoch &amp; macd too. Do you mind to share your trading ideas? Thanks Pete

--- 帖子 #136 ---
hi pete thks, actually the 1-2-3 H method is the great method this is part of TLOC (the law of chart), entry point we are using TTE (Trader Trick Entry) for the detail of it try to read the trading by the book presented by Mr Joe Ross Summary of TLOC 1. Break out of 1-2-3 H 2. Break out of Ledge (consolidation area) 3. Break out of Trading range (consolidation area) 4. Break out of Rh Here my strategy of my template I'm using 3 LWMA's - 20 LWMA primary trend line , 45 LWMA or 55 LWMA secondary trend line, 135 LWMA Major trend line. to supported the three ma i'm using stoch 5-3-1 and the MCAD 12-26-0 just watch closely when the pa hit the line on 20lwma, 45lwma and 135 lwma, using the summary of TLOC to find the signal, for your entry point please using TTE rule to manage risk and reward. Tips for you - Only take into trade when the market ready and you are ready too Good Luck cheer

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Bro i like the way you use the method and even me i have combine it into 1 ...my previous strategy was profitunity so i am doing it 2 in 1 now since law of chart is a breakout and naked chart so i will be able to spot everymove better...Good Job mate..

EG daily and possible pull back next week if today refuse to make new low on wednesday bar...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Gj is approaching a strong resistance 0f 153.21 so this could bring a possible pull back IMO.....gu forming 123h and will be selling if price break RH that tell the breakout is valid if we get below the current RH on 15tf

--- 帖子 #148 ---
..This is why i said if the signal was valid..according to my sell limit it was a tick below the low on that Rh and spread added gu did not make it to that point it rather make another RH making double bottom and continue it up move till now....some signal can be invalid but this method Keep me away more time...

--- 帖子 #149 ---
waiting for breakout.....

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks my30marahaba Cheers

--- 帖子 #151 ---
this short did not signal on any tf than 5min, news crash gj not even a signal RH form but it look forming now for a pull back...

waiting for clear direction to pick new entry on geppy...indecision on 15tf till we make a new low or TTE point the bars below green point 3

--- 帖子 #155 ---
EU will be much more fun to trade for next week from what i see right here .....

--- 帖子 #156 ---
the trend on 1hr chart here still on the down side cus we have not form complet 1-2-3L the current 1-2-3H we have for the downtrend found a strong support down there with a double bottom as you can see i note double RH RH there...we can also say the low of the last 3 bars is point 1 point since we dont know what next market will be like we need not to observe on it than to old previous short position and wait for more confirmation...

--- 帖子 #157 ---
as we can see here 15tf is on a range before market close and when it open it might be a Gap down if the down trend should continue cus we Keep making lower lower start from the 1st RH after complet 1-2-3H, each bar was making a lower lows but trend could not continue so this is more a range ..a break of this 3 RH form tripple bottom will surely give us another RH after the breakout to test it low and re-defines a new downward movement.. Daily GJ scenario was more perfect cus it show a strong RH that price could not break .. All eyes will be on GJ for me this week cus it's more trending lately and easy to grap pips due to is volatility.. Cheers Don

--- 帖子 #158 ---
This thread is very interesting donfriday

--- 帖子 #159 ---
views on gj weekly , yes i dont need to use this method for weekly check but sometime i like to hold my position until trailing stop be out, but the scenario on GJ weekly as not confirm any bullish yet cus the current weekly candle that will close tonight did not make a higher high above point 3 and our 1-2-3H is still a valid cus we just had a RH at 139 and strong pull back...this is why i will focus much more on GJ this week...this week candle that will open tonight need not to make a new high if 153.21 should hold it to go down cus we need RH on daily chart so my eyes will be much more on it cus i am seeing a better chance and trending in GJ bigger picture..

--- 帖子 #160 ---
you are much welcome and thx for the chart it look nice .. cheers Don

--- 帖子 #161 ---

The 1-2-3 on daily is between bull and bear and so fat...I am still holding my short till i see more confirmation to close or add more but till then trailing is alive to keep it safe..we need a break of those 2 lines to have any cluse of the direction ..

I found this thread today and i love it guys, Im new to forex , and i love the 123 , i just downloaded the indicators and ill try them. i was wondering if we get in at 3 instead of waiting for break of 2... with a stop little below 3, less risk? Anyone tried this way? I was trying last couple days just price action, no indicators trying to see 123 M or W formats but getting in ta the test which is 3 with small stop, i had some decent results, im going to try the indicator ,it will help see better the patterns. Thanks

--- 帖子 #178 ---
you are welcome Bro...I have been busy so my post was less...have u read the TTE?..

--- 帖子 #179 ---
EJ ...some nice set up ...

--- 帖子 #180 ---
hi DOn, i was so exited about the thread that i post a reply before even reading the TTE lol.... Ive read a little bit now and wow thats all i have to say... That pattern happens all the time man its like a double bottom(or double top) Like today i used on 5min chart on eurjpy but as a newbie i close the trade too soon for only70pips as it went flying after i closed...Anyways I will read the whole TTE and the whole thread so i can learn more about this method man .. Thanks alot , great thread DON Keep it UP thanks

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Great keep it up ...Everyone is newbie in this market only few experience make us different.

Hi polapip , ... for purpose of the trades using 1-2-3 Rh there was a 5 min. T/F, but generally I'm not using a conventional time-frames any longer because now my charting and trading is based on (5 pips) range bars, which I reckon are giving much better view on real price action. Have a good week-end.

Hi, ... there is a shit-loads of info re: range bars on a net, but basically this is just different view on price action, which eliminates the time as a main factor. " ... Nicolellis Range Bars were conceived in 1995 by a Brazilian broker and trader - Vicente M. Nicolellis Jr . During 13 years running a trading desk in Sao Paulo, where local markets tend to be volatile, he wrestled with the problem of how to handle this volatility and its variability. Finally he concluded that the most promising approach would be to eliminate time from the equation, and just concentrate on price. After all it is price that you trade rather than time (unless it is an options market) Essentially this reverts to the early days of technical analysis, and the use of point an figure charts which just record price changes. By using a constant range, ex: 5, 7, 10, etc. and opening a new bar once that range is covered, one can also apply modern concepts of indicators, which are bar based. In 1996 the concept was computerized, which meant that many more markets could be studied. Experience has shown that Nicolellis Range Bars are particularly good at focusing on and clarifying movement. The way in which a long meandering, horizontal congestion is condensed into a bar or two, concentrates attention on the essential underlying price movement while eliminating unnecessary clutter and noise. This also makes the use of trendlines easier ... " Have a good look on the two charts attached and compare them closely. As a picture can tell a thousands words.

Hi My03marahaba, What TF are you using? I've seen you are using 4hrs Thanks Have a good weekend

--- 帖子 #196 ---
hi pete, actually TLOC (The Laws of Chart) is working for all Time Frame why ?? coz TLOC is the Laws of the chart. But for my analyze i'm always have to look for the higher TF 1. Weekly TF - 1-2-3 H&amp;L, Rh, trading Range, Ledge, consolidation area 2. Daily TF - 1-2-3 H&amp;L, Rh, trading Range, Ledge, consolidation area 3. 4 Hr TF - 1-2-3 H&amp;L, Rh, trading Range, Ledge, consolidation area 4. 1 Hr TF - 1-2-3 H&amp;L, Rh, trading Range, Ledge, consolidation area and etc..... in my chart i'm using 3 MA, but i always looking for the set up 1-2-3 H&amp;L if the price near 55 LWMA (2nd - secondary trend line ) and 135 LWA (3rd - Major trend line) if you got the point #2 and point #3 at 4 Hrs TF, you can enter your order from the lower TF, with the TTE or break out of the summary TLOC this is could help you to minimize your SL and advanced entry to the trade. you can using which one TF as long as make you satisfied to trade using 1-2-3 H&amp;L cheer

--- 帖子 #197 ---
How are you bro? ....I am working on some stuffs to add on this method so will update you guys when i am done..I have the feelings it can max some profit on entry ... Cheers Don

--- 帖子 #206 ---
hi, i read a little in this thread, not all but i reconised some important thing. If u use the Law Of Chart rules, u should read all of the document and follw it as close as possible. What u considered to be a 1-2-3 high is a congestion. Read Page 43 : Identifying Congestion It is very important : J. Ross said there "One of the concepts every trader must learn is how to know when prices are in congestion" and also: "Any Time prices open or close on four consecutive bars , ......." U cannot survive on M5 Charts if u do not follow this Rules cause M5 Charts a full of startinf Trends ending in a Measuring bar and 4 or more Bars in the same range.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
on ur 5min chart ..there was no higher low bars precceding to point 2 so it chould take u abt 3 bars and if the 4th bar overlap the third and fifth bar u will have point 2 and 3 on same bar.. ur 5min chart was in congestion ..1-2-3 in congestion does not mean anything so a break of the congestion and the first RH to form re-defined a new trend using TTE

--- 帖子 #208 ---
hi MJurban, Noted with thanks for your correction cheer

hi don, thanks

Hi Don, Thank you for your interesting thread. I have also been watching the current situation of EU. For potential breakouts, it's gonna be interesting to watch other pairs like USD/CAD, EUR/CAD, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, USD/CHF, GBP/CHF. Currently, those pairs are in a consolidation.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
we are close to high of today and if this bull should continue we need some pull back in this zone cus we need RH for total momentum to run the buy ..

congestion for now until is break point 2...i think u have 50ema on your chart right? ...that is what i use it for breakout...todays high can also be point 1 bro so we need to break 1 of this direction so we are still in congestion... Thanks for you support bro..

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I would like the GJ to breakout the current consolidation on the upper side, but set the trigger on both sides. Sorry for stepping in, my30marahaba. In my experience, many Asian breakouts on CAD pairs are false (off course sometimes they are right). But, you know, you can't get anything without risking small pips so I think it's nothing wrong to go for it. But today both CAD Employment figure and NFP are coming, both of which move the market like crazy. So I personally will try to secure some pips by the time.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
yes bro 45EMA/50EMA that for break out purpose which the ema as secondary trend line

--- 帖子 #226 ---
noted with thank's bro for your kindly info of this cad curr

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Bro, Keep the light shinning and may this no stop shinning, i m just too happy for u and i m glad u re in the club finally. You re welcome to the club of 123. prince_larri

--- 帖子 #228 ---
My pleasure, mate. CAD pairs are good when you are in a right direction. As for the GJ long brekout, I only took 10 pips and got away before the retracement happened. I normally don't close too early, but there was no momentum as I wanted. If it was a real breakout, the price must have moved really fast, but it wasn't. So I'm glad I closed it with a little bit of profit. I don't know what to do next. I won't carelessly jump in, but I'll ride on it when I see the right price action like Don and my30marahaba do here.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
hi FEM, I'm still watching this cad currency not yet taken IN the trade waiting until the pa break out the consolidation area 1st then i will see the good entry point now see the updated cad chart nicely if the pa break out to upward D1,H4 and 1hrs TF is on the bullish camp cheer

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi my30marahaba, Yea, looking for an entry after the breakout of the consolidation would be much better, I guess, especially for CAD. Just be cautious about CAD Emp figure. FEM

short 1-2-3H closed 5 green and now waiting for point 2 or we remain in congestion if next bar cant go above point 2

--- 帖子 #232 ---
hi don &amp; all, What is your view for this NU on daily TF, in my view down trend to be in progress next week is the important for this NU see the 1-2-3 set up, what do you opinion for it don?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
i think the decision should come from this eu daily on ur NU ....we need not to make new high above thursday candle...fine i dont trade NU but EU havea lot of decision to make on it and if this pattern is not destroy ur decision is right but 2day is a day for many pair to have some direction .. thursday bar need to hold but if not this current 1-2-3H might destroy EU is still Billish but we are just having some reversal sign. IMO..

--- 帖子 #234 ---
thanks don for your advise 2day is the important day of some currency and to be observation when the US news tonight and NY open cheer

hi don, enclosure the usdcad failure break out of 4hr tf now see on 5MTF the pa look like make it new lower, here the chart opening day with the gap, break out of the ledge is the nice sell entry, after that consolidation in side trading range if break to down side we will see new lower of this cad. plz advise don if this the valid sell signal??? thanks for sharing ....... cheers

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Nice 1...you catch what i do but i have not update it yet cus i am to busy....2 horizontal line of prior day high and low 1 vertical line of market open..Nice Not bad idea bro but if you already have your position in place no need to follow it than to protect and let it run..EU daily 1-2-3High fail so the low of last week is now point 1 and the doji after the long bar that follow last week low is point 2 and 3 so this is back in a buying mode, this should turn ucad into bearish IMO.. also ucad daily is giving 1-2-3High so the sell is still valid but nothing work bet all the time.. sell is valid on ucad just wait for pull back and 1hr need to give RH so that trading range will get test again ..

This indicator is used for counting 1-2-3 and RH only and it repaint because it count incomplete 123 so as not to kill the thread or get newbie run into wrong entry i removed it...well newbie can use it for practice but my main trading platform does not allow custom indi and i prefare finding the levels with my eyes. .. .....okay click here (show123RH.zip )..........

hi don, GU 5M TF using volume as the filter

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Nice 1 bro, my friend Malcolmb in auslanco explain so much abt volume to me i think it help alot in the bars as momentum and market participant, but main entry still base Law of chart .. I have to send the thread name back to the main study so as to keep it cool and free to add your own indicator as you want....the thread is not for me alone.. cheers i will study that volume book when i can and keep the first post of the start update with new info that catch my hand..

--- 帖子 #257 ---
hey the don, how u dey? i will advice you dont pay much attention to VSA imho, VSA is good really, it talks more about momentum and price action per candle stick. 1-2-3 is a failure of a trend, hence reversal.......... my trading partner uses VSA and trades very well so i know wot am saying. let me give u a good scenario, yesterday, EU mostly ranged between 1.4985 and 1.5020 . around 6-7pm GMT i had the opportunity to long euro bcoz price stopped making LL and LH around the support range of the day, as i entered long, my friend who is a vsa trader said good long base on stop volume...... later in the trade vsa was giving 'no demand bar' so he asked me to get out but i told him no until i see price stop making HH and HL to cut the story short, my tgt was hit and price reversed. U see, trading is simple, no matter how meticulous we are, we will still lose on some trades, so why complicate it. 1-2-3 is good if u can spot good level that might bounce, 4hr-wkly s/r or PPZ level shd be watched on 5mins and trade the reversal I also took GU long for massive pip on the failure of price to break monday low which also condluences with good s/r this present euro push up is also gave a good entry off 5mins as the support held also. keep it simple as user............... mkt waves HH HL or LL LH and a bridge of this will give 123 and if it happens at good level. u will make money almost every time

--- 帖子 #258 ---
thnx bro..i am not volume person as i said above ...Law of chart is still the main entry and still keep it simple using my 5min for trend reversal.. thnx for your advice..

Hi, I have been a member here for a little while and I ran across a thread once where a man said there is only 1 tool/indicator anyone ever needs. I was over a year into forex and had over 1200 indicators crossing the signals of my mind and blinding me from the simple truth of any market. Months went bye, i did not trade, or even look at or open my platform. My mind mind was figuring out the solution without my knowing. It occured to me that the markets are more simple than this forum and your complicated minds would lead us to believe. I see this thread and it looks good, real good. I do it a little differently but I believe it is similar. I believe in myself and NOONE else, that is the first trick, second trick...FE, play with FE maually until you see the answer. Thanks for the great info. Peace.

I havent looked at the exact time of your trade, EU was trading a very long time around this 1.50 level and I took some good and some bad trades, .....better for me to stand aside then. Don, is he still there and posting sometimes ? I find this idea ( Law of Charts ) quite good, and it can easily compliment other trading styles, because it is more like an exact look at the structure and behaviour of bars / patterns. Cheers,

Hello Don, here are some indies, but it might be not exactly the one you are looking for. But since I havent posted any charts yet I thought I might be of some use if I send you this. I have a whole arsenal of indies, just ask. Point is however, the reason why I am interested in Law of Charts ( and some other threads ) is because I want to reduce this and trade more on PA and structure of the market itself. I wish you and my30heraba a great week !

nice trade bro and like i told u on that GJ 4hrs was only forming it 123 low for the running up 145.50 so my projectiong work well... okay let me show u what i see on all USD pairs..this is dx dollar index that will lead all major..dollar was bought from the bottom and heading to first resistance after broken first RH on daily so that point should be tested and anything can happen cus of the historical resistance in that zone. friday candle broke the first RH after completing 123low on daily so dollar is bullish vise versa as a trader u should know what will happen next.. i am using a friend laptop to send u this chart so the graphics may be bad... cheers we talk later..

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Came across this thread a few days ago, must say.. this is gold!! I have not finished reading the thread nor have I traded off the indicator yet. Still trying to fully understand. Big thanks to Don and all the posters, hope to be a contributor and ask some questions no doubt. Nice attitude from all the posters unlike a few other threads that are to be found on FF . My charts are not entirely naked, use pivots , resistance and a RSI for divergence, are these indi's acceptable if I post charts? Been on another thread where they hang you if don't post an entirely naked chart.. Thanks all and I am reading the PDf books, big help

--- 帖子 #447 ---
u welcome bro...you are free to use indicator, this method is not only used as naked chart i have found out after several practice that u can also use indicator it's only High and Low of bars pattern so adding ur own indicator does not stop u from locating the reversal it still the same...trend start trend end that is what this method is all about.. cheers and feel free to share your mind, we are all here to learn..

--- 帖子 #448 ---
hi don, still cool bro... same like u 1st time i traded i was using ozfx methd (this is combination stoch, ac and ao), and then pimpology (3cci with diffrence TF) and the DIBs Method, Master Candle &amp; Candle pattern and then TLOC now i'm learning about trend and trend line as resistance and support ......... cheer

good u can use that indicator to practice...but dont forget u will see several 1hr in congestion or trading range they mean nothing but RH mean alot.. cheers trade safe and see you next week.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I took some of those, are you using the RH indi from the beginning of this thread ? I find don´s and my30´s charts excellent learning examples. All of you have a nice weekend and thank you !

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Yes, I am using the indicators from the thread, hope to do it manually after I get to know and understand this method fully.. BTW, did 7 trades today using this system, 1 BE, 1 loss for 10 pips and 5 wins for 41 pips for a net of 31 pips all shorted. Method is gold, been trading stocks for over 20 years ,Forex since May with mixed results, getting excited about this method. Seriously think there is merit in the method with good MM and a sound knowledge of charting. Several weeks ago did away with indicators except a RSI for divergence, results for me increased all most immediate then found this thread to help add to my bottom line.. Enjoy the week-end

--- 帖子 #456 ---
hi don, EU on the down trend movement what do you think bro see my chart base on 123 set up - TLOC analyze this week should be more lower if the weekly support break out

--- 帖子 #457 ---
weekly need a candle that refuse to make new high above 2010 high then we have point 4 and for a full 123H we need to go below Dec 2009 low.....it will take u 1-2 more weeks to get some clear picture on EU long term so just follow the small tf and take ur cake...

--- 帖子 #458 ---
from here u cant see anythung but since weekly close as pin bar we would retrace up base on pin bar rules and drop down ..so if we dont make a new high above last week candle and we make new low below dec 2009 bar we have complet 123..new low is what eu need now ..you should understand..my battery is running down so i will complet the analysis when i am on charged.

--- 帖子 #459 ---

Hi all EUROGBP 240 M TF i'm waiting for short entry ????

EG is 1 pair i hate most in my life......if i may say anything on GJ yes it will drop but base on the 139.20 is not broken and followed by new lows each time it test that price and weekly close above 139.20 support we may go back up to test 143 support that turn resistance..but i am bearish on it for now..some people only think that because GJ bounce from 139 the other time and rise over 1000pips so something like that may happen again but this is new year and different data coming in so i will be caution.. i still have a short of 144.30 i may decide to close it when market open...still looking for a break of friday high then will long for 200pips target ..cheers.

I also will take part about this lessons "law of chart" ...

--- 帖子 #517 ---
On posting 259 u have marked congestions. My question is how did you avoid trading these RH and 123H patterns without knowing it would become a congestion? What is the technique or method which helped you to wait for a breakout ? Would really appreciate if you can mark the candles which helped you to stay away from the market? Please help I am sure all fellow traders will have the same question in mind? As you know hindsight drawing trends and ranges is a easy! Please help Thanks

--- 帖子 #518 ---
there are times you will be in a trade before congestion occur and there are times u will see congestion before taking a trade .. there is no way you will know when congestion is about to happen cus todays market could be different from tomorrows market. when you have 11-20 bars not making new low or high after forming 123 low or high. but when the bars are more than 21 or more then u are in a range just watch the highest bar or lowest to break to any direction and trade the Ross hook for RH to form here on this chart price need to break to any direction then test the price and it will form RH for u to be sure the breakout is a good one not shakeout entry at the RH will be safest.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
looking forward then ..Trade safe.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I hear an echo, anyone still trading this or have they all gone to another thread??

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I made my picture of the law of the charts. It is not very beautiful but I will use it, because the market is giving text books examples only occasionally. Here I notice the entry places according to the Law of the Charts. When I read for the first time I found it a little bit confusing but when you plot everything together is it much, much simpler. OK. First we have 1-2-3 formation. This is when we have a down trend and how it transforms into an up trend. The market makes a low (1), then it goes higher (3) and then it fails to go lower than 1 (3). There is a small concern with that conception. The problem is that it is not casual. Look at the 1-2-3 formation when it develops it is analysed as a Ross hook (Rh) but when the Ross hook failes it is analysed as 1-2-3 formation. And that is repainting. Anyway it is still usefull. After that the market goes higher and makes a small correction. This correction is the central concern in the Law of the chart conceptions. The correction is called a Ross hook. And it is something in between trending and quit and trending and volatile in the market states conception. OK. We have one little correction and then another. After that we have exactly the opposite 1-2-3 formation in the opposite formation. The market makes a new high (1), then it corrects (2), and then fails to go higher than 1 (3). After that we have new shallow Ross hooks. You may ask how it is possible a man to call a simple correction in the market by his name. Really? And even more he tells you if the market is not doing the structure you call it by your name it is not your time (or it was something like that). Now please pay a close attention. Yes it is possible to call this correction a Ross Hook because not every correction is a Ross Hook. He defines the rules in his law of the charts in a precise way but what I would like to point is different and it is connected with the market state analysis. You have this kind of analysis when the market overall has the same structure. You need something in between trending and quiet and trending and volatile. This conceptions excludes the stable market states. However look again at the first picture. Yes globally we can say that on a bigger frame it looks like stable and volatile (Anchor) and we have trending and volatile within (Trigger). The anchor and trigger is a very original conception that goes beyond the classical concept of triple screen analysis. The key of the success using this i the correct interpreation of the current market state. For Forex it is imporant to try to make your entry when you are in a period of increased volatility, Eurpean and London open and the New York open. The idea of Joe Ross for Forex is that you do not have to stay in front of your monitors all day. Just try to grab some pips for two hours and get out and do something else. You do not have to spent many hours at the fron of your screan to be a day trader. There is however something more. Sometimes and occasionally the market is giving some big opportunities. And it is important to be there and cash in. I remember the particular moments from the bear market in the Euro. This kind of market is very well trades with the Joe Ross conception. And that is why when I hear for major problems in the Euro zone the speculator within me is happy. What I mean that in my experience the approariate conditions for the law of the charts is when we have a bear market in the Euro. The bull market is much more jagged. And finally the Hurst Exponent is determing the probability of success of the Law of the charts trading method. The larger the exponent the probability of success is bigger. http://fxhackers.blogspot.com/2011/1...-analysis.html

busy with life .sorry i havent post in a while..

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Thank you for the comments. I had some mistakes at the numbering but still it is possible to correct. The idea is that the fractal dimension can be a market state indicator for the Law of the Charts. That is due to the fact that the Law of the charts is not a fundamental market pattern. But it is a specific market condition that allows you to cash in. There is another indicator. It is market sentiment indicator. In fact look if the big price action threads are busy. If they are really busy that means that the market conditions are good for them. If they are quit that means that ... nobody is making money being proud to post about. No it is not a joke. I am currently testing that as a pattern. For me the Law of the Charts is the most comprehensible and structured approach for price action.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
wow..you are thinking like me...yes i did studied bill williams method how he uses the fractal and ao..i think the both work perfect..The indicator that i have added to my chart is macd and alligator which is moving average to view the market momentum, i will update later when i have time...i watch 1.2.3 combine with the macd and where it was form on the alligator including timing of when market was opened which should be 1hr after open of london or NY...they are often a fake entries when you trade at the first open market..

This is not base on the indicator but indicator is used to confirm if the 1-2-3 high or low is good to be taking at where they are formed..

It is an interesting idea to combine the Bill Williams trading ideas with price action. I mean the price action is really nice to time in the entry. And it is nice to have a slow filter. As far as I know Joe Ross in his most recent papers about Forex recommends only the Stochastic for filtering his patterns. Here I allow me to show an Oscillator of a new type. Unfortunately I cannot share here for copyright reasons. I have been banned already for thinks like that.It is my mod but depending on the work of others. In fact this is my mod that combines end - pointed Singular spectrum analysis and the double smoothed jurik filter. As you see it allows to see some divergences that are not observed with the normal MACD. It is just a tool but a good tool. I can share of course but only peer to peer. PM if someone is interested.

...Joe ross state if he's in a trade he enter for a rules and his risk and he exit with same rules and believe opportunity will come again.

He has some course for only Forex (Day Trading Forex). It looks like for Forex he uses somewhat different rules. I agree with his idea to trade only the most volatile moments of the day. "Some traders are comfortable risking $100/contract. Others have no problem with $1,000, or $5,000, etc. For the examples that follow, I use $150/contract as the minimum I am willing to risk, and $210/contract as my maximum personal risk tolerance. The second kind of risk you must be aware of is the risk in the market. To assess that risk, I use an indicator called “Average True Range (ATR).” There are a number of variations of ATR around, but the one I use is the original study developed by Welles Wilder. It has worked for me for years, and I’m not one to fix what “ain’t broke.” The number of bars I use for the ATR is 20. The ATR tells me how much money I can expect to get from a move in prices. It also dictates where I place my stop. Furthermore, ATR guides me in choosing the time frame from which I will trade EUR/USD. In summary, ATR is used to: �� Set my stop �� Set my objective (s) �� Dictate my time frame I set my objective and stop based on the highest ATR of the last 24 hours. I will not trade any time frame over 15 minutes/bar. I believe I have to see at least $150 of risk (volatility) in order to make my minimum objective of $100/contract on 15 lots. If risk is higher than $200, my objective will be ½ my risk." citation from Joe Ross Trading Forex However the 15 lots seems too much for me. For example if the higher reading of the ATR is .0016000. Multiplying .0016000 by the size of the EUR/USD contract ($100,000), I get $160.00. That amount fits within the Joe Ross risk tolerance. He will risk $160 on the trade for 1 lot. There are two shots explaining his approach
