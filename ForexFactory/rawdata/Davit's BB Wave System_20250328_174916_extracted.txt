Disclaimer Trading is risky and you are responsible for losses and gains. Hi Guys Decided to share how I trade.Few things about me.I was a degenerate sport gambler for 5years betting from collage hoops,football,baseball mostly.I would be up one week in thousands and be down next week in thousands.Had no real understanding of % wagered vs account size until I lost all my money.Stopped completely.As faith would have it I somehow end up trading forex.Made all the rookie mistakes blown few accounts and my 3rd year finally started to make money. Before I continue I like to emphasize knowledge and experience are important.Reading trading books helps on weak areas specially on psychology subjects like unable to take a small loss and letting it to become massive loss,unable to let profits run,moving stops etc. This is critical because without work on one's self no system irregardless of profitability will make you money because you are dealing with not just the market but your own demons Some books worth reading 1.All Market Wizards books by JACK D. SCHWAGER (This is to open your eyes what is possible in Trading) 2.REMINISCENCES OF A STOCK OPERATOR (Read it twice 2nd time got lot more out of it) 3.Harmonic Trader by Scott Carney (anything by him) 4.Bird watching in Lion Country by Dirk du Toit (implemented lots of ideas from him) 5.Trading in the Zone (classic on psychology of trading) 6.Van Tharp - Super Trader (Even if you absorb 20% of the book you’ll improve by huge margin) 7.A.J. Frost, Robert Prechter - Elliott Wave Theory (must read) System Indicators System details Most know me as classic counter trader and I did well with it however not taking obvious trades going with the trend was a handicap in my view hence I designed 2 system in 1 Trend following and CT 1st Part Trend following This part is based on Raghee Horner's 34 EMA (she has ton of videos on youtube for further knowledge) Simply brilliant concept.Why 34? Well it works best in my view and Raghee's and its a Fib number. Trades are taken when PA is above Wave green color candles and below wave red candles,blue candles are neutral best not trade. 1hr 4hr and daily must be in sink 2nd Part Counter trade daily chart PA inside 2nd 3rd Deviation RSI 70/30 and above WR% above -20 below-80 These are exhaustion levels We will wait for RSI and WR% to hook opposite direction before entering CT trade H4 Daily. This is to assure trend/swing is reversing . This is important since BB and Oscillators can remain OB/OS prolong period of time. When trading with the trend be mindful BB levels for exit the trades 1st TP BB middle level 2nd TP should PA go in your way further other side of BB 2nd 3rd dev Your chart should look like this

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Questions I get a lot 1.RSI WR% Stoch etc can stay OB OS on prolonged period of time. True and this is why following fundamentals are important news releases etc.I have uploaded news indi that always keeps you informed. Keep in mind no system is loss free.I judge healthy system by series of trades not just few dozen. 2. BB can over stretch on strong trend True and that is why system1 allows trend following 3.Stop loss Up to you I trade without hard stop but do have one.Be mindful 20-30 SL will get hit on spikes and this is how brokers make their money. My average profit target is 50-100pips Example of CT trade that even though its inside BB zone but RSI WR% don't agree NOT good to go long See the difference on my 1st chart where RSI and WR% clearly hooking down

--- 帖子 #3 ---
One of the aspects of this system I like is reading the trend correctly. When trend is healthy it respects 50 level on RSI and WR% and by seeing this one can confidently get in. Notice Wave angle, notice how price bounces off 34EMA I am using WR% how creator Larry Williams uses it. Inserted Video Worth watching

Great system and already subscribed!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Nice to see another good system in FF, Thank you for sharing ! Keep it up

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Roman thanks for dropping by.Feel free to contribute whatever you like

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks Dashisiong.This has been evolutionary process for me but things are coming all together. Robust system which allows trend following and Counter trading

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Lot of veteran traders know that I like Harmonics as well. Why is this important? Because Greed and Fear dominate every market and certain patterns repeat. Lets take U/JPY for example Harmonic pattern Now overlaying my template Notice D point is inside BB zone exhaustion level.It just more confluence .Harmonics are not necessary to trade my system but knowledge of Elliot Wave and Harmonics is very useful and that's why I posted best books on these subjects.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Example of recent beautiful drop I have repeatedly sold G/CHF last month every time it got into BB zone with 100% winners over 12 orders. Looks like this is not getting too much attention here.It could be a good thing.I don't have lots of color boxes and don't think one needs them to see what the trend is doing.In my view simplicity of the system is its strength.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi Davit! Nice thread! Could you upload the .ex4 indicators (# Post 1) also in mq4, please? Best regards from Switzerland. FXcube

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Cube thanks for checking it out the news indi and ADR only ex4 file Rest

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Very cool custom fib indicator levels in color and you can hide or allow additional levels or change colors you like How to use Use Meta default trendline and draw a line point A to B Right click on it Change title to Fib1 for regular fib and fibe1 for extension.Notice extension has e.Refresh by clicking different TF and you are done. My template already has this indi included just drop the indicators in right folder. Example

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Davit, Very nice thread! About your counter trend trades, how do you handle it when price continues to trend and your DD is rising. You keep adding positions or get out with a loss? Because not always by the hooking of the rsi/wr the retracement will be big enough and the trend will continue..

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Its a good question. Example I am shorting UJ close to 103 based on my harmonics, fundamentals and my system.I will not close the trades as loss since I know USD strength is not there to push higher but I also have small red trades on UC and that I may close as small loss. CT trades are those who have lot more experience I suggest you focus going with the trend if sufficiently not experienced.. Some trading thoughts My system has tremendous odds in your favor but there will be some losses as well.(no such thing as zero loss system) Results should be judged over series of trades.I measure my success quarterly just like business and so far I am up close to 60% for the year and shooting for over 100. What is beautiful about this system is you open any pair on daily chart and you get all the information about trend strength (degree of trend slope) red,green,blue candles above below 34EMA RSI WR% levels in quick glance you have a solid understanding where price is.This is hard to do with naked chart.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
In my view and chart 1st stop EU is 35 once price gets there I will watch the behavior if it wants to go further up or continue downtrend Euro is clearly depreciated substantially hence I am in frame of mind corrections are in order. I am already long on EU through shorting U/CHF

--- 帖子 #16 ---
hi David, looks very interesting and thanks for sharing in any case... How long are u tested this system if i may? Keep up the good job Venceremos

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Spinoza CT BB part over 3 months over 300trades 78% winning average.Trend following is new and works great in conjunction with CT system regards

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I like to screen so many currency pairs within a couple of minutes at Daily, Weekly &amp; Monthly, and later at H4, H1, M30. Excellent! Marvellous! FXcube

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Current live trades AU long on 4 positions UC short 6 positions U/CHF short 8 positions UJ short 6 positions Out of all the trades UC shorts are weakest and watching that.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanks Cube I am a visual person candle colors, wave with BB lays everything clear what to do or what not to do . Here is an analyses on EA Daily chart. 1 Price is neutral blue candles inside WAVE (no trades recommended) 2.RSI WR% above 50 sharp slope up meaning likelihood of PA going higher is good. 3.PA is not in extreme Dev zone That took me 2min to decide NO trades worth taking

--- 帖子 #21 ---
On the other hand UJ is clear Sell Clear rejection of 103 PA in BB zone RSI and WR% hooking down from OB I can exit with profit now but I think this has further bear legs

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Your system add here some valid &amp; reliable selection criterions. Great stuff, Davit! FXcube

--- 帖子 #23 ---
E/CHF Looking for long only PA most likely reject 50level and bounce up but if it does go below 50 I'll just wait to get in at lower BB zone. Based on my system PA holding and bouncing from 50 level is confirmation of trend strength

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Davit, Thanks for sharing your system, looks very interesting. Can I ask do you mainly trade it from daily timeframe? but only if H1 and H4 are in sync? or are you only worried about them all being in sync if you are trading it off the lower timeframe? - i.e if you take a trade from H1 then you need the confirmation of higher TF. Also how many pairs do you follow using it? seems like maybe a lot? Cheers, Callum

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Great stuff. Subscribed. I am also trading with BB and rsi .

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Would you see this NU as a CT buy opportunity?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Generally moves start at lower TF but my decision to get in almost all time is based on Daily chart I am swing trader hence daily provides best signal. regards

--- 帖子 #28 ---
No I don't like the fundamentals on NZ significant drop in prices of milk and logging 30% of NZ economy I might consider it at 84-83 area Having said this PA could prove me wrong but that's my discretion.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Davit Have seen some of your calls and trades in the past and really like the way you go about trading the the bigger TF's I have been looking for longer time frame system for while and will be following along here with great attention. Wishing you all the best and continued success. Rooi

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Very nice video explaining about the first pull back to level 50 on Williams % indi. I advise those who are following this threads have a watch on this....

--- 帖子 #31 ---
So would this hook on cable be enough to go long, or do you wait for more movement up by the rsi and williams?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Excellent post Dashisiong

--- 帖子 #33 ---
thanks for good wishes and same to you.If you see something worth trading post your thoughts charts. Regards

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Here is my take on GU Based on technicals on my system is good to go long.I am however reluctant to go long GU just yet.I believe it has more legs on bear side. Prefer going long at 67 where previously support was very strong. REgards UPDATE on mY trades UJ short all green +260pips and counting on 6 positions AU long all green +30pips on 4 positions and growing UC shorts -20pips but holding on U/CHF shorts Break even but getting closer to +pips

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Placed limit longs on E/CHF at 2150 2x Notice tight range on this pair 13pips last 20days You are guaranteed to trade without SL on this Notice trend respected 50 level

Curious...why does the alert with no message keeps going off?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
What alert?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Davit I will be Demo trading this at least till the end of the year.Might never trade it live.Who knows.But this is definitely a very nice visual system. I have taken 2 trades(please let me know if they fit in or I dont mind removing it) EURAUD as a continuation of the daily down trend and touching the EMA and w% pull back GBPUSD a counter trend trade on the Daily as it in the BB and might be showing what looks like the beginning of a new 1hr up trend How many pairs do you monitor. PS -I will trade 5 X 0.02 lots and will add as we go along.Really like the way you do it.As the trade progresses we gain more confidence in it. All the best Rooi

My UJ shorts doing great all green Increased the position to 10 shorts RSI WR% pointing down from OB zone and price coming from BB zone

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Davit- did you code your own RSI indicator? Would it be possible for me to get the same, minus the ADR? I really like the red zones for 70+ and 30-...also is it possible to set up alarms/notifications for RSI using the alarm system in mt4? I'm thinking an alarm anytime 90 or 10 RSI is reached.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
No coding I just added rectangles I am sure if you search you'll find RSI with alarm. there is a thread on it and examples http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=10835

thank you

Hi Davit! First I want to say thanks for the system and for all the help. I'm trading following your system and you post a pic and I don't know why you did that. Why you don't open sell positions two hours? I think is a good set up for sell. Looks like you knew the nexts bars. What was my mistake? Sorry for my english. Have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Chart was just to show where trade was taken and closed(look at dotted lines).Not for new positions.Sorry for confusion Regards

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Nice! No doubt the unanticipated flash crash helped !

--- 帖子 #66 ---
TRue however I was in profit at 102.30 already hence crash or no crash I has serious +pips but things working on your way is always welcome

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I think you don't understand my question. I hope this pic solve: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Why you did't open sell position two hours before? (At bar surrounded). Thanks.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Please read the thread beginning how I trade.My trades are all based on DAILY CHART Chart I posted was H1 and it had nothing to do with my trading other then showing closed trades. If you can't figure out what I am doing I strongly suggest not following me or my system.Not personal but everything is in details.Did you read my thread?Well everything is laid out clear. 2nd Part Counter trade daily chart PA inside 2nd 3rd Deviation RSI 70/30 and above WR% above -20 below-80 These are exhaustion levels .When trading with the trend be mindful BB levels for exit the trades 1st TP BB middle level 2nd TP should PA go in your way further other side of BB 2nd 3rd dev

--- 帖子 #69 ---
What target on E/Chf are you looking for? Thinking of adding myself too but already have two long positions.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Good thread... I'd like to see your thoughts on your Journal

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Closed at 58 +120pips

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Closed all E/CHF trades +10pips Don't like my money being tight down on this slow turtle.Not worth trading to me.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I often do.Keep checking the thread

--- 帖子 #74 ---
7 days of trading in August results are same on 2 accounts hence why I always go 2x etc As you can tell from the equity curve 3 losses were so minor that it does not even register.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Dear Davit, Thank you for a very nice chart system. But I'm wondering on what is your setting for the period of your William's Percentage Range?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thanks for all the examples Your thought process is becoming very clear. Would you mind sharing some of your MM views when you have time. Like how much % are you willing to risk on a pair For example : Risk per pair in % What the biggest mental SL you use or do you vary your positions on the pair and its range? Ho do you prefer to split your trade positions i.e 4 X 0.5% per open position? Thank you for sharing your experience Rooi

--- 帖子 #77 ---
My template automatically will set that but its 21 period Played with different settings but 21 gives accurate feed without going unnecessarily extreme jerkiness.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
This is huge subject and can't cover right now in this post. Suffice to say I have trading plan which deals with 1.Position size 2.Stop Loss 3.Number of trades per pair 4.Profit targets Best I can say is SL is budget based not pips. Example you want to buy EU and willing to risk $400 Single lot $1 gives 1pip=400pips 1/50 standard mini account Davide that in 2=800pips Your SL now is 800pips Its up to you how you want to allocate 800pips You could add 8 .5 orders or 4 or 2 Once 800pip is reached trade is taken as loss no second guessing no letting it run thousands of pips. This is based on my trading plan as a swing trader Can't go deeper sorry.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thats great. All I needed to know. Thank you very much. Rooi

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks Davit. I'll give it a shot..

--- 帖子 #81 ---
This is the Key Traditional SL of 20-30pips is losers strategy because its gonna get hit even if you got direction right. Opposition= hedge funds,Banks,Brokers (spiking spread) actively target those stops and you don't want to be the seating duck Key is to trade like they do but smaller scale.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Going long there actually was a very good idea,with buy limit. It was a clear demand on daily candled and you saw how price reacts. Easy pips.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Nice of you to drop by old friend green pips

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Pair I watching now for LONG trade AUD/JPY Still has room on down side but setting up nicely for long 84.50-84 good places Advantage going long on AUD is positive swap Whenever possible buy NZ AUD CAD GU because it pays to wait

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I fully agree and thats why I like your way of trading it. I do have a nice scalping system that I use and it has a 6-7 pip stop but there is a lot of desertion and understanding smaller TF's.That is something completely different though. I like your Counter trend system the most so far but will wait and see how you implement your trend following / continuation trades.At the moment the market is just ranging and your trading accordingly I have seen many traders trade very well with the approach similar to yours but I really like your "system" you have for determining the exhaustion points and entries.Very clear! Rooi

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hello Davit, How do you deal with lower time frames? For example, the AUDJPY potential trade you gave might be ready for a long position on the 4H time frame. Do you ignore lower time frames and only look at the daily chart? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #88 ---
This is good question and needs intelligent answer I swing trade average gain of 70-100pips each trade. I netted over 600pips on UJ shorts this morning If you look at UJ H4 and UJ daily you'll see that max EDGE was on daily What this means best set ups that have maximum edge is on daily. Test it yourself lay my chart over any pair on 1h H4 and Daily and see where swings took place You'll become a convert You might thing H1 H4 trend is exhausted and you want to CT then realize after getting in that you are early most often 50+pips early Daily prevents early bird slaughter

--- 帖子 #89 ---
AUD/JPY Limit long 2x 9450 2x9430

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I got what you mean, thanks for the explanation

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks for your system. I will follow to learn from your chart. I have 1 question to ask about ADR in the top-left corner 1. What's it mean? 2. How to use it ? thanks.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Pattan Every day pairs go certain ADR distance Example AUD travels 46pips last 20days 1pm NY AUD already covered 60pips going up.Going long then would be mistake because it already reached daily ADR and most likely you will have a loser trade. Makes sense right?This of course changes dramatically on high impact news but generally I always look where ADR is..Its a habit now and can't trade without it. Great example was recent dramatic climb on GN 280pips in 1day average ADR of 120pips What followed was over 100 pips correction!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
If you compare ADR and ATR by putting both of them on a Day chart, you will see that ADR is smoother than ATR. Kindest regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thank you for your answer.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
from tis picture . USDCAD pair Do you Think it should be sell or wait ?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
already have 6 shorts on it Friday CAD employment news at 8.30am Could change things. You can add as many indicators as you like but keep in mind TDI is RSI based with MA but lagging substantially hence useless to me.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi Davit, Learning this system and seems those orders were successfully filled.... Can you please advise if TP would be in the 95.6 area? Tks

--- 帖子 #98 ---
would AUDUSD; GBPJPY; EURCHF; EURJPY be good for long now and USDTRY; USDSGD for short

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I expect a small correction in eur/usd.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Didn't expect my positions to be leveled. 95.60 is good number. Will be watching this closely.I may have blundered getting in early. Guys please post any trade that was profitable or not.Its important that this is functional.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Davit and All Here is what I have for now. I am demo trading it on a 3k account and feeling my way through it. You will see I had a Silver and Gold trade that I closed as I decided I the account will be too small to handle metals as well. I have made back some of the losses but red elsewhere. Just working on this for next couple of months.Will try to double the account. I try not to copy Davits trades too much as it defeats the purpose. Will try to update where I am P/L wise everyday GL for today to Davit and All Rooi

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Dear Davit, I am using same image to explain my problem written inside image i.e, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Please help out as ever. Regards, Azfar

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Closed all my U/CHF shorts 3red 3green net +34pips

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Azfar Number 1 thing to remember I always stress of trading small.Reason for that is room for error meaning since market is fluid entity it does not necessarily do what you want it to do hence giving slack helps. You must understand what risk is Its a probability game.Everytime you take counter trade you are in fact going against the main trend hence increasing risk factor. My system comprise of going with trend as well. As I already mentioned on BB CT trade on 1st page BB can expend further like we have seen on Euro hence BB CT trades are not best when PA is in strong trend.For that I strongly suggest going with the trend. As far as AJ I am long and comfortable with some drawdown.In fact I am used to having DD all the time.Its part of how I trade.What I can't tell and nobody can either exactly when price is going to go up.Can't say it but I am confident that in 50 trades I can hit 70+% winning rate. I must also add that counter trading is advance trading requires some mental toughness and plain experiance in price action. Going with the trend is best when new to trading .Having said this AJ is still in uptrend. On my 1st page I have books recommended to read.Please read about harmonics and Elliot Wave. Knowledge of these will give you confidence I am almost certain in 1week you will be all in green on this pair.Getting positive swap helps to wait without stressing. My method is based on swings and swings can last days to weeks.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks buddy for details and clearing concepts........ It will definitely help me out.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Guys let me be frank.I had no reasons to share what I do.Most successful traders don't share.I am sharing because I like FF Trading is complex because you are dealing not the market but your own self Its all about psychology. I have exact trades as Azfar and yet I don't even flitch and based on Azfar's tone he seems already in panic.Got to work on yourself. Got to have the right mindset and attitude.Invest in self education.I provided great books to read. "Trading in the Zone" is a must read if you are serious about trading. I read practically every night about trading.Constantly trying to improve.That's what it takes.If you think you can find a mechanical system and trade to millions without self improvement you are delusional.Please work on yourselves

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Davit and All , I think AJ still down brcause RSI &amp; %R still downward to OS Zone . I think we will wait for RSI turn around first.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Look friend nobody can be 100% correct.Any system will have losers.You must measure success not based on 10 trades 20 trades but hundreds I measure my success in quarterly just like business I had 6 awesome green months this year 1 red month July. In 8 days I got all my losses back from July plus lot more profit for August.When I lost entire July I never doubted my ability.Sometimes market just does not work in your way. Accepting loss as cost of doing business is normal.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I have closed out most of everything I opened this week except for GBPUSD which was taken on a smaller TF and when I re-read your firts post and saw some more examples I knew its not completely how you go about trading this system.Dont think it will happen again. I made a 350 pip loss on gold and silver and have 67 pips currently in the bank in the blue That leaves me with 410pips up from the low of the account with a 170 pip open DD going into the weekend,so far. Not bailing on GU yet,ill be monitoring it till later but dont except much.Like I said its not text book BBwave trade but lets see if I can ride it out @Davit- Hope you dont mind me sharing results Have a good weekend all Rooi

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I did the same.Will look next week.Start a fresh. Makes for a peaceful weekend I suppose

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Please do share results. Keep in mind selecting pairs is important .I don't trade Gold and silver. My results so far are amazing in 8days in August losses are ridiculously minor notice DD .55% !!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Really is great trading. I will follow along and see how you go about your business next week. I will scouting over the weekend to form my "trades of interest" list and what pairs you might identify to have potential.I must form an understanding of it,not just following along with what trades you have.I will try and update as often as possible but will need to focus on my other system more from next week.Just in the mornings.Will have plenty of time for analysis in the afternoon.Anyway. Hope all those pips &amp; Dollars buys you some beer over the weekend

Me too im waiting for for 92.8 to go long

--- 帖子 #125 ---
If you think its gonna get there fine.I have no way of knowing that.Question is Which has higher probability to get hit 94 or 9250 94 right? That's all.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
thanks for your very kind reply.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
since Jan 2014 AJ has not fallen below 93.Why would you think all of sudden it falls 92xx Want to hear your thought process

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Azfar you should be happy in $$ less then 8hrs of our conversation.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
actually i have so much lose in this market and so i just want to take your advice for the better entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Respectable Davit, Today you changed my trading perception which is much more worthy than few $$. I analyzed my weak points in depth and reorganized my A - Z trading plan with self commitment to honor your lessons. My gratitude to you friend. Azfar

Please demo trade until you know what's going on. I have posted books to read and please do read.Relying on me or anyone else is not the right way to learn trading.You must know it yourself. Let me drill this fact. Any competent trader can take average system and make money.Most incompetent traders will take supper winning system and produce losers. This is constant.True in the industry.I have given you structure to learn and rest up to you.There is no short cut. REgards

--- 帖子 #132 ---
you got the right attitude! That's a huge leap forward.

AJ is forming a kind of dragon fly on the daily. Sell-off was clearly rejected on the daily demand area. Your longs will be in good shape probably.

Hello Davit, thank you for sharing your system and experience. Concerning EJ, my chart looks different from yours though I use your template. I have the W&amp;RSI hooking from oversold area but not reaching 50 level yet, with nice divergence. The current candle is a bullish pinbar, and is 75pips from middle wave...So for me it's a good reversal pattern that fulfills your countertrend criteria. I took 2 longs, one at 136.42, and another at 136.67. I think I'm gonna keep the position as I see 100pips room upside. I would appreciate your comment. Kyurem

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Kyurem Slight difference in chart is result of different brokers feeds but difference is negligible Notice how beautifully price rejected from middle WAVE? That's where I am looking to get in should price get there however it can go south earlier hence why 50 RSI WR% is important. This is actually trading with the trend not CT. We are getting back to downtrend on pull back.Most logical way to get in. Regards

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I have applied your CT rule : price action in 2nd-3rd dev + WR% / RSI hooking from -20/30. Do you mean that in such conditions ( clear downtrend and past rejections at middle waves), you would not consider CT, even if your CT rules are met? rgds, Kyurem

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I think your confusion is you think overall trend is up and bear side is CT whereas I think trend is already Bear and shorting is following current trend.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I post another chart with some comments to make it clearer. I think you didn't catch my point. My analysis is : overall trend is down, I took CT LONG on the pinbar. rgds, kyurem

--- 帖子 #148 ---
You are 100% correct. Watch 50level and the Wave to see if there is more bull in current drive otherwise you could take profit and head south and make $$ both ways. Congrats for taking the trade.I had too much going on and missed it.Thanks for posting results.I like seeing others make money

As the week ended I like to self criticize assess performance Over all great return in 1 week however I should of taken GN short at 2000 it was screaming to short. Reasons are many but in plain situation I had way too many running trades 10 trades on UJ alone. Still trade of the week short GN at 2000 I did not take 200 pips drop. Note to traders its not how many scalps you do but being able to unload on great opportunity and make hundreds of pips in one trade. Which brings me back to one of my favorite articles What Crocodiles Can Teach You About Trading

New second Week of August Lets go over how to read charts correctly specially what constitute a trend. Often we hear lot of traders say trend is up or down. Well which time frame? This is critical because getting mixed up here will cost you money. I am going to post charts CHF/JPY for study purpose CHF/JPY Weekly RSI WR% going down

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Monthly Down RSI WR% going down from OB

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Daily UP This is the tricky part.Looking at monthly and weekly its obvious trend is down however daily had major thrust up. Our deduction must be simple daily UP is nothing but impulse correction.My bias is BEAR based on Monthly and Weekly hence If I short here I am actually going with the trend on larger TF Weekly and monthly but counter trading on daily.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Idea is simple to get in on larger TF trend on lower TF dips or rallies This is what banks and institutions do.They unload on dips and rallies.

Hey Davit, I enjoyed studying your system over the weekend..and I do agree with your way of trading because market makers deceive normal traders by setting certain trends for reversals when they are counter trading themselvs. May I ask your list of pairs that you trade? Thank you again

--- 帖子 #174 ---
and the AUDUSD daily chart with bat pattern. Also notice RSI divergence.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi davit, do you have any view on NZD/USD? I am currently flat after it fell through an area of interest around 0.86. I have an old support of 0.8400 which is holding more or less during the last trading days. So if any bulls are left, they should show up. Do you know anything about the fundamental situation? The swap is still juicy, even though RBA was quite dovish before the sell off ... I will just watch, then decide. EUR/USD plan is to sell a retracement at 1.351, then see what happens.

Shaan thanks for contributions.This is my goal guys collective intelligence My view on EG is that it has some room to go up and then Bear trend continuing. Major fundies on UK on Weds which makes me thing EG goes up Mon,Tues then Slam down most possibly late Tues or Weds On daily RSI has room to go up.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I trade everything with 4pips or less spread and avoid exotics that have huge spreads .Not worth paying that spread. Follow along this week and have fun. Regards

Aussie fundies are shit.Check friday data. I posted a lot about this lately.When I said room on upside meant limited room like 20-50pips not hundreds http://www.theaustralian.com.au/busi...-1227016225781 The unemployment rate rose to a seasonally adjusted 6.4 per cent in July from 6 per cent in June, its highest level since 2002, while also beating the US jobless rate for the first time since December 2006. The Australian dollar fell around half a US cent immediately after the data as traders priced in a 50 per cent likelihood that the Reserve Bank of Australia will buck the global trend and cut interest rates in coming months. “The more depressed the labour market is, the longer it will take the RBA to normalise monetary policy,” said Forex.com analyst Chris Tedder. “This is pushing back the market’s expectations of tighter interest rates, thereby making the Australian dollar less attractive,” he added. The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Tuesday it expected recent stability in interest rates to continue. It left its cash-rate target steady at 2.5 per cent, marking 12 months They also downgraded their inflation and GDP numbers for 2014 Overall metals and mining are down and only sector that has potential is housing.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Well, I am not much of a fundamental trader, but I know the Aussie data has not been the best, to say the least. However, when I said overall is still up, I meant A/J. I mean, look at the chart - we are in a range on daily and the recent area is a demand zone that has been validated by PA on Friday. U/J is also at demand and closed bullish on Friday which gives reason to believe in some upside at least. I may be totally wrong here of course, but it looks worth a try to aim for more than 50.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Short EJ 3690 2x Have limit shorts at 37 2x / 3725 2x UJ is struggling to break 50 level if fails will short that as well

--- 帖子 #192 ---
davit, I assume this trade is on the 1HR and the 50 level trade on daily? is this correct?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
No Trade is based on daily 50 level however I noticed PA struggling to break 37 hence got in early for possible PA running south without me. To me I already made the decision to short at 37 so 10pips difference means little to me.I often do this.My lots are small for that purpose.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Davit I've put some longs ~0.92769 yet by monitoring CCI14 daily pos. divergence. (0.9236-0.94175 range seems interesting for me). Monthly could go further down. FXcube

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Cube glad to see you here Friday Aussie data was negative and I am not touching this until further down..There is talk of interest rate cut.Commodities down,metals down,mining weak. Overall I don't see good reason to buy Aussie. 60% retail long on AUD....that should raise red flags...65% long on UJ another red herring REgards

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Just want to share my idea of support /Resistance Its rather overused terminology but truth to me is rather simple. 1.What moves Price? Sellers and Buyers 2.Where do they place their stops? 3. 00 50 00 4.Which means 20pips above/ below price fluctuates and this is why price rarely stops exactly at RN but goes further 20 pips down gets all the stops then bounces up therefore to me S/R goes like this 80-00-30-50-80- 00 Don't even have to place any S/R indi or draw them.Its always there at those numbers.This also triggers limit orders mostly at RN and 50 Between limits and stops price moves from one station stops/limits to next. Its given some numbers are more important for example EJ at 1.3580 hit massive longs and propelled price over 100pips in short time.This is why I don't talk about S/R's Notice EU is having difficulty breaking 3380/Why 3380 and not 3390 or 34 even...Once again most place their orders at those numbers. People over think S/R in my opinion one of my friends has hundred lines all over the place....not nassary

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I agree they are nuances but for most part markets all markets move from distribution to accumulation and that cycle is based where people place their orders. Majority of traders don't place orders on add numbers but instead place on whole numbers. True some numbers hold more significance but that's easy to see on the chart like end or beginning of major swings. I do agree many ways to skin a cat

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Agreed 100%. And like one of your very astute posters here said, those numbers you posted are zones or areas and perfectly fine for targeting entries and TP's. As swing traders, we do it all the time. Don't let my rather in-depth study of PA structure be a pain here folks. That's just me being me when it comes to details. In 8 of 10 cases, it means very little to the average profitable trader.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
That's better! You had me worried there for a sec.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I can't sell CAD VS CHF (Euro) To me Euro fundies are shit compare to CAD.No trade for me because I see brighter future for CAD I have massive position on UC short so I could be slightly biased. Lets see Ukraine crises less revenue for EZ and Russia just stopped import food from EZ Fish,Beer exporters already in pain. Inflation down and Draghi may start QE Overall Euro is weak and could get lot weaker

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Understood. Just another view here CAD/JPY (sorry about my lines)

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I like that a lot.Wait stalk and sell (Going with the trend ) 50level should be good place but could break and flip on other side of BB so Price Action at 50 must be watched to get a feel.

Is there any other way? Well... yes. CT swings but not on this one. Yep, I still have 3 unmet targets below. But in all honestly? I don't know if she has the legs to get much higher. Been thinking of scaling in on this one. That RSI just "might" bounce off the 50 bottom here. That's a very weak looking daily pin there too and not a very good location. Still watching and waiting though.

Made very good pips so far this month on this pair.Despite of popular belief 70-80% of Forex is in a range.Identifying it is an edge all by itself Difference is you think it sucks and I think great lets pile the pips.

Depending on how many pips one is going for… we really don't know what's going to happen here with NZD it's proving to be the weakest right now, however in the immediate term it is clearly oversold. I am looking for 8434 there…... GU also seems likely to be supported at 1.6760… we shall see what London brings us. But whatever I'm saying you should probably do the opposite

--- 帖子 #277 ---
To me if you find a good opertunity its better doubling up on that 1 pair then have 2 different pairs for sake of diversity. I often hammer good opertunity when I see it like I have 4 orders on UC 4 Orders on EJ 4 Orders on UJ and most likely hammer UJ even more.Don't need 12 different pairs when I can squeeze most from 3 or even 1 I am a swing trader but my system can be adapted for day trading as well. NZ fundamentals are weak.Weak milk / logging prices 30% of NZ economy.I think RBNZ made a premature interest rate hike whereas their neighbor Aussies are thinking to cut theirs. I won't be surprised NU declining lot further.Massive housing bubble developing in China they literally built entire cities without anyone living in them and their economy is slowing down.Its bewildering how careless RBNZ has been.This is the time when everyone wants lower rate to grow and NZ bankers are shooting themselves.I am not an expert on economy but if my neighbor is slowing down and my biggest trading partner (China) is slowing down then why would you raise rates?Its just stupid

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Yes agreed. I can see UCAD going a lot higher but in near term seems we have some bearish technicals and I expect pair to head below 1.09.

EJ chart Since kind of slow lets look at EJ Swing stopped just at 50 then slowly RSI WR% pointing south.All the criteria looking to take the trade Weekly Chart is making lower Lows hence by all definition shorting EJ is going with the trend And what do they always say? Trend is your friend

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Closed EJ at 47 + 140pips on 4 positions

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I bagged some short on the EJ on my scalping account account as well Great trading

My Daily update Long EURUSD Long AUDUSD Short USDCAD Short GBPNZD Long GBPUSD ( 340 pips open DD for now from last week ) Long NZDUSD Pendings long on AUD JPY 500 pip open DD at the moment , mostly from GBPUSD 115 pips in the blue. Still happy with everything I have got for now,lets see what NYO brings Good Luck to all Rooi I agree with Davit,no point in copying his trades and not learning how to trade properly,anyway

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi Davit Thank you for sharing your system, I will practice with it with a small account, are their any other reasons for going short on UJ other than RSI is flat and the move up seems to be running out of steam? Thanks Logic38

GU is getting close to rebound While EU is getting hammered GU is holding on firm suggestion of Bear exhaustion. Big fundie day tomorrow on UK,We may see serious up thrust.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I agree , will have to see what happens tomorrow. Still have one pending waiting - will close basket of trades if I am down $100 ( 1000 pips) as that's just over 3% of account and my limit for "pain" Like I said in previous posts,strictly speaking it was an incorrect trade according to your rules but I might just average out of it otherwise I will have to take it on the nose for my mistake Do you check in every 4hrs or so? 24hours a day ? 6 times a day?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Please study little about price movements in general.I posted good books to read on harmonics. What I drew does not mean that's what is going to happen for sure but very likely.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I actually posted the chart why it was early to long.Its fine.Mistakes are necessary part of trading.Just make mental note to analyse so you can prevent same mistake happening again.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
In my simple way of thinking RSI WR% stopping at 50 level after a huge swing suggest "reaction" time (Corrective wave) is over hence most likely direction would be previous strong swing. Price travels least path of resistance.If it stops and can't or does not want to go up then it either goes into small range or break opposite side. Its just probability factor.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Very good way to focus on good trading habits getting in at the right time and also getting out at the right time In the "Playbook" written by the Mike Bellafourie from SMB Capital he talks about writing and drawing trade setups like those in your pictures so you can see what makes the most sense for you to trade - each to their own. Everyone will have setups they like the most.I have read most of the books you have posted on page 1.Makes a big difference.Anyway ( http://www.amazon.com/The-PlayBook-I.../dp/0132937646 ) I have and will in future.I added positions to quickly as well. Like you said.So we we learn

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Rooi You got potential to make it in this business.Keep it up.Its a slow arduous process but you got the right attitude. I love trading and reading about traders is a pleasure.Thanks for the book suggestion.His name sounds very familiar I think he was featured on market wizard book.

Thanks I'll watch it My day off today

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Still making some nice pips though

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Just want to share trading "wisdom" Some traders say everything is in the chart and I disagree with this. Some follow fundamentals only.I think my approach is most natural that I follow both.We got news releases everyday shaping price as we go. Its your job as a trader to scan all red news dates and factor your trading around it.Do you want to be wrong side of GDP,NFP.Interest Rate,Major Unemployment ? Obviously no so keep up with news.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks Rooi but day off from my real crappy job.I am not yet full time trader but that's my objective

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I still have a J O B as well,working towards the same end goal.There is some hurdles to overcome but all in time.I always say it is inevitable.Might take a bit longer than originally planned but will get there.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Yes. Im already "in". 2 x short from 0.9100 2 x pending order from 0.9150 trying to figure out where to put SL :-) Let see.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Zolo welcome good entry.Watch EU as well since its flip of U/CHF On SL be aware 20-30pips is almost like seating duck. Your own broker could even take out by simply widening spread in mini second. Just monitor it without hard stop but keep the number in your head where you may want to get out.If this makes you nervous then your position is too big. Added 2 more on UJ at 19 total 6 orders on it

--- 帖子 #308 ---
So am I.Sort of.Long on the EurUSd

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Short U/CHF 92 2x This is more of short term trade since I believer overall EU is heading possible lower in coming months.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Closed 81 +20pips

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Killed my EU for 18 pips as well about 20 min ago.Still have a pending there.Asia might just run stops to the downside tonight and activate some longs for me again.Will see GU trying to claw its way up again.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Scalping!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
boredom Someone said I only need to make 20 pips a day to get rich. Well I made 1,556 pips so far this month.I guess I covered next 4months

--- 帖子 #314 ---
ha. That's applicable if you're using 500x leverage I suppose

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Well, it also depends by your starting capital...the more money you have, the less overleverage you can use to live well with also few pips per day. As they say: money makes money

--- 帖子 #316 ---
agree and also want to add higher lots carry bigger pressure thus effect trading psychology.I trade smaller because I know one is seldom correct on exact entry hence smaller lots allow room for error. If you go large lot for 20pips then your SL must be small as well.That combo is stress loaded.Not kind of trading I like to do.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi Davit, was following your system for quite some time, also read one of the book you posted with title "Davit's philosophy" from Mark Douglas, am new, been trading 3 months now. Current trades EU short mostly because its long term going down and swap charges are positive. UC short because I think CAD might get a little stronger in some time as Crude oil prices go up in case Iraq crisis heats up. AU short because Chinese and NZ is going lower lately and AU might fellow its neighbours, also AU will act as a hedge for UC in case dollar gets stronger. I don't understand why would UJ go lower more than 30-50 pips from 102.20. JPY doesn't move too much and USD seems neutral atm.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi A on UJ explanation on the chart. Just want to add I take most signals I get and I let it play out.System should be measured based on series of trades say 100 and out 100 I expect 20% losers. So far I am above 80.If UJ is a loser then be it but I don't know that unless I take the trade. Mark Douglass talks lot about this in his book "Trading in the Zone" "Edge is defined on series of trades" Good trades but be mindful of AU and NU are "due" to rebound higher.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
added 2 more on UC 942 total 8 shorts

--- 帖子 #320 ---
thanks about AU I did this a lot while I practised on demo with UJ. Starting with both Sell and Buy order in and around the same levels at 102. Sell order TP 101.30 with BE after 101.50. Buy order TP same with 70 pips profit at 102.70 with BE at 102.50. Most of the time i was able to close both trades within 2-3 weeks both in profits. Don't have a heart to try that in real account "yet".

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Davit, I'm back from another break and I'm gong to start trading faster time frames (daily swing trading for the most part) now that volatility appears to be returning to the markets (or adding to my longer-term positions should volatility not continue to increase) and I'd like to overlay your system with mine and compare triggers, but going back to the beginning of this thread and back to the beginning of June in your other thread (which is a month before you posted your current Metatrader extensions) you've never posted the actual values you're using (other than 34 EMA and what I can see on your chart). Since I don't use Metatrader I was hoping you'd post them so I could apply them to my own charts where possible.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi Davit, Do you attention to candlestick patterns or just waves price action only? Rgds Kyurem

Ok bro! Just demoing with you guys. Here are a couple from yesterday's close. ( at 0 GMT on this account). That give me a 2 hour Sunday candle... which is significant on an 8-rsi window. CAD-JPY...

Been waiting all day for my short on EJ to do something. but trickle up.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hello Davit, you have the EMA34 with high low close on your template, just for trend determination the close would be enough. i found no direct rule, but it seems to me you are using the high and low in relation to RSI 50 level for trend following trades or is there another reason?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
RSI above 50, W% above 70 USDCHF -99% correlation with EU keep an eye on both http://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/correlation/USDCHF ​

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi Thodie When price is inside Wave No trade blue candles unless it bounces off and breaks out of Wave Basic idea is not making mistake of taking false entries and staying on sideline if price stays inside WAVE 50 level is either taking profit or if it goes your way letting profit run to other side of BB and RSI 70/30 WR% -20/-80 Let me know how it goes.I am very interested to see your results If I had just single EMA close that would of not achieved as far as zone.I like the width of EMA giving space hence eliminating otherwise false entries.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Snip I am so glad you are paying attention and making money. You are ON I am assuming you went long since price did not break 50 level confirming trend is strong in direction that has been going If true your entry is spot on! perfect actually

--- 帖子 #339 ---
thanks i´ll do! for now i have only compared the ribbon bollinger to the MT4 OEM, there is a slightly difference with the same settings in ranging periods, so i´ll use the build in ones. so far i have a question about additional positions, any criteria on that? i notice sometimes you add pendings on countertrend, sometimes it seems they are manual in nearly the same range as the initial position are the pendings based on the ADR? regards thodie

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I usually place pending in BB levels should price get there while I am sleeping or not at the computer.Example I have UJ 2x at 102.90 just happens to be pivot point S/R without even looking at that but I know it is based upon Price reaction there previously. It does not matter OEM BB or Ribbon.Both are fine.I used profitably both. As far as adding new positions.When the trade goes in my way I add additional positions.I also add additional positions even if my original orders are red .Not recommending this to others but that's part of my trading plan scale in even if some orders are red. Regards

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi J Your entry short on EJ was early.Look at RSI it did not even got 50 level.You had no reason to short when you did. I do think PA will most likely resume downtrend

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I have been watching volume bars privately a lot lately and things become clear what big money is doing Notice on NU every huge volume bar is Bear candle.This is clear that big money is not supporting NU at this levels My only deduction is there is no interest buying NU since all Bull candles are tiny volume bars.Not incorporating volume yet but its something I always have been interested. I used to think tick volume is not real volume but I came to conclusion that its pretty close. On H4 same biggest drop candle is Red Bear bar on volume from 50 level I must confess RSI 50 level is amazing.Its the perfect guide ,a campus to guide in turbulent sea.It works most TF

Buying - Was really the wrong time for buying or selling where I entered. Was completely wrong about it. Here is is on a 1 hour TF which I took the first two trades on then I re-read your first post and saw only the daily PS- First two trades would have worked if I took the profit but was greedy and early

--- 帖子 #354 ---
AJ waisted a lot of steam to get there, and rsi also left a lower low promise at the lows, any type of divergence at this point could turn it south...Soorry about the extra lines

--- 帖子 #355 ---
You should of moved SL to BE minimum 1st trade but you let it come down and you turned a profit trade into a loser. Its common and this is why I highly suggest reading "Trading in the Zone" and practice solid trading habits.Your biggest enemy is you not the market.Psychology of trading is critical specially how you view money.People who enter in trading "I just want to make loads of money" will fail mostly because they are too emotional about money.They will hang on to losers until account gets busted because taking a loss would be emotional giant pain. Correct way is to love trading and focus making good entries and good trading habits.Money will come.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I agree - I am currently re-reading it

--- 帖子 #357 ---
AJ is in a range. PA can go above 50 level to other side of BB There is nothing to confirm shorting.I like to see RSI hooking down.At this point swing is up. PA also can turn around and go south but if you take the trade and be profitable its gonna teach you wrong way of doing it and next time same situation comes up you might get your but whipped up. I rather lose a trade correctly entered then lose a trade knowing it wrong entry to begin with.

--- 帖子 #358 ---

Hi W Statistically roughly 5% traders make it.Guess which 5% do.Not picking on you but taking the opertunity to drill this hard To be successful in anything requires certain qualities. Guess where this is coming from Choose and maintain a positive attitude. Maintain a high level of self-motivation. Set high, realistic goals. Deal effectively with people. Use positive self-talk. Use positive mental imagery. Manage anxiety effectively. Manage their emotions effectively. Maintain concentration. Please read the book.Worth it

For CT generally no but for going with the trend 1h 4h D fine. Reason I don't like CT on lower TF because move that looks exhausted on 1h isn't on h4 and same for daily. Perfect example AJ looked great to short at 9510 H1 but kept going higher now its 9530.On my daily chart RSI pierced 50 level suggesting further bull gains. You see I just saved money by not taking a loser. Going with the trend is different.You are "continuing" what has been established already By the way I noticed you are trading multiple different systems including mine. You know the saying " Jack of all trades , master of none "

Never hedged but can't anyway because of US regulations. Works on pairs that go into a range but if it trends strongly then you are just collecting DD from one end not sure if it ever will come down level you hedged.. My thinking is simple.Either your timing and entry is correct or not.

Hello Davit, First i want to thank you for inspiring me and so many others. I like your method, your book recommendations. I have been following this thread now for some time and most of my demo account trades were closed in profits and only today i went on real account and there are some trades i would appreciate your comment... is it too early to go on long or should i wait for the hook? Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi FX Glad that I could be any use and generally I had no need to start this thread if it were not guys like you. All GU pairs are in a limbo. Better to wait a little to get a confirmation that correction is taking place then be early and collect DD One advise if I may. If you are new trading specially live account GN GJ GA are beasts to trade.Look at those daily ADR's they are almost double that of GU. I rarely touch those.I rather trade a pair which has 50-60ADR .Making a mistake there is relatively painless but making a mistake on GN could cost you 150pip. Having said this its up to you I can only share from many traders experience and mine. Regards 316 pip drop on GN in 1 day!!! I am already long on G/CHF through shorting EG which is flip side of G/CHF (CHF is -99 correlation with Euro)

#395 Hi Davit! Why are you going in the risk when monthly could start a breakout upsides...? Couldn't it be more qualified under these market environment (e.g. monthly candles are shaping an ascending triangle) trading the AUDNZD only long and wait now if the market price is struggling on your chart exclusively at the lower lines and go then into the market when the price is going there more downside? (My weekly chart also would say me a CCI negative divergence which also means "going short". But there're only indis, not more...Signals from indis shouldn't be hard rules). Best wishes from Switzerland! FXcube AUDNZD, Weekly, 2014 August 14

Cube thanks very much for feedback I must respond to my system signal After 1700pips so far this month I feel its my trusted friend (system) Having said this your comment reminded me what Mark Douglas said in "Trading in the Zone" 3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge . If every loss puts you that much closer to a win, you will be looking forward to the next occurrence of your edge, ready and waiting to jump in without the slightest reservation or hesitation. On the other hand, if you still believe that trading is about analysis or about being right, then after a loss you will anticipate the occurrence of your next edge with trepidation, wondering if it's going to work. This, in turn, will cause you to start gathering evidence for or against the trade. You will gather evidence for the trade if your fear of missing out is greater than your fear of losing. And you will gather information against the trade if your fear of losing is greater than your fear of missing out. In either case, you will not be in the most conducive state of mind to produce consistent results. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. What above means based on my results if I take 100 trades I will roughly get 80wins 20 losers But I have no way of knowing which trade taken according to my system rules is a winner or loser.That's the random factor of any system not just mine. REgards

Hi All GU Update The market took bearish mode for last 3 weeks now as an indication that predictions of an interest rate rise later this year or early next year were too optimistic. Though i still firm beliver that BOE will be the first one to raise the interest. The fall in the pound yesterday was justified as the outlook for interest rates became a little bleaker. Looking further I have many reasons to remain optimistic for pound and the bullish sentiment is sure to return. Yesterday news was not all bad at all. and it gives me even more hopes that there will be uptrend starting soon ... "What did not make the headlines was that the Bank of England upgraded their estimate for economic growth this year from 3.4% to 3.5% and its 2015 forecast was lifted from 2.9% to 3.0%. Furthermore the BoE believed the amount of spare capacity in the economy narrowed to 1.0% from 1-1.5%. This should give anyone bullish on the sterling cause to hope that these good figures will eventually feed through to wage and CPI inflation. We cannot overlook the good result for unemployment also released yesterday. The headline rate fell from 6.5% to 6.4% and the claimant count fell by -33,600 vs an estimated fall of -30,000. Adding more optimism was the fact that the BoE’s medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment was reduced to 5.5% from 6.5%." Good luck

Hi Davit Thanks Bro I wish i can send more analysis but shortage of time restrict me .....anyways this thread is a good initiative from you ... many new comers are learning from u I am sure ..... Remember always ... Sharing your knowledge will always increase your knowledge even further n sharpen ur skills.... regards

Hi Davit Thanks for that.So much better. I agree.Better to take the small loss early rather than "gambling" and hoping the news will be in my favor. With all the positions I had open I would be down - 600 pips and counting Hope we can continue on this path Rooi

I wouldn't, rather a good chance to short EU atm for 50-60 pips, EC will take lot of time to move up even if it does go up.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
It's at the resistance from the end of June now (0.80350) and short-term RSI is oversold so this might be a better level for you to short from. I've got low confidence for the long term, but from a swing perspective with the drop the Pound took and using just Fib and RSI I'd say a retest of 0.80 within a couple of days is reasonable. 2nd estimate GDP is the only upcoming data that should affect this pair until next week so there shouldn't be any surprise movement. A short entry back at 0.8035, stop at 0.8040 and target 0.8000 gives a 7:1 reward to risk ratio. However, I'm in the middle of reviewing tech stocks and deciding whether or not I want to put a high-yield dividend player I dumped in spring back in the portfolio so I haven't placed this order personally yet but I probably will. Update : EUR/GBP dropped faster than expected. I regret not placing an order -- the stocks could have waited.

The Swiss bank won't act until it gets to 1.2 but it might be worth taking a poke at a long from just a bit further down at 1.21 and hope for a similar reaction to 1.21 as there was at the beginning of March. Otherwise this pair can be an excruciatingly slow mover that you don't want to have your capital tied up in.

Thank's for your answer, Davit! Best wishes from Switzerland! FXcube

Hi Davit. My first possible BBwave counterswing trade... is it AU long at the end of the day (if not moves up too much during this last few hours), a good choice in your opinion? Or just countertrend trade not triggered cause price already above the grey low BB band now that stoch pop up from hot low zone? (price no more inside the two low bands grey and aqua, and also already touched the low band of the price channel). Hoping the question is not so dumb..just started to take confidence with this system..

--- 帖子 #453 ---
It's live account but will open demo with Oanda or MBtrading to compare the charts. tks for continuous support

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi Cariddi RSI at 50 level which then 2 things happen either it breaks on other side of WAVE BB's or Turns around resumes the main trend which has been down for a while Most likely scenario it will break 93 go south again but market is king. By the way your price is on wrong currency.I suggest upload my template again. And black line is not Stoch but WR% although they are very similar Good trade by the way.I should of done the same....

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thank you! I am a fan of Eitan methods mostly, but i think yours can really be the integral complement to them. I now try to master your way to use your systems firstly, of course... and then i will try to mix with the ones that i already use and have mastered already making me now, pips everyday, consistently. I like to experiment Great thread anyway..so much "action" and feedback!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Do what makes you money.Simple as that.To me its very important that I am not LATE to the trade. Example your AU you took at the start of the move whereas lot of Box systems that would of been no trade. Most color box systems lag substantially and by the time all line up red or green 80% move is done.This is because most red green boxes are based on MA's which always lag behind price. Anyway I like taking Trades that are not "dated" Regards

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Yep, you touched the point. I like the small/no drawdown of Eitan systems and the early entrance of yours. That's why i will try to combine them in a new super system...one step at time...now back studying your systems! :nerd:

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Congrats Davit, great system! have coded the countertrend basic trigger logic with your given levels, just to get an idea and tested it on USD/JPY from 1.1.14 as you already noticed it would probably fail during heavy fundamental trends. The only change was a forced exit at the EMA34. modeling quality of the backtest isn´t good with 51% but i would give a damn about ticks on a daily TF

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Thanks for sticking to one simple system that works, not changing it weekly and helping us focus on mastering it.

Today Euro Bank Holiday.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
could be a nice set and forget EA on non correlated pairs

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Though I haven't used your system to initiate any actual trade yet so consider this as me just thinking out loud here, a visual backtesting of your system across nine pairs and gold suggests certain pairs have more definitive signals on the 8-hour chart or the weekly than the daily which I suspect reflects the degree of individual currency volatility and I wonder if a percentage change or volatility study could automate shifting up or down from the daily timescale to get the best trigger readings.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Thodie Impressive results 5 wins zero loss.I guess I must of stumbled something worthwhile. Thanks for your efforts

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Since you posted AU has been gaining Are you still on this trade?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi KADC I got plenty of signals this month in 10days of trading (excluding weekends) Daily provide lots of entries.Weekly signals are significantly lagging.I just don't see any purpose other then confirm overall trend. Demo the signals you get and see how system performs. I have to stress that CT is one part of the system however it also contains solid follow the trend system as well. I personally trying to find more trades that agree with overall trend. Regards

Watching AJ still some room up Actually regret missing this when it was 94 Going long on AJ with positive swap would of been ideal.

Hello davit i see 15 pips room there for go included spreads (touching the yellow line ). After 15-20 pips please watch a power and don't fight with reversal signals for friday, Maybe next week it can go up but today we can see some corrections

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Thanks Roma for feedback.According to me system rules its early to CT RSI WR% not in OB and price not in my BB zone. Check this out I was thinking why EU stopped dead on 3360 area then found this Weekly 50% and B point on harmonic pattern on left 2013 I am inclined to go long but not pulled the trigger yet

--- 帖子 #473 ---
This is very good opportunity for going long this is my monthly breakout and very powerful one Price supported exactly from %25 line before breakout red one, Trend indi loosing power with adx.. and two doji's i see in daily. This is very good opportunity to build longs on dips. Just my two cents, And today we will see some daily breakout for longs probably.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Only reason I am hesitant are fundamentals. There is talk about Draghi pulling a QE Nothing is performing well on EZ.Low inflation.high unemployment,Italy falling apart,Germany under performing. Enough reasons to make me pause supporting Euro now. There was an attempt for 34 but quickly got killed even under negative unemployment news day. H1 chart shows aggressive stop hunting.Killing both bulls and Bears Break out Bulls got smashed and Bears placing orders at 3370 area got killed too.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Very good point here! As soon as the yields drop and or the balance sheet stops increasing crazy like it is now, say goodnight to EUR, either EURUSD or EURJPY short is the place to be!

I have been trying H4 tf with same entries as Daily today. The entries have been good, but not sure about the exits, i have just closed keeping an eye with some +pips.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice I did not say anything about CT We are just waiting to get on "going with the trend" Since both systems kind of complement each other CT trade could of taken When RSI WR% was hooking up from 30RSI -80WR% System allows taking advantage from going with trend and CT. Discretionary part is what one wants to do.If pair is strongly trending then all we are looking is going with the trend until it exhaust itself and RSI WR% BB help locating exhaustion levels. As A trader if I see very strong trend such as GU going down then I'll be looking to short on rallies or stay short until RSI WR% clearly suggest trend has reached exhaustion. My choice would of been Short side hence going with trend.In this context I am not fighting it but trying to get on.

Rooi Excellent work.I want to give you props for taking the loss on GU.In retrospect your entries going Long on GU was not confirmed hence the losing trade. That is fine taking a loss guys.I take them all the time.It is statistically impossible to have no losing trade. Success of the system or in trading is always about managing risk and profits take care of themselves.Professionals always think about risk amateurs on profits. This is based on my experience and all the top traders featured on Wizards books.

With my random schedule that's not doable. What I prefer to happen good traders posting set ups and analyses and collectively we hammer trades. Serendipity

--- 帖子 #499 ---
What you don't see lots of other system threads nobody posting losses as though every trade is a winner.I highlighted my losses in bold red to drill the point that its part of trading nothing to be ashamed,nothing about your intelligence, nothing about the system. Its a simple probability.Accepting this is critical. Mark Douglass talks incredibility eloquent about this in "Trading in the Zone" "Random distribution of winners and losses" love this.To me its incredibly uplifting.What this means taking a signal according to system has random distribution if its winner or loser. Success is measured over series of trades say 500.As long as you keep losers small you will kick ass.

Not sure if i understand your question, if you put the EA on one chart it will just trade the currency in the chart, so if you want more currencies you have to set all of the currencies. feel free to test it on all avalible symbols the more info we can collect the better! i have setup my tester for 23 symbols. http://www.myfxbook.com/members/thod...ve-test/999236

--- 帖子 #538 ---

EJ very strong possibility of further up gain.RSI above 50 Although Friday was quick dump profit taking (took advantage of that)I anticipate Bull sentiment to continue.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
UJ 50 RSI holds Bull sentiment will continue Will be looking for Longs should PA bounce off from 50 and according to my rules bounce from 50 reinforces that trend is intact and still strong.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
NU Every time PA is at RSI 50 2 things happen rejection bounce or continue direction that it has been coming Most common movement in price is 123 pattern.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Example here what I am talking about 50RSI rejection. AU Will be looking trades on short side unless further price action on opening changes.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
i already showed my view, but i might be affected by my open trades which are long on this pair... on a daily base a retracement is overdue and i like the setting on daily sma200.

Just wanted to add that retrecement is relative in general.I mean if you go to Weekly chart on GU its pretty wide open on Bear side. Plus weekly TL is broken plus larger Harmonic in play I don't rule out 1.62-1.60 I know you are long and don't let me scare you PA could very well bounce up.Just sharing my thought process

--- 帖子 #552 ---
You did real well! Congrats

--- 帖子 #553 ---
no problem with that, we all know market went never in a strait line, for me a 44pip bounce would be enough (if i don´t add more) to exit at BE so even if the retracement is a tini one ~10% it shouldn´t be a problem from todays point of view.

You welcome Jeff See my view on GU page back. To me its no trade unless I get an clear idea on direction.There is plenty of room on Bear side on weekly so its not automatic buy although retail traders are 60% long on it.... regards

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi R I am an artist and to me simplicity and efficiency is most important.I refrain from adding lots of indies because with each indicator you are adding one more variable and to me that does not necessarily add more edge.It could add more decision paralyses Cad/JPY indeed is showing opertunity on short side with RSI WR% pointing down.We will wait to see how it moves on open. Regards

Hi Shaan I went through week analyses page back.I am long bias on UC regards

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I don't trade this pair in general but looks pretty poised to go down further.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
it could very well be paradigm shift on GU after months and months of bull drive regards

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Just want share one of traders explorer here for what NOT to do Please guys if your trades don't work out then get out but don't keep adding to losing position without a clue.There is such a thing called trend reversal. Looks like GU has huge army of traders in massive DD all expected 1.70-74 soon. Maybe but we could also see 1.60-1.58 as well. Total rookie way to trade. Notice that my system clearly defines parameters to have the edge on our side.Nothing is assumed.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
GU has been ranging on Monthly TF for quit some time. This may only be the beginning of another nice Bear run to bottom. If so seems to be a lot of trapped bulls. Time will tell. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Well that's confirming for me, I'm already in EG short. First trade this method (demo)and don't ask me what I'm doing cause I still don't know much which is why the demo and 0.01 lot

--- 帖子 #580 ---
You must also realize any trade irregardless of system, method is just basic probability. This takes the stress out of trying to be correct all the time.My signals tells me to sell however Bank of Japan can unload 10million order next 10 min buying the Euro. There is always that X factor

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi Kmw Nothing wrong with demo trading or trading 0.01 lots when learning about a system BUT Most people fool around and dont take it seriously when there is no real money on the line so try and focus on the demo trading like it is real money Think to yourself what would I feel like if I was up $10 or down $1000 and work through your pain and emotion so that once you trade real money you have good idea of whats what in your emotions

--- 帖子 #582 ---
thanks guys, I've brought my stop at break even now with this pair, That X factor is always the unknown. I have another trade going GU long currently up a few pips, targeting 16 and the stop is set at 10. That trades on ctrader. Just trying to compare tween mt4 and Ctrader. Trying to stay of that close trade button in both as I've got to learn to let those profits run. One fella's coded Raghee Horner"s indicators for Ctrader. I found the indicators there this morning, don't quite look the same but it's okay far as I can see. (jumped out of this one, counter trend and looked shaky, +3 pips on it) Holding GU. (No I'm not, tightened stops and got taken out) +1.16

--- 帖子 #585 ---
======= triggered on da M30 chart by mistake , i'll leave it Runnin --- C whut happen lol = its in Green atm

--- 帖子 #586 ---
in worst case it closes in a loss, the Exittriggers ignore if there is profit or loss, they close. Thats why the account will survive with ot without martingailing... 2 trades so far on my account long GBP/CHF long EUR/CHF i backtest it on the 4h chart too, much more profit but much more DD, i would NOT recommend to trade this system (the Countertrend) ond 4h Chart manually . stick to davit´s rules and you´ll be fine if there are no fundamental changes . So keep an eye out. You can also use this EA just for a "scount" position with 0.01s lot - by setting the maximum allowed level to 1. and trade it manual, in this way you don´t have to watch 28 pairs - if a scout is opened - watch the pair, look at the last data, and step in or leave it.

Hi Davit, All This is nothing new. I noticed that the present template has Raghee's 34emas for H,L,C calculated 12 times, the standard deviation twice and and 20 SMA twice for every tick on each pair when each should be calculated once per tick. That's a lot of wasted cpu cycles. Attached is the indi name DWave v1 which does the same, without the CPU overhead of redundant calculations, with some additional capabilities. The first one shows the band as the original. The Second one shows Extreme Points of two and three STDevs --&gt; ShowBands=False. Hope it helps. Cheers Pat DWave file goes to MQL indicator folder. Save and Restart MT4. Save the Template on the desktop. Go to Mt4. Click on Templates &gt;Load and look for #Dwave on the desktop. Once done save template in MT4. The News, ADR and Mag Price indis should be in your Indi folder. Let me know if there are issues. Did this over the weekend with markets closed so check for accuracy.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I will start adding back into my long from where the gap will close IF we get there

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi Pat, grabbed it and compared it to Raghee's, looks the same to me other than a yellow added to the black (for want of a better name) sliders on the candles. If it's less of a resource hog then I'm all for it thanks I added a regression channel to Raghee's/Davit's version which gives me a better idea of trend. You will see I have a trade running demo on this pair I took on the basis of that indicator. It is telling me this pair's on the way down. I'm picking as the channel is indicating trend down the candles will fall to the bottom of the channel. It will be a massive trade for me if my theory works. I-Regr is mentioned in page 13/14 of this thread, there-a-bouts anyway. I saw it, grabbed it and understood it right away I've taken the BBs off Raghees as I've never been able to understand them properly, to me the I-Regr is much easier. Probably doing the same with D-wave sorry Pat, now where's that man running away emoticon EDIT, I see you included a bands of feature, Thanks Pat. But that leaves artifacts or are they boxes on the charts? I'll post one now to show what I mean By the way Raghee has started her own thread in commercial if anyone hasn't seen her around yet. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=492080 Trust no one minds the link to her thread, she has posted a few video's there. Don't want to tread on anyones toes after all it was this thread of Davit's that taught me about this method of trading

--- 帖子 #596 ---
closed all EG shorts at 7992 +45pips EU went back to previous strong support at 3360 and very likely bounce again so getting out.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi Pat Thanks for your inputs.As far as this being new I already stated on my 1st page source where ideas came from so be default I didn't claim it was new furthermore hardly anything is new in trading.Everything is pretty much recycling old ideas.Difference is seeing the nuances of live market and practicing sound trading principles. Having said this I have not seen 2BB combination with WAVE before . Horner is using CCI and trades on lower time frame.I am using RSI with WR% and higher TF with 2 BB. Even Horner's wave is nothing new Vegas system is using same idea therefore even her idea is not new.... I believe unique combination of my set up is new. Regards

--- 帖子 #598 ---
UJ Short @ 102.58 TP 102.30 SL 103.08 waiting for EU to bounce again and hopefully EG does too so I can sell it again. EC and GU running from friday with BE placed.

First Long on EU Showing 1hr tf but is based on daily information

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Its wrong entry friend Daily is clearly pointing down RSI WR% hooking down from 50 level Guys this concept is critical 50 level rejection of RSI is significant While you might get lucky trade going your way but that installs wrong way to see PA and next time you can find yourself in deep hole. Just remember guys longing GU from 69 and kept longing and PA kept falling...

Sure I am trading what works for me and you should the same.I see tremendous value of BB and drawing straight lines box like avoids huge aspect of BB bands function This happens on every thread system generating hundreds of green pips and 50pages later it does not even resemble what it started with. I have been trading like this for 8 months with 80% equity gain and there is no reason to change even if my cpu is working hard .

--- 帖子 #612 ---
No need to be sorry.You might have correct trade since EU is at previous strong support however I try to eliminate as much as possible wrong entries,human errors over long haul. Success in trading is repeating same adds over series of trades and in this context I must approach every pair with same way. Regards

I have been kind of paying attention to volume privately of late so lets have fun with this EU Looking at 5min chart (volume Low TF is most important) Biggest volume extreme are Red impulse dump.Then we get volume dry up on Bull side and now drops off all together.What is this telling there is no interest in buying Euro now.

Hi Davit, What I meant by nothing new here is not your system which is very effective but what I was about to post. I meant the indi in its original form is identical to your template(ShowBands=true). It just uses considerably less CPU cycles as I explained in the original post. The yellow is just my choice of the down candle bar color . Go to properties and change the down candle color to Black to remove the yellow. If Show Bands=false it removes the bands and replaces them with extreme levels. What do those "boxes" show?. They are extreme points on the charts defined by your system, that is the rsi is &lt;30 or Greater than 70, and Wpr is &lt;-80 or greater than -20 and the high or the low has crossed the upper BB or the lower BB respectively. The two sets of lines at the top represent the PA crossing of the BBs (solid line Dev=3 &amp; Dotted Dev=2) while RSI and WPR are in extreme overbought zones. These are the high probability resistance levels as defined by your analysis. There is good probability the trend will reverse for a few days which the hooking of the RSI and WPR indicate to you. Vice versa for supports. You will also notice that the extreme levels match previously established levels giving you a high probability of reversal. BB levels tell you that the price, assuming gaussian in nature( Bell Curve) ,will stay 67% of the time between dev= 2 bands and 99% within the dev= 3 bands. So they too indicate a type of extreme level. When a level shows up in the area of the PA , it's an alert that extreme level conditions have been met. If Solid Dev3 and Dev 2. If dotted Dev 2 only. Those who use CCI use the crossing of the + - 100 levels similar to rsi crossing 70 30 from above and below. CCi is just an EMA in a horizontal form. Similarly the 34 EMA that raghee uses, the crossing of the mid line usually coincides with RSI 14 crossing the 50 line. When you mention that the the Rsi is bouncing from the 50 level, the pa would be doing the same with the Raghee Ribbon. Hope this answers some questions raised here and proves beneficial in your trading. Cheers Pat

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Thanks Pat for explanation I am assuming you codded the indicator yourself if yes great job.I am very impressed. Your understanding what I am doing is great as well.Stick around friend and fire away.I am biased towards RSI.Played with CCI and I was never happy with it. REgards Just changed my template with your indicator with BB on

Anyone else been interested in NZDJPY short? Daily chart below, it looks as though it *should respect the Williams 50 zone. One position in and another waiting for a little more confirmation. Screen clip below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Davit, when you add positions do you just do it with your own discretion and price starts to go your way? or do you have a method to do it that you stick to? I really like the adding to wining positions philosophy just been trying to work out an effective way of doing it without increasing ones risk significantly...

Going well so far... Second position in the market and risk reduced on both for an acceptable risk level across the 2 positions.

Good Day all, I'am start short NU @0.8445 CMIIW...

--- 帖子 #625 ---
After having another look at it yesterday I flattened out the EU long for 7 pips and closed the GU long this morning for 47 pips Still holding the GBPNZD long for now - up about 130pip - not a text book trend continuation as the retrace is/was a bit deep. Lets see what the news brings today GL Rooi

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Guys look where EU is now. System has solid perimeters for preventing unnecessary losses.I have shown a lot here and discussed a lot here but rest is up to you. If you are looking for quick profit to millions system then there is none.Every profitable system requires understanding of price action and understanding risk management. If you lack discipline,trigger happy,inpatient then trading is probably not for you. This requires mental training. Regards

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I will no longer place live signals here.Only closed trades. Finding trades is not difficult based on my BB system. You are required to take your own initiative in this regard.. Thank you

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Best thing that could ever happen. People need to make their own calls.Its the only way you learn really. Good luck and look forward to seeing your trades in the future All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Good thing too Davit, I would like to see your charts after the trades are done if that is possible - with the trade being marked for learning purposes - I mean just by dragging the trade to the chart so it draws the line from open to close... Personally if you post live signals and I am not already looking at getting in I don't take the trade - as your opinion has influenced mine by that time and I don't wish to trade someone else's opinion for a minute... Loving the system btw, I have been evaluating a few methods in the last little while as I have been struggling to settle on a style, but this is my focus now, no more 5 minute charts! If it all goes to plan I will be posting positive results as well soon enough Cheers mate

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Thanks Pat, as you know I wondered about those "boxes", will go study on them now Have been back to the original posts (yours and mine) as well and saw your second chart with those boxes, oops made me feel duh as I hadn't looked properly at it. But still the explanation was needed by me, thanks again

--- 帖子 #632 ---
High Guys Good potential trades short side on UJ U/CHF AN Long side NU AU

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hey Davit, I am already in NU, the others you mention need a little more developing for me but definitely on the radar. Closed my short NJ for a total of +50. It may go further but my Bias on NU turning long also makes me think NJ could have done its dash and either reverse long or stall out as well. Think I will be leaving these others for Today's bars to close before making any more decisions...

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Nice that you know when to pull the trigger.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hello Davit, I do not understand why AU is long candidate? For other pairs you mentioned it is clear to me, but for AU not. Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hi L Its a continuation trade.Chart should clear it up. Daily. H4 Overall trend up.That is going with the trend buying dips.Concept of buying dips or selling rallies is what big institutions do.Just because AU dropped 100pips does not negate overall trend.This pair is ideal for position building and holding.With positive swap you got nothing to lose provided you don't over-leverage or over-trade

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Thanks for the system Davit. Long on GCh. 4day range but "conflict" between absolute LL and dev3 HL. RSI up from below 30. Kan Edit: am aware of news in 45mins.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
GCH is flip side of EG Just something to keep in mind Swiss franc is -99 correlation with Euro.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Got 23 live trades Tomorrow Feds meeting should be interesting.I anticipate dovish cautiousness. In my way of thinking what looks unreal is opertunity.Just read my signature. I suggest reduce your lots and average in your price. For example if you are not sure UJ will go higher then take your intended amount divide in 4 and sell on every 15pips up hence your avarage price is far better then entering all at once. This is what I do and know lot of other traders do likewise.Always keep back up ammo.Troops in reserve for that X factor To me trading is war and you are commander in chief of your army.Tactics in battles are very similar to trading.Big money loves overrun retail positions clear stops then once cleared going opposite direction.Only way for me to survive is reducing my lots and become agile and flexible. Know also when you lost the battle and get out so you can have another chance to battle. Finally floodgates are breaking on AN

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Good Morning Davit I agree. GU?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Funny Chris I saw GU and thought about you for real Serendipity

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi Davit, one question regarding continuation, if you don't mind. Do you trigger a continuation trade when the upper tf's show a trend and in H4 you hit a certain BB-deviation plus some other indicator value? Looked thru the thread, but didn't really find the rules, maybe overlooked it. Thanks. LD

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I think we'll see some changes today. Currently long GU, short AN &amp; UJ and in need of coffee ... badly! lol

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi Larry I meant continuation meaning move that started from last swing 3rd deviation.My system has 2 parts.CT and Trend trading.AU is in Trend trading category in my view.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
got nothing to drink and feeling weird.Not alcoholic but love drinking and trading Richard Donchian (father of trend trading) was drunk just about every night and according to friends he traded better that way.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
News must of put you on money

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Ok, but this second long was triggered by a signal in H4? Thanks for explaining.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
RSI WR% were pointing up on H4 and daily at the time of the trade and still is valid trade. To me only valid way to trade AU and NU is to buy at these levels unless you want to pay swap.When opportunity presents I buy and this is more general trading not specific to systems. Buy low sell high. Larry I also build positions.I can have as many as 12 trades in 1 pair.That's what I do and don't necessarily recommend others. I can easily buy AU all the way to 90 and not even flinch. Search HDA at FF and read about his posts.The guy is master position trader.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Okay, thanks again. Agree about the swap, am trying to avoid shorting the aussi as well. Atm trying to place another long, but for me no signal yet.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Like I said eariler I avarege in my orders.To me 93 9250 92 is "Buy ZONE" since I don't know excatly when price will rebound up I prefer to have a position. I trade long term position building and short term swing trading.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Davit, UJ, ENZD looking good for sell..later i'll post the chart

Unfortunately not. Twitchy re news so went to b/e prior. Price dropped to my b/e exactly before shooting up. That's just the way it goes sometimes. Kan

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Davit, what do you think about EU long? Daily PA is between Dev2 and Dev3, Williams is hooking up. Today is FOMC meeting, it is possible, they will try to soften dollar, because of currency war. Is anybody considering long EU before FOMC?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
I am already long through shorting U/CHF which is same as long EU Difference is U/CHF travels less.I prefer that. regards

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Closed AU long from 9293 at 9310 2x +30pips I think We will see lower numbers again around news time to get in at better prices. I have limit long at 9250 2xfor that spike right before announcements.This is good trick.Let your limit get triggered at best price and be in profit in minutes. Often time during news either you get re-quote or horrible spread so limit orders are best for news.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi Davit, very good point about limits. I have also looked at the Aussie ... 0.9270 or a bit lower like 0.9250 looks valid for long.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
that sound good 9270 as well Will join you green pips friend

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Don't know yet if I will take these ... need margin, not happy with my draw down on GBP/USD long ... bought way too early. Issues I have to address after 3 months of good trading stability.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I pointed often based on my system here longing GU dangers. It happens.I have DD on UJ and AN now. We will see how things unfold after Feds BS Current massive bull on USD is driven by Japanese and Chinese and looking at UJ is obvious.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Cannot read it all, and thought by myself it would be a good idea. Well, obviously it was stupid. USD is ridiculously strong heading into FOMC. Fundamentally makes no sense to me, but if you search for sense in these movements, just do not look further than greed.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
As far as I know, slip for limit and stop orders is not applicable. So, broker can execute limit and stop orders with any slip he likes. I think that limit and stop orders during news time are not good idea. Correct me if i wrong

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I think you did the right thing , Im sure there were people too lazy to learn that would come here and copy your trades.

Is anybody short UJ from yesterday?

beware e/u has room for downside... maybe from there we can land a longterm long position.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
1st Part Trend following This part is based on Raghee Horner's 34 EMA (she has ton of videos on youtube for further knowledge) Simply brilliant concept.Why 34? Well it works best in my view and Raghee's and its a Fib number. Trades are taken when PA is above Wave green color candles and below wave red candles,blue candles are neutral best not trade. 1hr 4hr and daily must be in sink Davit, what do you mean with "1hr 4hr and daily must be in sink"? Maybe RSI must hooking up/down? PA must be above/below 34EMA? Or something else?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
This EA is overtrading. 1400 trades in few days

--- 帖子 #674 ---
i´m not at home so i cannot check what´s the issue, but as far as i know now it´s a problem with the exittrigger. Position is opended and closed immediately =&gt; spread. will report on saturday!

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Long on E Cad. A continuation trade based on price coming off bottom of range / triple bottom. This is similar to the continuation trade that Davit called yesterday on AU. Both were confirmed to me by a channel strategy that I'm testing. Kan

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi Lapras This is basic online for trend following. Moves start at lower TF but I prefer 1h lowest . If Hourly is going down and H4 going down but daily slightly going up then that should give you a pause because your lower TF are out of sink When they are in sink this is what you see H1 PA above Wave green candles H4 PA above Wave green color Daily up but approaching sell zone so further up gains are limited. Notice RSI remaining 50 or above on H1 H4 Daily confirms trend is strong.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Example trade that I am in 4 positions I'll wait until 50level is reached then either exit or continue down having said this its obvious overall big trend is up hence 890-880 is realistic target and that's decent 80pip distance with 4 positions 320pips

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Even though I said I won't place live trades I'll show you one I just did on EJ Should price go higher I will add more trades (that's what I do build a position but not necessary) My minimum criteria shorting EJ is reached.RSI hit 70 but WR% is way above it.Price is very close to get inside BB zone From technical perspective this is major resistance.Double top and major structures on left

Davit- How's your wave system looking for UJ?

Hi G It could do all that you said it might but I trade swings and nothing goes in straight line. If I am wrong I'll get out.If I am right 80% of time that's decent. REgards

I am in rather in large positions and there are lot of harmonic confluences here on H4 and Daily If it was going to go higher today's' positive data should of provided impetus but I suspect MM are looking lower numbers to get in again. 102.70-80 retrace I am looking

I agree- thanks

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Good afternoon Davit. Hope all is well brother. I'll be joining you on EJ tomorrow or perhaps Monday. Have you looked at AN? GN is paying me well again. I think that's my new favorite pair. Just waiting for the dollar shoe to drop on my UJ shorts and GU longs.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Funny part whenever price reaches high level all of sudden out of blue we get guys calling numbers out of their rabbit hats GU at 1.72 they were calling 1.74-1.80 even EU at 1.39 were calling 1.42 Same shit now 106 110 etc EJ 1.42!!! (never mind EZ fundamentals are about to get worse) I wonder what happened to guys calling on GU and EU longs then.... Worst part when they had trend lines pointing to moon and under impression just because it was pointing 1.76 GU it was gonna go there.. This kind of thinking always baffles me.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi Chris AN is still underwater.I made the mistake shorting early.Plain erroneous mistake on my part. This is the part I just have to wait and give trades time as CNtrader says often "I waited patiently to bank" REgards

Yeah, and what did our illustrious leader do? Came out to make a very short comment and went right back to playing golf moments later. I could NOT be more ashamed of my fellow countrymen for voting this useless piece of crap into office! TWICE!!!!

To add more he deported more illegal immigrates then all conservative presidents before much dismay of liberal left. Or while Israel was bombing Gaza killing civilians in hundreds including kids our president allowed another aid bill pass without any conditions attached to Israel while they were actively bombing Gaza indiscriminately. Bush senior at least had conditions attached to 3 billion we pay every year to oppressive colonial state called Israel. Latest fiasco was Ben Netanyahu told ambassador to US "You will do what you are told" This is what we have come down to.Hostage "democracy" to special interest groups who hijacked our government and hold them by the balls while our cities are crumbling,schools are getting closed our government pays 3 billion check no questions ask every year. Its a shame really

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Ummm... I hope you're kidding about that, right? Have you heard of the 1000's crossing the border every week for months because he and his "liberal left" are advertising a free ride in central and south America for them? Or how they're shipping hundreds to states all over the country in secret without even letting the state officials know ahead of time before they get there? Or having them screened for criminal backgrounds or sicknesses before doing so? How our "border guards" are so busy with them walking up and surrendering themselves that they can't actually "guard" the border for the "bad ones"? How Texas FINNALY had to call in the national guard (at their expense) to fill in that gap? How they just let 1000's of convicted VIOLENT illegals out of jail to walk free? Some of which have been deported AND arrested many times before? He "may" have deported a bunch but they come right back. And now he's more than made up for it 10 fold by extending an open invitation to all. Our so called "government" has only TWO constitutionally stated objectives. Protect our people and our borders. I see neither being done. By either side. End of rant. My apologies.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Issue is deeper.When a special interest group buys both democrats and Republicans and shapes foreign policy to their needs then there is serious issue of what constitute sovereign nation . As it stands now US does not have free independent foreign policy.We are a vessel state.

Short EN - DT off the BB. RSI/WPR pointing down. Looking for mid 34 or dev2 BB target

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi Jeff Your short does not fit in my system.PA is above WAVE not even close to BB zone. RSI and WR%is at 50 but could turn and go up and become strong continuation trade. Remember PA respecting 50RSI confirms the trend It could end up becoming a winning trade but the entry is incorrect

--- 帖子 #702 ---
currently up +170pips on UC in 4 positions from 75 Big data tomorrow on Cad and I may exit before that just in case of negative.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Nice, hows your overall week been pip wise? just out of interest, I haven't had a lot of trades - trying to be picky... Up for the week so not complaining though... My NU long is looking like maybe having some legs after an initial DD. I'll be looking to TP when RSI is around the 50 or the MA wave comes into play, its counter trend so don't want to expect too much.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I have good chunk of DD now on EJ,UJ and AN These trades overshot due to Feds.I will have to give it time.I have been in situations like this many times so I am calm.Patience is the key. Next week we might get corrections started. In retrospect I should of given the Feds meeting lot more importance.Lesson learned.

good trading .SL to BE Keep in mind Yellen talking today at 10am.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Holding 4 CAD shorts from 75 to 880 TP Very green retail numbers Yellen could come out and play Dovish for fear of upsetting markets Those 401K's depend on cheap dollar

--- 帖子 #710 ---
lol how funny it would be if Yellen came out and raised rates, then walked off the stage flipping the bird.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
she can't do it now.Labor market is very soft.Those "jobs" that are created are mostly service industry that generally don't pay much. It used to be 9months unemployment collected to 12 months with extension then they reduced to 6 months and some states even 3 months Guess what those people are going to do after their checks stops.Get a minimum job flipping burgers or any other low paying jobs. I have not bought our "recovery" story yet. Growth projection by IMF for 2014 is 1.7% and now hovering around 2%.2% growth is no growth.Its a rescission number regards

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Absolutely, I've held these views as well, and the 4% GDP number sealed it for me- as far as I'm concerned they are simply lying to keep the currency afloat. But man- if only Yellen was a true gangster, I would die of laughter.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
4GDP number is a joke.There is some creative math going on here.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
yesterday you mocked people who where selling jpy. it was clear in the charts that it is heading to 104. It can go to 105 easily and possibly 107. good luck with your positions

I am also short UJ. why do you think it may go to 107? Maybe double top is forming on DF, please check pic

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Still holding shorts- Still not worried. Yellen told us all we need to know. Until we hit 2% inflation- nothing changes. They can take the dollar to the moon if they want, its just gonna fall harder.

Hi G 1st you come to my thread placing lot of opinions without trading this system.Just wondering why you even bother considering they are lots of system threads. 2nd I did not mock people selling Yen I voiced my opinion that people projecting deep in the future are baffling to me and gave examples.

Error I made not looking ahead on news.Feds day was huge even though Yellen was Dovish 90% of her presentation..but dropped that If this and that then we will raise interest rate earlier.Basically saying we'll see how things unfold in coming months.

AU Showing resilience and like to get on on BUll side 9250 or lower NU same 50 lower would be ideal 8350

Hello Davit and testers, there is some progress with the EA (thanks PontusLSE) , the loop in entry opens and exits was caused through the close routine of the EA, so it didn´t happen in backtests, only when there is a opposite entry to the same time: Attached Image (click to enlarge) so i´m glad that i have fixed the startlot of the testversion to 0.01lot when looking how fast this bug could empty an 50K account. hope nobody had the same problem life!! I wrote a PN to twee to clean up the post with the file... Attached Image when tested forward the new version for a few days it will be uploaded here again. Should be sometime in the beginning of september... regards thodie

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Thodie thanks for your efforts. Yes please don't trade this EA live yet until everything works properly and shows good results on demo. I wished I could be helpful but I am not a coder Thks bro

--- 帖子 #727 ---
U/CHF Looking primed for shorting.Because of -99 correlation with Euro one to watch is Euro however Swissy got beat up less then Euro suggesting resiliency.

AUD/JPY This has gone to Stratosphere A level trade potential over 100pips Once again watch market behavior

--- 帖子 #729 ---
CAD/CHF a pair I never traded before starting to look good to short Some room up on RSI but H4 clearly got rejected once PA went into my BB zone H4 showing sign of exhaustion Note long tails sign of bull rejection If you want more info Its a classic fractal H4

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hello Davit, i´m also not a pro in coding, still learning and need partially the help of other coders i started without programming background in dec 13 / jan 14, glad there are some other coder in the other house. You could help indeed to improve it a bit, not the initial position this logic is well done, more in adding and stacking up positions. as you wrote you have many positions in U/J last week what is your entry criteria (what should the EA look for) i guess you you switch to the lower TF after the initial order and add each time the Support or Resistance zone is met or the RSI / WP hook in the prefered direction? regards thodie

--- 帖子 #731 ---
THodie I trade based on budget on each pair Lets say example I wanted to short UJ at 103 and set aside $400 I divide 400 in 2 equaling 1/2 lot each pip thus allowing me 800pips distance Now as long as I think trade is valid I will add to trade even if previous trades are red.This is because my SL is $400 or 800pips This way it allows multiple orders and trade without Hard Stop I don't know how this can be coded but that's what I do.This is not martingale since I do have SL but this method allows freedom to stack on opertunity for max gain like I have done on UC 4 orders but could increase it to 8. I usually hold back my orders until trades show promise then hammer it even harder.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Davit: Do you start small and place larger entries when the market goes against you with pre-determined plans or keep all entries the same lot size? (Pyramiding I guess is what this is referred to as?)

--- 帖子 #733 ---
I keep lots same but when I see obvious exhaustion I will add more at that level.This concept took me a while to refine. Idea is simple.Your system says all criteria met and you should go long or short. Fine I get in and market decides to go against me another 30pips and still all criteria the same.I will add another short Once market goes my way I will add more shorts down as well and move SL to BE or protect profits thus further orders are free from burden of over trading. Its also important that you have the freedom to exit the trade entirely if behavior of the market does not look good anymore thus saving your substantial loss. Please read "Bird Watching in Lion Country" many ideas were taken from this book.Google there is free PDF Have you noticed that usually once you exit your losing trade then trade goes your way without you?This phenomena has lot to do with key level getting busted by purpose and mass exodus takes place and once that happens usually big boys unload their trades. This is why I don't exit trades at Round numbers or 20-30's because of lot of false moves Example look at UJ price broke 104 spiked 20pips killed lot of shorts mass exodus then abruptly declined.Notice my short lower still there unfazed.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
totally agree - and my mention of that wasn't shouldn't be construed as contesting what you're talking about at all - I employ similar strategy along with intensive price action analysis. Because of how deep the analysis goes I don't trade many pairs, but, in turn, I am able to take advantage of a lot of opportunity on the few pairs I do trade. My setup revolves around reversal targets and the calculation of them and it is not uncommon at all for price to get close to a reversal target, back up, then finally hit it. Happens VERY often. The reason I mention that strategy is to lower your average entry on your trades bringing your break even point closer to your lowest or highest entry as applicable to the direction you're trading. I use a similar "budget principle" as you in that I have a set maximum total lot size I will trade on my account based on my understanding of the range of the pairs I'm trading. I use max margin use % and also keep a keen eye on how many pips it is to a margin call. Because of my reversal target calcs, I have a clear picture of extreme highs and lows and consider those stop losses, but frankly, those levels are rarely reached, so, worrying with stop losses becomes a moot point.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
hi davit, first thank you for this thread, i trade mostly on H4, recently discovered your thread...i agree with you on a correction and for me its 1.34 area, please see chart (ignore entry and sl, its do to my own system)the question is, in case of pointing down again rsi and wpr from 50 level, what would you do, take profit or si at be and wait or what else, thaks....

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hi Sam Welcome ! At 50 level you can either take TP or should price go your way then go all the way to other side of BB RSI WR% zone. My personal opinion is fundamentally Euro zone is in shambles therefore sellers will pound Euro on rallies hence very likely scenario is sharp decline from 34 although I am doubtful it will even go that high. Regards

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have been waiting for this one to fall for about a week, and its kept going up for 100+ pips unbelievable

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hi Santos.Yes Yen got killed all week.That was the case with UJ and EJ as well. Based on my system it would of not been correct to short 100pips below current price.Price should be in BB zone RSi 70 WR%20 It is very ripe to fall now See my post 728

Error I made underestimating end of the month,summer and Yellen talking. Yen got hammered and caught lot of traders off guard. I am a huge fan of following important news and dropped the ball on this one.Seating good amount of DD on Yen now.Not happy with my trading in this respect. The reason this is important this DD influenced my correct decision to go long on AU at 9250 9270 however due to exposure I exited early.Regretted that decision.Its amazing how account pressure can shape your decisions.Certainly lot of lessons there to learn. If anyone placed limit orders at 9250 AU long when I did good for you.We could see 94 in coming weeks

===================== Hi Davit Thank you for your prompt reply -- I hv no problem in saving the indic or tpl as i am very qualified in MT4-- The last tpl u sent me was already used by one of the three charts i posted in my previous post -- My question remains Do I hv to add manually the other indicators (shown in post #1) ? and do I hv to consider their default settings (This is a critical point) ? -------------------------- Herewith attached a chart done by the last tpl (#dwave) u sent me showing the missing of many indicators -- Why not issuing a tpl that covers all the indicators that allows us to go directly to synchronize our follow up with your work -------------------------------------- Thanks

Nope, no one can say that. That said, your system is so solid, that if you see a drop off in posts, that means people are busy trying to do what you do. Your charts are clear, they are even color coded. Your explanations are superb. This is an excellent way to generate signals. All that remains is whether or not you choose to share how you manage your fund. That is sensitive information, so do not share it without consideration.

It's not over either in my humble opinion brother. I just entered short this morning. Looking for another 80/120 possible. Let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi Jmn Thanks for vote of confidence. I approach trading like business and measure my success in quarters.This eliminates feeling crappy about indidividual trades.Bigger picture helps. This is from my trading plan STOP LOSS 1 Decide how much each swing is worth example $500 2. Divide $500 into mini lots for multiple entries example .50c a pip gives 1000 pip distance 3. This allows averaging in orders as seen fit irregardless if previous orders are in red 4. Orders are placed as long as reason for trade is still valid 5. If conditions change loss is taken since orders are not all placed all at once this allows smaller loss Swings Each Swing investment $500 Swing is taken as loss once -$500 is reached There are no exceptions.No running red beyond $500 Orders broken down into mini lots that satisfies each swing consist of 10-15 trades

Hi Chris Need UJ correction which I think will happen 103.20-30 area 1st step. Very dismal housing sells show people are either running out of money or don't have confidence in "recovery" of US economy.We both agree that much of Yellen's rhetoric was hogwash.I think we will see study USD decline in coming months.

New harmonic on the weekly printed today. I posted it up in the UJ thread

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Agreed buddy. On UJ I have 103.069 overall with a bump or two on the way. 135.712 on EJ with a bump at 136.345. We'll see. I think we may see an uptick in pending and/or existing home sales next month. In this vibrant "recovery" we have going here , existing property is a great investment right now. Take it from a guy who's forced to sell at about 100k less than fair market value in a "real" economy. I think you, Mr. Scott, I and I'm sure many others caught the overall dovish speech by Granny with the bone for the hawks at the very end. lol

Market maker psychology, I reckon these moves are the reason the majority dont succeed at trading and never understand why. Sorry about the template Davit, heres an example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 200 EMA, 100 main trends both up and price manipulated to touch quarter levels and shot back up good for 60+ pips, and you can see afterwards it drops from higher quarter levels back lower into trend again, I think everyday this happens.

Davit.. Just got done reading the thread and I'm very impressed with what you've done so far. I have been in the process of moving my trading to the higher time frames and your system looks very promising. I'm already familiar with the 34 EMA wave but haven't really used the BBs or your RSI indicator. Have loaded your template and will start to study your entries and hopefully take some trades with the system in the next few weeks. Cheers....

Hi Davit, I have been watching your thread since few months ago and I really admire your trading systems. I finally make this account so that I can post on your thread. Thanks so much for sharing your system and recommending some books to read. I was trying a lot of systems (and of course lost a significant amount of money) with different time frames but none fits me yet since I have 9-5 job everyday which not allows me to look at my chart regularly. Now I only look at my chart once after the daily candle close and so far I am happy with it. I wish I read the disciplined trader book before I trade, but I will keep going and never look back. I never thought phycology is very crucial in this business. Now that I can read that book with smile because I learnt it hard way. Thanks for sharing and I am looking forward to have some discussion with you in the future.

Welcome Timmy Glad you find this system worth looking into.I already demonstrated live trades placed and closed in profit and that should already confirm its not a fluke.

You are the 1st person here referencing "disciplined trader" Kudos to you.Yes I am still dealing with psychology myself.I closed 300pip trade that within 6hrs could of been 500pips trade...Its a constant refining process.

I'm still long Euro due to my own system, but my return on EU historically is horrible. I only allow EU very minimal of my account. I am still short UJ though, bears have entered the market, putting up a good fight.

EJ short 2x 3719 2x3723 This is short trade based on daily ADR Daily is reached 55 pips up from lows 52pips last 5days. Its done basically for today

Hi Dave. I´ve been in and out, long only, UC for months now. Last bought at 1.0650 and sold at 1.0900. I´m looking to go long again somewhere between 1.0700 and 1.0750. How do you see it? I like your system. Good work !!!

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I used to cut profit and keep the losing trade because it is so damn difficult to keep profitable trade running.. now I use ADR or SR level as my SL/TP points. BTW what do you think about NZD USD? I love the swap from this pair and it agree with your CT rules Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Welcome Alorente I like your work as well specially on fibs If 1080 holds I anticipate another attempt at 950 zone then I plan to sell aggressively again but this time let it fall lot further. I think we will see 950 zone again most likely. Typical head and shoulder formation and right shoulder is incomplete Back of my mind I am always looking at Elliot Wave patterns.Rations to me not as important as general fractal nature of EW http://www.mypivots.com/site/userfil...cf1ad23647.png

EJ breaking down nicely

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi Davit, to take a trade on your system, do you wait for a candle close or do you take a trade whenever the criteria is met? GU looks bloody nice for a long but daily candle is not closed yet I already started with small lots anyway

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I also mention that trade specially CT trade should support some fundamentals. As long as Euro is in free fall GU will follow suit since its highly correlated.GU was buy zone in my system for hundreds of pips and I strongly advised not to buy and its proven to be correct saving lot of potential losses. I am not buying GU but actively selling Euro Your longs by the way has lot of harmonic support so don't get scared 50-70pip north likely but stay vigilant

--- 帖子 #796 ---
AU looks getting top exhausted NU looks stronger

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I am also Euro bearish, although I did the short EJ earlier than you at 137.00 which makes me still on RED ;p How do you know about the harmonic support? I only have ZUP indi for harmonic pattern but it is sometimes a bit confusing for me. I am a bit worried because it looks like still heading south but today bulls are very strong.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Place zig zag See the shape.Draw the pattern look at harmonic patterns see if any match. Its a bullish shark to me. If you are worried then you are either over trading or your position lot is disproportionate to your account. Trading should be almost stress free.When you are worried and stressing then something is wrong with your position size.Reduce lots and allow room for trade to "breathe" If wrong exit take the loss and try again.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hi Davit after a couple of years loosing money im keeping with somes green pips with your system, also im doing a file with all post and explanations to make a kind of book about your system with questions of peopple and your answers, if you dont care in any moment i could share it. also are you short on AN? i see a kinf of SHS at 4H Attached Image (click to enlarge) and waiting for short at AJ until next week?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Thanks Now I can leave my trade for a good night sleep. Btw do you also share your harmonic indi?it looks very clean and tidy. I am half color blind so I really like less color and clean chart I once tried ADX and MTS system and I am completely lost because of the colors

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Hi facu Please continue compiling any useful posts by me or others.I am by no means expert and don't pretend to be one.Just sharing what works for me. I am heavy short on AN I am looking 100+pips south on this. Glad you are making some pips

Well, I'm no good at drawing things. You're the true artist.

Chris don't sell yourself short you are a true artist things you have created.I saw those wood beams you created.Very beautiful.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Oh I wasn't buddy. If it's wood, it's good. I should show you some other works sometime. Although those beams did come out rather nice. No I meant on the charts with Harmonics. It's very strange. I can "see" them almost instantly on the charts but can't seem to draw them correctly at all. ... lol

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Sounds great. I'll take a look at the zig zag tool.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
It is not the lot size, but I think I am still have that trauma like mentioned by Mark Douglas I usually open 1.4Eur/pip with 10000 Euro account. Now I have 2 open positions, I am still trying to be more relaxed. What do you think about AUDCHF? 82% correlated with AUDNZD but this one looks about to go south based on your CT system. It also has a nice rejection.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
ah I just realized there will be red news on AUD soon...

EJ on daily but still trying to find shape that fits the pattern. From the move coming from top I can already tell its a bullish pattern but generally D leg can go deep even if its bullish pattern. Manually drawn by using zig zag

--- 帖子 #811 ---
By the ratio I see the D leg at 135.976. My exit will likely will be between that and 136.345. If it gets there of course.

Just waiting for now.... Took CAD/JPY short at 9566 2x If you look at left you can tell this zone got rejected before.Basically a double top

on Aussie 1st challenge 9364 2nd 9386 3rd 9421 (ideal place to short) On my system you can tell RSI is not in 70 hence no shorting.This works with harmonic since ideal area for short is higher.

Took early short on 15min ss &amp; rsi-%r hooking down. 4h was in the ct zone and rsi-%r is now turning down. Daily is also @ r/s zone &amp; rsi-%r approaching 50. Could see pa move back to .83 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Charts make guessing the data "almost" too easy. I'm with you on CAD/YEN too Davit. In small at 95.549. Not convinced it won't stretch to test the top again so starting out small. Anyway, I'm being lazy again. I must get to work here. Enjoy the day folks.

hi davit,i think its grab candles from ibfx...look at this

--- 帖子 #829 ---
I'm a little confused on this trade. The price action is above the 34 EMAs and you took a short. Also when did you place your order, was it at the close of yesterdays daily bar 27 Aug 2014 or was it sometime before on one of the days where the %R indy dips downward. ? I was under the impression that the daily bars had to be closed before we initiated a position or have I missed something?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Thanks will check it out.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hi OzzieDave I never said daily bar needs to be closed.Trade fits every criteria of counter trade.Its on my 1st page.This system has 2 components CT and Trend following. I focus on swings.

Hi Davit, Been following your posts and thread. Very informative so far. What is your insight on AudNzd? I took a short around the 1.150 area with bearish divergence forming on daily. Aussie data was supportive yesterday and we have moved up higher but haven't made a higher high.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
It is ibfx grab as posted by Sam. When loading them individually to your template I also had to make some changes in the chart properties. Under color, select NONE for candles and bars.

Davit, after testing and trading your system for a few days, I have thought of an indi that would be very helpful with exits. I have noticed that if price jumps a certain distance from the 34 EMA center line, it would be a solid place for an exit before it comes back to the MA again. That distance varies with each pair depending on volatility and market trading conditons. It would be great to have an indi that would tell you in real time, how many pips away from centerline the bid is. You would set the distance in pips for each pair through an extern input. An alert when the pip number is reached would be helpful also. Great system. I have combined it with Extreme TMA instead of BB bands and it is doing very well.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hello Davit, I'm thoroughly enjoying your system. Thanks. Why did you say AUDNZD was a wild goose for you? Anything to do with the difficulties of the NZ economy, the weekend "gap" or the PA? Kan

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Alorente Thanks for enjoying the system. Few observations: You are using RSI 14 not 8 . Average swing is roughly 7-8days and signal system generate on 8 period correspond well with swings. 14 period on daily is 2 weeks of data hence lagging. On BB. I love BB for not only showing volatility but you can see divergences on it as well. If you have not watched this video please do.Very informative 11min mark specially Inserted Video I like your idea of Take profit targets.If you do come out with the indicator please share. Regards

--- 帖子 #840 ---
I simply over-traded on this pair.I usually don't do it but PA has been running wild up without much correction. My entries were earlier and running DD now. We'll see next month could be correction time on this pair if not I will take the loss since weekly up distance is enormous. Regards

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Looks like Japanese Banks are aggressively selling the Yen now Trying to keep the currency weaker and weaker so they can sell their shit at cheaper prices

Quoting wolve Hi Davit, Been following your posts and thread. Very informative so far. What is your insight on AudNzd? I took a short around the 1.150 area with bearish divergence forming on daily. Aussie data was supportive yesterday and we have moved up higher but haven't made a higher high. 'm still bearish on A/N. Price is bucking r/s. Weekly down thru 1h chart price is in or moving down from the ct zone and rsi/%r is in buy zone hooking down. Still short from 1150 with a limit order @ 1200. Looks like next week b4 we see much movement.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Thanks Davit. As you can see from my picture, RSI 14 (Pink) and RSI 8 (Blue) produce practically identical results. I´ve been using 14 all my life. See no reason to change...

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I've had same idea but thought the alert would trigger for ct entry when price spikes exceed the average pips from ma by a given %. Exit would be back @ ma. Would be a great scalping tool. Any coders want to build that ea? Probably already out there somewhere.

Hi Roman I have been bearish on Euro for long time.In fact I closed lot of trades on EJ in profits +200pips this morning Fundamentally Draghi and ECB want lower Euro plus with Ukraine crises (1k Russian soldiers invaded Ukraine territory with armor as I am typing this) Its nothing positive about.Not going to take a chance "finding that bottom" as GU bulls already bitterly tasted since 1.69 My bearish bias will continue unless I see something otherwise either on PA or fundemetal.

Every time You take a trade CT or otherwise you are taking a correlative risk. What this means any trade any time can be "wrong" My system has perimeters about this and I suggest you read the thread. Understanding probability is crucial.What I mean is out of 100 trades I know I can hit 80% winning trades. 75-80 % of forex is in a range.My system is best when pairs go into a range.If you follow my signals as explained clearly then you would know when to enter. You need to do some work friend I can not do the work for you.Your circles are in June ....If you are asking if you CT and PA keeps going higher or lower then you take the loss.I have taken many.Again its just probability but nothing is concrete.This concept is very hard to grasp to new traders but edge is nothing but repeating same signals that generate profits over series of trades not just 1 or 10.I am talking about 500+trades. In larger sample of trades your edge in my case my system edge will generate profits provided you don't let the losers run forever. Taken this concept further Elliot Wave,Harmonics prove that nothing goes in straight line.Read the book I posted on Elliot Wave.This explains why when PA is in BB zone often it corresponds major S/R or EW turning points. REgards

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Top of the morning to you Davit Actually, it's more CAD strength then YEN weakness. Was to be expected as the YEN is ranging and CAD attempting to test yesterday's high.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Good Morning Chris I had many opportunities to bank at 50 but could not do it since I like minimum 50pips... Not given up on it.Once UJ goes into deep correction 103 CJ most likely will hit 94.50'sh I have my TP 94.60

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Should EJ hit 37 I will built shorts on it again. EG is little tricky... Based on my system.I would not short EG.Reason is PA is entering reversal zone.Could work 20-30pips as you like taking them but its cautionary area.. Just notice how beautifully system marked the swing top with RSI BB and WR% Interesting thing is Chris's S/R's often lend on this areas.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Agreed. I was rather hoping for a little higher to add some more. Let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Chris and others Green pips will have to go to sleep. Good night

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Crystal clear! Thanks Davit

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Yes. Either way, pips distance or percentage of price away from centerline would work and indeed, it would be a great aid for scalping... I am no coder, but this sounds like a pretty simple project.

Rest well Davit.

Time to post the updated Version of the BB_WAVE_CounterTrend_EA. do not use this version on a live account until it is further tested on demo to be bug free. If you use it on a life account, you do so on your own risk. There are no warranties or guarantees. Don´t use this EA if you did not understand the strategy behind it! Don´t blame me for losses on a life account, Short manual description: this version will work until 31.12.2014 after this time it won´t not open any other trades. please note the prolonged Tradeduration, sure if you use a trailingstop it´s possible to exit in the next day(s) range = minimum pip distance between 2 orders when the open criteria is fullfilled, be carefull on pairs like the dragon! level = maximum open orders! tp in money = close all orders of the same symbol at a defined profit in money (account currency) you have to attach the EA to on every currency chart you want to trade, use different magic numbers for each symbol, Daily TF is recommended. this EA is for free, but when there is no feedback, bug reports, tips for improvement, don´t expect an improved Version pubilshed here in the coming weeks. sharing ideas/work is always a two way mirror, thats what forums are for! have fun and thank you for testing and sharing ideas. trade safe!

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Hi Davit Sorry I haven't posted this earlier..... Just going back to the CADJPY trade. This is what you said about a counter trend trade: 2nd Part Counter trade daily chart PA inside 2nd 3rd Deviation RSI 70/30 and above WR% above -20 below-80 What confused me is you stated that RSI and WR% were turning down. That is why I asked about the daily close as we all know the daily indicators can show an upturn or downturn but they're not locked in until the day closes. In your rules for a CT trade you state the RSI and WR% just need to be overbought in the case of the CADJPY trade. I take it if the indicator is turning down as the day progresses as with the CADJPY trade this is just used as further confirmation? Would that be a correct assessment of how you use the RSI and WR% on a CT trade?

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Hi Dave Yes your last sentence is correct.Any time RSI WR% pointing down and in BB zone then trade is valid.The reason I don't like waiting daily close because lot of distance PA can move before that occurs and in fact diminishing the edge. This is more obvious on all my EJ trades when price dropped 50 pips down after entry and bounced up within 1day.Had I waited that would not have profitable trade.My system is somewhat advance that it mimics PA in real time instead of waiting 5 MA cross overs and all that BS. I trade aggressively because I recognize that PA moves fast.If for any reason this makes you feel unease I suggest choose system that is more conservative. Regards

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Thanks Davit.. Just trying to understand the details of how you look at trade set ups.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Good morning guys. Spent great deal reading on Yen.Overall sentiment is bullish.BOJ may start easing even more in 2015 forcing Yen 105+ to even 110 If I see no sign of retrace I will take the loss on all Yen trades.

@thodie I'll test your EA, demo, forward, all pairs. The demo acc (broker Global Prime) is linked to MFXB so here you can watch continously (day and night ) the trades + trade results: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGTFX1 (MT4-2000130). Hope that helps and will bring us success.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
good morning Davit, means down on CadJpy? because im short on it.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
@thodie I'll use the bot nearly OOTB. Could explain plz: What is Exittrigger ? trailStop_std - is it to type in pips... right ? 50 pips for the daily I use is ok I think that's reasonable ? Hmm range ? Haven't a clue what's the best ... I leave it untouched - 10 ? Or better 20 for the "wild" pairs ? AND: what about the lot size ? Cant see any possibility for choosing a lot size or risk number ?

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hello and nice sunday, EMA exit means, the EA will close all open positions on the next meeting with the EMA34 on Daily TF Exittrigger is an exit in case of a countersignal so if you have som buy positions, they will be closed in case of a sell signal that works good in range but can be worse in a strong trend. The Trailingstop can work in both variants to activate enter the amount of pips you want to trail, if you want to deactivate the trailingstop just enter a zero. Range depends not only on pair, also on the account size and risk aversion, GBP/USD for example had the first buy signal aroungd 1.69 - so the ea would have been buying everytime the condition would be met. That´s many pips and it can happen, so don´t forget about the fundamentals. Lotsize is restricted to 0.01Lot as i don´t want people to loose serious money on their life accounts. Not everybody listen when i say test on DEMO. A minor bug in the first version caused a rapidfire of more than 4000trades with 0.50 start lot and crashed an 50K demoaccount within hours only by the spread . Don´t take it personal, see it as a protection from ourself , the forward tests on demo will show what this EA is able to do and what not. As this EA aims for xxx pips marginal differences in the spread won´t have much impact. regards thodie and thanks for testing!

Incorrect.Base currency is CAD so weaker Yen means it will take more yen to buy 1 Cad. Weaker Yen means Any pair that has XXX/JPY will go up and reverse true. So CAD/JPY will go up if Yen continues to weaken. We will see how markets react next week.I am short on CAD/JPY myself I suggest you read little about base currency

--- 帖子 #873 ---
CAD/JPY close is actually Bearish Tiny Bull candle is engulfed by Bear candle before it.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Good morning Davit Did you catch this one by chance. I found it interesting. http://www.marctomarket.com/2014/08/...technical.html EDIT: And oh, I knew what you meant (YEN being sold) but by your wording above, I can see why some readers may have been confused to thinking you meant the "yen" is bullish.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
GM Chris What do you make out of the article.Your view? My view is that market is positioning Oct QE end as Feds promised and 6-8months later interest rate hike.During this entire process we could see prolonged USD gains unless subsequent months data comes out negative then Yellen could keep extending date of IR hike. Only reservation I have all the talking heads are saying 105 Yen is eminent then break out to 110 very possible.Seems too easy.Who is out there making millions based on what CNBC is saying.... Guppy inventor of Guppy averages predicts 106 then very sharp drop.He gets my vote... funny guy http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000305549# .

--- 帖子 #876 ---
You are right.My wording was confusing.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Well, as you know fundamentals have never been my strong point and I'm still trying to learn more but as I interpret it, it would seem the dollar is poised to keep gaining strength against everything but the sterling. (Basically it's just now catching up to all that good data recently) Still, confidence in it "sustaining" those gains is weak but it seems that's the flow as of now for investors. So I can see more upside for the dollar. Obviously the YEN is not seen as a very good risk at this point and large short orders seem to in place. Although I expect some retrace on most XXX/JPY pairs, they'll be short lived. This "possibly" excludes the EUR/JPY for obvious reasons concerning the EUR. Basically my take is it agrees with what we already see in the charts. EU has more downside to at least my target of 1.31038. If that fails to hold 1.27576 is next major SR. GU I still expect to rise from "around" here to at least 6900. Probably more but we'll see at that point. UJ is certainly going to gain over the rest of this year. 105 next stop but I'm pretty sure we'll slightly higher as well. 110? I don't think so. The CAD is a trick shot right now at about 50/50. Movement in CAD pairs will largely depend on their counterparts me thinks. At least near term. What's your take from the article? EDIT: Never mind I see you added to your post.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Yeah lot's of folks refer to UJ as the YEN. Used to confuse me too when I'd read the "yen" is weak or strong but they actually meant UJ is weak or strong. lol

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I have a question though. What's your (or anyone else's) take on the COT? I read much from many and it seems folks either swear by it or against it. There never seems to be much middle ground on the opinions to it's accuracy.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Its interesting perhaps how so many of us underestimated Last Feds announcement.Now it looks lot of big guns were waiting to unload on cue. I am very curious how Sept shapes. If ECB goes with QE 1.25 Euro is not out of question (with USD interest rate hike almost guaranteed EU under 1.30)finally all the negative fundamentals can't be ignored anymore by EZ specially extreme high unemployment and lack of growth. In this context continued depreciation of Euro added Ukraine crises on top of it will drag GU lower as well.I am not ready to long GU yet. Deutsche Bank's Major Currency Forecasts Little extreme and way off on Yen,GU and EU but in general correct on downtrend Interesting that they view Dollar being the king in coming months. Note that both EU and GU are significantly lower but also note EG is only 300pips range suggesting they don't see significant Pound gain. http://www.efxnews.com/sites/default...c13_2/m117.PNG I still have their original PDF when I started shorting EU from 139.I wished I never exited those trades!!! Regards

--- 帖子 #881 ---
I agree with all except GU. But I know how you trade and I would agree that going long is not right for your method yet. The longs I'm building are carry trades. As I've posted, my plan allows for further drop to add more to it. In fact if it keeps rising from here (possible) then the 6900 target is all I'd expect. If it drops to 6520/6460 or so (also possible), I'd expect to see 7100 or more. This is longer term for me. I've been wanting to get into position trading for a very long time now. This is actually my first shot at it. ... lol EDIT: LOL ... I need to wait longer before replying as you keep adding to your posts. That chart is a bit extreme for sure and I think folks are placing WAY too much emphasis on the "old" correlation between the EU and GU. I can easily see EU falling while GU rises. I'm not saying the correlation is over with, but as of now (and for some time) it's certainly not so tight.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
I am inclined to believe 1618 fib is gonna get hit on GU 6384 Notice cluster is not breaking north Closer look shows Friday close was lower then previous close suggesting strong selling

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Well our bars are quite a bit different. But that aside, let's see what happens when the market actually starts trading again. I find it rather funny so many folks are trying to analyze price over the last two weeks of August. Normally, I don't even trade the month at all as from a TA perspective, I've never found the data on the charts to be very accurate. However, if it hits that extension, not only will I be out of my longs, but I'll eat my hat too. The picture as I see it now and for the past couple weeks. We'll see.

Its very possible BOE raise interest rates sooner then Feds although this will become unlikely if Euro continues to drop. EZ is still UK biggest trading partner.I don't see how Euro falling will not effect the Pound. I will join you long term longs on cable in much lower numbers but as anything market can prove anyone wrong that includes me as well . Regards

--- 帖子 #885 ---
I don't think there's any question of it actually. Just look at what an interest rate hike would do to our debt. We're having a tough enough time just covering the interest on it. So unless the FED wants to completely collapse our economy (possibly? LOL) there's no way they can raise rates. At least not this year. Probably next as well but who knows what they'll do. But yes, either of us could be wrong for sure.

Hi, nice to read this thread some times. Usd/jpy - Everyone talks that sentiment is bullish, but in my view this pair is highly corellated with US 2 and 10 year bonds. So I have overall target at 94 - 96. Also I saw COT report, which data I trade earlier. There are insane numbers of institutional long orders. So I have an idea that eur/usd can climb up a lot. Maibe in a long period will go lower, but some good retracement is a must. Just some Ideas.

Nice on the EUR/JPY. I never did take up any new positions. I should have taken advantage of the ECB easing leak once it was confirmed by Reuters and Zero Hedge and shorted Euro heavy but I played it safe and stuck with my existing trades. I'd gotten out of my EUR/AUD short when it hit the 100% retracement again at 1.404 and set a new short entry at 1.406, but it only got to 1.40575 when the ECB easing program was leaked so I missed the first drop. I got in on the first bounce at 1.3955, out at 1.385, now back in at 1.390 -- I figure 1.385 is good for another hit and that makes up for half the profit I didn't make from the initial drop and that's good enough I suppose. I finally ate the loss and exited my AUD/NZD short around 1.122 and re-entered short at 1.250. Hopefully we're right and it finally pulls back because I rode that the wrong way far too long. Having said that, here it is back up at 1.250 again after I was reassured by the move down to 1.123 that it was going to behave this time. Oh well, that's how it goes sometimes. Except for my gold long, which I had to re-enter because of a stupid data spike (only cost me $50 to get back in, but it's the principle of the matter), that's all I'm trading today. I'll let things resolve themselves over the course of the day, or maybe just call it a week rather than mess around with non-farm payrolls out tomorrow. That's the nice thing about this business -- you can trade whenever you feel like it because there will always be new opportunities if you're patient.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Hi KADC It was obvious ECB was going to take action.That's why I piled my shorts on EJ. Draghi repeatedly said low inflation was a concern plus extreme high unemployment. Aussie is getting money from Euro now. Its "save heaven" I may pull the plug on AN and AJ by 1pm today if it continues in red.Need to know how both behave after London.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
If the Canadian employment data tomorrow is positive and can push USD/CAD below 1.08, I think I'll pile on some Canadian long trades as it's currently outperforming all the other minors. That would push weekly USD/CAD RSI below 50 (sitting there now and pointing down) with trendline support at 1.0725 and the 38.2% Fibonacci at prior price support at 1.0615 which is a cleaner looking destination than AUD/USD which is in the middle of its consolidation range and the NZD/USD which is hanging out in no-man's land. That's not to say I'll play it against USD necessarily, just that USD is my currency barometer. USD/CAD weekly Attached Image (click to enlarge) addendum: I'm taking one more AUD/NZD short at 1.12625 with a tight stop which is Fibonacci confluence with the 200% extension of the prior move down. Failing that, I'll try a new short entry from 1.128 which is the 27.2% extension of the move up from Monday to Wednesday. One good pullback will erase my losses in this pair -- that's not a smart way to trade but it will make me feel better.

GU longs 2x 6347 Be cautious that GU is in parabolic dive but I figure after 122pip dive there must be a reaction.Orders are small.They are my scouts Edit Closed -12pips

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Your reasoning is sound however the tight range has been holding for good while.I suggest wait higher then short. Good data on Cad in the past proven not very effective.This is partly due to oil prices being low Looking at sharp tails on candles suggest any retrace is quickly bought up.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
You could also say that image demonstrates a lower-low followed by a lower-high -- a bearish breakout signal. If USD/CAD breaks below 1.08 tomorrow I don't think it will move back into the consolidation zone. Then again, I didn't think anyone would repeatedly try to force gold down when London was open just after an easing program was announced when they could waited and done it for a fraction of the cost during the Asian session, so what do I know.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
GU already hit your target Davit

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Few painful observation about my trading. Exiting winning positions way too quickly. (80-100pips) I had 10 shorts on EU from 37 and another 10-12 on GU from 171-170 Exited both way too early.Euro alone would of quadrupled my account by now.Lesson here is if you happen to get on a great trend stay on!! I should of rolled back the stops and let these trades pile in the money. I am painfully aware.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Hi Davit What is your view on EU and GU now? Both seem to have reached oversold areas Appreciate the input

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Hmmm - at the end that is more a question of fundamentals. Overbought ? So what ! The PA may run and run and run .... the trends may last longer then we may imagine !

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Agreed, and hence why I am so nervous... I have so many long EU and GU positions, wondering when this market can take a turn around

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi Davit nobody knows the final target n where it will start rebounding .....bcz today's forex market is just not anout fundamentals or technicals but Geopolitical news is also affecting big way.... I can assure u that if Scotland topic would have not been here around .... we all would be seeing GU at around 167 currently.... I was reading ur post in cable ... u wrote that GU is closing to its bottom n will see rebound from current levels .... just curious to know did u consider scotland issue in ur analysis bcz if there is yes voting for this issue then GU may go down to atleast 1.625 but not beyond that bcz scotland issue is already factored in the market.... Bottom line I m not seeing much downside from here max 16250 .... i hope we will rebound bcz m stuck with heavy long positions at 170... All the best

--- 帖子 #927 ---
@thobien @Davit Testing the bot (p. 44, post 862 ff) I got now during this week a few trades - so far so good. The most importent question is of course: is the bot trading accordingly to the systems rules ? What's your thoughts, ideas ? http://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGTF...tem-tf/1008714

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Hi BT In my view Euro could go lower 1.28-27 then rebound higher.Lot depends also how US fundamentals shape up. August NFP was decimal way under 200k jobs.Feds like to see 250k+ to start thinking interest rate hike.If the number comes out below 200k or even 200k in Oct then we could see major bounce on all majors against USD GU looks stronger then Euro.Had you followed my system you would of not longer GU or EU at all.I showed and talked why so. Cheers

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Hi Rocky Yes I wrote about Scotland vote.I am aware.I think GU is strongest fundamentally to bounce lot higher.As far as you holding longs from 1.70 wow....I was selling heavy on same number.... We might be seeing the bottom and your account might just survive. REgards

--- 帖子 #930 ---
One of My worst decision in recent time and I would not deny that its hurting me now but I hope i will be able to survive provided GU will not go below 160 n must rebound to 170 in coming months ... however I have this opinion that USD has its strong run but it will not last long ... as NFP shown some real loopholes in Data to come next .... For me usd will remain strong MAX till SEPT month ...that too doubtful Thanks Davit for ur inputs ...

To be precise ... it has gone to 1.0820 level 3 to 4 times in last three weeks ... so if it brake 1.0850 this time again after breaching 0880 then quite strong chances to go to 1.0770 this time ... usd is strong but CAD is not weak ... let see wait n watch ...

You know what davit .... I tried reaching u many times when GU was at around 171 ... bcz that time i had many heavy shorts ranging from 164 to 167 ...Standing at 171 many were saying it will got 173 or 175 due to rate hike ...so i thought of hedging it so that m margin money will not go down and at the same time ii will make some profit ... i did my analysis but all went wrong ... If i could have managed to speak to u that time i guess i would have never taken long positions at that level ....y i was approaching u bcz i knew that u also got stuck with sell positions as i had been reading ur blogs in cable n realized that u have done some extensive research on it anyways let the bygones b bygones ... looking forward to GU to atleast 170 ...bcz m actually scared now bcz of scotland issue....

Looks a bit dangerous to me. A weekly close above 1.0971 area looks like higher prices ahead.

Hi SRT Trading is just probability game. What do we know about true USD strength.Not much.Empty hollow BS from Yellen and lousy unemployment from August. In fact there is nothing concrete about USD "recovery" Its typical impulse move.If I am wrong I'll get out but that's trading every time you take a position there is inherent risk.There is no such a thing as "safe" trading.

LOL... good thing it's a straw hat. A tad dry but easier to digest. GULP!

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Living in the US, what makes me think differently this time about the US$ strength is that there's more talk from fed officials that think interest rates should be raised sooner rather than later so I think this time the rate-hike talk is more than just talk. Pretty volatile markets these days so you'll probably get your pullback or reversal.

Hi Alorente, Appreciate the warning but, I'm short from 0.92337. Just banked 50% at 0.91355 and will reload on a successful test of 0.91611 to 0.91810. My charts above show the short and explain why. I agree about the daily AND weekly neckline as shown on my charts. But more than the neckline, the break of the range base was telling. Falling from this long term range was all but a sure thing on recent PA. I was asking pips777 if he/she was building longs. Seemed .... dangerous to me at those levels which is why I posted the charts.

Hello Dave. There is a great chance of a turn around at the top side of the weekly rising wedge around 107 to 107.30. Notice also the major divergences showing in the TSI at bottom. After that, if wedge is broken on downside, target is around 88, which would be a 0.618 retracement of the entire move up. We will know in the next few days.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
I got out because with Feds 17th meeting coming up I have no idea what Yellen might say.Good chance she will be bullish confirm QE end in Octumber which will accelirate UJ upthrust to 108 and then we might have some correction. Yen is basically managed currency by BOJ hence they have the resources to blast this crap up against any technical factor. Its basically trading up on fundamentals anticipating slowing Japan economy which is already taking place and US interest rate looming in 2015 spring.. In light of these fundemetal factors I'll skip trading Yen all together. What is more interesting that Aussie despite of progressive green numbers is getting killed.That to me is raising eye brows Regards

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Good morning amigo, I’ve been suffering myself on just about everything I touch at the moment. Although I’m still in UJ and just added for the last throw of the dice at 6095/1.618. Will give it just a little room before accepting the loss. There seems to be a sort recalibration of the forex landscape going on. It reminds me of the film a Inception where cities would crumble and be re-formed. In this environment my skills are proving useless. I run with my swag but each old escape route has become a dead end. But it’s swings and round-a-abouts. My time will come again. Maybe today or tomorrow. Mark Douglas says that when you have a run of losers it’s amazing how often it’s followed by a long run of winners to somehow keep the win/loss ratio where it should be. I’ve noticed it too but of course you have to take the trades for it to work. Hasta luego and bon chance

--- 帖子 #974 ---
My mistake was hanging on to UJ way too long.That's just inexcusable. I think waiting until after Sept 17th is wise. I get the feeling that Yellen might get dovish because USD got too strong way too fast rattling markets from stocks ,gold,oil. Anyway life goes on and its all learning lessons. Best regards

--- 帖子 #975 ---
same here davit! had a nice 4 figure DD on YEN, already cut some positions, when looking back we see often such movements on Yen, they get corrected to 0.61 to 0.76 most of the time. So als long as the weekly wedge hold (hopefully thats not a continuation one)... i´ll add until the acending line is broken and retested from above! prefered scenario for me (09.10 was fullmoon) is the start of a proper retracement in this weeks i keep an eye on friday regards thodie

--- 帖子 #976 ---
I don´t worry about what the trigger would be. Yellen, Geopolitical crisis, earthquake, whatever. The story is contained in the chart. That rising weekly wedge is very important as well as the TSI divergence. Also, the Green Weekly TMA is way above the Brown Monthly TMA. The weekly will have to make its way back to the other side of the monthly. That´s the way TMA´s move, from side to side of the larger TMA. The AudUsd is another example of fundamentals giving way to the technicals on the chart. All the Aussie numbers are green, very strong and yet, the H and S pattern has broken the neckline and AU continues to fall as the chart indicates it should.
