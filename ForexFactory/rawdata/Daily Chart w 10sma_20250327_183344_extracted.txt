As my trading evolves I keep looking for easier ways to trade with less confusion and frustration. I have mainly used trendlines and s/r areas in the past. This has improved my trading over the years but I want to show you what I am doing now and I hope you will find this useful. We all trade with different time frames and exspectations. This is by far the simplest thing I have ever used and takes the guess work out for me. Are all my trades profitable.....NO!! I do not believe there is a system out there that can accomplish that. I have a few rules I use and I will be posting those rules along with examples to show what the set uo looks like on a chart. I hope you find this interesting and profitable.

always looking to simplify (PROFITABLE) trading

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thanks bkg102665...I'm looking forward to it!!

Simple is good...

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Use a daily chart with most any pair you like to trade.

Put a 10sma on the chart (red on my charts)

Always know where support and resistance levels are(aqua on my charts)because these are always good take profit areas and entry areas

I will only take shorts when price is at resistance level and then closes below the 10sma

I will only take longs when price is at support and then closes above the 10sma

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This a trade I entered short. Price touched my resistance line and then closed below my 10sma. I would be looking to take profit at the lower trend line, the support line, or get out of the trade if price closes back above the 10sma.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Same set up here except I am long

--- 帖子 #7 ---
thanks... I like it.

A couple of questions(which you may already be answering but I'm anxious):

Based on both charts, would it have been a valid signal from a couple of days early when it closed (above/below) the 10SMA - which I believe is yes.

If this is the case, what would the stop loss be?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes the trades I have shown were entered a few days ago. My stop loss would be if a candle closes on the opposite side of my 10sma.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
This is a trade I will be entering if price closes where it is now.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
BTW please feel free to ask questions about this and any currency pair you may be looking at. Just so you know I use IBFX as my broker mainly because their candles along with the 10sma seem to be more reliable than other brokers that may close the day at a different time. I also use FXDD as my second broker but base all my trades off of IBFX charts.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
wow,thats uncanny,I pretty much trade the same as yourself,here's the same chart but with a lines instead or bars or candles,basically I trade 123 set ups then once in trade look for break of s/r areas to add to trend .....simples

--- 帖子 #12 ---
This is an alert I had made that has the ability to alert w/ alarm, a pop up window, and an email. It will alert you when a daily candle crosses and close the 10sma. You will get the alert at the close of the daily candle. I run this on 20+ currencies and every night around 8 pm I get emails to tell me which pairs have crossed the 10sma and closed. Remember that you want to take short trades when price is close to resistance and long trades when price is near support.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Interesting that I came across this thread.  I used to experiment with almost the same trading technique a while back.  Price first had to cross the 9 SMA and the next day the trade was made if/when the price broke the first day's candle instead of at the close of first day's candle as you do.  There is definitely a lot of potential to this simple method if one has a good system to filter your SMA crosses.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Another rule of mine, once you are up 100 pips move your s/l to +5 and let the trade run. Often these trades will run for +500 pips.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi,

When the daily candle breaks through the `ma 10 , for a short trade  enter the trade 1/2 pips below the low of that day,

it give more conformation of the trend.

Also plot an RSI 14 in the chart and draw trendlines of the bottom, when it is broken , it is another conformation

try it and you will see it.

Hi BKG

I have a question if I may. On your AUD/USD chart just posted you say you will short if candle closes where it is now. The thing I dont under stand is that at no time do I see this as a resistance line.If you look to left on your chart around aug1st price came down and bounced at support for about 4days or so, price then went up and came back downaround 8sept and again bounced on support for about 4/5 days then dropped through, made a new low then shot back up going straight through previous support, so no resistance there, price came back down around 11nov and again bounced around support level before dropping through making another low then went back up again straight through previous support level so no resistance there came back down and again bounced 5/6 at same support level and has now dropped through again. So my question is after all that, how do you see this as a resistance area which as you say you will short if candle closes as is ? I only see this as a support area and cannot see any where that price at this level was turned  back and then went down. Any help much appreciated

Many Thanks

Geoff

--- 帖子 #17 ---
hey Dutch can you place a chart.... I get what you mean but good for noobies ,cheers Tedge

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I have remarked my charts and colored the areas where I see this as s/r. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks for reply BKG but all the areas you have remarked on you chart I see as support , where does this become resistance allowing you you take a short?

Geoff

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I am expecting price to come down and close the gap I have high lighted

--- 帖子 #21 ---
As soon as price closes below this support area the the same area becomes resistance.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Interesting... I was already looking to take this same trade short using another method this morning before I saw this method.  The odd thing is my chart does not show the gap.  Is this because I'm using a different broker (Oanda)?  I'm guessing yes...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I would have to guess it is because of the different broker. Does anyone else have the gap I have shown on my chart?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thanks... Yeah, that's it... I installed a demo of IBFX and it looks like yours.  I've been thinking about switching over to them for a while now.  Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Just to give you guys a little info on me. I live in eastern N.C. here in the great ole U.S.A. and I have been trading for probably 10+ years now. I started out trading stock options and really got my ass burned doing that. Some trading friends of mine told me I should try forex so back in 05 I decided to give it a try. I have been addicted ever since. Spent the first 4 or 5 years trying to trade the 15m chart but with no consistancy. Moved to 1hr then 4hr but really like trading the daily. I work a public job so it makes it much easier to trade the daily and a lot less stressful in my opinion. I lost my business and everything I owned in the 09 Depression(lol) and I made a promise to myself and God that if I ever figured out how to trade and be profitable I would pass on what I have learned for free to whoever would listen so hear I am. If I can help do not hesitate to ask me please.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Yep I have the same Gap on FXPro and FXDD

--- 帖子 #27 ---
If we get some 10sma crosses tonight I will post the chart and tell you why I would take the trade or why I would not take the trade. That should be another hour or so.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi BKG,

Thank you for sharing your simple system. How you draw your S/R lines? Which TFs S/R levels you use? If your are using an S/R indicator could you please share it with its settings.

Thanks in advance.

Roy

--- 帖子 #29 ---
All the charts I post will be daily charts. All of my s/r levels I do manually. I have never seen a good indicator for that. Most people see support and resistance areas a little different but all in all we should all be pretty close. Some people use wicks but all of my s/r lines will be based off of the candle bodies, not the wicks/

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hello bkg102665

Thanks for sharing, please what pairs are the best for this system?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
It works on most pairs but I suggest you do some back testing if it is a really odd pair.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
aud/chf = No Not much room to reach support so probably not

aud/usd = I took it but you may get a better price if it backs up a little

eur/chf = Probably a nice trade with room to run 200+

gbp/usd = No too close to support

nzd/chf = Possibly a nice trade back to the 200sma(yellow)

usd/jpy = No too close to resistance

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi bkg,

Thanks for sharing.

From what I read through the first few pages, can I assume you do not have any hard SL when you opened the trade? When a position is opened, you manage it on a daily basis. As an example, if you have a short position on AU now which is opened today, then on a daily basis you look at where it closes and when it does close above the SMA, that is when you close the position irrespective of whether it is in profit or not.

Not sure if I have read it correctly because without a initial SL (risk) it will be difficult to determine a good position size.

Thanks and regards,

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi BKG,

Thanks for your reply.

Roy

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I use the same methodology but on a TF of 8H and above.  I went long on clear close above SMA (yellow line) and now waiting to clear the resistance of 1.556 to add further positions.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
You are correct. If price closes above 10sma then I am out. You can never be wrong putting an initial s/l though. It is risky if you do not.I would advise putting a 200 pip s/l just in case something drastic happens and price changes direction.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
It is time for this old man to go to bed. I will be back tomorrow morning to talk about what has happened through the night. Trade well folks!!!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi BKG,

Thanks for the reply. I do agree the SL is used for emergency stops because it looks like the SMA line does provide a good exit.

One question, when all conditions met, do you enter upon close of the candle or using a pending order on the high/low for buy/sell whichever the case maybe.

regards,

--- 帖子 #39 ---
BKG:  How does one add one's e-mail address to this indicator?  Thank you. . .

hi there

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Good morning. Not much has happened over night it loks like. I figured we may get some pullback after yesterdays nice moves.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
As pah has said you must go to your mt4 charts, go to the tools tab in upper left corner, click tools, then options, then email. You have to fill in the information and then check the enable box. If you have trouble I will be glad to help more. If you need help pm me and I will try to walk you through it.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Just a suggestion to the newbies here, fed statement comes out at 2:15 today so have s/l in place. Who knows what they might say or how the market may react.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
As I said last night I was expecting the aud/usd to pull back some. This could be a nice place to enter a short.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi BKG,

Took your advice on the AUDUSD , and the GBPUSD and waited for the pullback to enter , and my contribution(the way I trade)  if it helps new traders on your thread ( because I really understand where you are coming from) is to fib larger signal candles in this type of trading to get a discount (better price) on entry and let price climb up( or fall down if reversed)  to the 50/61.8 fib and have a limit order waiting on it.  You will miss a few trades in a fast moving market but in this type of trading (Lower volume) you will get a nice discount on your trades.  ( Chart is of the GBPUSD Daily 12/13/11)

Take Care

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I agree 100%. I like to let it go back to the 50% range to get in but I got in early last night mainly just to show people how I trade. A better price would have been nice and you made a great entry short. The AUD is still trying to be a little stubborn this morning though.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks for your kindness, bkg.

Pls. keep posting.

This should be a good thread...

SIMPLE to understand

EASY to trade

Will frequent often.

IMHO, check your lower tf, likely to find the gap as fx runs 24 hr.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #50 ---
This is a trade I entered on my FXDD account. The candle closed below the 10sma then when back and touched the 10sma and I entered at that point.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Draw trendline from the lows and  look for a price what close below it.

ad an RSI 14 and draw trendline of the lows of the RSI and look when RSI broke the trendline

see chart in gbp/usd.

go short 2 pips below the signalcandle

Stoploss 1 or 2 ATR

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Entered trades on two pair yesterday evening around 8:00pm.  Each pair retraced and I entered additional positions.  I like the simplicity of this method. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This way of trading is just sooooo stress free

thanks for indi BKG

--- 帖子 #54 ---
No problem, glad you got it loaded ok!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I only see two of the pairs I look at crossing the 10sma tonight.

aud/chf = No because I just do not like the way it has set up.

eur/aud = No because it has crossed headed down at or around previous support.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Would you enter the trade if there is any follow through?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I do not think I would. I have learned over the years I do not have to be in a trade all the time. Be patient and your set up will happen. The worst mistakes I have made trading is trying to force a trade. Often I would look at a pair and would see a great entry spot but it may stall before it got there, I would go ahead and jump in, only to have it go where I knew I should have waited for it to go.

PATIENCE is the key to any forex style of trading.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks bkg102665 - That's probably been my biggest problem so far trading Forex.  I started writing a list of my own rules with #1 being PATIENCE...

Well so far so good, as I did go short on AUDUSD last night and I'm up 42 pips right now.  I saw before the comments earlier about getting in at a better price... Does this happen often?  My thought is with the daily chart it probably pulls back more frequently than trading the shorter timeframes.  I think in the future, I may enter the trade on the close below (or above) the SMA and then add to my position IF it pulls back like it did today...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
You meant you did not when until the candle closed and took a short?

If so, how sure you were when the price moved back down from the 10sma that it would just go down till candle closing?

The price could bound back over the 10sma, could't it?

Just want to see how you make entry?

cheers

--- 帖子 #60 ---
First let me say I am never sure about any trade and nobody can be. It was just a chance I was willing to take and if price had kept going up and closed above the 10sma I would have taken my loss and got out. Its no big deal to have a loss because we all do and we always will. It is all about minimal losses and maximize your winning trades.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
OK. With MM your trades should be fine.

A read senior trader said that with a good mm for just 1 to 2 RR and even at a 40% or 50% win rate, one will be in good hand for profit in a long term.

IMHO.

Is it necessary to have the red HLines and yellow 200MA?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I like using fibo ema's for S and R. So i just got in on a sell for gbp/usd.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
The red trend lines and 200sma are not necessary but I just like to know where the 200sma is because it is powerful and can turn or stall price. Often I will use it for t/p area.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Fibs are fine if you like them but I could never figure which one price may turn on. If I thought it would turn on 38 it would run to the 50. If I waited for the 50 it would keep going to the 68 and if I waited for the 68 it would turn on the 38 or 50.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I just took my self out of trade. It was close to my support area and I was up 340 pips so I am pleased.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
nice trade bkg,i'm still in this baby right to the bottom (hopefully)

Tedge

--- 帖子 #69 ---
You are correct. That is what happens. The bigger ema's are the most significant for turning points.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
nice system. only issue is the entry region. sometimes i notice there is 100pip+ drawdown before going in your direction. this is because breakout candles are usually large and can succumb to retracement. sometimes there is no drawdown and it just drops. sometimes it will reverse and hit SL. those are the 3 options as long as wins are large should be fine

also i notice on tedge's chart ranging market on daily is tough on this system

also there arent too many good signals, on tedge's chart about 4 signals per few months per instrument and a lot of whipsaws in the beginning.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
This system works well for me :-)) You have to know where s/r areas are, very important!! If you are near support you only take long signals and at resistance you only take short signals. It has worked well for me in the past and continues to do well. You can not change or modify the rules or you will get burned. I still have losses and I would assume your system does as well. If it does not then please share.....lol.

I am not trying to push this on anyone just trying to share what I know to be true.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Tedge, I'm in that aususd trade also. Where do you think the bottom is going to be

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Just closed this GBP trade for 135 pips for the same reasons you closed the EJ BKG, it looks like it is stalling at a support area.  Actually tightening the stops on most of my trades and will try to be flat by first of the week going into the xmas break.  Your trade system works really well BKG. thanks again

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I am also confused but respect traders can make entries out of Fib. I only use it for 50%!

Dont have to wait the candle cross up the 10 SMA. Use S&R to exit. OK.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for sharing your system with us. Could you give me some valuable tips on determining support an resistance spots?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
No you do not have to wait for it to cross going back up to get out if you are in positive pips. I will normally take my profit at a s/r level or a lot of times the 200sma may get me out.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi BKG,

One dumb question! Approximaely, how many pips close you consider as 'nearer' to S/R levels.

Thanks.

Here are three possible t/p areas in gray

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks for sharing. I was looking for a system to try out on my first demo account, stressfree and simple sounds perfect for me.

Seeing as this is a daily chart, I should be expecting to hang on to a position for around 5-7 days, correct? I realize I need to exit when a short nears the support or a long nears resistance despite how long I've had the position, but I mean as an average.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi bkg, I was just looking at the charts and the gbp/jpy pair looks like a possible trade. Could you give me your input on what you think of it? thanks

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Paul, thank you.  I'm writing back to help a little more since I needed more help than the MT4's Tools/Options/Email "help" tab could give me.  One can get the information needed for that Email form through your ISP - in my case, hawaii.rr.com.  My understanding is that alerts are sent right into the Journal section on the MT4.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
i will be taking some off at 9700

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thanks so much, bkg.

I guess finding support/resistance is the key here. Could you please give us more rules about this, or more example charts? And, any difference when finding S/R in other timeframe chart?

Hello i come to your system and find very simple and effective.

thanks for this.

Can you please help me how to find the support and resistance?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi bkg102665,

Really interested in your strategies, & want to learn from you. But i really not good at observing the charts.

Do you assist me by writing out the rules of this strategies, & the ever important of how to define the suppport & resistance lines? I tend to define more or most of the time different from others.

Thank you, & awaiting for your assistance.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I decided to go long here. Price is above support and has came down close to the 10sma.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I am usually in my trades anywhere from 3 to 5 days. If I see reversal candle I may get out sooner but not usually.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
The trade should have been entered in the gray area closer to resistance. It may possibly be a good trade from here but I would not take it here. If I miss the original entry I normally wait for another set uo. I have marked possible t/p area with red lines.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
bkg, have you tried the Demark trendline indi? It lets you know when there is a break and it also has profit targets. btw that gbp/jpy trade there was a break below....right after a close below the 10sma.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
No I have not but if you send me the indi I will take a look at it. I just find that I usually do better if I look at things myself but I will be glad to look at it.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi bkg, I took a eurchf trade and lost 48 pips so I went back an looked at the charts to see if I missed something and the only thing I could possibly think of was that the 10sma was still going up and I was taking a short. Should the 10sma be moving in the same direction as your trade meaning if I am going short should the 10sma be going down? Thanks

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Just go to codebase mt4 indi and type demark trendline trader to check it out.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Tell me more about your trade.At what price did you get in long or short, what was your s/l ?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
If you entered in the gray area I probably would not have got out of the trade unless price closed above the blue line. Often when price and the 10sma get near support or resistance price will stall and maybe cross the 10sma several times before moving. That is why knowing where s/r levels are is so important. You will get it if you keep looking and listening. Please be trading this on a demo account until you become more familiar and comfortable with this trading style.

I know the candle closed above the 10sma and that is probably why you got out. When a candle closes full or no wick near s/r areas that often means price is fixing to move in the opposite direction so I would have stayed in this trade.

Did you have a predetermined s/l or did you get out because it crossed back above the 10sma?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thank you for responding to my post. I took the eurchf trade @ 1.2328 with a sl @ 1.2415. I then closed the trade @ 1.2376 after it closed above the 10sma. Was this the proper way to handle it?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
sorry bkg i just saw and read your explanation on post 94. on your chart the candle that closed above the 10sma had no upper wick but on my chart it did have an upper wick. i'll have to learn to read the candles closer and be more patience. again thank you

--- 帖子 #97 ---
BKG

If you happen to have some charts regarding the above, it's good to illustrate for easy understanding

Thanks, pal.

What would be the stop loss here?  If it closes below the 10SMA?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
You can see my s/l has been put in place which is the red line. I usually place it below the support line and move it up as the 10sma moves up.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
interesting system. re GBPCHF, i notice you waited for a retracement, rather than buy immediate breakout. how do we know the retracement doesnt turn into a reversal, as on daily chart pip ranges are large.

also fundamentals - SNB failed to intervene as market hoped, so there is less downside to CHF

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Oops... Missed that - Thanks!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
testing support,this is where big balls comes into play

--- 帖子 #105 ---
We never KNOW what will happen we have to make good educated guesses.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Something else I have learned is I pay no attention to news. It can change the market but normally that is short term stuff. I just play what I see on my charts. I may be 100% wrong about my gbp/chf trade but it a chance I am willing to take. It has come down to test previous s/r area so I am long. If it closes below my s/r blue line I will take my loss and move on to the next trade. Losses are a part of trading and you better get comfortable with that or you will never succeed at trading. Trust your gut feelings not mine.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I see BKG basically following his trading method which is good = DISCIPLINE!

Unless ones are fundamental player like G Soro, W Buffet, I have read seniors advised to stick to the trading plans, just my 2 cents

p.s. BTW why would SNB want to intervene? Wasn't that Swiss wanted to soften their 'overheated' Franc for the past 10 years?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I went long on this trade though today's candle appearing to be doji.  However, the price is holding 1.300 so far so let's how it unfolds.

Hello everyone. I hope everyone is ready for a good week of trading. Volume will probably be thin this week so not sure if much will happen since the next two weeks are filled with holiday activities. We will trade if something interesting presents itself.

See if EUR will step on 10SMA.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Funny you should sy that, I did trade it. I was short on it but reversed and went long. I did not mention it because it is not my typical trade set up. I have my t/p marked as you can see.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
The TP is set there because it's in a downtrend, correct? So far I don't have one because I have no idea how to set it in MBT desktop, but hey that's what demo accounts are for.

What were the reasons you traded it despite it not being your typical setup?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Would this be a valid trade LONG using this method as long as the close today stays where it is above the 10SMA?  Or is the risk vs reward based on your target not worth it.

While I want to go long with this trade, logic tells me that I would have needed to get in earlier.

Good point TedgeUK... I need to be a little more diligent with watching the different pairs.  I tend to stick to 4 or 5  and miss many opportunities.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
The trade looks good for now but keep your eye on it. Much rather be long here than short.

Move your s/l to +5 and let it ride to your t/p target. This way it is a no loss trade and all your stress is cone.

Go back and look at the weekly candle for this pair from last week. It has a long top wick which often means reversal is coming so just be careful with this one.

yh I see what you mean bkg,but what swung it for me was yesterdays almost pin bar

--- 帖子 #126 ---
That is true but just remember your larger time frame (weekly pinbar) will trump the daily pinbar usually. I look for price to go up the weekly wick and the possibly reverse. It may not happen that way but just be careful.

What do you mean, exactly? I set a trailing stop of 10 pips.

I went long on EUR/USD @ 1,311680 even though I clearly typed 1,317815 into the limit order box. What do you think of this trade? Why is it good or bad? (originally I set the open price @ 1,317815 because that way it would be just above 10SMA).

MBT is pretty much impossible to use, I can't imagine ever using this with real money. So tomorrow I'm going to switch to a different broker that allows demo.

merry xmas and happy new year all.

Hope everyone ready for trading next week....Happy new year everyone

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hey guys I hope everyone had a nice new year. I have been busy this week closing out the year end at work but I hope to be back in here next week with you talking, trading, and learning!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I picked up around 320 pips this week closing a eur/jpy and eur/usd trade. I will get back to showing my trades next week hopefully. I hope you have not gotten lonely and left the thread, see next week!! I also tried a cad/jpy trade but it would just not drop so I got out with about 2 pips on that trade.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hey BKG et al., Happy New Year!!! I haven't been watching any charts this week, but I will definitely take a look at those pairs.  See you next week...

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I've been studying this method with interest. Looks like a great method for the working guy. Taking a demo trade long - USDCAD with TDI cross as well as MA10 cross. Not sure about holding over the weekend? Any comments from those with more experience?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I just went long on this as well. Be careful of the wedge forming(red trenlines).

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Looking to get maybe 150 pips out of this. I would exit the trade if it closes below the 10sma or if it reaches the red trendline.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Good system BKG... thanks for sharing.

I really like the simplicity and the low stress of trading the daily charts.

I was wondering if you have tried using the 100 SMA on your charts? It seems to be good for S/R.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks for your method.

But in this trade the s/r are far away so how to decide if we should take the trade?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
USD/CAD long position???

--- 帖子 #147 ---
so i mean

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanx for the trendline heads up. Also realized NFP Friday so could be hectic. Don't think I'd trade real $$ but will leave the demo run.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
bkg102665 and other who are follow this thread.

This system works well , I trade this for several years, the way you trade is the agrissive way,
You can filter a lot of signals and that saves money.

1. put an ema 100/or 200 in the chart , above 200 only long and vice versa/
2. when price break sma or ema 10. put an limit order at the low of the signalcandle.
use stops and exits with fibonacchi or Atr.

see example where you can filter 2 false signals

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I do use a 200sma but not 100sma but I am sure it will help. We all must adjust my system to your style.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
It crossed the 10sma up so I decided to take it. I am not expecting much but we will see....

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Yes long. It is not the greatest example of my trading but I took it. You can clearly see on your chart that we have been in a sideways to up trend so I took the signal long. We will see what happens.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I have locked in s/l at +1 so we will see where it goes from here. It is a no loss trade now with no stress!!

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thank you BKG for your sharing, Im trying it out with a demo account and it looks good.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I am outta here guys. Have a great weekend!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Yes I am at +79 on market close. I think I should lock at least +20 pips

--- 帖子 #157 ---
long usacad also +63

--- 帖子 #158 ---
thx for sharing this nice strategy, was my first trade and bummm :-)

i closed half position after 50 pips rest @ end of the day because weekend so i want be flat

nice weekend

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I've been following this thread and found it very useful and user friendly. Here is one of the case i have.

From below xau chart, i found my entry to buy is not good

1. because SMA 200 and SMA 10 is not sync ( if sma 10 below sma 200 we should only sell) but the sma 10 suggest buy

2. the biggest reason for making it a bad trade is because the entry is tooo close S/R aprox : 50 pips

3. The close candle makes it a reversal sign ( inverted hammer ) and also possible double top pattern.

4. i was late to make the entry ( i just found out about this thread few days ago)

That's my humble opinion. What do you think? Thank you

Hi, I am new to the posting stuff but been a silent follower of this thread and forexfactory. I would of entered on the first candle cross. I noticed people using the 100 or 200 day moving average but i noticed from some of your other red arrows you could of made pips going agsinst the 100 or 200 day moving average. So if you can makes pips going against it why does some people say trade with it.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
[quote=shane s;5276742]
Thank you for your reply shane, i was thinking if it breaks the SMA200 that's gonna be my TP and if it going well i'll continue to go to the the red arrow on top.

Thanks, Other opinions are most welcomed

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I would be looking to play shorts on this right now for sure.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
[quote=shane s;5276742]
I will not let the 100 or 200 keep me from entering a trade as long as my entry is 100 pips or more away from the 100 or 200sma. I often use the 200sma as a place to take profit or at least move my s/l to +5 or whatever you like. Personally I do not use a 100sma only a 200sma.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hey bullbearies , How do I post my trades and highlight quotes with the blue boxes. Sorry I am new hear.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
There's a little "quote sign" above  the pages number. Use it. you'll see like this

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Why short sir bkg? the sma 10 suggest otherwise.

If i want to play smaller time frame to H1 or H4 how do i adjust the value of your indicator?

Thank you sir

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I am now short nzd/jpy. See chart below.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
My thought here is that the 200sma is close and it has been in a downtrend so I believe the risk reward would be in a short play. Be patient and wait for the short signal. I could be wrong but it looks like shorts would be a bigger reward at this particular time to me.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
You should not have to change the indicator. Just drag it on a smaller timeframe chart w/ a 10sma and it will work the same.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
See chart below

--- 帖子 #171 ---
So the SMA 10 indicator is MTF. That's great. Thank you sir

Hi bkg,

Thanks so much for sharing your system. I trade off the higher timeframes as well and will be hoping to chill with you guys here over the next year!

I was just wondering whether you are planning on closing out the AUD/USD trade or going to hold onto it.

Many thanks for sharing.

JPR.

I am still holding my trades at this point only because they did not close above resistance areas I have marked but they are not looking very good right now!!

Here a trade in the  Daily GBP/USD

with entry,stoploss, take profit levels.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
As you can see I took the same trade TWICE!! I closed one out for over 100 pips where I thought we might find support. The second trade is still running and if we close below the blue line on my gbp/usd chart my next area of previous support is down around 1.48200 so hang on and lets see what happens.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
good day to all,

1st...i would like to say thanks the thread owner. it is a very interesting strategy. simple and very effective.

1. Staring at chart once a day.

2. Look at the area of SnR (have to draw it manually)

3. Look if the price play is above or below the SMA (i believe the small sma ie 5 or 10 is good enough, not taking to much data for crossing requirement).

4. take the trades.

enjoy it guys. this strategy is working and its compliment to each other (filtering). SnR and SMA.

again. Thanks thread owner. You Rock!

i would like to become one of your best friend

Thx for sharing this fantastic system. Would you be kind enough to explain how do you get those Aqua color S/R lines?

thx and good luck in trading

N.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Sure! When you grab a horizontal line off of the toolbar and drag it on your chart, right click on it and change the color to aqua.You can just add the attached indicator which needs to be loaded in your expert file and drag it on your chart and the lines will be aqua plus it has a support and resistance number attached to the line which is nice.You can move those two lines where ever you see as support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Did you get it figured out?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Yes it works. Many thx!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
My system uses of SMA 20 and 40 on a daily chart. Following the trend of the moving averages to enter trades.

Has been working great thus far.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Nice Thread, I will follow it with much interest.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thats great. Good luck and trade well!

A bounce of the 20 sma paired with the bullish engulfing candle (01/04/2012) signal to take a long position on USD/CHF and look for exit at the next resistance point.

I like to trade after a full trading day in the US has been completed. Ex. Monday pm or this week Tuesday PM.

So I don't trade every day, I just try to make money and stay consistence.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi om

I like Ma so much.

Would you consider to create a thread to discuss your trading method?

Like how do you make entries with MA20 + MA40?

I sure will frequent there?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #191 ---
sounds like a good idea sniperfxmy.  I try to set something up this week or by next week for sure.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I just took a short position in the CHF/SEK @ 7.2927 looking to for a target at 7.2770.

http://ombletrader.com/archive/jan20...-20/chfsek.jpg

Be careful this pair is know to have extreme pip spread during after hours.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Based off of this thread why did you take the trade?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Earlier I showed that instead of using a daily chart with 10sma I suggest using 20 and 40 sma.

I was also asked to create a separate post where other traders can follow along with my trading strategics. I did not have the time at the moment I enter the above trade, so I posted my trade on this thread.

My target in CHF/SEK was meet 04:18am EST.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
hello, with great respect to all, this thread is for using one ma, the 10. your system of waiting for retrace to enter between two ma is good, but there are many threads, for many time frames here on forex factory about just that....

i like the simple approach of S and R and the 10sma that BKG is teaching here...

thanks!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Just took a short on the USDSEK w/ stop @ 7.05

T.P. open for now.........chart attached

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi BKG, what do you think about the AUDUSD?? Of course, we have to wait the end of the day.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi BKG thanks for this great system and hello all. Will be looking at these three tonight.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
My apologies I didn't mean to take the spotlight away from BKG. I mealy wanted to share my tradings and strategics with fellow trades.  I will refrain from post any further trades using my system on this thread.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
ok, here is trade i took. EurJpy long. I am looking for a steady correction uptowards the 200 sma (green). also, that might be the 4th upwave in downtrend... will encounter strong resistance at psych 100 level...

also, I realize this will depend on how eur does over the next few weeks, and risk sentiment.

Thanks!

Excellent simple system, I've started following with interest.

But how and where to draw the S&R lines. I know it's subjective but are there any general pointers?

Thanks, John

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I think mostof us make this much harder than it has to be. I keep it very simple. I pull up a chart and look for areas where price turned and went in the opposite direction. If price turns down and then goes back and test that same area and turns lower again more than likely that will be my area of resistance. The same holds true for support.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi bkg

How to avoid / minimize range trades like the chart shown?

Thank you for your time.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thanks BKG - I shall follow your charts with interest to compare my S&R lines.

John

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi Everyone,

First of all: Thank you BKG for sharing your system and your answers to the questions!

I've found this thread yesterday, I like it's simplycity, so I join to the followers!

The only set up I can see now is a GBPNZD buy signal. What do you think about that? Price didn't touch the support @~1.9000, but we have a "hammer" candle and if we check the other GPB pairs, there are bullish movements.

Sniperfx: I think it is good to check the slope of SMA10. If it is flat, the price is ranging, so we have to be careful, and wait for large movements before entering a trade. Tight SL (to minimize the loss if we don't catch the begining of the new trend) can help us maybe as well.

Take care,

Greg

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I have support and resistance where you do and I would be more inclined to wait for a short signal on this pair around 1.9540

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Thank you for the answer, BKG! You're right, the next resistance is close, and we're in a downtrend. I'd like to gain not more than 100-150 pips here, but it seems the risk is too large for that small amount.

I've added some more charts and I've found a new setup that seems good: AUDCHF

The price turned back @0.9900 (it is a really old R), and now we have a pullback until SMA10. I'm thinking about a pending sell order @~0.9750. Opinions?

Take care,

Greg

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hassaway,

You can use fractals to see the high and lows , use a trendline and look of price break sma 10.

When the price broke the sma 10 you can use a limitorder 2/3 pips behind the low or a marketorder at the close.

I am already short but at the moment the price is against me, but I have time and the stop is far away.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Notice the engulfing bull candle in circle 1 and then the hammer in circle 2. I will be long on the open of the market unless it opens in a really crazy place. 200sma acting as support as well as my blue support line. I will stay long here unless I have a daily candle close below my blue line.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
LONG!!

Hi BKG.

Thanks for the simple and amazing system

I have e newbie question.  How can I set up so that I get email when candle closes above/ below the 10 SMA?

I am not very good at that.  can you advise please

DD

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Check post 39 page 3

--- 帖子 #217 ---
BKG I have a couple of questions:

1. The yellow line  - is this your 200sma - as mine sits just under the hammer in circle 2? and

2. Based on your explanation above if a cross back of the 10sma occurs and price therefore closes below the 10sma you ignore this. Therfore once in a trade the trade is managed by the S&R lines?

Hope above is clear - thanks for your time.

H

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yes the yellow line is my 200sma.

Once I enter a trade in the support zone and a cross above 10sma you are correct, I then stay in the trade until support is broken. When price gets to a support or resistance level the bulls and the bears will fight and price may move up and down in that area for several days until one side or the other gives. If I am at support I am only looking to play long. If price crosses the 10sma down I will not take it short because support is still holding. I hope I have explained this ok.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
understood thanks for the quick reply

--- 帖子 #220 ---
This style of trading really takes out the noise that 99.9% of traders in this forum is trying to make a buck on.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Definitely, great thread BKG

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Thanks. I have been trading for over ten years and finally realized there is a lot of noise out there. If you can not be successful trading this way you probably will not make it trading. Although this works for me it still may not work for everone, we all see things different. I promised myself once I found something that worked for me I would share it and never ask anyone to pay me a dime.

Keep one thing in mind, if someone is trying to sell you a system for trading they are probably not very successful trading. If they were successful trading they could make all the money they want and not have to sell their system, just my two cents worth.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I totally agree!!

I also followed your previous thread, and I'm learning a lot from you. Thanks for sharing your system.

Most of the time I would wait for the fractal to be broken. But if price is making lower/lows and I would enter @ 61.8

Jer21

I certainly do not want to upset anyone in this thread but I do like to stay on track. Do you have a 10sma on your chart that you use? Or do you just use fractals?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
BKG,

Nice simple system, I'm still short the USDSEK (as posted on Jan 18) to the thread..moving the s/l based on the 10sma.

How many trades will you keep working at one time??

(being that many pairs tend to move in the sme direction, just that some move faster than others).

Jon

--- 帖子 #247 ---
hi bkg

I think it has run up ... e-u

in this case I enter h4, d1 not ... just a little before

saludos

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I will only be in four trades at any one time. I start with one or two and get profit locked on those then I may take up to two more trades if they meet my set up.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Not sure about your question here but I would be looking for a short signal on this pair now.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I have it plotted on the daily, I just post my 4hr chart so others could see a where I enter with minimal risk exposure.

Once the daily candle closes above/below the 10sma, I look for 4hr fractal to be broken convincingly for confirmation that its a valid trend change.

This is a good example on GBP/AUD the daily closed on the 24th above the 10sma but on the 4hr there was only one bullish candle. I would like 3 or more bullish candle for a valid trend change. This was a total fake out and trade avoided.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
which are the 4 pairs you always trade?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
why short ?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Mainly because euro has been in a major sell cycle, we are above the 10sma (so to late to be looking long), and we are close to resistance (daily candle closed full at a critical area).

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hey bkg102665,

How would you handle a trade like this? Bullish candle crossed on the 24th. Where would enter and place your stop?

Do you have a technique to filter out trades? or conditions to be met before entering?

I'm interested in your detailed approach..

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Bkg & Traders

Should one go short on Monday open?

Reason: It is a star formation at the confluence level.

Or to wait for candle go below MA10?

Welcome opinion.

Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
well, i would have thought that since the daily has closed 'above' the 10sma, according to your system, this is a buy signal ?

the 1 hr has formed an inverted hammer, so chances it may fall. but is the daily signal iverall not a buy, as closed above 10sma ?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
It closed above the 10sma on Jan 17, that is when you should have went long. If you had you would be up 475 pips today.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I would wait for a cross below 10sma. If I was going to take it before the cross of the 10sma I would have taken it up at resistance which is in the area of the star.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I am current long this pair and I'm planning to hold it for a couple of months until price action proves me wrong other wise. I would turn bearish if 75.800 level breaks.

This is my last contribution to this thread.

Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Thanks for your input and trade well my friend!!

AUDJPY has opened below the 10 SMA on dailies today.

Is it a valid signal.  Should we enter short?

Would appreciate a view on this attached chart

indeed, it looks like a valid short.

Just got short the EURGBP off the daily chart,  cross of 10sma, trendline break.  Stop above the resistance @ .8450

--- 帖子 #264 ---
That is not my favorite pair to trade but I see your point on entry. Good luck!!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
personally I would be looking for a long position here....too near support area,just my opinion

Went short eur/jpy this morning.Cross below 10sma and definetly in a downtrend. S/L is already locked in +5

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi BKG, which is the initial SL you usually use when you enter a trade bejore moving it to BE? Do you use LR/LS like a reference or is just defined by your Money Management?

I hope you understand my question, English is not my native language...

Thanks.

Greg.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
It is smart to put an initial s/l of 200 pips just in case something crazy happens while we are sleeping. I mostly use previous support and resistance areas as my s/l location.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
from the chart you meant you short one day earlier? you are profiting by a (yesterday) candle?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
It is a valid short imho

Been watching this strategy for a while and used it on demo with some success.

Finally took the plunge today.  Short at 1.3102

Hi bkg102665,

I am a newbie and following your thread with great interest. In your previous postings you mentioned that the initial SL is either to be set at 200 pips, or as you do most, to place it in the previous S/R areas. However, it seems that you had changed the SL to +5 before it got hit. What is the reason/rational behind such move? I am a learner, so your answer would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers!...

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Good question! I will always move my s/l to +5 once I am up in a trade somewhere between 60 and 100 pips. As a young trader my advise would be to never let a winning trade turn into a loser. Once you are up you need to look at moving your s/l to atleast +1 or more so the trade does not turn into a loser as I said before. Once you lock your s/l in positive pips the trade becomes stress free and there is no way you can loose. You can walk away and know it is a winning trade. It allows you to concentrate on your next possible trade setup.

Are you implying to use 60-100 pips trailing SL? I pose this question to you because for newbie the correct placement of SL is a real challenge.

Thanks in advance for your reply... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #279 ---
No I never use a trailing stop. When you put you s/l to a positive +1 or +5 let it run to the next area of support or resistance. These trades will very often get you 300, 500, sometimes even 1000 pips but it may take a week even up to a month to get there,

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I am not doubting your thought process but I rarely look at anything other than a daily chart. It is just the way I trade. I made 5 pips so I am happy and I will move to next trade. We all trade different so if weekly charts help you I encourage you to use them.

Hi BKG,

I downloaded your email alert. But I can't seem to get it working.

Im using "smtp.gmail.com" as my server.

When I do a test message, I keep getting these 2 errors:

"2012.02.02 15:54:49Mail: 'Test message' failed"

"2012.02.02 15:54:49Mail: 530 5.7.0 Must issue a STARTTLS command first. r9sm3990739pbi.6"

Appreciate your advise on this. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
hi, sory i dont really get it the term s/l to a positive +1 or +5. What are they mean? Does it mean trailing stop 15points or 55points?

Thx for the great system.

Thx in advance.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
BKG/Bellamy if I may.

What BKG means is that on opening a trade he may put a Stop Loss (S/L) of 100 to 200 pips intially. Then once the trade is in  profit by 60 to 100 pips he moves his stop loss from its original position to +5 pips above his entry level.

That way he has locked in 5 pips profit. He does not move his stop again.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I could not have said it better........obviously I did not say it that good lol

--- 帖子 #285 ---
BKG, I have another question. Once you entered the trade, you put the -100/200 pips SL to cover any unexpected movement. But in the case that the entry wasn't so good and prices move against you in a normal way, do you close the operation immediately or wait for the -100/200 pips SL to be beaten?

Thank you very much, I appreciate your advice.

Greg.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
It all depends on where my support resistance areas are. If it moves against me but does not close above are below my s/r area I let it ride. Once s/r ares is broken by a closed candle (not a candle that is still running) I will get out of the trade.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Here is an example of a trade I entered 2 days ago on eur/nzd. Price closed below 10sma so I entered short at 1.58489. I am now up 120 pips so I just moved my s/l to +5 which is 1.58439. The white line is entry and the red line is s/l. Now this is a winning trade no matter what happens so it takes all the emotion out and I can relax and look for another trade now.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
BKG thank you very much. I give 5 stars to this thread!!!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I do the best i can when time allows

--- 帖子 #294 ---
hi bkg

protect the position it as we see signs of reversal or where they spent a couple of days is a great idea ... because with this strategy appear very early opportunities

I think I will reduce my periods of time thanks to you

enter more times but remain less time

thanks

--- 帖子 #295 ---
hi, thx for sharing this successfull method, i prefer to sell half position after 100 pips, and set the rest for BE +10, so its comfortable for me, only an idea

cheers

--- 帖子 #296 ---
That idea works well also. We must all tweek this system to your method of trading. Thanks for your input.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi bkg102665,

http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif Are you implying that the placement of 100/200 pips initial SL shouldn't go beyond the S/R area, where SMA10 moves up and down. In other words, for a short entry the "highest" possible initial SL would be the Resistance line. And, for a long the "lowest" possible SL would be the Support Line. Am I correct in my interpretation? If it doesn't cause you too much trouble, would you be able to include a picture to clarify this issue.

http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif Another question, do you listen/read the market news as one of the criteria in making decision where to place the initial SL? For example EUR/JPY, few days ago there was a rumor that BOJ might intervene, hence a big chance that EUR/JPY might change the direction, which was the case though BOJ hadn't done so. It was just a mere rumor, but your +5 SL was hit.

http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Please bear with me for I am a learner and your method here is very promising indeed. Therefore, I am following it closely.

Looking forward to having your reply. Thanks a lot for your help!

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
hi, i put my sl always +10 pips of my entry candle, but i also monitor my trades if i can, and if you are scared about news than you never be able to go in a trade because something happen can every time in the world so don`t think about too much what it could happen

i hope you understand what i mean my english is not so perfect

cheers

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi frani60,

Please tell me how do you place a +10 pips SL ahead of an entry unless the price has already moved more than 10 pips? What worries me is where to place the "initial" SL as soon as an entry is made, because as a newbie I have problem with placing the initial SL. Beside this, how would you monitor a trade with daily time frame? How often do you check your trade within 24 hours?

Looking forward to having your reply. Thanks!

Cheers...

--- 帖子 #300 ---
here the picture i hope it is clearer, long candle put the sl -10 pips at the low and short +10 pips at the high of the candle

i monitor the trade at my i-phone with an app, and also i have always a small netbook with me, because i trade @ 2 different accounts one with mt4 and one on rbs (oanda) it is useful for the iphone

i look at the charts on different times most at london an new york opens and if there are some important news like forexfactory calendar also on the iphone

so i hope i could help if more questions than tell me

cheers

--- 帖子 #301 ---
sorry, but i don`t want to make an advertisement for iphone, but i only want to say how i manage a trade if you want to know the apps than write me an pn, this apps are for free

cheers

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thanks, frani60. So, in the picture you effectively place the initial SL  108 pips (= 1.2743-1.2635) below your long entry. Please correct me if I  am wrong. Also, thanks for the offer of iphone free apps. I don't have it yet, have to earn the money from trading to buy it.

Any comment from bkg102665?...

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
yes it`s the lowest low of the entry candle because it is a long candle, if it is a short candle than 10 pips above the highest high of the entry candly, so if it is a smaller candle than are les pips

okay

--- 帖子 #304 ---
His explanation is dead on!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
what do you mean???

--- 帖子 #306 ---
It was a very good explanation my friend.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Wow!... Now I fully understand  where to place the initial SL and am confident to apply this method in a real trade.

You both are so valuable in my endeavor to learn fx trade. Thank you so much!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
ahhh thanks

i think everyone must find his style from trading and how it is comfortable for himself, you gave us an very successfull strategy but trading must everyone aloe is my opinion, but if we can help than we should do this i think

i traded your method also on smaller tf`s it works too, but this is for another place to talk for

greets

--- 帖子 #309 ---
fine if you understand

--- 帖子 #310 ---
One more question friend. If you don't mind, please tell me what is your winning rate using this method?

Many thanks again in advance... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/editor/smilie.gif

--- 帖子 #311 ---
i only trade it since a short time, and also i trade only 3 to 4 pairs, and on daily you have not so much opportunities, but this trades i took until now, was winners but exactly pips i cannot say, i trade also an other strategy, so comes many trades on a day for me, i have no exact list about my trades, the account is for me important

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I will leave these positions ... waiting to enter in buy because they are very oversold

besides the price is far from the SMA 200 ... retracment's time, so the candles indicated by W and Mn

Two very nice trades!!

Good trading  -  I got into EURCAD about the same time.

Entry  1.31324

SL      1.32320

TP      1.30300

I am probably leaving too much on the table but I am also very new to trading the Daily Charts.  100 pips for me would be great.  We will see how it turns out.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Update:  I have moved my SL to BE +5 and my TP 1.2952 - That is still above

the Support level of 1.2875 but I may move it down as it approaches the present TP level.  Also why not add another order when I get into profit of +100?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi - just thought i would give you my latest trade. I do not know how to post charts but here are the details:

Entry:  .83047  Still pretty current

TP:      .82465

SL:      .84050

Really interested in some comments.  Want to learn this method.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Great job!! I often find when I get greedy it bites me in the butt. Just take it slow and get comfortable before you start doubling down would be my suggestion.

Just took some off at 100 pips  (EURCAD) and moved the rest to +10 to cover spread

update:  AudJpy trade hit target  @ 70 pips rest to +10 to cover spread

Have a good weekend all and thanks for everthing BKG

Just got short GBPAUD off the daily move off the 10sma & break below support, stop above resistance @ 1.5

Took 1/2 my normal position as it is a friday...

Moved the stop on my EURAUD position to b/e

My EURGBP is doing nothing, I'm gonna continue to let it work

Great system BKG!

Thanx for sharing nice system and goodluck.

I wll try to test it for some months on demo account. I like the simplicity of it which means less stress.

Audnzd looks interesting for next week if it closes above ma, what do you think guys? Maybe not the best risk to reward, but 1 to 1 we can reach.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi Bkg and fellow traders !

Nice thread and very good system....! I took AUDJPY as well. I entered two positions. One at the close of the bullish candle and one at the breach of the IB that followed with a very tight stop. Already sold half on that one at 1:1.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Second half stopped out at BE. First position stop locked at BE+5pips. I entered 2 new positions on EURCAD and EURAUD. Any comments is welcome....!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
EURAUD is near it's all time low (@ 1,2165). So that could be a very strong support...

--- 帖子 #328 ---
there seems a valid short on the eu daily...

comments..

--- 帖子 #329 ---
The candle that made the all time low closed on friday below previous low of 1.2226 that is now supposed to be resistance. I entered on sunday opening that was below 1.2226. If it close back above it I will be out.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
There is strong support at 1.3025 connected to 10 or 11 days of consolidation. I personally will wait a day to see it close below this area before entering

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Bkg, I have a question for you. At what time do you enter at the operation? Is it at the close of the daily candle, or do you wait for the opening of London Session (or NY session...) to try to get a better entry price with less risk?

Thank you very much, and sorry for my poor English...

Greg.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Curious about the answer here aswell. I personally took the explanation of the system literally and I always look at the close price of the previous candle to determine what to do. After that I set a good price limit order to possibly shave a couple of pips off the price or just forget about the trade if it keeps going up. This seems counterintuïtive since I would be missing out on strong movements, but what can I say? I'm a sucker for bargains...

--- 帖子 #333 ---
EURAUD closed at BE. EURCAD for a loss close to SL. AUDJPY still running at +120pips.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I will enter at the open of the daily candle.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hello Bkg102665

Great system. Current AUDJPY up 200+, want it to go through 84, target 86.

New trades, EURUSD, target first resistance, then 200 sma (green line).

EURJP, GBPJP to target resistance on chart.

Thanks again for the great system and posts.

bkg

if u dont mind, are fxdd and ibfx from United States?

tq

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hopefully BKG won't mind me answering.  Yes they are both from the US, but I believe they have affiliates outside the US.  Ibfx for example has one that i Know of which is IBFX Australia.  FXDD has a 5 pm est closing Candle and IBFX has a 7 or 8 PM EST closing candle depending on Daylight Savings in the US. (7pm EST now until we move our clocks up 1 hour on 3/25/12 )

BKG, thank you very much for answering my question.

Each broker will have different day. For instance I am Chicago CST and my email alerts for daily cross up/cross down is 18:00, 6:00 pm my time. So I wait. Do you suggest I not wait and enter on alert if all other conditions are favorable like support resistance, etc?

nf is not dare to commit his trades in the daily commentaries with his trading method. many were found "after the facts / events" comments. but overall nf trading method is good especially his many trading guides.

bkg is much simpler: ma10 at SL (buy) vs RL (sell). trade commitment is there (with proper RR & MM). very good indeed

Hi Guys,

Made a trade yesterday with the close of the GBPUSD daily.

Reasoning:

- Bounce off resistance at around 1.59276

- Resistance and bounce off the 200 sma

- Shorting below the 200 sma

- Closure below the 10 sma

- Next support level approx 1.54410

currently:

- price is moving towards support.

- have moved the SL to +8.3 (covering spread)

screenshot attached.

anyone else on this one?

Based on bkg rules, after the breakout of 10sma on the closed of day, wait for retrace.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Sometimes I am not certain that BKG's rules are being followed as he stated. Most folk refer to the cross of the sma but few refer to support.

BKG said  - take longs when price is at support and then closes above the 10smatake shorts when price is at resistance level and then closes below the 10sma

Hope this helps

heath it certainly helps it is easy to forget the rules when other posters just dont seem to be following them .

Hello All

This is my first post on this system and now following the system rule I enter short on EUR/USD @ 1.3137. My problem is how to put the SL. Now I put 100pips away from my enter price. Is ok?

Thanks

Best Regards

Danutz

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Heath, I've noticed that as well.

I've focused my trades on only using the correct conditions. As soon as you start changing the entry signals, the strategy will be impacted and could become non-profitable and/or false signals.

Unfortunately I was bitten with my GU trade on the retracement, hit my stop loss in positive territory however

Looking for the next signal, GU has moved lower, so good luck to whomever jumped on it!

Hey Guys,

Thanks for the great system. Am still yet to take a loss on both live and demo. Following original rules strictly plus a few of my own.

Just wondering how everyone is calculating their position size. Are lot sizes calculated based of the,

A) 200pip S/L

B) Nearest S or R

C) Comfortable lot size*

*Comfortable lot size can be anything not 'technically' calculated, which is possible if your able to cut losses short and highly beneficial if your winners run.

Mine is C) currently.

Hi all, I am still trying my best to learn. So would appreciate all inputs.

Most off at Profit Target ,now just managing the trade.  Hindsight on this trade would be to check the angle of the 10sma at entry.  It was flat where I entered (Marked on the chart),and if I had waited it would have given me another chance.  Just thinking out load Hope you all dont mind

Jay what stop did you set in this trade and of which candle.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
My Stop was approx. 175 pips at the black line (Resistance area at around 1.5890)  Mainly because of all the wicking of the candles prior to the entry candle  i had marked 2.9.12.( this in reference to the GBPCAD trade above)

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I am really glad to see you guys getting this and finding it helpful. I entered short eur/cad lastnight and up +60 so I have locked s/l at +5.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I am also short gbp/usd and up +60 or so but I have not locked in profit yet. We may see some resistance in this area so I will allow this trade to breathe a little before locking s/l at +5.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
hi bkg

good trades taken!

how soon you BE a trade?

upon daily closed?

or some # pips in profits?

how about in reverse when a trade goes into red?

cheers

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I lock in s/l +5 usually when I am up around 100 pips but sometimes soon and sometimes later. It depends alot on price action and my gut feeling on the trade. If price reverses and closes on the opposite side of the 10sma is a good time to get out but here again it depends on s/r areas. SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE AREAS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN MAKING THIS TRADING STYLE WORK!!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hy BIMM!! I have taken the same trade in the AUDUSD.

The reasons for the entry were as follows:

- Break of a resistance and creation of a new resistance (new high on the previous swing)

- Close below the SMA 10 with a strong candle (this is very important because we need a candle showing the market decision)

- Break the TL (dotted line)

Targets:

- Initial SL = new resistance (170 pips or so)

- TP 1 = TL (gray line) => close half of the short position and leave the other half with SL = BE

- TP 2 = line Support => close the second half of the position, or hold it if the candle closes below the support

Now, prices have not yet fulfilled the first objective, and we have some PA around the entry level. I will wait at the end of the day, and if the candle closes above the SMA 10 we have 2 options:

a) Close the short position and enter long with TP 1 = new resistance

b) Hold the short position until it stops at Initial SL

This is my way of operating. Hope this helps.

Greg.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yep exact same trade here. It's being very indecisive but I am confident that if this candle closed below 10SMA we will be correct. Otherwise if it closes above I will consider closing the trade. Time will tell  (6hrs to be exact)

You guys that are proficient in your trading it would be helpful to us that are not so switched on if you could post up your trades immediately after you have taken them.

Entry stop-loss and take profit is all that would be required to enable us to check out the right criteria.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
In about 6hrs I will post a couple. But the extreme simplicity of this system should pretty much explain itself. The only 'issue' people may have is with the placing of S&R which is totally a trader issue no matter how much explanation you receive, you just need to practice. Open a DEMO and just trade, almost the best way to learn apart from real $.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Thanks Rokz just not to sure about the stop losses which candle to take them from if the previous candle is smaller than the trigger candle.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Man honestly mine are just in between 100 and 200 pips. That's just backup in case the world blew up. You should be out before price got near that. Daily candles aren't going anywhere any time soon management of these trades is incredibly simple, just check out your trade when ya can.

- 100-200pip S/L

- Check on trade when ya can. (Especially close of day)

- Take off 50% at 60pips move S/L to Breakeven+5 or whatever floats ya boat.

I only take trades in the direction of the 200SMA. So I will let them go till that sucker says otherwise.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
The SL is not defined by a candle. It is defined as a dynamic area of protection where you are willing to close the trade if things doesn't go as planned. Those areas where you expect the price to bounce are good to define the SL (eg, Res / Sup lines, TL, Fibos, etc ...). In this strategy we can place the initial SL above the Res / Sup line, and once reached the first goal (which can be defined graphically or by your money management) you must move SL to BE.

Another way of doing things is NOT to use SL, and reverse the position when the price closes above / below the 10 SMA.

Also, we can use a combination of the 2 methods, and decide which to use as the operation evolves.

As Roky said, the SL method is a personal decision that depends on the style and level of risk you are willing to accept.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
The only thing I would add is with your 100-200 pip SL placement, make sure it is at a real support or resistance point in the market + or - 5 or 6 pips, not just a 100 pip SL thrown on the chart and dare the market to come get you because it will.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Exactly what do you mean by direction of the 200 sma.

I have a sell trade on at the moment the 200sma is below it is that what you mean by direction.

I entered on a pullback on the aud/cad at 1.0702 roughly where the trigger candle crossed the 10sma, stop loss 1.0748 and take profit at 1.0661.

Risk reward is 1/1 or should I increase this and hope for the best.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Here is an example.

USDCAD :

- Price closed ABOVE the 10SMA(Yellow Line) previous candle.

- 200SMA(White Line) is on a UPWARD slope (Looking for BUYS)

- Previous Bar is a pretty sexy pinbar.

- SUPPORT is at 0.99200, nice place for S/L. Tight 80pips. (Zoom out and place a line there, price has REACTED here previously)

- My first TP will be 1.00800 (I will close out 50% of my position, Price has REACTED here previously)

-Move my S/L to BE when TP1 is hit, remainder left to run. Although may take it all of on the dotted white line(Yearly Pivot Point).

Also by some freak timing, my order was placed EXACTLY on 1.00000. lol

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I won't 'hope' for pull backs, I would rather get in on a good position in the direction of the bigger trend.

SMA200 heading upwards. More inclined to BUY.

SMA200 heading downwards. More inclined to SELL.

SMA200 Flat. Zoom out to Weekly. Still Flat? Move on, wait for something to develop.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I was eyeballing this trade earlier, and based on the 10ma & s/r it looks like a great set up.  I'm not so convinced that the risk rally is over, so am just gonna watch this one.

Good luck on the position.

Jon

--- 帖子 #409 ---
hope pb shown on many usd majors would work nicely to south

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Rokz I have set an order on the retracement of the pin-bar entry 0.9979 where the 10 sma crossed on my UK midnight close chart but the 200 sma is above my entry sloping up and above the pin-bar.

Yours is below and also sloping up.

My stop loss is 5 pips below the lowest support bar at 0.9921 (58stop)

It will be interesting to watch as we are trading of different time close charts.

Maybe we can learn something new from it unfolding.

It is 10 minutes to midnight now so I will post this reply.

The best of luck in your trade.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Please explain your reasoning.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
just my 2 cents...

i long ucad after the pull back as yesterday pb shown up and crossed back/up into sma10. (similar to uchf 3 days ago - i didn't long)

i short gusd (i wish i would have short it 3-4 days ago) after yesterday (a 3rd) pb crossed down RL. this pair is showing a very rare PA pattern i.e. bear candle then pb for the last 6 days. well hope it would go south further? let see

thanks to bkg offering a simple n easy trading method.

p.s. pls. ignore the bands.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Are you seeing how this works now don55? Our USDCAD is in positive, you will need to maintain it over the next few days or weeks. Once it hits a comfortable level for you, take off 50% to bank some profit then let it run.

Don't be scared if it goes negative for a bit, I've had an AUDUSD open for two days that's having trouble staying positive, but I will stick with it until the strategy says otherwise.

On Tuesday I had no trades in my log. I stuck with this strat only to see the power of it and currently floating 300pips, only one trade negative and three at breakeven. Six all up.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Olu in the UK yes but  whose to say it might be different in another part of the world.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Yep getting the picture now and feeling very positive.

Meant to say still waiting for the pullback but if it does not no big deal that is my strategy especially with pin-bars.

Rokz this is what I meant by interesting last night, yesterdays buy has now turned into a sell as it bounced of the 200 ma in the uk close chart.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi All,

I am very new to this thread.

Was going through the thread and very much interested in learning this method.

I have a Eur/Usd chart here.

Looks like a sell signal for me.

Can any one teach me if its not.

Here are the details.

Candle closed below 10sma. (Red).

Price below 200Sma.

Price is close to resistance.

Is this valid Sell signal.

Thanks.

KC.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi KCV,

The EURUSD trade is not a valid entry signal at this point.

When a candle closes above or below the sma10, your entry must be on the close of the candle or on a pullback. The EURUSD is currently 4 candles since the cross occurred.

Secondly you have drawn the next support level at approx 1.2632, however you have not taken into consideration another major support level at around 1.2972 - 1.2940, in which you can see that it has bounced off.

I would wait until EURUSD finds the next support/resistance level and then bounces through the next sma10.

I've attached a screenshot where you can see the other support lines.

Best of luck,

Miike

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi Miike,

First I want to thank you for your fast reply.

I took your advice and went back to the chart.

I enlarged the chart and now I can see clearly what you are talking about.

Yes, I got to remember that I am dealing with a daily chart here. Four candles makes a lot of difference.

I understood now.

S/r - I was using the Expert adviser from BKG.

It put those s/r lines. I went back to the page where he posted and read the description again.

He clearly mention that we can change the lines to where ever we want.

So instead of counting on the expert I re-draw the s/r lines.

I am having little bit trouble drwaing these s/r. Going to practice with other pairs.

Here is the chart.

Thanks for all your help.

KC.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Very good explanation Miike. I could not have come up with a bettere answer for his question myself. I would add that we must take the trade at the close of the candle that crosses the 10sma or maybe on the next candle if we get pullback but waiting four candles later normally will not be a valid trade unless you have a candle pattern that suggest otherwise. Yesterdays eur/usd candle suggest further movement up to me so I would not take this trade.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Thanks BKG.

nice weekend

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Looks like you may be using a10 period  EMA vs SMA.  I put a 10EMA on the chart I posted above and it did have a close above.  Thats why you are probably getting a different signal.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
A cursory preliminary review has resulted in creation of the following short list  :

GBPAUD  -  Long  -  almost ready

GBPNZD  -  Long  -  almost ready

EURUSD  -  Long  -  watch

EURAUD  -  Long  -  watch

EURNZD  -  Long  -  watch

USDSGD  -  Short  -  watch

NZDCHF  -  Short  -  watch

Will re-review this short list upon opening of the market (Sunday at 06.00PM EST  -  at my Broker) and once again at Close of the Sunday Daily Candle (Sunday at 07.00PM EST or Midnight GMT) and finalize the potential trade entries.

Requesting all experienced Traders to please scrutinize and offer guidance.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
minortrader  if you dont mind an explanation of your list and how you have come to it would be helpful

--- 帖子 #442 ---
yes jay you are right, but i had good results until now

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Just follow the system and you wont go wrong, any other MAs are not recommended apart from a sma10 it could not be any more simpler.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Totally disagree we are all here to hopefully get on board with a proven system which I believe this one is if we are not happy following it well what can I say ?

Jay we all have our opinions whether they be right or wrong but we can all learn from each other.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
minortrader,

Looks like a nasty open on the GA and GNZ trades.

Considerable movement back under the 10SMA.

Miike

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I thought this system was all about entering trades on the close of the day whether they be above or below the 10sma

--- 帖子 #447 ---
-----------------------------------------------------

Hi Don,

Sorry for delay in response.    Having some Broker Site issues.

I just follow BKG's System, without any amendment, addition or change.

Scanned each and every pair available on my Broker's Platform (IBFX)  and made a short list of the pairs which appeared to be in the process of reversal from either the Resistance or Support.

Ones which have already just reversed and closed above (or below) the 10sma are prime candidates for Trade entry upon further confirmation at the time of closing of Sunday Daily Candle in about 15 minutes from now (07.00PM EST / midnight GMT).

No trade is taken yet.

Just waiting for current daily candle to close.

Hope this answers your question.

But, please feel free to ask any further clarifications or offer your valuable comments.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi Don555,

I've had another look at the charts.

GA is currently in a downtrend channel. The current daily has crossed the 10SMA but we are awaiting close.

GZ is currently trending down, has crossed the 10SMA and is heading to the next support at around 1.85800. This is a valid trade if we can enter at the close of the signal bar at 1.89875.

Screenshots attached.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi minortrader will you put up what you think are okay trades to enter. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
------------------------------------------------------

Hi Mike,

You are right.

Fortunately, I have not entered any trade yet.

Because of the uncertainty of the market movement during the prolonged recess over the weekends, I prefer to defer new Trades (which may be generated at the closing of Market on Friday evening) to be taken only after the closing of daily candle on Sunday.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I normally do not but there is no harm in knowing where those areas are.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Personally I think not. This has been a s/r area so I would probably look at another pair or short this if we get that signal.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Don,

IMHO, strictly on technical basis, there is only one trade today, which is to Buy EURUSD.

But, I won't take it.

Too much dark cloud hanging around this pair due to uncertainty about Greece Debt arrangement / agreement.

Secondly, this pair is in an overall downtrend.

So, would rather wait for a valid Short signal.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thanks for your advice I will certainly take it.

bkg in post 94 what did you mean by a candle closing full

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hy all!! One of you asked me to post the charts of the trades I've taken with this simple method, as I've shared my results last week with you.

This is a brief report of all the trades I've done with BKG method, and I hope it helps those who are interested in learning this way of trading.

I have taken 6 trades (demo) and I have this results:

GBPUSD => + 100 pips

AUDUSD => Still open

EURUSD => + 150 pips

USDCHF => + 70 pips

EURCAD => + 70 pips

EURGBP => + 45 pips

I closed 5 trades for + 435 pips. It's amazing!!!

(I know that I've told you I made 485 pips... well, I've made 50 more pips trading the same method in a Long for NZDUSD in a 4h chart. Please don't ask me to post this trade because it is out of this thread!!)

BKG, I notice that all winning 1/2 positions that I've set SL at BE have been closed. Once I close the first 1/2 position at the TP target, I'm thinking that perhaps it is convenient to close the remaining 1/2 position if price comes against the trade and falls / reaches the 50% of the target. (It is difficult to me to explain it in english, so tell me if it's not clear). What do you think about this? How do you manage your trade in this situations?

Greg.

Here are the charts:

--- 帖子 #458 ---
gregofx -

It appears that the 3d candle after entry is a heads up in this market.  Maybe I'm not seeing correctly or generalizing too much but hitting BE seems to have ocurred during the 3d candle on your charts.  And maybe this is all we can expect in this crazy Greece will Greece won't time period.

Congratulations for some good trades.  p.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi guys it is my first post and I wish to say this is the best strategy I have ever seen. Since friday I am up about 200 pips these are my trades from friday:

EUR/USD Buy 1.3156 SL 1.3136 TP open

USD/CAD Sell 0.9967 SL 0.9990 TP open

USD/JPY  Buy 79.34  SL 78.90 TP open

EUR/JPY  Buy 104.52 SL 104.00 TP open

All positive and still running

God bless You BKG

Thank You so much for this simple and amazing strategy

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hi Gregfx,

I saw your trades and I took the same trades as you.

one point with the stoploss .

When I enter a  long signal I put my stoploss a few pips below the low of  the entry candle. you took the last swing high.

in the trade of the  EUR/USD it is a differnce of 40 pips.

Look back in your trades and see that when you put your stoploss at the high of low of the signalcandle you can make more pips and your risk reward is going up.

HI BKG,

I finished reading this thread and was doing backtest on few currency pairs.

I remember you mentioned that when the price turns back and finishes below 10sma (on a buy trade) you close the trade.

Am I correct.

If yes. What you will do in the following example.

Got a buy signal. (Price closed at above 10sma and above the support line).

Got in the buy trade.

Now very next candle it close just below the 10sma.

Questions

1. Will you close the trade?

2. Given that the stop is not hit and its just went below 10sma, will you hold the trade for one more candle.

I have attached 2 examples here.

Thanks in advance.

KC.

Gregofx,

Very well executed trades there, well done!

Perhaps it would be a good idea that we all share our analysis of any potential or actual trades.

Giving reasoning before and during a trade is always a better learning instrument than looking at a past trade. We can all benefit here!

Looking forward to the week ahead!

Good luck all!

Miike

--- 帖子 #466 ---
From what I can see on your charts you took a long trade that is just under resistance on both charts. Normally if price is just below resistance I am looking for short signals. If price is just above support then I am looking for a long signal.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Thanks and when you get enough send one my way!!

--- 帖子 #468 ---
My candles do not close until anothe 30 min. I will let you know what I see then my friend.

I seem to be getting a sell here. Do we all see this?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Thanks bkg I thought candles on your charts closed at 10pm uk time, I will stay up and see if there are any trades.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hi bkg...

Basically what you're saying is: Short, when the signal/previous candle close is below the resistance level and below SMA10. (Note: The opposite is true for long).

Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks in advance... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #472 ---
It looks like a valid trade to me. Close to resistance and below the 10sma. It meets my criteria for a valid signal. My question to you is where will your s/l be?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Sorry about not getting back to you sooner. I just remembered I forgot to answer this question for you. Often when a candle closes full (no wick on the top when it is close to resistance and no wick on bottom if price is near support) price will reverse and run in the opposite direction. Just a little something I have learned from other traders over the years. My point here is if you are in a long and price gets close to resistance and the candle closes full with no upper wick GET OUT!!!

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Olu,

Good pickup, as BKG said, looks like a valid trade.

I've entered this trade as well.

Screenshot attached.

Reasoning for trade:

1. Resistance touched at 1.7047 region recently.

2. Close of candle crossing over the 10 SMA.

3. Closest support at 1.0607 region.

Good luck,

Miike

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Around 1.0748 the high of the reversal structure (candle)...

Olu

--- 帖子 #476 ---
That is where I would put mine but if I were able to look after the trade I would wait for a close above that to take it out. If I had to leave it I would put my s/l there no doubt. Maybe 1.0760

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Above the structure is better. But if risk comes back into the market I will not wait till the stop is hit.

Olu

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Olu if that happened where would you come out

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Don

I have a spread of 7 on my audcad pair on MT4. I will close this trade. The candle before this current candle has a high of 10723 so 10735 could get

me going for the exits...

Olu

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi Olu,

Here is some food for thought.

In terms of good money management, you should be exercising your contract / lot size based your requirements.

i.e. If your SL is 250 pips, to be in the correct SL position (1.07600), your size of you contract / lot should be appropriate for your risk of a financial value that is acceptable to be lost.

e.g. 2% Margin of account, max 50 USD loss, 250 pip SL, 50/250 = 0.20 USD per pip movement, 0.1 LOT entered.

Not saying that getting out of a bad position should be held until lost, but it is best to enter a trade with that in mind?

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #481 ---
You are right Mike and I do take this into consideration before entering trades. I do use position sizing. I must say though I do not wait for all my trades to hit stop loss all the time...

Olu

--- 帖子 #482 ---
HI Bkg,

I totally agree with your explanation for the S/R. Say there were no S/R at that chart. Then will you consider closing those trade.

Thanks.

KC.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #484 ---
For those of you that took this trade notice the shaded gray area to the left. This may stall price but if and when we break this area I have my support area with the blue line that may be a good t/p area.

I'm flat at the moment, nothing seen worth risking money on yet this week for me

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Yer, I have been really quiet. A couple trades went negative due to being at work while they spun around. Before work they looked great.

I'm currently working on a simple EA for myself to insert Stoploss, move Stoploss to Breakeven and Part Close my order without babysitting it. All the trade managers I find are too complex and have crap I don't want in their options.

Other than that there is a lot of potential for this strat, the reason there may not be so many comments is that people normally want something faced paced and full of signals. This is requires a lot of patience.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I have someone working on an ea that will put you in a trade when price closes across the 10sma. It will have an initial s/l of 200 (but can be changed to your choice). Once you are up 100 pips s/l will be moved to +5. If it enters you in a trade and the next candle reverses and closes on the other side of the 10sma it will take you out of the original trade and re-enter you in another trade.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Get him to add it the ability to change the Breakeven part, from the trades last week I found some struggled to get to 50pips after close let alone 100.

I know this because I wrote everything down in my journal and calculated why they hadn't worked.

One Example :

AU -   Sold @ 1.06859

Lowest Low (Following Candle) -   1.06450

Potential Maximum -   409points (40pips)

------------------------------------------

But with a 200pip Stoploss we would be still in this trade now and almost Breakeven. Only issue is that 200pip Stoploss seems rather large and I always try and cut losers instead of praying for a price flip. We can always re-enter, which AU is shaping up for tomorrow I believe.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
The only reason I have a s/l on it is if something happens in the world and price spikes. I suggest monitoring trades and cutting losses short when you can.

I will ask that we be able to change the break even as well. I know recently some have flipped on us but all in all 100 pips should be a good area to move s/l. We are working with daily candles and we have to give them room to breath. If we move the s/l to early you will get knocked out of trade at +5 almost always.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
bkg would the arrowed candle have qualified last night

--- 帖子 #493 ---
This would be great.  My D TF changes in the late afternoon, US/ct, and I never know if I should place a trade even if the signals are correct for the strategy as 4pm is the deadest action time.  This EA would be a big help.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
We did not get a signal for this pair from the indicator.

I did take this trade though because it was so close and price had bounced off of resistance. Mine make look a little different than yours because this trade was done on my FXDD account and the candles close 2 hours earlier than IBFX.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
It is QUIET in the forex market, BKG.  This is why, in my judgment, (and I am new to your DAY/10 SMA system):

1. EUR/USD is jammed aand consolidating at (D1) and not near 10 SMA

2. USD/CHF is jammed and consolidating at both D1 and W1 and pair is really not near 10 SMA

3. Perhaps a short with GBP/USD... waiting for possible close below10 SMA near R2

4. Oh my, the AUD/NZD is very tempting since it is enjoying such a nice bear trend (Hi, H4, D1, W1), but it is too late using the DAY CHART WITH 10 SMA system of trading.  I am two days too late.

5. The other pairs I look at are very uninteresting (USD/CAD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY,GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY,CAD/JPY, USD/JPY).

Please feel free to tell me where my analysis is correct or not.

Thank you.

Judy

--- 帖子 #496 ---
bkg my charts close at midnight I was thinking about taking this pair but I had already taken aud/cad and was not sure if you would recommend taking pairs that are correlated.

I take it now that you would am I right in thinking this.

An other way I have been trading this system is if I am near to 100pips positive I am taking the pips until I build up my confidence then I will go for more.

One last question for now do you trade gold & silver with this system.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Many pairs seem to be hovering around the cusp of tradeable levels but without offering clear, strong trade signals.

However, last night entered a short Trade in GBPCHF.

In addition am already in a short trade in AUDUSD since Feb 14th or 15th.

That trade is still (slightly) under water.

In future, will try to post the New Trades right away so as to obtain other Trader's comments, advice and guidance.

BKG, my sincere thanks to you for such a wonderful gift to all, including newbies like me who have been struggling for a long time.

Your gift of this simple workable system is very inspiring and re-kindles hope and courage for becoming a successful Trader in the very near future.

If you take pairs that are corelated you take a chance on being right in a big way or being WRONG in a big way. It just depends on your appetite for risk. I will take correlated pairs but sometimes it bites me in the ass!!

Taking profit is good, as a man once told me you can never go broke putting money in the bank! If you take yours at 100 pips that is fine.

I have never traded gold or silver so I am no help there, sorry.

i think some traders got bites/loss when went short on closed of Feb 10 candle (crossed down 10sma), unless they had a bigger stop loss than Feb 10 candle, otherwise it could be stopped out by Feb 20 candle.

Feb 20 candle closed as a small PB, and following by yesterday closed as a "fat" bear candle, might be the downtrend continue  i am in... let's see

cheers and happy pipping.

aud/usd is the only trade I see tonight I would take guys. If you guys see something post a chart and we will look at it. Most pairs I see tonight are moving sideways, stalled out I guess.

Hi BKG,

Good to see you being active today. AEST Austraila time here

One thing about the EA, it may be a good idea to look into some sort of check on the 200SMA when an entry signal is given.

I've got plenty of bad signals from 10SMA cross from resistance where it is against the 200 SMA trend which ends up continuing the trend and going against the signal. What you think?

Still in:

AUDCAD,

SELL: 1.06618

SL: 1.06578

TP: 1.05823

Current Price: 1.06217

Pending in:

AUDUSD,

Pending SELL: 1.06715

SL: 1.08715

TP: 1.04920

Current Price: 1.06455

BTW, I trade with IBFX as well.

Cheers,

Miike

I'm looking but waiting on the A/$ (200sma is very flat) and the gbp/$ (200sma is trendng down.)  Both would be sells but I am waiting to see how PA plays out for another hour or so.  The A/$ is coming down from a double top, just wish the trend was better.

Closed my AUDCAD trade.

I didn't like the look of how it was moving, could be potentially moving up to test resistance at 1.0665 area.

SELL: 1.06618

BUY: 1.06387

Profit: +23.1 pips

I liked the look of the EURNZD signal.

Cross occured after pushing up from support at around 1.5664, with resistance at 1.5958.

BUY: 1.5870

Current: 1.5881

SL: 1.5836

TP: 1.5920

Screenshot attached.

Cheers,

The AUDCAD pair has good resistance at 1.06320, it cant seem to break that barrier. I still see some downside movement in that pair.

The EUR/NZD also has very strong resistance 1.5899, i would hold off on this trade until it breakes that level.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Thanks Fara13,

AUDCAD, closed this position as per my comments, I didn't like the movement when I was monitoring this. I prefer to close out a winning position, take the profit and move on, than turn a good profit into a loss. There is always the risk of pulling out too early on this one.

EURNZD, thanks for your view on this. I've been monitoring the SM200 on this at the 4H to close out below. On the daily it does show a selling trend. I've moved my stop on this to 1.5879, with TP at 1.5899.

Don555,

Yes, you are correct, however I decided to ignore that rule for this trade due to the bounce off the support and push towards the 200SMA on the 4H, I also had a low risk on this trade.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I am not trying to be critical here guys but we are starting to add a bunch of things for a trade to be considered "a good trade". Everybody needs to make this fit their personality but if you start adding to many rules you will never get in a trade......just saying. Please show me the pairs that you have had trouble with in the past, show me a chart, and lets figure out why it did not work. There is not a system anywhere in the world that never gives a wrong signal (no matter how much you pay for it).

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Very true BKG,

it's not about the perfect trade, it's about getting a trade, limiting any potential loss and ending it in profit.

I'm still in the AUDUSD, which is doing nicely at the moment, heading down...

Also in GBPNZD, in the red at the moment, but it's close to BE, the high of the current candle is adhering to the descending triangle resistance, so looks like it is going to test the support at 1.8682

Time will tell, hows everyone else doing?

Cheers,

Miike

Hi Olu, I saw it last night but to many problems for me.  To close to a support level and right on the RN 9700.  I will look at it again tonight  after candle close to see if it made it past the problem areas, and see if it makes sense to enter.  I like to see at least 100 pips of clear room before entering a trade.  Just my personal preference

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I have profit locked in on my aud/usd trade and we will see where she goes.....looking pretty good right now.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Now this I agree with. If you are in a high traffic area better to sit and see what happens. There are enough pairs to trade that we need to look for the right trade. Always look to the left on your chart and if you see consolidation in this area wait until it clears that area before taking the trade. Patience is key here.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Awesome day for GU, closed out half and moved stop to BE +5.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Just my 2 cents

This pair is difficult to trade since Jan 17 it is in ranging...

We have...

2 candles attempts crossed up 10sma

+ 5 candles attempts crossed down 10sma

+ 4 pb down

i see the 5th time candle crossed down 10sma after the 4th pb... looking +ve, especially once the SL is broken... foresee a downtrend prevails for the near term...

well in the live trading, there is no straight line answer  let's see

p.s. i am not in the trade since I already have oz/usd.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
congrat, rok.

i wish yesterday candle crossed 10sma after the pb down... that's why i short oz/usd instead

the one on Feb 10 was good but i got be

hope it will go beyond 1.5645

interesting... u closed half in a winning trade... do you close half in a losing trade?

cheers

I shorted this pr last night @ 1.0622 and it stayed in negative pips for 12 hours.  This morning when it briefly went positive I got out a +3.  I don't think I will trade any more this week: 2 winners for +33pips, 3 losers for -62 pips for a net -29.  The Greek solution isn't much of one according to the markets.

THANKS BK for this system ......i am retired and in my 70's. have been trading for 8 yrs.

trying now to supplement our savings but like to play golf and fish.

I am sick of 1hr charts so this will fit my trading style.

I too trade with IBFX. and have been with them for 8 yrs.I feel like my money is safe and i love their Debit card service.

i use their partal close EA to manage my trades. i have downloaded the alert and support.. works fine still working on email

I have read everyones posting and want to thank all for the help for this old man. thanks again BK>more later .........DON

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Glad to have you on board....

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Well yes it was really close. But I woke to my alarm in the morning to check the daily candle close I had two emails on my phone from the 10SMA email alert for both GU and AU.

I close out half my position at a certain level and leave the remainder to run with the stop now at breakeven. If it runs 'Woohoo' if it doesn't oh well. I think that's a major part of the way I picture trading this way, catching massive moves. Especially on Daily timeframes.

I'll always take something off the table, even though it's small it adds up and will compound your positive trades for when you hit the big runners.

With losing trades, I fully close them out once price has closed on the opposite side of the 10SMA. No reason to keep them open, open one the other way if you feel it may work for you. There is always an opportunity somewhere.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Well bkg you are absolutely right here Mike went into a buy trade this morning for the eur/nzd and got at least 50 pips.

I stayed out of it because of the slope down of the 200sma it has now gone 140 pips +

The question is when should I take the 200sma in to consideration.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Guys I finished my personal trade manager tonight. Working a day job made locking in profits with this system sometimes difficult.

Here it is to share, let me know what you think. It does not need to be run on every chart so save your ram and only attach it to one.

-------------

Updated Manual :

Most trade managers I found were super complex and confusing to use. This was created to make life and trading a lot easier. This EA does not need to be run on multiple charts, so long as your trade comment matches your input it will be under control. It supports both 4 and 5 digit brokers, and also the 2 and 3 digit JPY pairs.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
don555 hindsight will kill your trading abilities, there is always something around the corner. Don't look back and dream of pips, look forward and concentrate on earning pips.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi BKG, will you short the GBPUSD if it close below the 10 SMA like the chart shows? Is this a good setup? I'm not sure of this one because it will close too near the Support Line.

What do you think, guys?

Thanx

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hey folks, I'm not complaining about a not-so-hot week.  I started the 1st of Feb. being down 10.3% in my live account but with this strategy and also Hugh Briss' I'm only down 4.2% so I am happy

And to "lotapips" - if I get to the Ides of March (3/15) I'll be 74 so here's to old but scrappy seniors!!

I still haven't quite figured out how to enter a D. trade when the new candle starts at 16:00 central timet, not much happening then.  I'm thinking that I should look in around 10-10:30pm to see if there is a good setup.  Any help with this is much appreciated.  Good trading all, p.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
For me its an easy pass. There is a lot of Support for the GBPUSD to chop thru in the consolidation area to the Left (Blue) .  Im not saying that the GBP will not fall thru the floor tonight and make 500 pips, but for the "Risk management" part of my money management,   I will pass trading into consolidation every time.  Because there will always be another trade.  Just my opinion Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Yes... I agree with that point. I dont like that consolidation area, but there is one thing that makes me doubt. If you look at the EURGBP and the GBPCHF, you can see that the prices have been in a consolidation area, but today they have broken this area and they seem that they have started a new swing.

I think if the setup was an A+ Setup, I would not doubt to trade it. That's why I better let it go... :nerd:

Thanx for your answer!!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Ok, for the EA make the TradeComment whatever you would like. Then every time you open a trade there is a Combo Box called 'Comment:' type the same thing in there. This is how it chooses which trades to take care of.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
my 2 cents...

it is a 50:50 ratio to win or lose on a trade (even with or without a trading method)...

so i am always calculating the possible higher winning trade % (who doesnt want to win most times)...

once i am in a trade i forget and set it until it hits my TP or SL or unless a PA shows up signaling me my winning % is dimming and then i would forgo and exit it manually (i could be making a wrong decision on this but it is a live trading, only god knows... he he he)...

e.g. gold was an example (be when pb up showed on feb 16) and gbp (be when a bull engulfing candle popep up on feb 16) are the recent cases. hope not on the current oz trade

for gbp... i would go for short since the overall context favoring downtrend especially the 2nd retracement from 200ma (i seldom use it... just to keep my chart clean... anyway i am not good at 200ma)... potentially going down to 1.5330

chow... back to work... happy pipping

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks mate for the trade management EA.

Couple of questions, if I may. Is it a stealth type where the variables are not shown on charts/trade columns but instead runs in background? If so, puter needs to be running to get the job done. Secondly, does it override tp/sl already set prior to running yours? Finally, does it disappear (removed automatically) as the trade is closed? I ran it on a few charts and this is what I discovered so far.

Cheers,

Akira

--- 帖子 #547 ---
snyper..i live on the Texas Gulf coast. my broker closes dat at 6:00 pm

Thank ROKZ for the answer

--- 帖子 #548 ---
It only needs to be on one chart and it will manage everything with your chosen trade comment. No it's not stealthy it places your set stoploss and takeprofit, but only if it's currently NOT SET. Therefore just open a "New Order" set your "Comment:" and click "Buy" or "Sell". When a trade is closed it is closed, even if you close it yourself it will not matter. It's very basic and forgiving.

It simply cycles the open orders checking for missing stoplosses, takeprofits and if the trade parameters are met for triggering breakeven and part close.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
usdcad ..........any one looking at this one

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Thanks Rokz.

I removed the default comment "rokz" and now see it manages all trades with no comments. For those orders partially closed that have comments are not managed since the mismatch of comments. Used with care, your EA is very helpful, indeed.

Thanks again,

Akria

--- 帖子 #551 ---
my thought but 1.0030 i see a big retrace

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Looking, will take a short if it crosses back below 10ma, recent consolidation, and breaks below Oct 28 swing low of  .9897

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Yep, that is correct. Once part of the order is closed it gains a new trade comment. The way the manager runs is to, Firstly set breakeven then do the Partial Close. So once it's not under management the trade no longer has a chance to lose money anyway. Glad you like it, if you notice any bugs let me know. I tested it thoroughly and use it myself, if I do change anything I will re-post it in this thread since I basically made it to assist me with this strategy.

Thats the whole point of the post.  I did have a valid signal to swing the bat(so to speak) at this trade.  But at what % of my account did I want to risk to enter this trade 1, 2,3 % of my account.  All trades are not equal from a risk management point of view.  Don't get in the habit of , I see a trade an automatically put  2% on a trade live or die.

Hey Don555,

I've been monitoring my current open positions:

1. GBPNZD:  SELL 1.8847, SL 1.9006, TP 1.8685, Current Price 1.8812, Pips +37

2. AUDUSD: SELL 1.0671, SL 1.0872, TP 1.0583, Current Price 1.0729 Pips -58

3. USDCAD: BUY 0.9995, SL 0.9950, TP 1.0012, Current Price 0.9975, Pips -25

Total: -46 Pips at the moment, but these are open positions.

Current Analysis,

1. GBPNZD - 1.8777, is the support it is currently going down to test, if broken, next support target will be 1.8580 area.

2. AUDUSD - Is sitting at around the 61.8% Fib retracement at 1.0732, this looks to be the resistance and is holding up at the moment. This should trend down from here if the trade is to be valid. I think I went to early on this and should have waited for the retracement to complete before entering. Lesson learned. Still holding.

3. USDCAD may have been a bad decision as it looks like it may trend further down, the daily however is currently moving upwards, so I will hang in on this one and monitor, if I see that it starts to sharply move down, I will cut my loss here, better to fight another day

I'm currently watching the GBPUSD pair, it's currently retracing from the break of the 10SMA. I'm looking at a SELL with an entry at around the 1.5762 (50% Fib) or 1.5790 (61.8% Fib).

Screenshot attached.

How are you going?

Miike

Several pairs are bound between small ranges, im not liking this current enviornment too much.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi Guys,

I've been in this trade for a while now, but it is now signalling an entry.

GBPNZD hit the trend line resistance, then close below the 10SMA, with the 200SMA in down trend. it's currently sitting right on the support line at around 1.8784, if broken it will head down to the next support at 1.8642.

Note: 1.8542 is the lowest I have in my chart from 2008-2012, anyone know the next support pre-2008? I don't have time to get historical data.

Screenshot attached.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hi Guys,

Closed my GBPNZD at a small BE+10. So happy with the small profit before it went up quickly.

With this strategy:

SL: 1.0760

TP: 1.0660

Pips: -23.6

Hi BK,

Great system, well done

Maybe you could consider refining your entries and exits?

Entries

ie do not take a new trade unless its from an area where we expect a price to start trending

Where do new trends start from -

1  After a period of consolidation (breakout)

2  A trend reversal

3  A trend continuation

If our entry is not from one of these areas - then our trade is not likely to amount to much

Exits

Also when we are in a winning trade, we could consider an exit prior to price crossing our ma if:

We get evidence of price weakening or price velocity at an unsustainable extreme

The problems are we need some means of identifying when these situations occur/likely occur

I would really appreciate your  and other members views on this and how they identify the conditions mentioned above

From another old timer

Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Mike,

I love what the D1 w/ 10 SMA strategy has done for my trading.  I am much more R and S adn candle savvy; however, I admit my main trading chart is the H4 using 3,10,21, and 200 SMA's with D1 and W1 for confirmation.  I study the H4 for trend corresponding with strong SMA angles.  I have done well trading long both the EUR/CAD and the EUR/AUD the past two trading days; these pairs remain open.  If I did not find these trade by using the D1 w/ 10 SMA strategy, I may not have entered the trades.

Good trading,

Judy

--- 帖子 #568 ---

Hi Miike,

I do not place a trade before I draw Resistance and Support lines on H4, D1, W1 charts.  "Adn" was a typo that should have been spelled "and."

Good trading,

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Judy,

Very nice

How do you use your ma's?

Do you look for the 10 and 21 ma's to start running equi distant from each other indicating a steady sustainable trend, the wait for price to break above the last nearby resistance (pivot high)?, and then enter

How do you exit, a break and close below the 10sma on the 4hr chart?

The last bar on the EURAUD H4 chart looks a bit ominous - who knows

well done, thank you

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi Lizpet,

I enter a trade on the H4 after the 3 and 10 SMA's have crossed and have angle and separation.  I will not enter a trade if support or resistance (depending on the trade) are too nearby.  With the EUR/AUD, I drew a W1 fibo.  The pair has a long way to go to hit R and consolidation just above 50% retracement; however, I will monitor whether the (H4) 3 and 10 SMA's to see if they cross in the opposite direction.  If the latter happens, I will exit and wait for another possible entry with the same pair or look elsewhere for an entry.  I use the 21 SMA for extra proof of a trend.

It would be wonderful to see a long trend with both the EUR/CAD and the EUR/AUD.  We shall see.

Thank you for your questions.

Judy

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hi FaRa,

Like you , I think this pair is in a trading range just now - but who's to say that it will not breakout although the odds are that resistance will hold

The 4hr chart builds the daily chart and the 4hr chart now shows price was rejected, forming a shooting star? at the last "major" high

So it looks like the odds are that some form of reversal is going to occur

(and the 1hr chart is showing a large bearish engulfing candle)

Regards

Peter

PS If you convert your candlestick chart to a line chart, the trace often gives a good indication of what to expect next and when we take a new (or exit a trade)trade, it can pay to make sure that the line chart confirms our trade ie a break of the current hi/lo sequence agrees with our trade, the last pivot lo/hi has been breached, a trendline has been breached , a pattern has been breached etc, etc which ever applies

I mainly use the line charts to locate support and resistance levels

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Judy,

Thank you for the explanation of your use of your ma's - logical

Using the 3/10 ma cross ties in very nicely with BK's cross of the 10sma

Personally I use the 8ema - and use the same trading principle as BK

I do not like giving back too much profit and often exit a trade before price breaks the 10sma (8ema), which tends to defeat the reason for using the 10sma - but that's just me

I use various methods for this but the most simple is the use of the simple line chart and the application of Dow Theory ie for an uptrend -a trend is in place so long as it keeps making higher highs and higher lows (obviously the opposite applies for a downtrend) a break of this sequence indicates an end of the trend, price will either go sideways or reverse

Have a nice day

Peter

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Not much happening on the daily - but the 4hr charts look promising and could lead to trades on the daily

Here are some on the 4hr charts that may be worth following up

GBPAUS - short

AUDCAD - short

EURGBP - short

AUSUSD - short

AUDCHF looks like a reversal forming - watch for a long

The YEN is getting hammered by all the other currencies and is starting to look a bit over extended - but trends can go farther than one reasonably expects..........

Take care

Hi BKG,

Sincere thanks for this very, very helpful thread.

And, also for this latest (detailed) watch list.

Almost, all the pairs appear to be at cross roads.

In such a case, how do we decide the next trade ?

Do we re-evaluate these pairs at the market opening this evening or at the close of daily candle on Monday evening (Sunday daily candle being insignificant - only one or two hours in duration) ?

Need your guidance, please.

Regards.

Hi,

can you help me to fix this? I have attach a ascreenshot, the support and resistance lines are very far away from the price, and on other pairs it dosen't even show. Is there anything that needs to be change in the BKG ea?

thank you

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Not sure what causes that but it has happened to me before. Double click the line and then drag it to where you think s/r levels are. Then double click it again to make sure it gets locked in place.

[quote=bkg102665;5420558]We have had a few pairs close with a full candle so I am curious as to how they will play out. Several have closed at resistance area or 200sma so keep your eye on this.[/QUOTE

bkg i was under the impression that we would only be looking at candles which have just crossed the 10sma

Sorry for my ignorance

--- 帖子 #584 ---
[quote=don555;5420718]
No problem friend. I just like to look at full candles as a place for price to turn in the opposite direction. I really get interesteded if they are at support / resistance areas or 200sma. If it happens at s/r area and 200sma I really like it!!

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi BKG, I have noticed that in all the charts you shared at post 578 and 579, you drew an arrow at every signal candle, no matter if it was a small insignificant candle or a strong candle. So, I want to know if you have entered a trade in all this signals. If this is the case, don't you have a huge trading cost because of the fails?

I love this thread.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
[quote=bkg102665;5420772]

bkg if price was to turn at those areas is that a reason to enter or do we still wait for the 10sma to  cross which seems a long way away in a lot of pairs

--- 帖子 #587 ---
[quote=don555;5420813]
This is a 10sma thread so we would not take a trade until it crosses the 10sma. I just like to give you things to look for and help you learn. I like to give you tools that I use for POSSIBLE upcoming trades, trends, and so on.

--- 帖子 #588 ---

Okay fully understood if I ask questions and get straight answers then I am able to learn.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I BKG, great posts of potential setups and market analysis.

Keep up the great work!

Market just opened with quite small gaps.

Will keep an eye on what happens today, considering the close of some of the pairs on key s/r levels.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #590 ---
MIGMAC you might try removing the ea from your chart and put it on again

that fixed mine ...........lol

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi Guys,

The BKG EA has the ability to move the lines. It does have automation of line placement for S/R lines, however these are NOT always accurate and you need to place the S/R Lines manually in these cases.

There are 2 ways:

1:

Double click on the S/R line to move, you will see a small square on the far right of the line, click this and drag to place the S/R line. Once competed, double click to fix the position.

2: Open the Object browser, click on "tick selected" on the S/R Line. Then close the Object browser. You will see a small square on the far right of the line, click this and drag to place the S/R line. Once competed go back to the object browser and de-select the S/R Line to fix the position.

Hope this helps...

Miike

Hi Guys,

From last week continued...

1. Last weeks total: +62.2

2. USDCAD: +26.5 - closed out due to hitting key 200SMA resistance...looks to continue short from here.

3. AUDUSD: +10 - closed due to bounce off the 61.8% fib.

Total from last weeks trades: 98.7 pips.

Now on to a new week

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #594 ---
It turn out to be really good technique. I use this along with  Symphonie SentimentEmotion Combi Indikator, which gave me impressive result, average 100 pips weekly and I don't have to watch the candlestick that often.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Nice.....

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Any chance you would share with the thread? Interested in what this indicator is...

Cheers,

I was really being sarcastic, what the hell is "Symphonie SentimentEmotion Combi Indikator" lol. Guys lets stay on track here with s/r levels and 10sma.

BKG, picked that up, thus my interest in what kind of weird indicator it was.

Looks like the market is ranging at the moment.

Back to basics everyone

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I am not going anywhere I promise. I know you guys like to look at other indicators and that is fine but if you do not mind do it in a private message or some other way. I have seen to many threads get clogged up with off key things. I have been doing this for what seems a life time and I have lost thousands of dollars trying different things. I do not blame anyone for trying something different but not here please.

Enough on that....... now lets make some pips!!!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I apologise for posting that up, just sharing, thats all. Not meaning of hijacking nor anything else. Yeah, let get back to topic.

Btw, ranging market is really bad. Patient is really a virtue now. I didn't enter any trade.

Sorry for my English.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I wouldnt say ranging is bad, you just have to pick your spots.  If a pair is range bound between 2 s/r areas , depending how close they are you can play the pivots back and forth.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
The arrows appear because the indicator is built that way. I do not take every trade that has an arrow. Are you using the indicator? If you are the arrows should appear on your chart also. You can find the indicator on post #12

--- 帖子 #605 ---
bkg is that trade explorer account in your profile accuarate?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Not really. I use two accounts and I do alot of experimental stuff on that particular account. I am always playing with new ideas and stuff.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
oh ok, that makes more sense, just didnt seem to match up with some of the trades you have posted in this thread.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
That is where I try new ideas and practice with indicators and EA's from time to time. Please do not pay it any attention. I thought I had it private but I guess I did not. It is private now. Thanks

--- 帖子 #609 ---
BKG, thanks for your answer!! I'm not using the indicator, I'm doing all manually. Can I use this indicator on Metatrader 5?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I am not sure if it is mt5 compatible or not?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Speaking of EA's I have been working with one and I am adding it to a demo account today to track success. I am going to take every trade that the indicator tells me to on 18 different pairs. I will do my best to post the results daily. Let's see what happens. The account has $5000 to start.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
what about other time frame and 10sma ? did you test it ?

thanx

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I have not tested it because my life style is bettered suited for daily timeframe trades. Feel free to try it if you like but its not what this thread is about.

Guys I promise you I have given you something here that will work if you will learn to work it as I have talked about. I use to be a member of a "GREAT" thread but people kept trying to change the thread and finally the starter of the thread left to never return. I now understand why he got frustrated. Most of what I learned I learned from him. He is missed by all that followed his thread. Please lets stay on track here and talk about "Daily 10SMA w/ S/R Levels".Thanks

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi folks this pair looks good. May close above resistance and above 10 sma tonight.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
As we are already above the 10sma for the 2nd day it might be best looking to go long after all the resistance is cleared i.e 8430. it is either there or around 8360 imho

Olu

--- 帖子 #616 ---
ok thnx

--- 帖子 #617 ---
EA got us in three trades tonight.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Use 'File -> New Chart' and they will be stored as tabs at the bottom of the chart screen.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
will the EA adjust the S/L if the trade goes your way?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Right now I have the intial s/l at 200 but as soon as you get up 50 pips s/l moves to +5. If prices crosses back and closes on the opposite side of the 10sma it will take you out and enter you in the other direction. Just something I am playing with so dont get excited just yet.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
In all honesty I don't really think an EA will be as profitable as manually taking trades.

I get emailed via the 10SMA indicator every morning when the daily candle closes. I then compare these from the trades I checked the night before and wrote down for potential setups. Of these I will mostly take less than 50% of them. The best way to make use of an EA with this strategy is the one I created to manage open trades.

Sure EAs will keep emotional decisions out of your trading but sometimes decisions are required. Take the GBPUSD from Friday, there is no way I would take that trade since it travelled so far from the 10SMA in the one candle where the EA would have you at a floating -60 right now and it still has not crossed the 10SMA the opposite way

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Like I said I am just playing around on a demo account. I do not think I would ever use an EA to trade this but still want to see what happens. As slow paced as this stratagy is, if you cant trade this without an EA you probably dont have time to trade period.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Haha yeah I 100% agree. Did anyone catch USDCAD today? I'm sitting at +20 but this is a very slow moving pair and it's 14day ATR is only 59 pips, I wonder if I should lock in 50% sooner?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
looks like a great system..highger timefram is always very reliable and accurate...

FOrex Factory is a great site...it brings all the traders in the world to one place...wow...good effort

great service

thanks

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi BKG,

EA sounds interesting. I think that as Rockz said, this strategy is best suited to a manual trader. One of my main considerations with an EA with how we trade these signals is that we also identify trends, channels and long reversal candles that could add elements of risk to a trade. These can be managed within an EA, but I am still yet to find an EA or even an indicator that can do this with great accuracy. Looking forward to your results and success

Great email earlier with your trades.

I am also looking at BUY NZDUSD, the signal candle is close to the current resistance, however if it breaks the resistance, and considering the 10SMA and 200SMA is trending up it has potential for a move to 0.8571, 0.8841 resistance levels.

Screenshots attached.

Cheers,

Miike

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi BKG,

Ever since you launched this thread, I have tried (almost religiously) to follow it to a tee, to the best of my limited ability.

I am trading your system on a live account (very small positions, though) strictly as per your guidelines and rules, without any other addition, alteration or contamination.

So far, results have been positive and encouraging.

There have been some failures, but most of those due to my own mistakes, misjudgements or missteps.

Now today, you have entered shorts on GBPAUD & GBPNZD on a signal as per your EA.

However, I am already in these trades since February 24th (though currently, both happen to be slightly under water).

I review all the pairs daily asap after 19.00 EST, when my broker's (IBFX - Australia) platform closes their daily candle.

I must be doing something wrong to have entered these trades 3 days pre-maturaly.

Yet, when I review my entering these two trades on Feb 24th, I really do not see any fault.

Am I missing something, quite simple or very complicated ?

Unfortunately, I am not computer-saavy enough yet to be able to upload the charts with my trade entries.

Working on it though.

I Would be grateful to you, if you could kindly review these entries of today as well as on February 24th and point out the discrepancies in my analysis

Thanks and regards.

hi

what about it ?

is it right to open S whet price crosses the 10sma from above?http://www15.speedyshare.com/file/my...d/Untitled.jpg

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I think you are describing our standard cross.

When price is above the 10sma and slices down through it and closes below it. This is a sell

When price is below the 10sma and it slices through it upwards  and closes above it  - this is a buy

If my attempt to answer your question was rubbish please expand more...

Olu

--- 帖子 #629 ---
use alert on page 1 post 12. this puts sma and arrows. you cant go wrong...great inducator...........again thanks to BK

--- 帖子 #630 ---
ok tkanks for your answer

you said if the daily candle close above/below 10sma. im new one in fx, and what i have seen i can compare with real tradning. 'When price is above the 10sma and slices down through it and closes below it. This is a sell' - so in the next candle i should sell on her highest level ?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Alwaro,

Let me clarify if I can...

According to your chart, the price has attempted a break of the trend resistance and moved down, given the price does not break the resistance and starts moving down and has a close below the 10SMA, this would indicate a SELL. However, I would recommend recognising the 200SMA to validate your entry.

Hope this helps...

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #632 ---
ok, thanks

how 200sma can validate my entry ?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Just got long NZDUSD on break of the 10sma, in nice long term trend and currently above 10/31/2011 swing high, stop @ .8150 (giving this puppy some room to bounce around).

Great system and thread BKG.

Jon

--- 帖子 #634 ---
If below 200SMA, go short, if above 200SMA, go long.

Refer to Post 163.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi Jon,

I've been monitoring this trade as well. I'm currently holding out on it due to 2 reasons.

1. Ideally the entry should have been made after the 23/2 candle, as it is thie first break of the 10SMA after testing support at 8259. This would have given an entry with room to move to the next resistance at around 8426.

2. Keep an eye on the 8426 resistance. it's a daily and weekly resistance and could cause a retracement.

If you do manage to hold on and it does break, it has a great amount of pips to the next key resistance levels.

Hope this goes your way for some big pips

BKG, what's your opinion on this type of trade potential, given that the break of the 10SMA is the 2nd long 10SMA break after testing support. Is it a valid position when the entry of the signal candles close is so close to a resistance at a daily/weekly time frame?

If it does break, it would be an excellent trade!

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Not trying to be a wet rag but are we not supposed to enter after the candle closes above 10 SMA?  The day is not yet over.

Can we get in before the candle is closed?  Also the color of the candle is a bit worrying.  It is a bearish candle and has pierced the body of yesterday's candle to quite a degree.  Ofcourse there is still time for it to come back up before closing tonight.  But a bit risky  as we are going against the rules of 10 SMA system.

Just my two cents

DD

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Just to clarify this, once a candle breaks the 10sma that is our signal to go but we can wait and see if price tucks back in around the 10sma for a better entry. Two reasons for this thought process:

1) You get a better entry price

2) If it does reverse and cross back over the 10sma then your loss is less

--- 帖子 #638 ---
The rules are entry after a close.

Anything else and we are trading another system. Of course you can have another system for different conditions but if we dont stick to the rules we cant do a proper forward test of the system and earn the most from the system. The system is good in itself without any additions.

Olu

--- 帖子 #639 ---
The pair closed yesterday above the 10ma, I generally trade around the New York open for a few hours based on the past day's closing price.

Mike also made a great point that the optimal entry for this trade was on Feb 23.  The market's offered a 2nd chance on this entry, keeping in mind that although it's above the late October 2011 swing high, it faces some resistance, thus I've given it a wider than normal s/l.  If it breaks higher, it should run nicely.

General trend of the pair remains up.

Of course the market will be the final arbiter of this trade...

Hello Lizpet, Sniperfxmy, and Don555,

Once the snags are virtually gone, and I have a 75:25 winners-to-losers trading ratio, and I am trading "live," I shall open a thread.  My interest in the H4 and how it relates to bigger pip trades on the Day Chart w/ 10 SMA kept me out of the chancy EURO pairs this morning.  I will not trade during a consolidation period on the H4 or the Day Chart methods.  As usual, at least in my case, both a handsome trend and support or resistance clearance are the name of the game.

Best consistent profits to you all,

Judy

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hey, this is my first post, but fondly reading all the posts. I might skip this on. We have that round number just below (psychological support) and it is also a pivot point, where price might find some support. Sell resistance, buy support.

2 pb appeared already. i trade it with a proper mm

worth to trade this pair, like oz and cad, with a proper mm...

the monthly charts showing these 3 pairs having similar formations: mb+pb

once mb is crossed, looking to see the trend to stay for the near term

p. s. i don't use 200ma bcos it is "far" from 10ma... unless 1 or 2 candles apart. mike's post 625 showing a flat 200ma, at times it is not an easy task to justify a trade? ones would have missed a month of profit opportunity for not trading starting on Dec 20 even thou 10 was under 200.

it is a 3tr trial the bull candle broke up 20sma in a month.

trade it with care (mm) as it is just 1 to 2 candles distance from 200sma.

Hi Guys,

Grooler beat me to it buy a min or two, but here is my analysis...

Personally I like the USDCAD trade.

I've entered short at 0.9934 on the close of the 10SMA break at 0.9938.

Recently the 1.0048 resistance was tested (as well a the SMA200) and failed to break out.

The price looks to be ranging between 0.9899 to 1.0048 on the weekly.

It looks to be heading down in accordance with this system to test the support at 9899 and if broken has room to move down to the next support at 0.9783.

Chart attached.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Yep, I am in the same USDCAD trade, I entered a few hours early on the Pinbar @ 0.99882. I have taken off half now and moved stop to BE+1. Ill let the rest go I am getting positive swap so getting cash either way

The AUDNZD trade was another that I wrote down last night and inspected this morning on the candle open. But there was no way I was going to take it when it was right in the face of a downward 200SMA plus the size of the bull candle that closed past the 10SMA was too large.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi Rokz,

Your entry was not aligned with this strategy, as the pin bar was not a close of the 10SMA cross.

Still a top entry in terms of a profitable trade.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #653 ---
How do you all feel about the GBPNZD ? The setup doesnt look too bad. its just that the risk/reward ratio does not seem too good, especially since its had trouble breaking the 1.875 resistance.

You need to wait for the close of the signal candle to confirm the entry.

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #660 ---
AudChf will be a good one to watch tonight if it can stay and close above the 10 at end of day. It has 200+ pips to run if it can work past the resistance it is chopping at right now

--- 帖子 #661 ---
bkg the full candles that you had posted up on Sunday what  I have noticed on Monday they all formed smaller candles in the same direction and on Tuesday they all formed larger candles in the opposite direction and 4 of the pairs are all heading across the 10sma as we watch, and the 2 jpy pairs are heading in the same direction.

Why did you pick those 6 pairs?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Yeah mate I'm fully aware of that, but how could I resist such a sexy candle screaming out 'Sell Me!, Sell Me!'....

+101 at the moment.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
I was just showing how when candles close full a lot of times they will head in the opposite direction the next day or so. Sometimes when you see a candle close full at 200sma or s/r area it's a good place to take your profit.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Yes I have noticed the same thing, these large candles often point to a possible reversal point which is good for profit taking.

No they wouldn't...

I am talking about candles such as these,

http://i43.tinypic.com/2yye0c6.png

This big blue candle closed above the 10SMA, way to large to convince me to trade with it. Plus the 200SMA provided resistance.

EDIT : Don't confuse S&R lines for Order Lines, realised similarities once I uploaded it.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
On my chart as you can see the long candle closed above the 10sma and my 200sma. I waited for price to back up for a better entry. You can look left on my chart and see this has been s/r area in the past so I went long on this pair. We will see where it goes from here. This may or may not work but that is my thought process for entering this trade.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Oh you were buying there...I have written this in my journal as a sell. If I wake up and it's down I am going to be all over it like white on rice. The trend is down for ALL timeframes don't fight it.

This would be my analysis of your pic that you had submitted,

(I am using a 200SMA I think you may be using an EMA)

http://i42.tinypic.com/2ywsg7s.gif

Don't forget your 200MA can be S&R also. This is my opinion so don't take my word for it just throwing ideas around.

Hi BKG,

How did you go overnight with your open trades?

It was going all nice for me when I went to sleep, then the market turned and punished me.

Lesson here: Always follow money management rules to protect your capital!

CLOSED:

1. GBPNZD

- SELL - 1.8852

- CLOSE - 1.9037

- P/L: -195 pips

- Got smashed on reversal. Lucky I have strong MM in place, only a 1.2% loss.

OPEN:

2. AUDUSD

- BUY - 1.0764

- CP - 1.0733

- P/L:  -31 pips

- Currently holding above the 10SMA.

3. GBPAUD

- SELL - 1.4713

- CP - 1.4835

- P/L: -122 pips

- Testing resistance at 1.4841. Looks to be holding. Still ranging, expect it to go short during the asian trading session.

4. USDCAD

- SELL - 0.9972

- CP - 0.9891

- P/L: +81 pips

- Support has been broken, I expect it to run down to test 0.9738 support.

Total Open: -72 pips

Cheers,

Miike

This is what I look for in a trade. This trade may fail miserably but I will take it every time. 1) bounced off support 2) above 10sma and 200sma 3) broke trendline from 2 or 3 months ago.

It may not work but like I said this is what I like to see and I will take it every time!!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
I got spanked on one but my suggestion to you would be, never be in four trades unless you have moved your s/l to positive number. Be smarter than the market. Me or no one else can tell you where price will go. We have to use the past as a guide for the future but that does not always work. As trade one is locked in profit get tin trade two, lock in profit and get in trade three, on so on.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Yeahhh!!! Thats a 100% Perfect Setup!!!!

Thanks Mate,

Good advice, it's a lesson learned.

No matter how much you experience, there's always something new to learn and look out for!

Hi guys, I entered this trade. I know that is not a perfect set up, but I will trade it.

This is my trading plan...

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Yeah I do think this is a valid trade however

I would like to discussed this and need a help with entry point.

As we all can see it is a valid signal we are below sma and a resistance as pictured below

[IMG]http://www.forexfactory.com/ Inserted Code http://speedy.sh/pa8v8/nzd-usd-daily.gif
[/IMG]

however on H1 there is a valid short term buy signal so what you guys would do? would you wait for candle formation on H1 suggesting further drop and enter higher or simply enter now and pu a larger SL(Bigger risk?)

Lol, that's what I linked. My 10SMA hasn't been crossed yet .

Right I am bit confused however wish to know your opinion about entry point any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
EUR/NZD - I would go long and the target around 1.72 bottom trendline touched on 1W and I am expecting the price bounce up.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I'm going to avoid that one for today, maybe if it closes lower tomorrow I'll revise it. Only one I took today with these rules is NZDUSD which is a bit of a gamble since I am fighting a trend.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Did you go long or short ?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi everybody,

I watched a Stephen Bigalow webinar yesterday.

Here's a bit of info he gave that may be of use to us:

When we have a market in a tight range (ma going flat) he suggested that we should use a 2ema together with the 8ema (our 10ema) to help filter out false signals.

ie only take signals when the ma's cross

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Really? Did you look at the chart?

I was just gonna see if I think the same way  But I will wait 12hr o so to see what happen.http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

thanx, wish you many pips

Besides, there is a few reasons why i would go long, but not following this strategy, so let's stick to the rules.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I have to be on the road all day today so I have locked in profit +1 since I am only up around 50 pips or so. Now I do not care what happens and I will look for another trade tonight when I get home. Trade well today friends!!!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Looking forward to when you get started Judy as it seems that this system of bkgs integrated with your own which has already kept you out of chancy trades can only be a good thing.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
what about short on eurusd?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Multiple Timeframes is my preferred application also

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Personally I would stay away from it at the present time for 3 reasons

1/to near support

2/in strong upward trend

3/ after large candle crossing with 1&2 reasons given  I would be looking for a reversal

But who knows just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
When I first found this thread my first thought was take every candle that crosses the 10sma even taking support and resistance into consideration.

But even now after a few weeks it is not as easy as it first seemed.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Hi bkg102665,

I like your trendline method.

I just find you open a new thread. I like this method too.

You are a professional trader.

I followed your method, here is my first entry as this method.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Hi Don,

I understand your thoughts. And this method is simple, but not easy.

But to my understanding, EURUSD looks a good short.

I would like to see whether the 1.32 reverse the falling.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I have a slightly different view for this setup. Looks like we are testing the support, turned resistance. If price closes below the 10SMA , I would be looking to sell. Profit targets look a bit better too. I'll wait and see.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Stick to the pure system. It works...

People cant help tinkering with set systems. The beauty of this system is its simplicity. Try making a trading decision with a daily chart with 3 MAs, MACD, RSI, ADX and PSAR on it. Analysis paralysis.

Just ignore posts that add one thing or another to the set system

Hi Guys,

Did anyone catch the USDCAD trade over the last 2 days?

Shorted on close of signal candle at 0.9934 and increased my lots on retracement at 0.9888. Following BKG's advice, load up into a profitable trade.

Currently heading to test support at 0.9843 which I expect to be broken as the 0.9890 resistance has been broken.

I've moved stops tightly to 0.9912, which I will move to later if it continues to move down.

My TP is at around 0.9783 - 0.9727

Screenshot attached.

Hope some of you caught this one with me! Happy pipping

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Jip, I'm in it, but entered on the retracement.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I'm bullish on the Canadian Dollar too Mike!

--- 帖子 #716 ---
but it has already crossed belwe the 10sma. so valid short.

or do you prefer to wait for a pullback to the 10sma then enter ?

are any of you open to the idea of having a new thread that only is for posting signals generated by this system ? i.e. a signal thread for this system.  on all pairs.

i think it would be a good idea. i wonder what bk thinks ?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
I know it has, but the previous time it crossed was into support. Price has broken that support and is retesting that level for resistance. I have 2 options. Get a better price as it is testing that resistance level or be conservative and wait for it to close below the 10SMA again. Sell resistance, buy support.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Thank you!!

Is anybody getting this?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
You are welcome to post the signals here.......

--- 帖子 #720 ---
A bettor idea because if we are wrong in our decisions we have always got bkg to help us out and explain where we have made a mistake, and after all it is his thread.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Again BKG, thank you for your successful trading system.  I follow your simple guidelines becuse the method is clean and it works.

Just for me, however, I pick better (trending) pairs when I also analyse the H4.  Basically, I will not enter a trade if there is too much noise (as you call it) on the H4.  The H4 pair must be trending (even somewhat mildly) with both SMA's (3 and 10) headed, with angle and separation, in the trade direction.

At the opening candle yesterday on both the EUR/CAD and the EUR/AUD (both pairs closed below the 10 SMA, and drew a (D1) FIBO on each chart; the pairs were both below the 38.2% fibo retracement which is important to me  I also use the 3 SMA on the D1 chart for crosses withthe 10 SMA and trend information.  Since the 3 and 10 SMA's crossed on both closing candles, both pairs looked great for a short entries.  You can see the results.  I have closed half of my position and placed a new stop between the current price and my entry price so I will still have a profit if the trade is "stopped out."

Thank you BKG, and please share your thoughts.

Judy

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Well done on both of those trades  Judy now I have got an understanding what your reasons are for taking bkgs trades or not

Hi Judy , I like you idea. I am always looking for a way to help filter bad , or less probable trades.  I also saw the EURCAD trade last night but that big push thru candle made it to expensive for me to trade (SL).  But you had some good Trades

--- 帖子 #725 ---
BKG,

There's a lot of discussion on the entry signal and validation of a good entry.

But not much around the point of exiting in profit.

What are the main conditions that you would close out your position in this strategy?

e.g.

1. Large candle with high/close or low/close at same point

2. Daily resistance / support hit

3. Reversal due to a common pattern, such as double top/bottom and head/shoulders

4. Fibonacci retracements

5. Reversal and trailing SL hit.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I do not use fibs or trailing stops but the others would be good reason to exit a trade.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Thanks BKG,

Are there any other majours that you look for?

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Hi Miike,

That's a tough one and timely exiting is a work in progress for me.  For instance, I exited the E/A today far too early, half at 1.2460 and half at 1.2457, after initially making a short entry at 1.2411.  As you can see, the pair went to 2.3088, and another 51/54 pips in the right direction.

The reason I exited was the consolidation to the left on the D1 chart.  That exit would be under your category 2.  I always look at the nuances of sequential candles, e.g. condition 1.   I do not use trailing stops, though I often change my stops to lock in profits in case of a reversal: something like condition 5.

It just may be sometimes an exit may be as simple as the 3 SMA crossing the 10 SMA in the opposite direction n the M30.  I will check it out over time.  One thing that gives me pause (reason to exit) is a consolidation pattern of candles on the H4 after a D! trend.  I will exit when this occurs.

Let me know what you think.  I trust I answered your questions.

Judy

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Thanks Judy,

Was interested in the exits that BKG uses in this strategy.

Personally I think it is best to monitor for:

1. Large candle with high/close or low/close at same point

2. Daily resistance / support hit

3. Reversal due to a common pattern, such as double top/bottom and head/shoulders

4. Fibonacci retracements

However, it really needs to be analysed case by case.

I also move my stops tighter depending on market volatility as the trade moves into profit.

At the end of the day, there's no shame in closing a trade in profit early.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi bkg thanks for the simple system.

I've been following the thread for a while and decided to join to share some of my trade ideas.

One i'm looking at is the AUD/USD. It's reached resistance at 1.0760 and consolidating. It could break the resistance and target you a profit of 200+ pips as it moves towards strong resistance reached in July last year. However, i'm keeping an eye out for a reversal as it's reaching strong resistance. Once it closes under the 10sma and passes that support in the consolidating area, i'll look to go short.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Yes, BKG,

Do you have a summary about the exit condition?

Thanks.

I am also wondering any unique condition you will exit? Thanks!

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi Xtrammer,

There would be huge resistance above 1.0850. That would be a high score short entry (set and forget) by Sam Seiden's method.

So be careful to that long chance.

The 1.0850 would be a big resistance, so this is a long at resistance. Be careful.

Just my 2 cents.

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Thanks for the reply. I'll look into going short

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Hi BKG, your method is great.

As last post, long USDCHF

+60Pips, move to the +5.

I like your method.

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #735 ---
As last post, short EURUSD, now move +5 pips.

1.32 would have big support, be careful.

Free run now, anyway.

BKG, i like your method.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Well done I was obviously wrong on my assumptions about this pair.

Lesson learned no more predicting for me after the candle has crossed the 10sma

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Although I don't often trade on Fridays, I Just got short AUDCAD, closed below 10ma on Feb 29, then retested it.  This paid is not as subject to the 'risk on/risk off' trade that some other pairs are.  Stop @ 1.077

Jon

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hi Don,

Actually, i also have the confusion whether to treat the cross 10sma with the universal action.

As BKG proposed, we would treat it universally. But i feel i would like to treat them differently. My criteria would be the support/resistance, but this criteria is subjective, not objective.

For EURUSD case, since the 1.34 is a bigger level than 1.33, and it was broken down with a big BEOB, so i would assume the 1.33 would be broken too. That is my reason, subjective.

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Friday Update: Increased my account by 13% this week trading this method( very good week, not typical ), that's including a 1% SL hit on a GBPCAD trade( only loss this week  ). I still have 2 runners, the AUDCHF and EURAUD,  most of the lots on these trades were already closed out but a portion was left on well beyond BE.

Good Weekend to Everyone

Hi Guys,

Fantastic week. It's really good to hear that people are having great success.

BKG, your goal of helping others be successful is admirable and paying dividends as you can see!

Well done to everyone.

I've closed out my own trades this week before the weekly close.

Ended my week with +52 pips, not as many as I hoped for. However I made 1 trade that hurt me costing me 120 pips. Lucky I closed this out as it ended up hitting my initial SL at 150 pips.

Looking forward to next week!

Cheers,

Miike

Hi bkg...

If you got a chance, please have a look at GBP/USD. In my chart it is below SMA10 and SMA200, what do you think? Please let me know your opinion. Thanks... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/editor/smilie.gif

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Lets wait and see where price opens up. If it opens below the 10sma then I would have to say yes it is a valid trade.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
So looking at the e/u now, 3-4-12 what are your feelings?  It has been below 10 ema for a few days...1.3163 support or so and the gap there on the 4 hour chart, when would you take this trade if at all?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
It is too far from the 10sma. DO NOT trake it!

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Hi Guys,

I like the look of the GU and have shorted.

It opened below the 10 SMA and 200 SMA, looks to be heading south to test the 1.5646 support.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hi Miike,

Before express my idea, i would emphasize i am not a good trader so far. The following is just my 2 cents.

For the GU pair, I am also looking at this pair, however i would want to look a bit long.

Reason:

1) Daily trend up (higher high, lower low)

2) Weekly ranging, however, last week close above 1.5829, actually 2/27, 2/28 and Friday all close above 1.5829. If it close more below 1.5826, i would feel better. At this time, i would assume the 1.5829 is a support, i don't see a close below it

3)Today is Monday, whether a return back to 1.5900 (Monday sometimes will give a retrace)

Basically, i would wait to see

1) how Candle actions at 1.5900, if retrace back

2) More better, if 1.60 met, how candle actions there.

did any one take that trade.... eujpy.....thanks texan

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Thanks for you tips.

There is always analysis that you can apply which will contradict any position. If you use other analysis as indicators against this system which does not use them, you are not going to have any consistency with your trading.

Given the conditions of this strategy, I see going short a valid trade.

If it goes well or not if up to the market. All I can do is make sure I have used the strategy correctly, implemented good MM and monitor for any unexpected events for a reversal.

Currently heading down and is +19 pips. I expect a test of support at 1.58009 / 1.5798 area, if it breaks, I expect to start heading down to 1.5646. Alternatively, it could also hit the 1.58009 / 1.5779 support area's and reverse.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi Texan,

I've had a look at your trade. To be a valid trade with this strategy, the rebound off a resistance / support needs to occur prior to the 10 SMA cross.

Can you provide a screen shot of your analysis.

My S/R levels are in the attached screenshot, although a bit overkill.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hi Mike,

Basically, i agree with your analysis.

I may express my idea a bit not clear. Actually, i follow this thread's rule.

To my understanding for this system, two criterias should be matched:

1)Candle closed below daily candle (Down case). This is a perfect match

What would cause argument would be the second issue

2) Sell at resistance, while buy at support

I would take the 1.5826 as a big support. I.e. this is a sell at support to what i think.

Emphasize again, i don't mean to defy anybody's idea, just express a bit of my 2 cents during my learning. Thanks!

I don't want to argue you are not correct to put this entry, i just put my 2 cents as my learning curve grows.

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hi szpowerx,

Fair enough,

S/R level are subjective.

For my resistance, you can refer to the daily march and april 2011 periods.

Time will tell

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi Texan,

I use the BKG indicator sometime on my home laptop.

On my server (vps) where my trades occur and I take captures from work, I do not use an EA. My S/R lines are manual.

Be aware that even the BKG EA will need manual changes to S/R.

Too much resistance on the GU trade.

Decided to close and look for a better trade.

+17.3 pips

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #762 ---
HI Miike,

Hopefully, not my disturbance to make you close it.

Since this thread is on daily candle, besides i learned many times "plan the trade, trade the plan"

A close during the middle day would be a bit hurry from my point of view, IMHO.

This would make me to ask again, BKG, will you please mind to summarize an exit guideline? This would be a great help to the common level trader like me.

Thanks in advance!

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Thanks for the consideration...

Decision was based on further analysis and a strong support holding up. Decided it was best to close in profit than hit my stop.

Waiting on a better opportunity.

All the best!

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I know this is a bit earlier, not close yet.

But can we assume it would be closed below 10sma?

66.65 is a big support in weekly, if you enter now, you have to take the risk for short at support

However, looks like deserve a try, 1st target: 65 2nd target 63.5

--- 帖子 #765 ---
DO NOT enter this trade until the candle closes. There is no reason to go short here. Chances are price will back up closer to the 10sma. PATIENCE!!

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I would like to echo what BK has said. Keep to the system. All the yen pairs are reversing and you most certainly will get a better price if you wait. If 'risk' comes into the market who knows you might want to pass on this trade. The candle must close before any trade decisions are made. If you have another system that says sell then by all means sell. But this thread's system is giving just the amber light not green to sell...

Olu

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Yes, thanks BKG.

Too risk to open an entry before daily candle close. No need to take this kind of risk at all.

And keep to the system is important, thanks Olu.

B.R.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Mike where did you see the too much resistance that you were talking about

which made you close the trade

--- 帖子 #769 ---
This is traffic, resistance, consolidation, all the above. It may go below this area but it will struggle to do so probably. We must be able to recognize this on a chart.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
On your chart you have a major event area marked in blue 1.56801 which is about 150 pips away when you came out.

What I am trying to get at is why did you come out when you did.

I was in this trade also and came out not long after you.

bkg sorry I thought I was responding to mike but you can carry on explaining if you dont mind.

So if a 10sma cross is in a consilidation channel are we better to leave it well alone.

Really enjoying this thread thanks BKG for starting and sharing great stuff here are some trades I took last night on the open

EUR/JPY: closed below 10sma started as a good winner but retraced as has been mentioned obviously not liking the look of the candle now so may close this for small profit due to the correlation as well.

NZU/USD Long candle that closed below nearly a BEOB so could have looked for the retrace but got in short liked the fake out at the top as well looking to trade it down to the 200ma

GBP/USD - been discussed earlier hit support now gone in the red

AUD/USD - same as NZD

--- 帖子 #774 ---
got shot signal for AUDUSD today.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Anyone thinking of a long on USD/CAD? looks alright to me

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Short entry on the above pair appears far too early. Support not cleared and a sideways 200 SMA.

Good luck, anyway!

I do looks very promising a 100 pip move up to 1,0050 resistance

--- 帖子 #778 ---
good shout just on the 200sma I'm going in if we get the right close good luck mate.

Also GBP/CAD another 100 pipper in the making

Let me show you why I liked it there was a lot of chop but we had a fake out right at the top that cleared the highs of the range gives more of a bias to break the low of the range

Ok, i am going to short it.

Since i have one position open and not at BE, so i will wait. However i am looking for a short for this pair.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Why are you going to short it?

--- 帖子 #785 ---
the 66.65 is a big support, wait for this to be broken.

Of course, chance are still there, it would be reversed by the 66.65 support.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
agreed cheers for the post and it is going to get hairy but because of the fake out above to shake out the longs I'm hoping for a break of the range if not should still be in profit for a close at that level

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Buy USD/CAD at 0,9943 SL 0,9917 and TP 1,0050

Buy GBP/CAD at 1,5795 SL 1,5755 and TP 1,5890

Good luck everybody

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Took a short Monday open on the AUD/USD when it opened below the 10sma. 100+ pips up from yesterday. Moved S/L to + 50. Reaching support at 1.0615 which may be broken for further down trend.

Hi Guys,

Don't get too trigger happy, make sure that the ducks line up as per the BKG requirements for a valid signal.

I made 3 trades today:

1. NZDJPY, SELL 66.90, SL: 66.800, Open TP.

2. USDCAD, BUY 0.9954, SL 0.9819, TP 1.0050.

3. GPBCAD, BUY 1.5797, SL 1.5755, TP 1.5890.

Happy Trading.

Great trading everyone my trades this week

closed GBP/USD -29.6

closed EUR/JPY +1.6

AUD/USD currently +105

NZDUSD +127

USD/CAD +14

Moved stops to +50. I noticed you guys are trading some of the more exotic crosses I've stopped looking at them because of the erratic behaviour how are you finding them?

This is great thread good work everyone especially BKG

All the best.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
NZDJPY, MOVE SL +5 pips, free run

Last week I found BKG's this thread, 10sma is a good filter.

Actually, i liked BKG's trendline thread too, that one is also an awesome one.

I have three entreis trigged by 10sma cross so far, eurusd, usdchf, nzdjpy. All three are free run.

Combined with support/resistance, price action, trend, the 10sma would be a good trigger/filter.

This method is really simple, but not easy (I would assume this point).

Wish everybody good luck!

--- 帖子 #793 ---
I canceled my GBP/CAD trade -30

I follow BKG rules and look at almost everything I have. More exotic pairs mean bigger spread at least for me. It is allright I guess as long as signal is valid and there is 50+ return in horizon.

I also found that this amazing strategy works best in trending market not necessarly in ranging conditions am I right?

For example I took amazing trade on NZD/CHF two days ago and took about 200 pips in total. Ride it from res to sup however ma cross occurred almost in the middle of the trade and I made my decision to go short because of heavy res and specific candle formation.

Same thing in EUR/AUD from 1,2314 +118 atm and cross is coming about now.

Combine two and you have a winner.

This strategy is great and should not be changed imo, just follow basic rules, take care of your MM, look at RR and the system will do the rest.

I started in FX as a scalper and blew two accounts, overtrading big time. This tread changed everything in my aproach to trading.

And made me a better trader

Thank You

The Yen is having a good day against all currencies, looking good for entries to-morrow?

USDJPY is looking promising. Strong bearish candle under the 10sma. Buyers are currently rising the price a bit so lets see how it closes tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
cheers for the reply interesting thoughts, I do look at a couple or crosses EUR/JPY and EUR/GBP its just most the good traders I've heard about don't trade any crosses other than as they feel they move differently but I might start looking at a few for this method I was also looking at some metals and oil and index last night as well could also work I'll keep you posted.

I'm at +360 for my trades since Sunday at the moment so things are looking good, I like the USD/CAD trade as well as that had extra bias for me because of the inverse correlation between S&P and the S&P looked like it was ready for a drop which means we should see a shoot up in USD/CAD ... whammy

I like this strategy just wait for the good set ups then pounce like a sex panther. I was seeing how many anchorman quotes I could get in there did alright.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Yes mate two weeks ago I grab 650 pips. About crosses I would say look at the corelation table right here

try to avoid trades like buy USD/CHF and EUR/USD at the same time and everything should be fine

btw I am selling most aussie pairs atm

your link is wonderful... tq

for the past 5-6 days...

oz is weak

usd strong...

jpy is turning strong...

most times i observe usd, oz and jpy pairs...

then follow the trend to trade
my 2 cents

oz and nz move fast but

it is 4th day, oz/cad is crawling

cheers

The AUDCAD can be a slow one. And it is carry negative. However this trade is going your way so stick with it. Any profit - even from a slow burner,  is better than hitting your stoploss anytime

Hi All,

I'm amazed at how well everyone trades are going this week.

A big well done to everyone's analysis, persistence and willingness to share all their efforts with BKG's strategy.

I've analysed my charts for my trades and have now the following:

1.a NZDJPY, SELL 66.90, S/L 66.80, T/P 64.09, +92 pips

1.b NZDJPY, SELL 66.12, S/L 66.80, T/P 64.09, +14 pips

2. USDCAD, BUY 0.9954, S/L 0.9819, T/P 1.0045, +48 pips

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #803 ---

Can I ask where most people put their stops on this strat. at the moment mine are far too large I go above/below the daily bar or recent swing?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
2 places for mine

2 pips behind the offending candle (at least initially)

behind any support /resistance nearby

Hi Guys,

Looks like there is quite some resistance to be tested for the USDCAD trade coming up shortly.

1. Down trend resistance at around 1.0063

2. 200 SMA resistance at 1.0044

3. Resistance line at around 1.0049

I've moved my TP to just below 200SMA at 1.0040. Don't have time to monitor...sleep time!

Night all!

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #807 ---
I use S/R lines and trend lines as well.

I also use ATR(14) to monitor the volatility then decide to either use the S/R level or 2xATR, depending on the trade.

I do also move my stops in accordance with BKG's strategy, of BE+Spread when up 60-100 pips, depending on volatility and the trade.

Cheers,

Miike

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Yes, indeed, the trend is your very best friend using BKGs Day Chart w/10 SMA system.  THANK YOU BKG!

How do I load and submit a chart on this platform?  I entered AUD/JPY short at 86.65; it's now 85.26 bid.  Double WOW!

Congratulations on everyone's success this week.

Hey Don

http://www.forexticket.us/en/tools/01-01-correlation

Check the other pairs. This tool is pretty good.

Some traders make their own spreadsheets in exel to calculate corelation but why try harder when you have such a nice online service.

Correlation is huge between these two, usually move in the same direction but today as I look at my charts NZD/CHF heading north and AUD/CHF is a little bit confused.

Hi BKG102665,

Maybe for the followers can you post your currencypairs that you follow.

then everyone can make the right decession in the pairs.

regards

If bkg could do that it would be a good idea as it would cut out the trial and error at present if we had recommended pairs to follow.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
I will be glad to post the pairs I monitor but this set up should work the same on most pairs. I think I have 20 pairs I look at and will post them later tonight.

Hi BKG and friends, last night I entered a short trade in the EURJPY. It seemed to be a nice set up because it bounced at the 108.00 Resistance and the candle crossed below the SMA10 and SMA200.

Now my trade is against the market... I didn't saw anyone taking this trade in this thread, so I wonder if I made a mistake in my analisys. Did anyone entered this trade too??

Please can you see my chart and tell me if it wasn't a good set up? If I made a mistake, I want to know it and learn from it.

Thanks.

Greg.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Greg

I thought you have prepared to invest 170 pips when shorting this pair... with R:R 1:2?

At this moment you are running until exit.

In trading there is no full proof trading methods / systems incl. bkg. Prices go UP and DOWN in every second.

Hope the above helps.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Hello Greg, the pair you have chosen was not the ideal fit for this method. The 10 day moving average did close over the price..however, there is a considerable distance between the MA and the close of the price. Try to find the pairs where the stem of the bar is in contact with the MA. I believe the NZD pairs are good examples for the night. (AUD/NZD and EUR/NZD). BKG, if i have made a mistake in explaining this, feel free to let me know.

Cheers, FaRa.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
This is a good point. Also if it does close a long distance from the 10 SMA, wait for the pull back close to the SMA and there could be a possible reversal. This can be seen on the 8th of November. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
This is a good point and I think I read some other people fib the long candle and will wait for a retrace to the 50% level which is a good idea if you think there is a strong downward bias overall.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Looks like a nice 10ma setup is forming in the USDCAD, I'm already short this pair based on another method I trade, may add to the position depending on how the NY close looks.

Hello everybody

First of all i would like to thanks Bkg for his very interesting method and for taking so much time to answer all the questions he has received. i am short on USDJPY from 81.06 with SL 81.94 and TP 80.09. BKG, do you think is a valid entry ? and whoever want to tell, i will be glad to see your comments.

Many thanks !

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Welcome to this fantastic thread mate!

According to BKG rules you should wait for candle to close so the best time to enter your trade should be tokyo open when next candle come up on your chart.

This strategy gives you unique way of trading so you don't have to spend hours in front of your pc, just an hour a day

How cool is that?

Also I started to trading live since yesterday using this strategy, allready

+ 70

Good luck

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hi tomspin !

Thank you for you very quick answer and congratulation for the pips you earned !. i am sure this is a great strategy and very unstressed one.

I enter this trade yesterday night but it actually close under sma10 on 03/06, but i did wait for a better entry and did it 03/07 before closing time..so i guess i follow the rules (R not so far away+close under sma10)

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Oh well I must have misunderstood something , if it's going well then its alright.

In case of making entry I also look at the candle formation, imo very important aspect.

More people coming to this thread which is great it is not as busy as the other ones but it doesn't have to.

Just follow rules and you'll be fine. You are also more then welcome to post your charts and entry signals, let's share and earn those pips!

--- 帖子 #839 ---
nothing wrong with your entry however the price had already moved down too much. you should have waited for a retrace before entering or entered with half the position.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
In hindsight it is always easier to spot where a person might have gone wrong.

If you go back to the 19th of October there was at least 9 days from that time which had trouble with this level which maybe would have alerted you.

I find at times with the rush to get a trade on we are missing the obvious  There was 9 days that bounced of this level if those days were more spread out they would have been taken as an event area.

Only once after that time did we get a cross in that time with a large pullback.

I hope this helps you Greg for the future.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Great work Tom well done I hope to go live with this strategy soon few more weeks of demoing first, let us know how you are getting on

--- 帖子 #842 ---
There goes my winner. Now I DID NOT enter within rules and do not intend change anything. I made my decision because USD/CAD had been ranging more less since end of January and in ranging conditions I believe you look at sup & res + candle formations. I wrote about it few pages back, price was not far from 200SMA and at the res so I took my chances. Atm +87 trying to pull back after more than 100 pip drop.

I do believe this pair has a further drop ahead as you can see on weekly there is a lot of room + candle formation is interesting. We are in descending channel, bears "huging" bulls and a nice hammer. I would definitely take the trade tonight but that is my opinion and you should do your own homework

I am a newbie so constructive criticism is very welcome.

Good luck guys

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Hi guys,

Having read the last few postings, I'm just wondering whether someone, who has successfully used/tested this method, can tell the rest of us what the winning rate is? If it doesn't cause too much troubles, please attach few recent pictures from the winning trades plus comments. As in any trade there is nitty-gritty (detail), which makes one trader a winner from the rest even though they use the same method. Hope, you wouldn't mind to share the secret of your trade with the rest of us.

Your help and generosity are greatly appreciated....

Cheers... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/editor/smilie.gif

i am also watching this pair, and i guess it is a valid set-up, but i would no enter at this stage...it is on big suport right now and the SL is too far away (r/r is not good)...but it is my 2 cents advice, take it for that much !

thnks ,just looking at this method ,agree with you sure helps s/r and trend in mind

--- 帖子 #852 ---
This strategy is quite discretionary which is good and teached you to be a better trader so I think a win rate for 1 person would not mean a lot to the next you would have to just try it yourself.

Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #853 ---
It is an excellent result regardless of account size what I am learning more and more is don't think about the money just think about the pips and making consistent pips with a good win rate and controlled draw downs and the money will follow focus on the consistency.

Great work again though.

sniperfxmy, FaRa13, xTrammer, cmmichaels, whatfx and don555, Thank you very much for your comments. I don't want to challenge anyone, but I want to learn from my mistakes and I want to contribute something positive after all.. I know very well that prices sometimes do not progress as expected and can tranform a good set up in a bad trading. However, a bad trading can be a good opportunity to analyze what happened and learn from mistakes.

After reading your comments, I think there are some interesting things to discuss. I do not think the failure in my EURJPY trading has been a Sup/Res level that was not taken into account. The Sup/Res are somewhat subjective and dependent on trader's good eye. When I took the decision to enter the trade, the level you talk about was just an irrelevant support zone for me. Now, the market determined otherwise (hope you uderstand my poor english...)

On the other hand, I like the idea that the entry candle closed far below the SMA10 and this gives a sense of oversold market, which sounds logical to expect a price retracement. In addition, the distance between entry price and last Swing High (the rebound in Res 108.00) was very large and this makes us to use a bigger SL.

Now this idea is not one of BKG rules to trade with this strategy, so it is not validated. Honestly I would like to know BKG's opinion about it.

I love this Thread, and I love this strategy.

Greg.

The USD pairs worked perfectly with this model. EUR/USD, USD/CHF and also EUR/CAD. I have one question though for traders like myself who are interested in only trading day charts. I have had over 300 pips of profit wiped out this week simply because of these market pullbacks. I will place trades during the Asian market, find them over 50-60pips up, then all of a sudden during the NY session, its washed up, and either at a minimal gain or in red. Does anyone have advice on how to protect myself frrom this. I understand TP limits, but i feel like there will be occasions where i am losing out on profits because i will set my TP too low.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Hey Fara

I personally after +30 set my SL at my entry price so if my trade will turn against me, my position is protected. If you are unable to look at the charts trailing stop from 30 to 50 pips might be a good idea. Bkg has a nice way of doing things, He sets + 5 then leave his trade alone, I should do it as my USD/CAD pulled back on me after employment data spike up and hit my SL at + 60 and now came back down to further drop down.

I am pretty disappointed after work I have done with technicals I didn't include all the friday macro data from Canada and US.

But hey, you always learn something new every day in this business right?

Even if you are pure technical as this strategy you always have to know what is going on with macroeconomics and have a plan for it.

I have a question for you guys, do you add more positions on your way down or up after certain levels? or you simply make one trade and leave it alone till TP?

Thanks

Tom

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Or to be more precise is it better to add more positions in one pair or to open another i.e. correlated pair to double your profit?

Which way you would consider less risky and why?

Isn't it a 2nd chance on pull back down/up from 10MA... for EUR, GBP, NZ, AUD & CHF?

I wish it were the same on gold, silver & CAD... so that to show the "full" strength on USD... let's see.

I got one:  Short AUDNZD (just took the trade).

Pls see the attached chart

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Took a short on the AUD/USD today. 50 pips profit on that trade at the moment. Also took a short on the NZD/USD. 25 pips profit on that trade.

Reasons for trades:

AUD: Bearish engulfing candle on close of weekend. Opened below candle this week and also passed the recent low which gave further validation.

NZD: Strong correlation to the AUD. Breakout, pull-back set up last week. Opened below the candle this week.

--- 帖子 #870 ---

DO NOT JUMP on Aud/chf falling cat making his bounce atm very strong sup at 0,9627 if it goes trough it you may jump on train, there are extra  pips till 0,9558

I would wait with everything till Fed budget ballance.

I started trade explorer last night its free to see for everybody it is more less my live acc ugly twin sister and I make moves almost the same way.

I also wish to hear from Bkg were are you sir???

Good Luck everybody

--- 帖子 #875 ---
I would not, it is better and safer to wait till hit 1,2770 and grab a larger move up or down. Atm price is too far from res so better wait

Tom

--- 帖子 #876 ---
hi tom

u r from Poland... no wonder u trade many exotic pairs.

i see your daily chart and notice you have 2 candlesticks opened every Monday... starting with 1st one as circled being "one-hour" candlestick. this explains why you short oz/chf today after this "one-hour" candlestick closed under 10 sma.

cheers

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Spot on! as I said before res & sup + candle formations in ranging market is a winner. That's why I took CAD/CHF today. However I would strongly suggest to wait until daily candle close under 10 SMA and we are not far away from that moment.

I don't know like everybody else but I found EUR/USD pair as fair the hardest to trade maybe because of volatility ?

Tom

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Yup, as stated & posted before

--- 帖子 #879 ---
i believe bk is gone ..could not take all the off topic posters . what a shame ...he ask us to only post issues on the 10 sma system................

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Guys,

Lets get back on topic here...then maybe BKG will return.

Remember this is a system and thread dedicated to the BKG 10SMA method, so lets respect that!

I've attached 2 charts.

UCAD - Is ranging, may be a valid signal on the next daily close for a long.

UCHF - Is ranging and forming a head and shoulders pattern, if the resistance is held, will be a valid entry on the daily closing below the 10SMA off this resistance.

Haven't got time to analyse any others.

Cheers,

Miike

Hi

This is my first post and I am glad to chat with all of you. Forex Factory has been of great help for me in learning and trading forex.

On the 10 SMA close, Do we just look out for a candle close below/above 10 sma near support or resistance and also add 100 ema for direction? Is that all to it?

I also downloaded the support resistance indicator by BKG with those Aqua coloured lines. Are they daily support and resistance? Should we also try to find monthly and weekly support levels?

thanks BKG for a great system and once again I am happy to trade with all of you.

Hi

I also took a long position on March 8th daily chart on NZD JPY and got stopped out on the next day. The 10 sma candle closed bullish.

Can someone critique where I possibly went wrong? or if any additonal filters would have helped?

Hooray... He's back. Thanks bkg...

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Hi Forexnubie,

It is a bit hard to know exactly where your error is without seeing your chart.

From what I can see, the support was too strong for the NJ and so it reversed to test the resistance. Your entry after reversing the support was very high where the 10SMA occured due to volatility and a large candle on the reversal. Your entry was fine, but your SL needed to be much larger due to this.

I've attached a screenshot.

Hope this helps.

Hi BKG and Olu and Fellow traders,

Here is the chart of the NZDJPY trade I played on the daily chart. The Green arrow, third from the last. The trade totally went against and got stopped out.

Also on AUDCHF, looks like it reversed itself on both directions. Is there any reason I should not have taken the trades?

I appreciate your valuable criticism and looking forward to great learning.

Hi,

I found a close of 10sma on eurnzd chart today. It is a bit close to support/resistance. Is this a valid trade to take? If this trade to be avoided, what the reasons could be?

comments?

thanks

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Hi Forexnubie,

Had a quick look at your charts. As you can see in both your entries, they were made on very large volatile candles. These types of candles have a higher probability of retracement, hence your stopped out.

Keep an eye on the 200SMA for direction, trade with the trend

Also ensure that your entries are close to the s/r levels, this means you can have tighter stops. It's not a great entry if it is placed in the middle of the s/r levels.

Hi Forexnubie,

EN is currently ranging. I don't consider this to be a valid entry as your current open candle is testing support at 18jan candle and may test further support at 2mar candle. I would wait for a reversal from the support for a long position when the 10SMA cross and close occurs for the next move up.

My 2 cents

Cheers,

Miike

Hi Mike,

Thank you so much for your reply. I really appreciate it. Thanks a million.

So, you would not enter a sell trade due to earlier support in that zone and you would enter a buy instead, for the same reason, provided the candle closes bullish above the 10 sma.

thanks

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Mike,

Forgot to add the question to my previous post. Your Jan 18 candle jumping from support was a very good point.

How far do you look back for the support/resistance usually? 3 months, 6 months on daily charts? For example if there was a similar support last November, would you have not taken the trade for that reason?

thanks

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Hi Forexnubie,

Hard one to answer. S/R levels are subjective. I definitely look out for common patterns (such as head and shoulders) and strong levels where a large move has occurred as a result of the S/R.

Hopet his helps

does anyon have any stats to show which timeframe works best with this method ?

Hi WhatFx

I think the system was designed for daily charts and I have tried on both demo and real with micro lots and it works well. There are some losses also, but altogether I am in profit.

thanks

Hi,

It looks like the candle closed below the 10 sma on the Kiwi. Just like to know if this a valid signal, or if there is any reason not take the trade.

My idea is to enter on a SELL on 38 or 50% retrace of the long bearish candle. If anyone would avoid this trade, is there any reason?

thanks

--- 帖子 #902 ---
I will stick my neck out here this looks like a perfectly good trade I see no reason not to take it.

I have got a lot of confidence in it therefore I am taking it myself, if you wait for it to reverse you could even miss a good downward move.

Only my opinion.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Hi

Thank you very much for your feedback. I am also taking the trading without waiting for pullback. Looks like a good setup. But wanted to confirm.

thanks

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Hi guys,

I also took a short on NU. Definitely in a down trend now.

Stop loss at: .8174 and TP is open.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #905 ---
one must be careful of the 200 ma.  BKG has talked about  this.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Yeah definitely. However, if you look at the previous points where the NZD has went through the 200sma it hasn't acted as strong support/resistance.

At the moment, the NU is retracing back to the 10sma and continuing it's further drop. (fingers crossed)

--- 帖子 #907 ---
BKG if you dont mind me asking, you say you have a very busy work schedule... I was wondering arent you able to live off trading full time ?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hey everybody

First of all big thanks goes to Mr. BKG for his comments.

Last few days were so volatile there was no use for this strategy at least for me.

Watch this pair as I see a huge potential in next week from 1,3050 level

It really depends on further EUR/USD rally developments imo.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Just an update on this trade. Currently - 150pips. Didn't expect the retracement to be so strong

It's currently at the 50 fib line testing the level while also being near the recent high acting as resistance too. Still gonna ride this one out.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
tomspin

You already long this pair even thou the candlestick has not passed above 10 sma?

How do you get the lines drawn and separated 60/150/240/350?

Can you share the indicator?

--- 帖子 #911 ---
xTrammer

I noticed a few pin bars shown on H4 in USD pairs, maybe your pair would be fine at the week closing.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Hey mate

I just gave you guys a headsup for next week, this pair is correlated with eur/usd almost 80 % on daily and that is why I have closed it at BE point.

Eur/Usd has a terrible PA at the moment no sense of direction at all.

Just watch it as it has a huge bull potential and wait for 10 sma candle to be above sup and 10sma.

These lines are not indicator at all and numbers are round up just to show you were in case of the rally add more positions, You don't need indicators you should do your analysis and be able to drawn levels by yourself.

Hi,

I played the NZD USD SELL on March 14th daily chart on the SMA close. The price rocketed up.

Is there any technical reason that I overlooked while placing the trade. The support resistance was not really that close, i thought there is some pips there.

Any criticism is appreciated and I would like to learn the system better.

thanks

--- 帖子 #914 ---
forexnubie

You traded good based on the rules.

Unfortunately, many are caught unexpectedly since yesterday and so far today, or could be BE. This is live trading! Who knows where would the price go on Monday?

Trade well.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
This is something that actually bother me, I mean I wish to know how to mix tech with fundamental. I have noticed with time my skills in tech has improved, I am amazed how often I am right but still have problem with price kissing my SL or not enough confidence in my plan, I missed good 100 pips today on that EUR/CAD trade I posted before. I knew it will pop up but hesitated and cancel on BE point.Then Bamm!!! CPI  in US and the rest is just history now. Oh well still a lot of room out there and as I look at my chart monday open will be ready to buy. Also look at CAD/CHF I will post more of my ideas on sunday

Good weekend to all.

Hi

I took this trade along with you at the time it seemed a perfect trade.

Looking back in hindsight I have noticed in the 2hour timeframe that this trade had spent nearly half the day stuck and bouncing of this level 0.8069 prior to giving this signal which was the same entry level.

If we had watched it for a couple of hours we would have seen that a bar which I would describe as a type of pin bar fakey had formed The lesson to be learned here is do not  just dive in right away, take your time and weigh up the lower timeframes for the previous days history and if in doubt do not take it.

I have been caught with a few in the past couple of weeks by just going in blind but from now on I will be more vigilant.

I hope this info will help you in the future.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Hi,

did anyone got in this buy eurusd trade? its coming from support, it brook 10sma and its going up, is this entry correct?

--- 帖子 #918 ---
migmac

Perhaps you got it long at the lower time frame, not Daily?

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Looks like a valid entry point. According to bkg's rules of entry, it broke the 10sma, rebounded off support and also has room to move upwards.

I'll definitely be looking at this trade. Lets see how it opens next week.

I'm also looking at EURCAD. Rebounded off support and looking like a movement upwards. Looking at a smaller time frame, I noticed it's having trouble breaking through the 61.8 fib level. So i'm looking for an opening above that level before I will enter.

What are peoples thoughts on these trades?

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Hi,

Here are the setups I found on daily charts with the BKG 10 sma.

EURUSD - Bullish close, but a bit hesitant because of resistance at 1.3190

AUDCHF - Bearish close, No support Resistance close enough, may be a good one.

AUDCAD- Same

USDCHF - Bearish close, but USD dollar index, has been strengthening, may be Friday's weakness was a retracement. But no big support resistance close by.

EURAUD - ranging, and looks like the setups forms and it goes the opposite way.

EURNZD - Bearish close , looks like finished the retracement, may be a good price now, for a bearish bias.

Feel free to comment and disagree if you will avoid any pair due to any reason.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
In previous post, Aud Cad should have read Bullish.

thanks

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Most traders expect small pullback after friday rally 1,0460 would be perfect entry, 40 pips below current level, let's wait and see.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Thanks, Tomspin.

Any comments on other setups? anyone?

I think it is also a good idea to post the setup/ not so setup trades during beginning of the week, so that, we have time to analyze, set up charts, get other traders perspective.

And also on weekends, since the market has not started, we will have a lot of time to relax and trade for the coming week.

Any ideas, comments, welcome on the posted trade setups.

thanks

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Everything you have posted is sound imo, friday was really special and everybody is expecting we will go down a bit, I would short most CAD pairs.

If EUR/USD will continue her rally EUR/CAD and CAD/CHF are two biggest winners for me this week.

USD/CHF as well

Tom

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Hi,

Thank you Tomspin for your replies.

This is a good system, but I do not find frequent postings and not very much interactive.

Let us post more and share more ideas and make BKG proud!

Any comments on this week trades?

thanks

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Agree with everything you said, but this is daily strategy, you will not find this thread active like most threads on ff even if it's great. I couldn't find any valid set up today. We are simply playing "sitting on hands game" till Helicopter Ben on Wed 21st. His speech may give us a better sense of direction for rest of the month.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
I do not like this but frankly speaking 3 out of my recent found favorites threads, which offer "ease to understand + simple to trade" trading methods, unfortunately the authors left or getting inactive. You see when new comers come and join and soon find out the author has no longer active, they will also eventually if not immediate leave the thread. In fact i do drop by to study this system and inputs from you and others. Hope to see more posting. Keep up the good job.

You are right. More posting and updates will help traders with their trading.

Some forums, i can see there are many postings in a day. There are some forums that are very very active. I dont have a clue what happened here.

I can see that traders are not very interested in posting, commenting setups or they are all busy or  found a better system.

I wanted to make this very interactive and I posted so many setups on Sunday. No one replied, no comments, except from Tomspin.

An active forum keeps everyone updated. I will again post the setups I find again.

I would like to see such a simple system grow and the only way to do it by having a friendly interactive chatting and trade disussion on setups.

Once again, Thanks, BKG for a good System and traders, please let us make this more interactive.

Hi Don,

Thanks for the reply. I just want this forum to be active as any other forum because this is a good enough system.

There are forums in which there is a posting and response very frequently for example, every 30 min.

It looks like it will take days here to get a post or a reply.

I am happy atleast some one is responding so that we can show that this is a good viable system.

Can we post the setups and share ideas? We can make this more useful if all the traders keep posting and improvizing.

BKG, it will be great to get your reply.

thanks

Hi I have just noticed this as I went to my bed at 2am.

What was your reason for puting this one up I thought the point of this thread was to only take a trade that had crossed the 10 SMA.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Took a swing at a USDCHF short, close under the 10ma on 3/16 and behaving since..

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Once again I thought this thread was all about taking the trade on the day of the cross not 3days later.

Can someone enlighten me please regarding the rules.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Hi Don,

How do I respond to your "private message" privately to you?  I clearly cannot figure it out.  Sorry about the delayed response; now, you know why.

Judy

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Once the pair has closed under the 10ma, it's a valid trade w/i this system.  BKG has waited until a pair has retraced back to the the 10ma after closing above/below for better entry on many occasions.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Hi Judy click on Don555 member at the top left of the page it will then take you to a list on the left click on private messages and then scroll down to the bottom of the message and write your reply scroll down again and click on submit.

It is very similar to what we are doing here.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
I think it has crossed on my charts...I might be wrong

Olu

--- 帖子 #944 ---
This pair is crossing down after A bounce off old resistance. But it goes back to June of 2011. I'm not sure it is that safe.The 200 is flattish to up.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
The nzd/jpy has the same problem as the Aud/jpy. But at least the 200 sma is flat. I'm inclined to take the trade.

--- 帖子 #946 ---
I am in this pair since yesterday so let's see how it unfolds.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
I got in AUDJPY short yesterday as well at 87.834.  Placed a TP limit at 86.75 before going to sleep.  Today morning saw the aud had crashed and my TP was filled.  Now looking to re enter around 86.75 again

DD

--- 帖子 #948 ---
Sold again at 86.80.  Let's see how it goes.  Targeting another 100 pips but will be flexible.

Reason for taking this trade again is that the AUD is a bit weak.  And the market is exceptionally Short JPY against most currencies.  And we are approaching the month end.

May have some influence on the JPY on repatriation front to cover month end requirements in JPY

Fingers crossed

DD

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Stopped out early this morning for a 5 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
This pair looks ripe for a sell off a breakdown from an old resistance. But it would pay to use a pullback

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Moved the`stop loss when it went up 60 pips. Now stopped out for a 5 pip gain.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
prftablefool

which pair is this? do you have good results using stocastic and rsi on daily charts?

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Right

I wish to share with you guys a little bit of my analysis on EUR/USD and hope for some good discussion about it. EUR/USD moves most of the market and I think next week might be crusial in mid/long term sentiment. I believe EUR is going up big time. On H4 we can see clear H&S pattern suggesting bulls are about to be released. However on Daily chart there is bearish H&S(double) with right shoulder rejecting down move. Which one is more important from tech point of view ?

--- 帖子 #954 ---
UPDATE: I am still on this trade +140pips , this is one good trade that I am having with this system, but I would like to see the thread owner more active

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Thanks for posting, Tomspin.

It is good to post charts and setups and I dont understand why this thread is not so interactive. This is a very good system and I thank for the few traders who had been posting of late.

I can see many threads where they post every now and then.

And Where is BKG? BKG, come on, you cannot run away after inventing such a beautiful system.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
My advice would be to hold on and watch what will happen in 1,327xx 130xx area on monday. Look at the candle formations, well done to you mate

Btw BKG posted he is busy atm but he is still with us and read our posts

Hey folks!!! I have been out of town with little access to charts last few weeks. I saw this question and I have to respond.

I have a job that I very much enjoy. I look at trading as more of a hobby and something that hopefully may allow me to retire early or enjoy retirement more with the extra income. I have years left before I retire and have no real desire to retire at this point in my life. I truely enjoy my job and working.

Hi Bk

You are not too far ahead of me. I love most aspects of my job but some parts are tedious. Trading is more than a hobby to me though because I would like to start a Poor Man's Hedge Fund where the common man can have access to returns more than 1% per annum. This will still be based on long term trading. That's what I am about.

Hey BKG

I can see you are online, good to have you back. I have got a question for you. Do you ever consider macro data in your analysis? What do you do in ranging market with this strategy?

We hope for some charts and more hints about the system.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #967 ---
LOL I guess I do not consider macro data since I have no idea what it is! LOL!!

Hi BKG,

Nice to see you.

Now, if you can clarify a trade, it will be great.

I took AUDCAD BUY  because the candle closed bullish.  Somehow, the trade does not seem to go that way.

Is there any reason that you would have avoided the trade?

Anything else to look for before taking trades like this?

Comments and critique, please.

Once again, thank you for a great system.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
As you can see I took the trade also. My reasons for taking the trade

1)Closed above 10sma

2)Closed above 200sma

3)Closed above upward trendline

Trades do not always move as fast as we would like, be patient.

Often times it takes days for the currency pairs to resume momentum.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
If and only if the pair closes below the 10sma, 200sma, and my red trendline I will take this pair short. I will remain long on it until then.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
thank you very much for your reply, BKG.

So confidence boosting to get a reply from the person who invented it.

Thanks for the reply on AUDCAD.

Usually, For example, if the price closed above 10 sma, but in middle of daily trend line would you still take the trade?

What are the other parameters you would look to avoid a trade? Too close to resistance/support?

Anything else?

thanks

--- 帖子 #975 ---
HI BKG,

Thank you for the reply on AUDCAD.

How come your support resistance aqua lines are totally in  a different price range than mine even on the same daily chart?

Please help.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Hi guys, the AUDUSD is giving a buy signal:

- Price just crossed 10 MA from below

- Price bounced at Sup 1,0350 (aqua)

- Price bounced at 200 MA

But what I don't like of this setup is the short Trendline (grey) that can reject the price.

What do you think guys?

Greg.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Not to be a smart ass but I guess you put yours in a different place. Your lines from what I see are too close together. You will never be successful trading this if your s/r lines are that close. You have to look for major swings in price to make this work.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Hi BKG,

Thank you for your reply.

I did not draw those lines. These were the lines by the BKGSUPRES indicator. How the lines are different from the same indicator for same pair for same time frame? May be I am doing something wrong?

The lines with the Aqua colour posted on this forum. Please see attached. Is there a different version?

That is why I was asking how come it was different in yours.

Do you draw it yourself? If you draw them yourself, please share your way of doing it.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Read post #29 and #183

--- 帖子 #980 ---
The lines are placed on the chart by the indicator. You need to double click on the line and move it where you see s/r areas being. Once you have it in place double click the line again to keep it in its place. As s/r areas change you will need to move the lines. Most of the time my lines are anywhere frome 300 to 500 pips apart.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
I guess I have failed you guys by not being here lately so I am sorry for that. It does discourage me sometimes when I read the post and something I thought was so simple seems to be so hard for some to understand. I will try to do a better job of being here and answering questions.

You must know where s/r areas are. It always helps to understand candle patterns. Trendlines are nice to have on your chart. Most important is the 10sma.

All the other reasons I see on here for taking a trade or not taking a trade have nothing to do with this trading system. Stick to the very basics we have talked about here and learn on a demo account. Trading is not easy but one day if you keep practicing a light will come on in your head and you will GET IT!!

--- 帖子 #982 ---
I would ask that the people that are having a hard time with this do me a favor. Take these four pairs AUD/CAD, CHF/JPY, EUR/NZD, GBP/USD and put on your chart like I have done on my attached chart. I want you to take every trade that where price crosses the 10sma. You will start to see your own reasons for taking a trade or not. Concentrate on these four pair only. I am sure someone is asking "Why these four pair?". The only reason is none of them have the same currency  involved which gives you a better idea of how they all move differently. I think what happens a lot is if dollar gets weak everyone jumps on four USD trades and if the dollar reverses you find yourself with a big loss. Once in these trades are up 50 pips lock in s/l at +1.Lets see what happens!

--- 帖子 #983 ---
I start posting and everybody leaves!

Hi BKG,

Is that not funny? Everyone leaves when you start posting? hahaha

Nice to have your postings, increases our confidence levels.

Thanks for taking the initiative to post.

I just want this to be one of the active forums as we have a very good system.

By the way, coming to drawing support resistance lines, if we have to all draw it ourselves, what is the purpose of that indicator?

just curious.

Do you also draw minor and major sup/res levels?

If you can expand a bit on going about drawing sup/res, and explain how YOU do it,  may be it will be a good thing to follow, to keep conistency.

thanks

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Hey you buy me a round trip ticket to Australia and I will personally come show you how to draw the lines LOL!!

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Hi BKG and all,

I am new interacting to this thread, but not new following it. Bkg, you have a great system; I have a system of my own, and I have been following this one because as a trader you always have to keep learning and exploring other methods in order to expand your FX library LOL!

just wanted to say something:

COME ON you guys! you cannot be in the trading business if you do not know how to draw support or resistance lines, there is no specific method to draw them, you have to learn it your way! do some homework, don´t expect BK to do everything for you! Trust me, that if you learn how to do it, you will be more confident in trading, right now you are trading blindly regarding on a set of rules that you don´t even know why they are executed in that way!

I can tell you, this system relies on the basics of "supply and demand" of price, the 10sma just gives you the trigger to enter the trade.

Please take this comment as a constructive one, been in forex for 7 years and no system is easy and no system will give you $$ if you don´t understand it in the first place.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Good advice to follow those pairs it makes a lot of sense.

Personally it will help to unscramble my brain and stop me trying to second guess which way they will go.

I have been getting a few pips on retraces then missing the big moves when they turn around.

How silly is that.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
GREAT to see you back.i know it is troubling for .the traders read the last 2 pages then start posting and do not stay on this system .........i am having problems with s r. i may have to send you a ticket to houston ......ha

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Hi BrokerR

I think you assumed that I do not know how to draw support and resistance lines. That is a wrong assumption.

I have been trading for more than 2 years, not a lot, but not a newbie. I chose that name to respect all my fellow traders, their experiences are more than mine, and I am a newbie, comparitively.

I can tell you this much.

Traders draw support resistance differently, and wanted to know how BKG was doing it. That is all.

If you have posted something like what I did,  I would have never posted a disrespectful reply like you did.

thanks

--- 帖子 #991 ---
I always wanted to go to Houston! LOL

--- 帖子 #992 ---
oh common, dont get it too personal, it is not disrespectful, we are all here to learn, probably i misunderstood your post, i apologize to you for that...

--- 帖子 #993 ---
I do not think he meant you any disrespect. He had a very valid point though, you must place s/r lines where you think they need to be. I am not questioning your trading ability because I do not know you or your trading experience. When you put the indicator on the aud/cad trade did it look right to you? Where did you think they should have been? Never hesitate to question me because I make mistakes just like we all do.

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Hi

Thanks for the reply. It is okay. No apologies required. You people are good traders are we are here to learn.

Again, if you read my post, I did not draw those lines. If we had to redraw and adjust the lines manually, what was the purpose of that indicator?

thanks

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Forget the indicator and draw them manually. This was an indicator I use sometimes to alert me when price touches the s/r line. It has an email alert built in it to do that if you set it up that way but really not useful trading the 10sma.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Thanks BKG, for your reply.

So, that indicator was not even for trading with this system!

Ok, Now when you draw sup/res, how far you go? Just the recent ones? Minor Support levels also or only the big ones?

Do you use horizontal support lines only, or trend line support also?

If the price action closes under 10 sma and if it is near resistance, for example AUDCHF, at the same day, if AUDUSD did the opposite, say closing bullish on 10 sma near support, would you still take the trade on AUD CHF?

Would you avoid the trade if any other parameter is present?

thanks, BKG, for a nice system.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
You may want to go back through the entire thread and read past examples. I will say it one more time quickly.

At resistance take 10sma short trade

At support take 10sma long trade

Major s/r areas for me, you may trade this to your liking

Horizontal s/r lines

I do use trend lines sometimes also

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Ok, Thanks.

After all that, let me ask you, did you take the AUDCAD BULLISH trade? I got stopped out.

haha

thanks

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Yes and I am still in it. As I said yesterday I will probably stay in this trade unless it closes below 10sma, support line, trend line, and my 200sma.

Do as I say do, not as I do lol. I trade a little different sometimes based off past experience. That usually really bites me in the ass!!

--- 帖子 #1000 ---

I have set the SL and left TP open.

Hi BKG,

The post #994, that I posted has a flashing sign at the end. I do not know how it came there.

Usually things like this take up computer resources. I dont want to take up any resources by unintentionally adding any flashes. Please feel free to remove that post.

You have already answered my question, so I dont mind if that post is removed.

Hi BKG,

I got stopped out of AudCAD buy that we spoke previously.

How did you manage? I think you also took the trade.

Any reason that is obivious that I missed out on that trade on the bullish 10sma close?

I tried to reason it out and one reason may be AUDUSD did not follow it, and did the opposite. May be that would have been a reason for not to take the trade?

Should we look at correlated pairs also?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
I closed position @ 82,92 for nice 90 pips this is the only trade a made last night,

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
I also sold audusd, and closed with +63 pips but I know I had a late entry

this seems to be a very powerfull system, or maybe I just got luck on my initial trades my eurusd trade closed almost with +200 pips

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Congrats mate! System is powerfull indeed. I closed my position in almost perfect place, well 10 pips down would be better but still a very nice result.

AUD/JPY is pulling back atm as AUD/USD I'll be watching new candle tonight.

Still many stuff to learn I am trading both live and demo, live what seems to be clear and on demo what may cause some trouble. For example

If it stays at lets say 86,10 and new candle pop up, we are still acting within rules. We are under res and 10sma but we also have that 90 pip drop above our head which in case of another short position could be a very bad trade know what I am trying to say?

Or maybe I shouldn't closed my position and sit on my hands after all (just realised that)

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
There goes a question for you, Did you add any positions to your EUR/USD rally? If yes at what level? what was your strategy during that rally?

This may be a trade to think about but we will have to see where she closes tonight.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
First, great stuff.  You guys already know that.

Second, just a time question.

Is the D1 time frame set on GMT close/open or other TF?  (as in someones brokerage server TF)

Maybe I should just say what time compared to the GMT is the server closing the day we use as a guide?

Of course, you could just use your own brokerage server time, but that gives you fairly different returns.

Great trading to all,  Forest

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Good day everyone, and good deals. Thanks BKG for a good strategy. Sorry for my bad english. Question about EA Daily10SMA, who can  fix advisor so that he would open limit order at a price high/low previous day, but not at the closing price?

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
My daily server will click over to the new day in about 1 hour.

It appears the E.J will close under the SMA 10 + be off a major HL of resistence.

I do also see that it has retraced about 80 pips off the day low to its  current price which could be giving us a better entry price.  Current retrace is right at the 50% level for the day.

The other glitch I can see might be the proximity of the Weekly Pivot just a few point north of the current price.

Still, looks like a set up to short.

Do I have this about right?

Thanks for your input.

Hi,

Took CHFJPY sell on 10 sma close and hit the stop loss.

Anything wrong here? Any reasons that I should have avoided the trade?

This is the second loss after the AUD CAD buy I took earlier. Also took the AudCad buy after additional confirmation of the previous bullish hammer boucning from support.

Comments welcome on both CHFJPY AND AUDCAD.

Hey Forexnubie

Nothing special just news driven pullback, ate my 80 pips on EJ good I was BE+10

We cannot do nothing about news and there will be quite few this week, I cannot see clear signal tonight. I'll try gold on demo looks promising. Thursday signal was valid but then again came back. I'll be waiting until tuesday with currencies.

Good luck to all

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
I must admit, I am always anxious taking entry with the slope of the SMA 10 not in agreement with the direction I expect/want the trade to go.  This is frequently the case with the initial close of price over the SMA 10.

Of course, I understand with the BKG rules -- and hey, it's been working --there is no need to wait for the turn of the 10 line, and you will get in later by waiting, but it is often true that allowing the slope to turn around to your direction leads to success.  Just my thoughts.

Thanks to those of you posting your entry ideas.  I'm looking for solid entries.  I kind of like the A.J and A.U which drifted up over the weekend but still look like shorts which have now backed up to drop from the SMA 10 down sloping line.

Obvious problem:  both of these opened above the SMA 10 but are now below so probably need to wait a day and see where it goes.  Second problem:  price not coming off a point of major resistence/support.  Technically, there is no entry of course.

BKG and other forum old hands, any thoughts?

Forest

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Hello mate

I see where you are going with SMA slope thing. I had same doubts but still trying to follow the system. UJ looks like a valid signal but slope is pointing down. For me biggest problem is stop loss, I trade it live with small account so I cannot set SL with 100 pips like I did with demo, it is to much I believe if price turn back more than 30 the entry point was bad.

I thought about SL and have idea about it. If you have a small acc to begin with maybe it is good to enter with micro and set it large then if price goes in your fav add bigger lot at BE point???

If you guys use BKG's system and found solid SL criteria or maybe know when to expect pullback even if signal is sound please share with us.

Got to put my head down is 2AM in here

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Rest well, Tom.

I am certainly not urging anyone to do this, but one way to cut the size of the SL is to wait for the slope turn on the SMA 10 following a qualifying close across the line.

Not perfect, but may give you the confidence to go with a smaller, but adequate, SL.

I expect BKG with all his experience with this system would naturally say go for it as soon as you have a close across the 10, and this normally works, I think, because of taking entry down from major resistance or up from major support.  That plus a sufficient SL seems to usually be a winner.  And maybe there is a diagonal TL cross in there, too.  That's ideal.

Forest

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
I don't understand your problem with SL size.  You can adjust your position size up or down to accommodate the SL size needed for the trade and still keep you Risk % constant . Example: You have a $500 account and you are risking 1% per Trade-500 x 1% = 5$,  so you have $5 to risk on this trade and the appropriate place for the SL is appox. 200 pips  5/200 =.0250 , so your position size is .02 a pip and your SL is where is should be for this trade.  I am not talking down to anyone here, but just reading your post it didn't seem like you knew how to do this.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Hey Jay thanks for your reply

I do understand 1% and now thanks to you I understand I need to add some funds to my acc

Maybe I didn't explain everything, 200 pip SL imo mean at least 600 pip move until TP. 3:1 is a must for me or trade does not matter

Such a move happend only with JPY crosses recently, i.e. for Aussie it took almost a month to cover 400 pips from that res @ 1,0748

I know it is a mid/long term system and I am very happy about it, just trying to minimise risk and looking for better ways to enter the trade

I really appreciate your comments

Thanks again

Hi Forexnubie,

Here's something for you to check out

CHF/JPY

When you enter a trade - you should always make sure that you are entering on strength!

i.e. the trace on the timeframe below that which you are trading is in the same direction as your intended trade (your trading candle is formed by the 6 related 4hr candles)

AUD/CAD

A trend consisting of a number of rallies and retraces is best left to the more experienced trader, let him pick the bottom reversal.

Less experienced traders should trade in the direction of the trend, in this case shorts.

Hope this helps

Peter

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Hi Peter,

Thank you so much for your reply. I appreciate it and it is very useful.

Buying on strength is a good point. No one has explained it to me so well.

For example, if the 10 sma daily close is bullish and in smaller time frame like 4 hour, if 4 out of 6 candles are decisively bullish, then you call it buying into strength.

If those smaller time frame candles are all over, then, you hesitate and the signal is not so strong.

Am I right?

thanks, once again, and are there any other parameters you would avoid a trade if present?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Awesome! A simple trading system.

It is good for working men like me.

Care to share, how long you have traded 10SMA?

Thank you for your time.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Hi guys, I have the same problem with the SL size. For small accounts, there are 2 options I see:

a) Fit your size position to the Risk % that you can manage (what Jay have explained)

b) Trading the BKG system on a lower Time Frame. I have been trying it on 4H charts with good results. You can use half SL than the Daily ones,  but I have to warn you that there will be more failed trades.

Just my 2 cents.

Greg.

GBP/CAD less likely to do pullback(well I quess I see what I want) but more important has more pips in the way down

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Hi forexnubie,

1st let me say that I do not wish to distract from this very good thread (sorry bkg102665) - but to answer your questions....

If you understand Multiple timeframe analysis - then you have a good understanding as to the structure of the market, and will have a good idea of what to expect on your trading timeframe

Regarding your questions - On the close of the candle on the daily chart, this candle is formed by the open,close and the highest hi and the lowest lo of the last 6 candles on the 4 hr chart, all the other his and lows are filtered out.

"4 out of 6 candles bullish, then you call this buying into strength"

Not necessarily, if the last candle is a reversal candle, candles are showing weakness, or if candles are rolling over etc - this would not be a show of strength

I would suggest you visit Stephen Bigalows site, or buy his latest book on candlesticks - he is a trader, not a sales person - he tells it as it is warts and all, and no fluff

Regarding your other question on what parameters would suggest not taking a trade.....

You only make money when price is trending or if you enter at the start of a trend

So do not take a trade if the market is trading sideways i.e. consolidating (the ma will be flattish).

Any trade trade taken is likely to be limited by the support/resistance of the price consolidation, or most likely dip back thro the ma for a loss

etc, etc

This thread is really good

Your aim is not to change the system - but to try to figure out how to limit the number of "false" signals or weak signals

Every losing trade that you do not take - means that your profitable trades are yours and not used to replace the money lost on losers

Multiple timeframes are worth spending some time on to understand how the various timeframes affect each other

Personally I do not use the ma - I use another indicator setup based on momentum and volatility (not for discussion)

But this ma system is good AND its simple - stick with it

Good luck with your research

Peter

EURUSD will be giving a Sell Signal at the end of the day.

What I like:

- Break of short-term Trend Line (gray dotted TL)

- Sell in the direction of long-term Trend Line (aqua TL down)

- Bounce at previous week highs

What I don't like:

- There is not much room between price and mid-term Trend Line (aqua TL up). If the TL rejects the price, at least we will have the SL at BE.

What do you think guys??

Greg.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Hi Greg

It looks good but there are a couple of things that are going to make me pass on the trade,  your TL is one ,it doesn't  give me enough room to justify the risk (SL size) and trading that close into  a RN .3200 is the other.  Once beyond that, if it doesn't runaway, there are 150 pips of room until the next support point.  Im not saying don't take the trade , just sharing my view, and I am an ultra conservative trader. If it all doesn't line up I pass evertime.   BTW good job on your EURCAD trade

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Hi Jay, thanks for your comments! That was the purpose of the post: to exchange ideas and views.

I don't like this setup too, and the main reason is the proximity to the LT. Thats the reason why I explained there is not much space to achieve more than to move the SL to BE (sorry for my poor english).

However, I will be careful and aware of the evolution of price. If there is a sell signal during the NY session in a lower TF (1H or 4H), I will short this pair.

I have found that this system is not only good for trading Daily candles, but also can be used to analyze the big picture and set the stage to trade with lower TFs.

Greg.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Your English is fine Greg, and it looks like you are in on a good trade Looking at it from a different type of trading, the neck line of a H&S has a break  point where you TL is now with a target of 1.2650. So if the TL breaks I will probably join you

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
I am still holding AUD trades which are doing well so far.  The AUDJPY has done around 350 pips so far and it seems the pressure is still on.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Guys, what's your opinion/guidelines for trade management?

At what point would you go to BE? When R:R is 1:1?

Do you let the trade run until the 10sma is recrossed or do you pick S&R levels as the profit targets?

I like this method it is workable for me with my limited screen time. I am currently in the following trades:

GB/USD short 1.5888

EUR/ USD short 1.3201

AUD/ USD short 1.0276

USD/ CHF long 0.9124

All demo and I know that the first 3 are corrolated but I'm just getting used to spotting the entries etc.

My SL on all of them is about 100pips. At bit unscientific but it early days..

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
It's really up to the individual trader, I move the stops to breakeven when R:R is 1/2:1, thus I end up having a lot of breakeven trades.  For my winners, I currently aim for a 3:1 risk/reward.

Many traders would disagree; claiming that a trade needs more room to breathe.

Just my opinion (and trading method).

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
I don't know if you are still in these trades else you would have done very well as these setups are still working.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Hi, I exited all of them before NFP. Should have held on as easter meant volume was low and markets quiet. 3 out 4 were profit. The AUD trade was a small loss. Total was approx 240pips. Not a very good R:R though.

Now waiting for more entries. I need to work on better entries and smaller SL.

This is a good method as it suits my time contraints.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Hi Rob,

I live in Eastern time zone. I place the orders at the new candle which is 01 GMT or 8pm est on my platform IBFX. I think the big reason alot of people on this thread are having a hard time with this method is they are not maping out the support and resistance areas on their chart. An example is Tom,s trade two posts up (I mean no dis respect Tom just giving my view of the trade)on the AUDJPY. I looked at this trade also and passed immediatly because I had already mapped a resistance area 10 pips above entry plus its a counter trend trade, and thats exactly where price wicked thru and reversed. The crossing of the 10sma is just the starting point to analyze the chart to see if the trade makes sense to take from both a technical and money managment point of view. A good example of this is the last trade I posted, EURAUD. You can see on my charts all the S/R lines there, and my TP was just above one of those lines, and that is where price turned if you look at it today. Sorry i got long winded and this is not directed at you Rob ,just trying to help people if they are still not seeing the bigger picture.

Hello? anybody out here???

What a shame, BKG gave us the easyest way to trade, show us noobs how trading can be simple and profitable and nobody post here anymore.

There was a big hype about two months ago and at one point I felt like a bl@@dy spamer in here. Now I feel obligated at least to BKG to write few words.

Right lets get down to business.

Most people abandon this great thread because they couldn't get their head around something as simple as this system. I am still using it and found some nice conclusions about it.

I showed this system to few people on other forum (back in my country) as I wanted to find some answers I couldn't get here.

Same story, big hype, key questions without any kind of reply.

Only one guy was interested and smart enough to develop what surely was not said in here before.

He found almost "perfect" way to weed out fake signals and from his advice I came to conclusion about SL.

Which shouldn't be more than 40 pips, 30 would be "tight one" - yes I said it

When we can expect signal to be 90% valid???

When there is a clear breach of 10SMA from previous candle before our open just above/below SMA.

Go to your charts and have a look at previous entry points and there is the same succesfull pattern repeating all over again.

Always look for candles with nice full body, dojo pinbars may be more complicated to set SL @ 40 pips

Charts posted below, have a look

Thanks BKG I know you are busy man but when you have a moment, tell me what you think about it.

Like you, I too am grateful to BKG for this simple and successful system.

I have been following it from the very start and have been trading it too.

Somehow, I have not been able to utilise the Support and Resistance Indicator successfully (due to my poor skills in computer operations) so far which results in mediocre results due to some entries on fake signals.

However, I think, your suggestion of Stop Loss of 40 pips as well as use of RSI 7 indicator to confirm the entry signal will help me in my future trades.    Thank you for that.

Please do keep on posting whenever you can.

I have to apologise for my inability (currently) to post my trades.

Hopefully, I should be able to do so in the near future.

Thanks again to BKG as well as all other great Traders (like you) who have kept this thread alive.

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
You are searching in the right direction because VALID IS ALWAYS SIMPLE IN THE NATURE!

Complicated systems create complicated losses.

Don't think - SEE! The old Chinese Kung Fu masters observed the nature and animals to implement it in their styles. Observe the cycles coming and going. The whole universe is built on waves and the price action have to obey it also. You need only good pivot and ADR indicator to measure the waves. Use 13 SMA and if candle close below 13 SMA at buy trade close the trade, do the same but opposite at sell trade. Doesn't get simpler. Don't trade less than H1 TFs because 95% losers do, don't copy the crowd! That's it.

Cheers Hermes

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Have a look at the yellow area, these are the entry points and notice lower/higher shadow of the candles. In most cases price do not make a pullback more than 30pips/ish. Not a rule of thumb, just  my observation.

I don't use RSI as a confirmation, I have it for my daytrading and I only use BKG's rules, nothing else.

Don't use indy for supp&res, learn how to do it by yourself it is basic tool you have to know to trade forex.

Let us know how you are doing.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
pama.fx the is not too much to elaborate.

Just plot 13 SMA on chart and go with the wind. For exits I use often 5EMA, if crossed opposite direction on close candle - exit!

Thanks for the additional indicators.

Please bear with me and confirm if my understanding of your method is correct :

1.    Enter the Trade as per BKG's method.

2.    Use 13 SMA to weed out the fake or weak signals with minimal loss.

3.    Use 5 EMA to take profit and close the Trade.

I missed Geppy  such a nice signal, will be watching closely GBP/USD though, may be a nice sell signal today. Keep your Geppy going, I have a feeling it has more downward potential. Also EUR/GBP have crossed 10SMA today, lets see how it will end today.

That AJ trade hit my stop loss, hit ress pointed out by Jay and came back down.

I took USD/CAD last night but it is under water now about 35 points not the best pair to trade with this system(consolidation) and not the purest signal but I took it 35 pips I can loose as its my SL.

Good luck with your trade.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
I agree on GBPUSD, it should go down, but it might go up once more and them it might come all the way down

I have attach a screenshot of EURGBP, there is a resistance at 0.82216 , which is 36pips above the current price, not sure if it worths the risk maybe we should wait for the bounce on the resistance and get it whe it cross 10sma down

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Friend of mine the one I mentioned in previous post says if we are less then 50 pips from ress or supp we shouldn't take a trade. It will all depend on how todays candle end. I would take it if body would be nice and full with tiny shadow on top, and I "knew" EUR/GBP would go up today, there was a nice divergence on D1 yesterday so it may be beginning of the rally.

I'll keep my eye on it.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
An easy 125 pips in less than 1 day using BK's method. I broke the rule and didn't close when price reached the blue Resistance line(using candle closes as BK suggests) so I got 5 pips. I had plans to keep the trade on for several days till piptopia. Lesson: follow rules and close at Resistance.

Didn't know BK was back. I quit following this method when it went indicator and method changing crazy. BK, speak to us...

Steve

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
See Post 982; BK suggests using 4 pairs to expose us to each currency. Look at what has happened on chart:

Aud/cad: after price crossed the 10sma long it made 37 pips but did not hit my Resistance line so would be a loss of 120 pips if it closes in a few hours on the other side of the 10sma.

Eur/nzd: Discussed in previous post: +125 in less than 1 day

Chf/Jpy: 61 pips short in less than 1 day till support hit.

Gbp/usd: 370 pips in 9 days after price closed above the 10sma till it hit the closed candle resistance line.

Total: 436 pips

The only subjectivity required on these trades was the placement of the resistance and support lines.

I don't think this is luck but its too simple for most traders.

God bless you richly BK.

Steve

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
Thanks, Steve

Helpful reminder on pair exposure.  Also that results need to be 'averaged' over several pair over some reasonable time frame.

BKG's system does seem to hold up well on longer term examination . . . and you're not sitting in front of the screen for hours.  Pretty nice.

My trade for tonight

free picture hosting

Steve method has not changed one bit, I just found out with my friend how to limit risk even more, it is still daily chart, supp & ress and entry below/above 10SMA. This trade should prove my theory about SL as it should not breach back 10SMA. I too wish to hear from BKG especially about my bits,

Best of luck

Tomspin

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
what about support at 1.26207 area?

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
I wasn't worried about that level as it was 50 pips away, I woke up today and found I was stoped out, set SL about 5 pips to low, price moved back 35 pips and crossed SMA, so I was pretty d@mn close, oh well......

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
I did enter on this trade also, since I did agree with your analyse, my trade didin't close but I am still -21pips

I will updated you

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
Another way to enter trades that may keep you out of Trades like the audnzd trade is to BuyStop or Sellstop a few pips A/B the entry candle(depending on long/Short) rather than using a market order.  Nothing wrong with what your doing but you will end up giving back to the market more often if the market has no more momentum, especially if you are using a small stop.  I put an order on for the audnzd and audusd last night and stayed out of both. Just another tool for the tool box

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
Jay,

will you be so kind to tell what order levels (ep, sl and tp ) did you place for the audnzd ?

thank you

In long on the gbpaud and eur aud. entered after these retracements. Really no movement yet. Waiting waiting. SL is the trendline established after the new lows.

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Anyone still using this system?

I've been reading though the whole thread and it looks like this system would fit the way I want to trade.

It's very quite in the thread now, it that because it wasn't any good and you people moved on to other systems?

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
This system is good. As with most things folks over complicate. Read the author's posts and practice the method as he described.

Don't worry about the crowd.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
This is my first post on this thread and I have to apologise for my login name - scalping is what I used to do and I always seemed to be the one getting scalped!

I have been testing this strategy for the month of May on my demo account in it's "pure" form as it was introduced by BKG and it’s worked very well for me.

As I "evolved" and grew to understand this elegant strategy and I have tried to stay focused BKG’s critical areas to pay attention to; buy or sell based on Trend, S&R, 200sma and of course the 10sma. I'm looking forward to June and hope to go live soon.

Thank you BKG for this.

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Guys Pl. look at attached chart of last friday. Should I short it since it has gone down 10 sma??

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
I'd be interested to know also

Just for clarity here

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
Thank you very much!! There is not a perfect system out here anywhere. I have not posted lately because I got a little disquested at people trying to make it so dang complicated. Did anyone take the four pair I asked you to try months ago?....AUD/CAD, CHF/JPY, EUR/NZD, GBP/USD

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
If anyone did what I asked and took every trade that those four pair had produced since the middle of march you would have made well over 2000 pips.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
guys can you believe me I did NOT TAKE that Gbp/chf trade which chart I showed you! Otherwise I would be in profit for 200 pips!!

You Have to Believe in Yourself to suceed in anything! Lesson learnt for next time! LOL

Welcome back, bkg.  You were sorely missed.  It should be a requirement for anyone to read all of your comments from december 12th, 2011 through today before they ask question one on your thread.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
One of the best and profitable system I have seen. Thanks to you guys.

I have been trying out the system for weeks now, it's really good and so convenient. More power to your elbow bkg.

Love ya all!

Just a couple of trades I am in now. I hope you guys are all doing well!

Thanks beyond words.

Nice person, nice method!

Good pipping to all!

Hi bkg102665 ,

i really like your system and currently trading with a 4 digit broker and when i attache your bkg support and ressistant ea i m getting a little bit of large difference  numbers then a  5 digit broker. is this normal or can we fix this ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
BKG, re: trading A.Cd, Cf.J, E.N and G.U . . .

Have these become your four favorites . . . or are they added to other proven pairs for you?

Forest

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
BKG:

Good simple and clear cut method. Stuff of legends. Been lurking around and using your method and adapting it to how I trade.

And your Fantastic Four (AUDCAD, GBPUSD, EURNZD, CHFJPY).... out of this world.

In short, thank you for sharing your ideas.

Rgds.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
They are not my favorite pairs, they are just four pair that have no common currency. I was trying to prove a point that you do not want to load up on four pairs that have the usd, jpy, or any common currency. this way you get a much better result I think. If you are in eurusd, gbpusd, nzdusd, audusd and the dollar makes a drastic move it could be very harmful to your account. Spread your trades out over different pairs.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
I went long on EURSGD on Thursday 14th.

Wednesday's candle closed above SMA(10).

Secondly, I saw about 200 pips room up to resistance.

Price also closed above a trendline.

I'm currently down -78.

Should I've stayed out of this trade?

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
good advice for risk control.

btw. what ma is the yellow line?

Right.  High correlation kills.  Point well taken.

Candle closed above 10sma and at a previous support level. Possible TP at 200ma level. Entry at 50% retracement

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Hx

My concern would be that it couldn't get past the 200 for H4 recently and is in the area again.  I might like to see it clear that hurdle.

I also wonder if it has truly cleared the burden of the M-PP about 20 pips down.  Maybe.

Forest

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Hello bkg102665 and everyone!

I found this method very interesting and would like to give myself a try, but before I do, I have question,"Does the slope of the SMA10 matter? Do we have to wait until it's heading down to sell (and vice versa?)"

Thank you all... specially bkg102665 who not only invented such a simple method, but willing to share to the world as well. Salute!

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
I prefer the trades where the slope is clearly upwards (for longs) or downwards (for shorts). This shows resolution imho as the market has started to become set in the trend. Think about it. If the slope is flat it means price has gone nowhere for the last 10 days and it could go either way. Other technical aids outside this strategy would be required to help make up ones mind. An exception though is when the market has gone up strongly and I believe the trend is coming up to its end...

Olu

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Well said, Olu...

Thanks, I appreciate it!

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
What is M-PP

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
I think most of you will find this trade will work if you use it on four pair(do not load up on any one particular currency) and just take the freaking trade when it crosses. If you keep adding filters you will filter yourself out of some really great trades.

I really like this set up with currecies trading against the USD and JPY.

I have noticed that often the daily trend will change direction around the first of the month so just be aware of that. At least that is what I see but you guys may disagree with that.

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
BKG thanks again for this great training...i did what you sugested with the 4 currency and have made money . i am 77 yr old and have been trading for 10 yrs. won some and lost some.. but this daly system is the simplest and most profitable of them all..i live in the Houston Texas area..thanks to the daily syst allows for more fishing and golf...

Thanks, BKG!

I appreciate it.

BKG,

About this Fab Four, do they have to be AUD/CAD, CHF/JPY, EUR/NZD and GBP/USD as you suggested?!

Can they be AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/CHF and NZD/CAD?! Cause the main idea is trading 8 different currencies, right?!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
It can be any four to eight pairs that you choose.

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
Nice to see you back BKG...great system.

Just took a short on EUR this morning / Long on the JPY since yesterday.  Both have fresh moves across the 10ma and nice trends going

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
I don't know if this has been answered already as I,ve not been able to read all the post yet. I want to know if we have to give any regard to economic data with high impact

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
Thank you!  Took 3 trades and made a nice little profit!  Have been trading mostly intra-day with Bobokus' fib method and doing very nicely (thanks, Jeff).  But my circumstances have changed somewhat and I'm now unable to trade intra-day.  Tried several times but I just can't get a hang of Bobokus' method for the daily.  Searching for months before I stumbled onto this great system.  It is beautifully simple.  Just have to keep reminding myself to check S&R and not just cross above/below MA.   thanks for sharing this method.

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
I never look at news. If you are trading daily charts or larger I do not think news comes into play.News may change the trend but then you get in when the daily crosses and closes over the 10sma.Its really simple guys.

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
Hello,

I am new to the forum ... congratulations to everyone but especially to BKG.

What are the 4 best pairs for this system?

Thanks to all

There are not four best pair! Please read the forum. Good luck!!

Thanks so much I really have confidence in your trahding style. Could this be the HOLY GRAIL? To have survive a long period of years till now yet its still working............you can call it anything but I called it the holly grail I have been searching for..thanks so much BKG

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
BKG and Friends,

please tell me. Gbp/Jpy is above 10 sma today. Also Inside bar today High being 125.73, so I would go long at 125.75 My TP is at 126.63 90 pips atr. between high and low. Your opinion please.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
On page 1:

You're planning on taking a position long after the SMA cross..

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
did you notice ! I intend to play inside bar!!

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
inside bars is not bk system

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
That's the point, you're on the wrong thread.

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
The reason bkg left initially...

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
You should not take the trade now, it is too late. You should have taken the trade 13 days ago when the candle crossed and closed above the 10sma. Had you taken the trade at the correct time you would be up around 250 pips now and your s/l should be moved to +5, now the trade becomes a "No Loss" trade. Its really not that HARD!!

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Thanks BKG for your kind reply. Do you follow the theory of Daily Inside bar?/ Here we are talking about that Plus your 10 sma on daily chart.

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
Hi fellow traders,

Just found this thread, I'll join you guys. Thanks BKG, this might just be what I've been looking for.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
we have crossover on the g/u by my charts at least.

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
I must say I rather like the idea of this trading strategy. Simple rules and clean charts - and I will demo trade this until I get the hang of it.

So, on demo account until I am sure I fully understand the strategy I have entered:

Short AUD/CAD and Short NZD/USD.

Both trades the price had crossed and closed below the 10SMA and were not far away from 200SMA which to me signalled recent resistance.

S/L as BKG suggests to manage it.

Still learning this so would appreciate any comments ....

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
I dont have a close below the 10sma on the audcad. I am bearish this pair though. Can you post your chart?

I'll try - never posted a chart before - till now I have always been a lurker of the forums!

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
OK - attached is the AUDCAD chart

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
It all depends on which broker you use and what time of the day the candle closes whether it has closed below the 10sma or not. My IBFX candle has closed below 10sma but my FXDD chart has not yet. I am also short aud/cad.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Thanks for your post BKG

I have been a long time lurker on the FF forums and have been dipping my toes again into FX quite recently. Always looking to learn.  I must have the courage to post more charts and analysis and ask questions!

Ang

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
You are very much correct because on my MT4 by litefx(broker) price of both AUDCAD and NZDUSD has not closed below 10sma that will be by the end of today which means my entry will be by tomorrow if its closed below 10sma

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
You are correct. I am also short nzd/usd based off of my IBFX chart which has closed below the 10sma.

I am also short the euro/usa since last Thursday. I have just moved my SL down from the 200 pip mark and will move it to break even when I'm up 100 pips. (hopefully!) The only small change I have made to your great stratagy BKG is my SMA is 144 as I like the Fabonacci number.

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
just took a short on AUD/USD. I think I'm correct in taking this price has hit down trend line and will close below 10 sma. I know Im a little early on the demo account. Im at alpari UK.

Is this correct?

This is how my AUD/CAD chart looks like. I live in GMT +7 zone.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
BKG and friends,

About this different time zone we live in and where the broker located, would it be the disadvantage of this great system?!

The keywords "Closed above/below SMA10" would be relative according to where we and the broker are.

Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Some brokers vary what time of the day they close one candle and start a new one. If you and I both have an IBFX account our candles should look the same no matter where we live

--- 帖子 #1175 ---

Nothing is wrong with your broker. My FXDD candle did not close below the 10sma either. Relax and be patient.

Closed 50% of my short order on the Euro/USA earlier to day. I also brought my SL to break even. It's really nice to lock in a profit and be in a free trade for the balance.

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
Nice job!

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
Thanks for the encouragement BKG.  Taking some profit off the table felt odd as I wanted to “get it all”, I think that’s called greed and it’s certainly the feeling I had as I struggled to make the decision.  Once done, it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
I've drawn some s/r lines on my AUD/CAD chart and noticed that June 25th's candle did close below SMA10, but on top of support.

Therefore I think this short was invalidated. Any comments?

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
Took the plunge with NZD/USD.

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
I concur with your observation, however I took the trade down due to it breaking down a 2 week old UTL, it just bounced down from 200SMA and its on the verge of breaking my Demark trendline which if materialize, will send it down at least towards 1.0154.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Hey guys,

Looks Like the up trend may continue further….. & we have enough room to go long as we have 130 pips to reach the next resistance.

Regards,

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Not sure why you went long here based off of this forum but I hope it works out for you just the same

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
agreed.

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
Sorry, I should've added my reasons for going long on NZD/USD. These made me pull the trigger: Daily candle of the 26th closed above SMA10 as shown in picture. Two hundred pips to go until next resistance. Pair trending up on trend line.

I think I know what I've overlooked: the previous candles were all above the SMA10.

I had only briefly eyeballed June 25th's candle the other day and thought it closed below the SMA10. However this wasn't the case.

Was this the reason why this long was an invalid trade?

I've luckily just closed it at +4,5.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Thanks for the reasons!

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
I'll try to be more informative next time. The daily close coincides with my bedtime

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
Long AUD/JPY (bouncing off support, on upward trendline)

Short GBP/USD (on downward trendline)

Short GBP/AUD (bouncing off resistance, on downward trendline)

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
I tried your method BKG and I must say it is really stress-free trading...

I think for people having a full-time job as myself this daily system is one of the easiest and most profitable.

I entered some short trades this week when price closed below the 10sma or backed up closer to the 10sma...currently got a floating profit of almost +500 pips!

I am tempted to close some of the trades, but I will wait for price reaching nice TP zones like last swing high/lows, s/r zones or trendline touches. If I see a bullish daily candle close or a cross of the 10 sma in the other direction I will also be out.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge!

Olarion

PS: Swap is included for the calculation of the profit/pips, so gained pips without swap will be about +30 pips more.

A few closes below 10 ema tonight.

All very similar in that the candles closed just below support areas with 200sma close by.

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
These reversals suck. I hope you guys had stops in place. These days will happen and there is nothing we can do that does not mean I have to like them though. Next week being a holiday here in the U.S. could make for some crazy trading days so I will probably enjoy my vacation next week and leave the trading to someone else. I hope you guys have a great weekend!!

A/J currently at +100 stop to BE - should I get out? Hmm.. According to the rules I should've gotten out when June 28th's candle closed below SMA10..

G/U closed out at BE

G/A currently at +130 stop to BE, stalling at BRN 1,5300 - should I get out?

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
I can not ell you when to get out my friend. I have no idea what your tolerance for pain is lol. Lock in some profit and let them run. That way you have nothing to loose.

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
I may be totally wrong but I would lock in profit on these long plays early. I have a feeling this excitement for Europe will fade and you will see this head south again after a few days. I could be very wrong but that is my gut feeling.....

One "rude" question:

why do you have a job?

I'm in my job, and I want to do forex trading and if I found a way, I will not work anymore.......

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
I guess this question was directed toward me. I enjoy what I do plus this system is still is the early phase. I want a way to make money on a consistant basis when I get ready for retirement. This system is not perfect nor will it ever be but I keep trying to make it better.

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
Well, the Euro zone “optimism” pushed the Euro up and took out my stop which I had a couple of pips to the profit side. Overall results were 59 pips for a 5 day trade. A smart thing to have done would have been to close more of the original trade, say 70% knowing that news was coming. I left 50% open partly because I had was too focused on the Greek issues and not the bigger euro zone direction. BKG and fellow traders – any thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
I'm on page 25 and I think the simple system is quite good! I feel that when you reach the ability to place 1 lot, with about $50k or $100k; I think that's when you can retire!!

Let me catch up with the readings;

thanks

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
oh yeah! I was thinking of going with Oanda which is like using EST -4 or -5 GMT can't remember;

Was wondering if it will work. does the trades in fxdd work well?

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
how did this go!?

please share the secret!

btw, do you have the indicator for the arrows in the chart?

I tried to download in the first few post but the arrows didn't show up

do you have the source code too?

It's too close to the 200sma for me to be comfortable with it.

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
I would not consider going short on this pair unless I had a daily close below 122.70. Thats just my opinion, play it as you see it.

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
hmmm, if it close like the price now, we have like 100 pips to grab and run?

Nice thread and great to see a lack of swarms of indicators creeping in

I always have fractals and 200EMA as well as an RSI which may or may not run in the second window - mostly run it in the data window.

Big E on TMS had a method running for a while where he was taking entries on the cross and close above / below 5EMA shift 2.  Interesting to map the 10SMA and see that it smooths out the bumps in the 5EMA, so is a much smoother line - works really well.

I also found another approach on the RSI 21 and after playing around with RSI 10, I settled on running RSI 9 and 21 as a cross system.  The 9/21 cross looks pretty consistent with the close above / below the SMA10, so no real value add there.  It can work well as a heads up for spotting divergence with PA - not for every reversal, but can give an early warning on occasions.

I marked 4 examples on the GBP/JPY.

Not sure on the current SMA10 bull cross from yesterday - 200EMA currently seems to be too strong, so lots of Supply at this point.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
we dont care about bigE we only care about  MR. BKG OK ....Brit you know beter

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
The feeling is mutual - your lack of courtesy obviously speaks volumes.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
Hey people, I have been testing this system since the start of this thread. I can not deny that I have made a minimal modification (irrelevant) to adapt the system to my own style.

One of this changes is that I use the SMA10 system not only in Dailys charts, but also in 4H and 1H charts, and I have good results too!!! So, I ask you people, if you have had a similar experience. What do you think about?

BKG, again thanks. Please if you think this question is not appropiate for this thread, just tell me and I will erase it.

EUR/USD up 130, stop to BE

EUR/JPY up 90, stop to BE

(GBP/AUD short still running at +350)

If only these were live trades

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
Guys.......

Look at the setup below from NZD/USD, The strong support turned to be resistance now, followed by 3 inn-decision/dojis, And the bearish Divergence  says to JUMP INNN.............

We have everything that we need for a trade. but...... you never know how this animal will react....

so lets wait for the momentum/Cross of 10SMA for short.

or lets wait for the breakout for long.

God bless

Regards,

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
Hey guys

Here is another one with USD/JPY, it established a new uptrend from the beginning of June…… hope the trend will continue further…. Above 10 SMA is a positive sign + the price well settled with in the channel.

Looks pretty good for a long…. Huh….

Alright let’s wait for the price to break previous days high for a long…….

Or wait for the price to break the channel for short….

Regards,

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
Update

As expected It Moved down now +50 Pips from the low of yesterday ........ & below the SMA at the moment, so lets hope that it closes below 10SMA....

A wonderful Setup.... but i haven't entered the market due to lots of Red News around most of the pairs like "Non-Farm Employment Change" etc....

Still never too late...... lets keep this pair in mind & hope it gives us a pull back entry by beginning of the next week.

Good luck to all

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
Now This one moved against the expectation, i mean below the channel, however we can not consider this as the break of channel, Because.............

1.. It formed a clear uptrend from the beginning of June.....  so lets hope  that the trend continues.

2. Look at the 1H TF, it formed a triple bottom with the Bullish Engulfing pattern at the 3rd Reject.

Hope the price will get back to the channel by next week.....

So this is another pair to watch for next week....

SO ALL THAT we are looking for a roof to short or the floor for long......

Happy weekend to all.

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1246 ---

Price closed below SMA10 Price is close to resistance Price hasn't closed below upward trendline

This last bit is keeping me from entering.

Perhaps others may have different arguments for and against going short.

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
Hello,

Thanks BKG for the great system.

Here is my current long entry, based on closed above 10sma, perhaps end of a b c correction, and perhaps continuation of USD strength, meaning continuation of up trend line. Also, like the look the three blue soldiers.

B.

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
Thats a good catch,

look at the bigger picture(Weekly) shows the similar 123 with the morning star pattern formation(almost), however be Careful as the price is just 200Pips away from 200MA(one of the strong MA respected by price in any TF).

This is a probability business, we can not be successful until we try....... so keep going....

Good luck to you.

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Hi,

If you look at the trend on any pair, you will find that many times the price will swing around the 10SMA "can be on both Support or Resistance" areas. the swinging can also go to like 3-4 times in 1 week! which causes consecutive losses due to that. How are you guys filtering such scenarios?

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
You are right Hnijem, but then, I personaly don’t enter after the 10SMA cross….. instead I go down till the 15M TF, to look for the best entry after the 10 MA Cross on Daily Chart, this will avoid getting in to the trap( Daily/Weekly Swing)

Basically one should know the edge - floor to go long or the roof to go short.

Hope Mr,bkg agrees on this.

Good luck to all

Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
I hope you guys picked up some of these short trades :-))

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
It always helps to have trendlines, s/r lines, and a 200sma. If price is close to a trendline and a s/r line and it crosses inthe opposite direction then that is usually a good place to get in a trade. You can not filter out all the bad trades, you will have loosers!! I have attached a chart that is screaming "get in here"!! You have a blue s/r line, red trendline,yellow 200sma, and close below red 10sma.

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
Hi bkg

With you on most of them trades:-)

However on the AUD/JPY & AUD/USD I closed the trades for a loss as price closed back over the SMA.

1.Could you advise me why you kept these open

2. Both these pairs have crossed back below the SMA again tonight (10 pm UK time for me). If you get this situation where price moves back accross the SMA quickly would you place the trade again or stand aside. I'm not sure on this part of the method

Still on demo at moment and wont be using real money until I've got to grips with it completely.

Thanks for your help

Mark

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
I did get out of both those trades yesterday shortly after I posted. I was looking for a retrace back into the gray area on this first chart. I got it so I have now entered short on the aud/usd as you can see in the second chart. The aud/jpy chart looks very similar but I have not made a move on it yet.

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
I just took aud/jpy short also.

--- 帖子 #1258 ---
Hi bkg,

can you explain a bit why you closed both trades yesterday? Was it because of the almost full candle that signals a reversal/retracement?

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
Well I was long both pair due to a cross above the 10sma from the previous day. I woke up yesterday to see those two pair moving down so I took my loss, waited for a little pullback and then entered short.

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
I went short at the close of yesterday's big red candle.

Now I'm 80 pips in the hole, yet the upward move appears to stall at the trendline and resistance.

Is it logical to assume that price will bounce down again? In that case I'll stay in the trade.

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
This is what I see on the day charts - not a fan of H1

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
G/U closed above SMA10.

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
Position got over +50 (stop to BE), nearly reached resistance and finally hit my stop at +5.

On to the next trade!

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Price more or less at resistance with room below..

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
Due to time constraints (and poor trading....) I have been transitioning my trading to Daily charts only. I have been trying/testing several methods, and I really like this method.

Clean Charts, Price action based, and Simple!

Thanks for putting this together.

I took GU short this evening - looked like a good setup.

Great thread

I am not clear about what you consider daily candle.

NY 5pm? start of Asian

London 3pm?

What I like to know what time in a day when daily crosses 10sma you place your orders.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
Generally, new day is your brokers new day....

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
Still not clear about importance of time.

London open arguably is strong, NY and London until 12pm the strongest.

Say your 10sma crossed in 7pm Asian when there is no liquidity and come London you get screwed because you based your cross at the time when market was weakest.

There are guys only trade London open or NY but I have not come across brokers daily candle as base.

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
the daily close is typically measured by the NY session close; yes big players in asia and euro also use it.  with that being said...each session typically acts very differently; something very important to note and study if trading intraday.

the broker close isn't really relevant as I believe the poster above is referring to some of those MT4 brokers or something.  the market does not follow those brokers.

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Looks like this thread has been abandoned

Pity because this is a great setup.........

I have not read the thread completely, too busy, but from what I have read, some of us are taking trades where we have lots of S/R, traffic to the left on our charts, and over lapping candles - especially with long tails

We want to cut our losing trades to a minimum, and give our winning trades room to move so keep out keep out of the above situations!

Best place to take trades may be....

1   Breakout from congestion coinciding with ma signal

2   Trend reversal again coinciding with ma signal

As "they say", just take the A trades - much more easier on the emotions (even though we may miss the odd good trade)

For every losing trade, this has to be compensated for from profits of our winners

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Don't get caught up in the trade this session or that . You are trading a daily chart with daily stops, with a daily signal,  so it really doesn't matter about the session you are trading, does it?  You are trading from a set point down to the next or up to the next.  Looking at the time of day or night has no bearing on your success of the trade , but on how fast or slow you get there according to your argument ( momentum) if your signal is still a valid signal.  Take the trade you will be fine if it was a good signal.

Just wondering what the thought is on my setup.

I feel my S/R lines are perhaps weak or not well drawn. I went long on this one.

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
Hi ya Pama.fx, Fondofallthi..

I'm glad you wrote on here today as I wrote to Bkg yesterday asking about the system as the thread had seemed to have stopped and I was hoping to see some input from other traders as I had used another similar system with great results a few years ago except this one seems even a little simpler which I like

Just wondering how are you both doing with this system as it's very similar to what I was doing before with great results..are you both doing great with the system if so would you mind throwing up charts when ever you get a chance of trades you are about to take and why as I would really appreciate your views and thought process!

Cheers,

Adrian

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
Hey Fondo..

Going on what I've learnt so far(halfway through thread) it looks like your trading into a 200SMA also strong resistance area so this would be a more of a close below the 10SMA for an entry short I feel and a close above the 200 and S/R would be more preferable for a long..

Cheers,

Adrian

Took this Trade Yesterday, Hit my TP on my live account this morning but missed by a  pip on the demo.

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
Hey Jay..

Good to see you here ..

Just wondering if you took that short if so I notice your trading into a strong support and the 200ma wouldn't that be better as a long trade or am I missing something?

Cheers,

Adrian

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
Correct It was a short trade . I had mp TP placed above the 200 and at the Daily support area ( all the places you mentioned)  because this is where you are going to get a reaction to price, and on my live account I was 5 pips higher than these levels( and also higher than the demo pic that I posted) with my TP order so it finished out the trade when price tested the area.  With this type of trading I rarely swing for the fences, I usually trade up to or down to the next support or resistance area and get out of the full trade.  Hopefully I didn't make that more confusing

Take Care

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
Awesome!..thanks for explaining Jay, crystal clear!

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
Jay I was just wondering if you have been trading this system since you ended up in this thread and how has it been going for you?

The system seems very simple and I was thinking have you noticed this is a pretty powerful system as it picks up the reactions in price very quickly and also it has to take advantage of PA and S/R areas for it to function making it as close to a clean chart you could pretty well get with the added advantage of making use of PA and S/R areas, would you agree/disagree?

Cheers,

Adrian

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
I absolutely agree , If you are a conservative trader with a good understanding of Price and S/R levels you can easily bring you success up to the 80ish% .  The chop is what kills you that is why I am In and out on this system.  I have 10 + years behind me in reading charts so I am sure this helps a lot.  Just don't take big bites until you build up you experience and BKG's system will treat you right.

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
When you say don't take big bites do you actually stay in the trade till a cross and close above/below the 10SMA at times which in turn gives you larger pieces of the trade at times?

Have you been trading this on different TF's for your success or you predominantly stayed on the Dailies?

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
No I trade  to the next support or resistance level dependent on Long or Short and get out.  (Just my style, not trying to recreate the method) I only trade this on the Daily, I have a different method I use to trade W and M charts , same principle just no moving average, just levels.

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Thanks very much for your help Jay!

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
Hey guys and gals. Just my opinion but all the pairs I look at seem to be in a really tuff place now as far as trying to find direction. Do any of you see anything that looks interesting or tempting?

Hi Texan,

There's an old saying.....

In trading the 20/80 rule applies  i.e. 20% of your trades are responsible for 80% of your profits

Fact - All big moves will be caught by using bkg system!

So if you just trade a few pairs (the fewer the better)and take ALL the signals, you should catch all the big moves

The more pairs you trade, then you need to have luck on your side to catch the big moves (you have limited capital and cannot take all trades)

Peter

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
BK wrote on page 66 pst 982
http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon1.gif

I would ask that the people that are having a hard time with this do me a favor. Take these four pairs AUD/CAD, CHF/JPY, EUR/NZD, GBP/USD and put on your chart like I have done on my attached chart. I want you to take every trade that where price crosses the 10sma. You will start to see your own reasons for taking a trade or not. Concentrate on these four pair only. I am sure someone is asking "Why these four pair?". The only reason is none of them have the same currency involved which gives you a better idea of how they all move differently. I think what happens a lot is if dollar gets weak everyone jumps on four USD trades and if the dollar reverses you find yourself with a big loss. Once in these trades are up 50 pips lock in s/l at +1.Lets see what happens! ,,,,,I .nave named thes as the fab 4 . know he follows 20 pirs and i am sure he does well.but these changed my trading life.. and i have been trading for over 10 yrs,,,,,,,i want to expres my thanks to bk for this system thanks ,,,TEXAN

Texan -

Thanks for the heads up and I will give these a go on my practice acct.  I have a sell stop on the Z/$ and a buy stop of the lb/Y in my live acct.  My only concern is that I trade the NY session and the fab 4 might be more active before that so maybe I have to learn to stay up[ later!  Thanks again, p.

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
I am very glad I have been able to help you out. Can you give me(and the others here) some kind of idea of your results? Something simple like the number of pips made in the last several months or maybe what percentage your account has increased in the last few months, no specific $ amounts.

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
Hi

Just found this thread, will practice and see.

Hi Bkg,

Can I ask you (or others) to let me know what you think of my S/R line decisions here?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
They look fairly accurate to me.

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
Thanks Bkg,

I find your idea quite simple to follow, so I hope I can make good use of it.

I will post some trades as we go. Please feel to suggest improvements to my S/R lines

I will post one I found a little trickier. Just one for your perusal. If you think this one is okay, then I will confident enough to move on

Edit: Forgot to add that originally I had the Support line higher up (around the 1.0079 mark) but as the candles broke through I looked for the next logical support point.

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
My net trading yesterday wwas negative: -70 pips for the Z/$ & +32 pips for the gbp/Y.  Live trades but just micro lots and I now have a profile set up with the 4 suggested pairs on one screen.  I didn't trade today but will look hard at this strategy next week.  Have a nice weekend all, p.

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
I believe it was in this thread, but not 100% sure & I haven't gone back through it, where the originator ignores wicks & shadows but places s/r on the candle bodies.  If so you would be at TP in the above pic.  Good work.

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
Hi ya Fondo..

To make it easier for you to draw the S/R lines maybe change the chart to a line chart to help you mark up the areas a bit easier..

Also remember the S/R areas are zones a lot of the times, meaning not always to the pip with the levels and could easily have a zone range of 5-20pips at times..

Cheers,

Adrian

Dear Bkg102665,

I think "BKG_SuppRes41E.ex4" is an EA file not indicator.

I am not sure if anything wrong with my mt4,

2 auqa lines would not change day by day, I need to remove ex4 file and re-attached again.

If you could provide the ex4 source code,

it will be very helpful for modifying.

Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
From Fri I am short the chf/jpy and plus 91 pips at the moment. About 30 minutes ago I shorted the eur/nzd, minus 5 pips right now.  Both pairs are part of the practice four that  Texan & the originator suggested.

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
I have GBP/USD short at 1.6123 with daily tf.

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Why did you short the eurnzd? I thought price needed to be below the 10sma to be short

Olu

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
You are absolutely right, I didn't follow the rules.  The eur/nzd broke the 200 sma but not the 10ma which is indicating long at the moment.  For the chf/jpy I traded a bounce off the 200ma.  I will stick to the rules when posting future trades.  As far as that goes it appears the gbp/usd follows the rules although it has already racked up some pips and today is a light trading day.  I will just watch it and kick myself later wishing I had taken it.

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
Hi

The gbp/usd looks good for a short

Peter

--- 帖子 #1319 ---
I hear you piprac. I too consider the 200sma as a very serious sma to trade with. I just dont post those trades here. And you are right about the gbpusd you could have 'rac'ed up a lot of pips. Lets agree not kick ourselves too much

i use a 30 pip stop loss settings on  the swiss army to trail the price by the 30 pip sl. now if the price moves in my  favor 10 pips i only have a 20 pip exposer. the trade last night was the gpb/usd......... it has moved about 100.pips now i am locked in for 70 pip profit and has several hundred pips to hit  bk support. i do not take all trades unless the s/r is about 100 pips away.. the swiss army ea has lots of settngs and i will post my presets if any one wants. i do not over trade my acount.....i am 77 yrs old and i have been trading for 10 yrs i dont think most traders can keep up with 10/20 charts and make money i know i cant... you can put fibs and lines on your charts if yu think it helps..but most only looks good and dont help much about making money.please dont take offence just my trading thoughts STICK wirh bk and you will be ok.. excuse my bad typing and spelling...have a great day  /// Texan

Well done Texan

Texan - regarding age you have 2 1/2 yrs on me; regarding pips you have thousands of percent over mine.  I would love to test the Swiss army knife EA - does it go in "Experts" and then "Indicator"?  I don't use fibs, pivot points or anything like that but I do add Fractals because they help highlight possible S/R areas.  Kind of a visual short cut. Good trading. p.

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
swiss army v 1.51 only..this expert advisor is posted on many fourms. it it goes in your expert file. need to be put on chart that your not trading because yu should have bk ea on the pairs you are trading. then the sa ea will control all trades on your platform.

--- 帖子 #1324 ---
Thank you, I will fire up Google search.

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
I found the Swiss army EA, do you mind posting your presets?  Learning from the master.  I also wonder if you don't set a TP, just let the trade run until it retraces 30 pips.  Thanks for your help, p.

I wish i had noted where I got these instructions, hope I can help:

1. click "Attachment" at the top of Reply or Quote page;

2. click "Choose File" in the new window;

3. click "Upload";

4. click "Close" (or "Close the Window," not sure which)

I have not tried to load a chart myself as I really haven't much to either brag about or to cry over.  Good luck, p.

Texan -

I printed these instructions too but again forgot where or when -

1. Right click on chart then select "save as picture"

2. Click active chart..ok..then save somewhere such as pictures

3. Then in the reply to post area click on the paper clip next to the    smilies...browse computer to find picture then double click then upload.

Can't verify or attest to this one either but one of them should work.

I was 2 days late catching the downward move on this pair but early this morning I shorted @ 1.6040 and now have my SL @ 1.6020 so I have a free trade going and hoping for more.  Price is currently bouncing around 1.599xx.  The chf/jpy looks to close below the 10ma for a potential short trade but I have to wait 8 hours for the close to be sure and to set parameters.  A very nice strategy & preasure free.

Minnesota - and it is already getting cold here!

I haven't been able to get the swiss army indie loaded but I will try and puzzle it out and read more about it on forex-tsd.  May have question(s) for you tomorrow. p.

p.s. - we lived in Bellaire in 1950-51, my dad worked at a Zales Guild store, Corrigans.

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
I am jumping the gun by about 15 minutes but I have sold 2 mini lots of the chf/jpy with 1 lot having a TP @83.157 & the 2nd has a TP @ 81.592. Todays candle is fairly big so I made the SL for both trades half of the open to close distance. My gbp/usd is still open with +40 pips & I have 20 pips locked and hope it keeps going south.

edit: chf/jpy - both SLs hit @ 09:30 cdt.  I got my +20 pips for the gbp/usd when price retraced and hit my SL.  Net for 3 trades = -40 pips.  But just watch out for tonight forex!!

Hi

aud/usd is looking good for a buy if it can stay above the 10sma on its close

peter

--- 帖子 #1336 ---
Can you show some of your trades?

If you dont mind can I ask that you trade when price bounces from BK S/R and closes above or below 10SMA? You put 30 pip Sl with open TP if S/R is more than 100 pips? If trade move 30 pips in profit you move your stop to BE right? Then keep trailing with 30 pips right? Please explain if I am wrong.

Thanks

Yes, I built a long position on AUD/USD today.

Hi guys  --

I hope this might encourage some discussion.

I am tired of bleeding from my lower TF trades and this seems far the best of the D1 threads.  Hearty congratulations, and thanks, to BKG for this effort.

As I have read much of the forum now just one issue is concerning me -- entries against the slope of the 10.  Yes, obviously, they often work, but it seems about equal time they do not.

In my back testing the win ratio is solidly higher by avoiding any entry until the 10 has at least gone flat and seems to be turning toward the entry direction.

My hunch is that BKG and others would say this is why we put the 200, SR and TLs on the chart.  They tip us off if it is a quality entry, and I agree but just don't yet have enough experience here.

I would love to hear your thoughts.  Am  I being too cautious by waiting for the 10 to flatten and turn toward the entry?

Good trading to all,  Forest

--- 帖子 #1339 ---
Early signs... Comments please?

Olu

--- 帖子 #1340 ---
Morning, Texan!

Best to you.

Your comment seems to say you take a position with an initial stop of (only?) 30 pips?  That's quite a bit tighter than BKG and some others.

I understand why you might want to trail your best price by 30, still tight though, but I am wondering about you INITIAL SL.

Did I understand this correctly?

Thanks, Forest

--- 帖子 #1341 ---
Hello there; I was just wondering if anyone is still using this system? Thanks BK for this system..If anyone would care to respond, what kind of money management system are you using? Since there is no stop loss or real take profit, how do you calculate the number of lots or micro lots for this system? Thanks again for a very simple and direct system..I realize that at 100 pips, you put a SL at +5, or at 50 pips, +1, but if anyone would care to reply, thankyou in advance..

--- 帖子 #1342 ---
Hi Rokz and fellow traders.  I need your help.  Rokz I really like your simple order managemeny EA but for some reason it won't close half the order (0.10) when the order hits +30 pips.  It is moving the SL to BE +5 which is great.  I'm sure im doing something dumb here ?

--- 帖子 #1343 ---
I still use the system. I must admit though sometimes my stop is less that 100pips. This is only if the 10sma is nearer current price action than 100pips so I tuck the stop behind the 10sma. As per number of lots to trade this is the same with any other system. Find out what 3% of your account and set your trade size so that if you lose 100pips it would not be mor than that 3%

Olu

--- 帖子 #1344 ---
Thankyou OLU appreciate ...

--- 帖子 #1345 ---
Hello Olu and justreality --

Like Olu, I continue to use the BKG 10 sma system.

The one adjustment I prefer to make is to wait for the slope of the 10 line to at least flatten to neutral or turn even slightly to the direction on price.  It is not unusual for the price candle to close across the 10, lets say up, while the 10 line still points down.

Often this is just an early entry and it works fine.  However, I do find you can increase you win rate and/or avoid a temporary draw down by waiting for the 10 to turn toward price.  Of course, this may also limit some gains.

Just my way.  Certainly not arguing this for everyone.

And Olu is braver than me with his 3% per trade limit.  I usually won't go past 2%.  HOWEVER, you must remember that if the long term expected value of any trade on this system is positive (it is!) then allowing more reasonable risk is sound.  It doesn't mean the next trade will succeed but that over time your acct will grow much faster using his 3%.

You will trade well with this system.

Forest

Thanks everyone for your responses, really appreciate them....Now what about the exit strategies...I have read the posts but in my opinion, I personally like the +1 at 50 pips..I then also follow the 10 Sma with the trend each day and set the SL accordingly until I get stopped out..This way if the world blows up, I still have some locked it pips...LOL...I use the FAB 4 and understand now the reasoning behind the theory that was set by BK...Any thoughts on the exit strategy..and again thanks in advance..

TEXAN,

In the above post  " use bk support and res expert edvisor "  what is bk ? and is that an support and resistance expert advisor ?, if its a support and resistance expert advisor, can you please provide me with that expert advisor or indicator and if possible can you also post the swiss army expert advisor . ( I know its a lot to ask, but it will be really helpful if u can provide those expert advisors )

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
Hey fxscalp, this may be a silly question but are the orders your trying to close larger than 0.1? Or are you meant to be closing orders in the 0.01 range?

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
Hi Rokz, first of all that wasn’t a silly question - I wasn’tclear on what I was trying to do! I use a 0.2 of a lot as my initial orderwith, in this case a SL 0f 70, I would like to have my BE moved to +5pips whenmy order is +30 pips and have the ea close half the order (0.1) at the +30 pipprofit. I have noticed that the ea will automatically place the SL but I don’tsee a TP line. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong...........

--- 帖子 #1353 ---
Sounded a simple trading method?

Anyone is still trading with it?

--- 帖子 #1354 ---
am just following this system with simplicity on my demo account.l enter based on the previous candle colour,trading the trend.l enter 10mns before the the new opens,but l make sure l check simple basic info like not buying at the resistance  and selling at the demand,so far l make more than 300 pips a day and my stop loss is 50pps.my higgest is 1000 pips in one day,am going live with this system soon.l have been trading for a year so its not a mistake making these pips and this is real stress free trading.l enter all 21 pairs at once.my losses are cancelled by my wins

Sounds like you may have a pretty good handle on this .... However your trade explorer record does not reflect this......

--- 帖子 #1356 ---
Just checking in guys! I am still alive and trading :-)

--- 帖子 #1357 ---
I would like to apologize for being away for so long but work has had me extremely busy and I had to back away from trading for a while. I have added a live trade explorer and you will be able to track most of my trades and progress. Thank you for stopping by and I hope I can help you become a better trader!!

May go short on the eur/usd when the next candle opens based off what I see here on the 4 hour chart.

A couple of trades I am in with s/l already in place so they will be a small winner regardless of what happens.

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
Here are a couple more trades I am in. Because JPY will do more QE in there future I will hold the AUD/JPY trade for a while, long term trade. Not sure how the EUR/USD will work out but feel good about it at this point.

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
To anyone that may be reading this I can not express enough the importance of always having a stop loss in place. There are always things going on in this world or speeches being made that we are unaware of. These things can greatly impact the forex market and change things very quickly. Do not allow yourself to wake up one morning and find yourself down in a trade 400 or 500 pips!! Always have a stop loss!!

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
I am out of eur/usd trade with a few pips. I will stay in the aud/jpy trade but there is a lot of Aussie news tonight that is high impact. I have my stop loss set and may get kicked out. If I do I will look at it again tomorrow.

Please feel free to post ,ask questions, and become active in this thread. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
I did get knocked out of aud/jpy trade with a small profit. I will look at it tomorrow and see if there is a trade after tonights high impact announcement by AUD.

I am now in no trades. Stop loss got me on all of them

Election day here in the USA. No trading today for me.

--- 帖子 #1367 ---
I did jump in a couple of trades yesterday once it seemed the elections may be headed toward a win for most republicans. Stop loss are in place so they will be winners regardless of the movement today. Take profit has not been set. I will just keep a check on it and take it out when the time seems right.

--- 帖子 #1368 ---
Not sure anyone is still hanging around this thread but just wanting to get it revived. The trade still works and I am always trying to figure out how to make it better and more reliable. If you are interested in trading along with me on this very simple system please reply back and let me know there is still some interest here. Thanks and trade well!!

--- 帖子 #1369 ---
These days I really only trade five pairs: usd/jpy, eur/jpy, eur/usd, gbp/jpy, and gbp/usd. This system will work on most any pair but seems to work better with the pairs that have a more consistent trend. If you try this on a volatile pair you will not see as much success.

--- 帖子 #1370 ---
I got out of a GBP/USD short trade last night due to it being close to an all time low. This is just my opinion but I would certainly not be looking to short GBP/USD here. I will be looking for a signal to take it back long and that may take a while to set up, BE PATIENT! Please be reminded all my comments are based off of what I see on the daily charts.

EUR/USD is sitting at a resistance area as well as a daily trend line area that started on December 1, 2015 so it may be going back long also, only time will tell!

--- 帖子 #1371 ---
I decided to go long on the eur/usd.

--- 帖子 #1372 ---
The 10SMA is still my favorite trade working off support and resistance areas and now I have added a MACD to try and help me make better decisions. I would really like to get this thread back going again say please jump on board and subscribe to the thread and post your trades. I will be posting my trades and look forward to discussing them with you!

These are trades I am currently in so let us see how they work out and please ask any questions you may have as I am here to help fellow traders if possible. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #1373 ---
Hi

I'm really impressed you are still running this thread for around 10 years using basically the same method.

Yes, you added few extra MAs and oscillators but basically it's the same strategy.

You should be an authority about the use of MAs and the old problem of them being lagging indicators.

so, how did you overcome their lagging nature?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1374 ---
I can't say I am an authority in ma's but I do like the 10sma as a guide to where the market might be going. If I see price go below the 10sma at resistance area or above 10sma at support are I am probably going to take the trade. As you can see by my charts I now use MACD to try and help me see a potential trade developing. Notice how on a potential cross below the 10sma the histogram bars go below the red line that puts me in a trade. If price goes below the 10sma but the histogram bars are above the red line on my MACD I will not take the trade.

Notice the blue area on this chart.It will show you what I am talking about.

--- 帖子 #1375 ---
Yes I see

you have 10SMA on the chart. what's the second MA setting?

I'm going to replicate your chart

--- 帖子 #1376 ---
I have a 10sma and a 40sma on my charts.

--- 帖子 #1377 ---
Can someone please advise me as to how to change my default page to this forum page? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1378 ---
Please have a look at this setup

--- 帖子 #1379 ---
Yes that was a perfect set up to go short. Please notice there is a false 10sma cross 10 days earlier. You will get bad reads so always have a stop loss in place and know where your support and resistance areas are for better decision making.

--- 帖子 #1380 ---
I pulled the trigger on this eur/usd trade yesterday so we will see how it progresses! Did anyone else take any trades based on the 10sma?

--- 帖子 #1381 ---
Happy New Year all! Let's do some awesome trading in 2022!

--- 帖子 #1382 ---
This trade is not wanting to cooperate with my way of thinking. The trade has a pretty tight stop loss on it so I will let it run. It will probably get taken out especially with USA Fed minutes coming out tomorrow. I will stay out of any trades at this point until after the fed minutes tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #1383 ---
Good morning everyone. I believe I will sit on my hands until the Fed minutes are released at 2 p.m. today. I believe price will pop down and then head back up for the next few days. We will see how it plays out.........stay tuned!

What are your thoughts or concerns?

--- 帖子 #1384 ---
BKG, great to see you back on your forum!   I humbly think the adding of the MACD is an excellent addition.  Things are still pretty straightforward but with a very useful second piece of information (filter).

I hope your return may help those like me who check in occasionally to get back on-board with the 10 SMA.  It is a net winning system.

--- 帖子 #1385 ---
Good morning and glad to see you hanging around here. Please subscribe to the thread and add information and ask questions!

--- 帖子 #1386 ---
It has certainly been an up and down morning! Don't let the market movement scare you out of a trade as long as what got you in the trade is still in place. I like trading the daily candles because it takes all the up and downs of the day out of play. I will only enter a trade on the close of a daily candle and will only get out based what a daily candle tells me. If  I am in a short and my daily candles continues to close below the 10sma and the histogram is still in the negative I will ride it until my tp area.

I love the idea of keeping things simple in trading AND using the daily chart for seeing potential trading opportunities so thanks very much for sharing your system ....  I also like finding trade opportunities from the daily chart and I have found that the Waddah Attar Explosion indicator to be quite useful for confirming trade signals ... Im not sure if peopel want to try it in this system but I thought Id share this here just in case :-)

Take a look at the GCd. (Monday trading day)  I would say it is at or very near a confirmed short.  I would be a bit happier if the SMA 10 line was more clearly turned down, but . ..

After 2 days here's a updated chart for GBPCAD . Divergence of Price VS Rsi 14 comes into play. I'm not trying to hi-jack this thread but 10 day sma is too slow for my taste. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1395 ---
I always recommend trading what you see, not what I see. If the 10sma is too slow for you this may not be the right thread for you. I see this going back up based off what i see.

--- 帖子 #1396 ---
RSI 14 and price divergence is the key. Look at any chart and you see RSI 14 and price divergence you can count on odds that price if fixing to change direction. And don't hate the messenger. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1397 ---
Hey brother I hope it goes your way. I am not in the trade because it is not a pair I normally look at. We all have things we like to see to get us in a trade, if RSI14 is your baby then ride it!
