NEWEST UPDATE 8/13/09 This method has been reworked and is best understood here http://www.forexfactory.com/t/102967...-system-1.html UPDATED on 9-20-08 The “set and forget pivot net” system I have been trading forex for about a year now and I found that ‘picking bottoms or tops’ is my sure-fire method of making my broker money. The less I tinker in the market the better I do. I DO USE STOP LOSSES. I have had plenty of the no Stop Loss kool-aid and it tasted good for a while, but eventually the poison killed my account. Unless you have a huge account or are willing to trade where 1 pip = $0.01 then it’s not worth your time. You can make money doing it, but it will take a long time and you’ll have plenty of sweating to do. On to my system (I’ll leave my opinions to my blog). UPDATE! This is a set and forget system. Used on 2 pairs. EU, GU. It uses one of the few predictive indicators the Pivot Point. The system has been updated to only use two recommended pairs. EU and GU. The system used to include GJ, EJ and UJ, but after 7 months of forward testing I have concluded that the risk involved with the other three pairs outweighs their potential profits. At 00:00 EST/23:00 CST (my time) / 4:00 GMT calculate the daily PP. I use Oanda and that is when they begin a new daily candlestick. Oanda also has a function where you can easily add the daily PPs. Though for some reason the S1and R1 is usually 1-2 pips further out from the actual PP and the S2 and R2 are 2-3 pips further. I cannot figure out why. So if you know please let me know, but so far I’ve used their PPs and they have always worked. Cancel all orders by 11:00 EST the following day. Usually orders triggered with one hour to go in the London/US market overlap do not have much movement. Calculate the distance between R1 and R2 and then multiply the distance by .667. For example if the distance between R1 and R2 is 50 pips then the multiplied distance would be 33.3. So you have R2-R1=X Then X*.667=Y X=TP and Y=SL This works the same way for S1 and S2. The set ups are on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening. The reason for this is Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night have the best movement. I have found that trading on Sunday, Monday and Friday for this system provides poor results. Calculate what percentage of your account you wish to risk (I recommend no more than 1-2%) and divide that by the SL. That will tell you how much each pip should be worth. It will also provide an outcome of Risk:Reward of 1:1.5 (in a perfect world without spreads it would be 1:1.5 but tends to actually come out as 1:1.30-1.45) Update: 1) I will leave both orders open for any given pair until 11:00 EST. There are times when the market will give you TWO TPs, TWO SLs and sometimes both a SL and TP. In the end they balance out and this is after all a Set and Forget system. I really do try to forget it until it's time to check again. 2) If an order has been triggered and is still live after the London market closing AND the current price is halfway to the TP I would then move my SL to break even. The way you decide to set these up are ONLY if the previous day’s closed candle movement is less than the previous weeks daily movement average. (Do not count Sunday in the weekly average)The reason I leave out Sunday is I have found it is usually a corrective day or has very small movement which makes for very small PPs on Monday and they are just not very accurate. One more tweaking detail. I add 2 pips to the spread to each entry and exit position. But I leave the SL at the same spot. It saves me the frustration of those days when the price action tags the S1 or R1 and fully retreats. Here is my formula: R2-R1=X X*.667=Y R1 + 2 pips = BUY R2 – 2 pips = TP Y – R1= SL Money Management Y=1-2% of account All formulas are the opposite when using S1 and S2. Below is a screenshot of this trading system. The previous day’s movement from HH to LL was 112.2 and the previous week’s average was 137.9. Therefor the previous night’s only valid signal was for EU. I set a Sell signal at 1.46652 with a SL of 1.46952 and a TP at 1.46272. I also set a BUY signal at 1.47823 which was on another account. Pictured below. It was obviously not triggered. The TP was at 1.48494 and the SL was at 1.47329 I hope this helps some people. I scoured the internet looking for set and forget systems and found one that I made myself to work just as well or better than most. It’s all price action and uses one of the very few predictive indicators. The old school Pivot Point. Since this is the first system I have shared I’m sure there are some details I have left out, but I will do my best to make This is my thanks to everyone on this forum and all the information I have learned here at FF. -blueace-

Hi blueace thanks for sharing, i think i understand the system, but i just have a couple of questions. 1 Lets say that the buy order was triggered do you cancel the sell order or do you let it run till 11 est? (im guessing you let it run but i just want to make sure) 2 I understand that you cancel pending orders at 11 est, but if you have an open position do you close it , or do you wait for it to hit your sl / tp. Again thanks for sharing, i love the set and forget style of trading, its just hard to find something that actually works.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hey nick 1 Lets say that the buy order was triggered do you cancel the sell order or do you let it run till 11 est? (im guessing you let it run but i just want to make sure) You're right I let both trades run until 11EST. There have been times when both are taken out with a SL and both are TPed. I've found it's easier to just let them run. They balance themselves out in the long run with having both triggered. 2 I understand that you cancel pending orders at 11 est, but if you have an open position do you close it , or do you wait for it to hit your sl / tp. If an order is triggered I let it run until it either hits the TP or the SL. The only time I close one of the trades is if it is stil alive once it's time to set up another trade. One more tip I forgot to add. If the Price Action has moved more than halfway to the TP and the 11 EST has passed I will move the SL up to breakeven for a free trade. Again thanks for sharing, i love the set and forget style of trading, its just hard to find something that actually works.[/quote] I have found a few Set and Forget systems that I really like and have taken the stress out of trading for me. The link in my signature has the links to them. Best of luck to you!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for the trading strategy and the links. I will give a look to both.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for clearing that up Blueace, i think i will start demoing this next week, along with the weekly breakout ive been testing (another set and forget).

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I saw one trade with this last night. Long USD/JPY It's still open - 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Actually I only had one trade opened for last night which was GBP/USD and it did not trigger by 10:00 CST. The reason I did not trade UJ yesterday was because using last weeks M-F Trading rage with Oanda's feed gave me an average daily range of 101.8 and yesterday's UJ moved 102.6. Therefore it was invalid. I know this seems like splitting hairs. But I have learned I should look for reasons not to trade. This week has been slow with this system and I had one trade on Monday night with EU which was a win. FYI I did set up the GU trade because last weeks average was 168.1 and yesterday's movement was only 143. Hope that helped.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
So far there are only 3 possible pairs available to trade tonight. EU GJ EJ The reason is because they have not yet violated last weeks daily average. EJ is getting close at 147.1, I have last weeks average as 150.1. I realize that if you use MT4 the +2 GMT plays havoc on figuring these numbers. That's why I'm here to help. Last weeks averages as I see them are: EU - 137.9 GU - 168.1 GJ - 179 EJ - 150.1 UJ - 101.8 As I mentioned before I have been using this system for a while and it is one that can be backtested pretty easily. The pairs I use are the most consistent. You will find that you will have success from time to time with any other pairs, but these preform the best.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
My broker's data showed last week's average to be 102.2 pips. Yesterday's range was about a pip less than that.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I have noticed that Oanda's pip range is usually a pip or two further than most brokers. Meaning a little higher and a little lower. But as I mentioned I look for a reason not to trade. So it might be a good addition to the system to void a trade it it comes within 5 pips to play it safe since all brokers have slightly different numbers.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Bluelace, and thanks for introducing your system. I love set and forget systems, and especially systems that are based on mathematical equations. Here's the inevitable question that will be asked, so I'll be the first. What has been your results? It appears you've been trading this live. Do you have a history for each pair?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
BlueLACE?? haha... here are the results for the past month starting with week 7/28 Keep in mind I don't count pips but rather wins vs losses. All results are shown as though I risked 1% for a reward of 1.5% (This obviously only works with a set amount for the account balance or rather a set 1% risk. I figure this number at the beginning of each month and for round numbers sake I realize that while taking at least 4 pips from the reward side my R:R isn't perfectly 1:1.5 but more like 1:1.4.) For sanity sake I have rounded up. Forgive me. EU (4.5 wins 2 Losses) +6.75% -2% = +4.75% GU (6 wins 2 Losses) +9% -2% = +7% GJ (2 wins 4 Losses) +3% -4% = -1% EJ (3 wins 0 Losses) = 4.5% UJ (3.5 wins 2 Losses) +5.25% -2% = 3.25% This gives a total of 18.5% for the past month.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
another interesting set and forget system... i love set and forget system, thx for share it can't wait to test forward it

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Interesting strategy. Just a couple of thoughts.. Technically, daily pivots should be calculated based upon the 24-hr session that closes at 17:00 ET / 21:00 GMT. Using that setup could strengthen your results. Also, with such straightforward order rules, your system can backtested relatively easily. I would caution trusting the results of a single month's performance, or even a year's performance. I would see how a 5-10 year backtest performs. Good luck with your system!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Actually I have 8 months of backtesting results which were forward tested at the time. I'll post them soon enough. But I did backtest for 2 years previous. I just don't have those results to post as I did those manually on paper. As I mentioned before the Pivots from Oanda have worked stellar for this system that's how I discovered it in the first place.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
blueace, thanks for posting. about how long have you been trading this particular strategy?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
My pleasure to post it. Been trading it for 8 months. I started to come up with it when I noticed the correlation between a below average daily movement (usually the market waiting for news) and how the market would blow through the S1 or R1 and make it to S2 and R2. So I did the math backwards to create the correct R:R of 1:1.5 I searched for a long time to see if this was an original system because I thought it was too simple for someone not to have noticed before. I never found one like it. I felt compelled to share it. I know that it has worked for me and I wanted to see if I could help others out. Being in this time zone it makes it difficult to trade the London open. So I lean toward Set and Forget systems.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
The only Pair that qualified for a set up tonight was EU. The Daily range was 126.2 and last weeks average was 137.9. For argument's sake I am going to post my numbers. I implore you to only DEMO these numbers if you use them at all. Here are the Pivots I am using R2 - 1.48773 R1 - 1.48347 S1- 1.47076 S2 - 1.46232 Therefore my set ups are: Long: 1.48367 SL: 1.48063 TP: 1.48753 Short: 1.47056 SL: 1.47639 TP: 1.46252 Fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #19 ---
How do you calculate last week average? And what indicator can i use for daily PPs in MT4?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
blueace, your strategy makes sense as a whole and that is not so often the case for strategies we see on the forum. The points that I like are: - wait for a day with a lower range as usually consolidations will be followed by bigger movements - avoid the extreme days, Mondays because usually it doen't move much and Fridays because they are the days usually with the big releases - take action on the sense of the move above / below pivot - low leverage I have not tested your strategy but I will most probably do it as it makes sense. The only thing that I didnt get from your original post was the time zone, you said "At 00:00 EST/23:00 CST (my time) / 14:00 GMT", EST is GMT-5 and CST is GMT-6 so I guess it is not 14:00 GMT but more 05:00 GMT

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Eastern time is GMT -4 during the Summer. I think he meant 4:00 GMT rather than 14:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I take the HH and the LL of the pair at 00:00 EST/4:00 GMT for the days M-F. I do not use Sunday's movement as it tends to be a market correction day or a low volatility day. It is very in consistent therefore I leave it out of the weekly average. As far as MT4 goes I'm not the one to help you. I do most of my calculations by hand. I have MT4 open on a separate computer but I mainly use Oanda 's platform for what I need on this system.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks for pointing out my mistake. 4:00 GMT is correct. I was thinking of the time when the order is no longer valid. I will correct the time on the first post.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thank you. I was striving to find a logical and simple formula for a system. It seems sometimes in trading the obvious answers are staring us in the face and we complicate it for no reason. Here is a picture of what lead me in this direction. I noticed that very simply these PPs caused the market to react. I know they don't match up perfectly with PPs if calculated at 5 PM EST, but nevertheless they worked. Oanda's platform makes it easy to add the automatically calculated PPs.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Blueace, What about taking the last 5 days movement average instead of prior week movement average? This way you will be considering prior days activities (like a moving average). Think about it. G

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Using a rolling 5 day average might have something to it. It's worth backtesting at the least. For a while I had added the rules that if the previous day had touched either the S1 or the R1 then the next day was void, as well as the current day must be an IB. These rules, while strict, provided a very high percentage winning rate. But as you might guess also kept me out of many trades. In the long run using the correct R:R and the basic signal from the previous weekly average the outcome was a greater % earned.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
The big flaw in this system is slippage on the "real" market. If you are waiting for a big breakout, especially after a news event, your stop orders will be slipped and possibly filling you at the worst possible price. I note that the OP uses Oanda. Oanda does not slip your orders but they raise spread to 20+ pips on GBPUSD around news time. Please comment.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
slippage and inflated spreads are a threat to any system. this system, while it waits for breakouts, is usually covered by the market continuing well past the S2 or R2. Therefore the large spreads do not become much of a factor. As a matter of fact I have never been stopped out by an unnatural spread trading this method. The large spread is usually back to normal size by the time it hits the TP. or it even hits my TP with Oandas stupid huge spreads at times. lucky me you are right slippage isn't something that I have to worry about with Oanda. but I would imagine even a poor fill would be overcome by the market carrying on in the direction of the trade. or as far as a stop goes isn't that something you have to worry about at all times when using a non-market maker? This system isn't geared toward trading the news. just the fact that if there wasn't much movement the day prior; it lends itself to greater movement the following day. There are plenty of moves past the S1 and R1 that don't require major news to fuel them. this is just a glorified straddle system that takes advantage of the market recognizing PP supports and resistances.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Blueace did your short e/u get triggered. My 10 am candle had a low of 1.4706, S1 was at 1.4707, because of spread on my platform (2 pips) i think it would have missed on mine. But im not sure, sometimes i get confused with the spread. Thanks again for taking the time to post.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hey Nick, No my EU did not get triggered. It was close though. That is why I give a few pips of breathing room away from the S1 and R1. As you can see from today and as I have witnessed in the past anything triggered after 10 AM usually does not perform well. This is not a hard and fast rule. But more often than not it will just flounder around the S1 or R1. So that does not give a great showing for my system this week with only one valid set up. But that one set up was a success. E/U on tuesday for 38 pips or 1.5% depending on your MM.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thats right i forgot about the 2 pip rule. "So that does not give a great showing for my system this week with only one valid set up. But that one set up was a success." Actually I think that was a great start, staying out of the market is one of the most important parts of trading imo. Im looking forward to testing this next week.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
one more confirmation blueace. As S1 and R1 are not symmetrical to the pivot but S2 and R2 are, it means that SL and TP distances are different for Buy and Sell orders. So according to the MM rules you have different lot sizes for the Buy order and the Sell order, correct?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
you are absolutely correct. I figure out how many pips the TP is first. Then multiply by .667 to get my SL. Then divide my SL number of Pips by my 1% I am willing to risk and it tells me how much each pip should be worth. And they are very rarely the same on a pair due to the S1 and R1 distances being different. Thanks for highlighting that for me.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thks for sharing yr system. I don't understand the statement you made above. How do you use daily range and last weeks avg to decide if a trade qualify? thks

--- 帖子 #35 ---
To determine the previous weeks daily average I take M-F ending at 00:00 EST HH minus the LL for each day and determine last weeks daily average. Then at 00:00 of the current week I see how much the pair moved for that day and compare it to last weeks 'daily average'. If it is smaller then it is a go for trading. If the pair moved more than an average day last week then you don't place a trade. Hope that clears it up.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
blueace, how do you get the pivot points to show up as you do on oanda? when i apply them they look like bolinger bands. thanks.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
yeah the ones that you add via 'add study' are extremely UNuseful. They make a mess and look like cave drawings due to all the very sharp lines. My nice neat clean ones are provided via the 'draw trendline' tab. As pictured below.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I like the system and wish I'd thought of it since - now that I think of it - it's really true that big moves follow days with narrower trading range, and like you say, they seem to be waiting for news. Were you "bottom picking" in pairs with the Pound first? Am familliar with the bad-trades-at-either-end thing. Time to login to a new demo. Unfortunately, my PP's, S's &amp; R's don't correspond to yours in the least. On Aug. 28th (I'm in Europe) my figures were different. The formula I have is: R2= P+(H-C) = P+(R1-S1) R1= (PX2)-L P= (H+L+C) /3 S1= (PX2)-H S2= P-(H-L) = P-(R1-S1) This corresponds to the pip with my ###AutoPivot Indicator for MetaTrader 4. Tried to find a way to make entrances &amp; TP's corresponding to yours using these S &amp; R figures to no avail. Cannot figure out the numerical relation: my version vs. your version. Unfortunately ###AutoPivot Indicator is not adjustable as to formula to calculate. Have looked all through MetaQuotes Library for another indicator but except for ###AutoPivot they all have undesirable display quirks. So will have to calculate by hand.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
yup we all know what you get when you try to 'pick bottoms'...a sticky finger. You're right to use a standard PP calculation. I'm just using 04:00 GMT. As my day's end and beginning. This system might be completely valid using other ending times. My broker just uses 04:00 GMT to start new daily bars so that was how I noticed it. I would be interested to know if the system is valid on a standard 21 GMT daily bar PPs. Unfortunately without being able to adjust the indicator to different open/closing that means a lot of PP calculations by hand. Especially for backtesting. It does not seem like it would be too complicated to have an indicator written that would figure out the PPs based on a day ending at 04:00 GMT and leaving them on the chart in a way that I have them on mine (see pic in attachements). I'm just not the guy to do it. I can't write code. So anyone that's an MT4 programmer...hint hint?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Brucewhain, and any one who might be interested, i found this pivot indicator for MT4 which allows you to enter a gmt shift. I cant remember where i got it but you can mess with it, might be what your looking for. I found that when your on the hour that the pivot is set for you have to either go to a 5 or a 15 min chart and wait for the first candle to close in that hour for the pivots to register, or wait for the next hourly candle to close. Otherwise you will be reading the previous days pivots. Any way that's what i got out of it, but i might be missing something, let me know what you guys find.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks for the pivot. But I have a question as How am I to preset the GMT shift for gmt 4:00 as my pivot line ? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
That depends on what platform you are using, and what time zone they use. I use ibfx and i set it to 4, but i might be wrong it might be 5. The daylight savings confuses me sometimes. My pivots were the same as blueace's, within a pip when i used the 4 setting. What platform are you using?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi @ll, I've just gone thru my indicator collection. Just found something nice to share on daily pivot indicator with R1,R2,R3 &amp; S1,S2,S3. Hope it does good for everyone here. Just make sure to set the Starting hour to 4, as I'm using IBFX.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks. But I got something nicer for all ...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Blue@ce, Thanks for sharing such simple system. I've just digested your method, perhaps, I can perform a forward test and see the result.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Nice indicator, great for back testing, just wish it displayed pivot levels on the right. thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I wish to, however I'm just a techie. Not good in C development. Perhaps someone can assist, as the source I've also attached. Thanks to a thread which I've downloaded it about half year ago. Luckily I still keep the indicator in my thumbdrive....

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks for your help guys. I'm still tinkering with the ST-Pivot Points indicator as I like how it leaves the past PPs on the chart for quick visual backtesting. I'm just using MT4 demo with Alpari ticks to run it on and it looks like setting it to 4 GMT is pretty accurate. I'll have to compare the numbers with Oanda 's PPs more to know for sure though. thanks again so much for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
For those of you using the Oanda provided PPs. I wanted to let you know that I set the PPs using the daily chart view then go to the 1 hour view to get an accurate # reading to add my formula to. Thanks TheHenryFam for bringing that to my attention.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Blu3@c3, No sweat, as long as the methods work for everyone. I like to systems, hope it does for me. But I think I gotto test on my FXCM platform. sometimes, the spread is quite high during prime time and also evaluate which platform better for this nice set and forget system.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi, Blueace hows it going. Looks like the only possible trades for tonight are the e/u and u/j. Did I miss any others, and will you be taking these.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
right on time Nick...I was busy working on this post when you wrote. Yes you are right about EU and UJ. Here are my daily averages based on last weeks movement. EU 135.2 GU 172.8 GJ 194.8 EJ 158.1 UJ 101.1 The only two pairs that qualify for tonight are EU (110.7) and UJ (96.1). EU buy: 1.46426 SL: 1.45945 TP: 1.47077 sell: 1.45264 SL: 1.45567 TP: 1.44879 UJ buy: 108.766 SL: 108.455 TP: 109.143 sell: 107.751 SL: 108.167 TP: 107.218

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi, Blueace thanks for the reply, Im going to take those trades on a micro and see how they go.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thank for input. Let me preset on demo for testing. Rush out today...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Blueace, Probably a stupid question but as they say there are no stupid questions. Could you please list the days (dates) you use for the calculations. Meaning "tonight's", "previous day", "last week's" etc which are not clear to me. I understand that yesterday was disregarded. What got me confused was 1- the fact that the text from the MultiPivotsv2 indicator shows the "current day" with yesterday's data, and "previous day" with the day's before data. 2- Maybe I stil have the wrong timing on the charts, although I changed the indicator's time to GMT+4. I use IBFX whose charts are gmt. BTW. Aren't the entry points R1+20 and S1-20 and not 2? I'll appreciate your clearing that up. Thanks a lot Herty

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks for the settings and entries for tonight's trades...much appreciated. Could you continue to make these posts for awhile until I get math down?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Blueace, Did you make any trades on GBP/USD last week? If yes, what are the results? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
'xcuse the long silence. Downloaded 52 trojans Saturday and took a while to get back online. Everything works perfect again thanks to freeware MalwareBytes' Anti-malware. IBFX is alway GMT. So now it's five hours different from EDT; in the winter 6 from EST. (Add hours as you go west.) An adjustable pivot indicator sounds good and will try 'em out and see what I get. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi @ll, FYI, EU Sell Entry pickup and Hit Target on FXCM. EU Sell - 38.5pips. EU Buy - Pending. UJ Sell - Pending. UJ Buy - Pending.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
FYI, UJ Buy Entry pickup. I'm packing for home. So dont know the result. UJ - Buy - In process UJ - Sell - Pending

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Dear Blueace, Thanks very much for your time and energy, your input and your graciousness. May I ask a couple of questions? 1) Is there any historic back test available? What have been your personal returns and DDs been in your live trading? 2) Is there any special logic for the currency pairs you've chosen and those you haven't? 3) Cna you direct me to a link which explains why pivot points are predictive? Thanks so much, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #62 ---
E/U Sell and U/J buy both hit there TP. Pretty good first day. Thanks again Blueace.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I recommend using the ST-Pivot Points indicator as it leaves the past days PPs on the chart. The entry points are R1+2 an S1-2.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Nope, no GU last week, there was only 1 trade that was triggered last week and it was EU for a win on Tuesday.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I'll post my trades for tonight and tomorrow night as well for everyone. Glad you find them of help.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I'd agree we had a good night last night. If as recommended one did not risk any more than 1% for each trade that would be a return of 3% on your equity from last night. Sorry I'm just not getting back to everyone's questions, but as I mentioned before this is a 'set and forget' so I set my trades and went to bed last night.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Bluace, Thanks for your reply. I stupidly failed to notice that your prices include tenths of pips, so you add/subtract 20 tenths of pips. Thanks, I'll change to to the SP pivot. Herty

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Blueace. I'm fairly new to forex, and have blown up my account a couple times. All in all, with some "training" packages that I've picked up along the way, I've burned at least $1000. Each time the account would last a little longer, but with the same outcome. I came across this site, and decided I'd test some of the systems on here and see how they do. With that being said, I have a question about the information above. It looks as though with this setup, we end up buying when price has already made a move up, and sell when it has already made a move down. Am I seeing that right? If so why? What happened to buying low and selling high? I'll hopefully be up in a few hours to try it out on a demo account and see if what I understand works Thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi fkforex and welcome to ff. Buying low and selling high sounds alot easier than it is, so blueace came up with this system which basically catches a move already in progress. We are not trying to catch the whole move, just a piece of it. That's all we really need. I just started trading this method, so well see how it goes. One thing this system teaches you is patience, which is one of the hardest things for me. I think you came to the right place to learn, Most of what I know about trading, is from this site. That being said i am no expert and im still only micro trading, but i learn something new everyday.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks. I'm going to give it a go for a while and wait to see results before funding an account again Learned my lesson...Finally I've posted an excel file to hopefully make things a little faster for finding the daily range from the week before

--- 帖子 #72 ---
if I am not wrong yr excel spreadsheet should compute the daily range in pips eg for eurusd monday High 1.4808 L1.4696 daily rane for monday is (1.4808-1.4696)*10000 = 112 pips so tues is 172 pips wed is 126 pips thu is 139 pips fri is 127 pips and last week av daily range is 135.2

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I couldn't have stated it any better than Nick just did. We capitalize on current moves. Picking bottoms and tops is a recipe for blowing accounts as you have already found out Fkforex. Slow and steady wins this race every time. Patience and Discipline are your biggest assets if you can wrangle them in. I have quite a bit to say about that on the link in my signature. (I hope that's okay to say here) I'll post my signals here in a little bit.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
last night we had two winners EU and UJ. +3% total. OKAY just as I was putting this post together we got hit with something . I have two trades already opened. I had entered mine in quickly to get my signals to you guys. This is very rare, but of course as I'm trying to share what I do I get a super curveball like this one. Here are/were my setups. We have three green lights for tonight. here are the movements as I see on Oanda . GU 156.4 (last weeks avg 135.2) GJ 186.2 (172.8) EJ 145.6 (158.1) GU LONG 1.79126 SL 1.78472 TP 1.80037 SHORT 1.77494 SL 1.77947 TP 1.76885 GJ LONG 194.908 SL 194.176 TP 195.830 SHORT 192.906 SL 193.596 TP 192.046 EJ LONG 158.487 SL 157.951 TP 159.190 SHORT 156.970 SL 157.500 TP 156.275

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I know, I couldnt get my trades in fast enough, I just made the G/U sell. Missed the G/J, but my spread is so high on that pair (9) im not really sure i want to trade it anyway. Thanks for posting your trades Blueace

--- 帖子 #76 ---
9 pip spread? ouch. Fortunately during the London session Oanda drops GJ to 4.5, but I did just bite off 7 pips. There must have been some kind of news hit that I was not aware of. Nothing scheduled that's for sure. FYI on my entries for GJ I use a 3.5 buffer instead of the 2 pip buffer on the rest of them.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Just a quick question, Blueace. If the prior day's movements are as you say for GU and GJ and are higher than the prior week's average, why are you then trading those pairs? I thought that took them out of consideration. Can you clarify? Also, thanks for posting the trades. Guess you have to be fast at math with this strategy! Scott

--- 帖子 #78 ---
wonderful questions...maybe I should look at what I'm typing when I'm typing. Those were typos. GU last week avg was 172.8 and today's move was 156.4 GJ last week avg was 194.8 and today's move was 186.2 EJ last week avg was 158.1 and today's move was 145.6 My apologies. The unexpected big move rushed me a bit. Sorry about that. Moves like that are unheard of...well with this system that is. The whole time I've been trading this I've never seen one like it. Expect the unexpected with forex I suppose.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Great -- I figured it was something like that. Well, I was able to get orders in for GJ and EJ. But I'll have to let the GU trade go this time unless it comes back north quite a ways, but that looks doubtful at this point. Thanks again for the clarification. Scott

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Not sure about everyone else, but my GJ and EJ trades got within just a hair's breadth of hitting take profit and then headed back up. When I got to my computer this morning, both were still up around 21 pips, so I closed them both out for a nice profit. Not sure if I am supposed to do that or not, but I couldn't stand not to lock in some of those gains! Did anyone else actually hit TP, or were you in the same boat as I? Cheers, Scott

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Unfortunately I didn't get in and test things out last night, but I have reformatted the excel file to show the averages in Pips. But using the Oanda highs and lows, I came up with different numbers for the average daily range than Blueace did. Any ideas why they'd be different? Could it be because I didn't use the Sunday numbers? I didn't think they were supposed to be included. Cheers everybody

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I missed my E/J TP by 2 pips, but thats because I didnt add the spread, on my platform the price hit S2 right on the number. So it should have been a win, thats why im still trading micro lots. My G/U hit TP, and I didnt take the G/J trade, which missed S2 by 4 pips on my platform. So good week so far, Im going to be out of town for the rest of the week so i'll have to start again next week. Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Nick, On my EJ trade it came within 1 pip of my TP, but it's still alive and we'll see where she lands. It's all about Set and Forget. Same with GJ it came close but is still open. There's some major resistance in the 192.50 area for GJ so it will be interesting to see where it moves from there. we'll see how she ends for GJ and EJ. have a great rest of the week.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
fkforex thanks again for your work on the spreadsheet. I'm looking at the daily chart to figure the daily average from last week. Just using the HH and the LL of each day. I also do not calculate Sunday into the average as that day is rarely consistent. How far off are our averages?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
First off I am going to move my SLs to break even. GJ and EJ with the market closing are less likely to make it to the TP especially with the resistance they've both encountered near our TP. We'll see how they finish up though. Also we missed a trade on EU last night. The EU actually qualified to be traded, but due to the unexpected movement at 00:00 EST we didn't have a chance to set it up. As you can see looking back at it it would have been another TP.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Just glad to be able to help out a little I still don't understand the differences that we got. I pulled the high and low from the daily candles from the previous week but we got different numbers. Is HH and LL somehow calculated? I was also wondering if a trailing stop could be used to maximize profit?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I'm not sure why we would have gotten different numbers. If you have the 'ignore' setting for weekend numbers turned on at all it might affect your numbers. I have left in the weekend information. So that might be the difference in the Friday's calculation. As far as a trailing stop feel free to use it, but I like to give my trade room to 'breathe'. A trailing stop with this system would probably turn out more SLs than TPs if you use one, but I haven't tested it so I can't say for sure.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Ya I'm not sure. I haven't changed any settings as I haven't used Oanda before, so I'm really not sure what's going on. Where would I look to change the weekend settings? I don't want to be getting into trades if I really shouldn't be

--- 帖子 #89 ---
the settings can be found in 'tools' then 'user preferences' make sure under the 'chart' tab that 'ignore weekend data' is UNchecked.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I'm not getting identical numbers to Blueace, either. Here is a comparison of what I am coming up with for the daily ranges for last week ("BA" for Blueace, "SH" for Scott Henry): GBP/JPY BA: 194.8 SH: 194.88 GBP/USD BA: 172.8 SH: 172.54 EUR/USD BA: 158.1 SH: 135.16 Fkforex, what are you coming up with? That last one is *really* quite different. Blueace, here is what I had for each day last week for the EU pair. Please see where this differs from yours. Thanks. EUR/USD 8/25/08: 112.2 8/26/08: 171.3 8/27/08: 126.2 8/28/08: 139.2 8/29/09: 126.9 Avg: 135.16 Scott

--- 帖子 #91 ---
maybe more typos are making into my postings that I thought. here are my numbers for last week. Daily averages EU 135.2 GU 172.8 GJ 194.8 EJ 158.1 UJ 101.1 I'm not going to say that calculation errors exempt from my spread sheet so I will recalculate them here in a little while. But as for now these are the numbers that I have been working with this week. (I double checked for typos this time...haha)

--- 帖子 #92 ---
It looks like GU was right on, and UJ was really close. Here are my numbers from last week. EU 135.2 GU 164.4 EJ 155.8 UJ 101.8 GJ 206.4 The numbers I used were all included in the attachment. If you have a chance, can you see where I went wrong?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
That looks better, Blueace. Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Okay for a heads up for tonight we only have two pairs that meet our criteria. GU and EJ I will post my trading numbers shortly. In reflection of last night. Yes we had unexpected movement right at 00:00 est. I was only able to enter GU, GJ and EJ. I did not have time to place my order for EU. GU, GJ and EU (had I entered the trade) were all positive outcomes. EJ would still be going if I had not brought my SL up to break even. As of me writing this it would be about +40 pips. Not sure what the next half hour would have brought. The reason for me bringing my SL to BE was the London session had closed and the price had moved over 50% away from our entry to TP for the second time. I also came within 1 pip of a TP much earlier in the 'night'. Oh well that's how trading goes. So all in all the system gave me two positive trades for the night. That's four wins for the week. Had I been quick enough enough for the EU trade that would have been 5 wins for the week.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
here are my numbers for tonight's pair. GU and EJ I'm just glad the JPY pairs didn't fall through another trapdoor before I could get my orders placed. GU LONG 1.78315 SL 1.77783 TP 1.79043 SHORT 1.76667 SL 1.77245 TP 1.75871 EJ LONG 157.650 SL 157.073 TP 158.415 SHORT 156.117 SL 156.619 TP 155.465 if you have any questions I'll check the thread again before retiring for the evening.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Blueace, Can you provide your trading entries for tonight? Much appreciated, "Your Biggest Fan"!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
really??? my orders are right above your post. you must have missed them. But I do like knowing that I have a 'biggest fan'. hopefully not in a "Misery" sort of way though.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
From a quick look over of your numbers from last week. GJ wed numbers are very different from mine. Also Thurs EJ. Wed GU. The rest of the differences seem to come from the fact that I enter all numbers to the fraction of a pip. For example for any JPY pair I enter them as 110.111 and any other pair looks like this. 1.23456. Those fraction of pips add up. THEN when they are averaged out in Excel I want my daily average to look like this 123.4. I only want 1 number after the decimal. Hope that helps and thank you for your hard work!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Blueace, I probably had not refreshed my screen at the time of my request...but, I really appreciate your help.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Unless I entered the wrong numbers, it looks like we had two losses last night. Scott

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I just looked at the numbers and it did look like a losing night last night. Seemed like the entries for long were at the point of exhaustion and it doubled back. Just one night though. It can be made up in later trades. Blueace. I'll check my numbers again and include the pip fractions and see if that helps me with my numbers. Thanks for the advice

--- 帖子 #102 ---
So, how did you guys end up on the week?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Just had a quick question about entry. What if price is between pivot points? More specifically between R1/R2 and S1/S2. eg. Price is at 1.5000 R1 is 1.5050 and R2 1.4000 Would we put in a short order when price goes back up to R1? Or is it just too late to get into that trade?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
if you have already been stopped out on a trade don't try to make the same trade again. there is only so much movement available for each pair during the day and 'betting' that it will make it through the second time isn't worth it. risk small amounts and you'll live to trade another day. that's the goal. surviving losses. while there were two losses last night (i'm in my third trade as I type with EJ) it also shows how strong R1 was. Both hit that point and turned around. The market typically says 'hello' to S1 and R1 in one way or another. Either by cruising right on by and waving or hitting it and retreating. that is how this system goes. there are usually more wins than losses and our wins are greater than our losses. therefore the account should grow. very simple math. If you are looking for a 100% hit rate on a system it does not exist. OR if you come across one it will work for a few months and then have a meltdown (as with no SL systems). Once my last trade is completed I will post again and give you the system's results for the week.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Blueace, Sage advice. I am just thankful for your teaching us about a pivot point system that works! Your biggest "non-Misery" fan!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Blueace I totally agree. There is no system, indicator or anything out there that is going to be right 100% of the time. Just want to understand a system that is right more often than not In my example, I was just curious as to how to enter in that kind of situation. How would you go about entering if the market has already passed r1 or s1 on a fresh trading day? Would it be best to just leave something like that alone and check another pair? I think I saw that last night but I might have been looking at the wrong time frame (possibly 15min).

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Blueace, I am confused. You're in a "third trade" with EJ? I thought there were only two possible trades last night (GU and EJ) and that both were losses? Did you reenter EJ in the other direction or something? Once one of my positions is triggered, I cancel the one in the opposite direction. Do you not recommend this? Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #108 ---
haha...I'm here to help. I hope that you find this system a tool that you can add to your trading style that you are confident in. This weeks results. (This is the systems results not my personal results. I missed entering the Tuesday night EU trade because I was recalculating my risk. I know, I know it should have been the same all week and an easy entry, but I'll admit that doing that cost me a winning trade). Okay again...This weeks results. For clarity 1 set up = two potential trades EU - 2 set ups = 2 wins GU - 2 set ups = 1 win 1 loss GJ - 1 set up = 1 win EJ - 2 set ups = 1 win 1 loss 1 break even UJ - 1 set up = 1 win WINS 6 LOSSES 2 BE 1 If all risk was taken as recommended then our percentages would look like this for the week. 6 wins = +9% 2 losses = -2% 1 be = 0% +7% for the week.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
On the third post of this thread I address this. I mention that sometimes I will suffer two losses on 1 set up and sometimes I've seen two TPs on one set up. I choose to let them both stay open until 11 EST. As you can see today that paid off as it offset the two earlier loses. So for the day I was only down .5% instead of 2%. I'm sorry if that was not clear. I will add this point to the opening post of the thread. Thanks for pointing it out Scott.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Ok, no problem. I may have confused it with another strategy on the forum. Thanks for the clarification. All in all, a super week for the system. Nice job. Scott

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Well the EU on tuesday night was a good example. I did not try to catch the trade. i am all about the market coming to me. I don't buy at market price ever. I've found that if I buy at market price it's more of an emotional decision than anything. Emotions and Forex are like intentionally slamming your hand in a car door. They both have great results. And as far as last night. You must have been looking at another time frame. For our two trades you had at least 3 hours to enter your orders before they were triggered.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Perfect. Thank you Blue. I figured it would be a bad idea jumping in if it's already within the zone but I just wanted to make sure. I think I'm going to give this another week or two of demo trading before funding an account and mini trading the system. Thanks for all your help Blueace.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Days like today make a lot of systems look good. I just wanted to say be careful. The reason being today's move was not a hard one to jump on board. Any system that had 'sell' as part of it along with JPY should have banked some nice profits. Make sure you stick to your rules on any system that you are using. And just 'tap the breaks' if you are thinking about jumping in at the market price anywhere. The recent USD corrections have made trading the US open a popular thing to do. I'm not claiming to know the future, but in the past those systems tend to fizzle a bit. Once the London session closes the market tends to get very quiet and barring a big news announcement or an unexpected one; trading that time period is not something I recommend. I don't mean to be preachy; just sharing some of my perspective. I've had to learn most of my lessons the hard way.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Here is a spreadsheet i just came up with. it combines the first spread sheet( weekly pip avg ) and also PP calculator. just type in high low and close and it spits out entry and exit. sl is on your own ( depends on your risk ) if there is some math wrong let me know and ill fix it

--- 帖子 #115 ---
blueace, Do you have any entry today? I am using GMT+3 instead of GMT+4, personally I think a good system should work regardless of which time is used. According to your rules there shouldn't be any trades. Besides, I am having ambiguity about the EJ trade last night that you have posted, as Scott pointed out. It seems to me that it occurred after 11 EST, even though it was profitable. Shouldn't you have cancelled all pending orders at 11 EST?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
No trades tomorrow. It is Friday - plus non-farm payroll.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Correct there are no trades for tonight. Friday's are inconsistent. Plus having the NFP tomorrow there will probably some big head fakes. My rules state: no trading. If you want to get picky about my EJ trade from this morning; I'm game. It took place at 10:05 EST. I was sitting here responding to a post when it was triggered. I'm pretty strict about keeping to my canceling orders rule. This order did not violate my system. As for using another time period for this system feel free; though it's no longer the same system. I know you said "personally I think a good system should work regardless of which time is used." I have to respectfully disagree. Timing is everything in Forex. Timing is one of the few variables that traders have control over in the market. We decide when to enter and when to exit. By changing the time of setting up this system you are in fact invalidating all of the testing I have done for it. It is based on PPs at a certain time. If the time is changed the whole system breaks down.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Since today was such a big movement day I was curious to know what kind of overall movement everyone received from their brokers. (from the HH to the LL) Here is what I got: EU - 332.2 GU - 323.3 GJ - 740.5 EJ - 720.3 UJ - 287.3 We had a great week! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Mine are very close to what you got, BA: EU - 332.6 GU - 323.3 GJ - 740.5 EJ - 720.3 UJ - 287.6 Scott

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thanks Scott for posting. With such small discrepancies as that I'm fine. Are those Oanda numbers too? I hope everyone walked away a winner from this week. Next week will be interesting for use because with such a high averages we'll have more signals for trades. It's important to make sure to keep your RR in check when we have a week like this one coming up.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Yes, those are Oanda numbers.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Here are last weeks M-F averages from OANDA: EU - 172.9 GU - 209.6 GJ - 378.8 UJ - 168.2 EJ - 300.3 And for IBFX: EU - 173.0 GU - 208.8 GJ - 363.6 UJ - 158.6 EJ - 288.0 Glen

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Here are the numbers I got from both Oanda. WAY OFF I've attached the excel file that I used to calculate the numbers as well...I have no idea why it's not even close... 173.9 EU 209.6 GU 300.3 EJ 168.2 UJ 378.8 GJ At least I'm close to someone (gnllr)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Here are my averages from last week EU 173.9 GU 210.0 GJ 377.2 EJ 300.2 UJ 168.2 Looks like they are very close to both of yours. Thank you for posting. It's curious that they are not all the exact same though. I personally do the HH to LL calculation on a calculator so I know I'm not error free but I do double check. So I don't round any numbers until I enter in the day's overall movement. So all of my averages look like 123.4 But overall a pip here and there is no big deal. It's when we're all off by 5-10 that I'll worry. We had a good week and I'm looking forward to the next one.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Not trying to be nit-picky and I'm sure this is obvious to most, but the formula for longs is: R2-R1=X and R1 - Y = SL Thank you Blueace for sharing your method. Looking forward to this week. Glen

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Thanks Glen. You are correct sir. We're not looking for negative numbers.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi there. Just thought you might want to know my Oanda numbers match yours perfectly. Scott

--- 帖子 #128 ---
My mistake in calculating the time. My bad Anyway, your time works perfectly for me also. Just want to make sure, are you only trading on Tues, Wed and Thurs only? Looking forward for next week.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hmm...I get numbers close to fkforex's, but not entirely the same. The differences are very small though. I used the pipettes during calculation. Would it be Oanda giving different prices to different customers? Hopefully not.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
That's right, just T, W, and Th.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Guys, I like the idea of this system and wanted to backtest it, without it taking too long. So I modified the Pivot Lines indicator by Jason Normandin - taking out the S3 and R3 and putting in the TP lines for the long and the short trade. I also fixed it so it does not calculate using any Sunday data. If it backtests good enough, then you can trade on a Monday using the Pivots calculated from Friday's data. Since it is a pain to have to calculate the avearge daily range for the week, I modifuied the indicator to calculate the average daily range for the last 5 days (excluding Sunday again) and only display the TP lines if the previous day's range was less than that of the last 5 days. This was easier than working it out for the last calendar week and I think it should be good enough. Check it out and let me know if you find any errors in the code. I did some backtested which was disappointing, but i have just realised that I was using the wrong pivot calculation time. I had thought that BlueAce was calculating the pivots at 17:00 EST but just not entering the orders until 00:00 EST. |I have modified my default Dailystart time now and the values for my pivots seem to be close to those reported by BlueAce but I am using FxPro which is on GMT+3. I have not had time to re-do my backtest, so I am still not sure yet if I will use this system with real money. (I have been using The Real Thing's 'First Strike' and 'One Night Stand' systems live with some success). Ian

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I don't know. Not sure how others are getting their numbers in Oanda, but I just bring up the daily chart and then just hover my cursor over each day's bar. The open, high, low, and close numbers appear in the lower left corner of the chart. I don't do any rounding during the calculations. I only round the results at the end. I'm guessing the one wildcard would be timezone that our Oanda platforms are set to. Mine is set to "system time", which would be GMT-4. Scott

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hey Ian thank you for making an indicator based on my system. I will be very interested to see how a backtest turns out using the correct times. I manually backtested 1 1/2 years and it turned out well. That was a chore though. As you mentioned the entry time is very important. All PPs are calculated at 00:00 EST. Thanks again. I also use TheRealThings systems. They're a wondrful addition to any traders toolbox.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
No problem it happens. And yes you are correct we only do set ups for Tues, Wed and Thurs movements. Meaning the time zone I'm in I set up at 11:00 PM CST on M, T, W.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hello there. I don't put a lot of stock into backtesting. Blueace has been trading this system live for 8 months, and he's confident enough to now share it with the FF community; I think that speaks volumes. This system has such a good risk:reward ratio, you only need to win more than 40% of your trades to be profitable. I'm going live with it on Tuesday. Scott

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Sorry. So does this that we are looking at a reverse at R1 to go long? We're not looking for price to keep going south?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
No Glen was just pointing out that I had written my mathematical formula incorrectly. Everything is still the same. Hey Gnllr I'm a pilot too. Glad you joined the thread.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
LOL ok. Thanks. I thought I was ok with it and was worried I was actually going to be wrong

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I did exactly the same things. I am also using GMT-4. That is strange indeed.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
How about the effect of daylight savings? Does the system have any modifications to the trading time when daylight saving ends?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Great question. As a matter of fact it does. We will go to 10:00 PM CST once daylight savings time is over. As that is the time when Oanda ends their daily candles. Of course when we get to that date we'll discuss it again just to make sure everyone is on the same page.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
That was quick, blueace

Cool. Do you fly professionally? If so, who do you fly for? I'm on the E170/175 for Shuttle America (United and Delta). As fun as it is, I'd rather be a full time trader, working out of the house...maybe one day . Glen

Hey guys. Looks like the only opportunity we may have so far for a trade tonight is the UJ. Will check in later tonight to see where it ends up, but it will probably end up greater than last week's average.

Actually I had a small charter service for local businessmen in a C-182. When I got married I needed insurance and a steady paycheck. So I had to take a 'real' job. I'm using forex to get back in the air. Fuel prices aren't helping my cause.

Can anyone tell me how I find more info on The Real Thing's First Strike and One Night Stand? I did a search on FF and come up empty.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I sent you a PM. Scott

Hi Scott, Most systems are not 100% objective, so i have to forward test in demo before committing any funds to trading them. For those few which are objective, backesting saves me several months. Even with this system, I do not take it as granted that I could achieve similar results to BlueAce - differant time-zones, brokers quotes, spreads etc. No disrespect to BlueAce, but just because somebody on FF says they have traded a system for 6 months or a year and achieved 85% winners (and plenty of people have claimed figures like this) - is it safe to put your money on it that they are right and that you will also get a good result? That is the way that many newbies lose much money! The only reason I went live with The Real Thing's systems so fast was that he had already been running the challenge for over 4 months ( with logged weekly results) when I came accross it. Take care yorself, you can't count on anybody doing it for you, Ian

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Spice, If you look up in FF the profile of 'The Real Thing' and go to his blog, you will find the Forex Challenge. You can sign up for free for the details of his 2 free systems and regular emails on entries for them. They are set and forget, but they take real guts to trade with any serious capital - he claims he has had up to 19 losses in a row for one system - but says it is still one of the best out there (and I think he may be correct). Quite a few people here at FF are/have been trading his systems. He is a long time pro trader and almost certainly the person who taught the DIBS system ( see the 'No Free Lunch' thread) to Peter Crowns. Good luck in your search, Ian

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi, Ian. No problem. I was just saying that personally I think it's preferable to forward test in demo or live (with small amounts) than to do backtesting on old data. But to each his own... Take care, Scott

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Ian, Thanks for joining the thread. I don't quite remember claiming to have a 85% win rate and I'll openly admit that I don't wish someone to trade my system unless they have done their own homework with it. I only claim results for my system working for me and my methods on Oanda. I also want to thank you for testing my system on another broker. The more brokers that are run up against this system will show if it will last the long haul. I completely agree with you that newbies that jump on free signals are very good at making their brokers rich. I have just been a lurker so long on this forum that I felt I finally had something of worth (and worth is relative to the trader) to give back.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
You're right Hoss it looks like we might only have 1 signal valid for tonight on UJ. We still have 6 hours or so to go. It might be tight. That's just part of this system. For those of you wanting to trade please be patient. Looking for reasons NOT to trade are equally as important as reasons to trade. I've found that forex is a tight rope walk of looking between reasons to get into a trade and reasons to not get into one.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Well said.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Would I be wrong if I say the UJ has fallen out of the trade possibility also? As of right now, 10:20pm EST, it is below R1 on the hourly chart. Everything has been nose diving canceling any chance of trades for today.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
You are absolutely correct. We are off the hook for this evening as far as the 'Pivot Net' goes. Today's movement just surpassed last weeks daily average. That's the nature of this system. A no trade day builds character. It's all about what the market gives us. Not what we want to take.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi, Using my indicator, I still had a setup for UJ last night/today. I now see that there can be quitre large differances in the week's average range depending upon how you calculate it. Strangely though, I have not been able to replicate either the OANDA or the IBFX values you guys are quoting for U/J. At first I just added up the ranges of the 5 daily bars from my broker ( FXPro who is GMT+3). This gave an average of 142. Then I tried using the hourly bars and taking each day's range from 00:00 EST to 00:00 EST and I got an average of 138.6, thus I would still have got a setup even if my indicator had just calculated the average for last week rather than for the last 5 working days, since I get a daily range of 134 for yeterday. I don't understand why my last figures are so far away from the Oanda ones. Edit - I found my mistake easy to miss a bar when its accross from my broker's day close - which is why I nees an indicator. I now get an ONDA equivalent of 167.8 for the Mon to Fri average daily range for last week. Ian

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi BlueAce, I know that you did not claim 85% wins, i appologise if i gave the impression that you did. My point was that there have been many people on FF who have claimed very high % win rates fro their systems - usually without any justification. Ian

The market hit the sell order on GJ, and it just turned around and bee-lined for the SL. Too funny sometimes.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I have a feeling that we're heading towards a negative p/l this week, but hopefully I'm wrong. Blueace, how often does this strategy encounter negative weekly p/l, according to your 8-mth forward test? What is the largest number of consecutive weeks of negative p/l have you encountered? How about consecutive positive p/l? (Note: all p/l mentioned are weekly) Also I discover that the movements of the three currencies (G,E,U) against Japanese yen is strikingly similar. This might indicate that the performance of this strategy is heavily depended on the movement of the Jap crosses (since 3 Jap crosses vs another 2 crosses). Chances are if the Jap crosses move in our favoured direction, we'll have a fantastic week. It might be a good idea to implement a filter (not lagging indicators of course!) to make sure the Jap crosses are in strong trend. Anyway, just a random thought.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Eur short just opened up before 11 am.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
yes it' movements like that that will drive you crazy if you're watching live. just makes me love forex at times. Hoss yea I got the EU open also. Hopefully it'll keep heading south.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Yeah, I'm pretty unemotional about it. It's what allows me to laugh. I know that losses are the only way to get to the winners.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Great perspective and well said. I've found that it can only remain funny if I stay disciplined and keep my position sizes in check. The funniness seems to evaporate if you've bet the farm on a particular trade and it goes bad. I don't need that stress and in my early days I made sure I revisited that lesson several times. Seems that learning the hard way, I mean really hard, was the only way to gain the objectivity I needed. That being said GO EU GO!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
True. Discipline will also be watching the trade try and break 1.4000 to get to our TP!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
blueace, will you move your stop to BE once this has hit the half way point? or do you let this thing ride out?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Since London just closed and if it makes it to the halfway point. 1.4012 area then yes I will put the stop at break even.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
1.4012 was hit around 11:30. Does that mean you would put it in now or wait until it hits it again?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Are you on Oanda , Hoss? My Oanda platform is showing a low of 1.40124. Scott

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Yes, but I don't use the pipettes or whatever they are called so my oanda platform shows 1.4012.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
@BlueAce Thanks for this wonderful set and forget. I work for 10 hrs and had knew I must get something like this to make any meaningful positive outcome from Forex. I just wish to ask about the time period that the trade signals may still be taken if the 00:00 EST timing is missed? Up to 2 or 3 or ? hours after Oanda start of day?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
fosters thanks for joining the thread; I'm here to help. The trade signals are open until the entries are met. Sometimes the signals are open for 9 hours before an order is met others can happen within 15 minutes (happened last week, but is very rare) of the signal generation. But all of the orders are canceled at 11:00 EST

--- 帖子 #179 ---
The loss on the GJ was a great example of why I prefer percentages over counting pips. The pip loss was -114.6 but my percentage loss was still 1%. Granted having such a large SL makes my individual pip value that much smaller, but my overall risk remains the same.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
blueace, i assume you are still in the eur trade?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
come on hoss you know what happens when you assume. I am in fact still in the trade. Trying to ignore it. The semi-volatility during the US only market hours in my opinion is more noise than anything. There seems to be a pretty significant amount of support around 1.4050 that was finally broken this morning. We'll see if it keeps going.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Sounds good. It's heading south as we speak. One more thing, just to confirm, if there is a new eur trade at 00:00, you close that one whether it is negative or positive and set the new orders up?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes, that is in fact what I do. I've only seen one of these trades last that long a handful of times though. The reason being is that while daily PPs make an impact on the day's trading old PPs tend to be forgotten pretty quickly.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
This may be another one that has to be closed out manually late tonight. Price action seems to be consolidating a bit. The "setting" is easy, the "forgetting" -- not so much. Scott

--- 帖子 #185 ---
lol...yes 'set and forget' is much easier said than done. We might get a bit of action before the close of the US market. The more used to this type of system you become the less compelled you'll be to watch every tick. However, I completely understand the fact that when you are trying a new system it's hard not to always want to know what's going on.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Wow, are you a prophet? As soon as you hit the submit button, the Euro headed south. Nice call. Scott

--- 帖子 #187 ---
It looks as though there will be no euro trade for this evening as we have passed the weekly average threshold. So, we now just move the stop to BE and let this thing take its course? Or will you close it out at midnight anyway?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Have moved my SL to BE as well. I think we close the positions out at midnight ET regardless because of what Blueace was saying earlier regarding the pivot points not having much effect after 24 hours. Scott

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Just hit the TP for EUR/USD! That puts us positive on the day. Scott

--- 帖子 #190 ---
My TP was hit. Nice.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Ta da. Again with today ending as it did it was a perfect example of how counting pips isn't my favorite way to rate success in a system. Overall today's results were -36.3 pips OR +.38%.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Even though the trades are finished for the day I wanted to address your question Hoss. Yes thehenryfam you're right. Even with the BE in place I would have closed the trades and booked the pips and then looked forward to the next trades.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Cool. Appreciate it. By the way, I cheated and got .8% as I am at 2% equity.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Why is everyone not following this? even blueace! That area has been reached yet no one places the SL. Or maybe someone did place the SL but then got back to enter short again after 11 EST. That's all not part of the original plan. SL was hit, and the week is still negative .

--- 帖子 #195 ---
As far as I can tell he followed all of his rules to the "t". The sell order hit before 11, he moved his stop to breakeven once the trade reached the halfway point, and the trade tp'd later in the day. This week is positive so far. GJ lost and EU won.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Pls look at the candle at 11:30:00. Both you and Scott had confirmed that the price level has been hit. So the SL would have been there and later got stopped out. Actually even the "place SL at breakeven when we're halfway through" is not in the plan too.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Yes the halfway point was reached after the London close. That was when I moved to break even. If I have not been clear about this point previously I apologize. I did not reenter the trade the same trade was alive throughout the US trading day. The London close is not the same time as our orders expire. There is an overlap. EU was originally triggered at 10:55 EST. A close one I'll admit, but a valid trade nevertheless. We still had an hour before the London market closed. Then at that point when the London market closed I waited until it made it to the halfway point and moved to BE.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks for the clarification. I'm ingraining this to my mind. The SL at BE is a good idea, but then it means we set and never forget since we'll be monitoring whether it has reached halway or not.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Honestly the moving to BE is if you have the time. As you can see for those who didn't do anything except close their orders at 11 AM est they would have 1 win and 1 loss for the day. But you are correct it's not truly set and forget if you have to monitor it. The only reasons it really came up is because I was asked what I would do. I happen to be at the computer and it seemed logical to move to break even after London had closed since the volatility dies down then. Thanks for your questions jlryan87 it's helpful to challenge me and the system. It helps refine it.

The ranges on the Yen pair shorts are significantly shorter than the longs. Is this ok?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yup it's pretty common. Just make sure to balance out the pip value for the difference to equal the same percentage (weird sentence...even a reread does not help). Meaning...make sure the buy/sell for the same pair have the same risk even though the SL for each is different.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Got it. Thanks.

Hi Blueace and everyone, I only got 3 trades my E/J was close but technically over I had a weekly average of 287.6 last week and yesterdays range was 288. I've been really busy though and might have missed something, or maybe just broker differences. Anyone else cancel out E/J.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Currently GJ closed out for a loss and have EJ and UJ open short.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi there. I had last week's average at 300.3 and yesterday at 287. Scott

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Somehow I am still in the GJ trade. It looks like I escaped getting stopped out by about 5 pips. Scott

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Scratch that. The news wiped out my GJ trade. In what may end up being a stroke of good fortune, it looks like I inadvertently made my position sizes too small last night (by a factor of 10). So probably not going to gain or lose too much today. Scott

--- 帖子 #220 ---
My EJ trade just hit TP. Of course it was only worth a few bucks to me since I messed up my lot size, but oh well. At least the system continues to show it is profitable. Scott

--- 帖子 #221 ---
it figures the trade I missed hit tp.I have to figure out why my average was off so much for ej,I double checked and I didn't miscalculate. I guess ill have to wait till next week to see what happens.still in uj currently up.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Nick, Here is what I had for EJ of everyday last week. I just recalculated them by hand to double check against my records. M 108.4 T 145.6 W 146.9 Th 720.3 F 307.9 Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
thanks blueace I'll compare my numbers with yours when I go home im on my pda right now.how did your uj trade go mine missed tp by a couple of pips I moved sl to breakeven.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
My UJ missed TP by about 6 pips, but I still have it open. Once London closes I'll check in on it and if it moves past the halfway point (106.323) I'll move my SL to break even.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I cheated and closed the UJ trade manually a few pips early as I didn't like my TP sitting on a .00 level. It worked out anyway as I was able to get my full 2.8% out of it. I must have put a fraction more on the trade than I needed to get out a few pips early and still get my full profit. So, I went 3-2 this week for 4.4%.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
That's great Hoss. Glad the system worked for you this week. Once we're passed the London close and if there is an active trade then it's really up to the discretion of the trader when to close. I just choose to let the trades run their course. I've seen too many of them go ahead and hit the TP like EU did yesterday. Overall it seems like there are several traders that are getting a pretty good grasp of what this system is.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yes, I normally let them run their course, too. I just pay attention a little more to trades where stops fall around that .00 mark. It will usually either blow right through it like it did on the euro yesterday, or just stop short and reverse as it did today on the yen. In these cases it would be about the only time where I would interfere with a trade. So, for the sake of six pips I made the decision to get out. I'm enjoying the system.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
So defensive. Your decision makes perfect sense though. Since I'm pulling this train I want to stick to my rules as much as possible and see how they turn out. Trying to live by 'set and forget' as much as I can. Ohio State huh? I went to Baylor (womp), but my brother went to USC. So I have a surrogate team. Hope we can remain friends. haha

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Ha. Not defensive at all. Hope I didn't come across that way. Yeah, big game this weekend! USC-OSU Saturday night. Can't wait to watch that one!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
That's awesome, Hoss. Good job. And that's a nice observation regarding the .00 level. Looks like it had some validity. Scott

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Thanks, Scott. I may have been right this time, but may not be the next time. I've got some good experience with price action and simply made a judgment call, but I think people may be better off in the long run letting these trades take their course. Usually when I see some pretty violent movement toward a 00 level you can expect a retrace, but if it kind of trickles down toward the 00 like the euro did yesterday it seems to break it easier. I don't want to change the system at all, however. It seems to work fine on its own and I don't think it needs any trader discretion. That would take away from the "set and forget" principle.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Good point. This is one of my first attempts at using a "set and forget". In the past I've always been drawn toward scalping systems or more discretionary methods just because I always liked to have my hands on the wheel. But at the end of the day, after a grueling 6 hours of screen staring and 15-20 trades, I might be up only 10 pips, or worse maybe even down 10-20 pips. No thanks! This method's style suits my schedule and my heart much better. And with the good R:R this method has, I don't sweat a few losses here and there, knowing that the odds will eventually have you winning out and growing your account. It's slow, but steady. I am interested to see how you progress with your slightly more aggressive approach (2% risk). Please keep us up to date on that. Scott

--- 帖子 #233 ---
My UJ trade just hit SL, so 2-3 for the week for a net return of 0% (breakeven). Hey, it's better than losing ground. Scott

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Actually, as Blueace said, the winners aren't quite 1.5% (more like 1.38%), so I guess in total I am down slightly for the week at -0.24%.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Will do.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
The UJ did hit it's SL and that leaves us at 2 wins and 3 losses for the week. That's a total of -.22% It keeps to our overall goal of minimizing risk. We grow slow but we die even slower.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
This week doesn't perform well, which usually means next week will be way better. Learned that from poker. Gambler fallacy? Don't think so. It just happen too often.

From checking my records it looks like we have a different number for Friday. I have 371.5 and you have 378.4. I can't double check until later today because Oanda is down for maintenance, but once they're up and running again I'll post what I found. I'll have it up by sometime tonight. Thanks Fosters.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Fosters I double checked my Friday's EJ movement and it was definitely 371.5 and that's why our last weeks EJ average is off.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Roger that Bobcat. Thanks FYI I have an additional way to trade the Pivot Net added to the first page of the thread. For simplicity sake and for those of you that are already familiar with they whole system I'll post the addendum here. I have no idea why I did not add this part to the Pivot Net a long time ago. It's very simple and keeps the RR 1:1.5 almost perfectly. The system is slower but it is just another way to continually add money to your account. I do not have any live results to present as of yet, but I will soon. Here it is... Add the Pivot Net to a weekly timeframe. That's it. The 5 pairs that I use on the Pivot Net tend to trend quite a bit and this would just take advantage once again of them moving from S1 to S2 and R1 to R2. Set this up at the beginning of the week and let it run in the background. If at any time it makes it to the halfway point and it is still below or above S1 or R1 then move to BE. This most recent week would have produced 1 loss, 1 BE and 3 no hits. But you can visually test this system pretty well.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Would someone be kind enough to make the ST PPs indicator for a weekly timeframe? I really like how you can quickly visually backtest with the ST PPs. Thanks ahead of time.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Do you have a similar filter for the weekly pivot net as you do for the daily pivot net that the preceding weekly range must be less than the average range for the past 4 or 5 weeks before putting on the trade?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi Blueace, It already has the capability. When the indicator is loaded, just change the external variable PivotSet to 2 (which is the weekly pivot, 3 is monthly) and make sure your chart is no greater than the Daily TF (Weekly, for the monthly pivot). Glen

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thank you Glen that is very helpful. I wasn't aware of the settings on the ST PPs.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Until enough backtesting is done on using the Pivot Net on a weekly timeframe a great filter to add is: If the previous week pair did not make it to S1 or R1 then it would be a green light. If it touched either S1 or R1 then do not set up the trades for the week. That used to be a filter for the regular PP but it negated too many trades. It still left the system working in the positive but made trades fewer and farther inbetween. As you can see several trades for this week have already been missed due to the Lehman rumors from this weekend.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Then could it be true as someone once said, that maybe Oanda gives different data to different clinets?? Please check attached for my Oanda platform (note the 3 arrows for the values). I definitely did not invent anything and still got a different value!!

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Fosters it looks like we're getting different data. Someone has some explaining to do and it is not us.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
That's a little discouraging. It makes no sense that we would get different quotes off of the same platform. But, at the end of the day, they are a bucketshop. So, who knows what they are up to.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
It has a 'pricing engine' that 'filters' the quotes from various liquidity providers and 'adjusts' the price activity specifically according to each customer trading pattern.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
That's disheartening. Anyone recommend a forex broker that does not have that type of behavior? Or is there such a thing? Is there such a thing as a broker in forex that is not a bucket shop?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Apparently, ECN's like Dukascopy, HotSpot and MBTrading are not bucket shops.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Dukascopy has a good rep. I might look into them. I have an MBTrading acct but their platform is a nightmare especially for 'set and forget' strategies. Thanks Hoss

--- 帖子 #256 ---
You can try ECN if you are well capitalized. But even then the broker can still play its trick, one in particular is ODL with its Currenex platform. Some time ago, a client reported a huge slippage which seemed ridiculous for any ECN. Shortly after that ODL was fined by NFA.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Why is MBT's platform a nightmare? It has quite some comprehensive orders you can make compared to other brokers.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I'll agree it does have great flexibility for the types of orders one can place, but the learning curve to entering an order there is pretty steep. I was less than impressed with their platform. But to each their own. Sorry for hijacking my own thread with broker review. Oanda just had some serious problems this morning and I was a bit frustrated. Back to the Pivot Net. If we had set up a Weekly Pivot Net, for this week, for the 3 pairs that did not touch their S1 and R1 last week we would have 1 Win 1 Loss and 1 trade still opened. GU Loss UJ Win GJ Open I will continue to backtest this addition to the system and post my results.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
With about 8 hours to go, it looks like GJ is the only eligible trade for tonight. Scott

thanks for the heads up.

One loss so far today?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Yep, lost on the GU trade, and the EU never triggered, so canceled that one. 0-1 for -1% for the week thus far with one day to go. Hoping for a better day tomorrow. Scott

--- 帖子 #269 ---
That's right. One loss for today on GU. As I've mentioned before this system is not get quick rich, but rather a slow and steady gainer. I have been sorting through all of my records and cleaning them up to provide my history of this system for this year. So far I have the results of EU and the Pivot Net starting on the week of 2/25 and ending as of last week. As I complete my histories I will post them here. EU 2/25/08-9/12/08 29 weeks 37 days with valid signals 43 trades 28 wins 15 losses ---- I don't have the number of pips. If you average +1.40% per winning trade and -1% per loss Then you come out with +24.2%

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks for posting those, BA. I think that will help keep everyone focused and disciplined, especially during less than stellar weeks such as these last two. By the way, those are great results for just one pair. Scott

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Sweet. It looks like kind of a slow system, but if for instance you can expect about the same profitability across all 5 currencies at 24%, the system is not that slow. You are talking about a possible 100% increase in your account since Feb. Not a bad return. I think it feels slow as you are only trading 3 days a week and you are not staring at your screen. Sounds good to me.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I did want to start posting my histories due to the slow weeks to keep everyone focused like thehenryfam said. I know that all the pairs don't perform the same so I don't expect them to look quite as good as EU. I can tell that much just by looking over my records right now. BUT none of them are in drawdown. Of course drawdown is relative to the time you start a system. Here's a little more info on the EU pair. There were two instances of a double loss (same day) during that period. No double wins. And the most consecutive days of losses was two. That happened twice. So there were never more than 2 losses before a win since the end of February for EU. That's not to say it could not happen. Those are just my results.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
no trades tonight by the looks of it.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Well if it does not say something that the Pivot Net survived this week with only a 1% drawdown then nothing will. I've run all of my numbers for the past 30 weeks and I'm a little fried. So I'll give you an overview for now. I'll post some more specifics soon. 2-25-08 to 09-17-08 Total % gain +64.3% Largest draw down -4.8% (the closest runner up was 3.4% then a 2.6%) We are currently in a -1.2% slide. Out of 30 weeks 10 weeks ended up negative. Including this current week. I hope this keeps your spirits up. I know it helps me to look at the bigger picture anytime there is craziness going on in the market.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
My numbers agree. Wow, only one trade this week and a loser at that. Here are the results since I've been trading live. Maybe I cursed the system by putting real dollars in it. Don't laugh -- I've had that effect on other perfectly good methods. Week 1: -0.22% Week 2: -1.00% Hopefully we'll see a turnaround next week. I still have confidence in the system given Blueace's 7-month actual results. Like he says, it allows you to grow your account slowly and die even more slowly (or something like that). Scott

--- 帖子 #276 ---
can anyone help to make EA for this system? it may helpfull to backtest.. it's a nice set and forget system. if we have EA maybe we can add some pairs to test, not only this 5 pairs. i hope all of us can contribute to this system and increase the winning percentage... nice system blueace...

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I think if somebody wants to do an EA, they start another thread. I personally hate EA's and they mess up otherwise good threads with code and banter that I don't care to read about. I don't think a system this easy requires an EA. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thanks for joining the thread. As far as backtesting goes I've found the ST-Pivot Points very helpful. The settings are PivotSet=1 and DayStartHour=5 I have tried this system on most all of the other pairs that are available on Oanda and I have found these 5 to work the absolute best. You don't have to take my word for it, but believe me it's a lot of work to backtest it all by hand. As far as an EA goes we had an attempt by one member, but he added some of his own rules to it and it didn't seem to get off the ground. I'm of the same opinion as Hoss as far as simplicity goes. The system its pretty easy to set up when it comes down to it. But I would be interested to see if someone could create an EA to the exact rules and back test it for several years.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Based on your results posted thus far for E/U, this system has a good 14.2% edge or Kelly Value of 0.142. (and that's based on a Win Probability of 50%, where E/U has demonstrated a greater win probability of 65.1%. With a W/L at 1.4, you need a win probability of roughly greater than 46% to have a 10% edge.) Check out this link to view an equity curve simulator: http://www.hquotes.com/tradehard/simulator.html In my opinion, I'd say based on the strong fundamentals of this system (PivotPoints), the good Risk-Reward ratio, and the infrequency of trades (not overtrading), this system has good long-term viability. Glen

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thank you for those stats Glen. Much appreciated. Hopefully things will get back to rolling a little more consistently when the markets balance out a bit.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Kelly value is 14.2% (based on 50% win prob.), which means either of these: i) we should risk 14.2% on each trade to get optimum results. ii) the margin value of each trade should be 14.2% of our capital We are doing far more conservative than that, which means we can save ourselves from heart attack caused by huge drawdowns, yet still on the right path to riches. Anyway, this only applies to trading EU only. I am interested to see how the Kelly criterion goes with all 5 pairs as a whole. Waiting for blueace's results.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I'm not sure how to best present these these numbers. What I realized I had done originally with my EU numbers was give them to you compounded. Here are the non-compounded results for each pair and what my returns were. 2-25-08 to 09-19-08 Individually EU +22.8% Largest drawdown -4% (My prior result was incorrect by 1 win) GU +12.6% Largest DD -3% GJ +8.6% Largest DD -6% EJ +5.2% Largest DD -5% x2 UJ +4.8% Largest DD -4% As a whole +54% largest drawdown was -4.8% Hope that fills in some blanks for you. The best way to truly test any system is to forward test it on your own demo account. I encourage anyone to do that.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
If not obvious by the results of my past 7 months it looks like this system might be due for a streamline. EU and GU preformed much better than the other three pairs with EU standing heads and shoulders above the rest. As far as this thread is concerned I will be updating the first page with the 'rules' of the system to only include using the system on two recommended pairs of EU and GU. --- Also if anyone is testing the Weekly Pivot Net out I recommend GJ and UJ. As they have the best results for the past 7 months as well. I encourage you to do all forward testing in demo mode and backtest this system. It is very easy to visually backtest if you use the ST Pivot Point Indicator.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Oanda practices stop-gunning and limit avoidance...I would steer clear of them. I use FXCM 's mini account with no deal desk and they don't screw with me anymore after I caught them with their hand in the cookie jar a couple times and sent it to arbitration, but to their credit they gave me my money back. I asked them point blank in a job interview if they manipulated the feed to run stops and screw traders. They said they used to, but technically and logistically it didn't pay off so they quit doing it. Never use introducing brokers through Metatrader either. The Micro FXCM accounts are market maker accounts but the feed is pretty accurate compared to any other platform. I like your strategy a lot. I'm going to do it live with 1/2 risk and demo 7% just to see what would happen.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Blueace, Thanks for posting these results. Could you also post the number of wins and losses per pair? Glen

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Wins/Losses EU +27 -15 GU +19 -14 GJ +19 -18 EJ +18 -20 UJ +17 -19

--- 帖子 #287 ---
So the average Win Probability is 53.55%. This makes a Kelly Value of 0.203. Sounds great to me. I'm not saying I'll risk 20% per trade (only 1% personally), but even with all the pairs traded, this is a great system.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
From your wins/losses and also individual % performance, based on 1.4% for wins and 1% for losses for 1% risk factor, I think we should keep giving the 5 pairs a chance. Who knows any of the least performing now could turn to perform better in coming months. (Even the 2 best pairs should be EU and GU) Can we please have your weekly averages (as official? for comparison) as we prepare for coming week?? I also sent you a PM. Fosters

--- 帖子 #289 ---
My averages from last week are: EU 313.4 GU 360.9

--- 帖子 #290 ---
so at last our conclusion is just to trade EU and GU? if this is so.. maybe we can backtest from 2006... i think 2 or 3 years backtest is good to prove the winning percentage of one system.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
That was the conclusion that I have come to. Feel free to apply it to as many pairs as you wish. Unless I am presented with overwhelming evidence that it's more profitable to apply it to more than these two I am only going to trade EU and GU. An EA of this system would be helpful in conducting a further backtest. I have my actual results from february as I have posted, but as all of my trades were done by hand. Any further backtesting would also have to be done by hand. I have my rough results and that is how I came up with the system in the first place. So I am satisfied of it's results and will continue to trade this system. For those of you that wish to have a more in depth backtest I would appreciate some help in gathering the needed weekly averages.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I have difficulty logging into Oanda FX Game since last night. Anybody with similar experience please?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Yes, that's good If there are just EU and GU have a high percentage of winning, it's not problem..1 pairs, 2 pairs or 5 pairs it's the same. if 5 pairs the lot size is less if 2 pairs the lot size is more it's the same i think, the most important is the winning percentage.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
i want to ask something, for Monday Pivot we use Friday or Sunday?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
This system only trades 3 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Looks like a no-trade night for the system. EU and GU were both over last week's average range today. Scott

--- 帖子 #297 ---
We have green lights on both EU and GU tonight. My trades are placed... hoping for a couple wins! Scott

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hey there, I haven't checked the numbers for last week and the setups for tonight. Think you could you pass them along?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi. Here are Blueace's numbers for tonight: EU LONG 1.47910 SL 1.47168 TP 1.48953 SHORT 1.45952 SL 1.46529 TP 1.45157 GU LONG 1.86272 SL 1.85666 TP 1.87110 SHORT 1.84579 SL 1.85116 TP 1.83844

--- 帖子 #300 ---
bummer...didn't get hit today...but it keeps winding up tighter and tighter...

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Anyone know what happened to blueace, Did he get banned? I cant imagine for what.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I've spoken with Blueace. He is currently on a "timeout" due to a signature infraction. He'll be back as soon as he is able. Scott

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Both EU and GU are eligible for trades tonight. Good luck, all! Scott

--- 帖子 #304 ---
1-1 today on the pound. +.8%.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Yes, indeed. A good day for the system, and a positive week overall. Hopefully we can build on it next week. Scott

--- 帖子 #306 ---
So risking 1% per trade this week. There were only 2 trades this week. Both on the GU for 1 win and 1 loss. Giving a total outcome of +.38% for the week. Slow and steady she goes.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
as EU and GU have both exceeded their averages from last week there are no trades for 9/30. My averages for last week were EU 214.8 GU 235.2

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Anyone still with us here? Looks like we have another night of no trades. Both EU and GU have exceeded last weeks averages again.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
still here

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Alive and well. Scott

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Last weeks daily averages (minus sunday) EU 214.8 GU 235.2 how do my numbers compare with you guys?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
We have a green light for 10/7 on EU!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Yes SetandForget you're right. EU had the green light for last night. As of right now we still haven't had an entry.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
EU gave us a loss today. -60.8 pips or -1%

--- 帖子 #315 ---
We have a go on EU for tonight.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thanks, Blueace, and welcome back! Scott

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Welcome back Blueace, and kudos to SetandForget for priming the thread

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I thought SetandForget did a great job! Glad to be back.

I thought I would post the results of this system since the inception of the thread. The past few weeks have been rough for most systems and this one is not excluded. Of course once it was realized that EU and GU had a much better performance overall with the Pivot Net I dropped the JPY pairs from the official version and for simplicity sake. I personally still follow the JPY pairs with this system and trade them. The thread began on 8-26 and as of today has produced 16 wins and 16 losses (that is including all 5 pairs from the original system EU, EU, GJ, EJ and UJ). With the average win being +1.4% and the average loss being -1%. That results in an overall positive outcome so far. +6.4% for the past 8 weeks (with one more day left to trade this week.) A meager return as far as forex trading goes, but what is important is that it has survived the current madness. While an average +.8% return per week might not seem like much it would result in a +41.6% for a year. Also the current results are a low compared to what this system typically returns. If you've been paying attention you'll also ask "What about only EU and GU for trading this system?" If only trading those two pairs then the total is 6 wins and 8 losses. At an average of +1.4% per win and -1% per loss. It would currently stand at only +.4%

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Well it has certainly been bleak since I decided to share my system with you fine folks here on FF. I figured as much would happen. That seems to be the nature of trading forex. Once you learn something or figure it out it decides to take a break while everyone is watching. Since this thread was started the system has produced -78.3 pips and +2.68% return. If you've read the thread you'll understand how it is possible to have negative pips but a positive return (and no we don't use interest gained here). As of 9/30 the official version of this method was boiled down to 2 pairs EU and GU. I personally trade the PN (Pivot Net) on 5 pairs. EU, GU, GJ, EJ and UJ. I have traded all five pairs since the beginning of the thread and it has produced 25 wins and 21 losses. The average win produces +1.38% and the average loss -1% That's a total of +13.5% over 11 weeks. An average of +1.23% a week. While it is a small average return per week it is consistent and still blows your average savings account return out of the water. Just thought I'd update the thread and wish you all many pips!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Just to let you know the 'faithfuls' are still following the thread and tracking the method. I have personally been blessed through this thread.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
fosters I'm glad to hear that you are still trading the method. most of my questions and discussion about the method come via my blog so I'm glad to see a post here on FF. what pairs are you trading? have you made any personal alterations? I'm always curious to know how people handle the system personally.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I also check the blog regularly. Infact, I pick and use its signals. The adjustments I did is to limit my risk to .5% spread in 2 trades per pair (that's .25% per trade). On a trade, I follow the TP, on the other one I use half TP distance as my TP. Also, it is not completely set and forget since I monitor in half-hourly or hourly interval as time/conditions permit, so that the moment the one on half TP is closed, I move the other one to BE. This is because I observed that sometimes trade do go past half of TP and still go back to hit SL.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
But where would I find that blog?? thanks Forex37
