AUSTRALIA IS THE FIRST COUNTRY/OPEN MARKET OF THE DAY AND I CALL IT AS AUSTRALIAN ZONE SECOND IS JAPAN,KOREA,CHINA,BRITAIN,USA&amp;ETC WHICH MEANS AUSTRALIAN ZONE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LEADING MARKET OF THE DAY EVEN THOUGH AUSTRALIA HAS A 9 HOURS OPEN MARKET,I JUST TAKE IT FOR 8 HOUR ONLY.AS 24 HOURS DIVIDED BY 3=8 HOURS=9pm gmt --&gt; 5am gmt

--- 帖子 #12 ---
wait untill candle close outside the box(body only.wick not counted) breakout can be instant breakout can be breakout candle first,then the market will pullback&amp;reverse&amp; later on only it continue its journey towards minimum tp thats why u need to practice&amp;there are 2 types of entries instant/pending order

So,in essence this system is just like Asian range breakout+fibonacci?Also you don't trade pairs with currencys which have high impact news on that day? How long you are trading this? I am asking this out of curiosity...not to offend

--- 帖子 #31 ---
i have use this system for few years already.its because it suit my style of trading.why i don't trade high impact news?for me,setup that caused by news actually is not a real "setup". if u guys have other opinion to enhance this system,pls shout it here...maybe we all can get benefit from it.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Zach. Your system is looking great so far. All the best and pips to you. Any date on when you will share this indicator?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
interesting @Eroll - thank you I use this strategy from 23:00-06:00 GMT, tp/SL support/resistance with good results. I will try out your time.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
hi, I'm really interested in this strategy. Do you put pending buy/sell orders on both ends or do you sit in front of the screen all day to spot the breakout?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi ErollZach, I like what i see here, i have been to this same place already and what you are doing looks good. I have posted her on FF a script that places the pending order on the chart at 100 level with take profit at 161.8 and the zero (0) level as stop loss if we can get someone to adjust this, it would help in this strategy for semi manual trading, it's just a drag and drop from script section on Indicator window panel. Cheers!!! I guess for now one would have to adjust the stop loss to the 50 level until someone adjusts the mql file. what would be good is if they can add up the 3rd level of tp. The third level of the take profit would come in handy if the breakout actual goes for the long run and not turn back at 161.8.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Subscribed. A tried and tested strategy, would like to know how this can be improved.

hi there. thank you for this pasca eagle trading strategy. i have tested it before. if im not mistaken,there have a few indicator and moving averages involved&amp;the time frame is 30 minutes. The support&amp;resistance range also different. i've tested it before and the result is not good enough for me. anyhow,i hope other trader will test it and have a consistent profit.. Cheers!!!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
thank you for the sharing. hope programmer will do it for our use. when i talk about indicator,it is about : 1. how we want to determine the market is in 'instant breakout' or not? 2. Valid or fake breakout?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
before i continue my analysis for today,if u want to test forward this trading system,please do it at 'real acc' u can have 30usd instant welcome bonus without make any deposit (this acc is for training purpose only) https://tickmill.com/promotions/welcome-account / just register your email. thats it. (by the way, i don't have any benefit if u guys register through the link )

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Waiting for your analysis. Again, do I place pending orders like 3/4 pips above/below the fib extension?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
i seldom put an entry above or below,yes,its good if u calculate with the spread itself. if fake breakout occur,sure those entries will hit SL(just my 2 cent opinion) the important tool that i use to know weather its an instant through breakout or not,i just look at this live website. currency strength.(and avoid pair with high impact news, caused breakout that caused by news is not a 'real setup) http://www.livecharts.co.uk/currency-strength.php u should know how to read if u are a trader

--- 帖子 #43 ---
normally for each pair,maximum is 1 breakout per day only. u no need to watch the chart whole day maybe u can start marking u chart first at the given time range u can comeback at market open(etc us open) no need to chase profit if u busy today,or u miss the setup,try to wait for another setup at another day #RULE NO 1 AVOID GREED

--- 帖子 #44 ---
ok thanks. By market open, do you mean only Frankfurt open? or London/NY also?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
YES.any other market open will do.as long as after the marking range snr

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Do you place breakout OCO orders or just take a one way trade by analyzing the bigger trend? Do you trade only 1 pair per day or multiple pairs? i.e tomorrow we can trade all the pairs since no red news is there for any of the recommended currencies?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
#RULE NO 2 MONEY MANAGEMENT the entries is NOT 100% accurate entry only with your money management rule u also need your target daily profit pls see rule no 1

--- 帖子 #48 ---
thanks a lot. where's your analysis for today?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
mostly all pairs are within the range only GBPCHF has a breakout but there is a news for GBP later. and i think its a fake breakout.anyhow,its a risky entry if u persist want to take order.positively,GBP is strong rather than chf if u see at live currency strength. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
according to your rules I'm not even looking at GBPCHF. I'm just watching EURJPY and CHFJPY as there is no news for those. Is this correct? Or should I be looking at all the pairs?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
same with me

--- 帖子 #52 ---
great.

--- 帖子 #53 ---

Hey Erollzach..trying out this strategy so far profited from it this morning! To make the fib easier could you please post your fib breakout box indicator? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Interesting idea I hope it works out well for you, out of interest would you set up a TE so that we could potentially follow and see the theories potential success? The major downfall I feel you will encounter with this will be identifying the difference between a real and fake breakout, but again I hope you figure this pitfall out and win all the pips!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi ErollZach, I have one question with regards to entry point, on post 58 (I think), you must have placed a pending order. If you had waited for the candle to close, your entry point would have at a much lower price. So, my question is, do we wait for the breaking candle (the candle that breaks either high point or low point) to close or do we place pending orders. Or, is it a gut feel, cause if you look at post 58, the price was tracking downward at a nice pace. Regards Marcel

Short Breakout CHFJPY Long Breakout NZDUSD

--- 帖子 #66 ---
First u need to confirm the breakout itself.short or long.(wait till candle close and break the snr)-bull candle break&amp;close above resistance/bearish candle break&amp;close below the support. normally price will retrace/find the fibonacci line a good trader should place a pending order instead of instant order

Hello EZ. Thanks for sharing. To my understanding, your entry is on break (high or low) of bar, which closes outside range. This basically gives the set up a 1:1, R:R, taking into account spread &amp; slippage created due to entry some pips from actually BO. To those waiting for indicator, either figure out the times and draw your own box, or find indy that marks up times of day. My fave is called "i-Sessions". And MT4 has fibo onboard. Just add other levels, as you need them. No free lunch. Work is Required!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
hi i found this ea many years ago. its similar to this strategy. i have added two indicators to find the trend(can be disabled). if anyone optimize it.

Hey Zach, how do you Decide what pairs you trade/ watch? And are the times 0:00 and 8:00 GMT +2?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Zach may I ask for how long you have been using this and the results you have been getting?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Summer Hours is GMT 9pm to 5 am is from 2 pm EST (NY close/Sydney open) to 10pm EST (1 hour before FF open; 2 hours before London open). Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #103 ---
If you are looking for a sessions indicator this is my favourite I simply use the vertical lines for the session start time and turn the rest off. I like it because it doesn't color up my chart too much.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Test it

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Zach Have back-tested a few days and it looks interesting. Will start to forward test. One question I have is regarding the 9 pairs that you have selected to trade - is this based on past results? In looking at the pairs I see some that would move in the Asian session (JPY and NZD pairs) and others wouldn't as much (European pairs). Have you had more success with the Asian vs European pairs? Secondly, give Asian (i.e. JPY and NZD) red news happens in the Asian session are these pairs traded less? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Zach, maybe it is a stupid question but how do you determine what setup to go for (buy or sell), is it just based on current currency strenght?

Nice and simple system, I will give it a go on WTI intraday as from my point, besides the inventories on Wednesday and CAD news, is the most technical CFD which should work very good with fibs. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
First time testing, oil WTI, hit (with a wick only) the 161.8 level as TP. Good for a short scalp. Probably will go lower..or not..I will update Update: if catching the TP with that wick would have been luck, later it confirmed and break the 161.8 level with whole candle.

Interesting thread, keep it up! I'm writing an EA for this strategy, it works fine on one pair but the difficulty is to choose the rights pairs. @ErollZach why didn't you take the EURUSD long breakout for example? I don't see any big impact news related to eur or usd... Thanks!

There are too many breakout for today. dont have enough time to enter. if u go long on eurusd u should in profit. Hit TP1 good idea on EA but an EA have difficulties to determine fake breakout.for me manual trade is the best

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Ok thanks for you answer about EU. Yes TP1 is hit I agree that manual trade is the best, and not sure I will trade it with an EA but some backtests on historical data could be interesting to evaluate the past performance.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
yup.all the best!!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I think the best will be and indicator like a small table or dashboard to say when a certain pair crossed the box range, with a small sound and then we would trade manually

--- 帖子 #157 ---
CHFJPY hit TP

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I say an EA would be best to draw the boxes, fibo points and place the pending orders. After the orders are triggered its up to you to manually manage them and determine rentries after false breakouts. I think this would be best for me cause it's hard to get up at 1-2 am to enter/manage trades as I live in the eastern us time zone..

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Thank you ErollZach very much for the things you shared. I gained benefit by following your system.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Today WTI went by the rules, but the breakout was too fast, so it would have been not possible to enter manually. But there was a bit profit even when entering after 161.8 level was reached...

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yes it could be an interesting use case. I have drawn the boxes already, I will add the fibs, make the time zone configurable, and will publish a first version there if ErollZach allows me to do so (I don't want to disturb his thread). I have a question: I enter the breakouts when the breakout candle is closed currently, it gives me a confirmation. But as I understand in post #1, I shouldn't wait for the candle's closing, right?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Nice profit for EURJPY today...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi domba Please guide how i can trade with you?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I dont know what is the averages pips per day for WTI anyway u can backtest and see how many 'instant breakout' for WTI(u try to find 100 setup) like i mention before,a good trader place a pending order position,instead of instant/market execution position maybe u can try place a pending stop order around 10 pips from both support and resistant fibo 161.8 is the minimum TP,maximum TP can go to TP2(261.8)&amp;TP3(423.6)

--- 帖子 #169 ---
wait for candle closed would be better in post #1,csm is following the rules and i know,instant breakout will be happen

Question was, how do you know if will trending or pull back and then go?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi ErollZach, can you explain the PO @61.8 FIBONACCI? If i understand it correctly, the breakout is from the S&amp;R which is the box. the 61.8 is inside on the box range. why PO inside? Also the plotting of the FIB is normally from previous low to hi or prev hi to lo and depends on the trend right. if we look at my second chart CHFJPY, the 100 is not triggered, it BO the opposite. i like the system, but its safer if the 2nd PO is at 0.0 level not at 61.8, dont you think? so it should be PO 100 FIB and PO 0.0 FIB then once triggered, the plot your FIB for possible TPs and SL. Cheers brother

I do not know.what i know is breakout long or short.just plan your trade

Hi guys, Attached is the first version of the EA I developed for this strategy. The features of this first version are: It will draw the breakout box using the (start/end) hours specified in the input parameters, as soon as the end hour is reached It will open a trade if there is a breakout (the breakout candle must be closed before the trade will be opened) and draw the fibonacci retracement as specified by ErollZach as soon as the position is opened The SL and TP are configurable, the values specified must be percent of fibo retracement (ie you can set any integer &gt; 100 for TP, any integer &lt; 100 for SL) You can set the EA to close the opened orders for the day at a specific time if SL or TP are not reached (see CloseDayOrderAtHour ad CloseDayOrderAtMin parameters) You can use the AsianSessionPipsMax parameter to disable trading if the asian session pips is too high because often you will not get a valid breakout or ADR will be reached already You can set VisualMode= false to disable the visual + logging stuff (box, fibo..) and use it to trade only. It can be useful to speedup backtests. Also be advised that this first version must be attached to each pair you want to trade. It does not choose the pairs nor trade multipairs by itself. You can disable auto trading with parameter TradingEnabled=false if you want to allow a pair to trade one day, and disable it another day. I may add a news filter to automate this in v2. I will take any suggestions into account and will do my best to improve the EA, but please be patient because I don't have much time. Don't use it on live account, it's still experimental !

Thank you! I have edited my post to add the new 1.1 version. It was opening a trade later during the day when you attach the EA after the breakout already occured. I fixed that.

Thanks Damiend, is there any alert sound message when breakout if trade is false ?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thank you it looks good on the charts i have loaded it on - will be demo testing it - will let you know the results and if there are any bugs good work Damiend

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thanks for the BT, looks good for a first one

--- 帖子 #238 ---
No, not yet but that's a good idea! I will add an alert box in the next version.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Ok great, thank you!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
ok thank you.. i was backtested: can you tell me why not all BO is not OP by EA ? asian setting &amp; slippage was changed to higher number also but the same result. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Damiend, thank you for the EA. Could you put an option to enter the trade at the breakout, without waiting for the candle to close? I would like to test both ways.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
yes on back test - no trades are opened ???? will see if trades are opened tomorrow on my demo account

--- 帖子 #243 ---
@Damien, I would suggest (only for testing) to setup a Martingale feature whoch can be turned on and off. Perhaps with a Martingale-Factor? Before everybody screams...I know that Martingale Strategies are very BAD...Nevertheless my backtest showed that maximum 4 trades were unsuccessful. This could be a nice feature... Thank you in advance Marc

--- 帖子 #244 ---
i said Not all. Some is OP.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
ok when i ran my back test no trades were opened.... not sure what i did wrong

--- 帖子 #247 ---
For better result not only we must consider BOX breakout but also we must consider previews weekly candle closing. it is too important

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Yes it's possible. I will add this option in the next release

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi, You might want to check on this: the EA shows the proper time 'box', no problem. The problem is that in figuring out the Fib ratios, its taken into consideration a low in price prior to the correct time period. Am I doing something wrong or is the program looking too far back in data to calculate the 1.618 and .5 ratios? Thanks for looking into this.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I combine zach's box breakout strategy with last weekly candle closing for diagnosing main resistance and support in week

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hm strange, it's opening trades in my backtests. Could you check if you have an error message in your strategy tester's "Journal" tab ? Is it with default settings? Also ensure to have these settings: TradingEnabled = True AsianSessionPipsMax = very high value to be sure the max pips is not reached

--- 帖子 #252 ---
please look at false breakouts

--- 帖子 #253 ---
i'll check also what about adding TP2 at 261.8....

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Good idea Marc, but I would prefer to ensure we have a stable EA that opens 1 order at a time before implementing such a feature. I keep this in mind for a future version though.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Ok, yes the TP2 + move to breakeven is in my plans already, thanks

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Strange, could you post your EA settings?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Here you go, Damien. The key is that for some reason the Fib Proj's are not being based on the 'Box', it's pulling in some prior time to figure the 1.618 and .5 calcs. Here is a snapshot of both the chart and my settings. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
you are right. @Damiend your EA Fibo Hi-Low is wrong. Hi-low fibo is take only from candle in the box. Please look this picture fibo line: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Gemmafx, It's not a good idea to take a buy trade just under the USDJPY daily 200EMA. For that reason alone I would have ignored that breakout. Use a MTF moving average indicator to inform you better.

cadjpy hit TP , almost hit SL fib 50. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #318 ---
M0nd, IMO you should think twice about taking any trade if there is significant support/resistance between your entry and your profit target. For me, significant support/ resistance means BRN, your chart 200EMA, daily, weekly and monthly 200EMA; also the daily open price line is important. You should also be very much aware of the ADR for your currency pair; it's not a good idea to breach it during your trade.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Done today. Tomorrow pair selection: NZDUSD USDJPY EURJPY GBPJPY If breakout same with major trend open trade Personally pick NZDUSD if breakout with major trend.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi guys, Attached is the EA (see post #219 to know more about it) version 1.2. I fixed the major issues that you have reported to me (Thank you again for your tests!). Below is the full list: Bug fix fibo hilow not correct, post #257 and #258 send an alert box when there is a breakout and TradingEnabled=false new input parameter to enter the trade at the breakout, without waiting for the candle to close Bug Always autotrade post #265 =&gt; not sure it will fix for this one because I can't reproduce, it shouldn't open any order when AutoTrading option is disabled in MT4 already Added configurable colors for breakout box and fibonnacci PS : I have tested the EA on M15 only at the moment. I hope you will find it useful Green pips all!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Thanks for your followthrough. It is appreciated, Damien.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Great job mate! I will test it and let you know if there are more problems

--- 帖子 #323 ---
good advice here, thank you! ADR is really important, thought about it too and will have an eye on it. but how do you decide what pairs you trade the next day like domba? how do you decided what pairs to trade tomorrow?

Worked now, we must attach when new candle is UP. Because we need time : 21 clock old candle and 5 clock new candle. Thank wiseguytrade

hi,may i know how u break the rules?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thanks to ErollZach for the sytem Thank you damiend for EA: Your EA is running good. Tested OK as a Signal only and Trade. Need to improve for: -Alert box message need name of Pair, so we know which pair is BO. Your message only Sale or buy but we dont know which pair is BO if we open many pair. More feature: Trailing stop and break even is the best function for EA. Scenario: -after hit TP 1 , the SL is move from fibo 50 to fibo 100. Or - Trailing stop every step pips.. Today GJ was Hit TP using auto EA.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
GJ hit TP2 EJ hit TP1 CJ hit TP1

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Yes +1, I don't want to take any credits for it, ErollZach did a great job with this strategy. Ok for the EA improvements. I'm not sure how to add an efficient trailing stop though. Every time I code &amp; backtest an EA, I have the feeling that it performs better without trailing stop, the waves quickly trigger the trailing stop PS : looks like GBPCHF hit TP1 too, nice

The box is using GMT 0 = 21.00 - 5.00 NOW take a look your broker server mt4 time and sync with that time. ask your broker for server GMT time. example: your server mt4 time is GMT +2 , sync time for your box according your broker server is= 23.00 - 7.00 = this is your box time on your MT4.

hi damiend may you say to me what is EA and how i can download it? thank you

Hi Tfr, Please use the latest version (1.2) from there: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...43#post9994643 You are using the v1.1 that contains some bugs.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hi mohseni, You can download it and get some info from this post : https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...43#post9994643

--- 帖子 #366 ---
thanks so much damiend, you're both (damiend &amp; erollzach) is good contributor.. please don't stop.. and keep creative.. i would test new EA... it's helpful... BTW, i have an idea if you can add fibo as opposite current fibo... so it would be sell and buy fibo and adding a parameter to manage the sell and buy order.. i had try it by manual and i got my sell and buy profit nicely on EURJPY note; btw still have an little error on gold / xauusd

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thanks Tfr for your contribution ☺ Allowing the EA to trade two times a day (one buy and one sell) could be a nice feature ! It may help us to recover from a false breakout. I think I will implement it in the next version. What is your error on gold exactly?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
i think so... i did applied to gold and i didn't see the fibo, but when i did applied to other forex is appeared

--- 帖子 #369 ---
ErollZach, I have been trading this system for quite awhile now as well. I made an excel sheet that I used in forward testing to test my take profit levels, and which trades hit the 161 fib line. All of my take profits were 10 pips, but tracked which ones moved further. If you are interested, or anyone else for that matter, just let me know. I can also modify the excel for anyone's liking to my ability. It tracks number of fibs drawn, number of fibs that broke and opened a trade. wins. losses. drawdown. profit. loss. account balance. account balance % change, whether negative or positive. You do have to manually input your trade and take profit prices, as well as how much was won or lost on each trade.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
interesting method to get statistic.u can post it here for our data collection to get higher percentage on profit

--- 帖子 #371 ---
i have a some problem, usually i did get out at fibo level 50 but, after hit SL, the price run to the level 161... so the price only pullback at level 50 and continue the direction and second problem is too many false breakout... when i did entry to ensure breakout it would be late, and only give me around 3 pip, but when i did stop order at level 100 fibo, it would be false breakout. T____T maybe someone could help?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
can u screenshot the false breakout?normally happen to which pair?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Zach i dont know if you have pictures of your trades but look to see what were the differences between trades that had reversal at 38.2;50;61.8 versus take profit. When I was trading it, some would go past 161.8, 138.2, 261.8 and 400+ that is four take profits. I had almost started a thread for this reason... My case is that I could not get the true alerts for Mtf scenario just same chart timeframe. So I probably start it to get that sorted. It's already integrated in my system but that indi would be great. So so when I start this can also help here too. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I am interested my new thread will need it. It will benefit everyone in the end. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I have posted it here. I have been following your thread as well prince. The spreadsheet can be modified as needed as well to account for different fib levels and such.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I also have a version that included if price pulled back to a certain fib level, like say the 61.8. I can combine that with the one already uploaded to make one if you would like.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
on another note, I forgot that this is for a 5 digit broker. I can also include an option for a choice on the spreadsheet to choose 4 or 5 digits. Or just make a seperate sheet all together for anyone not on a 5 digit broker. Just some thought.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
thank you for the file!!!i hope a lot of trader here will have a benefit from it

--- 帖子 #379 ---
You all are very welcome. I cannot help much, but will help where I can. Just let me know if anyone needs something changed or added. I do have the new version that gives the option of 4 or 5 digit broker. Not sure if anyone needs it. If so, I will give that as well.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Also, my apologies. I found a discrepancy in the instructions. The stop loss for this particular one is at the bottom right. If you need a stop loss of 50 pips, then you would put 50 in the cell next to Stop Loss. It will automatically put the stop loss price in the stop loss column for the traded pairs. For the new version, I have also added the 61.8 retracement to go with the 161.8 fib line. Let me know if you would like me to upload that. It is the same one that has the 4 or 5 digit broker choice.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Do you guys still using this system ? I will maybe try tomorrow

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Yes. This system is being used sucessfully. And don't see any change in that. Make sure you test it on a demo account before you go live so that you understand the system. It is very profitable if you use it correctly.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Yes,for a higher timeframe 38.2 fibo line normally is a reversal and many trader open order here as i mention earlier,minimum TP is at the 161.8 fibo and it can go untill 261.8 ann so on.however trader can plan the best exit i also have tested(backtest) EA that create by damien and seem the EA is NOT PROFITABLE BECAUSE RUN IN 1 PAIR ONLY this system is profitable because everyday,breakout is different(not to focus 1 pair only) and and u need to filter the pair MANUALLY as NEWS IS ALSO AVOIDED

--- 帖子 #384 ---
i will create new thread to discuss about an EA for this trading system for our own benefit and maybe other trader will makes the EA better for future use

Hi dear friend, last night for first time I tested your ea,first of all It did well about drawing the box and fib lines ,I put it on all pairs as Zach instructed on his first post, it opened the on some pairs instantly even I put it true on ea properties for wait to close the candle, it opened for Eurusd even without any breakout at all, for some other pairs for example gbpchf it opened the order on 61.8 fibo line, and most importantly didn't close the order on first target point, I believe there is a bug on your ea, I am sure you can easily fix that, really appreciate for your hard work

GM, Can these times be changed on the EA? Have managed to change lot size , but would also like to experiment with other timezones!! Eg. 19:00 to 03:00 GMT. I have observed that especially the JPY pairs have some very nice moves in the Asian session, but then i am in deep sleep!! Thanks!

Hi. The trading time is 9 AM GMT-5PM GMT. But the chart shown is 00 GMT to 08 GMT. Am I not wrong?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
If you must trade breakouts may I humbly suggested this method to save you many a tears? Create your breakout box as stated by the OP 9pm GMT to 7am GMT, but instead of immediately taking a breakout to the upside or downside, we wait for price to retrace to fib levels 50 and 61.8 we place limit orders on both levels we split our lot size to accommodate risk or you can use equal lot size you choose. Basically you will be entering the market with 2 trades or you can just place a limit order at 61.8 alone, once again your risk appetite, BE + 1 after 10 pips, SL your choice or + OR -2 pips below the 100 fib level Use the Fib expansion for TP you can also use Fib expansion level 50 as your break even trigger, TP is solely at your discretion. Attached Image (click to enlarge) N.B: I may also add to avoid trading breakouts on Mondays because of Sunday gap and it's subsequent fill.

Hi all how do you determine fibo 0 and 100 levels? is it the low and high point of the time period of the box?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
YES

--- 帖子 #459 ---
hi this is my strategy it is very simple and effective it does not need to any indicator and moving average or Fibonacci simple chart and candles tell us everything that we need

--- 帖子 #460 ---
What is the strategy? Thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
OpenOrderFibo indicator doesn't load - something is up with it - can you paste a new clean copy

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi, Eroll. Very interesting strategy. Did I understand initial rules correctly? We wait for breakout of morning box with candle closing outside the box, then place limit order on 100% fib with SL on 50% &amp; TP on 161%.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I took the liberty to develop an EA for this system . The indicator is hardcoded. EA will trade always in M15 . It will look for trades only Tuesday Wednesday Thursday . EA will open order if the breakout has happened after the 8 o`clock as in the settings,not before 8 or you can choose your own hours you think is better. Logic how order is managed : When the price has reached X % of the TP distance ,the EA will : - Move the SL to Breakeven when BE Percent ( X % of the TP distance ) settings is respected. - Close 50% of the lot and trail the remaining lot . - Min lot required is 0.02 . I will test this EA in all 28 FX Pairs and post results. Demo Account to keep track : Globalprime Demo 2176403 123456a Inputs attached. Attached Image

Good day! I am currently testing your EA sir. May I ask if there's a way to amend the settings so I can trade Monday-Friday. Thanks. BTW your EA runs the way this system must be which is great.

Bro, Should have posted the whole code.

Does it repainting?? very very nice one indeed

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Wooow many thanks!!! you can create or modify for make that!? Its for the same strategy, but with other technic, many thanks mastercool66 !!!! Range to set fibonacci: Start hour and minute for make a fibonacci (High and low of the range) End hour and minute for make and fibonacci Start trading hour and minute End trading hour and minute Delete all orders at end trading hour (true or false) Introduce the fibonacci levels with comma separate values: Fibonacci levels buy stop Fibonacci levels sell stop Fibonacci levels buy limit Fibonacci levels sell limit If one order enter, cancel all others orders (true or false) Magic number EA start trailing stop at fibo level first place of trailing stop (for got a minimal profit) in fibo level Step of trailing stop
