Do your research All indicators used, you can find free scattered around on different forums. If you don't want the DLL indicators, just remove and replace with Bollinger Bands and Moving Average All Indicators uploaded DOES NOT Repaint after bar is closed.

Profit/Loss to Expect on Average M1 - 4 to 7 pips M5 - 8 to 12pips M15 - 12 to 20pips StopLoss Basic: Use Stop Loss EQUAL to Take Profit Advance: Swing Low/Swing High, Support/Resistance, Supply/Demand, ATR Based BE SMART IN PLACING YOUR SL Best practice is to use Hidden SL! Never show your real SL to Broker specially for scalping. I guess you already know the "tricks" that brokers do Pairs I trade major pairs. Use pairs with lowest spread possible.

trikg thanks for your nice contribution. i have downloaded the files but target band file is not running .

--- 帖子 #3 ---
i just found indicators free on different forums. You should enable the DLL to work

--- 帖子 #4 ---
AS example. I used it on M1 GBPUSD Here is the SELL Setup Attached Image (click to enlarge) I place MAX Tp On opposite Band. In M1, 4-10 pips is ideal profit Attached Image (click to enlarge) I move TP along the Target Band, but now im 7 pips profit. I can close the trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) CLOSE Trade + 7 PIPS on M1 chart is VERY GOOD! Attached Image (click to enlarge) The trade still went to the target Band SO it generated more profit. BUT DO NOT BE GREEDY. EXIT when you have profit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #5 ---
thanks Trikg, could you please share your tpl ?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
nice strategy trikg. can you send me link sources to download the target band indicator

--- 帖子 #7 ---
its on the first post

Sell on EURUSD + 7 pips on M1 timeframe The daily range also exceeded the 20 ADR. so more trades on EURUSD Today Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #9 ---
this is example of Buy on AUDUSD but i have did not trade since i have reached my daily target. Reached 6 pips on the opposite target band on M1. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Please note that bigger TIMEFRAME is more profit, I just used M1 as examples

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi trigk,thanks for sharing this system.it appears you don't use stop loss.any particular reason why and what would you suggest as stop lost

--- 帖子 #11 ---
you can use swing high/low or SL = TP. or hard pips you prefer

--- 帖子 #12 ---
thanks for sharing your method !!! missed this nice opportunity o GU couple of minutes ago... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #13 ---
there will be more, Daily range still has space

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks for posting this system. I've been watching it on a few pairs, and find AUD/USD seems to be the best I've tried. Plenty of profitable signals. Three in the last hour... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Definately worth while testing.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hmm,this seem cool...Hope none of these indicators repaint.I am not currently on chat

--- 帖子 #16 ---
indicators no repaint after bar is closed. always enter on bar close

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi trikg, thank you for an interesting system,, I've been reading FF for a year and decide to register to make a first reply here. I try this system today with 8 pairs on a demo account (use 1M most, some 5M) and it went well. SL is my most concern here, may i ask what is SL method you personally use with this system and what pair and timeframe do you suggest most (handle 8 pairs on 1M timeframe almost knock me off today ) **sry if my English isn't quite good.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I sat down this morning to review this system on last nights AUD/USD London open to NY open. I've labled red vertical lines on all points where the 2 indicators pointed to a possible trade. Then looked at price to see it a trade whould have been taken. My criteria were that price had to be above the middle line for a sell and below for a buy. Trade opened on open of next bar with stop at 6 pips and TP at 6 pips unless manually closed. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) A - Valid Sell - Stopped out - (-6 pips) B - Buy, but price on wrong side of band - No trade C - Valid buy - Stopped out - (-6 pips) D - Valid Buy - (6 pips) E - Buy, but price at middle band - No trade or Stopped out. (-6 pips) F - Sell, but below bands - No trade G - Valid sell - 3 pips (or 6 if trade held) (3 pips) H - Valid sell - 2 pips (or 6 if held)(6 pips) I - Valid sell - (6 pips) J - Sell, but below bands - no trade K - Sell, but below bands - no trade L - Valid sell - (6 pips). Total 8 trades. 3 loses, (-18 pips) 5 wins (27 pips) = 9 pips Transaction costs @ 1.5 pips per trade for 8 trades = 12 pips Total - 3 pips loss. It's always interesting to do these figures without any trading pressure. While I was watching it live, I felt the results were very much better than this. Still feel there is potential here, so will try some more options. Maybe trade it live in Monday and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Very interesting. Trading D1 charts with a bigger TP would lessen parasitic commission costs.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
good I prefer to trade buy if price goes on the lower red band sell when it goes above blue band. Happy testing

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hi everybody, I would like to explain my idea about this valid system. As showed in the following attached Attached Image (click to enlarge) chart, I use the same system to open the order but without considering the band indicator. More I use zigzag indicator with setting 4-5-3. Time frame M1 for all pairs. I have not stop loss but I open another order (with the same lot) in the same direction, considering the breakout of zigzag. Important the distance between orders shall be more than 10 pips. If it's needs, other orders shall be opened till I have profit by mediatake system. MM is considering a lot 0,01 every 150-200 dollars account. It's possible also considering a stop loss in account percentual if somebody is worried to loose all the money! Thanks to all and I hope my idea can be valid to improve this system...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
yes it will

--- 帖子 #23 ---
good, feel free to post trades

As in the chart I open the firth sell order down on the left. I have not profit, so I open a second sell order just the prize breakout sell zigzag indicator. Important... the distance between firth and second sell order must be more than 10-15 pip. The prize went down and I take profit. My target usually is 5 pip on M1. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thx Trikg for sharing your system ,there is an Indicator called THV Trend , it gives more valid signals and provide more trading opportunities than the MA Histogram ,it can be download from THV forum here in FF ..happy trading

--- 帖子 #44 ---
thanks for suggesting! can you upload here or give link? I may have to change settings of MA to look for trend, maybe a lower value for more signals anyway, this system is open for improvements

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Trend Indicator include in V3 and V4 .zip files in THV system ,here is the link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=127271

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Does anyone have the mq4 source files of the indicator, please post them thank you

--- 帖子 #47 ---
hello, waiting some setups to take

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hello Seems a good strategy. Someone to code an EA? TX

--- 帖子 #49 ---
an EA would be good, but i don't have the mq4 files. only got ex4

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Oh too bad. Any trade today?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
didn't trade today, but i scanned charts on m5, there were profitable signals. Tomorrow will trade

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi everybody, I spent last three days to study the strategy I showed on my previous post 21 and I made it on the chart in real time. I know, 3 days it's not a lot of time but it can be enough to understand if my idea can be good or not... Important is the Money Management, in this way I open an order with a lot 0.01 every 200 dollars (about equal to 2.500 pip of retracement). Timeframe M1 and trading time is from 9.30 to 17.30 MT4 (I live in Italy and London open 10.00 MT4 time). Pairs: E/U, E/A, G/U, A/U, N/U, E/J, U/J, A/J, G/J, E/C, U/C At 17,30 MT4 every order must be closed These are the results: Friday 28 august; take +319 pip loss -107 pip PROFIT +212 pip Monday 31 august; take +328 pip loss -228 pip PROFIT +100 pip Tuesday 01 september; take +432 pip loss -24 pip PROFIT +408 pip This is my analysis, but it needs to be confirmed the next days. I would like to know your opinion and in which way this system can be better.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Polindo How many trade per day in 1mn TF? It is my 1st day in test in 5mn TF, just this afternoon, i just caught 1 trade on EURJPY sold at 135.09 bought at 134.99.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Medium I have 70-80 trades per day on different pairs, but it's possible only by an EA!!! I only made a visual analysis...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Of course!! in live you'd better trade 5mn TF

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Polindo, could you post some pictures, I don't really understand how do you use the zigzag. Tx

--- 帖子 #57 ---
The rule to open an order is expleined very good in first post by trikg; the difference I don't use band indicator. I take confirm from the indicator MA Hystogram and Bressed scalper improved. I need of zigzag indicator ONLY to open a second or third order if the first don't give me profit. So, from the picture you can see on the leftt side a first buy order; the price go down and from now I follow zigzag indicator. You can see from zigzag a down trend. Just the price break the maximum of zigzag, you open a second buy order only if the distance from the first in more than 15 pip. If the price continue to go down you make the same and open a third order. Remember.... at 17,30 every order shall be closed. See the picture below Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Interesting, Trikq. Thanks. For those complaining about the ex4 indicators and the redirection, mind that Bressert is only a Stochastic, Target Bands are nothing but moving average and ATR, the MA histogram is a MA cross and ADR multi can be found for free. Let's set the charts and focus on the system now, shall we?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
yes, time to look for scalps

--- 帖子 #60 ---
dont waste time for that. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Image 1. Buy on UsdJpy &gt; Valid setup but i don't trade because NO space near from the Upper Target Band to make profit Image 2. Sell on UsdJpy. On entries i take, i make sure price has space to move to the opposite target bands to have some profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

USDCHF quick +7 pips Sell Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #64 ---
what's wrong with this??? i think i did follow the rules?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
where is the bar you entered? check rules Price should touch upper target band blue line Bressert should go above 80

--- 帖子 #66 ---
if you entered here, it is not according to rules because it did not touch upper target band. Anyway, if you loss to a trade, its OK, there are many setups that look good according to rules to pick on Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
correct me if I am wrong but this move on the GBPUSD didn't meet the requirements laid out for a buy trade in post #1 because the MA histogram was not blue

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I think this system work great on TF 15M or 30M less false signal. But always remember the rules on post #1

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Sample Of Buy Rules Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sample of Sell Rules Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Yes you are right Bigger timeframe - Less false signals,.... But less signals Lower Timeframe - More false signals.... But Many signals to trade This depends how you want to trade.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
it should work, but i havent tried on GOLD. Also gold means more TP and SL ....

--- 帖子 #77 ---
lol that's is impossible you know why ? backtest is always bad and another point the indicator repaint so backtest is useless

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Thank you for your post, but I want clarify... I spent four days on the charts and I made my analysis handly in real time, drawing the arrows for every order; I didn't make back test by Metatrader. More, indicators don't repaint because I open an order after break out of the previous candle where is a signal. It's true, I spent only four days. Maybe next days everything change, the result could be different, but for the moment the result are very good and I think this can be a right way. Thanks to TRIKG and everybody because it's important to continue to improve the system!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
LOL! i guess you are one of the Newbies who keep trolling. You clearly dont know your technicals. ALL indicators i uploaded here do not repaint after bar is closed. Like your standard moving averages, RSI, etc. that is why entry is always on Close of Bar. The Zigzag Polindo uses can repaint because it is designed to repaint, but it is not used to enter a trade just to analyze market swings. Zigzag application is using swing points as Support/Resistance Breakout Levels Clearly people like you will always be losers. Go back to basics and study before you post nonsense Go to babypips and study please.....

--- 帖子 #80 ---
great results. for sure many will be interested with your approach keep on updating us

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi guys, i'm interested in using this strategy and tried to simplify the look of the chart. So i created the following indicator. It paints the signal candle for an entry in green = long or red = short, when the rules are meet (excluding the ADR check). It uses the original indicators (so we must live with the nag screen from FXGlow when changing TF or remove the indi). Please let me know if it's helpful.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hello and thank you for sharing! Could you call all pairs you trade? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
you can trade any pair. On M1 to M15, i personally use major pairs with lowest spread possible.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Trikg Great forum and found 1 buy in a few days - but keep missing these entries - is the plan to automate this or can you recommend how I monitor all pairs to find a clear signal Thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
great to hear, but i don't know how to automate this. I just trade manually when i see a setup. No hassle, i just trade when there is a setup and im on my computer. Yes, i will miss trades, but there are plenty to pick. If your goal is to trade all, then you may need to automate it.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks Trikg Perhaps someone will help automate - I dont want all but jsut keep missing pairs as by the time I find one the candle has closed and another 2 have opened - what pairs do you favour?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Any pair with spread lower than 1.5pips

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thanks but what do you follow as you cant watch all ;-)

--- 帖子 #89 ---
of course I focus on majors like EURUSD, GU, AU, UJ, UC

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks What do you put as a SL and TP on a trade?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
please refer on first post

--- 帖子 #92 ---
How to remove dll? And yes it is commercial if it is redirect to some commercial site...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
No commercial, Just dont load the indicator that require DLL and it will be OK. Replace it with other indicator like bollinger band

--- 帖子 #94 ---
trikg, thanks for sharing. Question -- are you trading this on a live account? ECN broker? What is your win percentage? Thanks for your answers.​

--- 帖子 #95 ---
i just created the system and it is open for improvements. im using on a small cent account for now. To early to give stats Also it is affected by my availability because sometimes i dont trade, etc... Currently my goal is just 3-4 scalps per day. Usually i win 3 out of 4 I recommend you to test to get actual numbers. ECN is recommended with low spread.

SELL on GBPUSD TP Hit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
what timeframe on gbp? just found this and setup, looks pretty awesom. so I notice sometimes on news like say cad jyn at moment....way above channel, i would assume pass on any sell when way above? yhanks

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Still nobody to code an EA?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
1st Trade taken, I think I did correctly by rules. For now just doing a 1:1 TP SL not sure what to do there yet I will try to make attachment

--- 帖子 #100 ---
M5 on GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #101 ---
what pair and timeframe you use? Check you ADR, todays range already exceeded the 5 day and 30 day range

--- 帖子 #102 ---
dang you're right! I thought it just couldn't exceed any of those numbers, thanks for pointing out, what about question about being extreme above or below channel? Still a valid trade if indis switch?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
yes, still valid as long as all rules are met

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Your indicator freezes my mt4 every time I load it. Is anybody else experiencing this problem?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Not using this strategy but put indy and template on. Running smoothly for 1hr, 24 charts open.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Sorry but I can't find any information about SL in first post and also in other posts. You wrote only about take profits. Thanks for explanation..

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Just allow your DLL import in option

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Since none of the indicators sources available the wrapping indicator must call them over iCustom. So you need 7 calls of the 3 indicators (2x ma hist, 2x DSS and 3x Target bands). i can't say anything about how good the are coded in terms of performance so it's possible that it took some time to calculate after TFs change etc. On my notebook the "freeze" only took around 1-2 seconds. When you have an older pc it may took some seconds more.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
you can use SL same to your TP

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Got 8 pips GPB/USD (5min TF) short at 11:45 (GMT+2). USDCAD 10 pips (5min TF) short at 11:25 (GMT +2). Great one and thank you!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
nice

--- 帖子 #112 ---
also got the GBPUSD. Setups looked good as per rules Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank you trikg for the stress free scalping system. Tried first time, took two nice trades, 10pips and the same as you: sell GPB/USD (5min TF) at 11:45 -13:45 - 24pips.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
yes, i missed this one and the one before that

--- 帖子 #116 ---
there will be more. I see Daily range still valid

--- 帖子 #117 ---
this is good method for me too, i feel comfort with tp 5 pip in m1... but, the problem for me is rarely perfect setup... so i did opened many pair as long as low spread, in m1 and still feel rarely signal... and it's always floating, it's would be good if it could be more accurately, with minimum drawdown

--- 帖子 #118 ---
for me scalping is all about finding the best setup. If there is no setup, there is no trade. Since scalping needs a high win rate to be profitable in long run, so only look for A++ setups. Why high winrate? because we only expect Approximate 1:1 Risk reward. If you can pull out a 1:2 Risk Reward, then you must be very skilled to find those setups consistently,

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Could you pls tell me your broker trikg?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
broker discussion not allowed here. Please do own research

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi Trikg , a very important question for Forex : that beautiful ass on avatar it's yours ? If yes , many many compliments !

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thanks for the complement, this was before i started trading Anyway, Lets focus on system

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Trikg, Would you have a track record on this system to share? Tx S

--- 帖子 #124 ---
No track record. Please Test at your own

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Before of everything I want tell that I'm agree with redoktober!!!!! About the system last two day was with profit for my analysis. I follow my setting a little bit different from trikg one.... Yesterday the profit was + 98 pip and today + 237 pip I want tell thank you to trikg!!!! I can't follow my system manual because I open on ten different pairs; it needs an ea to follows many pairs in a same time.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
You are welcome. So the system you are using performed better than my results in the last 2 days This shows that the system can be tweaked for better results depending on trader. Anyone Interested in Polindo's System Can follow these posts http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...71#post8463371 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...32#post8465132 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...62#post8468162

--- 帖子 #127 ---
With an avatar so , it's not easy to stay focused... Anyway , yours is an excellent system: few indicators (No Rpt), clear rules, clean screen . For me it's one of the best and profitable M1 systems ever seen on FF (along with " Magic 5 - five pips only " , but which works on M15). Thanks for your great job and keep going so !

--- 帖子 #128 ---
i will if you post the mq4 files. i cant promise you it will be profitable, but it will trade the rules of this system.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
message me if you can get mq4 files. i will build you an EA.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
No need for mq4 to build the ea. But it will face then he same problems like my indicator.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
add another 7 pips for USDCAD (5min TF) long +25 for the day

--- 帖子 #132 ---
is it possible to have an EA or script to pop open an order every time the bresser scalper thing comes down from 80 level or up off 20 I would want the EA to wait needing human intervention before opening the order Also the EA/script should be able to open order only short or only long (to prevent orders popping in the direction opposite to which way you want to trade PGPB

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I have found this indicator in another thread. Didn't have time to test it. Can someone take a look at it?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I tried to compare. It has similarities but Bressert Improved has less lag. Usually it is 1 - 2 bars earlier Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi to all, someone use SL in this strategy?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
i have mentioned this before. USe SL equal to TP

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Thx Trikg! One more question.. you just trade this strategy or you trade more? And what your profit in % per month?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Sorry i dont answer this type of questions

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thank you Are you saying it is better in terms of earlier detection? (as per comment on the chart)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
less lag, that's why it is called "improved"!!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
The way i see it, probably yes.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
So any chance to have the improved indicator in MQL and build an EA? I can't believe we haven't got any genius here!!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Again, why is there need for MQL? Do you understand how to program in MQL? I guess not. You can call the indicator in the compiled version, so you don't need the sources to use them in your own EAs. It's a matter of minutes to build a simple EA on this rules. For the indicator I posted earlier it took around 10 minutes to build it. It's more the missing rules about the Trademanagement without you cannt turn a strategy into a system

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi, interesting system. Are daily/hourly Pivots not used? At least to avoid to sell near a support and buy near a resistance?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I don't know anything about programming, would you code itJensitzig? TX

--- 帖子 #146 ---
as mentioned it would be not that difficult but for an system is more needed than entry signals. If all things got together that are needed for proper Trademanagement and I have some time (currently I'm working on some other projects which are more urgent for me) i give it a try.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Ok tks

--- 帖子 #148 ---
good, right now the best is to learn the system and trade it with your trade management into play. without proper management, i think all systems will fail

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Need .mq4 source code for both "Bressert Scalper Improved" and "MA Histogram" in order to get anywhere with this thread. Neither indicator populates the Data Window with needed data. Cannot write an EA with the material provided. Turn the .mq4 code over for re-write and you might get somewhere.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Just read your post. Cannot call these indicators from the compiled version because they do not populate the indicator registers -- see the Data window -- there is nothing there. The indicators must be modified, or the indicator logic must be programmed into the EA (more efficient this way) And, yes, I understand how to program MQL.

Hy ! My first trade this system

--- 帖子 #152 ---
will look scalps later. Yesterday(monday) i dont normally scalp

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Guys i saw some of the trades where not all the signals thought by the OP were filled but trades were taken anyway like price didn't go between the 2 bands the signal was blue but a sell was undertaken because price was coming down from above the top band but the MA histrogram was showing blue instead of pink.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
These indicators can be used, i did it in the indicator i provided in this thread. You don't need them as sourcecode. That's why the iCustom call ws introduced. I don't want offend you but when those indicators don't write buffers, how will MT4 be able to show the data? That the buffer is not counted and therefore not in the datawindow has nothing to do with the ability to call it over iCustom.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
To show you the proof, try this out for a given bar i: maHistLong[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\FxGlow MA Histogram.ex4", 0, i); maHistShort[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\FxGlow MA Histogram.ex4", 1, i); dssLong[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\Bressert Scalper Improved.ex4", 1, i); dssShort[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\Bressert Scalper Improved.ex4", 2, i); bandUpper[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\FxGlow Target Bands.ex4", 1, i); bandMA[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\FxGlow Target Bands.ex4", 0, i); bandLower[i] = iCustom(NULL, 0,"::Indicators\\FxGlow Target Bands.ex4", 2, i); You can call them directly over the name. I included them as resource, therefore i must use ::.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
That's going to be a very resource heavy EA. Using 5 icustoms that each call on an icustom will cause your machine to bog down quite a bit. I may not be the world's greatest coder, but I have coded enough indis and ea to know to ask for source code. You also said those indis don't use\write buffers? As far as I can see they all do?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
The point of an EA at this stage is to show whether or not the method is profitable and stable during backtests, we can worry about optimization when there is a reason for it. Hell if the method truly works and works well, I would invest the time to try to reverse-engineer some of the indicators if needed. @JensItzig your indicator blocks the terminal for me (I did enable dll), using the original set of indicators works for me.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Then the ea can use the indicators from post #1, no problem. I always have dll-calls on because most of my indies and eas using dll to compute more difficult stuff, so i didn't test this behaviour. Of course is this not the way to build the best ea. But there are reasons why people only give away the ex4 instead of the whole mq4. I don't want to highjack the thread with discussion about the proof of concept to build this ea. So i shut down any dicussion about it and promise my next post will be a simple ea for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Dirty hacked EA with the rules. As expected without real trademanagement it's a looser EA, but maybe one of the coders here can use some stuff from it to turn it into a winner. It shows that the EA is not so slow as XxLessoxX expected with the iCustom calls. I removed the Target Bands with the MT4 internal iATR and iMA. The only difference is here that the Target Bands calculates only 4digt instead of 5digit. The call of the 2 remaining indicators are done as less as possible.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Guys do u follow the rules exactly? The reason why i am asking is so far i have not seen any chart that has all 7 factors lined up. The histogram is blue for a buy and pink for a short and so on.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
What do you mean? I have backtested on my system on EU M1 and M5. When you have errors or something like this it would help a lot to post them to. If you don't give informations nobody will be able to help you. It's a little bit frustrating in this thread that most people only want things for free and nobody really is willing to do some work for the success of the strategy. Programmer's wanting only sourcecode and only promising things that never happen, traders wanting a strategy and tools for free and of course free of bugs. Such a thread and the whole forum lives from giving and taking, not only from taking. Think about it and ask yourself what could be my part to bring this thread or other threads further.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
TrikG. Thanks for sharing. I have been doing some forward testing on your methodology and it looks like the winners usually run more than 2 or 3 times profit then your risk. Have you ever thought about using your strategy with a dynamic trailing stop that allows you to exponentially capture more profits on winning trades and still use the same stop loss you normally would use. This week I am going to take a few trades based on your set up and then compare them with a trailing stop EA that I created. I don't mind sharing my test, analysis and trailing stop EA. I am all about other learning from others and being successful in trading Forex.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Welcome JensItzig, keep calm, if you are able to read all the thread (less than 9 pages) you can see I wrote something for the success of this strategy.... However the problem is this: after the download I copyed the Ea in the expert folder. I restarted the MT4 and I made double click on the Ea but it didn't attach to the chart. Also from the back test it's not possible to open for the setup and don't start. I saw in expert folder missing file .ex

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Here is a trade I took earlier today on USDCAD short: All parameters were met. I could have let it run to the lower band but closed after 17 pips. Original SL was 10. I had several trades like that last week. I agree the system does not produce many signals even on the lower timeframe, maybe a few a day depending on your screen time. But they have a good risk potential when all criteria are met. I like this strategy and will try to forward test on a tiny live account. Thanks trikg and polindo.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
@polindo: if you look into the mq4 file there are 2 indicators needed to compile the ea. If the are not there then it wouldn't compiled and therefore no ex3 file generated. The errors can be found in the log. Possible ways to fix it 1) rename your indicators 2) rename the indicators in the mq4 or 3) download the used indicator from fxglow

--- 帖子 #167 ---
@polindo why would you put the EA into the graph now, just backtest it using strategy tester first. @JensItzig thaks for the EA, I like your code culture too I will now post my test of the EA, please not it is a backtest on tester using EURUSD, it is in no way a critique of the manually traded system! I compiled the EA successfully after renaming the MA Histogram indicator to the one I downloaded from the first post. Then I had to enable DLL imports globally fo EAs (I know it's not your fault). I then ran the backtest on M1 data since 2015/05/01 till 2015/09/09. With spread 15 the graphs is going only down. Even with spread 0 the graphs goes down. It runs well enough in tester though, in terms of performance. So I added a filter for London session, since that actually is a rule and I personally use it for all my systems I try to trade. But that did not help any. @JensItzig let me know if you would like me to test anything else on your EA. Or if you have a pair that should work with default parameters. Or, of course, what I am doing wrong.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
you are welcome. When all criteria are meet, and setup looks perfect, that is when i trade. I just trade 3-4 scalps per day, but 3 out of 4 on average. The RR i use is also dynamic, sometimes 1:1, sometimes 1:1.5. Depending on rate of movement after the signal. Of course i leave the trade management to you guys.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
great, with regards to management, Risk Reward, i leave the decision to you guys. Since i know this will greatly differ to everyone

--- 帖子 #170 ---
On the EA and custom indicator, im not sure if gives signal with 100% rules followed. So it is your job guys to find out if the signal is valid. Before running the EA or the custom made indicator, be sure you have checked all the rules if it applies correctly. Currently i don't have time to test ea since i trade manually.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
As i mentioned, i'm currently have no free capacities for developing the ea for this strategy. Therefore i posted the mq4. In previous posts some users promised to build an EA. They can use it as base for own developments or add ons. My goal was to show that the EA is possible and has a good performance still with iCustom calls.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Fair enough, the base is there, I will try to tune some parameters, maybe change the SL/TP from hard pips into something got from the range indicator. Thanks for your work.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thanks for the clear explanation..I'm gonna give a try on demo account.. Is there any way to decrease the font size of Average Range-Multi indicator? :nerd:

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Nothing in parameters and no source code, I don't see a way. But there are many daily range indicators on the web, so you could find another one. You can change the font of those labels directly by right clicking, but it will not last restart/timeframe change, etc.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Yeah I also tried to change parameters but nothing inside.. I already googled for one but couldn't find any as clear as this

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Sharing one more picture from a trade I just took, long AUDUSD (Entry by the red arrow). And I have one open, long USDCAD. This trade I moved my SL, at first to BE, then up when I was 10 pips in plus. The price had gone higher than that but re-traced and the SL got hit. I think this method has good potential for manual trading. Not sure about automation. As a scalping method I think it is important to avoid certain times when the market is erratic or around news releases. Also, do we know what exactly is in the indicators? I don't like to trade and not know what the underlying methods are. I am sure the FXglow band is based in moving averages, but which ones?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
One more screen shot. :-) This is the USDCAD long trade I mentioned above. Here my entry was a little late, the candle before would have been better but I wanted to confirm another blue dot. The trade moved up and again I moved my SL at first to BE, then to 10 pips plus. Again the price moved another 10 pips but then dropped big. Now the market becomes erratic again after the big drop. In regards to trade and money management I am thinking about limiting the amount of trades I take as I don't want to over-trade. I trade in the US session. So the ideal time is between 8 and 10am EST. But that is the time of a lot of news get released. So we don't trade before and after red news. I can also limit my daily scalping to a max 20 pips. Or only take two trades per pair per direction per hour etc. The idea of a trailing EA for profit taking is also interesting as in all my trades so far I have left pips on the table.... Looking forward to hear from you all.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
The bands are fully clear. Standard parameters are 50SMA on Weighted Price +/- 2 * 50 ATR

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks. Of course, I could have looked inside myself :-). Still learning MT4. :-)

--- 帖子 #180 ---
This is an interesting scalping strategy. Easy to glance over charts and find the best setup. It's tough trying to stick to all the rules, so I found having several charts and choosing the best one to follow every few minutes has helped me to stay more disciplined. The charts I'm currently using are: AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY, USDCHF, EURGBP, EURJPY, NZDUSD, USDSGD. All these pairs are consistently under 1.0 pip spread on my broker. There are several others up to 1.5 pips, but being picky is the best way to stay profitable I think. Many pips to all!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
ty, yes it is important to be disciplined. Also scalping does not mean we over trade. Just look for best looking setup and trade it

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Well @JensItzig already reversed one indicator, the others could be done in time too if really needed. At the moment I am really liking the entries, thanks @trikg. But I am still trying to grasp proper SL placing. I don't like using big SL in hard pips universally since volatility changes. I also do not like really tight SL due to many "false" stop-outs, so I am trying to find something based on PA, just like the TP. @trikg advice to use TP=SL is the simplest working one it seems, but that makes SL too big sometimes, so I'll try to combine it with some S/R.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
there aren't much system to scalp on M1, but this is outstanding. yesterday i got many signals, and the winning probability is more than 50%. that means, even we use RR 1:1, at the end of the day we're still the winner. btw, since we don't have the mq4 here, i'd like to know how to rebuild the system using MA &amp; stochastic only (i'm planning to trade on my mobile device, which can't execute ex4) i've tried the 50 SMA, drawn exactly over the center yellow line. but how to make the blue and pink bands? bessert scalper improved has smoothing 8 and stochastic 13. don't have a clue what parameter should i use for stochastic's %K %D and slowing. next, fxglow MA histogram has 100 SMA and signal 5. i tried to draw 100 SMA, but some times the price goes below 100 SMA the color stays blue, some times the price goes above 100 SMA the color stays pink. anyone care to help? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
This has already been solved by @JensItzig in his EA, explanation is also posted few posts above yours, 50SMA +- 2*ATR

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Yes, got your point. SL and TP is dynamic

--- 帖子 #187 ---
thanks plague, i've seen that. but i don't think i can put +- 2*ATR on built-in MA.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I figured you do that, so the better you get at reading the graph the better your gains. As with any method Do you use a simple rule, like previous swing lows, max 10pips etc. or is it really on a case-by case basis? I like using only low of few previous candles, but that can stop me out smetimes. On the other hands the loss is not that big... Well you can by writing a custom indicator. I would do that, but unless we rewrite all of them, there is no need not to use the fxglow one. And I do not yet know how to emulate the other ones.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
yeah, i use the fxglow one on my PC. but since i'm planning to trade on my android device (which cannot execute ex4 indicator), so i'm looking forward how to duplicate the system using built-in indicator only. well, if there's no solution, then.. it's okay. looks like i've got to stay with my PC. haha

--- 帖子 #190 ---
that is what i do 2 hours on PC a day is not bad for scalping

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Try this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The VH is a little bit faster and doesn't go exactly along the middle of the channel but it works. The ATR config. (60-72-3) is very close to the fxglow variant. At least I am not getting all those nag-screens...

Pretty straight forward, looks like something I can forward/back test. I checked the E/U,E/J,A/U and G/U just now for 6pip trades today, there were 2 winners and 1 loser on E/U, 1 winner and one breakeven (move at +5) on E/J, and 1 winner on G/U. One question though - I wanted to backtest this a bit but the bands don't show anything before 14.9., why is this and how could i fix this? I'm not very familiar with MT4, I use a java based platform for my regular trading.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
It should be the MaxBars argument, that limits the starting point of the bands

--- 帖子 #213 ---
use a simple ATR Band indicator instead. It's 50SMA +- 2 Times the ATR(50)

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Somebody is able to make MA HISTOGRAM indicator in mq file?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I wrote to FXGlow about the second parameter. They don't even want to tell what this parameter does. My suggestion is to replace it with an indicator we know. Since it only "show" the overall trend there are tons of other possible ways to show it (MA Alignment, ADX etc.).

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi all. Today's entry

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I think its simply SMA100, the color changes based on the "direction" of it, but that does not explain the second parameter, but it would make sense that it's a MA5, so the color changes based on crossover of the two.

Nice profit trades, but no SL, I would be so afraid to do that.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
SL will depend on you as a trader. I have learned from practice where to place depending on market structure. The easiest is placing equal to TP. but i prefer dynamic location

--- 帖子 #228 ---
ALSO i place all my SL as Hidden SL. I will never show my real SL to broker specially for scalping

--- 帖子 #229 ---
from first post BE SMART IN PLACING YOUR SL Best practice is to use Hidden SL! Never show your real SL to Broker specially for scalping. I guess you already know the dirty tricks that brokers do

--- 帖子 #230 ---
good advice

Hi trikg, can you please tell how to hide stop loss? do you use an EA? Can you upload it? many thanks

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Nice shot!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
so I checked today thru the Asian session with a few pairs. on the M5 and it was +51 pips, in the worst case scenario. For M5 I think 10 pips for TP and SL is too little, maybe have a minimum size of pips to enter, such as 12-15 min. will check on other time frames. already checked this on renko charts. but I'm thinking M5 seems good. M1 too small, fast, and frustrating. And as exit, I am not sure yet whether to just stay in and wait for either TP or SL to be hit. Or close on change of the MA hist colour (this seems best). Though scalpers are using their hunches, an EA will not be able to have it's own feelings about trades.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I don't get the +37 trade, it should be triggered earlier or not at all, you entered when histogram is already blue. Also, you imply that you trade with fixed size, therefore some losses/profits are much bigger than others. Not to be so negative, I like how methodical you are in your report and post.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
hi guys, did not trade on Friday because of major news. Will be back next week when it all settles down Good weekend

you can use an EA, or just monitor your profit. If it goes (-)pips. Close trade manually

good.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
agree a lot. I don't use EA's now. I have used them for long, but now realized they are not worth it. just my opinion

--- 帖子 #241 ---
EAs only work on statistically-based methods, I use them for london open break for example. Your method seems to need a human touch to it when setting SL/TP or at least the changes made based on price action.

Just to help us may be all the peoples can use this indicator: trade plotter.... all the input's and output's are drawing on the chart ( it is more clear on the chart..) also if you wan to trade with the daily trend ( market above the Daily Open line, buy market, Under the DO, sell market...) I joint 2 others indicator BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS CORRECT WITH THIS STRATEGY, my wish is only to share and help us have a nice day

--- 帖子 #246 ---
has anybody tried watching for divergence with the bressert scalper indicator?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
i like this day trading approach. 1:1 Risk Reward Seems to Be best. Or we can tighten the stop further if the setups looks better on the current market structure. Avoiding news can also increase win percentage of the system

--- 帖子 #248 ---
i never trade news. when i see high impact i don't like, i even skip the trading day

--- 帖子 #249 ---
now you mentioned it . can be additional confirmation for a better setup

--- 帖子 #250 ---
sharing useful things is always helpful. ty

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Any more setups, guys? I tried it on M5 with mixed results. I'm switching to M1 and I'll keep you posted. One thing is to stay out of news I've noticed. USDCAD news AND Draghi coming in NY session...

--- 帖子 #252 ---
System on M1 worked nicely. Maybe it's just luck but we will see in the future. I found out I'm a bit impatient and closed couple of trades too early (no good, I should've set and forget). Other than this with a RR 1:1 and no more than 7 pips TP/SL it seems to have worked nicely today. I gotta do some other stuff and I am done for the day but here is the result: 1. The first 2 fails are DSS on M5. 2. The 20 pip is a different system on H1 that I'm trying to do (my own stuff, unrelated) 3. Everything after that is DSS on M1. So, DSS M1 result is 6.8+5-4.7+2.4(scratch, no volatility)-7.7+7+7+3.7 (impatient)+3.3 (impatient)= 22.8 pips! Nice! EDIT: Real account, playing with micro lots.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
good results. keep repeating and get used to the good setups

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Thanks! Will do. Thank you for what seems to be a nice M1 scalping system. I've dealt with FX since 2011 and have tried many systems so I will be very conservative and wait to see what the track record of this system turns out to be. Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thanks for the data and for using a real account! I am currently testing M5, since M1 has too much noise and needs more monitoring. I only took notes of profits(losses yesterday and got 5 profits, 2 losses on multiple pairs. I will start trading real micro lots on that. I am not using SL=TP, rather a SL from the graph/price action. Will see how it goes and post time results after a week or so.

--- 帖子 #256 ---

I am curious on what is based the system, what indicators are there how they work before trade in live I have downloaded the ex4 files, but they have opened my Internet Explorer to FXGlow, which I don't want to run an indicator and that open my browser and maybe send anything from my PC! I wish I know how is working the MA histogram, when it change his color? Is a MA 100 and an MA5 crossing something? 100 SMA with 5EMA? http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...8&amp;d=1441037202 -maybe is a better replacement? Attached Image (click to enlarge) The source code for the DSS Bressert is here: https://www.mql5.com/en/code/8310 There is running a modified version, to display dots instead of lines..or has other modifications? - instead of 2 lines it shows just one http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...9&amp;d=1441600885 Attached Image (click to enlarge) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...9&amp;d=1441440078 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Inserted Code smooth_coefficient = 2.0 / (1.0 + EMA_period); Maybe just this needs to be changed. Checked : has a value of 3.0 / ( 2.0 + EMA_period); - that's why is faster. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Those bands with pink-blue on the main chart looks like some Moving Average applied to Close or (H+L ) /2 and H and L. You have suggested to replace it with Bollinger but I can't make it close enough: Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the indicator it says MA with ATR applied... From BB source code: Attached Image Probable the deviation is smoothed somehow . What period are those bands? Could you describe, confirm those biases? Anyway, what we have here it seems to be : - ATR condition - a Moving average - yellow + ATR indicating the band - a cross MA for histogram to indicate the trend - a kinda Stochastic (with HH and LL distance )to indicate the oversold/overbought + Nice pink &amp; blue colors BTW: it could be written an EA, which takes strict entry and exit rules and scans all the pairs minute by minute to check if meet the requirements if yes, the trade it or alert or mail... whatever EDIT: MA Cross was supplied I have found a very similar to Bressert and modified to match this The Bands left which is a MA + ATR combo, and the ATR display

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I think the histogram is actually a "direction" of SMA100. I will be looking into writing the indicator myself when I get a hang of the current system.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
sorry guys i don't know about codes. maybe you can replace the indicators to make sense based on your understanding. I think there was an EA uploaded here before, but i haven't got the time to check since i just manually trade 1-3 hours a day. No need for an EA to me Thank you for your contributions

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hey, you have done quite enough by finding the system Do you mind us posting about the code details here? We could make a separate thread for that if needed.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Sure you can post here, Since some want an EA as i see on their comments, your post regarding the codes can be beneficial to them.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Guys I was browsing through the forum and saw this topic and today I decided to try. And.....works !! Has anyone tried to use these indicators and this strategy in a real account?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
You have also wrote about trading only in London session and you have a success rate of 3 from 4. That's why I need to check with EA: keeping the rules do I have 75% or maybe is just 25% , I am not a lucky guy usually, but I like the setup, has logic also the SL /TP is reliable for me and my experience.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I got to rewrite "MA Histogram.ex4". Take it in the source code. (S MA 5 O n S MA 100 H isto)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi, Can someone help me and explain how I can get rid off this FXGLOW pain in the a.. ? Thanks in advance. Best Regards BBF

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Install a firewall or use it. It is so annoying as I want to re-code those indicators!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
great job there, bc2. thanks

--- 帖子 #278 ---
lol same here, mate. unfortunately i don't code anymore since college

--- 帖子 #279 ---
so, here i am tryin to rebuild the system using not-opening-another-website indicator. SMA 50 fits the center band, but still no ATR channel tho. found robby dss bressert colored, but didn't fit bressert scalper improved. and bc2's MAOMAH fits perfectly.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Unfortunately it's not, bro. I was looking at it on M1 and a lot of times the direction and the histogram were off. Or am I wrong? The bands, as someone said, are an SMA and ATR adjusted bands. I too want to get rid of the fxG... stuff. EDIT: Nevermind, MAOMAH seems to have done the trick. Thx, bro!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
My bands indi. IMPORTANT! g_ATRFactor set to 2 g_ATRPeriod set to 50 g_MAPeriod set to 50 g_MAMethod set to 0 (zero = SMA) You can do the colors however you like. Enjoy! EDIT: I put a name for the indi, which is misleading. This ONLY plots the bands. Please apply 50 SMA manually from MT4.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi Matheszabi, Thanks a lot for your answer. I'll try to run my firewall. Best regards BBF

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Completely open source. Without opening a site. The parameters are selected by the template of trikg. Especially fitted "DSS Bressert Colored" - only works with a parameter (8,13). Thanks for trikg, matheszabi, rkp.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thanks, Modified your code: added the SMA, locked the Method to SMA, added colors, set default values, just the middle line width needed to set to 2 to be identic otherwise is the same now, except it will not launch the browser to FXGlow! Attached Image (click to enlarge) So that ATR left to re-code it: Average Range-Multi Since I have seen many is using here, probably has somebody the source!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Nice! How you did it? - I couldn't find any decompiler @trikg: Could you please edit the first post on the thread and put there this files from bc2 ( I just renamed it, fixed some and packed Attached File(s) ScalpingTrend.zip 52 KB | 1,055 downloads Now the indi list in completed, lets have optimized EA and balance results!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Here is a complete analog for Bressert Scalper Improved.ex4. Posted previously been fit for smoothing 8.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Almost finished the EA, but sadly is to slow to optimize, because of to many Inserted Code iCustom calls Example entry condition: 4. DSS Dots went below 20 and color turns PINK for that it seems need to call again the indicator with previous value. Beside this is a pullback, so it needs a trending movement. Paper traded the first day available from my chart on M1 2 loss, 3 win from London open ( red arrow) to NY open and a bit after ( blue arrow) Attached Image (click to enlarge) smooth_coefficient = 2.6 / (1.0 + EMA_period); it skips the only one good trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) Some others: it seems the London open it gives a loss, maybe the reverse direction needs to be taken. My idea: The Bressert /DDS can or shuld be used at SL : it seems a bit delayed , but it signals sooner the loss then the SL! with pullback trading it should be used a zigzag indicator to get the HH, LL and watch the Fibo levels, ex 50%

--- 帖子 #288 ---
The best solution - to build the calculation in the EA. But it requires considerable effort. Therefore I propose to reduce the calculations in indicators. For the advisor does not need a beautiful view.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
You don't need the iCustom calls any more. Look up in the thread - we have provided the source code. Just use the calculations (e.g. ATR adjusted value from the current one; no need to plot any lines). When I get some free time I can code the EA BUT I doubt it is going to perform well since I think the best way for the system to be profitable is to set the S/L &amp; T/P to areas of PPA (previous price action, i.e. clusters, S/R, etc), WHICH is extremely difficult to code (at least in MQL4). There's no magic bullet/holy grail, you need to trade this manually. Yeah, there may be some way to get into hardcore C/C++ pattern rec, etc programming and recognize important levels but it's some undertaking and the system coded in such way may still fail to prove profitable.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
If the entry /exit rules are well defined, the indicators are well set why I need to trade manually? For me it seems to transfer the responsibility to me, because I traded manually, not followed the system. Or maybe from system rules are missing, indicators aren't working and has to much loss?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hmm. On M1 the T/P &amp; S/L are supposed to be 4-7 pips. I personally think that the correct value should depend on: 1. Volatility 2. Near S&amp;R So, how do we exactly set the T/P? It could be 4,5,6 or 7 pips... I manually look for S/R to the left and it it's somewhere within the 4-7 pip range I execute when rules are met. I could however set it to 7 pips in the EA and then BE at +4 but I do feel I will get taken out way too often considering the small T/P... I'll try to code a dirty EA and run it thru high-quality data to see the results (when I get the time)

--- 帖子 #292 ---
The indicator is taxing the CPU too much, you are not returning rates_total in OnCalculate.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Works well, thanks, but there is a possible division by zero (happened to me) on line 70.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thank you. This is my carelessness. I'm not a professional programmer. In this case I just upgraded the most likely indicator, picking up the necessary parameters. Division by zero error I have not encountered. I think that this error is possible only in the period of the swap quotations. Chance coincidence highest price and lowest price for the period Stochastic_period very small. Maybe later I'll rewrite indicator. If someone else does not do it before.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Oh you can simply change this Inserted Code MIT = delta/(HighRange-LowRange)*100.0; to this Inserted Code double range = HighRange-LowRange; if (range == 0) range = 0.00001; MIT = delta/range*100.0;

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Awesome job by the coders. The target band is a great indy. No matter if for entry, exit, stop, trailing stop. You name it. Looks so smooth and beautiful.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Sorry bc2 , matheszabi and other programmers , with all due respect for your work, but this is a thread about a manual /mechanical System , genially created by Trikg. If you want to develop an EA , please open a new discussion . Trikg , are you agree with me ?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
If you actually read the discussion, I have already asked trikg for permission. Edit: also we are rewriting indicators to not use advertisements

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi, im back, will trade tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Just try other pair, other time frame and you will see a parameter needs to be changed from 2.0 to 3.0 then to 4.0 than 5.0 and then you will ask "WTF?" Especially if you can code an EA and test multiple pairs on more time frames, very fast An EA will tell you how exactly clear are described the system entry-exit rules and how clearly is specified. When you see something like that "don't trade blind" like in http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=551382 -or maybe this- then you maybe do your own research and don't trust the system. Let others present the winner trades only and make subscribers from novice players

Great system trikg. im learning it now. Some good results

--- 帖子 #325 ---
i will be using this in my live account. thanks trikg

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Could you post results from time to time? I'm interested in how the system works for others using live and not demo.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks you for the posting of this system and the rules. i just have been having trouble downloading and indicators on my metatrader4 so i can use them on the charts. Can you please help me when i go to install the downloads on metatrader4 after i have downloaded them on the web. i havent inputted any indicators on metatrader before, sorry for this, but please help me so i can use the files you attached. thanks Trikq

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Or anyone on this forum can help me how to input the downloads in my metatrader thanks. i have tried open data folder and put it in mql4 and clicked experts and copy and paste them their but somehow didnt work. how are you guys inputting them in? thanks help id def. appreciated!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I believe they are indicators not EAs also restart mt4

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Cfudge, so your saying put them in the indicators folder and not the experts folders and then restart metatrader4? thanks i will see if it works and get back to you!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks Cfudge it worked, 1 problem though with 2 of them, says enable dll, how would i go about doing this, do you know? its the target bands, and the MA histogram.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
when you load the indicator on the chart a dialogue box pops up and under common tab make sure to checkmark all boxes. With these indicators you will periodically have a website from FXGLOW pop up but just close it.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks cfudge, it worked!! i will be trading this system next week, so how your success with this scalping system so far? thanks for all your input.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I do not use these indicators for scalping I am visually testing them on a daily chart with an RSI 3 and stoch with the default levels of each reversed, as confirmation. Still early days though...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
You don't need those original indicators with DLL (and opening of browser), you can use those we have rewritten, attached. ball_complete is one that I use, it only shows an arrow to trade in the graph itself and pops up a sound alarm, sou you know where to look.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
This system looks good. not sure why people are quiet Anyway, i think this system is very good here in FF Lets revive it. I will update my results

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i also advice to use indicators on first post Because it is the 100% accurate system as uploaded by trikG! And 100% respect for sharing this very good system! FF Scalper Original System https://www.sendspace.com/file/32scq0 Cheers!

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thank you Plague, for posting the indicators, I quite using the originals because it kept opening the browser to go to the sales page.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
The reason why i think the original is better is because it is uploaded on the first post Unless trickG said it is ok to use other versions. I also see that there are bugs on the uploaded version when some bars are loaded, it needs to be refreshed not like the original, i would never use indicators with bugs Also the DSS is not fully identical in some instances When we are talking about real money, i am willing to sacrifice some website popups rather than use wrong indicators I want to be 100% sure im following the system of TrikG Last week was very good for the system. I got a an overall 8% growth with just risking 1% per trade. I hope this week will be the same!! For 100% assurance this is the version im using FF Scalper Original System https://www.sendspace.com/file/32scq0 Cheers

Hi Guys. The DSS can produce some false signals. For example, when it slopes down from 80 to 20 but actual price stays flat or even slightly goes up. How can we filter these false signals out?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
yes it gives false signals but losing in it is part of the system. since its a scalp you need to be fast in getting profits

--- 帖子 #390 ---
as for me, i do not change any setting. I just use the templates and indicators shared by trikg in the 1st post. what i do is i wait for the price to touch the band i make sure that it is the same color no change before entry. to increase my chance of win

--- 帖子 #391 ---
It will keep on changing until bar is closed. So enter trades when bar is closed, This applies to all indicators. Read first post " All Indicators uploaded DOES NOT Repaint after bar is closed. Always read price/enter trades on Bar Close."

I was reading the past posts from this thread and came across yours. Would you please care to share some more of your current tests using this system? I noticed that you have been trading it since this thread is just new here. Looking forward to your opinions mate. Thanks in advance for your reply

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Dear Guys I am interested to learn how to scalp by trying out this system. The thread is not that quite long so I was able to catch on some things that you guys are showing but would like to clarify on some areas. How was your experience using this system? since this is scalping and the author have mentioned about the hidden SL, am I correct if I say that I will not make my SL visible but have to stay and watch the trade after opening a position? Is that right? How do you trade this scalping system in news releases? do you abstain from trading or you don't mind it? I see that this trading system gives profits to others I am also interested in finding out how to do it. Forgive me for some questions that may sound dumb to you but I am only a newbie. I hope you understand thank you.

Best practice is to use Hidden SL! Never show your real SL to Broker specially for scalping. I guess you already know the "tricks" that brokers do New to trade. Can you pls let me know how to use/apply hidden SL.

Hi thericci welcome to the topic. i can say that my experience with this scalping is great i usually show charts with actual trades it is a easy to follow scalp even beginners can do just look at the author's rules. i think any scalping makes you stay in front of the computer most of the time news trading i am careful about it because i am not good at finding the meaning of the news to the charts.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
i think the best to do is when you are scalping stay in front of computer manually close your order when the trade go against you don't put the SL in your chart becuase of broker tricks

Thank you moneybill for your very informative reply. It is glad to hear that with your experience you were able to say that a beginner can scalp with this system. I am looking forwad to more actual trades that you will post and to learn from other traders who participates here in managing their trades and exiting their scalping trades. I undersand that I have to be patient in staying in front of the computer for more hours i know this discipline requires a lot of hard work and many chart hours. Again i appreciate all your advices and hope to exchange trading thoughts with you!

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Many thanks moneybill! It is a very easy and useful system. Although I would tell everyone, they can be most successfully used when combined with PA and S/R levels. Do not take all entries. I use it on m5,m15,m30, I make price alert at S/R levels, and I try to find entry signal on these timeframes. You dont need any other indicators, you only need to study price. Thank you very much once again!

Do you have any suggestions or any recommendations on where do I start learning it or the courses that I might need to get or the threads that you know that might be helpful to me? You also mentioned that you use this DSS system on m5, m15, m30 timeframe. What are your targets when you trade? Looking forward to our advice and reply. Happy trading!

Hi guys, Now, I'm studying if there is a possibility that I can use the strategy to enter a trade on M5 or M1 on my system. But for GU on M1, the Bressert indicator doesn't show the bars. Do I have to do something ? Thank in advance Sai Ram

--- 帖子 #508 ---
i hope today is a good day for scalping to all

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Thank you I dont place sl because I watch closely my trades my sl is usually equal to the tp set if price went equals to my tp point i close but still depends on how i see the market condition at that time If you mean the daily range, i only use Today range and Total Av If Today range is less than the Total ave and there is a setup i trade. If today range is higher than total av there is a trade i ignore but sometimes i try to trade to see what will happen

Hi moneybill, are these valid setups? If so then the were losers. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #513 ---
for me i will not take the NJ setup because the price has fallen too deep into the opposite band for me to take it before the bressert change color as for AC i might have taken it but would result to a losing trade which is part of it but when i see the big red candle after my entry i would have immediately closed it keeping lose at small pips

--- 帖子 #514 ---
this sounds good will also try it in choosing setups to trade

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Dear Sriloba i also use mine in M1 but do not have problems with bressert loading in them. did you click on the enable dlls from the indicators? i think that should do the trick.

Another great trade! How to use the hidden sl, please?Thanks!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Instead of using no sl or hidden sl, let's say you keep 20 pips for the actual 10 pips and close the trade when it reaches to 10.. if something goes terribly wrong, at least you have a 20 pips SL already at the broker side. Catastrophic events can result in the trade going against you for thousands of pips, which means death of your account.. I know someone who lost 5000$ on the tsunami day.. personally i had a 2000 pips loss (luckily it was a micro lot) on SNB news on jan 15th 2015.. "A wise man learn from mistakes of others"

Please be careful in using hidden sl it requires careful watch and make sure that there are no big speeches like draghi and fomc and other events that could make big moves like interest rate decision as for the usual news you can set stops as adviced by bluejack or you have the option to avoid it

Hi guys, someone kindly coded the below histogram to replace the fxglow one. Is anyone able to amend it so we can input two separate timeframes, eg M1 on one line and m5 below it.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
trades from today, most of them win, those who losts its cuz i didnt put the right place for the SL - after the SL the trade went up to the TP. im afraid to say if this strategy 100% works or its pure luck, but you can see the resault anyway. all the trades are 15min, ill make more checks before going live.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Be careful, and use a right MM. For example, when you buy GBPJPY and CADJPY at he same time, you trade the same move of the JPY ... take the better one, or reduce risk.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I included this system in my PA, trade strategy, and I see it can give me a very good confirmation signal. But I think, when you trade only the pure trade signals, you will have many loosers... So you need to analyze charts for better results.

Dear Beertje Thank you for this wonderful and valuable advice will take note of this in trading Yen pairs. Have not tried it in live although I am testing it in demo, the moves are big in these pairs, I find the spread quite huge specially in Asian session maybe will trade it during the London session for smaller spreads .

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Thanks for this strategy, i will try it, but i don't want to sit in front of the computer the whole time, i think i will go get the H1 with a 100pip TP, looks good so far on AUDJPY! I will post Live Trades next week

I in person have not tried it in tf higher than 15m for me i am always after fast profits higher tf means higher targets when scalping the longer you leave your trade the longer you expose your account to risk

Dear Cryptosurf Looking at your picture is it correct if I say that there are only two setups that can be traded from your example if you are using H1 time frame to enter basing on the rules posted in this thread? because there are only two setups that reached the opposite band.

Hello everyone, I am a newish trader here (I know, here we go again!) Just wanted to say thank you to you all for your great help in getting this thread together! I will be also trying to join in trading this way over the next few months and will try to keep posting my trades. I usually only have a couple of hours to trade each day during the EURO session, and very rarely, early US session. I look for trades mainly on the 1min chart, however I also keep an eye on the 5min, but like today, there are not as many chances during the time I have available. I took 2 trades today, both EJ. First was a sell which I got +4. Second was a buy with +1( it should have also been +4, but I let my emotions take control and I got out to soon! Will have to work on that!) Here are my screenshots(They are hard to read sorry, I have to change my format so they are easier to see on this forum! sorry) HTP is the take profit line. Like I said, I got out too early on the second trade! trade 1 - Attached Image (click to enlarge) trade 2 - Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks again! Look forward to trading with you all!

I do have a question; How long do you wait before entering a trade? I enter with pending orders at the high/low of the signal bar. Usually it is hit the next bar, however I have noticed sometimes it is not. I cancel if it is not, but looking today I notice the price does eventually do the right way. How do you deal with this? Do you use pending orders? if so, how long do you leave them waiting for? Thanks again

You can use the strategy tester and run it in past data so you can test the good in the indicators used it does not repaint then no difference in trading it live and demo

Dear Moneybill Your month is looking good with this system. I've been forward testing in demo trading yen pairs so i can begin to trade them maybe next week. Can you give any tips on how to trade it correctly?

The time of the chart depends of your broker, you cannot change it, but once you get use to it, it would not be a problem anymore. I also use another broker that is one hour back of the actual my local time. Have a great weekend, Syl

Nice Monday trading everyone! I wish I had the time to trade more on the m5 charts, but I am happy with my M1 trades Also I agree with moneybills, when the price is touching the bands for the first time, it seems like there is a much higher chance of having a profitable trade. Goodluck for today everyone!

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Sometimes it is still better not to take trades when you are not too familiar with trading that time frame. Sometimes it still pays to be patient mate Don't worry for sure with m1 there are a lot of opportunities waiting for you.

Back to M1 trading today. I think I need to work on selecting my trades much better! It seems the signals that I dont catch on time go very well, but the signals I do catch arnt so good.....

I advise trading asia, make sure it is near open of major movers in that session. For london, trade until us session open but if you combine this strategy to your own trading practice then trade whenever you see a signal. I gave example of how i choose trade that has high chance of winning i quoted it for you to find it easy in the next post don't go live until you have practiced it Make sure that it will suit you If not you have the option to not to trade it this will save you from the losing

Post your charts buddy and tell us how you chose your trades what timeframe do you use? Your performance is amazing man!

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Currently I trade only the major pairs plus some of yen pairs. I set my take profit when the price touches the opposite band from my entry that's why it yields more profit but I only take trades up to 3 positions per day so that I will not over trade. In my trade, this for me a perfect entry I always find this type of signal. After a steady trend, where the price is exactly at the lower band and dss aligns this ensures more room for the price to move in the direction setup. https://i.imgsafe.org/82b7cc3.png

Try the balls_complete indicator posted a while back. It puts everything into an arrow indicator with alert. Very helpful for backtesting too. I use that and the bands indicator for my profit taking. I have tested it against the original posted indicators and it is exactly the same. Goodluck with your trades today everyone!

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Thanks, i just backtested it and it looks really creepy... Bsan89, do you really trade with this indicator? It gives so many false entries and misses so many good entries. Can't get it how this indi works

--- 帖子 #712 ---
If you are talking about the "complete" indicator, then yes, thats the one I use. If you run that indicator with the original indicators at the same time, you will see that the arrows are showing on the correct candles as described at the start of this thread. Sure there are false signals, but that is not the arrow indicators fault, this system does have bad signals, like any other system. I think the biggest thing is to try to trade with the trend and you will be fine. The lose I have had have only been when I have traded against the prevailing trend. Can you give me an example of one of the missed good entries and one of the bad entries? Like I said, try compare it with the original indicators at the same time. I have been browsing over my charts quickly, and like I said, the arrows are showing when the rules are met. The only rules that are not part of the arrow indicator are the average daily range, and space to the upper band, but they are very easy to check quickly. Please let me/us know if you do find any big differences! Like I said, I haven't yet, but maybe I am missing something? I would hate to be messing something up! Thanks

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Hoi, I see many beginners here, when you only trade the entry signals without thinking, it is a looser strateghy. Have you thought through what the indicators do? The MAOMAH is based on moovig averages, so it tell you the direction (no chance in sideways,and lag) The ATRband, show you, a possibility that the price can turn. (lag too, when a big move come in, you will lose) The dssbessert, is based on stochastic, and can give you an early entry.(Without S/D zone is only an entry with low success) So what you need to find supply/demand zones, and PA confirmation to enter!!!!!! (price dont lag!) I use nonlagdot, to confirm entry, and I wait 1 timeframe upper a PA confirmation. Plan the trade and trade the plan!!! You need to mark zones where you are waiting for possible entry. Place there a price alert, and you dont need to whach the charts all time. I manage 29 charts at same time!! Whit planning, you can choose, the 3-4-5 best pair, and you only need to wait for the alert, and the trade will come...

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thank you for the valuable information mate, Do you use some indicator for supply and demand levels or manually drawing those.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I do it manually. I will post some examples later.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I'm currently testing on GBPUSD,EURUSD and AUDUSD on 5 min time frame the results seems fair, is there have some other profitable pairs someone tested before

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Many pairs can bee profitable, when it have a right move. To have a pullback, you need to have a clear direction. There are good and bad weeks at all pair, this is because I watch more pairs, an chose the best ones.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Unfortunately today I had no time to trade... Look it on M15, where the setup was formed, and the nice candle on M30, the confirmation.

Greeting FF Traders, I have tried automating this system and from my current experience with using it in a competition(see results below; first trade was manually done using another system and all other trades were the automated bot version of DSS.) This system is one of the most accurate scalping system I have ever used...I made a -$18k lost and essentially have almost recouped the lost in less than 4 days of trading this system on just 8 pairs on the M5 TF mainly. A few observations that may have already been mentioned here already but for the Noobies interested in using this and then abandoning it after 3-6 loses: 1. Always check FF for how many High and Mid impact news are coming for each trading day(if you see more than 20 News reports for the day take a break and go enjoy the sunshine from your trading dungeon) In the competition the few loses you see are in part ignorance on my part for for forgetting to check my fundamentals and that day had over 30 news releases!(even then the system still made pips) 2. Trade with the trend and stick with the trend and you will make money guaranteed...even after loses. 3. Use common sense and exercise constant MM in all your trades...this will further reinforce the above guaranteed wins. 4. Set a realistic TP based on what the average movement of pips(Open-Close) of the last 20 bars has given on whichever TF you choose to trade on and try using this instead as your TP(this might just increase your hit rate and limit your exposure to risk...) set a SL based on the average movement of pips(High-Low) of the last 20 bars has given on whichever TF you choose to trade(this might just decrease your stop rate and limit your exposure to risk...) the Spot market is a fluid thing and is in constant flux. Before you ask any questions, make snarky remarks or scoff at the above...give it a try..nothing beats empirical data &amp; testing...may pips follow you all the way to your bank accounts! - Battousaib
