Don't get me wrong, I like indicators and I love the idea of letting an EA run. I also love scalping 5min charts but what I also really, really enjoy is watching "the perfect trade" set up, taking it and walking away feeling great. If I told you that this trades was a nobrainer and a few more are setting up right now, would you wan't to learn more? Would you be interested in trades which have been proven to be profitable after 20'000 samples over decades?? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Anyone in here know who Thomas Bulkowski is? Who knows what a Adam &amp; Adam Double Bottom is? Who would like to play? I'd be willing to take my time and talk setups every few days if I could get a few people to join and help. Rather than putting together a system using indicators (which by the way all use old data and really don't predict anything), let's use price. let's use patterns, let's trust our eyes rather than a few lines and candles spread all over the place. Who's in? by the way, don't expect me showing you anything under a H1 chart.Daily, H4 and H1's only! Patience and precision!!! EDIT; I've posted an update of the first trading week on the top post of page 33, here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...583604&amp;page=33

Here we go: What you see here is a simple Eve &amp; Eve Double Bottom. Bulkowski says, take the total range (trend high minus trend low) and multipy it by 67% for your TP. NOTE: THIS SHOULD BE 550 PIPS AND 395 PIPS!!!! my bad Attached Image (click to enlarge) More details here: http://thepatternsite.com/aadb.html Attached Image (click to enlarge) An Adam &amp; Adam Double Bottom would look exactly the same, just without a rounded bottom, like this: Attached Image If anyone would like to add anything (obviously not indicators...) please feel free to join!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
We'll be looking at these later! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's a great book for those interested! My current bible! I'd love to not see standard trendlines, Zig-Zags etc but focus more on the great Bulkowski's discoveries! { copyrighted attachment deleted by staff }

No, so many way to trades. The key is to trade paterns, patterns which have proven themselves to trigger a certain trend direction. Some of these patterns are right over 70% of the time. Now of course you are not going to locate 12 patterns a day, but when you do, you willbe able to trade with enorm confidence and have no problem at all walking awqay from your trading room and letting the trade run. Bulkowski analyzed over 30'000 patterns. This is some powerful stuff. BUT it not what a lazy trader will be interested in. This may be me, but I enjoy the hunt much more than the kill. Sure, it's easy and fun to be lazy and watch an EA do the work, but there's nothing more rewarding than getting something done by yourself. the only way you will master your trade is if you practice it yourself. how are you going to learn how the markets work if your EA is doing all the work??? Man, I love Fridays! We got the whole weekend to prepare for Monday!!!!

Here's an outstanding and quite clear flag set up! Flag height: 670 pips Half of height: 335 pips TP on short entry: 335 pips under entry TP on long position: 335 pips over entry SL on long entry: bottom of flag (not flag pole) SL on short position: top of flag In this case the SL's are 310 pips from entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The entry might not get triggred for a few days. Patience! Any questions? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[quote=Shemski;8823903]Here's an outstanding and quite clear flag set up! This doesnt look like flag pattern that I am familiar with. I have had a look through the index of Bulkowski's patterns and I still can't find a good match. Can you please post the text book example of where you recognise this pattern from? Thanks. I though it looked more like a pennant.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
[quote=wizlon32;8823937] Yes, it is shaped more like a pennant. Very true. my bad. Here's your flag: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Or this trade, which I took on the H1 chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #17 ---
You're very generous. Thanks a million.....

--- 帖子 #18 ---
[quote=Shemski;8823943] I'm not trying to be awkward here but I can't see the pattern that you took your GBPAUD trade from. Unless you traded the break of the high of the flag pattern? But in my opinion this is too late. Surely the time to buy with this strategy is on the break of the flag pattern which is probably nearer your SL?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I see a double bottom, and like 2-3 heads and shoulders. I love naked trading.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
[quote=wizlon32;8823956] I placed the pending order yesterday evening GMT. The SL is a bit high because the flag didn't have that dipin it at the time...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Based on the pattern I don't think your SL is high, I was just curious about the entry. Ok so you spotted the pattern and placed your order at above the high? Just to be clear I hope this thread takes off as I think price action / patterns is where we should all start and I am looking forward to learning. And as I said in my first post I am currently trying to move away from indicators and read the chart patterns.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Sure thing bro. Please add some input, charts, thoughts. This thread is also yours!!!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Wiz, thoughts on this? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Without checking it against anything I recognise it as a pennant continuation pattern? And obviously that is how it played out too.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The TP on this trade was 170pips (half of flag pole) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Two smaller trades: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Exactly. Easy money, no indicators. Just your eyes and patterns!

If I'd tell you that a series of four candles in this screenshot tell me that your success rate of taking an order in a certain position is about at 72%, how excited would you be? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Who else see's it?? This should be super easy!! And why is the dashed red line so important? Hint one "3"! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
OK so your vertical green line is the distance from your entry to your TP? What chart pattern are these two? How would you find your entry point?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
This is a flag pattern? No?? My Entry is right above the high. TP's are correct.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I don't see these as flag patterns. These are just pull backs. The TPsmay be correct according to your strategy (half of flag pole) but what is your entry signal? A trend line would probably have given you a couple of trades though.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Really, why would they not be flags? High and Tight Flag all day if you ask me... Entry is right above high (top of flag pole)

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hello everyone, your opinion on this triangle?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Here is my take on a flag. This is AUDCAD H4. It may or may not be a flag - I chose this example quickly to respond. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #34 ---
AUDCAD not GOLD

--- 帖子 #35 ---
What is your opinion from this triangle Darryl?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
That is an Adam and Eve Double Top to me. I would've shorted on the third to last candle, with my TP being; High minus low (right where price is) muliplied by 0.69 (about a 58 pips TP) and my SL would be around 80 pips. BUT, it's history is not the best,so I would lay off of it.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Iam not a big fan of wedges and triangles. Neither of them really perfom great longterm.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
The Adam and Eve Double top is outside of the pattern that i was using as an example. I will find a better one.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
OK, I'm off to bed. Will reply tomorrow. Very, very good convo. Please hang around and continue to contribute!!!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Here is some examples of what I would call a flag (continuation pattern) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
The Double bottom Eve example took 1 month to appear, and almost another month for the trades duration. All for 39.5 pips... Is that normal?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
this thread once giant treasure chest for us to grind. very nice idea sharing here shemski , salute count me in. subscribed, been looking for these sometime and waaalaaaah here is it.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Shemski, I had been trading naked every since technical indicators and expert advisors had given me false hope of profiting for the long term, for my entry and exit I use price action with the news as my indicator on choosing pairs, this strategy had almost won me back all my losses and wasted time.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
No, my bad it was 590 pips and 395 pips. I edited the post.Thanks for pointing that out

--- 帖子 #45 ---
The idea is nothing new. Thousands of traders, if not tens of thousands of traders trade with this style. Bulkowski also did amazing research work. His site is one of the best things that ever happened to me. The longer I look in to it, the least I like the idea of trading with indy's. I'm not saying indicators are evil, I just love the idea of "freeing" myself from them and feeling the market better. Please read through the book and take a look at Bulkowski's site and let me know what you think, which patterns you see forming right now and help me create something special in here! Have a great weekend everyone, let's get ready or Monday!!

Hi Shemski, i like your share my view about flag is right? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Acana, yes I am just not to convinced with the flagpole of that flag. The trade worked out great but the move upwards before the flag started wasn't "violent" enough for my likings. Can you see that morning star on your chart? Jan 19th around 19:00. The morning star followed by that nice drop off! Very nice setup there, very nice!!!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
ok thank alot im trying to understand here

--- 帖子 #50 ---
No problem, did you read the book and go through the site? I'm learning also, so let's help eachother out!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
thank you, im begin to reading now

--- 帖子 #52 ---
This set will take a few days but it could form a very nice Eve &amp; Eve Bottom, not perfect but decent. Again, we might end up waiting a good two weeks for a legit signal but we are looking at 550 pips to the upside. And guess what, 550 pips is right where resistance sits! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Rounding Top anyone? http://thepatternsite.com/roundingtop.html We could get a nice little bounce up. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #54 ---
that is a bull flag - no doubt - but it aint high&amp;tight [high means high vol &amp; tight flag/wedge etc] .... the pole is a Elliot 5-wave [non of the impulse waves qualifies 4 high&amp;tight] - so cause its a bull flag only .... entry is on the break of the upper channel of the flag - if u wanted 2 use limit orders on the bottom channel u may need a grid type entry ..... side notes: how the pole comes about is very important - in this EN H4 trade the entry is right on H4 res and the break of this would have been super cool trade ..... extra side note: it is easier 2 spot a pole in instruments wit gaps [beyond sundays ] ..... another side note: u need to replace 'high' wit someting else in fx

--- 帖子 #55 ---
EN H4 - a few high&amp;tights that didnt work / no entry .... 2nd chart wit pan-back [look left ] ....

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Im naked right now

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I only have two months of forex but i want contribute to this thread so i can learn more.My opinion about that post is: the green line is the SL and the red is the TP. Green line SL why? Because we can see before that buyers reached a point where they couldn't fight the strenght of sellers (right where the green line is) after that we can see a bullish market but in a blink of an eye sellers have pull the price downRed line TP because is where I think this will reverse (i'm new to this so if i'm wrong tell me where is)Ps-thanks for the book

--- 帖子 #58 ---
good try Manel9530 - my guess is he wants Risk:Reward of 1:3 wit [hidden] SL above the pre pivot high to the red dash line

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Nope, Three-Line Strike pattern! http://thepatternsite.com/ThreeLineStrikeBear.html According to the man,the Three Line Strike Pattern acts as a bullish reversal 84% of the time!!! If you go back about 20 candles you will see the same exact pattern, with the same exact result! Why mess around with indy's when allof the information you need is right in front of you??

--- 帖子 #60 ---
The only problem I see with your methodology is that you are trying fit patterns that were designed to be used for trading stocks. The stock market and the forex market are two different animals! I have worked for one of the largest commercial banks in the world and on any given day 80 to 85 percent of the currency transactions were for conducting business, not speculation, not fibo retracements, double tops, etc....... Remember that stocks are not used like currency. When a large corporation in the USA is buying machines made in Germany, they have to exchange dollars for euros. It's really that plain and simple. For the most part they are not concerned about where the price is on a chart, they just want their order(s) filled. (which depending on the size means multiple orders filled)

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Bullish Three Line Strike was at it again! Setting a SL right below the previous lows and your TP at the next resistance level would've netted you a 3:1 R/R ratio! Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the 28th a Bearish Three Line Strike pattern appeared but failed only because of the fed. Damn fed! LOL

--- 帖子 #62 ---
A very wise man has spoken! You are completely correct, but simple patterns like morning stars, head's and shoulder's etc appear and trigger similar moves in both markets. Bulkowski is a stock trader, we allknow that. but a bunch of FX traders also trade naked. Have you ever traded FX with naked charts? If so, what was your experience?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
s ​I only indicator I use on my charts is a single ema, and that is just to get an idea of which side of the fence I want to be on. I also mainly trade off of the weekly charts, sometimes daily, sometimes monthly, but nothing lower than daily. I started trading in the futures markets and my mentor taught me to trade off the weekly charts, so that is where I feel the most comfortable. Also this allows me to do other things. I find that over analyzing things only makes for poor decisions. My best trades were the ones that I just let be. I know that if I was constantly monitoring them I would probably lose confidence in my original decisions and start second guessing myself. This can only lead to failure. I'm in the eastern time zone so I only look at charts on Friday's after 4:30 pm. I review what happened during the week, decide what I want to do for the upcoming week, and on Sunday after 5 pm when the market opens I put in my orders. That's it! I do nothing until the following Friday. That's how I trade. I'm pretty sure it's not for everyone, but it works for me. Also it's pretty stress free!!! Which is nice!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Good stuff, I really like your style of trading! The longer I trade, the more turned off I get from lower TF charts. I'm starting to fall in love with daily charts. Strange, because only six months ago I would've laughed had someone stated I'd be trading daily charts today.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
You have reached a milestone my friend, the biggest step in becoming a successful trader is realizing that patience is a part of maturing. Everybody wants to feel that they are part of some action that doesn't exist, if you want excitement with your money, then go to Vegas, if you want to make money trading, you have to observe the current conditions and then make a decision. I believe you are well on your way!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
my bad - was only look'n @ red dash line .... i spotted that candle pattern at the pivot high but the body of the engulfing candle does not 'engulf' - the last candle [of 3 engulfed] is not black - may b u can point it out so we can learn this - thnx

[textbook ans] the lower entry 4 normal/usual bull flag .... the upper entry 4 high&amp;tight ..... u can use the close [as i have] or the wicks ..... i only use wicks [try 2 ] for limit entries ...... there r problems wit quoting success % .... first u must follow the method/pattern/rule 2 the T - otherwise its meaningless .... another problem is how the study of the data was done - if u search for the historical pattern first and then apply ur SL/TP method dis is a major flaw [as any live trader will tell ya ] .... another problem is that the winning trades may have been bunched up over a short period compared 2 the total history period ... the list of problems are many....

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hello Shemski, I am a bit confused (sorry, I am not trying to be the awkward one in the classroom - I am genuinely interested and want to learn). You are quoting a bullish reversal which is backed up by the link you attached but your example is a short trade. I presume you're example is a bearish reversal using the 3 line strike but I can't find the formation in your chart. Can you please highlight the formation on your chart? Thanks😊

--- 帖子 #74 ---
From Bulkowski's site: The bearish three-line strike candle pattern appears in the red circle on the daily scale. Price forms three black candles, each with lower closes, in a downward price trend. A tall white candle engulfs the price action of the prior three days. The candle acts as a bullish reversal when price breaks out upward , and closes above the top of the candle pattern. http://thepatternsite.com/ThreeLineStrikeBear.html I hope this helped

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I understand the pattern and I see it clearly on Bulkowski's site. I don't see it in your example. Can you please highlight the candles you are referring to in the chart you posted? Thanks

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Green arrow. I have understand that the entire price action of each candle should be engulfed, but the example that i showed you and the exact same patterns over the last 3 years have worked.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I am referring to your 1st example. There is no green arrow.I can see the pattern in your second example with the arrow.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
ok, i'm a bit confused/lost. Could you please repost the pic. I posted quite a few... Thanks

--- 帖子 #79 ---
You only posted 2 3 line strike patterns. I tried to copy and paste your screenshot but it appeared as the link below. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1458373863

Setups / Possible entries I'm looking at: AUDUSD / H4 Rounding Top, looking to sell on the break around 0.7585 USDJPY / H4 Looking to trade pennant breakout EURUSD / H4 Not the nicest, but looking to trade the pennant breakout GBPJPY / H4 Watching closely for one more down canle, then a three strike bull candle AUDJPY / H4 possible 3 strike bull candle soon NZDCAD / H1 Entering a short position due to 3 strike bear candle and a few others, but too tired to post now. I'll keep you posted!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Can I make a suggestion? I think things would run more smoothly if you used chart examples which showed clearly the area of formation that you are talking about. On this example you have arrows all over it and you have a sell trade in play. Please show us exactly the area you want to discuss.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Please ignore those arrows. The indy isn't working. Check tech-forum, I'm trying to get a 3strike alert indy. I was more interested in feedback regarding the pattern. The pennat isn't pretty but a break down could be huuuuuge! Vasily, I've seen you around here a lot and I like your no-BS approach. I'd love to get some creative feedback from you. You seem like the type of trader who could really help me/us out. Our mindsets might not be exactly the same but I love what you bring to the table. Thanks for joining us. Please feel free to be active and hang around!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Sure, this is what I see: 1) extremely choppy over the last few weeks 2) Price coming off resistance 3) A very sharp, pennant forming 4) a SL about 95 points to the upside and a TP around 150-200 to the downside Strategy: -Enter full size position (2% portfolio set at 95 pips SL) -TP half position at 55 pips (resistnace seen there) -Scale out the rest down to (hopefully) 200-220 pips) I do not see a clear pennant, flag or any other type of pattern but maybe someone else does...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
OK, here is my problem. You are seeing a pattern and you are posting the chart..... but those of us who are reading your posts may not see what you are seeing. I think it would be beneficial for us all if you would make it completely clear what you are looking at - tell us what pattern you are seeing and draw some lines to highlight it. EDIT: OK I see you have done this. We must have been typing at the same time.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Here is NZDUSD. I've got my eye on this one. I did take a small short position with hopes of it going back towards the bottom blue line. But will have a tight SL due to the fact that on the longer time frames it is an uptrend, and we are at the bottom of uptrend. ​

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi shemski. Your thread sure is nice. I trade naked chart myself. Eventhough not really a fan of bulkowski but his book did give me some insight. Anyway, back to the topic. What is your entry condition and you filter?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
in this thread we can leanr and teach.ı like your way.naked.that need understanding market. ı dont see arrow.you say clean chart.ı ignore them.there are many many trader here ff taking trade short cus its just having a hh or reverse.ı dont understand that.ı understand they want to have good rr but it make no sense against strong move.in your chart its building a reverse.in this condition when trading such strong move you are wanting 20% max of main move cus strong moves dont make more then that pullback.in this chart it can work for some pip but or more but when this is the trading way then you lose at the end of the game.people prefer this way cus it give them timing.one best trader called here giving advise his other best trader to wait to short amercan central bank up move for one more hour.this is not trading.this is gambling.go play poker have fun and cheaper.drinks free how you find the irection in general,feeling fundamental or chart slope?

On which trade? Please share how you trade, what you look for and where you do your research... I am in the learning process myself! Thanks

I am learning too. Hope you can give me more knowledge in this naked chart trading. Cheers

Shemski's short was obviously taken from a rejection of the resistance line. Do you not agree that this is a viable way to trade? Pity there doesn't appear to be any other chart pattern. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is eurjpy. Notice how resistance has turned into support. I'm not sure if that would be considered a flag or a pennant but a break of that to the upside should net around 200-220 pips. Also looks like a head and shoulders before it broke resistance.​

ok.this is about 700pip zone and you short it at top.what do you think how many times you can cact corect level to short.distortion of 700pip range can be up to 80-100 pip.do you take that amount as a risk?do you think market will stop pip to pip where zone starts or you think.ı am saying in general not this one. this short trade is week chart trade.and week chart trade can make big distortion bigger then you think look at strong 4h bars.ı dotn trade against them make no sense but ı am not pro or expert

this how ı see nu .ı know no indicator but this can be used for one time nu month

--- 帖子 #102 ---
WOW, i was just (literally like two minutes ago) looking at the exact same chart, thinking the same thing. My issue with the pattern is the pole is extremely short and the pennant is long and I also see price hanging out there for a little bit. If price rises and retraces back down from the upper trendline, I might take a half position. Ignore that position, it was triggered based on a completely different system. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But not feeling super confident in the set up.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
This is a great thread, with a great system. I was taught to trade naked using price action and some patterns. Thank's for reminding me. It's too easy to get side tracked in this game, and go in a completely different direction.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Great stuff, please share your thoughts, experience and choice of patterns!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
OK I see what you are saying. I do think that many traders would take the same trade though and so far it has done ok. At the current level there has already been ample opportunity to lock in profits. Looks good to me but I too am no expert.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
​You're right, the pennant pretty long but I have realized in the past is the longer it consolidates and pinches to a point, the move is stronger. Either way, whichever line that breaks, it would net some good pips. And by the looks of it, it should break in the next couple days.

EURCAD H4. Adam and Adam inside a bullish flag? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #118 ---
That flagpole is too short for my liking. I'll lay off for now.

Is it an Adam and Adam?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Could be right. But that could still be within the upper trendline of the flag I drew.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Could it also be classed as a rounding bottom? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #122 ---
using standard candles (I'd recommend using them btw) it looks like an eve / adam bottom, slightly slanted in a bear trend. Too much going on for me there. My guess would for it to continue downwards. A similar move was made last november: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is the reason I went short on NZDUSD. The first chart is a 4 hr. Notice the bar the the red arrow is an inside bar. The next bar went below it and closed. I watched the 1 hr chart which is the second chart. The 4 bars highlighted in yellow is the 4 hr inside bar. When price dropped below that area and closed, which is the bar with the red arrow, that was my signal to short. SL was .6830, TP for half the position is .6630, 1/4 of the position is at .6530 and the other 1/4 will have a trailing stop.

yeah, but be careful though, since we could push higher first to shake out shorts (up to 126.60-80) but then definately going for 122.50.

We are on the same page. What a surprise. But have a feeling that it would push up to 127.8-128.20 enticing people to go long before drive the price downward. Just a thought from newb...

Do you think this would be the best book to buy when it comes to technical analysis? I've been wanting to buy an in depth book on candlesticks and patterns but don't want to order one and its not worth the money.​

--- 帖子 #174 ---
If you want to understand price action then don't buy books on candlestick patterns. It is all about context and learning patterns does not give you context. In my opinion the best books out there are the latest three Al Brooks books on Trading Price Action (Trends, Trading Ranges and Reversals). The titles are a little misleading as there is so much more in each of those books than what you would think. On first read they are heavy for the beginner, but if you stick with them your understanding grows and it becomes quicker. Just my penny-worth...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I would totally advise you to buy it. The book is VERY comprehensive, and it provides indepth examples of how one would go about trading a specific pattern. It tells you why the patterns form, and how to validate/dismiss. The book itself is more than a thousand pages long, but reading it goes by fast (yes, it is THAT well written)

Patience my friend. Once it breaks it should be a little ride to enjoy but not til it breaks. It should be a nice 100 pip move once it does happen but IMO I would only short it. If a person goes long after the break there is a lot of selling pressure that will make it harder to go up. I don't want to be married to one side or the other cause I know that can hurt me but no matter what time frame chart I look at, I see shorts.​

UJ H4 tripple bott currently at support, so I can't see it going lower for now without a push back into 112

Yeah, before you posted that link I had gone on amazon and read the description about it. I'm not the type of guy to buy a book. But I does sound like its worth the money. Actually, I think it will be the first book I ever bought lol. I have books on cd that I listen to but not a real book. Definitely looks like its worth the money. Does it have a lot of visual charts that explain what hes talking about?​

EURJPY H4 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #189 ---
UJ has been in a trading range for a while (see 4hr, daily charts) and has had another strong leg down to the bottom of the recent range. From a pure price action perspective, every breakout attempt (of the trading range) has failed so far. Although I have no opinion on whether the breakout will succeed this time (it must succeed at some point, after all), most breakouts fail and probability says that this attempt will fail too. So expect a short out of the bottom of the range to fail is what I'm saying.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I understand totally where you are coming from. But think of it like this. Notice how price went down those other two time and bounced right back up and then consolidated? I put the line at the bottom of where it consolidated ignoring the spike down. This time price dropped below the line and is consolidating which has went from support to resistance.​

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Absolutely. It's filled with visual charts explaining each pattern (including visual images of what makes or breaks a pattern), as well as plenty visual charts showing hypothetical trades. It's safe to say that it's the most complete (and useful) trading book I've ever purchased. It sure is the only one in my collection that I regularly open to this day for confirmations. It's like my Merriam-Webster for technical analysis

I'll do a little research myself and try to concentrate only on smaller candle patterns like morning stars, three strike patterns etc and post some quality soon!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Here we go! This could be huuuuuuuge!!!! If the newest candle closes below below the first bull candle of this three strike candle, we will not noly have an almost perfect three-strike bear pattern, but also a break of the flag. As you can see I already entered at the bottom of the flag but if this breaks, I will sure add to that position. This is the type of trade, I'd be willing to place half of my bankroll on!

I actually see a nice pennant forming with a 100 pip SL and 260 pips TP to the downside on the D1. Resistance on the top seems to be much stronger than the support below. I might short soon.

that's what I see on EU daily.

Thanks - patterns, both candlesticks and others, reaction to levels etc are IMO the same - you just have to react faster! With its daily range usually ~ 200 pts, all of which is between 9am and 5pm CET, the Dax is IMO the best contract for all European Traders I started Naked Trading way back when I ran my Naked Yen thread several years ago - tried many things since then and am now naked again for trading Dax Regards PS If 1m charts are OK here, I'll post some Dax charts

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Me too, but I decided to take an entry trade anyway with a Standard Lot @ 126.000 short to 125.800 with a 126.080 STOP. It's a Pin Bar candle on the 22:00 candle and I like them a lot. It's a little over 2:1 but not quite 3:1. We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
While I don't have the Fibonacci's up on this EUR/GBP screenshot, I got in after price rose to my entry @ 0.78280 with a STOP @ 0.78040. I also have a 2nd attempt just a little lower @ 0.77920. I also don't show my Target but it's 0.8000. This is based on the higher time frames and the uptrend. Both of these trades are dicey at best what with the news coming up in a few hours and it's 2 trades on the same base pair, but the trend in news is generally good for each of these trades over the past couple of weeks I'll just have to see if they hold up.

That's the thing about trading naked. There is no waiting for the indicators to catch up to price. As long as a person trades smart and uses good money management, the probabilities of succeeding at this are very high.

EJ such an ugly mofo, see if it pushes to 886 fib line it caught decent bid after it sold off right into 50 fib of the last high/low swing. still the sell zone is 126.60-80 area.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
This is against the trend. It will turn in a SL

--- 帖子 #342 ---
guys EURUSD we could be wrong on the direction (short). It's sitting right in the demand zone on H4 + it's almost +-15 pips in the weekly pivot zone. Could go higher this one.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
UJ H4 could push higher still into the supply zone.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
​I agree, right now its almost impossible to see which direction it will go. The best thing to do it sit, wait, and watch until something forms.

EU is neither short nor long. it's enemy unknown now.

that's true I agree with you, still my take is that unless EJ takes out 127+++ we go down to 122.

that japanese bimbo UJ found decent support via 3 bott on daily, just as posted previously.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
​I'm with ya dude. I'm definitely bullish on JPY all the way across the board.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
not sure about triangles on EURGBP, however I see a clear cut wolfe wave setup, push higher still than trigger a sell off. Could be a good trade to take.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
GBP reversal trades going very well.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
not sure about that one though.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
UJ is approaching the monthly open line. Could find resistance there. A bearish engulfing daily candle tomorrow would give us a 3 line strike. If GJ also drops it could develop point 5 of a Wolf Wave. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 161.8 fib of 3 to 4 is potential area for point 5. Green circle is range of point 1 to 2 projected from point 4 - another potential area for point 5.

Well said, 'money management' is key with naked trading as we intend to catch the falling knives. It's more of a contrarian type of trading but does seem to work if you are focused on the correct s/r levels. Great contributions here!

No problem dude. I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
also guys be careful with AN. Inverted H&amp;S on weekly chart. Strong. I got burned shorting it (nasty AN).

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I completely agree. I also think over-evaluating things can cause you to either miss trades or just flat out see the set ups the wrong way. I like to look for a certain pattern and nothing else. For example, I'll scan every single pair on three different charts looking for nothing but possible morning stars, kangaroo tails, etc setups. then place my trades. After that, I'll move on to a different pattern. Heck some entries might completely contradict others but I am going with what I see. Then, I'll evaluate each entry and examine what went wrong or wright. The last thing I want to do is sit in front of a screen, draw twelve lines, move back a few steps and stare at it for a few minutes. I guess you can say I am learning to ride a bike, over time I'll find balance, I'll figure out what works best for me and eventually I'll take trades with an extremely high confidence level, just like riding down a freshly paved street on my bike. Sorta like a second nature I guess you can say. I know this might sound like some crap Mr Miagi told karate kid, but I want to be one with the charts.... Green pips everyone!

--- 帖子 #369 ---
No problem at all my man. I really appreciate the heads up! And I'll be more than happy for you if you trade the other direction in win! Cheers my man. Cheers!!

potential DB top resistance on EUR USD H4 figure this fork describes price action nicely. Today's reaction of EU was muted, I'd expect bears to take charge Wednesday and bring it back to support area near 1060-1080. I can't figure a proper entry on EURUSD but looks like we will push higher now before getting flushed down the drain pipes. I'll be trading this via short EURGBP tmrw. Good luck traders.

Shorted this where the blue arrow is. It was begging to short on the 1 hr so I watched the 5 minute chart looking for a good entry. SL is 25, TP ??? I gotta go see where I'm gonna look for profits now.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I'm sorry if I interfere with your thread , this is my last intervention and I hope it will not disturb you. I would agree with your trading style only and only if you would take your positions in the direction of a trend. In my opinion, you should have a trend defined first, then you can go with chart patterns for entries. This will stack the odds in your favor. I 've seen these kind of patterns in my personal study of market. Bulkowski did not invented the wheel . I don't know the name of these patterns I recognize them from memory, I;ve studied the market so much that I memorized them involuntary. When I see such formation on chart I know intuitively a reversal can take place. What Bulkowski call "continuation pattern" , swing traders call "correction through time". So, I can confirm these patterns work but when you have a trend defined and search these patterns in vicinity of support/resistance , that coincide with the Accumulation/Distribution phases of the market.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Not at all, your comments are very valuable here. I'll look in to that, I just don't want to limit myself to being "only" a trend-trader. Breakouts, bounces, etc are all great to trade. I really like your approach, feel free to keep on posting your style. We are all here to learn from each other! Green pips buddy, green pips!

I know I said I am bearish on this pair but I also say a person can't be married to one side or the other. An open mind is the best thing to have when trading. I took this trade yesterday afternoon (my time). I bought on the break of the triangle and a close above it. I am now waiting for the green line to be broken and will add to my position. ​

--- 帖子 #398 ---
This is also what I see forming...Another triangle. Depending on what a 5 minute or maybe 15 minute chart looks like when price gets close to that top line, I will open add to my position when the line is broke.​

--- 帖子 #428 ---
my take on EJ that it won't push above 127 at all due to UJ inability to push above 50% of it's recent range, yen is also structurally strong post BOJ announcement where they trim down on NIPR. Also EU is mixed, it appears overextended at current levels and compared to GU for instane EU didn't sell off on bad news, so there is still arbitrage here. UJ down, EU-mixed-down that transpires into EJ short trade.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
99 times out of 100 I don't trade any CHF pairs. But if it is going to bounce and go back up I would assume this is sort of what would happen. Based on price action It is not a good idea to go long with this. If anyone is taking smaller long positions they are just trying to Buy on the very low looking for a big return. That lowest area may get tested a couple more times before it does go up, that is even if it does start going back up. I looked at a daily chart and I highlighted that big candle on a daily. That tells me to stay out if I was to go long. Its an indication to me that there may be another day of selling so that's enough to keep me from going long. Then on a daily chart the trend has been down for 4 months (the blue line). The second chart is a 1 hr. I put a couple lines on there... The smaller blue line is the most recent down move showing how strong the shorts have been and the larger blue line is the same line from the daily chart, and the red line is an area of strong support and resistance. The green lines are what I would sort of expect price to do if this area held and it starts going back up.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Knowing that the SNB could potentially wipe out my entire account with one button keeps me away from this pair. It's like playing with fire if you ask me!

ok I'm out. indecision still.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
The trend is DOWN so I am talking for chart patterns that suggest to sell. You are right, it is not a good idea to go long. The only reason to stay out from long entries is that your fight the trend. What is the trend ? Trend is a Money Flow . Imagine this situation : A BUS and a TRAIN. Who is stronger if they collide ? The TRAIN, of course. Same apply to trends in markets. As long as trader remain with the train, at colission points (support/resistances) he have odds to remain alive than to be wipped out. Those you are referring to , who want take smaller long positions, are the cars who want beat the force of train. Be a smart driver, let the train first, it will clear the road for you. Drive on the train traces.

​I totally agree. I look at a chart like its a river and I'm a swimmer. If I'm jumping in a river, I'm going with the current and not against the current. I may be a strong swimmer but if I go against the current, I'm going to get tired and either get out of the river or sink and die. As for what to short right now, I have been short in a couple pairs for a while now and long in another one. I'll go check stuff out and see what I can come up with.

Good stuff. Do you enjoy trading lower TF's over higher?? I'm holding myself back

--- 帖子 #473 ---
The only inconvenient trading lower timeframes is spread . For me, Lower timeframes cand be traded only on major pairs because the spread is lower than crosses. i trade crosses too but on 4h,6h 8h 12h and D timeframes. Below these timeframes price is spiking too much. Major pairs are good to trade on lower timeframes only after London open. 2 hours before London open is too spiky and I do not trade lower timeframes before London open.

I saw that too and I like to trade Pin Bars and give them room past their tail as a stop -- I think it's going long to the top of the immediate range (0.7590). (4 hours later) ... I was WRONG !!! I'm making up for it though ... 15 PIPS @ $40 per ... and counting @ 0.74948.

To all Naked traders who follow this thread. I read almost all the pages from start till now. I read good idea's ,bad idea's But most all of you make it to complicated. People try to reqognize bar patterns and react on that, add Fibo lines or other stuff what you dont need it Learn to read the charts with your eyes and spot the entries or exits. All what you need is 1 trendline,, or when you are an advanced trader you see how many oppurtunities there are in several Forex pairs. You have to deal with losses, that is part of the game but if you follow your plan and have patience you will survive in the market.

pardon me, can you explain to us some of your word. you said that bank trader not use chart, base on your experience as professional on that field. and you also do trade, and you use chart on using a indicator. so whats the use of the indicator and chart? what i mean you already know that actually the transaction happen in this currency exchange(foreign exchange) is heavily not using chart. I want to learn and know what inside your head. thanks before.

I've got a question for you guys. When price isn't moving very much at this time of day when London and US is closed, what crosses trade the best? I usually only look at the major crosses but have an open mind to trading others as well.

I usually have a trade open from NY close or so, i manage it as best as i can I try stick to the plan, trade only the pairs that work with my traits as a trader is how i see it. Right now G/J and E/Cad are the only pairs i'm watching Cheers

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I can see that happening. Once it gets to the trend line just watch price action and take a short when it starts going back down. If I can be at my computer when that happens, I'll be in on that one 158.50 might be a place it will have a little support

Monday looks like it could be a huge day for breakouts. The markets were quite dead on Friday and towards the end of Thursday's session. I still see a lot of tension in the market which could trigger some huge breakouts. That's why I've decided to exploit some pairs which are due to breakout. This is my plan: 1) Locate pairs which have been stuck in a trading zone for at least 30 hours 2) Wait for price to CLOSE about 5-10pips above or below channel 3) Set SL at ca. 75% of trading channel (in order to avoid getting SL'd on spikes 4) Set TP at nearest resistance Some pairs might only allow me to trade a 1:1 RR ratio, others up to 1:4. These are the pairs I will be keeping a close eye on.

Edit: I hope I did not break any rules with this post! Could not find his video. I will take a look again in a bit. My take on the YM July Futures below. The reasoning behind my bullish bias is medium to short term as structure has been taken out in favour of the bulls ( Red lines) The high still to be taken out to maintain a long term bullish bias if red box level is violated it will confirm long term bearish bias This is the 1 hour chart for trend and then waiting for a swing point reversal or reversal pattern on 15 min. I am expecting a little deeper correction to around the 17300's before looking for a long. But I will take an earlier signal by tomorrow EOP. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I think it is still fine as a diamond. Switch to D1 and it is not wide.

It could be a good trade but I'm not willing to take the risk. My guy Bulkowski has this to say about diamond patterns: --- Important Bull Market Results for Diamond Tops Overall performance rank for up/down breakouts (1 is best): 21 out of 23; 7 out of 21 Break even failure rate for up/down breakouts: 10%; 6% Average rise/decline: 27%; 21% Throwback/pullback rate: 59%; 57% Percentage meeting price target for up/down breakouts: 69%; 76% --- The bearish trade looks much better than the bullish so you could be on to something sweet. let me know how it goes!

How are everyone's trades doing today? Yellen threw me a curveball yesterday and wiped out 5% of my profit within about 2 hours. I'm finally bouncing back and have recovered to almost 3% profit. I'm really pushing to be up by 5-7% by the end of the week. My goal is 5% / week but will be satisfied with 10-12% / month. Risking no more than 2% / portfolio. One thing I've learned from baseball is; "When thrown a curveball, stay back and wait! Never get out in front" That worked pretty well yesterday.

I agree with the long term trend, just do not feel very confident entering at these levels. I'm actually short, taking the reversal. I would much rather take a long position after a break through and back up above the support it is sitting on top of. We are trading at 9 month highs. Carefull

Same idea, same strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EN Morning Star on the Daily: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #623 ---
One terminological question if you don't mind: what do you mean by a kangaroo tail? Is it what is also known as a Pin bar or hammer or is there more to it. Second: what do you guys think of Crude? After having formed 2 LH and 3 LL on the 4H chart it looks like last weeks' rallye is fizzling out. I think it's still early to enter, especially before tomorrow's NFP. But a retracement into the 39 area, maybe finishing with a candlestick like Tuesday's pin bar might be interesting

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Or NU could be a flag on the 1h

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Yes a pin bar and kangaroo tail are the same thing. I already shorted Crude and walked away with a pretty decent profit after a losing trade which I entered too early. I say and solid short entry will make you money!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I¡ve just drawn exactly the same pattern on my chart. NU's already gone a long way since Tuesday. However, any entry on a USD pair before tomorrow will be extremely risky. Given the adverse Dollar sentiment any slight miss may slash the last USD longs. On the other hand, a strong NFP can cause a relief rallye. But in any case any previous PA will be irrelevant.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
My issue with that flag is the flagpole. I'm not a big fan of flags with small flagpoles. Are you going to enter?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
BTW, have any of you guys read up on this thread? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...43#post8844343 Man, I can't wait for the OP to update it. This could be really, really powerful!!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
It is a variation of supply and demand... The most powerful way to trade if you can understand it. The long position I had yesterday for the dow was based on an hourly demand level which was between 17316 and 17340 edit: sorry I meant tuesday, yesterdays one was pure fib and price action

Here's my setup. More like a swing trade, hoping for a retrace through top trend line. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I also already made that observation. We did draw our lines differently but it is not that my lines were too elongated and Shemski's were more strictly drawn. Mine were drawn in a manner that fitted the candle formation in to a diamond as per Bulkowski's encyclopidia. By connecting the 2 lower spikes with a straight line as Shenski did, did not compliment the pattern. Anyway I did take the trade last night and managed to take some profit out of it. Attached Image

That's great !

So it was a flag but I got stopped out with my too tight stop loss

Closed out all of my trades. Up 271 pips with a 59.4% win rate. Max profit drawdown is only ca. 1.8% / portfolio. I might possibly raise my position sizes and see if I can add to the humble 2% I put up in 3 full trading days and the Easter hollidays. Any tips from any of you guys? I'm not sure if trading patterns is more profitable than trading single candle stick (morning star, etc).... Thoughts?

UC Daily Chart could form a Kangaroo Tail candle very soon. As you can see, about two weeks agowe had almost the exact same set up. Price bounced back up to a resistance level (upper red line) along with the bearich upper trend line. The next setup (if the Kang.Tail candle forms) will not be as attractive because price might have a hard time breaking that VERY strong bear trend line. The TP would be around 145 pips to the upside while the SL would be around 160. Not the nest R:R ratio but still I trade I will take with a lot of confidence! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

AUD USD shorttime ?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
So, after 3.5 days of normal trading with this trade explorer and the Easter holidays, I've decided to call it a week. As you can see in the trade explorer, my win rate was 62.7% over 75 trades. Not the biggest possible sample but it lines up with what Bulkowski's numbers say. I mainly traded Kangaroo Tails (Pin Bars), Shooting Stars, Morning Stars, Big Shadows and Flags. My most success came from trading Kangaroo Tails. Moving forward, I think I'll try to focus more on the Daily and H4 charts and maybe take a few less trades. I also would like to note that this system / technique is not built for a novice trader. Trading naked demands a feel for price action and some common sense. I also think this trading style could compliment a trader who would like to run an EA or two but still "enjoy" the market and hedge his/her strategies. I highly recommend trying this, as I learned quite a bit over the last 2 weeks. Trading naked allows you to "find a zone". Some of you athletes out there should know what I mean. While in the zone, you tend to remain extremely focused and your surroundings seem to move in slow motion. The fact that the lowest TF I'm trading is H1 obviously helps. I also strongly recommend not trading under H1 because of volatility. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'll add some more comments as the day unfolds and would be very happy to hear from anyone in here who has noticed any flaws or have any sort of feedback. Good luck and green pips everyone!

Hello Shemski, if anybody else hasn't an answer, would you mind to explain the setup you followed. thanks

Kagaroo Tails! All three pairs formed K.Tails at 18:00 GMT. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any other questions?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I googled Kangaroo Tail but found conflicting definitions. Could you please give some more info about it. By the way, the last but two candle in your chart could be considered a K.Tail? thanks

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Pin Tails and Kangaroo Tails: http://tailedbar.com/pin-bars-vs-kangaroo-tails/ Please note that the Kangaroo Tail or Pin Tail candle needs to be bearish after a bullish candle in order to be avalid sign for a bearich reversal and the other way around for a bullish reversal. So the answer to your second question is "no". Because they are not bullish candles. On the following chart you will see three Kangaroo Tail candles. The first is not a true Kangaroo Tail because it is a) bearish after a bearish candle and b) does not have an upper wick. The second and third arrows show two Kangaroo Tails. Using the upper trend line, you'd have a 2.5 :1 R:R on the first green candleand about a 1:1 on the second which would've been met shortly after FOMC.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Here's another very interesting setup: Year to date on the H4 chart, we have seen this almost exact same pattern six times where a much much smaller bearish candle appears after a long bullish candle. Three out of six times a R:R of 3:1 was met. Two other setups also triggered reversals BUT price retraced. Price didn't retrace until after a 1:1 TP target was hit. One was SL's shortly after the entrance. This is what the entries and exits would look like: Attached Image (click to enlarge) These are the three trades which hit TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And these are the three which failed: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Strategy: 1) Enter at open (or as soon as you can get a decent spread) 2) Risk 1% of portfolio with a SL at the top of the bearish reversal candle .80174 3) Set TP at ca. .7973 4) Move SL to breakeven when price hits 1% (at ca. .7994 Good luck and green pips

Shemksi, Do you incorporate multiple time frame analysis or trade on a single time frame? S

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Shemski, this is better than private tutoring. thanks a lot In your opinion if a novice in patterns should choose 2 patterns to start to practice, which ones would you suggest as easiest to spot and manage for a beginner. many thanks againg. Your thread is really giving me the opportunity to make a giant step forward in my trading

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Yes! I always look for s/r and that is easier to spot on higher TFs.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
No problem, first and foremost don't look for a mentor online. 99.99% of them are bogus. As soon as I ask for your money, run!!! LolGreat question but hard to answer. Learn support and resistance then look in to shooting and morning stars, kangaroo tails are also easy to spot. Big shadows also. Read some of Bulkowski's work! You will hear this one million times: "money management is key!" Good luck and feel free to ask anything else.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Any thoughts on this set up, anyone? The uptrend is still intact and that short bearish candle with the huge upper wick tells me that we might be headed south. We are sitting on some support, so if a break south is made, we could be in for a very nice move downwards. I'm still not 100% convinced though. Anyone else? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #653 ---
my opinion ( from newbie )

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Very interesting to see that your chart (most likely not set to GMT) is showing a big shadow candle where my chart is giving a similar signal. At the end of the day, they are both saying the same thing: Bulls tried to push the pair higher but failed!

Mr. Spock just to say the idea of Shemski's thread is to remove all the clutter on the chart and the indicators at the bottom.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Don't bother about the bottom. These are indicators I once experimented with and haven't bothered to take them out since then. I think the important thing is the chart itself, which should be clean enough for your liking

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I know I have hundreds of indicators which I have tried and over the years discarded, I need to make an effort to stop jumping from one to another, so I have decided this is it and over the past few days I have been more successful.

Thanks and even a bigger thanks from a vet like yourself! I'd suggest to read a few books rather than going through this thread.Bulkowski's literature is great and you should have no problem finding other info online regarding candle patterns, trenlines, s/r, etc. Again, I'm not saying that ditching indicators will result to instant cash. It is just a different style of trading and something I think should be mastered before one introduces indicators to his style/strat. And..... drumrole please.... Money management! This system demands a lot of trading confidence and this can be achieved if your risk is low. Just place your trade and let it run or die. Then move on. period.

Very nice! Now, add Hammer Candles as your entries and exit at S/R and you have two very, very nice trades on that chart. See the two below trades, entries at Hammers, exits at S/R. I usually alway set my SL above/below Hammer, risking 1-2% / portfolio. These two tradeswould've netted about 4-5% / portfolio with only 2% risk. Attached Image Cheers

Shemski et-al. Firstly, thanks for replying and the advice. Secondly, and I meant to say in my first post, that not only is this a great thread to learn how to trade 'naked', but its so nice to read 70+ pages where people are keen to help rather than citicise. ... I'm about to re-read the whole thread, taking notes etc and google patterns but may I ask that, for the next few days at least, that posters who contribute photos of set-ups, could they highlight and name the shapes, entries and exits. I ask this because most of the patterns ive googled so far somewhat differ from actual photos? Again, many thanks for your time and energy. I hope it won't be too long before i'll be able to contribute also. Namaste x

Here ya go, read this: http://thepatternsite.com/pennants.html Entries and exits explained here: Compute the height from the start of the price swing (point A in the measure rule figure to the right) to the end of the price swing (B) and then multiply it by the above “percentage meeting price target.” Add it (upward breakouts) to the bottom of the pennant (C) or subtract it (downward breakouts) from the top of the pennant (C) to get the target (D).

it's a bullish wedge, they are supposed to brake upwards, but from what I have seen is they brake down a lot, it's the most unreliable pattern I know of, as they easily can be mistaken for bear flags. what a coincidence, here is a beer flag I'm so funny

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I'd almost consider that a high and tight flag with a "slow" flagpost. See here: http://thepatternsite.com/htf.html I'd prefer to see the downwards move a bit faster.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
In deed!No clear flagpole so I would also consider this to be a bullish wedge! Cheers

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Yes it will stay a bullish wedge until you got a higher high, and Ops! now you have a bear flag instead. this is why they are so unreliable, bear flags doesn't have to have a pole, even if you don't see a pole on the chart you are watching, go up in time frame, and you will see the flag pole., but on a lower time frame, it will just look as a trend down. but then it still would be a bear flag. because note that every flag pole, is a downtrend on a lower time frame. so then what you could do is trade the higher time frame instead.

To be the best quality bear flag, it should also have the flag slanted up. and a bull flag should have the flag pointing down.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I agree, but again I like to see price rise/fall quickly. In order to catch a quick correction or a continuation of trend. When price moves slowly, it "tends" to correct itself or continue to trend slowly.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Yes this view is in relation to the time frame you have in front of you. on a higher time frame where the pole is more clear and long, the drop would seem to be fast. but that is in relation to that time frame. that is right.

I will repeat here what I did many weeks ago on this thread , to Shemski. If you want apply chart pattern succesfully, with odds stacked in your favor, then s earch them in a trend . If you want evolve on the next stair of trading, you should trade only in the direction of the trend . I assure you as along as you trade like majority here on forexfactory - trend and counter trend - you will lose . Trade only with the trend. Don't underestimate the power of risk management strategies, the COVERVING OF POSITION. Stop listening to trolls. There are plenty of trolls here. And in every place. Read carrefully informations and bear in mind : NEVER, NOBODY will present in public his working strategy. If somebody will do that, you should read him very skeptical. How to objectively estabilish the trend you need for spoting these chart patterns ? Simple : use the well known EMA 20 I will post you some text from a scalping book written by Bob Volman. I repeat, these informations are just guidelines that can improve drastically your trading results apllying well-known chart patterns. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Example : Long side : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Short side : Attached Image (click to enlarge) How to not trade : Attached Image (click to enlarge) P.S : There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher. what we can't understand we call nonsense. What we can't read we call gibberish. There is no free will. There are no variables.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Based on the explanations above : SHORT CHF . WHY ? Because we are below down sloping EMA20. Price @ EMA20 potential resistance. Is there any chart pattern ? Yes. Now apply the trading rules that are specific to this chart pattern as Bulkowski said in his book. Do you trade candlestick patterns ? Then search for them respecting the EMA20. Do you trade gartley patterns? Search them according to EMA20, Do you trade, fibonacci ? pitchfork? trendlines, any kind of indicator? Then introduce the EMA20 . There is no magic to EMA20 , only the fact it is well known and used by traders and they think at EMA20 price will tend to turn. Same apply for EMA50 and EMA200.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
I asked about inside bars and Pinocchio bars of you see those and how you trade them if you do because just a while ago, after i saw strong push by bull with Britishpounds and a pin bar pointing to the north ... i then take long position to fell the market. and another question kind sir... do we really need to use stop loss? cheers

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Tradeur, It is the first time I read about pinocchio bar , lol. I never heard about that before. I suppose you are referring to PIN BAR as Pinochio bar. My belief is the time frame does NOT matter. I have said before I say and I will always say until proven contrary to me, the market, fortunately, it is fractalic. I do not refer to Fractals indicator or something of Bill Williams. What it does work on 60m timeframe it work on 40m timeframe, 39m,38m,37,36 .... 1m timeframe. There is no limit. The only difference is the most tradable timeframe . Every trading platform starting from Metatrader 4, Fusion, Thinkorswim, Tradestation and others, have as default timeframe 1m,5m,15,30m,1h,4h,D,W and M . Because of this limitation, all traders who use these platforms will try to adapt to the crowd. Some traders are teached to trade Daily timeframe, others 4h timeframe, others 1h, others 5M . Majority of novice traders are advised to trade Daily timeframe due to "noise" on low timeframes. My belief is there is nothing true here. The only reason a novice trader should trade Daily timeframe is because he will be limited by time to control his emotions. One to three days should pass before he need adjust stoploss or take some trading decision. It is enough time to give him freedom to analyze his trade and take a good decision without the pressure which exist on lower timeframes. So, majority will adapt to default timeframes and that's why on others timeframes , for examples 123m timeframe or 456m or 789m timeframe the setups may have a slow rate of construction but finally they construct same manner like on the default timeframes. It is more convenable for traders who would trade unconventional timeframes , to trade default timeframes because these are the timeframes used by the crowd so there will be more opportunities on these timeframes. There are a lot of traders who trade 15m, a lot of traders who trade 5m too. In fact, traders are teached these 2 timeframes are viable for scalping and that's why the price seem to move short distances in number of pips. I would like to say that the distance of pips doesn't matter for advanced traders. Using position sizing the barrier of "not enough money for large stoploss level to trade higher timeframes" should be voided. One example in this way is the following indicator . It have 2 horizontally lines, One for the entry, other for the stoploss. Type the risk desired in setting, on each trade and then just adjust the horizontal lines for entry and stoploss. Indicator will tell you which lot size to use to lose exactly the risk defined by you : Attached File(s) PositionSizeCalculator.mq4 8 KB | 436 downloads Tradeur, Your green EMA was below red EMA. If you use 2 moving averages, I advise you to wait until the short term EMA cross the long term EMA and only after that you could look for setups. As long as green EMA is below red EMA, traders from different timeframes are agreeing the trend is DOWN. You should follow the trend ! They have more money than you have. Regarding the stoploss, a trade without a stoploss is a lost trade. Do you feel good with larger stoploss ? Then use the position size calculator I have attached above . This way you are sure you will apply correctly the risk:reward and will lose the exactly percent of money if the stoploss is hit. Of course, if you trade on ECN broker, you should take in consideration the comission wich will be very low on higher timeframes.

Ma plaisir Ah, I've forgot.

Great thread Hi guys, I'm trading naked on the D1. There are very few corrections on a daily TF. If i see some down move, i take it and it rarely goes against me. Most people in this world of finance trade on a daily TF. You'll notice if you watch the news or look at any news article or analysis you'll find most of the " professionals" have a daily TF open and nothing else. I think those guys are usually the winners. You have very little drawdown and when you get on say GBPJPY (the beast) that thing will let you ride it until the cows come home. When that pair moves, it hardly stops for anything. Just my two cents

--- 帖子 #765 ---
i am now trading daily or 4 hour chart - looking for entry with 1 hour or sometimes 15 minute chart if prices pointing at the same direction to minimize risk. however yesterday due to my trigger happy fingers... entered on an unconfirmed candle move although price is clearly shouting south move. so now here i am, managing a trade... cut down position after i saw the second long candle rejection... or i called it Pinocchio Bar ( i believe i read it with Pring's book of technical analysis where he coined it like a Pinocchio nose because it's telling a lie of its intent - and modern trader shorten it into "PinBar") okay, please give me your take with my current position kind sirs. Placed a stop loss just below previous swing low. I will place a sell on stop order depending on price behaviour later on. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I think the daily and one hour TF are best for trading forex. There are quite a few issues you have to deal with in forex though. First one being that metatrader is not owned by any broker. This makes for dangerous conditions. The broker say they are here to help you and they are here for you. But the problem is that metatrader is not owned by your broker. They are owned by metaquotes. The first thing you'll want to do is take your signals from MT4, but place orders through the broker owned platform. I'm using oanda at the moment. They have their own platform. I completely stopped putting in orders through MT4 and my trades have greatly improved. Something about MT4 is rigged and should not be used for order placement. So i like your strategy here. The best way to determine the immediate moves is to look for several daily candles in one direction. Depending on the pair, like GBPJPY, you'll have some weeks of movement in one direction. Maybe months. Daily TF are best for determining which way you should be going. The other recommendation i can make is if you like short term trades, Take your bias from the daily and place your orders on a signal from the 1h. This has helped me quite a bit. Any other TF seems a bit random to me and they don't match up to the main trend. GBPUSD will have some data coming on super thursday, and i think that will be the trigger for most speculators. What you do is. Wait for the data to come out and for the daily candle on the day of that data to close. Whichever way it closes will be the true direction. You'll have a few days or weeks to ride it. The daily TF confirms your bias. Hope that helps

Thanks for the golden nuggets spared here as i have said, my bias on this pair is bearish but just experimenting and honing my little knowledge of price action trading. I have learned that in Daily tf when price is nearing key support or resistance area the price will respect that area unless otherwise a very bad or good news just released. in this case, just to confirm my crazy thought awhile ago, based on my little chart time experience (roughly 4 months) that this pair is bound for retrace...right now, it seems key support level is holding and i can see few haramis and rejections, might as well happen sooner than i thought Attached Image (click to enlarge) cheers

on regards with platform issues, i don't really have a clue of what you are saying my friend but i will take your word for that and right now i will call my broker and see if i can trade with their own tradestation. appreciate it much kind sir

You should respect the TP as Bulkowski said according to respective pattern. If you are targeting your own TP you will denaturate the odds of pattern.

Support and resistance are dynamic. It's controlled by banks and can be defined as an area of interest for buying or selling. You'll never find the same area of support or resistance in sync and respected every time it goes there because the market makers make deals all across the board all the time. I would focus more of where price is going rather than where it might stop and turn. You can't pick tops and bottoms because they happen at random. As far as MT4 is concerned, it could be either way. The entire market feels a bit scammy, but that's just it's appearance.

Hello folks - i'm a naked trader too. it's truly the only way to trade. I trade in all timeframes intraday and sometimes they turn into swings right? Basically i take direction from 4hr downwards and generally enter on a 15 min / 5 min / 1 min I trade in the immediate direction- meaning that apart from the obvious support / resistance points then i dont care what happened more than like 4 hours ago and mostly within the last couple of hours. I trade speed bumps if price is moving up then i'm looking to buy on a speed bump with tight stops. vice-versa for selling. I'll just be lurking to see what you come up with but just thought i'd say hello. oh, forgot to say - I don't have profit targets at all - if they run then i'm still in, if they stumble then i'm out.

Seems like you'd be trying to catch a falling knife by buying that one. I'll be watching GBP/USD for a signal to short from this area. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #394 ---
because it made a breakthrough out of support zone correct so kangaroo is not a valid one correct?
