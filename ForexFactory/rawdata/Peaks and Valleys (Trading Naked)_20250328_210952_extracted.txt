Peaks and Valleys (Trading Naked) is nothing new… just a way for you to place your trades in the right direction. Try and follow along and if you have questions, ask me. “The aspects of things that are most important to us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity.” --Prof. Ludwig Wittgenstein Think about this statement for a bit, before you even read what I’m about to write. Forget about forex and just think how many times you overlook the simplest of things in your life. The wheel for instance, where would you be right now had there never been a wheel? You get the idea. Same goes with forex. You look at a chart and it is so familiar to you, are you really looking at it? Are you getting the most important aspects of the chart? If nothing else, what I’m about to write about will help you really notice your chart in its simplest form: naked.

Kevin: I've always enjoyed your posts and journals. This looks interesting; I'll give a thorough re-read later today. You've probably seen this Pring article, but I'll post it here again, so people reading this thread can access it easily. Keep up the good work! Ed

--- 帖子 #3 ---
You seem to test systems quite often. Just curious but do have a staple system you trade?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Good Stuff Kevin. What are you doing with pending orders that are not triggered? Thanks Chris

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hey Ed, Good to hear from you! Appreciate the positive contribution; had never seen that article before, but am well acquainted with the concepts. Always good to get another person's perspective so please give me some feedback later when you get a free moment. Thanks, Kevin Hello acumen, My systems fit my lifestyle. When I'm busy, I trade longer-term. When I can monitor my forex a lot, then I will trade shorter-term. It is true, I have released many trading methodologies knowing that every trader is different. Some are better than others, but a lot of it is relative to trader characteristics. Personally, I prefer simple systems, so that's what I create. My staple system? Truthfully, it doesn't matter to me. I can use them all at once or none at all. It's more about knowing your pair and trading it well IMO. Best of luck, Kevin

Hey Chris, Thanks for stopping by . As higher/lower peaks and valleys appear, I usually just adjust the old orders to the new price locations. Does this make sense? Basically, New peak/valley = cancel old orders and make new ones. Let me know if this still doesn't make sense because I'm not sure if it's clear enough. Thanks, Kevin

--- 帖子 #7 ---
The trade in the PDF is still going. A new valley has formed so I have cancelled old orders and moved stop up to just below the new valley area. I made a new order to be triggered short if my S/L is hit.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks Kevin....that explanation was crystal!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
This is as simple as it gets. I like to work from Dailys and 4hr charts because I work full time. I will throw on some line charts when I get home and give it a whirl on those time frames! Thanks kevin!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Great and simple system once again Kharvell.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks Kevin for the reply.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I like what i see Kharvell... Very easy to spot on the eye. I'll have a look for my longer TF trades.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Kevin, Did you set a buy order at the new peak to go along with your sell order on the new valley? Thanks Chris

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hey Chris, You got it. It's not necessary to do it all the time, but if you want more trades then you got them to take. I personally did set a buy order at the peak you mention. My chart is below, good job Regards, Kevin Hey melpheos, Good to see you man! Let me know if you see anything interesting as I'll be very interested in your input. Thanks, Kevin

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hey Kevin, Sorry for all the questions. Are you placing your orders above/below the actual peak and valley for avg price? Or using the days high or low? For stop losses as well? Thanks for your time! Chris

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I was looking to use this same method for trading a while ago using the line chart. One question though, the line chart only depicts the close right? So what about the high of a candle taking out the peaks high (entering you into the trade), only to retrace and close lower (in which you'd be in the trade), making it look like the peak was never penetrated. I'll post a chart if you don't understand what I'm saying. Great method though.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
kharvell.....so you're using the average price to trade ? is there any particular reason ? how about the min/max price on Oanda ?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
What's up Chris, No worries dude. You gotta learn sometime . My orders are around 3-5 pips above each peak and below each valley for average price. I'm going to talk more about my reasoning later for average price. This should be alright for now. Good luck, Kevin Hey scottymoll, What's up? Appreciate your comments and questions here! This is a good one... If you lose, you lose. I venture to say that 99% of systems WILL FAIL if they have a S/L. How much they fail is what we all strive to minimize. If you were to get a false breakout, you'd be in that direction until your S/L was hit, which case you would trade in the other direction. The beauty with this system is that when you're wrong, you keep getting chances to enter back in the right way. Best of luck, Kevin Hey findcount, Thanks for stopping by and good questions! To be quite honest, it doesn't really matter what you use. It's the concepts that are more important. Higher high's for uptrend, lower low's for downtrend. When you're talking about the 1-hour timeframe graphs won't change THAT much from min/max to average to close. Maybe on the daily or 4-hour charts this would be more of an issue. I'm just putting the ideas out there; feel free to run with them. Kind regards, Kevin

--- 帖子 #19 ---
scottymoll pay attention here So that EUR/JPY trade I was long in from that example got stopped out today and therefore I was also short for a little bit. It was actually one of those scottymoll mentions where it moved below the valley, but then closed back up. No worries though; made 78 pips earlier, lost 20 pips, and am now back long again currently down 9 pips. Also, I have entered long GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. It is these two pairs plus EUR/JPY that I intend to test this system on in this thread. Cheers

--- 帖子 #20 ---
That's a valid point. Price very often hits the same level twice (or more) only to bounce off. Just look at any decent consolidation. In those situations, we would have a trigger every single time because the high/low is invariably higher/lower (as the case may be) than the average or median. What if we were to approach this with a little more caution? Eg.. Find your peak/valley. If it's a peak, find the High that corresponds to that peak. Only enter when price exceeds that High by a certain amount of pips. Where it's a valley, find the Low that corresponds to that valley. Enter short if price has gone a certain number of pips below that low. To illustrate it, you can use a standard candle chart (for your highs/lows) and plot an SMA with a period 1 and method "median" to help you find those peaks and valleys. Yes, we'd lose some pips but we woulnd't be getting caught out on every single range..... Just my 1.5 pips Lighty ps. I even have an idea for some names. What if we were to call those Peaks "Resistance" and those Valleys "Support"?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Or if you use MT4, it gives you the high and low for each candle even on a line chart. Chris

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Thought I'd jump in and contribute. I like to use the Fib tool in MT4 when trying to gauge price projections and market rhythm. For those interested in the modified settings for the fib tool: Levels - 0, .5, 1,-1, 2 note: if you'd like the price to show at the end of the fib lines (as shown in the picture) just ad "%$" on the description column at the end of every level. So here's the deal. If in an upward trend, you measure last peak to last valley. The highest line up becomes a price projection. I always close at that point. If price overshoots the target, I qualify it as an over-extension... and start looking for shorting opportunities. Let me know if I need to clarify anything. Peace, MM

--- 帖子 #23 ---
thank you, kharvell...........by the way, i'm surprised an advanced trader like yourself uses oanda .........i've heard so many veterans criticize oanda for being too 'basic'...........but i like them a lot becoz i can't even handle MT4 demos........ by the way, how come i don't see you over at oanda's forum ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
hi, i also noticed the eur/usd bounced off 3 fib levels around 1.4315 / 1.4353 / 1.4378 but it also seems that prices are in a downward channel at the moment and could be a retest of the head &amp; shoulders neckline. kindly correct me if i'm wrong ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Sorry findcount, but I don't trade that pair. I just pulled up any chart to show what my Fib tool looks like, and my setups. I day trade so I try not to over analyze the current market situation. I'm just used to my set ups... when I see them I react. I hope this helps... but I guess it doesn't really answer your question. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Findcount, I just pulled up the chart... didn't even realize it was a daily ( I'm typically looking @5's. At any rate, there are two options that I see here. 1. for those with balls: go long now to 1.4630 area. 2. for the more conservative types: go short at 1.4630 area. These are not "free forex signals" just the way I see it. Price will travel back to the .50 level, and more than likely bounce back south to retest 1.43. Hoping this made sense. MM edit: in other words, if this were a 5 min chart... I would be thinking along those lines (in terms of price action)

--- 帖子 #27 ---
This is what i see

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hey guys, A lot of great questions, comments, and contributions. Keep it up! Unfortunately, I've got work today, so I will not be able to respond to them all until I get home later this evening. I'll try to get to answering as soon as possible. Meantime, it's a good time for trading this method. Still long GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, and EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
That's right folks the truth (price action) shall set you free (of indicators)! Kevin, you are a man after my own trading heart...lol This is so very similar to my trading methodology it isn't even funny. Attached is a current trade I am in now with arrows indicating the bars that gave me my entry. No indicators just price baby that's the way to play it...IMHO Thanks for posting your system. Trader_V

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Quick screenshot on GBPUSD on a demo account. This is not what i have taken as i'm just testing right now. Potential 550 pips - 1 loss Edit : i just saw that i forgot several trade during the downtrend and uptrend so in fact that is much more than 550 pips... (probably around 800...) Kharvell, you said that you wont put TP but when do you close the trade ? (i have my own strategy that is a two lot with TP @ 30 for 1 lot and let the other run )

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hey Lighty, Good of you to stop by! Great post. In fact, you have just about convinced me to use candles instead of lines. Perhaps that is what I will use from now on... and LOL on your PS. Call them whatever you want, as long as we all know what we're talking about Best of luck, Kevin Hey MM, Nice contribution here, thanks! I'm a little hesitant to add more indicators to a method that can very well stand on its own. In a sense, if there are fib areas of support/resistance, then they are already taken into account because we use support/resistance in the method. On the same token however, continue to look into it and get back to us if you find the mecca of pips . Thanks, Kevin Hey findcount, Oanda IS too basic . I have a mac that doesn't run windows and thus no hope of ever running MT4 charting packages. It's not by choice that I use Oanda. Although at this point given a choice between the two, I may as well stick to Oanda. Using Oanda has allowed me to develop the simple methods I have, and for that I am grateful. Oanda's forums just don't have that atmosphere that I like around here.. Final verdict: Oanda, good for broker, bad for charts. Hello Trader V, Appreciate the nice post. You mention that you are trading very similarly. What are you doing differently that I should maybe ponder about ? Look forward to hearing from you in the future. Thanks, Kevin melpheos, You're a good man with good ideas my friend . My trades are closed when my S/L is hit. I think that if you are going to use two lots, one lot should have the T/P of the other's S/L. Does this make sense? So, if we are using 50 pips S/L, I would use 50 pip T/P on one lot. This creates the scenario of losing 50% of trades but still coming out breakeven. The downside is that all losses would be doubled assuming T/P is never hit. The reason why I don't like T/P's is a reason that every trader should decide for themselves. There's a fine line between finite and infinite in forex. Who knows whether you could enter a long trade, and you never have to leave it. A homerun if you will. That's what I like, homeruns. I would normally say T/P's rule out homeruns, but if you use 2 lots then you still have a chance. Great comments, Kevin

Hey Melph, Are the blue and red dots some sort of Fractal Indicator? Thanks! Chris

--- 帖子 #33 ---
lol i dont use LINE CHARTS -- NEVER. The same 4 candles. I use only highs and lows on bar charts + time factor.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes that the same thing, so sometime they will repaint on the 5th candle of the pattern so you allway have to wait the end of the 5th candle to make sure that the line will stays on. Look for barry support and resistance indicator (but in any case it's totally based on fractal ) Working with zigzag should do the same job but with more repainting. Anyway, the idea is just to pick up peaks and valley but i'm too lazy ^^

--- 帖子 #35 ---
kharvell, good post....I have been trading this way for over 10 years and I agree that TP will ruin a good trade. I always let them run as far as they will....sometimes not very far sometimes a LONG way...like my EUR/USD long from 1.4414 and my short USD/CHF from 1.1513 I use a fractal with a minimum strength of 3 on either side and trail it with a stop until it gets stopped out....I have found a trailing method that works very very well...shoot me a message if you are interested in chatting about it Once again price trading trumps all indicator based systems because they deal with history, not the present Keep up the great work of making folks think

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hey Kevin, Have you considered looking into an intel based mac? Parallels is about the coolest program ever. I can run Win2000 or XP or Vista in the background of OSX which lets me run Accucharts and Metatrader in OSX. I too use Oanda for broker and not for charting. Accucharts from FXSol is quite nice too. If you have an intel based mac, go run and spend the 70 bucks to get Parallels.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Just a quick test on 4H. There is a bit more on the chart than the necessary for this method but i'm just testing here. Each green box gives a minimum of 30 pips. Red box, are losses... losses ? no. Loss because there is only ONE losing trade here... 33 trades, 1 looser... Success rate on this pair in 2 and 1/2 month 97%... and a minimum of 900 pips gain (for sure much more depending on the exit strategy ) edit : made a mistake on the 16th, it is a loser.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi, but when do u know that is the moment to exit the trade?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks for this method Kevin. Makes me wonder why i've been using those mathematically manipulated monsters called indicators.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Could you elaborate more about your trailing stop? For me, im trailing stop the last 2 opposite fractal but sometimes the stoploss are big.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Good question. That is why i said that each move gave a minimum of 30 pips. I personnaly have a strategy implying a minimum of 2 lots (or 2 .1 lots ) with a TP of 30 on the first lot. Once reached, you set to BE the 2nd lot and you let the other lot run with either a TS or following the peaks or following any other TS trategy.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
One trade rolling now (demo i need to train and it's new year's eve isn't it ? ) Peaks and valley seems to rock. I think i'll work some time on this and have it with the sexy stoch as backup for longer term. Sexy stoch are not very good for long term (to my point of view, Boxingislife will probably contredict this ^^ ) and Peaks and valley are not very good for lowest time frame ( very time consuming but Kharvell will probably contredict this ^^ )

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hey longhornxtreme, From Austin are you? I'm from the Dallas area myself. I do have an intel based mac and such but A) I wasn't aware that you could get parallels for only $70!!! I thought windows would be much more expensive no? and B) At this point in my trading, it's no big deal. I've learned to adapt to simplicity and honestly it's preferred. Thanks for mentioning this though. Certainly good to know in the future the next time I'm at the Apple store. Regards, Kevin Hey drayco, Thanks for the nice words, man! Price should always be the leading indicator IMO, but I also realize that people see things differently. Many think there is only one way to trade: theirs, but the truth of the matter is that different methods will suit people differently. Best of luck, Kevin Hey melpheos, First of all, your backtesting results look impressive! Thanks for sharing the #'s with us. I have begun using the 3-hour chart as well in order to accommodate my recently busier schedule, and it works similarly to the 1-hour. Not sure what you mean here by P&amp;V not being good on lowest timeframe. Do you mean 5-second, or 1 minute or 1 hour or anywhere in between?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Kevin, Fort Worth suburb, here. Close to the airport.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Well then, my apologies about my poor maintenance around here. Many expressed concerns about line chart vs candle charts. My solution is simple. Use both. I now use a candlestick chart with a 1 period SMA over it so I can determine peaks and valleys and the associated high's/low's with them. Made two entries here on my 3 hour chart. They're not exactly by the book entries as I didn't wait til the close of each 3-hour candles, but hey as long as I end up positive.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi, Kharvell Just for the fun.. I appreciate vey much your very good thread. I live in Paris (France) and when I was a child (a long time ago) I always dreamed to be a cow-boy (Pecos Bill if I remember) and ride a horse through Texas country side.. perhaps this year ??? Why not ! Keep going and as a sailor (yes, eventually I became a sea wanderer) I wish you "Good Wind" BBF

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I feel this strategy is great by placing stop order like you advised so the shorter the TF, the faster you will have to put your stop orders and deleting the previous ones. M15 should still be ok for a human but M5 requires an EA or a lot of screening time which is not really what we want

--- 帖子 #48 ---
kevin, Happy New Year ! I am a true fan of yours. Thanks for posting I really appreciate your ideas and your ability to share your thoughts with us at FF. I never knew you were from Texas also. Take care! Bluemonkey

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hey Kevin, I went to UT, but I'm at law school in Ft Worth now. Parallels itself is $70ish, but you're right, the real expense is the windows disc. However, if you can find a copy of win2000, it does not have all the activation junk that XP or Vista has. Even if I had to pay a couple of hundred bucks, I think it's very much worth it.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Kevin - Just curious....how did that "Pip Farming" experiment turn out? Weren't you up something like a billion pips in cable at one point? None-the-less......thank you for pointing the obvious out. I do not mean that as an insult or slight at all. The obvious is what us traders tend to overlook. As soon as I threw away indicators, I began to make money. Amazing isn't it? I once traded using a 34 EMA envelope. It lied. A lot. But it always looks so pretty when you pull it up. Look how wonderfully the price just bounces off of it? Raghee Horner is going to make me rich....or so I thought. Turns out, those moving averages are mainly there to make me feel better. They don't actually do anything. Nothing at all. I supose you make an argument for things like a 200 SMA on the daily.....just because there are former equities traders in the game, but it doesn't matter. The only thing that truly matters is if price is going up, or down. Sometimes it even goes sideways. When it goes sideways, we take notice. (As I love breakout trading.) However, this "radical" idea of peaks and valleys, is probably 1 of only about 3 things you need in Forex to make money. The other being support and resistance, and money management. It's really that simple. Thank you for pointing that out for so many others. Not nearly enough traders keep it simple. Clockwork

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Blackfeet, Thanks for the nice words and stopping by. I went to Paris last summer for my first time out of the US, and it is a beautiful city if only my French were any good . I've ridden my share of horses, but now I'm civilized "Good Wind" to you as well sailor, happy new year, and many pips to you! Kevin To be honest, I haven't looked too much into timeframes smaller than 1 hour trading naked since I don't have the time, but I think you would be right that it could work on several different time frames, and would probably be an easy EA for someone. This is definitely good to know in the future if I ever want to get into those TF's. Thanks, Kevin Bluemonkey, Cheers! Have a great New Year, and thanks for the kind words. Good to see another Texan Kevin Hey longhornxtreme, That's what I figured.. I'll probably give in one of these days and get it Thanks, Kevin Hey clockwork, Pip farming turned out pretty nicely, although I never really tried it again. At one point I was up a little over 2000 pips, but I only walked out with 1500. I think it was a good idea, but at some point you need to move your stops and protect your profits. No offense taken. I'm not a genius, pretty good at math, but not a genius. The good thing is you don't have to be to trade. You just have to realize your circumstances and trade accordingly. It took me a while to realize simple is better, but I got there eventually. At some point, most traders will realize, your indicators just make more noise, and the only possibilities in forex are as you say: up, down, and sideways. It's the extent in each direction that throws people off. Being thrown off is ok, it's just a matter of getting back on in the right direction. Nice post and Happy new year, Kevin

--- 帖子 #52 ---
kevin, hey.....this valley and peak......isn't it basically what's being called the simple breakout ? will it work better if it's based on fractals or no difference at all ? maybe it's safer if we incorporate the 1-2-3 reversal ? well....what do i know ? i like this a lot......for all we know, we were just over-complicating things for ourselves with all the indicators and everything.........heck, i'm not even smart enough to use indicators ! they may my eyes see stars and my brain swim ! many thanks and very happy and prosperous new year........

--- 帖子 #53 ---
hi melpheos where did you get this indicator from? thanks guess

--- 帖子 #54 ---
look above it has been asked and responded allready

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hey findcount, Good questions here, thanks for stopping by! Right you are about peaks and valleys and simple break outs being essentially the same thing. I hesitate in adding patterns such as 1-2-3, and double tops and bottoms and such. IMO, the more you try to standardize forex, the more you will lose. All you really should be looking for is higher high's and low's for uptrend and lower high's and low's for downtrend. If neither of these conditions are met, you've got a sideways market. The way I have laid out the blueprint, you essentially are entering whenever higher high's or low's or lower high's and lows are being created. Thus, the breakout as you might call it. Fractals are unfortunately not part of my expertise, and might be a better question for one of the other members here. I'm not necessarily aware of the differences between fractals and the support/resistance we are seeking. Hope this helps, Kevin

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Kharvell. Thank you for sharing your method. I like "simple" things in trading but i have to admit that most of my trading so far have been more complicated and for the most part by the help of indicators. I hope to get away from that some day... Here is another similar system that can maybe be of some help: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=39972 Arctic4x

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hey Arctic4x, Thanks for posting! It looks like jest found out simple is good a long time ago and we all failed to notice! Thank you for bringing up this resource. I believe it works toward the common goal here: to keep it simple, and you are quite right about the similarities! Best of luck in your simplification endeavors Kevin

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Below are 3 short orders set for GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, and EUR/JPY, based on the 3-hour chart recent valley/support. Just my EUR/JPY chart below as they all look pretty similar.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
kharvell, many thanks for your reply.......come to think of it, fractals or not make not much if any difference after all.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I made 167 pips in total today on a 10 mins move on GBP/JPY and Eur/JPY at 2.20pm GMT. Thanks Kharvell for this simple strategy.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hey dude, Nice job! Keep up the good work Kevin I just got one trade today while I was at work and am up 190 pips in EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hey Kevin, Nice thread! I'm in Plano.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Kevin, so by your rules, do you enter the trade once a candle breaks support/resistance by 3 pips even though the candle has not closed?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
He uses stop orders so if the price is reached, the order activates... Allways use stop order with this strategy (and whats great with stop orders it that you just set them and they activate or not ) If you use a trade manager EA combined with this system, i firmly beleive one should be profitable with this strategy (only loosing in ranging market but much less than other strategies ) Edit : still demoing with peaks and valley, i kinda fucked up the entries but the idea is here (the latest entry in sell is yesterday lowest valley ) BTW Kharvell, as you have more training than me, what is your advice when peak or valley are close to each other ?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hello hnic, I'm actually from Plano also. Seems to be a few more Dallas traders around here than I thought Anyway, I see melpheos answered your question so you should be all set. For the record, the 3 pip cushion isn't the most important thing in the world. I usually just use anywhere from 3-9 pips depending on the pair, but if you're in that window, it's all good. Best of luck, Kevin Hey melpheos, Personally, I just use the most recent peak/valley. No particular reason for this other than I am most interested in the present. "There's no time like the present." If there's a resistance/support area, you could play it safe and place your orders outside and it may save your from a bad trade or two, but then your entry may be worse. You could probably go either way on this one Kevin

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Easy pips, no indicators.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I'm very confident on the fact that you should allways use a TP... Here are the previous trades. The first one went to +60 and the second one to +30. Setting a TP of 30 on both of them would have been rewarding (i did not did so as it is just a demo account and i'm just playing with this stategy right now )

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hey Melpheos, I would like to offer my opinion as to why I disagree with the TP. When you limit your profit potential you are forcing yourself into a position where you have to be right much more. Everyone seems to get to caught up in these 30 pip moves. I personally don't even think twice about 30 pips...that is nothing but noise.....this style is designed to be a trend following method, not scalping. We all must learn to just put the trade on ...use the prior peak or valley ( on 1hr or greater charts) and simply leave it alone. the trades will work themselves out if we don't fiddle around with them. We must accept this method for what it is, a 45-55% accurate trend following method. It will get you in trades with low risk/ high reward opportunities if we simply let it work it will produce profits like these in the picture shown. I find that the more I try pick an arbitrary point and say "this is where the market is going" the more that the market tries to proves me wrong. Just my 2cents worth

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Please read my previous posts. There is one good reason to put a TP but only when you use at least .2 lots. You place a TP of 30 on one and set to BE when the first TP is reached. With this strategy, you are allmost garanteed part of the profit and no loss and you still keep the unlimited potential on your 2nd order.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I agree with the TP if you are trading multiple lots and are going to let one go in a trend following mode.....that makes perfect sense.....I just notice that a lot of folks are taking their profits when there is so much more to be had.......this is a great trend following method and if you take one and let the other go, then I agree that is a valid strategy Many Pips to One and All

--- 帖子 #71 ---
We should do coffee 1 day.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I agree that TP should be used with this strategy but in certain circumstances e.g. when trading multiple lots, when you have open positions while you goto sleep or away at work. On Tuesday I missed 130 pips on GBP/JPY because I didnt set a TP and just left it running and it came back and hit the SL while I was alseep. Anyway I am trading live and its been awsome so far.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Sweet! Thanks for sharing your method Kharvell. I will give this a go for sure.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi kharvell, Apologies if you have already answered this somewhere (i haven't found it after reading the thread to date) - in this cable example, would you set an order on the break of candle 1 or 2? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
My order was triggered at 1.9830 and now stopped out. I also got stopped on G/Y and I am hanging on to E/U by a thread at the moment. Oh well.....Big news days are tough as we all know. Chris

Nice thread Kevin... Trading doesn't have to be hard... the more naked, the more fun.. Leverage and overtrading kills most traders (I was guilty of that myself). Discipline, psyche and market adjusting system is what imho is the survival key in this business.. Lets take a live example below. I know someone who trades that way, so numbers are very close... Say mr x had a $1000 test account and found your very nice thread on FF, and decided put it to a test ( made a system out of your ideas ). He's new to trading and doesn't know much about MM, so he decided to trade 1 mini/per trade and keeps on adding 10k if market goes in his direction. He picks yen and buys it (sells pound) when it breaks 226.60. He then sells another 10k at 223.45, another at 221.45 again at 216.50 ... and 215.18... Then he realizes, G... it's Friday, I better close my all positions before the weekend, and he does that around 214... Then he runs a report from Dec 27 to Jan 5 and realizes he made over 3300pips combined in just little more than a week.... that's a nice % increase on his small live test account. Enjoy the weekend everyone...

Hey Raczekfx, who is this mystery man with the system that you are talking about?? You don't really expect us to believe that this mystery man would really sell the break at every level like that and just keep adding until it gave him a reason to get out.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Sorry man..., I can't tell you since I don't have his permission.... ... but I can assure you, he reads this forum from time to time and maybe one day he'll drop in.... I understand that adding to a trade is not very common idea. Most traders are scalping or have targets( that would include me sometimes ) of 50, 100, 200ps, but imho it's rather a straggle then real trading...

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hey raczek, is that the standard avg price line chart in MT4? Thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Maybe I'm not following too well, but how do you tell when there is a reversal of that loooong down trend?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
this system is a simple trend following system that cuts losses short and lets profits run. As with all trend following techniques, It will draw down during consolidation and will have more losses than wins so expect some psychologically tough times and extended losing periods. Its strength however, lies in its built in pyramiding. By adding to winning positions, the trends that come along will wipe the floor with the losses. Other advantages are that - simple rules to follow - you will always be in positions, satisfying the desire to trade - entries are done with pending stop orders so no need to constantly watch the screen waiting for signals - You will always be trading in the direction of the the market rather than against Nicely done Kharvell

Alright guys, a lot of good posts.. If I don't address yours, I still like you, you just didn't ask me a question . First point of mine is to talk about how I'm not going to use T/P's, and that's just me. I won't say that it is bad, just that I won't do it. That's all as far as that goes. Hey ChowClown, Probably the one closest to the line peak. So in your instance, it would be 1. I have to agree with swingtrader65 though that a lot of people focus on too small amount of pips. To be honest, 30 pip difference may be big to some of you, but when we're talking about 1000's total, I'm not too concerned about those 30. So in essence, 1 or 2, it doesn't matter just get in the trend, and if you lose, keep trying. Best of luck, Kevin Hey Chris, I had some losers towards the end, too. Just keep at it and you will win in the end. I'm ending up with 450 pips or so though so it's making up for any losses. Good luck, Kevin raczekfx, Good news about your friend! Tell him congrats for me. Also, tell him he's lucky and to enjoy the good times while they last . Adding to positions during trends expands your gains, just use wisely. Regards, Kevin Hey M.A.C. Doug, You hit the nail on the head here, good post! These are the reasons this method can and does work. Anyone can do it Good luck and thanks for stopping by, Kevin

Sounds like a professional trader..maybe a former bank trader..I hope to be able to trade that way with confidence soon.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
excellent thread! great stuff! would you sonsider a fractal or similar indicator to determine peaks and valleys? just curious if it may be easier than eyeing them up in real time? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #85 ---
read the whole trade, that is exactly what i'm doing

kharvell, very nice. simple, effective, lucrative.

Hi Kevin Looks simple and effective, will start trading it this week on 4H. Thanks for the great advice.

I'll keep that in mind.. many pips Kevin.

hello Raczekfx, It is possible to give you templates for your chart?? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I have used a 1 bar sma H (green) &amp; a 1 bar sma L (red) (with the candles blacked out) to show the actual highest &amp; lowest points. I have also edited post 010708, to show a similar display but with the candles in place. Regards, BabeFX.

hi elfural, I don't have a template handy, but hope this doc will help you.. Best,

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hey Racze, Just wondering if you have a reason for using the close &amp; not the h,l/2. I have played with both &amp; also the line setting instead of bars. The line seems to be allmost the same as hl/2 but the close setting is quite different. Do you find this allows better placing of buy/sell stops? just like to know your reasoning, or is it just personel preference? I haven't traded using this alone but am adding it to my pa, s/r method. I do think it adds another way of looking at charts &amp; still being naked. (my charts are getting more naked every week) its just sooo less confusing. Thanks Jeff

--- 帖子 #93 ---
hello Raczekfx, Many many thanks

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hey Jeff, I haven’t had too many trades with this method since I still like my PA with fibs, tls and confluence, so you would be better of asking Kevin for detail settings. But to be honest I don’t think it really matters if you’re a break out trader using daily and higher timeframe.. Best, Welcome elfural..

--- 帖子 #95 ---
True, Similar to you looking at finding a way to help me sit on my hands a bit, so to stay in the trade longer &amp; add to it. Thanks Rac.

There's been some talk of pyramiding positions here, and I wanted to throw out an idea of mine for good entry schemes in order to achieve maximum pips by pyramiding. The idea is to wait for a trend to develop on your 4-hour(3-hour) chart. Then get on your 1-hour chart and get some nice entries. Look at this post Christmas example of EUR/USD. On the 3-hour chart, an uptrend just formed. It looks pretty nice and it's pretty obvious what's happening. Then zoom to the 1-hour chart and look at the nice entries you would have. Of course this is an ideal example, but pyramid away if you can Also, if you can stay around a while, why not 30 minute entries, or possibly even 15-minute. You would only want to trade with the trend assuming it is strong, you would do pretty well with multiple positions focusing on one or two pairs. Personally, I don't have time for this, but I'm just throwing it out there. Another thing, applying the strong trend filter, that is waiting for a trend to develop, could result in higher probability trades if we were just to trade as normal without multiple timeframes except only with the most recent strong trend. Best of luck, Kevin PS. Don't PM me about indicators that would filter out bad trades! What is my thread called?!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
How about adding a nonlamag or a MACD or a RSI or several MA or.... I'm kiddin'

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I have been testing this method today... it is great!!! 1 hour time frame... pips in... did around 4/5 trades or so, I love this system... for me... I like to day trade a little... tight stops, I use around 15+spread (lets say 20) TP 50... the market will break either way and you'll be 10pips in the plus! Yuppie, if not more... It has worked for me today... have to carry on testing throughout this week. This is the best system by far!!! This takes out all the emotion in trading! Set and forget system! Happy Pipping.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hey guess, I'm a little unsure if you got 4 wins using your 2:1 Reward to Risk TP and S/L or you used it the normal way. If one must set a T/P, then I agree it should be greater than 2:1 R:R. However, I'm content with riding the trends. To be honest, this is where the pips are at. Setting T/P IMO limits pips. Sure you get more now and you guarantee small profits and blah blah, but wasn't there an old saying about the tortoise beating the hare At any rate, I've tried it both ways, just giving you my opinions.. Thanks for stopping by and let me know how your testing goes, Kevin

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Kharvell, Sorry I didn't get 4 wins on that ratio... I closed them off early, though if I had seen the trades through, they hit my TP. I was like :O and I would have got those rewards. Though it is looking good... simple... don't need to spend too much screen time... though I do cheat a little I am indicators on long term charts 4hr and 1day to see where the trend is going, just to help me... see if there is a retracement, if it is trending... etc... but I'll keep you posted on how get a long... Thanks for opening my eyes... I am really surprised there has not been many people onto this thread... I am pretty new to forex, compared to a lot of you and I have realised, you can use indicators, but you have to look a price action on all time frames... i have found one thing... yes you look at the bigger picture... but the smaller picture is building the bigger picture. Anyways... gotta go.. Guess

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Kevin, Firstly thanks for the thread. I was wondering what your thoughts were on just trading in line with the trend? i.e, daily, say using a mav of 24 and only taking trades in the direction of that. You have obviously put a lot of thought into this I'm guessing by your no TP policy . I was thinking this would cut out false trades? Regards, Bogus

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Will it break up or down??

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I'm betting on down, because it reached this consolidation range from above. But I wouldn't put too much [on this bet] just yet... Also, looking on higher tfs, this seems to be the direction - though it's approaching support.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
with the carry trade/equities correlation, there is also some fundamental support for a downward break with the current recession fears. It may take a while and is probably going to be messy with lots of volatility but these levels holding as support is unlikely. A break will target 700 - 1000 pips longer term I believe

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Ive been going over a few pairs I've been watching today; g/j,a/u,n/u,e/j,c/y. Just on those pairs, going against the 3 day trend, would have been a great haul. For me, the stop and reverse is something I am going to have to get my head around. Back to testing.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I initiated first long position on Sunday at market open in e/j, g/j, u/j, c/j and a/j. These are some of my long entry triggers on u/j and g/j, last arrow is still waiting...., still have half positions running...

--- 帖子 #112 ---
second pos. long on yen crosses stopped out and reversed. Still kind of testing this concept as a potential additional nice tool to complement j16 PA. Once again xx/chfs were leaders and xx/jpys followers today...

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hey bogus, You're doing awesome man! Keep up the good work I want to address a thing or two about the above question and also trading in general. First of all, what about sideways? Have you forgotten sideways already? This is very important. If there is a sideways trend, why would you care if it has broken one way or the other? You should probably be watching on the sidelines, because we like trends (at least I do), not sideways markets. Second, predictions are for fortune tellers and mystics. If you could predict forex, you should be able to retire in a couple of weeks. These are key questions to ask yourself before you place the trades: How often do I want to enter? (What's my timeframe?) What's the trend RIGHT NOW FOR MY TIMEFRAME? (Up, Down, SIDEWAYS) Do I want to take this trade? Basically, I am more interested in the present situation to my applicable circumstances rather than predictions. The present is more reliable than the future.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks Kharvell, Fair call.You're right, I'm no fortune teller. I'll ask myself those questions. Cheers

--- 帖子 #115 ---
That quick test you did with the 30 pip target looked interesting but It looked like it had no stop and some trades drewdown quite a bit before reaching the target. I tried it over 4 months with a 63 pip stop (including spread)trading each swing break (not fractal). I achieved an 82% hit rate and a profit factor of 2.2 returning 1278 pips. biggest winning streak was 12 and max consq. loss of only 3 with a max drawdown of 189. There is potential for a non trending strategy here that takes advantage of market volatility. If that performance continued, Trading at 2% risk per trade returns 12% per month and puts you in the elite bracket!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Has anyone given any consideration to basing SL size off of a X ATR value?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I personnaly put the SL on shorter TF peak/valley...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
You can also use the prior peak plus some multiple or fraction of the ATR for a stop as a way of dealing with the spikes above the peak.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I have been pretty busy this week, and have only made 2 trades since I am trading off the daily trend. Basically, my plan right now is to use peaks and valleys on the daily timeframe and to pyramid the crud out of good trends. Shouldn't take too much time, and it's where you will earn the most pips. So far, I lost one EUR/JPY long trade, and am currently short GBP/CHF.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
anyone taking th gj ?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
dagoods, What's your timeframe mate? If you can see past all your fibs, you might notice the last 4 days being relatively flat on this pair. It's all relative to the timeframe you're trading. Personally, my take on this pair is that it's poised to break out, the current trend is flat, and we are back where we started at the beginning of this week. I'd bet good limits to place would be on this week's high and low, because it never stays flat forever .

thanks k same here been stratddle this beast all week and missing the scalping pips waiting for a big move...... been tough coulda traded 5 other pairs and made dough but i have to go and be stubborn lol appreciate the advice my timeframe is 1 day to 1 week with scalping in between if i feel good about it

--- 帖子 #124 ---
may i ask what u base your anlyysis on?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I also have been straddling it and this again goes back to what your timeframe is and whether you are willing to wait for the serious pips. You can prolly trade more than one pair if you are trading longer timeframes. Normally, I will pick and choose the pairs that are trending better than others. I try not to forget that staying out is always an option. It turns out shorting GBP/CHF earlier was a good plan. I will now begin to attempt a pyramid based on 3-hour peaks and valleys permitted the trend continues..

--- 帖子 #126 ---
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

sure, let me answer with a chart...... ( upcoming cable rally should also help. .. )

Hey guys, Hope everyone had a good weekend! Forex just got done pippin' my ride as I woke up this morning, and I'm currently up a little over 1k pips.. Anyone else banking, too?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
...what a haul!...well done, Sir! Are all these trades off the Oanda 3hr and do you still use 50 pip initial stops across all pairs/crosses?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Kind of and not really I've changed a few things around. I start school this week, so I will be super busy along with work and I am more inclined to trade off of the daily chart. So here's my current plan: Peaks and Valleys on 1 Day chart Once entry is triggered, enter in the direction you are in based on 3-hour peaks and valleys (Results in pyramid scheme) S/L = Last Daily peak/valley OR last 3-hour peak/valley The 50 pip stop is definitely too small at this time frame, and right now I'll be going for bigger stops, better accuracy. We'll see how it turns out

--- 帖子 #131 ---
looks a good plan.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Beautiful... No major position here except for some Ctrend on g/u. Daily entries work best and keep you out of the noise imo, but require larger stop, so proper MM is a must... They'll also good to practice discipline and patience.... e.g. last fiber long would be around 1.4760 (and before at 1.4720 and 1.4410 (daily TF)) and is still running... netting you around 760-780ps (a little better than jacko's ah method)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi kharvell ! Someone once a time said to me : "Come to the point or piss of man" You came to the point man Attached my trade on USD/JPY 15min chart from today... Pure price action, fibonacci 50% retracement, trendline breaks and paying attention to round numbers and order flow. (Order flow =&gt; Knowing the main direction of the currency !) These are the parts of my Pip puzzle ! Refer to jackos thread and james 16 group. I learned the hart way and can assure you : 1. NO INDICATORS !!!!!!! 2. NO INDICATORS !!!!!!! 3. MONEY MANAGEMENT !! 4. MONEY MANAGEMENT !! 5. CONFIDENCE !! 6. CONFIDENCE !! Nothing else needed to reach heaven !! Full stop !! Greetings and happy trading Bernhard

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hey raczekfx, Are those EUR/USD trades real? If so, nice work man! If not, thanks for the example ! Keep up the good work, Kevin Hey Bernhard, Thanks so much for your very nice post here sharing your insights to forex. I have to agree, the simpler the better. In regards to trendlines, fibs, and even numbers, even these are overkill in my book. All I need is higher high's and low's or lower high's and low's. The rest IMO are just visual coincidences. Thanks for stopping by, Kevin

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Today was a good day for my current holdings. If there's a pair that's clearly giving you pips, why not put more in it? At any rate, here's my GBP/CHF graph (Currently holding 4 positions), and I'm up 1300 pips or about 40% account balance (FOR NOW ) Things may always go rogue on you when you leave room for it to happen. What I'm referring to are my wide stops... It is quite possible for me to walk out with quite less than 1300 pips, but the prospect of 2000's or 3000's compels me. I may have mentioned homeruns before here at FF, and that's what I go for, homeruns. If I only get a fraction, then I have still won, but if I get the homerun I seek, then I win big.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Kevin, no, there were just demo trades, but I can feel the power ( ) behind your method. I like it to the point that I'm going to give it a shot with real money in my test account. I've setup a system on both C2 and zulutrade ( for verification purpose ) and will auto trade it off daily charts ( minimum maintenance required ... ) I tweaked it a bit to take advantage of PA and if everything goes right I may post results here in a month or two... many pips, r.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
mmmmmm, I am liking this more &amp; more. Kind of strange to just look at a line instead of bars though. I will have to get used to it. Kevin the line overlay on your candels, is it 1 ema set to close or median? Racze are you going to be able to hold positions for as long as it requies, ie past 100-150 pips....?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
he, he... time will tell my friend... currently holding cable (+150) and still sitting on my hands .. (added more at 1.9566- 4hr pb and 1.9606 - 4hr peak) p.s. next trigger might be eur/gpb short few pips below current price....

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Well done Racze, if you can do it then, then i have to do it, no excuses anymore, lol.. lets go get that 1k pips &amp; more..

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hey Jeff, My SMA(1) is set to close. You can definitely hold positions more than 100-150 pips because it will be worth it . Also, if you truly plan to trade off of 3-hour charts or higher, it is a must to aim for big pips IMO. Best of luck, Kevin

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Sharing orders sounds like a good idea. A little more liveliness around here is always good . Let's try and include charts then shall we? Closest order set for me is Short GBP/JPY ~ 90 pips away.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi All, I have been trading with peaks and Valleys for quite some time now and find it to be the most effective method of trading out there, if you will let it be. I personally keep a spreadsheet of several pairs. It has the weekly direction, the daily direction and the peaks and or valleys that will reverse each direction. I personally only trade in the direction of the main trend ( which I think is the whole point of this type of system) and this spreadsheet is just a visual aid. when both weekly and daily are heading in the same direction, I frop down to the 4hr and get entries and add on spots from there. I am including the spreadsheet for anyone that wants to take a look at it. Many Pips

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Yes, sharing is good and feels good too... the latest one in a/u...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
so simple, yet elegant.. thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi raczek Are you opening your position on break of the close or "high and low" of the bar the forms a peak or valley? As I see your line chart is showing close of the bars therefore i should assume that you are entering on break of the close, unless I am mistaken.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Swingtrade65, This spreadsheet is perfect. This is exactly what should go through everybody's mind, nothing more. What is the trend for my timeframe? Where is my entrance? Do I want to enter? Great way of depicting all the information you should need. Thanks for sharing this great resource, and feel free to keep updating us as you see fit ! It is a welcome idea using the weekly to confirm the trend, but could result in missing trades as the weekly trend does not change often.. It would probably result in improved accuracy though. Keep up the good work, Kevin I will show an update of my trades tonight. Right now I'm taking a little bit of a beating, but even if I lose, I win , so no worries. Babe Ruth hit the most homeruns, but he also lead the league in strikeouts.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I have been testing this system on vHands for a while now, and it seems to work well for the most part. The trouble I have is the arbitrary 50 pip stop loss. I get stopped out too much (especially GBP/JPY). What I have found that works better it putting the stop by the nearest peak or valley behind price. For example, if going long, put the stop below the most recent major valley. The other problem of course is a ranging market. I am getting better at recognizing the beginning of a ranging market however and change my strategy to sell at resistence, buy at support, but sell if there is a breakout of support and buy if there is a breakout above resistance. The problem is I end up with losses usually before I notice the market is ranging..

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Btw, I couldn't answer the poll because it depends. I may trade naked in the summer but right now its too cold!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I do it on a break of a peak or valley, but you might want to redirect this question to more experienced folks here..

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hey Jared, Are you trading off of the 1-hour chart or higher? The 50 pip S/L was what I felt would be good for most pairs. GBP/JPY is usually an exclusion because this pair is a beast. If you want to trade GBP/JPY you must realize that it can go 150 pips in 30 minutes sometimes.. and usually 50 pips stops are hit unless you're trading a really small timeframe. Your strategy of putting your S/L by a peak/valley will undoubtedly bring you better results on this pair. To determine ranging markets, it is useful to determine the longer term trend then your timeframe. It will at least filter out many of the bad trades. You will lose, Jared. Count on it. Just accept this now, and keep trying. Best of luck, Kevin

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I am using the 4 hour time frame. I have been practicing mostly with GBP/JPY beacause I have been trying to figure out a way to trade that pair (tried several techniques) and have found that peaks and valleys works quite well on it, better then anything else I have tried, as long as you don't use a 50 pip stop loss. One of the best parts of peaks and valleys I think is the pyramiding aspect - adding to a winning position. It increases wins exponentially and keeps losses small.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Attached to this post is a document written by Swingtrade65 that he sent to me a while back. A lot of it agreed with my own trading plan, but also it shared some invaluable insights I hadn't thought of. This will be a great resource on money management for newbies especially. Pay special attention to his points on correlation, over-trading, and risk management. He has been trading for a quite a while longer than me, and I think we should give him some thanks for sharing his insights ! Hope it helps, Kevin

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Thanks, it looks good, however it says there are three sections and the document only has one, I think something is missing.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Jared, You are correct, it says that there are 3 sections. I have decided however to not publish the 2 other sections. I think it is extremely important for each trader to design their own trading system within the framework of "Peaks and Valley". Each trader has his or her own comfort level and therefore should make the system fit their individual style. If I published how I trade this system, it would most likely confuse many and create more questions than answers due to the fact that I have traded this way for more that a dozen years. My version of the system is mine and I am comfortable with it. I would encourage you to make yours a "custom Jared model"......as for the Money Management...that is very universal and one of the cornerstones of any system. It is not open for debate if you want to be doing this with your current account this time next year, it simply is how it must be. the only portion that is open within each traders system is whether or not to risk 2.5% or 2% or whatever is within reason for your situation. Best of luck in your trading pursuits, Swingtrade65

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Your wisdom &amp; expertise is truly appreciated. Just add my 2 cents as well. I think that is one of the biggest realizations that I had. Was when I truthfully started creating my own plans, ideas, &amp; opinions on the charts &amp; market. Advice from experienced traders is good &amp; allways welcome, but I didnt start to realy improve till I started just doing it myself. This is not directed at anyone but serves as a reminder to myself. Thanks again ST65

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Remember that exponetial gain thing I mentioned earlier? Here is a chart that shows what I mean. This is vHands, the trading simulator on MT4 (for those wondering what I am talking about go here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=60849 ) I added to the position as it kept making new highs and also moved the stops up to recent valleys along the way. I made a 54% increase in just this one market move alone in less than 3 weeks with very little risk. (no, I didn't know what the market was going to do, this is data from Jan last year) Actually, after the first entry was positive it was zero risk at that point, I just kept moving the stops up and adding more entires. To help you understand the 4 hour chart: The blue arrows are where I entered, the yellow arrows (they are within the yellow bar, kinda hard to see) are where I exited, and the blue dotted lines connect the two. Also the green text shows my profits on my positions. Went from 55k to 85k on this one market move! Peaks and Valleys rocks!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi Swingtrade65 ! In section 1 of your word document you mentioned to trade 6 currency pairs from which max. 2 should correlate to each other. Could you give me a little hint which pairs to choose ? Thanks in advance and happy pippin Bernhard

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Well, today started out shaky, but ended up pretty good. Here are my trades below. If my math is good, I'm up around 2100 pips which is doing nice things to my account balance. Let's just say the pound, franc, and yen have been good to me this week. Here's a chart of my GBP/JPY chart which BTW that order earlier was triggered to hit.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi all I dont know why people is not interessed in this concept but i want to ask you something. I atach a image with some entry and some stop loss and i want to ask what we do in this situation because alsmost of the time stop loss is hit. Regards

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Kevin might have a better answer but here's mine: It looks like the market is ranging. This strategy doesn't work very well in a ranging market, but it works extremely well in a trending market. What I have found is that after a strong move like is the case in the chart, the market consolidates, or goes into ranging for a period of time untill it decides on a direction. You have to either stay out of the market during ranging, or change your strategy to a ranging strategy (buy low sell high, etc). With practice you will get a feel for how the currency moves and be able to identify ranging periods easier.

JustCatalin, Move up to a 4hr chart and see if you notice the difference. MUCH clearer picture with the larger timeframe. Many Pips, Swingtrade65

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Thanks both of you for answer I know on big picture we have clear trend but this trend can be also on 4H timeframe no only in 1Hour Maybe i will take a look and i will post picture evry day like a trading journal Regards

--- 帖子 #163 ---
JustCatalin, yes, definitely move to 4hr or better yet daily and work your way down as you build up your confidence ... Here are couple trades I took recently: g/chf long off 4hr, but daily also looks good (If you also use PA, you should see BUOVB on daily today) eur/gbp short off daily (closed, don't ask ) still in g/u but came very closed to being stopped out I'm also long u/j, e/j, g/j and c/j ( those were based on PA not P &amp; V );

Thanks for posting Somtime i think i need a mentor ( i try to learn from 3 years ago and still have problem in trading....im still demo ... I love price action and i know this is the key....but i dont know what im missing because im not profitable. Anyone want to be my mentor only for price action? No ema, no indicators and no fibonacci By the way raczekfx you do great job....you make great pips...is live or demo? Regards Catalin

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I still make costly mistakes after all those years... I'd say move to dailies, reduce your trading size to minimum, have a plan and trade your plan, and you should see the difference in few months. Yes, it's a small, live P &amp; V test account from post # 136

--- 帖子 #166 ---
DId I read that correctly, a long off 4 hour but a Bearish outside vertical bar on daily??

--- 帖子 #167 ---
sorry, my bad... should be BUOVB

--- 帖子 #168 ---
That's what I was hoping, otherwise I had to go back to post 1 of J16 - and I didn't have another 14 weeks to read thru that monster... Are you taking entries from just the one time frame or using a higher one to get a trend coincidence first?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I trade off dailies and 4hr... Once I make up my mind (re: trade direction) I may drop down (rarely) to 1hr to look for a setup. Chf/gbp today was kind of an impulse trading.. I opened my platform just before 8AM est and when I saw what was happening on that cross I immediately bought yen crosses..

--- 帖子 #170 ---
How is daily direction bias determined - if it was last trending up daily for a while and then there is a day of down trend showing, would that allow a down entry on a 4 hour or is that considered counter trend and risky? In other words before taking a trade in the reverse direction on 4 hour, does a reverse direction trade have to be signaled on the daily (new peak/valley in opposite direction daily, plus the eventual breach of that, going in the opposite direction daily now)?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hey xder, My opinion for what it's worth is that you should use peaks and valleys on the daily and pyramid your positions with the whatever your position is on the daily(long or short) based on the 4-hour( or 3-hour) charts. When a peak is broken on the daily chart, is of more importance at this timeframe and usually signals a good trend. If you manage to catch a good one, you can get tons of pips from it this way. Best of luck, Kevin

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Well then, some big moves happened today and I lost a lot of positions I was carrying, especially in GBP/CHF and USD/CHF. Overall, I netted roughly 10% not counting current holdings. This is just an example of how if you go for the homeruns, you can and sometimes will strikeout. The important thing is MM and trying again. My S/L for GBP/JPY was BARELY not hit , and I guess for now it doesn't seem bad. Overall, I think the long term trend for this pair is short, but who knows how big this retracement will be.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
My next question would be what is considered a break of a high or low daily, is it just whenever it penetrates the level that is being broken or should a close beyond that level occur for validation? I'm concerned about those times where on the daily, it whipsaws around for days or weeks and could trigger a lot of failures. I'll go back and re-test by looking at breaks on daily and entries on H4. I already did some testing by just entering on H4 in the direction of whatever the previous daily move was without looking for daily break out.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I just took a fast look at a few weeks of Eur/Jpy covering trending as well as ranging times and made some fast notes to look more at. It goes something like... When a peak or valley is penetrated on the daily (taking the candle high or low as the breach point when observing the SMA1-close hump), then start looking at the 4 hour chart but not entering anything yet, even if the activity is passing beyond some 4-hour peak/valley - wait until a new one forms on the 4 hour chart and is then broken in the daily break out direction. Then exit on 4 hour peak/valley stops. That seemed to keep me out of whipsaws when things get choppy and when things were about to start trending in a big way, I was able to get in relatively early and catch a bunch of the move still once a new hump formed on the 4 hour and I took the break of that. I need to do more testing but those are the "rules" I made up as I tried it out. Wanted to document it so I don't forget and so people can evaluate and reject or add to the thoughts. Jared: Here we go again...I won't stop until I can trade from it. No more sleep until I come up with a 20+ page thesis PDF.

Hi Thexder. It was freaky to read your post as I was working on the same thing on the same pair.I've come to the same conclusion (for now). Peaks breaking peaks to cut out the whipsaws.Specializing in a few pairs there's no reason to not time in on a 5 minute chart. I look forward to your analysis.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I've been known to dive down to the 1 minute chart on GBP/USD after studying it for almost 4 months now. When I find the best pair for me to use daily and 4 hour, I'm sure I'll get out that long drillbit again and dig right down there in some fashion.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
My favorite pair is G/J, but with this method the stop would have to be too wide on the 4 hour. your questions are ones I have. My take on it is to use a combination of the 1 sma and bar chart highs and lows, with me leaning more towards the close at this stage.If that is the case, setting limit orders without watching the computer could end in some false trades. A bit of science mixed with art?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi All, I just want to throw my 2 cents in here if I may. I would like to address all of the intense scouring for a way to cut out whipsaws, get the perfect entries, perfect exits etc. etc etc The part that a lot of guys seem to be missing is that what you are looking for doesn't exist....it is an effort in futility..... In any trend folowing system there will be whipsaws...SO WHAT.... Do not get caught up in the quest to be right....Would you rather be right and a breakeven or worse trader, or are you interested in taking many many pips from the market.......THE most important part is to study money and position management....while many people are busy trying to find the optimal method.....there are many out there who are pulling hundreds and in some cases thousands of pips every week.....this method works as is....period Trading is not about the system.....trading is about managing yourself and your own destructive behaviors.....trading is about money management.....trading is about taking money from those who cannot do the first two Many Pips to All

--- 帖子 #179 ---
The problem I have with whipsaws is when I try to follow the break outs and stops as they come and take whatever happens, I might see a successful big move of several hundred but then I lose 50 to 150 per whipsaw back and forth and it wipes out the big moves. That's what I want to figure out how to optimize into net profit.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thexder, first off, I have been through where you are at mentally...trying to rationalize this or that system......I went through that about 15 years ago.....What I am telling you is that if you trade this system on a 4hr or higher timeframe using sound money management, you will make pips, and lots of them.....I personally have pulled over 4,000 pips from these Yen crosses in the last 2 weeks....I guarantee that will more than make up for any little 50 or 150 pip whipsaw that I endure until the next trend shows itself...... Once again I think you are still missing the point.....it is not the system.....you can even flip a coin as long as you manage your money effectively. I only have positive weeks about 45% of the time.....which means that about 5-6 of every 10 weeks I am down on the week......but the number that is most telling is that my winning weeks are about 3.5-4 times larger than my losing weeks....I still pull many pips from the market when you look at it on a monthly basis......it has NOTHING to do with the system.....is has everyting to with the fact that when I am wrong, I only lose a small portion of my capital...but when I am right, I squeeze them until they scream for mercy....I will ride a trend for as long as it will go....weeks or even months adding every time we take out a new peak or valley..... Don't waste your time trying to fix the method, spend your time fixing the things that you have control over. Best of Luck

swingtrade65 - I read your last two posts! Good Job, those are great!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Does that mean that just blindly taking each peak, whether it means stop and reverse, or add more to ongoing trade, with equal lot sizes in all cases, that is the kind of result to expect? And is that just sticking to one time frame and not using a higher one to confirm/filter out anything? Because that's what I thought was causing a loss for all the gains on Eur/Jpy when I looked at it taking each peak and that's why I tried to fix it. Or is it to do with how I was looking at a valid entry, using the high or low of a "peak candle" instead of the level of that peak (candle close value)? If I can figure out how to use the method in its rawest form, I'd gladly do so.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I'll put more time into looking at the simple system again. I took a wider view of E/J daily only with the SMA1_close and maybe it makes more sense suddenly, like in August I think there was a 1000 pip drop to be had, and when it does reverse back and forth and every peak is taken at the close price value, by taking 2 short lived peaks and then having to reverse, the compounding in the one direction may balance some of the drawdowns. I guess I'm just used to finding systems that fail and I automatically try to fix them.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hmm.. lots of good posts guys! Thexder, Swingtrade65 is seriously driving the main point home here. If you do not know it already, he is pouring his wisdom all over you my friend. I will try to expand on his points and maybe I can help you a little bit. The only relevant example I have to forex is Babe Ruth . Do you know how Babe Ruth hit so many homeruns? He swung the crap out of his bat on every pitch. What was the result? Most homeruns, most strikeouts. What does this mean in forex? Probably nothing, but the idea could be very important of cutting losses short and letting profits run. I do not know if you have gotten a chance to read any of the Market Wizards series that go in depth into successful traders' minds, but in these books, you will notice that almost every successful trader in it alludes to cutting losses and letting profits run. Do you think this is coincidence? Now, I mentioned before, predictions are for fortune tellers and mystics. If you can predict forex, there will be no reason why you cannot retire in 2 weeks. You just call every shot and bet your whole account every time, right? In my case, I've yet to stumble upon a mystic or fortune teller to help me out, so I've had to find my own way ! What you are doing when you are backtesting is optimizing past data. "Oh I would have won here had I done this." Let me tell you from experience that hindsight is a wonderful thing, but forex is an UNPREDICTABLE beast and you will never see what you've seen again, so why optimize your system for it. The other thing is it is hard to backtest the effects of pyramiding positions on long trends. I can assure you from experience that one 6k to 7k pip trend ride you will have one day with this system will more than cover your losses. The other thing that will help you out is diversification. Sticking to one pair is alright in some cases, but every pair consolidates and trends at different intervals. Although it may be possible to have a horrible week, it is more likely to have a breakeven or positive week with a diversified portfolio. Usually when you are in smaller timeframes is when you will want only one pair. The bottom line is, as I've been saying all along. You must find the trend, enter it at an advantageous postion, and ride it as long as you can. The reason why peaks and valleys works is that it "tests" each direction for you. You really don't have to think, just place the orders. However, the logic behind it is that you are breaking key resistance/support and going with the trend, which could hopefully produce many pips for you. At any rate, I hope this helps, Kevin

--- 帖子 #185 ---
kharvell - I understand we should look at all pairs. Trading the Higher time frames - 4HR and Daily, will allow us to look at more pairs. In your strategy, what pairs do you most like to trade and do you feel certian pairs trend better the others, if so which ones? Thanks

--- 帖子 #186 ---
DivePIPS, Pairs are always moving, trending, and consolidating. It took me definitely well into my second year of trading to realize that each year is different, and pairs can and will change with each new year as far as "characteristics" you may notice. This goes back to forex being an unpredictable beast . It's to what extent of the trends and the correlations of your holdings that could potentially get you. For instance, a good trend for EUR/USD on the 3-hour chart might net you 400 pips, and this is well and good. However, if you were to move to GBP/JPY (a beast), a good trend on the 3-hour chart would net you 1000 pips. It's a big difference, but they're both good trends when you take the pairs and only look at them by themselves. This will mostly affect your stops only. Let pairs that move more breathe more and be sure to adjust your risk accordingly. With this being said, I know we are all looking for the silver platter, so here's yours, although it's quite early for dinner Pairs I trade (and I just made one recent change of AUD/JPY to AUD/NZD): AUD/NZD CAD/JPY EUR/USD GBP/CHF GBP/JPY USD/CHF Reasons? Not too much correlation. Only 2 max holding per currency or rather: 2 JPY's 2 CHF's 2 USD's 2 GBP's 1 CAD 1 NZD 1 AUD 1 EUR Correlation exists, but it's not going too overboard. That's my plan for now, I agree with Swingtrade65 about 6 pair max, and trade at your own risk Best of luck, Kevin

So I took a look at the daily chart for Eur Jpy for the past 2 years, January 06 to present, only looking at the daily. I used the close prices to locate peaks and valleys but considered a break of the peak/valley as being the extreme high or low of the bars forming the peaks and valleys instead of just the close price levels. After the last 2 years the net result was around 400 pips, with the maximum ever being almost 2000 and the minimum being around -1200, most of the time it was a negative pip balance in the several hundreds. What did I do wrong or what should I be doing instead of the way I did it?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I'm using the breakout method, filled a long on USD/CHF @ 1.0951. You can see this minute fractal peak on H4, but better to see a clear picture on H1. The order filled yesterday, and I was able to move my s/l to break even b/c of the spike down on 01.17. 13:35. I will be looking to add around 1.1088 to hedge my risk and let the trade ride.... Now, my question relates to fractals using Candlesticks &amp; Line Charts. The market can only do three operators which seem to be imo: " &gt;, &lt;, = " Also several quant books, will talk about this logic, and common sense which I know is uncommon (ahha) Based on stats from Forex Wave Cycles, about 70% two wave cycles, will break the high peak, or low valley; about 28%, go less then, the previous high (peak), or low (valley). Finally, about 2% of the time cycles will become " = " or in Fibonacci terminology, truncate at 100% retracement, at the peak or valley. Now, obviously or not so obviously in hindsight sometime those 2% trades can be 1000000000's of pips, the paradox of nature I guess? My question, relates to the first post on this board, by the mod, using avg. bars data, based on reversal amount like KAGI charts I guess? or being humble and using line charts(maybe foolish?), or using candlesticks. Based on experience not hindsight, does anyone have an opinion on this matter in relation to successfully placed trades? My opinion is rather subjective, because on &gt; 4hr charts the difference between a line chart close, and a candlestick high or low, can be hundreds of pips. Now, you might get stopped out more b/c the line chart, however in relation to money management the rule of 2%, and the 2% of " = " truncating cycles(that trick line chart entry orders).....in relation too.... Your frequency will be much higher and the trades that go into trends will go in your favor with more pips locked up. So is there no answer to this rant. English not my native tongue sorry for the poor language in advance. Thanks, NAGE

Are you pyramiding when a trend occurs? Thats the only way I have been able to make this system profitable, despite occaisional whipsaws. Like I mentioned in an earlier post, by pyramiding on vHands I was able to produce a 54% gain in 3 weeks on GBP/JPY.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
LOL

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Well said. This has been difficult for me. It is a lot harder then it sounds! 2 problems: 1) I have a tendancy to get stopped out only to find that the trend isn't over (usually from a large market spike possibly due to a news release). 2) In order to manage my positions, I have a tendancy to "babysit" them. I have a hard time setting and forgetting. Especially when I get to the point where there is a lot of money at stake beacause of pyramiding and I think the trend might be due for a retrace soon. I don't want to miss out on gains so I watch PA closely to determine which peak or valley to place stops to protect profits. I don't really know what to do about these problems other then more practice on vHands.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yeah, if there were successive peaks in the same direction I was up to a max of 6 positions at a time, then when a counter peak occurred I exited all 6 and took one the other way, etc. Maybe EurJpy just isn't any good for this.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I think one way to learn to set and forget is to have more than one thing going on at once (assuming there is expected success with the method in play). Such as setting and forgetting a method that requires daily checking only, while proceeding to scalp some other pair on an hourly chart to keep busy.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I would have done what Thexter does with regard to using the 1 sma as the "master" for peaks and valleys, and setting the highs &amp; lows for entry orders. I've changed my mind about going with the daily and timing in on the 4 hourly.The e/g is a good example of it not working. its been in a daily up trend, but is now in a 4 hourly downtrend. Am I correct in saying that the people who use this successfully, pick a timeframe and take every signal regardless of the daily trend, and trendline, sup, res breaks.And just pyramid into positions and this will take care of the drawdown?Also by picking an arbitrary method; either highs or lows, OR 1 sma closes and just sticking to the one come what may?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
On E/J I even tried using the weekly as a trend guide and taking the daily signals in the weekly direction, but I found that I was always trying to take trades daily against the daily trend so I didn't have many openings to get in, or if I did, I got stopped out. So then when that week would end and the new weekly trend is reversed, I'd reverse my intentions daily but then daily would reverse on me and I'd again be kept out of the good daily entries and get in the bad ones because I'm trying to follow weekly bias. I guess we need a review of the exact rules, what is considered a peak or valley trigger level, entry level, stop level, and if that should work on a stand alone single time frame on any pair. I know the method was supposed to be simple, just take all the peaks as entries or stops and reversals..but it's not looking so simple right now. Sometimes I'd pyramid in and net +1000, but then I'd get -350, -120, etc until I'm net -1200 or something, just taking all the entries, and it isn't a "just take the whipsaws and drawdown" issue, it balanced out to mostly failure.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Am i missing something. I downloaded the .doc file and it is only a partial. Is it the document or is it me? Probably me .

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I don't think taking all the signals is good. If I ride a trend up to where it starts to retrace and exit, I don't enter right away on the next peak or valley. Many times after a strong trend there is a period of consolidation. I try and make sure the market is not consolidating before I get back in, or at least in a large enough range to be able to range trade successfully. I then enter on a breakout of the range to catch the next trend.

I was just studying this consolidation issue on E/J for September and October 2006 before I came to the thread again. I am working out a method to detect the hazards. One thing I noticed in that ranging period is once it was clear the up trend was over, there was an extreme high and low around the start of Sept and the next 2 months couldn't get out of either end so waiting for the break would be one approach. The other thing I have been working on after staring at daily charts all day, we all know that in a trend, there are mostly new highs and lows in the direction of the trend, with the occasional travel beyond the stair step ideal situation (triggering a stop I guess) but then the trend may resume, so the way that may make sense to detect a possible consolidation vs a temporary stall in the trend that will resume - This needs more work because I only watched a few months but.... Say the trend was up, then suddenly you see lower highs/lows. If there are two of each formed successively, lower high and lower low, then put things on hold and wait. Don't consider it a reversal yet - consider it a range/consolidation pending investigation. I haven't worked it out completely but one way to resume the up trend, or to fully accept a reversal and start taking a down trend, wait for another set of two successive higher highs and lows, or lower highs and lows. Then take the next high or low break out in the trend direction. So in the case of the up trend that suddenly ended up seeing two lower highs and lower lows in a row, if the next move went lower than that second low, I'd consider the trend now short and take a short trade on that break. Or if things just got messy in true consolidation fashion and there were highs and lows all over the place sideways, then nothing is traded until 2 consecutive in the same direction form and are broken. So this might keep you out of ranging periods and during a trend you will occasionally get stopped out on those few out of bound peaks or valleys but you get back in when they are broken again as usual so you just miss out on a few pips without getting tossed back and forth (don't stop and reverse, just stop and wait to see if it re-breaks or forms consolidation). I told you there would be a 20 page essay coming soon. Remember my fib days in late November, I didn't sleep until I was satisfied. I'm not feeling very tired tonight.... Edit: I just progressed onward in the chart and around July and August 07 there were those 2 big sudden down moves, very large moves with no warning and I wonder how I could have captured that if I didn't ease into a trend reversal, and didn't stop and reverse during the up trend. So I'm wondering about having a shortcut trend reversal if something drastic happens like a single counter trend move takes out two peaks or valleys in a row - use the first violation as a stop in the trend as usual and if the next one in line is taken out, take the counter trade. That was just a rough thought, I know it would trigger a lot of reversals falsely but maybe the stop outs would be so small on the false trades, it wouldn't matter. Or better yet, instead of a fixed number of highs/lows, find a recent significant looking support or resistance area, a sudden spike outside all the recent action, and if that is taken out against the trend, reverse. Or a reasonable trend line following the obvious trend in play, if that's taken out...Doesn't really matter how it's done. One good way might be to look at the chart and visually find the price at which the trend would be arc'd in the other direction and take that level as an emergency trend reversal to catch an unexpected move. That seems to look good in the mid-late 2007 E/J examples. I don't mean to go curve fitting a fixed data set, just making notes in what I see, then when I'm done I'll review the observations and see if something can be summarized, then go test it on a long sample set of the pair, if it looks good, consider using it, and testing it on other pairs. If it only seems to work custom to that one pair it was developed on, nothing wrong with that. I don't mind coming up with a specific set of rules for each pair if I need to, as long as I make money. It's art. And technical. Perfect balance of a career.

Thexder, I appreciate your enthusiasm, and I am liking that you are thinking, as this is what I want people to do here: use their brains. I'm a little confused because I look at charts in the past and all I see are pips, yet you look at it and you see a lot of losses. Maybe this post will help you. To be honest, I think you need to be forward testing this method on a demo instead of backtesting. I used to be quite an avid back tester, and realized it's really only realtime results that matter... You are not learning the ins and outs of the method when you are backtesting. Here's a consolidating market in GBP/JPY that happened around 2 months ago and went for a while. We lose a couple of trades as it begins to get choppy. At the Light blue vertical line, the candle has just closed, and a new valley has formed, but it's not lower than the last one. This is a clue that it's probably choppy waters. I would probably set orders on the extremes of the consolidation range and go from there. If I had place orders at that point, I would have potentially lost a short trade immediately after the Light Blue vertical line. On the red vertical line, it begins to indicate consolidation as a new valley forms above the last. Again, I would set orders for the consolidation extremes, and that helps me out for the rest of the consolidation. Best of luck, Kevin

Here's the 2 month consolidation of Eur Jpy where I can't see how to come out on top mostly but it's this type of following the peaks that causes the net failure in my 2 years of observations. The first red line at the top left marks a sell and reverse that happens to be at the end of an up trend. Then there's another red sell line on the way down, so far so good, then things shoot up and a stop and reverse occurs on the first green line, causing some profit taking from the first red line and a loss on the second one. There is a narrow up and down area and a red line causes a stop of the green. Then a green causes a stop of that red. Two red shorts follow, which are both taken out for a loss by the 3rd green. After a few more broader peaks, a red takes out that green with some profit at least, if taken on the actual SMA points, but the short taken by that red...gets stopped on a ride up with another green, so we go long again and get taken out for maybe break even on the next red, and that red is taken out for a loss on the following green, but we get 2 greens in a row that get us almost out of consolidation, the last two reds with the 3 greens cause more losses..etc. When I actually did the exercise I was trading on the extreme values at the candle areas where the peaks and valleys formed. Maybe that caused my problems. Maybe I'll try another pip count with just taking the close value and making note of possible clues of consolidations. I chose to use the candle high/low instead of close price because I saw that was the latest method being considered...

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I am trying to figure the best kind of money/position management for this strategy. Now, it seems to me that one can pyramid indefinately, why limit it to six? For example, say I buy, a new valley forms, then a peak, I buy again and move my stop up to the valley just formed. If I coninue to move my stop up it is locking in my profits. I know the rule is to not risk an excessive amount of your account ballance, but say you risk 2%, and then that 2% risked is locked in at break even or better by moving the stop up to the next valley, then it is no longer at risk, and another 2% can be risked, while the first position is still in play. For each position you lock in at breakeven or better, a new position can be opened. You could have 20 positions opened and only be risking 2% of your account balance this way. Follow me? When the trend finally reverses, your positions will be stopped out, and worse that can happen is the most recent postition might be negative, but all of the others are positive. That's the beauty of pyramiding.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
That's how I was doing it in my testing. Any time a new peak is triggering a buy, if I already have 2 lots in play, I add a 3rd, and whenever the first valley stop occurs I exit all the lots and enter one the other way, starting over. The problem was all this reversing and going the other way ended up with a net E/J loss.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
One thing I have been experimenting with is taking a step back, maybe not on another time frame, but just click the - button so you can see a larger history of the market, and then try and determine what the MAJOR peaks and valleys are. Not every peak/valley is an entry/exit signal. While pyramiding I may have my most recent position stop behind the most recent peak/valley, but my other stops are behind a more major peak/valley as long as profits are still locked in. I won't reverse a position untill a major peak/valley is broken and I am stopped out. Now, if the market flattens out, I move stops to the edge of the consolidation, to lock in profits, and then enter in the direction of a clear breakout. If you get a couple of stop outs that may indicate choppyness. Take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and wait for a more clear entry signal to get back into the market. Sometimes it's best to not be in the market then to fight chop.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Along that train of thought of taking a step back, sometimes the market is in a very large range (noticed it with GBP/JPY especially). The peak/valley method can still work, but just treat the up and down movements in the range as small trends, and trade accordingly, being extra cautious around the support and resistance areas of the range.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
This is why i use fractals and not close to draw the peak/valley patterns. You can also use high price for peaks and low prices for valley as someone advised in a previous post. You will have a tiny channel doing so but you should have less whipsaw.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Kevin, great thread and some very sound advice for everyone. What timeframes are you using.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
So take the high of the candle tops and low of the candle bottoms as the peaks and valleys? I think that may be what I had done actually when I went the first time through, I saw the peaks on the close and then used the candle extremes to trade from....I am guessing if I looked at only candle extremes to form the peaks and valleys instead of first looking at close value peaks and valleys (then trading the extremes) it's the same result...the first time I looked at this method I had a sma1 high and sma1 low channel along with the sma1 close and decided if I trade the extremes either way, I don't need the outside channel, just look at the close waves and trade the spikes. How does the fractal thing work?

--- 帖子 #211 ---

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Here's an idea instead of fractals. Pin bar chart, 2 ma's period 1, one on highs, one on lows, give it a little room to breath.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I think we all keep saying the same thing in different ways! That's essentially what I was trading by taking highs and lows while viewing the sma close, but taking every peak/valley. So if we give it room to breathe by looking back at it zoomed out like this I wonder if something could be made of it. For example I can see several smaller peaks and valleys that could be considered insignificant within more major peaks and valleys now. Maybe this analysis would have a similar effect to what I was looking at with using a two successive peak/valley trend filter.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi Kevin, Very interesting concept you have presented here. Thank you for your contributions to this community. I would just like to clarify a couple of points on how to trade it. You first began employing this strategy on the 1hour charts but have seemed to move up to the 4hour charts. Any particular reason for this? Less whipsaws? Also, there has been quite a debate as to whether or not to use the daily trend as confirmation or just to take every signal, be it on the 1hour or 4hour charts. Any take on this? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
You are right. This peaks and valley can be adapted in very different way but it will globally look at resistance/support whatever method we use. The important point is pyramiding the winning trade.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I guess it's a matter of trying to see peaks and valleys clearly. I've been playing around with different ways of looking at the same thing to try and make P&amp;V clear to my eye. I agree that the pyramiding is the most attractive part of this method.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hey guys, I had a chance to briefly study my charts this weekend in order to really address the concerns about maybe filtering out some of the bad trades. Ultimately, I came up with an idea of using Heiken Ashi candles instead of regular candles. My idea was to require alternating color candles in order to confirm peaks and valleys. Does this make sense? So, for instance, on the mini chart below, the first peak will be valid because it alternates from green candle to red candle, but the rest of the peaks and valleys would be invalid because the heiken ashi candles stay red the whole time. My only problem with this is that it's adding an indicator.... and I like to be naked ! The other main negative I see to this is the result of missing some good trades, but it tends to cut down losses on the same token perhaps. Please remember that this is JUST AN IDEA! I WANT feedback from everyone because often I am inclined to think I have a good idea when in actuality I do not. Best of luck, Kevin

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Isn't this method based on the idea of entering on a breakout of a period of consolidation in the direction of the prevailing trend? In short, entering on retracements/rallies when trend resumes? Don't the highs and lows of the consolidation period remain the same regardless of type of candle used? Haven't we been assured by swingtrader65 that this method works just fine, and that we need to ,"tweak," ourselves and not it? Shouldn't we just keep entering on breakout signals, secure in the fact that there will be eventually follow through on one of them which will exceed the losses and make a profit? I thought all this had been decided.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I realize this is an indicator free zone, but having traded a very similar way, I found that taking trades only in the direction of the long term guppy helps with my profitability. Or, look at LinuxTrolls system. It's basically the same thing, just using mma's and line price to better see the valleys and peaks. The nice thing with either is that you can visually see when the markets are ranging and based on this you can stay out or shoot for breaks of peaks/valleys that are further out. Either of these might be beneficial to those who need practice in seeing market direction before going purely PA for their entries. Jason

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I also spent the weekend staring at that most troublesome zone of E/J in Sept/Oct 2006 trying to make an observation about it. This may sound confusing, mostly because it's a lot of specific observing and I'm only just starting, but again just to get it written down and then sort it out later if something comes of it: 1. Whenever there are 3 consecutive days that don't have much luck continuing onward in the trend of the big picture and 2. Within those 3 days, two of them have changed daily direction consecutively (not counting whatever direction price was upon entering the zone) and 3. During the course of this stall, a stop out has occurred from a position prior to the stall (still working on that thought).... Then consolidation may be coming and I am looking at ideas like waiting for at least 2 more consecutive days of the same daily direction and an apparent clear move from the trouble zone, either up or down, then wait for the next setup. I am still working on thoughts such as, surely there's periods of 3 day support/resistance during a healthy trend but in those times I find that there doesn't seem to be the back and forth day to day direction shift and/or it occurs in a case where no stop outs occur as a result of the stall, so simply continue taking the peaks and valleys and adding to the position if no stops occur. I'm also still somewhat unclear how to take the entries while avoiding false entries at the same time - like when you go long on a peak but during normal everyday movement that could have been falsely stopped on the next day with a minor retracement that in the end doesn't cause a new valley, but you get stopped...

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Jared: This one's for you... Ok I was just working on something else to combine somewhat with looking at alternating days and congestions that emerge. This is yet another lovely picture of E/J for those troublesome months. I haven't evaluated this outside the area shown so it's yet to be confirmed in other scenarios but what I found is during the prior uptrend leading to the circle, if there was a point where a countertrend day formed, leading to a pending pyramid long the next day if things resume within 1 more day, then I notice during the counter trend day, price did make it up in the direction of the main trend during that down day, peaking higher than the previous candle. I mark those with a check mark to show a down day with a higher high, supporting a pyramid entry the next day if the peak/valley is surpassed as usual. When it gets to the top there is another valid signal with a down day that has a higher high during the day, but it is the end of the trend and a valid casualty of war, but we could have probably taken care of that specific reversal in time without much loss by recognizing the pin bar, or technically the "stop" valley is also right up there near the pyramid long point, there was a slight valley. Then the X's start marking points where there were 1 day reversals where the price action on that reversal day could not make a new high or low supporting a peak or valley trade the following day. That first X occurs as a halt during a down move, but during that one up day, the bar didn't make it any lower than the day before it, so I would suggest we don't take the short trade on the next day when the valley is broken. It turns out it would have gotten stopped out. The second X marks a 1 day counter trend to the down side where that day failed to make a higher high from the day before, so I would not take a long if the next day breaks the peak. (When I say counter trend I mean whether the most recent hump was a peak or valley, that day is going against it). The 3rd X marks a counter day (upward) leaving behind a valley, and that counter up day didn't breach the valley it's trying to beat on the next day possibly, so I wouldn't take a pending short the next day. This goes on for a while and by now we'd see there is a lot of that back and forth trending and a consolidation looks evident. Then there's a check mark where a one day down reversal occurs, leaving a peak behind and the bar made a new high, so if the following day should trigger a peak long trade, I'd take it, but that doesn't happen. After this point we start seeing at least 2 consecutive days of the same trend and the consolidation range may be breaking visually. So I'd go back to normal peak and valley trading as long as there are at least 2 days of trend to work with. If there are more 1 day reversals I'd again check to see if during that reversal, a new high or low was made compared to the previous day to support a potential trade on the next day. A little more than half way across the chart is a lone check mark, showing a one day reversal that made a higher high so I'd take the next long although it eventually gets stopped. Those other surrounding unmarked peaks and valleys would be traded as normal because they aren't 1 day reversals. Then on the right of the chart we get another small congestion but most of them are not taken due to the X method. There is one check mark that is a failed trade but that's how it goes. Then we see more than 1 day of the same trends forming so we start trading normally and take a successful long peak that ends up in an up trend again. I'm now going through the trending periods and making some small rules that may help protect against those bad times and at the same time not prevent getting in on good trades (like when there is a 1 day pullback and during that pullback, the bar doesn't break the previous day, I can still manage to take the next day trade instead of anticipating a consolidation if I make a few observations). What I'm hoping to achieve is still a method that functions the same overall - just a few minutes needed at the beginning of each new daily candle in order to make the decision for the next action, just going through a small check list about what's just occurred and making a simple if-then choice. It's still a fixed set of rules that can be blindly followed without needing to use discretion unless chosen. Instead of "Oh look, a new peak, let me set a pending order" I want to take the extra minute to come up with "Oh look, a new peak, but instead of placing an order here, I'll move it up there since we had a 1 day reversal".

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I've been going over E/J for hours and now I have a rat's nest of observations - I almost need to print cue cards and try to number them in the proper sequence because as I get new ideas some old ones can be rejected. But I think something is beginning to emerge. It could still all fall to pieces on me once I put it together and give it a test run on some random point in time. If things pan out, I think I'll have to make a PDF with the ideas and samples of how to implement them, but if I end up going in circles and haven't come up with anything useful, let's just pretend I never said anything!

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi All, Once again this method is ringing the cash register in a BIG way. I may be hard headed about discussing the merits of trading this way, but it is hard to argue with results. I was just wondering if anybody else is taking all of these great signals we had in the last couple of days......Kevin.....I know you have a lot of these Yen crosses short....Anyways, I hope many of you are ringing the register as well.... Many Pips

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Kevin, If it works, it's good. Don't worry about Heiken Ashi candles being another indicator. Conventional candles (and bars) are indicators, too. They distort data by showing 4H worth of tick data (or 1H or whatever) on a single vertical. The only naked chart is a pure tick data chart. Keep up the good work. I need to get more involved with this system. It really looks good AND logical.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Thexder, Again, You seem to be fixated on the "non-normal" times of E/J pair. There have been and always will be times in any trend following system where it gets whipsawed and that is simply part of the game....nothing you can do about that. Meanwhile, I have over 1600 pips in the yen crosses, E/U and U/C pairs.....this may be abnormal, I don't know, but what I do know is that I keep ringing the cash register. At some point you will have to come to terms with the fact that there will always be abnormal times in all pairs. There is also the fact that you cannot be a trend follower and be right 75% of the time. There is a natural tendency for people to have a couple of losses in a row or go through a bad time with a system and they immediately try to find a way to "filter" out the bad trades or look for a way to keep from being wrong. We have been taught our whole lives that being right is the most important thing, we must get all of our spelling words correct etc etc......this is a bad behavior in trading......once again, we are here to make money, and everything else in our personality and ego must take a back seat to this single pursuit.....pull pips from the market..period. If we are accomplishing this, the method is irrelevant. I am quite finished discussing the bad periods in the E/J . If you have a question for me that is relevant to making more money, then I am very much ready and willing, however, I will not continue with this current discussion that has been lingering on for days. Best of Luck and Many Pips

--- 帖子 #226 ---
AMEN

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Of course losses are expected. My fixation wasn't with how to handle some draw down, it was as I pointd out, the fact that I came up empty on two full years when attempting to implement the method, therefore I was and still am questioning what entry and exit methods do seem to work since I got them wrong somehow. I continually have yet to see a response so I keep asking while trying to answer it on my own as well and posting any thoughts along the way. Maybe that was mistaken as short term E/J fixation. That would be wasted effort to try to rectify. I'm trying to fix the 2 year picture not the 2 week picture. My question still therefore remains, what are the rules for taking a position and placing the stop initially, that allow the success of the method? For example, if there is an up trend in place with the stop valley well below current price, then a small pull back gives a new peak and valley, a new position is added when the peak is broken. Is that taken at the close price of the peak always (or are there some times where some other candle high would be traded instead of the close during the peak), and is a stop moved up immediately at that point of long entry, to the valley that just formed (it could be taken out just by noise until things pick up again)? I had seen some posts regarding using the high/low values instead of or in addition to just the original SMA close values and things went off track in my understanding. That's what I'm focused on for days, not why E/J has a few negative days here &amp; there. I don't know how that got so lost in translation.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Thexder, I see your question. It seems so far that there is no "system" answer for this at this time. I've been reading along for some time now (lurking). Somewhere along there I decided to use a 1SMA of the MEDIAN price to pick my peaks and valleys. Untill posts from 2 days ago, I thought that was how everyone was doing it. Now I'm not so sure. Then, I'm mixing that with the bar high/low for figuring my entry. Again, I thought everyone was doing this. Will it matter? Somehow, I think it is probably noise. If you were to analyze it I bet you'll find it works in my favor sometimes, and not others. Now I am focusing on 4 hour charts, and mostly I want to be in the direction of the Weekly and Daily trends. But if I get a disagreeing signal (a peak say, thought the daily says stay short), I don't expect that is going to run away and change the course of history... Undersand, I say that's my expectation... Reality is only known after the fact. So, anyway, I'm going to guard those counter positions much more closely... Yes, I'm going to put a TS or a TP on them. I'm not big on breaking even either. I'll take 5 points in those counter situations, thank you very much... But if everything is aligned, I'm going to work it for whatever I can. Back to your point... Hard and fast rule... I think there are only a couple of people around here with solid P&amp;V rules they are convinced of, and they are not obligated to let us know what they are doing, beyond what they choose to tell us. But, I have to agree that if we are learning anything here, part of it is that you will lose, and maybe often. So don't be happy with just one pair, you'll need more. And MM is what helps you survive those bad days, weeks, months... Perfection... I haven't found that yet... and now I've pretty much stopped looking. Much less stress working it that way.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Well I don't expect any proprietary secrets that aren't up for divulging, as I said I've also been working long hours on this "problem" myself, I'm not looking for free info. But I thought the thread was supposed to be there to help others who don't have the skills for the method...to acquire them. Things just got...totally weird. When I read that reply about me being stuck on trying to never lose a trade basically...I was stunned if not amused at how that happened. So now we wait and see if someone can help clarify the questions that seem to be shared by more than just me afterall. If not, I'll figure something out like I always do. BTW I think I'm close to finding a compromise with keeping things simple but preventing some false early stops just after getting in a trade. If I need to post any more charts to ask for advice about what to do in a certain situation, I think I'll post a chart of GBP/JPY or something else that doesn't cause a lot of sensitivity.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Just one last thing to say. This is not normal communication in here. There is so much that can be misinterpreted in this medium. There is much we can't see or understand about each other without seeing. It is easy to give the wrong impression. So, your question came about an obeservation of one pair, while others are looking at something more. You have a concern about a result over a 2 year period, and you seem to have boiled that down to an offensive 2 month period. Your bigger question about system rules got lost in your example. When you stayed on that one note, the more you named the issue (rules) dressed in your example (the poor pair), the more everyone is hearing only about the one pair. You heaped a huge effort into understanding that "problem", but it has been sounding like WE have to find an explanation for the behaviour of a pair. Your work on that is bringing you new insights that we all might learn from. I thank you for that. But your issues with the rules is the key point. If the world was completely run by email and chat, the earth would be a nuclear holocost several times over by now, I assure you.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I think traders such as swingtrader65 have so many years of experience that the rules for entry and stop management just come naturally by instinct, whereas people like Thexder (and myself) don't have that type of thing repetatively ingrained in our heads so therefore have to come up with a more systematic approach to using this method successfully. I really appreciate everybodies contribution here, it is all valuable info. Swingtrader65 has the wisdom of ages of trading. I like how Thexder picks a topic apart and analyzes it to death until he has defeated it by a massive force of systematic logic. Just look what he did with the Fibonacci thread, he IS the majority of the thread (when it first started)! His insights have certainly helped me, as he lays his entire learning and thought process open for the world to view on the forum. Keep it up Thex! Truth be told, there is certainly an element of discretion involved in this method just as in the beginning Kevin mentioned choosing the "major" peaks and valleys. The more systematic the method can be the more reliable and predictable it can be. For example, I went through a whole year of GBP/JPY on VHands twice and tripled my acount one time and didn't quite double it a second time. I did something different to get those different results, I used my own discretion differently. The more you can take discretion out of it the better. Heck, if you could take it completely out, maybe someone could write and EA that would do this method automatically! Now if I could only do something about those dang market spikes that stop me out I would be rich very soon.......Actually, maybe just paying attention to the news would solve that problem. Can't do that on VHands (yes I am still in the testing phase with this method).

--- 帖子 #232 ---
The main reason I stayed with those few months of data is because I needed a control in the experiment....I knew I had a misunderstanding of the rules of the method so I wanted to figure them out by observing what I figured was a reasonable data set - a 2 month period that contained ranging plus trending...and when I could figure out how to trade that with what everyone says is a great successful method, maybe I'd have solved my misunderstanding...and so then the chaos began. I haven't gone back and re-read my posts but the way I think I was presenting everything was...admitting I couldn't get the rules right, asking if anyone can help clarify, even posting a sample chart and asking if anyone had an opinion on how to trade a few peaks or valleys for demonstration if that's better, if not in the meantime I'm working on it but any help would be great etc...and I asked for the rules a few times after that, and got nothing so I kept working on it. I thought if I came up with something, whether it was over complicated or not any better performing, maybe it's still useful to someone including me for doing the research, and as Kevin said he wants us to use our brains. I thought everything was wonderful! So let's end the chaos and hope nobody thinks I'm a free loader getting cranky about not having everything handed to me. This past day has made me quite defensive about that. I'm used to the past few months since September reading threads here where people were open about their ideas, including me whenever I had new realizations, I've been helped by people, and sometimes taken their ideas and made them something different to add, and passed that on successfully to other people since then. But this was a new experience for me. And I just realized it sounds like I'm saying I was called a freeloader. I wasn't, but that's how it makes me feel when it sounds like people are telling me to accept whatever I've been given and if I can't figure it out, shut up about E/J...

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Xder, This is the last time I'm talking about the rules. One of the reasons I've been hesitant to answer your questions is because the answer to your question has been repeated throughout the forum. The answer is there is no answer. From the beginning, I have said, enter the trend and ride it for pips. What is hard about this? Also, I have a post earlier that describes more or less how I will/have been trading it, which can be found here: http://forexfactory.com/showpost.php...&amp;postcount=130 This wasn't a hard answer to find, just took a little searching efforts. In reality though, there are no rules. All that you need is to enter the trend and get pips. Don't make it more complicated than it has to be. I thought I told you earlier you should be forward testing Quit wasting time, and tune yourself with the market already. You're not learning the paces of the market with this method by staring at old charts. Best of luck, Kevin

--- 帖子 #234 ---
The hard thing about that was not about finding the trend to take or anything so complicated as that. My biggest expressed concern was over the issue of mostly where to put a stop at the time of getting in (either at the start of trend or the compounding entries) since if it's immediately placed where it ought to be, it could be zapped before the trade takes off. If there are no rules for how to manage that scenario, then I'll do it the way I came up with days ago that I think I posted. I did read the thread 2 or 3 times looking for the answer before. That's where I became confused seeing talk of candle high/low vs close and mention of "the rules" being reconsidered recently to account for it. So I was asking about it. This doesn't have to be this complicated. No need for people to start huffing because someone is confused. Just say "it's in the thread" or "I can explain why you can't get an answer, there IS no answer....and here's why..." I have no more questions now that someone has addressed it. I know all about back vs forward testing and I do both, but I have to start somewhere with a brand new method. I can get a lot out of back testing some peaks and valleys of history a lot faster than watching 3 months of real time data in order to get any experience with a daily chart. When I do back test a certain time frame I also pull up a lower time frame chart and confirm which way the candles moved within that day, to see if something would have been stopped out or not etc. As soon as I get a feel for how I'm going to approach this method, I'll start watching realtime charts. That's just how I do things, in that order.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
OMG, i made an indicator for a naked system ^^ Basicaly it places dots on the high and low when there was a peak and valley. It does not repaint and it's basically just for the eye. sidenote : it's a bit quick and dirty so it might no be acurate...

Hi Melpheos, Not sure how your indicator differs from this S&amp;R indicator. On the chart they both look about the same.

Yes i know that is lame but i was bored and when i'm bored i do silly thing like making useless indicator and sending PM do Whtenn (someone will understand :lol:blush: That is possible i'll have a look. Edit : no it's different, mine gives peak/valley, the S&amp;R one seems to give peak and valley based on the zigzag indicator is you look at the settings. Mine is very very simple basically looking for a V or /\ shape.

Hello Kevin! First of all, it's not a waste of time! Second, of course some questions... I see the sell order was put after the first valley from 17 Jan. But, also a second valley formed in 17 Jan. Why, didn't you modify the sell order according to the new valley? How many pips bellow, did you considered when you placed these orders? Thanks!

I have been thinking on this way of trading for a some time . Its nice to see someone doing it . Less screen time more time for life . No indicators (only way to go) !! No trend lines ? No reading price action !! Very easy !! Thanks to all for your input ....SwingTrade65 has been trading this way for years ,must be working for them . After years of my face in a computer 8 to 12 hours a day trading this is will be a great . Blessings To All

interesting long term system.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hey dudes and dudettes, Thanks for all the nice words. "waste of time" was a poor choice of words on my part, and I honestly don't feel that way. This week I will be testing a trend catching filter I thought up that would allow me to pick and choose only the best 6 pairs everyday to trade based on what they did the previous day. In this way, I would stick to only trendy pairs and probably win more. I may discuss details on this if it turns out well. Here are my orders, I went Long GBP/USD last night, and my stop was almost hit, but I'm still here. Join me long, but don't blame me if we lose . Best of luck, Kevin

Today was a boring day in forex. Everyone is uncertain on where dollar is heading even though weaker housing market reports today suggest weaker dollars. As of now, I am still long GBP/USD at around break even, and also long EUR/USD at around break even. I don't have any orders quite set up yet, but pairs I may potentially enter given good conditions will be NZD/USD and AUD/USD. Everything else looks a little shaky to me.

Kevin, I am very pleased to have found this thread. Have been searching for and trying to put together,for a long time, a method that is a fit for me. Your method looks very promising since it incorporates most of what I need and allows for the use of some skills I have developed over the years. I especially like the idea that the market will come to me in this method. That, plus the fact I can only be in front of charts during the Asian session for the most part, requires a longer range view. I too use Oanda for its 'units' feature. We need to get Oanda to incorporate moving stops. I was going to ask you if you would do some 'trading with the trader' exercises, posting a trade and then following it up with commentary as it developed so those who wanted could follow along. And lo ' my wish is granted. Your commentary on this page was appreciated when you said words to the effect that not much was happening, because I had looked at PA and thought the same. Glad to know I wasnt missing anything ! Sincerely, Lou

Wow Markster, YOu have come to the right forum = Forex Factory. And may well, have landed in the right thread as far as trading style. But that remains to be a discovery for you to make. Look at the other threads, topics on the forum to find out what you need to know as a beginner about finding a broker and setting up a dealing desk. Folks are friendly here and very knowledgeable and can point you in expedient directions better than I. But what ever you do, add this thread by Kevin to your subscriptions so you can easily check in. Lou

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hey Markster, Welcome to the forum . Lou's right when he tells you this is the place to learn tons of ways to trade forex. There are countless possibilities and you will need to decide what works best for you. First, I'd pick up your basics at babypips.com, so at least you will understand some trader language and important concepts. Then, if you are interested by then check out all the threads on here and see if you can understand any of them . There are a lot. You will need practice. It's easy and not easy at the same time. You can try the method I'm using here which is pretty newbie friendly. As far as brokers, the only one I've had is Oanda, so I'm biased. There are plenty of discussions on this in the Brokers forum. The search box is your friend. Best of luck, Kevin Hey Lou, Thanks for the compliments and stopping by! Glad to be of some help. I will try and be a little more active around here to see if we can develop a little more of a live trading atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little news discussion along with potential opportunities and looks. As for now, I am still tweaking little things, but the main concepts are always there, and depending on the nature of my success, I will fill you guys in as I go. Oanda could definitely use trailing stops. I've never had this luxury, but with the longer timeframes it's not too big of an issue. When I trade shorter term, I sometimes find myself wanting them as well Many pips, Kevin

Hello everyone! And enormous thanks for showing your system! I`m newbie in fx, and looking for interesting strategies, and trying to work with them. But this sound one of the interesting ones... Just few questions that worries me. 1) I do understand the systems concept (I think so) just I can`t get the time to go in, because when I look at the graphs in the past, its clear when to go in (in line charts on 4H). But when I look at the tails of the candles (on the same time at candle chart on 1H) I see that there would be a stop from S/L (50 pips). 2) What is the average win/lose? 3) On what time and pairs does it work for more? Very appreciative for response and good luck dudes!!!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hello idejs, Thanks for stopping by, and I wish you luck as a new trader. Unfortunately, I neither have the time nor patience to teach you everything, so you're going to have to learn the basics yourself my friend. In my previous post for Markster, I suggest babypips. The information about this method is scattered throughout this thread so it will take a little work to discover how we trade it. I have no averages for you, and as a newbie it would be wise of you to start with longer term time frames, but I've seen people do it differently. Once you have learned the basics and you find you may still have a question, feel free to ask me, but as I said, I usually don't hold peoples' hands on their path to make them money. Basically that would be working for nothing . Best of luck to you, Kevin

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Thanks Kevin for the reply!!! I`m sorry for my confusing style of language. I went through the whole thread, and tried to understand. My main question is, am I doing something wrong or is it true, that there have to be very huge range of S/L. That mostly could be even bigger than possible T/P? Best wishes to everyone and lot of pips!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hello Idejs, In order to answer your stoploss question... what do you consider a big range? Stop loss settings on this method are not determined by the number of pips, but by past price action as you read in the thread. Placing the SL bit lower than the last valley in a long trade. Where to exit is totally up to you. But you might also look at price action in the past to see what happened at a certain price. Especially where price is consolidating over several time periods. So if over time price returns to a certain level where it has been in the past, see what happened there. Did buyers or sellers come into the market, driving the price up or down? If your SL seems that it would use too much of your equity if it gets hit, then either pass on the trade or trade smaller lots ... less than a dollar. (Only some brokers allow this however.) When you looked at Kevin's entrys and trades you might have seen that he traded for example 1000 units (this is with Oanda ). Depending on the pair, this could be, 10 cents a pip. Some thoughts: As a beginner, use a demo account ONLY to learn how to use the software, charting, placing an order, closing a position and so forth. When you start to trade, after you know how to use the charting package, trade with very small amounts... as above maybe 10 cents a pip. Especially if you have a small account. This will give you a better feel for the psychology of trading. Using a demo account does not really get your mind and emotions into it. Whereas trading with your own real money will be different. But as a novice trader, it is much better to make a 10 cent a pip mistake than a dollar a pip mistake. Hope this helps. Lou

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thanks Lou! That was the thing I wanted to hear. Only now work, work and work to learn when to go in the trade (open an order). To find the place where to open and earn not to lose! Thanks to everyone for this discussion about this strategy. This is really helpful for the beginners like me.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I'm watching for a breakout either way on this pair. Whats everyone watching?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hey bogus, I don't get NZD/JPY with Oanda, so I don't know what to tell you there. In my pending orders however, I have a couple long orders against JPY. Right now I am still long GBP/USD, got stopped out of EUR/USD for -14 pips after I moved my S/L a little too close, and am long AUD/USD and NZD/USD. There will be a lot of news today, which can be a good thing or bad thing, but hopefully it leads to a trend one way or the other.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
My USD/JPY long trade at 107.06 that I put on this morning has been waffling around all day. Now as negative as it has been since then. I think I will hold on. Went against the overall trend with this one. Dont usually do that.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
i've got a silly idea about this valley and peak method, could we do this....... 1) buy and sell the same pair at same time. 2) add more units to winning side using peak or valley. 3) when the trend of the winning side seems to be ending then close out both buy and sell. the extra units on the winning side would give an overall profit. so is this worth any further thinking ?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
the last couple days is so slow........and yet i make mistakes that would have given me profits if i didn't notice the mistake in the first place............. ........definitely not good........once again, all those hours watching the screen made me tired and as usual, mistakes come when i'm tired......... so should the FED cut rates again would your usd/jpy long be a good idea ?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
findcount, Everyone was a little nervous about where price was heading before all the news today, so it makes things a little risky to trade. It's a good idea to know what's coming up with news along with what the trend is and pretty soon I may disclose my strategy for determining active, trending pairs, and trading accordingly. All my orders were hit well before news that I had set last night, so I was a little bit nervous, but the market tends to sway just a touch before news sometimes, and I just happened to be right this time. Dollar and yen took a beating after interest rate release. Fortunately, my portfolio hates the dollar and the yen things can always change; never get too comfortable...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I'm not by far an experienced trader, but if it helps, I'll try an answer to your dilemma. 1) The problem with the 2 orders is the spread. From the start you have a sure loss. 2) Following what method you determine which is the winning side? Why not enter from the first place in the direction of the winning side, if you have such a method? and, 3) How will you know exactly when the trend is over? Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
No.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
all carries gave nice signal some time ago, let's see if we can break 209.. If we can, I'll welcome 200.. . If not, 213.20 would be next long..

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I still don't understand peoples affinity for having positions in both directions open at the same time. I'd much rather just be out of the market than have both positions in. First, you're making your broker more money in commissions. Second, you're always going to incur some more slippage just due to your fills. Sometimes the correct play is to stand aside, let the market tell you what to do, don't try to predict.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
@Kevin Could you walk through your process of your evaluation of the trend on the Dailies and Weeklies? Are you zooming out and looking at the big picture with those time frames, or are you looking at the more intermediate trend? For instance, on Cable, I'd say Weekly is in an intermediate downtrend but the longer term trend is up. On the daily, I'd say we're in a down trend from October, with an intermediate up trend. Thanks a bunch, I just don't want to fall into the old habit of slapping a MA on the chart :-)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Well the hindsight answer to that was ... no. In this method one must pay attention to the fundamentals. What was I thinking?!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hey there, There are many ways to determine the long-term trend, and I believe each trader should determine it differently based on how many times you wish to enter. For instance, if you trade with the reeaaaaallly long-term trend(weekly), then odds are you won't be changing your position very often, and thus will be entering less. I believe there may be benefits to this method as swingtrade65 mentions earlier, such as improved accuracy. As for me, I'm testing a little thing I thought up that involves heiken ashi bars and utilizes the previous day's trend STRENGTH to determine today's entries. It's pretty easy and straight forward, but I want to make sure it would make pips. For now, I've been getting my butt handed to me, but it's to be expected during such volatile times. You win some you lose some At any rate, here are my orders for tonight and tomorrow. I lost 3 trades in the quick swings today.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Kevin, I put on a long NZD/USD earlier tonight .. with entry just above the peak of the 1 sma at 7850. Now I see you put your entry above the spike up at .7918 . That seemed pretty far away for my taste especially as to how the N/U seems to be moving lately. I also put on a short E/J at 157.50 Lou

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Finally, we get some volatility..

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi racekfx, I was wondering whether you only entered on the close of the 4 hour candle, and didn't have standing orders so as not to be taken into a trade by a spike? Thanks, Bogus

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi Kevin, I've got a question regarding the P&amp;V's . I've noticed I can have higher P&amp;Vs on the close of the candle but have lower P&amp;Vs on bar charts. I'm not sure which has more relevance. I'm focusing on entries which I think is important because of setting my stoploss, especially on the higher timeframes. It's been a hard week with the spikes. Cheers, Bogus

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi bogus, short answer is no... I'm a PA trader where S/R plays a major role, so my charts look more like the one below. I take aggressive possition on touches of s/r, PBs, beovbs/buovbs, fibs and confluence. P &amp; V only complements my trading so I may add on a break of pick and/or valley.... Arrow in squares would be my initial positions. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Jd.. I think your pm was answered more clearly with my previous post... .... next short would be around 2.1290/2.1320 if new valley forms. This area is near price pivot (or resistance if you will - 2.1230), so we may see a strong bounce and perhaps I would close most of my position there.. hope this helps..

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi raczekfx, when did you draw the horizontal at 2.1591 in your post # 280 chart. Do you ever exchange ideas with Akuma99 about your trading methods? Lou

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hey Lou, top one on Jan 17, the lowest on Jan 23, the one at 2.1591 on Jan22. no, I never read Akumas methods.... . I've only been looking at P &amp; V and J16 chart threads recently. The others haven't caught my interest for a quite while.. . r

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thanks, it does.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Kharvell, thanks for starting this great thread - has had me thinking all weekend and looking forward to using this strategy. Raczekfx, regarding your peaks and valleys trades,are you placing entries solely on the break of the peak or valley as in your line charts or using the relevant bar high or low?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hey guys, Raczekfx, nice trading man! I especially like that you are using S/R levels. Keep posting and keep up the good work. Trumpcard, thanks for stopping by and many pips to you. I'm just stopping in here briefly. I found another thread that uses very similar methodology with a built in trend filter. It's quite similar to what we are using here, but just thought I'd put it here since it is relevant and another way at looking at the same thing. The user "ducks" posted it and credit will go to Leslie Hampton who wrote it. Here's a link: http://forexfactory.com/showpost.php...04&amp;postcount=3 Best of luck, Kevin

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello Kevin, When you state that ducks methods have a built in trend filter you are still talking about price, right? As in the example for a long trade when price breaks the ' 2 ' level at number ' 4 ' . Or are you referring to something else? Lou

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hey Lou, Yes, I am still talking about price. But more so the fact that with the 1-2-3-4 method, you wait for a higher/lower peak/valley. The condition that wave # 3 must be a higher high or lower low than wave #1 basically entails that there is a trend in the given direction, and a break of 2, which is what we normally do, makes for a good entry. Make sense? Best of luck, Kevin PS ENJOY the superbowl everyone!!! GO GIANTS

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Kevin, please check this out: So isthe KEY price action at point 3 ? For example: In a long situation price has bounced short off of point 2. BUT at point 3 price has not dipped back into point 1 's territory. As price moves off of point 3 in a long direction ... is this the filter? So then when price crosses the point 2 level at point 4 the trade has a better chance of success? ?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Closed my N/U long for 70 pips or so. Price was retreating off of an upper channel ascending trend line going back to Nov 5 in the area from 7850 to currently 7950 on the Daily. Price has hit this area 3 times and retreated since Nov 5, some may even say since October. Price is reatreating today. 3 hr chart. It is an interesting dilemma. Fundies say the commodity pairs should start moving vs USD. But technically speaking that rising channel trendline has caused price to reverse time and again. Will look at getting back in if that trendline breaks. Lou

--- 帖子 #291 ---
anyone taking the euro short now using this method?

Here are my orders. I am still long NZD/USD with 2 positions. By the looks of my daily chart shown below, resistance has been broken assuming things stay the same. I believe they will stay the same as I believe there will be a weaker dollar still yet. I've also got a long AUD/USD and long AUD/JPY position.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I like the long A/U position. Appears to avoid my problems with the N/U. Above.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Take a look at the poll results for Trading Naked above... Fibonacci ratio. Moving more and more towards trading naked. But , Can I leave my hat on?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hey Lou, Fib's are overrated . And please feel free to use your hat as you see fit! Looks like you may have been right about that strong resistance holding for NZD/USD. There is a lot of important news tonight for AUD and some for NZD, so I've tightened my stops and am planning for the worst. With my luck, I'll probably get whipsawed out, but better a small loss than a big one. My orders and such are below. If both of my stops are hit on NZD/USD, I'll probably walk out with around 70 pips or so like you. Pairs I hope to enter tomorrow are Long AUD/USD (again), Long AUD/JPY (again), and Short EUR/AUD (again). These of course all assuming we stay in the direction which I believe they will head. But then again, a lot of news especially with AUD coming out in the next hour or so. Regards, Kevin

A/U Who the heck is selling? I thought a rate increase would spur buying.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
oh wow did i get whipped by the aussie....god damn 30 pip spreads stopped me out

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Lol 60 pips in 5 minutes (shown below) I survived by 25 or so pips Tough luck wz. Do you use Oanda as well? I saw those guys tried that funny business and was glad I was already in. It may not be a bad idea to try again since they bumped up their interest by .25%.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
not sure why you're stopped out (unless you're scalping... ), but we just had a break out few days ago at .9016, so reasonable stop would be below that number. Some... added more on retest of that ppz as Seeking would say 'price moved back to pick up grandma'. Some would expect price to stall around .9100 as price printed that low on nov.1/2007... happy trading...

--- 帖子 #301 ---
ya i use oanda and no i wasn't scalping. i've been in since last night, around this time. i just tightened my stop because who knows what the statement that follows the rates will be.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
How much of a bite did they take? I was talking with them the other day and their forumla is If stopped out during wide spread take half the wide spread and add it to the spread that you got in at.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Thought the drop would not hit my SL ... so went to work optimistic as price seemed to be rising after the overnight downmove. About 3 hrs later the bottom fell out. - 88 pips. Sure wish O anda had trailing stops.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Kevin, i was scouting around when i found another method by you - the one using multiple bollinger bands ? seems interesting though, but what happened to it ? this valley + peak method managed to trump it ?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Other traders are wondering about the Aussie and Kiwi. Why the Aussie didnt go up with the rate increase and US decrease. Has anyone used COT as a sort of filter? Noticed at PFX Global that although institutional investors are long on both of these pairs, sentiment is bearish. So a mixed bag. However institutional investors are once again long on Cable and Sentiment has just turned bullish this week. So I wonder when that influence will kick in and effect price as we see it? Lou

--- 帖子 #306 ---
It took some time (8 days) to get down to 1.94 again.... and entire move started with 2 daily pins...

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I'm currently up +100 on a short I snagged on EUR/JPY this morning. Took the break of the valley around 155.30

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi Swingtrade65, I am very encouraged by how well you do trading this method. I strongly believe in trend following systems but am having difficulty determining the weekly trend that you have suggested for this system. According to the methodology, we will initiate a long order when a previous peak is broken. This is marked out by the red horizontal line on the chart that I have attached. However, on hindsight, the main uptrend started around 19 Feb 2006, and the trend would have well been in place by the time it broke the resistance (horizontal line). May I ask how you determine the weekly trend in this case - by rising prices in general or only by the break of the previous peak? Does the same go for the daily trend? Looking forward to your advice. Thanks alot in advance. Regards.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
My question is with all the different systems you have described in the past, how would you rate this system compared to those?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
well, Kevin is an old hand so his system always make sense. i would say this is not even a system but is common sense and logic. i may be wrong but i think this peak and valley would be really good especially just after a break out and of course one must take note of the daily S+R as they are potential obstacles to profit so when peaks/valleys are near S+R, perhaps it's best to avoid them. so far Daily produces too little action and potential SL is BIG, maybe 3hr or even 1 hr is best. reason why i think it's best after a breakout is obvious - pullbacks will be smaller and momentum is good. anyone can suggest the best timeframe ?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I look all the time frames but but keep coming back to the hourly or even less for good entries. A good example is the hourly on G/J from 209.50 to 208.65. Some nice trades bouncing up and down waiting for the big break. Any thoughts on which way this will move when it comes?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Looking at the 3hr why not put a buy just above 209.60 and a sell below 208.50 , the areas of the last peak and valley. Or you might want to look back at the last move of price off of Support or Resistance and take a direction based on that.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I wouldn't recommend 1hr or 4hr unless you can make money on daily TF. Speaking of which... unless we break 207.70, I wouldn't be surprised to see gj testing 213 again.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Where did you get 207.70?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
from last Wed's low and valley on Thur.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
you're asking the wrong guy (which is me) for advice.........the old hands here can offer you the really useful advice. but nowadays, all the pairs seems to be much more 'responsive' to the Dow Jones so keeping long term positions must be done on the daily charts only. on 1hr charts, you got to take your profit before you go to bed and perhaps the last order will be a loss. so am i the only one noticing that many pairs are now much more 'responsive' to the Dow or am i spouting nonsense again ?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
JPY crosses are very much correlated to the Dow Jones and also (to a lesser extent) to FTSE, DAX, CAC. This is due to the degree of risk aversion of investors (carry trade). By the way, great thread Kevin, keep up the good work

I rarely post but felt compelled to do so because it seems that one of the rare quality threads on this forum (this one), is dying out. I can understand, though... I mean, it's too simple and couldn't possibly work. Where are all the bells and flashing lights? THIS certainly couldn't be the holy-grail because it's too primitive. What was KHARVEL thinking? OK... Enough sarcasm... Here are the results of trading this system LIVE last week - Fri 2/8 - Fri 2/15: PAIR -------- W / L -- RESULT EUR/USD - 3 / 0 ..... + 81 EUR/CHF -- 3 / 0 ..... + 113 GBP/CHF -- 4 / 2 ..... + 219 EUR/AUD -- 4 / 2 ..... -28 EUR/JPY ----- 4 / 3 ..... + 81 AUD/CAD ---2 / 1 ..... + 51 GBP/USD --- 3 / 3 ..... -14 GBP/JPY ----- 7 / 2 ... + 333 AUD/JPY ----- 4 / 2 ..... + 9 NZD/USD --- 1 / 1 ..... -16 EUR/CAD ---- 1 / 3 ..... -75 USD/JPY ----- 1 / 3 ..... -87 CHF/JPY ------3 / 1 ..... + 17 USD/CAD --- 1 / 0 .... + 79 AUD/USD --- 2 / 1 .... + 87 USD/CHF --- 1 / 0 ..... + 16 TOTAL (W) 44 (L) 24 (P/L) +866 I believe that +866 for the WEEK qualifies as "pretty good". Oh... did I mention last week was +411, the week before +207 and the week before that +233 (All LIVE) and that was while I was testing several scenarios. ALL WORKED. Oozing sarcasm aside - My intention is absolutely NOT to brag but to try and show that (1) THIS "SYSTEM" WORKS and (2) It's NOT the indicators - It's YOU!... The "Holy Grail" is - YOU! THANK YOU KHARVEL FOR BRING THE BASICS BACK TO LIFE!!! (Note for NEWBIES: There are MANY quality traders who posted in this thread... Studying their thought process might be worth your while) I have to admit, however, that my chart is somewhat complicated and extremely difficult to read... want to see it (more sarcasm ) ? http://forexfactory.com/home/theline...ics/charts.gif

excellent stuff freevey... i think the best thing in forex is MM and with a simple system and MM works well... though I am struggling on the MM side of things and time frame, which once I have cracked, will be good to go live. can I ask you a couple of questions. 1. what time frames are you using? 2. how many pairs are you trading at a time? 3. most important... what MM are using? thanks guess

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hello All.....This thread has been an enormous help to me. Not that I have mastered anything, but for the first time, I can make decisions based on PA with a good amount of confidence. I have always been fond of the straddle and I know the best traders let their trades run and add to their winning positions as they go. Until I came to this thread, I couldn't make that work.......now I can. Thanks again........

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hey freevy, I found your chart very enlightening. Really ! I am interested too in the time you watch the charts. Are you placing market orders or limit orders? Trailing stops? Not able to utilize trailing stops is the bain of my trading. Especially with the E/U and A/U lately. Winners turn around before I can get to close them. Lou

--- 帖子 #323 ---
- I trade on 4H only. I do not look at other time frames - I watch all 16 pairs I've showed results on - As far as MM... After I determine entry, next I set stop loss (S/L). If S/L is 75 and I don't feel COMPLETELY comfortable that I can get AT LEAST 75 pips on T/P side... I'll pass the trade. Usually I'll look for 50(S/L) with 75(T/P) ; 75(S/L) with 90(T/P), etc... Kharvel stated that he likes to go for "home runs". I, on the other hand, CAN'T STAND watching GBP/JPY go +85 then in 10 min stop me out at break-even. It makes me want to vomit... Literally . So I set, what I consider for me, reasonable targets and I go with those. This is a matter of personality, I believe. This is probably why they don't call me "Iceman" I've attached a chart... might be a bit out of proportion LOU... Attached is an EA which I use to manage the trades. Takes Profit, Moves stops, Trails at the end. Open it with MetaEditor and you'll find instructions for settings... I hope it helps you (and others). I know newbies get excited about EAs.. but please be sure you know the basics of how EAs work (i.e. If power goes out... you have no stops, etc...) before using it. Credit goes to "stockwet" for original EA code. I modified a bit.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
BTW... I just realized that, on the chart I posted above, the way it stands right now... It is a very nice setup. 1) Lower/Valley ; Lower/Peak close 2) Entry 3-5 bellow valley 3) S/L 3-5 of peak (or above the green bar high is more like it) 4) In my case, I would set a T/P of 1:1 or 1:1.5 risk/reward... Or just let it go until you see the trend slowing or reversing (advanced) Yessssss... It's almost time for market to open Happy harvest all.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
That’s very true.. This method is very simple yet delivers good returns, but for many, it’s too good to be true.. . P &amp; V delivers outstanding results if you add some common sense to your trading.. e.g. S/R. For many people it’s just too simple to qualify for a trading system. No fancy indicators, no confirmations….. so people start new threads with ‘the new, best system ever’. Then, they spend 99% of their time proving their system works… and after few months they move to another best system.. . After many years of blown accounts they quit trading for good... or go back to basics (Price)and eventually realize that simple stuff works the best… well done.. freevey

Hi Freevey, Very nice results using very simple techniques...well done. My question is since you trade from the 4 hr chart do you only trade in the direction of the overall trend as determined by the daily or weekly chart or do you stricly use peaks and valleys on 4 hr and trade whatever signals are given from your trading time frame?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I look at the 4H only. I've found that interpretation of multi-time frame trends is so subjective, that I ended up staring at a perfect setup but not pulling the trigger because I was questioning the overall trends. This is definitely one area I'd like to improve. For now... I just keep it SIMPLE. So I just look at the 4H... I don't anticipate the break-out or reversal. I let it happen, then enter on the first pull back. If it makes a higher peak/higher valley (reverse for shorts) - that's good enough for me. I would, however, first look for major resistance. If the peak is at or near resistance, I won't take it. Then I'll wait for a reversal to happen, wait for the first pull-back, then go short. That's it. Certainly, I miss the initial power move and sometimes, it just keeps going with no breather... That's OK. That's why I look at 16 pairs. Hell, even with missing the initial move, I still had 68 trades last week. I can't help but wonder if I'm over-trading it a bit. BTW... 4H is just my pref. Hourly cuts into my golf/girls time and Daily is not enough action for me. I do, however, set my alarm and catch the new 4H bar while I'm sleeping. 4H for me was not scientific. This is why I wanted to make sure this thread stays alive and we keep our top-traders posting here. KHARVEEEEEEELL... COME BAAAAAAAAAACK !!!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
freevey. Thanks for giving this thread a transfusion. Thanks for the EA . However my account is not with an mt4 provider. Unless you know of one that allows micro lots. Then I might change from O. Sounds like you dont sleep much.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
FXDD offers micro-lot accounts, and is an mt4 provider.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Thanks, what are their ' Issues ' ?. Every broker has issues. I will look into them.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Freevey, I like your style. I take it from your posts that you place an order on 4 hour candle close so as not to get drawn into a false trade (?)I like the 4hr timeframe too and see getting in on a new candle as a way of keeping the stoploss small even though I might miss a few.Is this correct? Cheers, Bogus

--- 帖子 #332 ---
No idea . . . I've only used them for a demo account. There's also a thread entitled "MT4 brokers offering micro account?" in the Broker Discussion forum.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
This approach has been covered with slightly different entry methods and a whole theory called 'The Law of Charts' by Joe Ross - google either if you are interested as there are free PDF's covering his method.

Thanks guys.

I would like a discussion on MM, SL and TP if anyone is interested... I am looking to fine tune MM. TF 4hours MM 1. place two times 0.1 lot per trade SL 1. both with SL either of previous low or high (related to peak or valley) 2. SL to 50 pips for both trades TP 1. first 0.1 lot 50 pips 2. Once +50 pips, move to BE and let position ride This is just a start, I'm sure some of you people will have better ideas, win/loss ratio is what we are also looking at, so winners will eat losers! thanks, guess

Hey guys, I haven't been around here for a while, and there is a reason for it. I have been working on developing my own site. To be completely honest, and I realize I may come off as selfish, but helping other people make money for free is tedious for me. I've put a lot a time into everything I know, and I'm realizing that it is worth something to me. I'm not into shamelessly advertising especially in a forum where there are clear cut rules NOT to advertise, so if you MUST get information about my site, please feel free to contact me (best by PM), but I will not post the link here. I really just want to say thanks to everyone for the encouragement along the way. It is true that this is all very simple, and I noticed the thread was dying until freevey started posting (Great job BTW freevey ). What I guess I've been asking myself is "Is it worth my time to constantly keep my thread on life support with every post I make?" and my answer was "No". I will more than likely still be around here posting, but my main focus will be my own site. Best of luck to everyone, Kevin

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Kevin, You are an honest guy ! I wanted to thanks you for the system you contributed here. I took it and some tips from the 1-2-3-4 system you gave the link here, and I try to make the best of it. You showed us the way, we shall go on by ourselves from here. Thanks, Dani_M BTW, Joshua lead the the Israeli people after Moses crossed them the desert, So, freevey, can we call you Joshua ? Dani_M

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Ummm... Joshua?!? Do they all end up rich in the end? Kharvel must have heard me yelling for him a few posts ago . Honestly, my reasons for not posting much are about the same as Kevin's (minus the web site). I read what more experienced traders have to say and use it to try and improve my trading. I've posted exactly how I trade and I'd be happy to help others, as I have learned MUCH from those who posted before me. Hey... Did that sound like Moses? If I can help, let me know.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
(PM I received) I'll answer it here in case others have the same question. As discussed early in the thread, my "signal" line is the bar average. Just put 1SMA on "Median Price (HL/2)". Again... I only use 4H BOGUS...Yes, I wait for the retracement bar to close. This way I know for sure that the valley is fixed, then (1) I determine my stop loss, then (2) determine if I feel I can easily do better than 1:1 risk/reward for T/P - if yes, then (3) place the buy stop order then (4) Attach the EA to manage the trade.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Thanks freevey.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Dani, Thanks for thanking me . I'm glad you have found my time here helpful. I couldn't help but laugh at your analogy to Moses and Joshua . I'll be more than happy if freevey takes over, and I'll just chime in on important points. Forex Factory is too good to cut off completely Regards, Kevin

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hey Moses,... er... Kevin I'd like to ask you a small favor though. Can you please take a quick look at my posts / chart on prev page and tell me if that's close to the way you still trade this method. If not... it wouldn't make much sense for me to take the thread in the direction I trade. Newcomers will start reading your thread, expect one thing... then get something else after 30 pages. Your comments on what's similar or what's different would be much appreciated. At least that way, newcomers can see which direction the thread went. I'm sure Moses told Joshua a few things about the people, before handing them over (umm... Is that what happened?... Well.. as longs as they all get rich in the end ). Thanks

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Freevey, Feel free to do whatever you'd like man. I'd have to say, I've read your last posts and you've definitely got the right idea. I stated my purpose of this thread from post #1. To help you really notice your chart in its simplest form: naked. As long as this is the general theme of things, it's all good. If you would like to create something where you have a bit more ownership, go for it as well. I would say that one thing that you are emphasizing that I never really did is to pay attention to Risk:Reward, which ultimately plays into Money Management. Also, you seem to have placed more emphasis on support/resistance which is also a very good idea. All in all, I'm impressed my friend, and I look forward to hearing from you in the future. I myself have gone off in a different direction using shorter timeframes(5-minute) with similar methodology to keep me only in the market at 5-10 minute intervals. Regards, Kevin

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Today was a rangy day. Is that a word? At least it was for EUR/USD that was caught between 1.4665 and 1.4645. It made for some sloppy short-term trading on my part, but later on when the break out occurred, I had a chance to make some good profits. Keeping losses small will take you far.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
whoa whoa whoa...kevin that's a lot of MA's. what happened to trading naked?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi Moses, Joshua and the rest of the people, I have just read Mark Duoglas's book "Trading in the Zone" in order to help myself become a consistent profitable trader. He asked the readers to do a line of at least 20 trades following exactly the rules of the system in order to make us believe in our system, and to better know the Win/Lose ratio. So, I started it this week, and I will post the results here. I'm looking at the 4H graphs, with any available pair as freevey suggested.

Lou, you can take a look at Alpari as well. I was tossing up between them and Oanda when I went live and ended up with Oanda; However, there are often times that I regret being with them though for various reasons but will stick it out for a bit longer. Give Alpari a look over. Oromis.

Freevey, I was trying to understand your chart and was wondering if you could please clarify for me, my comment/questions in red. Thanks and appreciate your help.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
TheHedge, I personally use the break of the peak of the average line.....I rarely even have any bars on my charts...only 1 line...the average price Hope this helps. I also like Kevin have been absent for a few weeks and the reasoning for me was very simple.....I was spending way too much time away from trading and my focus on making money for my account....that may sound pretty selfish, but that is afterall why I am in this crazy game.... Many Pips to All

Hi swingtrade, Thanks for your reply. Your explanation has indeed cleared things up. Do you apply this to all timeframes including daily and 4-hourly, i.e. median price? Do not worry about not being able to post often. Neither you nor Kevin are obliged to reply to every post here. In fact, we are all more than grateful for sharing your insights with us who desire to learn. Thanks to all.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
People, My broker, ODL (MT4), doesn't allow closing part of the trade, so managing take profit at several prices is impossible, unless you open multiple orders for the same trade and close them one by one as your trade advances. Please take a look at the following link. this guy developed a brilliant tool that may make our lives much easier because it allows you to set the price, and the orders will be opened automatically when the price reaches that point. For us (users of this thread), the entry price is well known, and we know it hours before we enter a trade. We can use this EA , get a voice alert when the price was reached and the trade orders were executed. All that we have to do is to manage the take profit. What do think ?

I'll do it for you Kev... right here

--- 帖子 #357 ---
My trading IS discretionary. I'll post my thoughts first, then I'll post the mechanics. If you want to make this REALLY simple... (I'll talk in terms of "LONG" - use reverse for "short"). Trade it as originally posted. Just use the 1SMA on "Median Price", entry on break of peak, stop just below the valley or 50 pip S/L for all... (the way SWINGTRADE mentioned)... and let it ride (you will need some experience to know when to stop letting it ride) The way I learned to trade it: I sat down with EVERY one of the 16 pairs, on 4H, went back as far as it will go and went bar-by-bar-by-bar, voicing out loud - "OK.. it made a higher peak, there is the pullback, I would enter here, stop here, etc..." or "there's the pullback... click... now it made a lower peak, stay out and see what it does... click... there's a lower valley, might be reversing, wait for pullback... click... there it is... entry here, stop here... click... oops reversed again, no entry, etc... etc... etc..." for every one of them... You will be AMAZED at how you get the "feel" for it. On MM: I started out with 2 lots. Sell one at 50 let the other ride... S/L at 50, The problem is is that when you get stopped out at 50 - it's actually 100 pips total. But when you hit the 50 T/P and hit - let's say 100 with second lot - that's a 75 total. Or worse... You hit the 50 T/P on first and stopped out at break-even on 2nd... Your losses always end up being bigger than your gains. You can't trade at 60/40 or even 70/30 and make any money that way. So with multi-lots, you have to make sure that your winners average out much MORE than your losses. My style of trading: I don't have a day job. I certainly don't have - NOR WANT - a wife for 2nd income and I'm not "trying out this trading thing". I want to make sure I make money on regular basis. Once I hit my base targets, I use the "overage" - if any - to "let it ride". So I use set T/P. AGAIN... This is not a "right / wrong" thing. Just - ME. And the only way to get to know "YOU" is to do it. I wanted to say all that, so that, when I post charts, you guys know that it's only what is right for ME and my thought process. You do as you wish. Next post will the mechanics...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Answer to Post #350 - (Good question Oromis - It's easy to put up a chart "after-the-fact" ) - DISCRETION: This is why I added bars to my chart, instead of "Line Chart" only. NOTE: I agree with Kevin's original 50 S/L as a minimum. On 4H time-frame, anything tighter, other than, maybe on EUR/USD, and a couple of other slow-movers, is not enough. 1st chart shows a shallow pullback - so I use the pull-back BAR for entry and stop. Break of bar (3-5) for entry - break of other side (3-5) for stop. 2nd chart is a deeper pull-back - so I use the valley and peak. For T/P, must keep in mind the upcoming support at 207.00. From entry to that level, there is room for, may be, 100 -125 pips. I want to make sure that I hit my T/P so I'll set it at, may be 90. So I have better than 1:1 risk/reward and I'm not being greedy and trying to squeeze every pip out of it. How I learned to use discretion?... Read my last post.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hey Freevey, Good job with posting how you trade this. It's good to see other views. I do have a question though. Do you only trade this looking for range breakouts? Seems to me that the charts you posted have price in some sort of range, then it breaks out and forms a valley/peak and then you wait for your pullback for confirmation. So do you trade just regular valleys/peaks when price is just trending? What I mean is, say you're not in a trade for pair XXX/XXX and price is moving along and has created a peak/valley. How would you (or would you at all) trade that? Just curious. (I hope I make some sense ) Take care, Tom

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Yes... I definitely wait for price to break out - then I wait for a pull-back - then look for entry. I am, however, trying out range break out as we speak - with mini-lots though. Like GBP/USD is looking RIGHT-NOW.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I'll like to thank Kevin for posting this system and everyone that made a contribution. following price is really the key to the mint and thank God i know that now (after burning down 4 live a/c). Maybe you guys should read trend following by Michael Covel. reading that book helped me a lot. i could upload the softcopy for you guys. anyways after going through the thread, i placed my 1st trade on Gbp/Jpy and i made 70 pips (demo) and right now am long Gbp/Usd.. anybody in that trade?

Hi raczekfx, The AU seems to be very close to the highest price it had for long time . It may become a strong resistance that will start a price fall. If this is the case, the little valley you found is good entry point. Just the way I see it. BR Dani_M

Thanks for the clarrification.

DAN_MIR... I wasn't saying tighter stops were wrong and you should "watch out". I wanted to know how you trade with tighter stops... i.e. - if you found a way to use a tighter stop (keeping losses small ) and still make decent gains. Thanks. SOMEBODY out there is TALKIN' . Word got out... My last 4 of 6 were losses where I got triggered by (no joke) 3-5 pips on EVERY one of them, then reversed on the next bar straight the other way. It's like THEY know... I don't know who THEY are but I do know that THEY are out there.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Dani_M Just a question... in your situation regarding closing a part of a trade, can you place a sell order for say half of your original order, assuming it was a buy. So when the sell is hit, half your trade is taken off, with the rest still riding. Or if your broker doesnt allow fractional positions, then never mind.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Sorry ODL, I spoke with their support a few hours ago, and they show me the way to do it. I can close part of the trade and take partial profit. I will triple my trade size, and close it third after third if it goes in the right direction. otherwise, SL will close it all. BR Dani_M

kevin do you still use indicators? any form of indicator?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
It depends how I'm trading ... Right now I'm trading off of 5-minute and 1-minute chart, so I use Std. Deviation to detect volatility. Volatility is more of a factor on shorter timeframes. One could also use bollinger bands, which are based off of standard deviations. I also have a 20 moving average on my chart, but it's not used very much. Just to tell me where price has been the most over the last 20 periods. EDIT: Images not working, let me see what I can do here.. http://forexfactory.com/attachment.p...6&amp;d=1203621442

Here’s a situation. We have U/C for today. As it can be seen there are several consecutive formations of peaks and valleys. If we are going to place our pending buy and sell orders with the normal stop losses for them (45-50 pips), they would be too large in these conditions of the market, resulting in the overlapping of the orders. These can lead to a scenario in which there are open simultaneously a buy and a sell order. I hope I made myself clear. Any of you more experienced traders are free to answer. I’m looking forward! Btw, a great day today for P&amp;V, although I missed some opportunities.

Hi people, Mid of day 5 update. My results aren't good. I will use the weekend for back testing the reasons for it. The Win/Lose ratio is fine 26/16, but profit is 520/-920 ($). It means that the trades weren't handled right. I will read more about money management as well. BR Dani_M

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I ended up with 22/18 Win/Loss for +92. What I changed this week is... In the weeks past I've always waited for the initial break-out to happen, then waited for a pull back and THEN entered or waited for an obvious trend reversal, then looked for a pull-back. This week, I straddled the "range" trying to catch the initial move and "anticipated" the reversals. More aggressive, this week. And more greedy . More forward testing will tell the story. Have a great weekend all.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Are you pyramiding your entries? Personally I have found this makes up for the many small losses. You get one big fat win when you catch a good trend. See my post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=156 and http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=204

Hey guys, I must begin to say that this thread is under rated. The peak and valley method seems to be a simple and effective method throughout all forms of trading. Let it be Forex, Stocks or Futures.. One just need to know how to apply it correctly. Kudos to kharvell for initiating this thread. Ok here goes, I have used this concept a couple of times and it does reap some good profit, especially with the pyramiding. That is just a wonder. However, I have a question on the order price. What would be the best order price to use? In this thread I have seen 3 possible orders to use: 1) to Buy 3-5 pips above the peak of the close price 2) to Buy 3-5 pips above the peak of the median price 3) to Buy 3-5 pips above the high of the peak bar I know some of you will say to each is own. I just want to know if there is really a difference or is there a preferred entry. Thanks to everyone for their contribution. Regards, Gyfu

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi everybody! I've been following this thread for some time. I am very sad that almost everybody abandoned searching. I trade myself this way so I will share few things with you guys. My thoughts about pyramiding; It's true that pyramiding gives you great opportunities but unless every week is like the first week of January 2008 on GBP/JPY, on the long run you will loose. Because pyramiding needs a huge SL. Also, you are adding positions without locking the profits. (unless you managed to enter 2 trades and know exactly were to exit the first one and when to set the second at BE) Those who managed to trade this way are the lucky guys, as for me I didn't so I sticked to only one trade. I'll talk more about SL later on but I don't have time right now PS: Sorry for my bad English, it's only my third tongue.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hey guys, I might be wrong here, but I assumed that when you keep entering trades in the same direction, you also move your stops when new peaks/valleys form. That way your SL remains "normal" and you're adding to a winner while going with the trend. Isn't that the general idea or am I off? Tom

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I might be wrong here, but I assumed that when you keep entering trades in the same direction, you also move your stops when new peaks/valleys form. That way your SL remains "normal" and you're adding to a winner while going with the trend. That's my understanding too.....the SL moves with you as you pyramid.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
After doing some little researches on managing the trades I come with the following proposal for the TP and SL. The TP and SL should of course be set in such a way that a good money management must be followed. So, assuming you are risking in every trade maximum 2.5% of your account and following the so called rule “let your profits run”, I think that a ratio of 1:1 for the SL and TP should be enough for about 70% of your position, and let the rest of 30% for extra bonuses. Example: in a case of a long trade a SL of about 30 pips is given by a previous formed valley, the TP for the 70% of the position will be about 42 pips. So, if the market goes against us, we will loose the 30 pips. If it goes in our favor we will close 70% of our position at about 42 pips. In this moment we will move our SL to BE and let the rest of 30% run. The idea behind this kind of entry is that the value of the ratio TP/SL must be somewhere around 1.4:1, giving a total per position of a ratio equal to 1:1. More examples: SL=15, TP=20 SL=20, TP=28 SL=25, TP=35, and so on. And about pyramiding… This can be done when certain market conditions are meet. Doing some backtesting, I’ve noticed that most of the time it’s better to take a single trade than to add new lots to an existing position. But, that doesn’t mean that sometimes good trends don’t give this opportunity of pyramiding. In this case, I think in order to minimize the risks, any new number of lots or minilots added must be lower than the original position. Example: if we open 0.5 lots we can add 0.2 lots, then 0.3 lots, then 0.4, and so on. So the risk in the case that market goes against us is minimized and in the same time our position is grown gradually. I’m waiting your suggestions and ideas.

I consider myself simple minded and because of that I like to keep my trading simple. I'll outline my thoughts on how I prefer to trade this method. First of all, I think going with the trend is key but not always necessary. Discretion is needed to determine times of sideway action where trading this way can be a losing battle. Support/resistance is also something to consider. I don't believe in pre-set take profit or stop loss figures. IMO it limits the trade's potential by putting a 50 pip TP for example. I do not set any profit targets. I ride the wave until I get taken out. Sometimes it's a long ride, sometimes short. We all know the way to enter (enter on break of peak when long and vice versa for short). Then set the stop loss below the previous valley (when long). As price moves up (hopefully), you move your stop loss below each valley that is formed. To pyramid (which I think is another important component), open new long positions everytime a new peak is broken upwards. And move the stop loss of the new position below each valley accordingly. That's pretty much it. Using a 1sma on average price seems to do the trick for me. I'm not saying this is the right way to do it. There is no right or wrong way. Whatever works for each person. As long as money is made. Tom

100% right , if pyramiding you should lock profits of the last position (or BE) before thinking of adding another one. The problem i encountered in pyramiding is that all the time (except when market is really trending), you won't be able to put more that 2 or 3 trades and almost all the time the last one is a loss. That's why i trade with a single loss. I only choose the trades with a low SL value. Buy at picks and sell at valley (although sometimes i manage to enter before the break) I put my stop loss at the opposite pick/valley. I only put my trades if I know that I have nothing to do in the next 2 or 3 hours. It's the time that takes me to manage my SL. Once I'm in good profits (and that depends on the pair I'm trading and the rally this pair made this day comparing to it's volatility) I set my SL at the previous bars high/low. It's like a a trailing stop. If i see a long bar in my favor I close the trade because most of the time a correction will be made. I always put a sheet of paper on my desk, write on it the trades I'm in, I put next to each trade the value of my stop loss, every time I change a stop, i make a new column to check the progress of my trades. Because I never look at the floating P/L . I come in mind that today I allow myself to loose let's say 200 pips and keep the progress of my maximum drawdown. It should be something like this : -200 -170 (oh good! I've won 30 pips... In fact I didn't LOL) - 150 -100 ....... until I'm in positive If all my SL are hit If I put 5 trades, and only 1 trade went in good profits, 2 of them hit their initial SL (which from the beginning are too small) and the others where small profits or small losses. I have a winning day In the end everyone have his own type of trading that fits him!! I'm only sharing with you the way I do it and hoping to give you more ideas. happy pipping!!!

Hi people, I wanted to ask two questions - 1. Do you use the P &amp; V system at it basic or do you follow the 1-2-3-4 rule as well? 2. Do you use any trend or momentum indicator ? I ask this questions because my performance is getting worse every day, and I'm a little lost. BR Dani_M

--- 帖子 #413 ---
1-I use the 123 formation described by joe ross 2-I also use ATR to check for current price volatility. It helps a lot to know when to close position

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hello Dani, I see you have some problems and I would like to give you a little hand. I must say to you that I am closely to finish backtesting the P&amp;V on the E/U on 2007. So, based on this, I’ve managed to pull out some conclusions and ideas that I hope you will find them useful. About SL and TP on this pair, SL is maximum 50 pips on 4H TF. And regarding further management of the trades, I posted my previous post my ideas. P&amp;V is a profitable strategy as it is, with no indicators. Also, on 4H TF, parities like G/J and G/C requires very large SL and that’s why I believe that these pairs must be managed on lower TF in order to achieve a reasonable SL. I’ll test this idea, too. In order to achieve better results, maybe you should watch fewer parities, because there are periods when you need to take a good care of your transactions, and not letting the green pips turn into red. Having to watch too many parities might distract you. Even f I reduced the number of my charts. Just think about it. That’s about all for now. Btw, today was a very good day for P&amp;V on the dollar parities. I’m expecting good news from you. Don’t give up!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Dan_Mir, I used a trend indicator to determine the trend. I know this is suppose to be naked, but the indicator makes it easier to study the chart. I also look at the daily chart and to enter my order from the 4H time frame following the overall trend from the dailies. I am also quite new to this concept but at times, you might just get out of luck. I was in EURUSD and GBPUSD yesterday, it hits my SL at 50 and now it rockets up.. Hang in there buddy. All will be good. Don't give up.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
hey guys... any response to this.. ??

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi GYFU, I prefer to buy above the high/low... sometimes I try to enter before the breakout. Take a look at this trade I made on EUR/CHF We have some kind of a strong resistance at A At F We had a break of the Valley but at that time i was sleeping so i missed that entry Now if don't want to take into consideration the whipsaw in B, E have formed around 50% of retracement. So I place my entry at the low of bar E with SL at it's high+spread. What I did is that I entered the market at around 7 pips before the breakout!! And I entered with a lower SL of 20 pips. Same thing can be done at F Happy pipping!!!!

--- 帖子 #418 ---
A strong support is showing on CHF/JPY Will exit this trade as soon as i'm at BE or small loss

Hello everyone, I've just found this thread a couple of days ago, and just finished reading it from scratch. As it was already said many and not enough times, thanks a lot to Kevin for starting it and for his contributions, and to all those who have given their time, especially Swingtrader65 and Freevey. I started trading demo today, and so far 2 winners out of 3 (the loser wasn't supposed to be taken as per the rules, btw). One question that was already asked but not answered: Is there some reason to use the median to draw the 1SMA instead of the close, or the high/low for that matter? As Freevey said, it is a matter of personal taste, but if we are looking for a breakout of the range, shouldn't it be "appropriate" to use the high/low of the peak/valley bar? Well, just stopping by. Will post any future results, for anyone interested. Pips to you all Middleastern

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hey gyfu, I think there is no response yet because could it be that folks are experimenting with the choices? I am. Going back to the drawing board so to speak. Have been looking at just using a simple line of closing price, not candles or bars. Also have a S/R indicator. I use VT trader, but MT4 has this as well. Oh, looking at daily right now. May look at 4 hr.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi Lou, I do agree that perhaps most are still looking at it and so forth. I just wanted to know at least that someone is looking at it and the topic did not just get dropped. It doesn't seem to be a clear answer but it looks like a double edge sword. If use the close or median instead of the peaks, you might get lucky and earn extra pips. But then again, there will be times, when it will stop you out, cos you enter earlier. I hate to say it, but looks like to each is own. Unless someone really took the effort to measure up the entries.. and compare the numbers. Cheers

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hello all, My second day of part-time trading demo with this approach. Stopped out twice (USD/JPY &amp; AUD/USD) for a total of -40 pips, and right now I am riding a nice wave on GBP/CHF, with 90 pips up and looking good. I am working on 1H charts, looking at the 4H and Daily to see the higher trend. I think that the depth/height of the valley/peak has a lot to do with the winning probability of each particular trade. Did someone thought about that? From my little observation time, it seems to me that the bigger the difference between the peak/valley and the buy/sell stop order price, the bigger the chance of getting into a winning trade. I am using a SL on the previous peak/valley, and the SMA1-close. Hope someone is enjoying the G/C rally too. I am getting into identifying the setting prior to the breakout. Thanks again Kevin and Swingtrader65. By the way, those of you trading with many pairs, get a good reading of the Word file Swingtrader65 published here, if you didn't do it already, and his/her posts. Experience is everything, they say, so nothing better than enjoying what ST65 has plenty of. Be well Middleastern

Thanks, You gave me an idea... using fibs to highlight the troughs (in an upmove) to quantify them in order to see how deep is 'deep'.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hey Kevin, Good to hear from you. Especially when you bring presents. I noticed the long wicks. Like others still confused about the strength of these. At times I use the cursor to find a price common to most of the wicks and use that for a limit order placement.

Another thread that just dies off?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Finally .......... New Beginning

--- 帖子 #429 ---
A question for experienced traders please: In the chart below as an example; Price has broken through the previous peak where I've put my line. I'm using the sma1 for P&amp;V's, the candle has just formed.Would you take this trade or wait until the candle has close so that you have a definite peak? The reason I ask is it is coming up to resistance. Thanks, Bogus.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
If you look at the candle just before the current one you can see that before it closed it passed the sma peak but then closed below the peak. The current candle is also tentatively passing the peak but may close without passing. Waiting for a close seems best.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Nope... People are backtesting and forwardtesting

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks Thexder, I'll continue forward testing, backtesting seems to give an untrue picture .I don't like the idea of setting limit orders because of spikes. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
This is one I'm watching. Its made a trough on the upside of the 50 ema, if it makes a peak higher on candle close it would seem like a good signal.(hopefully)

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hey bogus, I think one thing worth pointing out on your first chart is how bearish the chart looks. If I were you, I'd stick mostly to shorts, until the chart has an appearance of being flat or bullish. The trend is your friend, Kevin

--- 帖子 #435 ---
OK. Fair call. Thanks Kevin.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
One other question regarding the 50 pip initial stop loss. Let us take an example of the long trade. If the trade goes in my favor, say 50 pips, then I have few options: 1. Close the trade and take profit 2. Bring the SL to BE 3. Leave the SL as it is until a new low is formed above the entry price and move it under new low. (which is what, I think is the description of Kevin's approach) My question is, what if the previous low point is below 50 pips, upon entry? Shouldn't the SL be widened to make it below the previous low? Technically if my stoploss is not below the previous low, it can hit the stop loss and turn around. right? Is it just a matter of preference or is there a more correct way of doing this. Thanks, TradeStar

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I think you would want to put your stop loss below some type of resistance that price has shown in the past.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Guys, I don't know how many would be interested in this. I've been trying to find a way to compounding lots. Also I've been trying to find rules that will minimize discretion in the trades because I trade with only one lot and I know how discretion is important. I also found that the bigger the TF the less we have Losses, so I tried the H4 I backtested about one year on EU (H4) These are the rules: 1-Wait for a 123 formation, that will be the way we can determine the start of a trend. Never take the first breakout (the breakout of the #2) 2- Once trend confirmed, enter on peak/valley breakout of the high/low. 3- Valid picks and valleys are the one that have about 10 to 12 bars or more (about 2 days) 4- Enter with 2 positions. 5- SL = previous peak/valley 6- Never take a trade with more than 200 pips SL 7- TP for the first lot is equal to initial SL 8- Once TP is hit move SL of the second position at breakeven Adding lots: 1- Never add lots before TP of the previous position is reached and SL of the this previous position is at BE 2-All of the above except #1 are rules for adding lots too. 123 formation: The 123 formation is a good tools to know if a trend is about to begin: I won't explain it since Joe Ross in the Law of Charts explain it in a very good way (just google "Law of charts" and you will have it for free) In 2 words, it's simply a reaction of taking profits between short and long term traders. Stop Loss: 1- If multiple lots are opened, SLs of all positions should follow the last trade's SL (whether it's an initial SL or a BE SL) Now attached is a template. Download it and put it on an EU chart H4. This way you will see how I did the backtest. Also I should say that there might be some mistakes I made so apologize for that but I've spent the whole night looking for some system that requires the minimum of discretion. So if you see something wrong or you want to ask any question please give it a screen shot and I'll change it. It made about 2500pips over the last 16 months which is around 150pips per month. Results are not too encouraging but it may be interesting if we have same results on more pairs, that's why I encourage anybody who is willing to do the same backtest on other pairs otherwise I'll have to do them all by my own. Anybody interested, please do it in a template way so we can discuss the trades. Need your comments!!!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Dump backtest.......... Do forward test..... thats best for you on other note how you guys deal with requote..... I have been trying to close one of my long from +90 and it requote to now I am left with +20 ...........

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I know backtest is useless, but I believe that to start forward testing you should have a minimum of proof that it's worthy

--- 帖子 #441 ---
you believe its useless yet you still do it so you can feel good about it ? . Just do forward test on smaller timeframe such as 1 minute or maybe 5 minute, you will get hundreds of trade on a single day !

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I don't know if we can compare H4 to small TF like 15min in this case because the advantage of higher TF is less noise. Anyway, I have nothing to loose. Will give it a try and post results here. Thanks for the advice

[quote=paradise103;1888375] Hi paradise103, You did a good job. I appreciate your effort. I have found that using the 1-2-3 method is the best for me, and I'm using the 4H time frame as well. I am running the 1-2-3 system on 12 pairs and it is done by setting orders for buy and sell in advance. I've noticed that the less I touch it, the best results i get ....., so I set a ~50 pips SL, and a 100 pips TP, 25 pips TS and let it run. I think it was freevy who posted an automatic trade management EA. I should test it and see if my profits are getting a little higher. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
in comparision 4H chart is just a noise in weekly / monthly chart...... people DO make huge amount of money even with 1 second chart.....never underestimate any timeframe, respect them and stay with one you prefer. you can forward test 4H if you like and take 1 or 2 good setup for allot of pips, Or you can forward test with 1m chart and take 20 or 30 Good setup for 10-20 pips....... Its all in the mind.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
[quote=dan_mir;1888626] Hi Dan_mir, Thanks for your encouragement. Just wanted to ask if you enter with 2 positions and compound positions? And once you got the EA share it with us Thanks in advance

Cash or Noise ? you decide

thanks for the pic I was just about to ask the question Are you reading my mind?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
This is an interesting conversation. I kept wondering the same way! But what I see as an advantage in a longer time horizon with a smaller leverage, is you allow it to play it out as long as possible and adding the lots on the way at every opportunity, which should yield a compounded result, as oppose to getting in and out on shorter time frame. Perhaps, mathematically it might add up to the same, however, taking more frequent trade also implies more risk of loosing trades. Does it make sense? TradeStar

--- 帖子 #449 ---
[quote=paradise103;1888694] Hi again, 1. Sorry for being misunderstood, I don't put 2 orders, just one, in the direction of the expected breakout. sometimes I do have two orders on the same chart, but one belongs to the previous peak and one for the previous valley. 2. If you look at the attachments list of the thread, you can find the one called Trade_Manager_Expert.mq4 . this is the EA that manages the trade. it gives you many options for profit taking at pre defined levels, as well as moving your SL as the trade advances. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
More trade = more risk more reward Its all up to individual taste, What I reall want to say is, You can use smaller timeframe to test the system out in a forwardtest. using smaller timeframe, you can see allot more of this Peak &amp; Valley tradig setup compare to 1H or 4H. On your live trading, just go with whatever timeframe you want.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi, In order to keep this thread alive, as this is my trading methodology, I will post my position for the day. I trade 4H charts, so it is based upon peak &amp; valleys and 1-2-3 on this time frame. Maybe you want to compare my positions with the one you have. Don't let this tread die. BR Dani M

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Thanks for keeping things moving on this thread. Since I am relegated most of the time to the daily, I have been looking at support and resistance rather than/in conjunction with Peaks and Valleys. Often this is the same thing at certain time frames. At this point I have nothing to say.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Do you wait for close above the peak or just the break. Many times just a break proves false and it often falls back. What is your experience. TradeStar

--- 帖子 #454 ---
If you read the statement, it shows not all trade were profitable. It doesnt matter how you go with it, Break/Pierced / waiting till the high of candle on the peak .......... all will result in some sort of retracement / reversal and eat your equity. the best way is to keep the losses small and aim for large profit...... Or use this on 1 second chart and aim 3-6 pip with an ECN Broker

--- 帖子 #455 ---
hi everyone, One question. Do you consider chart pattern as one of the way to trade? Or is it just 1-2-3 method?

My TP is usually 100 pips on the 4H charts. If I understand you right, I should lower the SL. Do you have any back tested data, or suggestions for fix SL (in pips) on 4H charts ?

No offence here but I see you talking alot but not really saying anything of value in your posts. The advice you give is stuff that is already a known ( let profits run cut loses short - Backtesting is not like forward testing and so on ). It seems you just pop in and out of several threads but dont really contribute to the actual trading process of that thread. Since peak and valley is your trading style, how about posting a chart or maybe an entry or two with some explanation to your trades. This would be more productive to the thread then just old saying that have been around for years. I have been trading for more then four years but only post if I have a question or feel that I can contribute in some way. The old saying goes "Talk is cheap, SHOW ME" Again, No offence meant here, AZ

Thanks Dani M.[/quote] Dani, I think a fixed sl for 50 pips or even a 100 pips is not the way to look at any trade, don't think in terms of pips. You have to know before you enter a trade, at what point if price goes against you, your analysis is wrong? Now that could actually be 70 or maybe even 100 pips away because there may not be any meaningful s/r levels. I think that is key, once you determine the direction of the flow of price, you should then see at what point does the price have to go against the flow for that flow to no longer be valid. Sort of like a breakout from a range, if price breaks out from a range, and you enter, typically your sl should be on the other end of the range. This will help you determining you sl and also force you to look for better entry points, and cut down your leverage if the sl levels are high, maintain your fixed loss amount regardless of how many pips the SL covers. I know its easier said than done, but thats why trading is more an art than science, the more you play around with it, the better you get at your craft. Hope this helps. Ron

Thank you for the compliment.... yes I talk allot...... The most important thing is, The thing that has been said for centuries.... Remember Noah ? . He has been saying the same old thing over and over.. Thats exactly what I am doing . you can Backtest a thousand years of data and feel its a great system yet when you need to take the trade live, when you see the setup is happening, you will see the differences. Cut losses small, well. I have 2 account I play with... 1= I let losses for 2 month run, - 350 trades 14losses all other winner ... just made 15% nett 2 I trade for my $$$, I cut the losses, I took the profit at better %% . I made much more then 15% ... Its true and usually people starting will ignore these 2 very important fact, we just need to remind &amp; assure, its the best thing to do for their own good. Will this chart Do, which I post several days ago and reside just next page ? I guess you missed it ...... : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=62141&amp;page=30 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=446 In case you cant find it here it is again http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1204816539 how easy it is to take the trade on those chart ? because its so easy to mark on the chart and what you see is only profit and $$$ . while taking the trade realtime is totally different matter, which can only be achieved by forward testing. you know what they say "Old is Gold" No offense taken, I just feel some Heat

Thank you Fix SL is a sure thing to be Hit.. Put the SL above the higher Resistance, for SHORTS or lower then the next support for Longs. It might be 20 pip away and maybe its 130 pip away. you cannot put a lower Fix SL. what you can do is Identify the places where your SL are being Hit and move it to higher places, Then what you can do is lower your PIP Value so you still dont risk more then what you normally would, On my 1second chart Setup with EUR/JPY . If it went 5 pip against me, its a lost trade.....I would expect that, I enter the trade, the way it were going and if I enter the wrong way, I would get out immediately . BUT on 4 H chart my SL usually 150 pip.... but they worth almost the same as 15 pip in the 1 second chart Ron has given a great example as well.

Hi friends, 1. There is a very few people contributing and helping to keep this thread alive. If no one cares so I will bla bla bla bla . . . . Please assist ! 2. I had a very intensive weekend, I used the time to extract data and details of the trades i did, and to run correlations with the results. (4H charts) - A) From my successful trades, I took a list of how many pips did the market go "against" me during the trade. Finally, I will have a list of the max number of pips I should use as SL for each pair. B) I know we are talking about naked trading, but I'm trying to find a supporting tool for the decision to enter a trade or let go. I looked at correlations with Daily &amp; 4H trends and found that it has a minor positive correlation with successful trades, but it doesn't filter bad trades. C) lately, I was playing around with Boxingislife trading strategy "Sexy Stochastic". you have the link attached . I run a correlation between P&amp;V trades with and without confirmation signals from the other method. I've found that the percentage of successful P&amp;V confirmed by SS was high, and, it was great to see that it filtered bad trades with a high success percentage as well. D) I tried it today with 1H charts and the results looks very promising. I'll add a chart and a link to the thread so you can take a look. BR Dani M.

An indicator / a filter or whatever Do work on certain time and fail miserably on another time.....

I do admit, this system is boring unless you use it on 1 second chart

A good Anti Peak &amp; Vally system would be... Sell @ latest peak &amp; buy @ latest Valley ( work superb on ranging periods )

Thanks Syafi for your inputs. BR Dani M

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Ok, I'm back testing this system for a while and these is my tweaks: 1. SL is given by previous formation (peak or valley), but no more than 50 pips, risking no more than 2.5% per trade for 50 pips. 2. For SL&lt;25 pips the TP would be 2xSL, for SL&gt;25, TP=70 %( 1.4xSL) and 30%TL, where TL is trailing stop equal with the TP. 3. Never let a green trade turn into a red one, so when price goes in your favor for SL+5 pips, move SL close to 0. 4. The orders are placed at about 8 pips above/beyond peak/valley using SMA1, median price, 4H. There other ones, but this 4 are the most important ones. I'm testing this strategy only on 4 pairs, E/U, G/U, U/J and USD/CAD, because I believe in the quality of the trades despite the quantity. A goal of a medium 200 pips per month per pair is easily achieved in this formation, meaning a profit of 50%.

Hey guys, Just stopping in. What about trading with the 3-hour (4-hour) 24-SMA (3-4 day trend) entering on retracements on the hourly chart? If you still want to be naked, just look at the last 3-4 days I've tried this with 50 pip T/P on EUR/USD and have won 13 out of 17 of the last 17 trades. Not sure how many wins and losses I've had total in the last month of testing, but my return has been 18% on my $100 test account over the last month. At one point the account was as high as 30% increased, but due to the risk I am using the value fluctuates. I believe these numbers could be much better had I not made a couple of mistakes here and there. The only time your account really goes down is in between trends when the trends are changing or consolidating(non-existent).

Or, another offer - daily candlesticks with entry 1h-pick&amp;vallies

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Does anyone have ZUP indicator?pls post here.thanks

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Can you please explain this more. Thanks

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Yes On 24 March EUR/USD has a hammer - on the next day we have good rally on 1h-chart. On 31 March again reverse candle and on 1 April - good passibility on the 1h-chart. Is it clear so?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Excellent. Thanks Also, if we can count on prev. day's candle pattern (let's say reverse candle), we can actually sell at rallies rather than waiting for the valley to be broken. May be you are saying the same thing.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Here is the example

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Today was NZD/USD

--- 帖子 #482 ---
eur/cad seems good for a sell................especially with H &amp; S too.

Is there a way of getting a line chart of average price in MT4? Thanks

--- 帖子 #484 ---
is this what you are looking for? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=91

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Great. Thanks. this would work. I can do a SMA of avg price and will get the desired line graph. Thanks

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Really nice to have discovered this great thread, Kevin! Very nice! Thanks again, Brent

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi all One quick question just to get this thru my head once and for all. we are using a 1 sma set to close. now the question do we enter on a break of the last peak or valley according to the 1 sma close price or is the high or low of the candle that forms the peak or valley of the 1 sma and then set our s/l to a high/low of the prev 1 sma peak or valley. very basic i know but i want to clear up how swingtrader65 and kharvell or any of the experienced guys do this. cheers and thanks in advance for any help

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Its 1 sma set to median price HL/2. I personally set my stops at the low of the candle, but I think others use the sma.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thanks Bogus, is the entry at the break of the hi/lo of the candle or the break of the sma peak or valley

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I use lower timeframes for entry to get in before the break of the high and pay attention around the high or low about to be broken. Its all about support and resistance. I don't like using the sma break as an entry, but thats just me. The best part of this system is adding to your positions. Its about using a confluence of things.i.e. pivots fibs, sup &amp; res, trendlines etc and making a decision. Hope this helps, Bogus

--- 帖子 #491 ---
thanks very much bogus, it does indeed happy trading

--- 帖子 #492 ---
HI KEVIN..how'r u..thanks for sharing us such a simplest system but profitable if we used it in the right way and time..i went throught ur pdf file and i understand it since it's simple and short but comprehensive. anyway,kevin,i'm a little confuse at putting (buy and sell)pending order in both direction 3 or 5 pips just above or bellow peaks and valley...practically,what if both buy and sell order has been trigered due to market volotility while we're profiting in one direction only... ur explanation is much appreciated.or anyone else could answer this for me??thank u

--- 帖子 #493 ---
With any strategy using pending orders this could occur... Probably the best thing is to remove pending orders when there could be a high volatiility market (NFP)

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Let me answer to this one. In such cases it's better to place the orders at a certain distance in pips. I'm forward testing this strategy, for a while by now and one of my rules is to place the pending orders at a minimum distance of 50 pips, and also I've increased to about 10 pips (sometimes 11, or 12) above/bellow the most recent peak/valley. In this way you are somehow protected by the ranging markets, and spikes. Also, before news I move the pending orders to about 20 pips above/bellow the most recent peak/valley. For the open orders, before the news, if they are in profit (above or equal 15 pips), I move the SL to BE and increase the TP. If you have other questions, feel free to ask them, because I've spent the last months optimizing this method and I think I've done a good job.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Cornelius, 1. Would you mind sharing your best practice for this method ? 2. Did you consider placing 2 PO around peak/valley points ? placing buy &amp; sell for every P&amp;V point will allow us to win even when the market retraces from its previous high / low. Thanks, Dani M

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hello, Dan! Please be more specific about your questions. My entry strategy, is the one I wrote it above. About SL's and TP's I wrote them about in another post in this thread. Please take a look backward. Best regards!

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Hi, is this quote correct ? place the pending orders at a minimum distance of 50 pips, and also I've increased to about 10 pips (sometimes 11, or 12) above/bellow the most recent peak/valley

--- 帖子 #498 ---
The distance between a buy stop order and a sell stop order, it's better to be 50 pips. Sometimes it works, sometime it doesn't. But, in this way the orders have some room to breath and they do not overlap.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Anyone trading this system anymore?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
This system is traded by the pros, who rarely answers questions, it too easy and it works..

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Are YOU such a pro trader!?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I answer your question didn't I ? so i am not such pro trader with this system, ... but really, its easy........ just take the trade when it break previous support/resistance, with SL below or higher previous Support Resistance at market active time..

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hey all, I know I'm late to the game here, but I like this thread. I've most recently been trading Bill Williams Chaos, which is a great trend following system that advocates pyramiding your positions, but I think it is often unecessarily complex. This looks much simpler and should probably produce similar results. I believe that adding into your winning positions is the way to go. A question if anybody is still following this and trading it. Was it ever clearly decided what the best entry is for this? By that I mean, should the entry be made on the break of the (average price) line chart's peak/valley, or should it be on the fractal high/low of a candle/bar? I'll probably go back and read the thread again, but I'm just looking for opinions on this. Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hello, I rather like this strategy myself, though for some reason I have been following other things. According to Syafi, this is a strategy that the pros use, of a sort. Anyway, the PDF explains entries and exits pretty well. This is a simple system that really seems logical. I use the Melpheos for defining the peaks and valleys. The PDF and Melpheos are in the paperclip collection up top. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #505 ---
There is no right way,...... pick one and goes with it...... try in on 15m chart using micro lot for a week or two, then if you dont like it change to other entry exit such as break body? or break line etc.. take what work for you then move on to higher timeframe, 4h is best to catch really big move, you would be up ~1800 pip on GU by now an example using a 4H line chart

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Thanks to you both for the help. I think I'll go with the line charts; it looks cleaner and easier to see the peaks and valleys. I've always used candles so it'll take a little getting used to reading it correctly. I'll be trading 4H and daily charts, so I'll have to figure out stops differently. I think I'll start with the last P/V previous to the entry, and if thats' too far away maybe I'll use ATR, say 1.5 x the 10 period average. I just want it to be simple. The best traders I know of that last the longest don't complicate things too much..... Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #507 ---
ATR ?? that's too many indicator on the chart.......

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Don't worry, I figure out the daily ranges myself, no indicators....

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Can me somebody tell what is the best Timeframe and currency pairs in usin this system? Do you use Fibo for exits? Do you use some indicators and TA or just trading whats you see on the line chart? Thank you, Greetings,

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Another one bites the dust

--- 帖子 #511 ---
No wonder the 95%. .

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Rac told me about the line chart 2-3 months ago and i started testing it. I am having very good results in trending conditions of last 3 months (on demo). Well in these last 2 months i started to see many patterns jumping out at me. For example the "reversal pattern" and i thought i made a new discovery. lol So now i have found this great thread (and some brilliant PDF's) i will try to post some charts/thoughts/idea's in future. ..

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I agree, this was a great thread. I've re read a lot of posts many times. Swingtrade65's helped a lot. I don't trade the same way but It made me think and work out my own way.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Ok here is the First one. .

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Lets wait and see if this 4H close like this. .

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Have you entered long at the dark blue line or are you waiting for a 4 hour close?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I am waiting for the Close. So we could get a nice BUOB also. .

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Cool. A bit of resistance above.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Well spotted Bogus, But it's already tested. So this time odd's of breaking it are much higher. .

--- 帖子 #520 ---
hi guys..according to the method..i can buy this ej from the top, as per attached?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
If we take a look at 1H, Price already gave a close above 122.53. Now i would like to see a break of 122.60. .

--- 帖子 #522 ---
then u would only long this till the next blue line above? just want to know how you take this trade..dont worry..not making any trades..just learning.. thanks

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Well the first thought was that if 4H would have closed above 122.50 but it did't. Now i will enter at the break of Blue line (latest Peak). P.s It's all pretty simple Just go through the thread and read PDF's.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Here's another one. I would like to see 1h close above 136. .

--- 帖子 #525 ---
UC has just Triggered. The signals on EJ and GJ are half signals so i am a little careful on these ones. .

--- 帖子 #526 ---
So here we are. Now Let continue with the trend. .

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Shorting EJ plus 21.5 at the moment. Exited 45pips in the green... First try and very happy!

--- 帖子 #528 ---
And the last ones for today. .

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Thanks nas for your posts, and bumping this thread. Find this method very interesting and appealing. Just curious, how are you managing these trades? I assume you look for near by PPZ for exits, but when do you move to cost? Do you use anything fancy to determine trend, or just purely eyeball? Do you play most peaks/valleys, when the trend is strong, or only the bigger ones? Sorry, very general questions, just looking for some kind of insights. Thanks and take care.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thanks J, for dropping in. Well i knew i had to say this so here goes, The questions you asked are not general or simple ones, they are to hard for someone inexperienced like me to answer. I have just started to see some light in the last 2-3 months so i can't just tell anybody to do 1-2-3 and get done. But i assure you that i will share my thought's/views on these thing as i progress. What's written below are only my views so you can differ. The Line chart alone will not make you money. (yes i am saying this). Line chart is not a method/system itself, It's just an indicator/trigger, like PIN BARS, INSIDE BARS, OUTSIDE BARS etc. If you don't believe me that's fine but you better believe Martin Pring. I spent 2 hours on his 5 page PDF. To get any kind of success at this. You must know where your WEEKLY/Daily---S/R (PPZ's) and Big round numbers are located. There is no second choice. Take 10-20-30 pips (depending on pair), close half (33%,25% or whatever you like) your position and set your stops at BE's (at cost). It may sound foolish/greedy to you and i know 9 out of 10 times price will come back and take you out at 0 (BE). But this 1 time will take you for a long ride. . Btw how many pips you could have made on the trades i posted today by doing this????? You do the math. You are going to have around 2-5 trades on 10-20 pairs on every normal trading day. So don't go below 1H before mastering the H4 and daily. At least you won't see a chart from me, of anything below 1H. That's all for now. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Thanks a lot man, very helpful. Do you think these are good trades here? Sorry if you posted these earlier, forgot what you had posted, but went through my charts trying to see what seemed appealing to me. Here are some CT ones, but with strong PA, and nice triggers near by. Targets and exits aside, do you think these are good plays here?

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hey J, Your entry is good but did you moved stops. I mean how did you managed them? .

--- 帖子 #533 ---
What I did find interesting is how clear this shows a head and shoulders at the W pivot, that was nowhere near as clear on a candle chart.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
These are our PPZ's. See how they flip the price over and over again. I learned them from J16. .

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Some more. .

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Last ones for today. .

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I didn't manage them, just punched in the entries wanted to make sure I at least understood that part I like this method, its interesting. When trading CT, it seems like just PA trading, but perhaps using better entries. When trend trading, its a bit different as your trading from swing lows. Would you say you have a preference between CT, and trend trading? Are you less picky with the trend ones? What kind of stops are you using? Thanks a lot for the help really appreciate it.....

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Here's Fiber 1H, with reversal pattern. It's a CT and very risky. Strong Resistance above. But i like when a setup meats opening of a session. .

--- 帖子 #539 ---
There's nothing better then trading a trend . But quality of the setup depends upon location of S/R and space. Well the major trend is down but currently we are in a ranging condition. Stops most of the times are at recent Peaks/Valleys but not on close, i use high low.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
ooops. Back with the trend now. ,

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Some yen trades. (Did't took AJ.) .

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Here's the ones I took last night. I guess the trend thing is maybe a little bit too much a part of my game plan? I don't know.... lemme know please if I am doing anything wrong on my entries. Still have 0 plan for exits and SLs, though I am leaning greatly towards a small profit and B/E, as consistancy is definitely the way I'd like to trade. When you mention S/R, is the main importance of it basically to a. measure the potential of the trade, and b. to, most importantly, not trade into it?

Hey, guys, just recently read through this entire thread and can see it goes back a ways; shame I only just now discovered it while googling around for topics on naked trading. Nevertheless, I am intrigued by the strategy and am hoping to start practice trading it tomorrow morning on my micro account. I did have a question that goes back to something the original poster (Kevin) answered some time ago: He mentioned pairs often change their nature on a year-to-year basis and I guess I'm wondering if most of you still use these pairs for the reasons Kevin mentioned? Do you still feel it's best to stick with charting no more than six pairs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hi Tailgun, I mainly trade E/Y. I've taken a few trades lately on Cable for the reason you mentioned- things could change with the way a pair moves, and I want to be familiar with other pairs for more options. I just love the way E/Y moves; nice and flowing. There's not much need too look at too many. They all move differently. I only watch 6. Good luck

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Here i am..... .

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Been reading this thread - very nice Nasir - it's a very effective way of playing a strong trend with good %R...notice the inverted H&amp;S on the EJ 125.00 being the neckline...

--- 帖子 #552 ---
.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks for pointing out. i always miss inverted H&amp;S. . A little problem with me. I think this time i'll be taken out. Lets see.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Nasir - what was the reason for your first buy order on GBP / JPY?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Touch Trade. and you know how it was done don't you. .

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I think so...not quite getting it all at the moment with regards the touch trades and Rac approach. Are you still holding your positions from this thread...did you add new position on nreak of new peak in GU?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Nop i missed the GU but see if it comes back. .

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I have a question: Since the strength of this strategy is pyramiding trends, should we only trade when a strong weekly trend appears to be underway? What if the weekly (or daily) chart shows a strong trend, but the 4-hour does not? And what if the 4-hour chart shows a strong bullish trend, but the weekly chart shows an overall bearish trend?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
aha! u are quiet 'there', but not so here. Kevin's thread is awesome.. good choice.

--- 帖子 #560 ---

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi nasir...doing nicely on these trades. Just a quick question, why are you looking to go long Euro...I would have thouyght ou would be looking to short a break of the lower valley?

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hello Mark, look at his chart. i think he wants to go long (as break) above the 1.3434 ppz &amp; lower peak. Hope this helps btw, for those new to the term, PPZ means price pivot zone. learn more about it in the james16 thread

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Yeah saw that, but just thought at the time that the obvious pending order would be a sell below the valley as we have had LH and LL's...I also see something else as well to convince to go long that I missed before (Rac setup)

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Bonjour nasir.khan, Regarding the EURUSD trade, the last lower high retested the PPZ, it means that odds for breaking now are much higher, but in accordance with Martin Pring's pdf, this breakout would be JUST a half signal because there was a lower low before ! Is that an agressive trade and is your entry based on the break line chart high or at the current break bar high ? Same question for the stop loss level ? Thanks Happy trading, Angel

--- 帖子 #565 ---
i think in this case, a pending sell order would be canceled (trader discretion).

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I was short from the 4H pin. I also added more on this break but when i saw the FIB and strong support @ 3384 (plus a bounce on it), i closed them both and placed my buy stop. . P.S Ignore the buy on 3420. .

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Nice to see you 'here' SC. I also told them about PPZ. . off to lunch. .

--- 帖子 #568 ---
nasir.khan, ah, yes, I remember. see u later , with eur$ @ +/-1.3450 hopefully Kevin (thread starter) drops by from time to time.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Thanks, for some reason I didnt have this PPZ 'visualised' on the lower time frames...saw it and the fib retracement etc. after my post.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I am glad you took time to read his PDF. Yes it is a half signal. But what makes this trade better is 4h FIBs and Weekly PPZ. (see the charts i posted in reply to Lovejoy). .

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Nasir.khan, Yes, I have even printed it to read and re-read it !! Please, could you concider my question regarding your entry/stop loss levels ? I mean is your entry/stop loss based on breaks of line chart high/low or breaks of current bar high/low ? Thanks for your attention, Happytrading all Cheers

--- 帖子 #572 ---
kevin, your idealogy is really quite impressive, but i find it difficult to trace the valleys and peak on the running market, like i am watching currently over the EURUSD chart for H4, and ongoing, i placed some valleys and peaks, now m stuck at a point where i am not able to make a valley..... please enlighten this point for me thanx...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
This is where S/R comes into play. Keep on trading with the trend in 1H-4H. Keep on marking the strong S/R levels on daily/weekly/monthly. When you price reach this strong S/R level wait and see if market break's it or bounce from it but keep an eye on higher time frames for a signal also, that's how you could avoid the usual choppy markets at an end/delay of a trend. I think i simplified it too much. Anyways you need to do it to see it. .

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Most of the time High/Lows. .

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Nasir.khan, I would presume that you use HIGHS/LOWS because of the price spike. I love very much this way of trading waves because of the pyramiding concept at breakout, no need to chase extreme market levels by buying at swing low or selling at swing high for making money in the long run ! Check this also : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=219561 It's all about orders flow and S/R Happy trading

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Well i can't enter at line chart break, gnoring High/Lows after watching this video. . The last time i visited that thread people were fighting over the Order Flow and PA. not my thing. .

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Closed and reversed EU cause it broke back the Valley and 1.35. .

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hmmm i think i am up around 3,000 pips in just 7-8 days and most of them were posted live. If you could get moves like these once in a month or 2 or even 3 you could do well. .

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Nice one Nasir...it's a great way to trade a trend isn't it and very simple. Thanks for the PM too.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Ok guys i won't be posting much in next some days. Good Luck. .

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Where do you guys put your stops at for this method? Heres an idea I had, nothing crazy, but I think I will try it out for awhile. Here we have a breakout, and I put my stop behind the nearest PPZ beyond the breakout. I use the ATR, its not a magic number, just something to keep some consistancy. At 1 ATR profit I pull 33 percent, I cut my stop to 1/4th, which puts me at BE, or slight profit, and keeps my stop hidden behind place I played breakout from. Then, how to trail other main position? I am split between hard targets and trailing behind other peak's, and valleys. Trailing behind other peaks and valleys would be more consistant, but how many of these big moves can I really catch playing that conservative. Attached Image (click to enlarge) First line is minor PPZ prior to breakout. Second line is where my stop would be.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
The very first thing to consider while managing my trades that I never use arbitrary numbers like 15, 20 or ATR. I always look for near S/R to move stops or taking profits. Well this a very difficult question to answer cause every trade has a different outcome I mean you could be certain about a trade/price to some extent that it will travel from point X to point Z but you could never know how it will go there. Will it shoot up in a minute and touch Z? Will it take some time making further peaks and valleys? Will it just show you a profit straight away after you enter the trade or will it hang near you entry price or maybe go below it and show you a drawdown for several days before continuing in your direction again? So it is like a TRUE/FALSE question exam and you have no idea what the answers are. What you can do in this situation is to tick either all the FALSE boxes or TRUE boxes. So you could get 50%-70% of them right. So this is how exactly you could manage your trades. If you take quick profits of 20-40 pips and set your SL at BE you will surely have a high win rate BUT you may not catch big runners for weeks or even months. If you wait for price to either hit your SL or hit the next S/R level before taking partial profits and moving your SL you won't have a high win rate but you would catch 200-500 pip moves more often. So whatever style you want to pick for your trade management stick to it for 3-6 months and see if it suites your personality and your tradiing method. With experience and solid believe in your skills/methods you can start to treat different trades/scenarios with different trade management approach's that will help you successfully execute your different market situations more often. LIKE KNOWING THE CORRECT ANSWER TO EVERY QUESTION. In the end all I could say is that a stranger on internet cannot tell you that what will work for you. TO KNOW THE GAME YOU NEED TO PLAY THE GAME.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hmm, yeah, you are very right. Thanks for the well thought out answer. The ATR thing, its just so I can keep similar stops. I would not want a 30 pip stop for g/j, and the same stop for u/j, I mean its not a big deal of course. Starting next week I'm going to set up 2 seperate demo accounts, and try to put in a solid month of testing for both. I think that is a fair way to asses this method, considering how many trades it produces, 1 month would be a huge sample of trades already. Guess I'll have to see. 1 last question I had. Say a peak/valley rides up against a PPZ, would you play the break of the peak/valley, which is also a PPZ break? Thanks again for all the help

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Check the charts i posted in this thread and you'll get your answer. . .

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Can you post a chart showing your problem. .

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Is everyone trading this strategy off the 4H charts? I'm wondering if anyone is having luck trading off the 1H. I keep finding for most of the pairs (most of the time) that a 50 pip SL is insufficient for this strategy on the 4H chart -- that it often doesn't cover the length of even a single candle. And going for an even larger stop would leave me with a positively microscopic lot size...

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Like i said, I am never comfortable using random numbers like 20-50-100. I use S/R for my SL's specially. Sometimes it's 20 pips sometimes its 100 pips. But every body have their own choice. .

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Some current trades...

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I'm also in UC (thanks to Nasir!!) and UJ...

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hope you got out of UC okay! That move was very frustrating - sometimes you do get some quick moves with CAD. UJ didnt go as far as I wanted it to but a stop and reverse was valid - havent quite mastered it yet like Nasir. GBP / CHf going well. Just taken this gold breakout...did anyone get the whole trend and add in positions on each breakout?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Unfortunately took a full loss on UC...Im'in gold...but entered just yesterday on the retracement, not on the breakout...my stop is at BE... I always have dounbt with this method on when move my stop to BE...even on UC i could have moved my stop...

I got out of gold earlier when it started to retrace and back in again when it hit previous support and back out again @ 1163.40...a PPZ around this area... Looking for reversals now on EU,AU and GU

Hi,lovejoy80 I am impressed by your trades, it seems all of yours except the last one are counter trend. what were the reasons for you to enter those CT trades, if I may ask?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
There is no particular reason for my trades being CT...it's just going with the current 'trend' on that timeline...the break of HH and HL's indicated a trend change (talkng about a short entry) and then it's a case of playing each break of a HL until there is an obvious trend reversal point again...pickingthe start of the 'trend' is the hardest part...after that adding in further positions is straightforward and each time moving you SL's up etc... Of course the market doesn't always trend...in fact it has been trending rather well lately.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hi, lovejoy80 please refer to below charts of your trades. for the first short entries of the two charts at least, I didn't see a LH and LL as a sign showing a downtrend has been established on the H4 TF. could you please provide more details of your thinking process for these trades? thank you as always. jeurre

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I think maybe LL and LH terminology was misleading...what I mean was the reason for the trade entries was a break of the previous support areas on the time frame in question which indicates a trend change...if you are still not clear let me know and I'll annotate the charts you posted.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
here are my current AJ trades...I've shown the line chart...is the reasoning behind the trades clear now?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi, lovejoy80 It is much clear with the charts. did you change your stoploss in between? I guess your entry was triggered upon the break of the head and shoulder, correct me if I am wrong. jeurre

--- 帖子 #605 ---
The chart I showed are current AJ trades...they look similiar to the previous ones (which were last week) as the location is about the same...the method for both sets of trades was the same...break of of support / valleys...was looking for shorts as AJ price is @ a TL resistance.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Thank you, lovejoy80 !

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi Lovejoy...I'm in the same Aj trade...it was going well...but i don't like so much the up move of last hour...let's see..

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Mine hit my profit target overnight @ 86.03...confluenc eof TL. fib and PPZ. Uj, EJ and GJ looked good for potential shorts though after the move we just had...

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I think we are steering away from the basic that this thread was started upon and i am first one who started it. The main method is to take trades upon the break of Peak or Valley. But my trading (also LJ and now Chris also) involves lot of other things (TL's, Fibs, PA) that brings discretion in our trades. So new people get a little confused when they read first couple of pages and see what's happening in last pages. IMHO.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Yeah agreed will stick to posting trades that are in acordance with this thread method

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Ok!! Even if my AUDJPY trade was opened (too late) as per this thread rules...after a valley break. Anyway I colsed AJ in profit on the retracement of that big 1H green bar...

Tks Nasir , for the charts . R u entering these trades totally on touch or are you also using pa . Really enjoy all your posts an tks for sharing . Gary

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi Nasir, I see you using this strategy now for some time i wanna try it also because it is great for me i dont like all the noise. Before i traded 15 min charts with indys etc But i need 1 larger timeframes i like the simplicity and it is based on pure pa. But i have 1 question what ratio you will give it winning ratio? Thanks for answer already

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I trade touches, Breakouts retraces and PA altogether. If you'r asking about above trades they only based on breaks of Valleys but if you have PA on your back it's a nice confidence booster. .

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I am not sure what you'r exactly asking here. If your asking about Win/Loss ratio well i have don't have good idea how much is it? I don't pay attention to Ratios and RR's and % gains.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I mean the gains lets say 10 trades 8 winners 2 losers is 80% winning ratio.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I think somewhere near 70%-80%. Cause markets are trending hard so it will come down as they will start to range again. .

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Thanks for the reply , my assumption was correct . i ve been studying j 16 for awhile an stumbled on peak an valleys , ive been testing it for a week . Reading your post have helped alot . Hope to contribute also . Cheers, Gary

--- 帖子 #620 ---
A peaks &amp; valleys trade I'm in...AUDJPY..let's see..

--- 帖子 #621 ---
hello all, i'm quite confused about this technique. First of all, you place PO (if at the peak) +5pips from the pip in buy position? and the other way around for valley? is it?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Too bad...I've been stopped out from this trade before the big down move...

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I took the time to read this thread over the weekend. I put this to work last night and today. I am up over 150 pips for the day. This is so simple and works like a charm. Thank you for providing clarity and simplicity in trading.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
E, which TF are you using and which pair(s)?

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I used the 1 hr and the pairs were the eurusd, eurjpy and gbpjpy. Put two on last night before I went to sleep and had 3 others this morning.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Sweet. Good job! Have you been using the 50-pip stop recommended at the beginning? I'm still wondering if that is sufficient for the hourly TFs; I know when I looked at it before it seemed inadequate for the 4H.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I have been using the 50 pip stop. However, I am also looking at the 50 and 200 sma's and pivots. If I need to go below or above, then I set it more.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
so basically we use peaks and valleys as breakouts not as reversal as i always thought thnks for the great system , will post my trades and results here

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi all, Thanks for this great thread. It really open up my mind but i still have some question on how i should trade based on peak and trophs method. Attached with the GU H4 and my question is: 1. Should i short on P1, P2 and P4? 2. Should i long on P3? Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
SOmeone could help me??? Peaks &amp; Valleys are made by Close line of 4H bar or Median Price 4h bar ???? Tnx

--- 帖子 #632 ---
doesn't matter, in fact i suggest u just use a regular OHLC or candle chart. Take the obvious ones, its really that simple.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
But if i use OHLC Bar peaks&amp;valleys are made by LOW &amp; HIGH....and there is a big distance by close in terms of pips....... I don't understand.....

--- 帖子 #634 ---
You are referring to those tails ? Those are big information my friend. Although in it's purest form, you can use average prices or close prices, my approach is that observing those tails on the chart can give you a better feel of the action. Use both, try pulling out a bar chart and plot a 2 period SMA, you get best of both worlds.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
OK i will try! Tnx for your point of view!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
A blind monkey could have used this system to make a killing this week. What a market.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
This is just peaks and valleys on 15 minute e/y over the last 24 hours. Ive used a 12 ema, but that's pretty irrelevant.Count the pips. Stops can either be behind prvious p/v or a set number of pips.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I thought I would post some charts of the way I trade and I thought this thread would be as good a place as any. I mainly trade EJ and enter off a 15 minute chart. I use a 35 pip stop and 2% of my a/c on this pair. I figure if it retraces more than that, then it wasn't such a great trade to start with anyway. I enter on a 1-2-3 break. I enter 3 pips past point 2 to try and stop the false moves which sometimes happen as price will move 1 pip beyond then retrace. No set amount of pips is perfect but I am comfortable with 3 . I first start off by looking at the higher timeframe sup/res and either go in the direction of the 4 hour highs and lows,(by this I don't mean candle patterns as there can be a different looking candle depending on when you broker starts his 4 hour cycle,I mean what looks like a high and low to ME, i.e. discretionary) and drop down to the 15 minute chart and enter on that, OR, enter on a 15 minute chart at major sup/res,i.e G/U at 1.50 or E/U at 50% fibo. I set 1/2 of my position with a TP of 100 pips and trail both 1/2's up behind the peaks and valleys.I don't move my stop until another valley has formed. That means, say I'm long, that another 1-2-3 has occurred and point 2 is taken out.This allows me to catch a good move plus take profit. Ill post some charts.The lines and arrows are my entries and the "X"s are my trailing stops.

This is one Im in now and last nights one.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
This is what I call a bunny trade. I entered on the 5 minute chart at the bottom on a break higher and exited at the yellow line because.....I'm not too sure why, and it carried on without me.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
This is one from May. I entered because price was making peaks and troughs higher so I entered the first trade. The second I took because of a p/v lower at resistance.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Beautiful trade at London open.I entered early because of the stunning pin bar.

Bogus How did that last posts trade turn out? What was the reasons behind entry? Golferguy99

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hey GG, That was one I took because of the way price action was around Asia open. I took 35 pips on the first 1/2 and B.E +1 on the second. Because I watch the 1 minute chart and enter on that it was just a scalp.I was also aware of the trend-line. Cheers

--- 帖子 #652 ---
does anybody still use this system in trading? Do you enter in trade with stop orders or with market orders?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
May I say its a a shame this thread stopped,in my honest opinion (IMHO hehe),its the only way to trade,,,,,no stress, no noise,no hassle.....nuf said

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I'd be keen to post the odd chart. Peaks and troughs is probably as close as you'll get to idiot proof. No guessing which fib or support line it's going to bounce off. I see support/resistance as a ladder that price walks up and down. Self control is the key. Less is more.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
All for it Bogus.....lets get this thread back on it's feet

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi,nice chart. Kindly post your template and indicator.thanks..... Ayour2a

Bogus,ayour2a,adianto,are any of you taking this one?4hr oz (Pending)

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Morning. Just woke up . Yep that's the next swing. I closed my trades out just before the tide change at L.Open. Being the time of the week I don't have any trades or pending orders. Looking forward to next week. I'll be looking for an hourly 123 for an early entry. Do you trade the yen pairs Tedge?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Ayour2a, I'm the same as Tedge. Don't know how too post templates etc. The chart just has a 24 and 8 ema. Nothing special about the numbers, just use them for a visual. Cheers, Bogus

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hi Bogus,yes I do trade the yen pairs,after all a chart is a chart and a break is a break,seems we trade very similar,I also like the 123 patterns although I don't trade anything less than the 4hr charts,(just my preference).Have a good weekend guys,lets keep this great way of trading going.Tedge

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I thought I'd post some charts. I've changed the way I trade a bit. I trade less, and pretty much always, have to have price on the right side of the 12,34,and 96 emas on the 15 minute chart. I let them run alot more. The first few are different views of the same trade on eu.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Look at those beautiful peaks and troughs.

You are probably getting up as I type this,nice charts,can you post that indi you have at the bottom of your screen,seems that would be a good one to see p&amp;t in different t/f's Thanks again Bogus,Tedge

--- 帖子 #671 ---
The indicator is Hanover's "recent candles" in the platform tech forum. I don't know how to post it sorry. Currently short AU,NU and AY after the FOMC announcement.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Looking good on those trades Bogus,I am still short AU altho retracing a bit at mo

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hi Tedge, I'm flat at the moment. I got out at .7488 on n$ and .9910 on a$. I've got a pending short on a$ at .9907. N$ is setting up long now, but time of the day is making me pass on that. I might miss out but am happy to leave it.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hi Bogus,yh I have a pending order in too but mine lower than yours,why 9907?cuz its under the low of todays bar?mine is at 9859

--- 帖子 #675 ---
I took a cheeky long on a$ was up 19 pips but stopped out. was trading on my second a/c as I've hit my target for the week. When I posted, A$ could have gone either way. .9907 was the next swing low minus 3 on my chart. N$ was the ticket but the swing on the 15 minute look like a congestion zone rather than a peak. I'll post a chart.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Took 19 pips on a$ and finished for the week. A/Y was another good one.N$ is doing well. Peaks and troughs. Any one else got anything to show??

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi Bogus,do you carry trades over the weekend? Tedge

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Tedge, I never carry them over. I couldn't relax knowing I didn't have a Stop. Have a good weekend

--- 帖子 #679 ---
why don't you put a stop in then Bogus?are you telling me something I don't know?don't stops count over the wknd? Tedge

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Also if you put a stop..... and after the WE price opens with a gap against your position , the trade will be closed @ that price....... e.g. if you have 30 pips SL, and price opens 300 pips against you.... your loss is 300 pips........

--- 帖子 #443 ---
thanks Aztrader2

Hi kevin, please can you tell me what platform you use as the platform i use does not have average price. thanks
