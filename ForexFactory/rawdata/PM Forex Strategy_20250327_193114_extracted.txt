Introducing the PM Forex Strategy:

P - Price Action

M- NonLagMA

Entry:

Illustration 1.

BUY:

1.  When candle 1 closed, the NonLagMa will turn GREEN.

2.  Wait for confirmation - if candle 2 closed and the MA is still GREEN.

3.  Open a BUY at the open of candle 3

SELL:

1.  When candle a closed, the NonLagMa will turn RED.

2.  Wait for confirmation - if candle b closed, and the MA is still RED.

3.  Open a SELL at the open of candle c.

EXIT:

Two ways to EXIT the trade:  (we opened a BUY trade on the open of Candle 3), and we exit the trade whether positive/negative pips.

1.  On a BUY trade, when we see 3 consecutive candles with LOWER HIGHS, we exit on the open of the following candle.  On a SELL trade, when we see 3 consecutive candles with HIGHER LOWS, we exit on the open of the following candle.

OR,

2.  On a BUY trade, when the NonLagMA changed to RED was confirmed, we EXIT the trade.  On a SELL trade, when the NonLagMA changed to GREEN was confirmed, we EXIT the trade.

- Whichever comes first.  In this case, we were supposed to exit the trade "earlier," and did not wait for the NonLagMA to change color.

Illustration 3.  Sample of losing trade as we exit.

As we open the trade at the open of the Candle 3, the next candle closed against our position, and NonLagMA changed color, therefore we exit the trade on a loss at the open of the next candle.

LOTSIZE (updated June 25, 2010):

Lot size will depend on the equity and the minimum allowed by broker.

We will use the 1:1000 integrity for opening the trade.  Meaning, the lot size of 0.001 of the equity is to be used everytime we open a new trade.

Example, if our equity is 1000 usd, we will use 1usd per pip.  As the equity grows, so will our lot size.  Roundup to the nearest dollar.

Let us say the minimum lot size allowed by our broker is 0.01 (10 cents per pip) and our equity is 128 usd, therefore we open 0.01 lot size only.

If our equity reached 151 usd, we open a 0.02 lot size, because we rounded up the lot size.

So far, manual testing from May 1 - June 18 EURUSD on m30 timeframe yielded some 2000 pips.  M15 timeframe around 1800 pips.  I was hoping someone can make an EA, so together we can test other pair and other timeframes.

Here's the best part, using the "variable" 0.1% of the equity as the lot size, the 10k usd demo account grew to 96k usd!!!

June 26, 2010 Update:

1. PMforex_NonLagMA_v1 made by EllisEdi (updated - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...8&postcount=71)

2. MTF-NonLagMAv7.1_4TF_Bar and NonLagMAv7.1 must be downloaded together (MTF untested, with some errors reported)

3. Candle_Time shows the time left before the candle closes

4. #MarketPrice shows the current price in nice big font.  Since I dont know how to use most of the indicators that comes with it, I usually turn the OTHER SETTING off - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&postcount=90

June 27, 2010 Update:

1.  Removed the MTF-NonLagMAv7.1 and the NonLagMAv7.1, though it can still be found here, as posted by Vince-AC - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...6&postcount=51

2.  Adaptive Laguerre Filter indicator uploaded, from LouG's ALF thread - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239353

July 3, 2010 Update:

1.  Removed the following indicators CANDLE TIME and MARKET PRICE, but it can be accessed thru http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=407.  Also added the TRENDLINES indicator as uploaded by Syahmi.

2.  Added the MP (multi-period) and MTF (multi time frame) NLMA indicator, as uploaded by gspe - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3848753

3.  Reminder, other NLMA versions can be found here, as uploaded by Vince-AC - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3828616.  The NLMAdot indicator is also added in the list - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3845355

4.  Adaptive Laguerre Filter indicator was removed, but there's a more comprehensive discussion here at LouG's ALF thread - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239353

5.  Uploaded a new PMforex template for your perusal.

http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/638/forexg.jpg

SETTINGS:

1.  EU (could be other pairs)

2.  m15 (could be other TF)

3.  MP-NLMA - 7,21,84,336

4.  MTF-NLMA - m15, m30, h1, h4

As per suggestion, to avoid CPU overload, you can delete one of the MP or MTF indicator.

ENTRY:

1.  If either MP-NLMA or MTF-NLMA has 4 green bars (BUY), or 4 blue bars (SELL), we open a trade.

TP:

1.  Usually 10-15 pips.  But it all depends on the experience of the trader.  Another option is if any 1 or 2 of the MP/MTF bars change colors.

EXIT/SL :

1.  Still using the Illustration 2 as shown above.

2.  Under study:  Use the semafor and Heiken Ashi as exit strategy, as being used by Fokusnik - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=393

NOTE:   If EllisEdi has some free time, and he read this, I hope he can help us come up with the new EA.   This existing EA he developed can be found here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3835215

August 19, 2010 Update:

1.  Added the nice THV Coral indicator, as explained by NiceGuy from this post onwards - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=554  (Indicator posted by maxwell-eqtn - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=621)

September 4, 2010 Update:

1.  Removed 4BARS-MP-NLMA 1.01.mq4, as NLMA is more useful, and if put together, they eat a lot of cpu resources.  But the MP-NLMA indi can still be found here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3848753

2.  New version of #Market Price (no need for CandleTime indicator), as modified/posted by ducke - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=686 - #MarketPrice.mq4

3.  Nice, sweet and short summaries, as posted by NiceGuy here:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=632
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=654
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=701

4. New MTF-NLMAv2 by EllisEdi, but "untested" in live environment yet - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=691 - 4BARS-MTF-NLMA 2.mq4

UPDATED Entry Rules:
http://i54.tinypic.com/35mm9vp.jpg

1.  Make a BUY/SELL trade with the direction of the arrow (as provided for by the MTF-NLMA indicator), on the NEXT CANDLE, after the arrow have shown up.

2.  Filters:

-  PA candle must be small

-  PA must be near the TH4 Coral

Look at the samples, the ones with the GREEN lines are good entry points.  The ones with RED lines are bad entry points.

Ignore the green/red vertical lines, they indicate london open/close hours; as posted by jimsforex - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=711

Sample of string of wins (except in box)

Sample of string of losses (except in box)

Jun 16-18, 2010

http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/2913/forexe.jpg

After the 150 manual demo trades from May 1 to Jun 18, 2010

74 wins

76 loss

net of 1980 pips

and almost 10x the original equity if we use the variable 0.1% of the equity everytime we open a trade.

WHY?  Because trades exited with a loss are usually smaller than trades that exited with a win.

Too bad my programming skills is non-existent.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Have you test this on non trending period?

No offence but i think this works only in trending market.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
No offense taken.

With manual testing, we can only do so much, but string of losses is not uncommon too, as shown.  But somehow, with our exit strategy, it somehow minimizes the size of losses.

Of course, in some cases, it can also missed out on some huge trends, as we have the tendency to exit early, also shown in the charts above.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I'll select a non-trending period to conduct the back test.

Time will be 1500 to 2359(GMT+8)

Thats the London and US Market.

Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Your charts indicate you are exiting on 2 lower highs rather than 3.

On shorts you're exiting on 2 higher lows.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Oh, yes, I stand corrected.

http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/2898/forexb.jpg

Candle 0 - reference

Candle 1 - 1st lower H

Candle 2 - 2nd lower H

Candle 3 - EXIT at the open of this candle

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Sample of NO Trade.

NO CONFIRMATION - second candle after the change of NonLagMA did not give confirmation.

Very interesting stuff brother. I have just started giving it a try on m15 and just bagged 50 pips due to sudden movement on jpy pairs. Have you tried the strategy on H1+ Tfs?

Omar

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Not yet.

Started out on m15, then m30.

Was really hoping the good EA programmer guys can give this a shot.

Thanks for the review.  Keep posting your results and some charts will be great too.

Btw, you are on the right track, this is not a get quick 100 pips strategy, rather than a ride-the-wave-if-with-trend and get-out-if-on-opposite-trend, with a projected 2:1  W/L ratio.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I like simple things like this.

I just bunged $10 on a micro to demo it. I like to demo with a live micro rather than demo especially when using market orders. You get real results rather than perfect execution and fills.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
True, the edge of the system comes out only if we suck up the pips of a full swing instead of taking 10/20 quick pips and get out.

On m15, if the entry is good, price will immediately move in your direction without any hassle. And it can give anywhere near 50 pips before the exit signal. So a good stop could be a manual one with candle closing above the candle you entered in a position.

On m15, divide your position in 3. Close first one on 20 pips and move SL to breakeven. Let the remaining ones run to full extent. On 40 pips, close one more position and leave the last running till its either stopped out or exit signal appears. Doing so, many time you will feel that you left pips on the table. But on the longer run, your winning positions will out run the losing ones (You are cashing the position, saving what you put in the trade and also bagging the maximum pips a trade has to offer).

If the entry doesn't work out and bar CLOSES above your entry candle than you are most welcome to enter in opposite direction as soon as the conditions are met

I have a bit different setup than that is posted in the first post. I will post some of my charts in a while.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Just loaded onto GBP/USD and EUR/USD and so far looks pretty good.  I will demo it for a bit and see how it goes..

Has anyone created an EA for this?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hey noel, could you post a tpl?

really like your gray colors and get it quite right.

easy on the eyes.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I whipped this EA out for you guys. I only tested it via the strategy tester so please forward test. I was a bit confused by your Lot size rules so i used a standard formula instead.  Since no source code for the NonLagMA indicator (I only have source code for v 7.1) the EA must have the indicator NonLagMA.ex4 in the indicators directory.

The ea is pretty well documented and I beleive the defaults all match your trading system as posted.

Good Luck ...

--- 帖子 #16 ---
wow, very fast.....btw just closed EJ 55pips....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
don't know if MM set up right. if I change lots to .01, does it mess up MM?

anyway, stuck it on 6 pairs, we will see.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
The Money Management in the EA ...

If AutoMoneyManagement is set to false then the Lots value is used as the default lot size amount.

If AutoMoneyManagement is set to true (the default) then Lotsize is calcluated based on the Risk variable, the account balance of your account and the stoploss (which is set to the value of the EmergencyStopLoss by default)

If you want to use MM you can increase the risk number for bigger trades or lower the risk number for smaller trades.

There is also a way to set the stop loss and take profit as a fixed values. this will allow another exit goal in addition to the ones mentioned in the method.  This will effect the Lotsize if you have AutoMoneyManagement set to true.

Mark

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Do you have a rule for SL?

Sasa

--- 帖子 #20 ---
OK, well when you said you used a standard formula I didn't know if you meant lots. so it will break it down in to mini lots.

Also, here is a pic.  It looks like this should be a short as I understand it.

No trades yet.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Mine is operating properly...

I use a different broker so my NonLagMA values are a bit different than yours. My short did not trigger where it looks like it should because of the NonLagMA indicator. It is a little sloppy and allows both the Up and Dn value to be populated at the same time while still changing the color. It is implied that the color should be yellow when this happens, but since I do not have the source code I can not tell exactly what is supposed to happen. I can only use the three output values supplied by the Indicator. In order to check for a change in direction I made the following rules.

*********Techie Explanation**********

From Red(down) to Green(up) , a long signal,

-- 1 candle back the NonLagMA Dn value must be Blank

-- 2 candles back the NonLagMA Dn value must be Blank

-- 3 candles back the NonLagMA Dn value must NOT be Blank

This means that the 3rd candle back used to be down or switching color

and the 2nd candle back must be up,

and the 1st candle back must be up.

This gives us 2 confrimed candles.

From Green(up) to Red(down) , a short signal,

-- 1 candle back the NonLagMA Up value must be Blank

-- 2 candles back the NonLagMA Up value must be Blank

-- 3 candles back the NonLagMA Up value must NOT be Blank

This means that the 3rd candle back used to be up or switching color

and the 2nd candle back must be down,

and the 1st candle back must be down.

This gives us 2 confirmed candles.

*****End Techie Explanation**********

My Short for that color change occured at your chart time of 19:30. Did yours trigger yet?

If you have the time could you open the data window on your platform then record the NonLagMA, Dn, and Up values for each candle from 3 candles before the color change to 6 candles after. If you can pm me or post them It would help me see if this is actually what is happening.

Mark

--- 帖子 #22 ---
OK, thank you. no signals yet.  Sometimes only an up or down value.

-3  U 23558

-2 U 23601

-1 U 23642

0 U/D 23654 (same value both)

1 U/D 23645

2 U/D 23546  (slight blip up)

3 D 23619

4 D 23593

5 D 23 547

Should have a sell on usdjpy at close this bar.  I am getting the confirm arrows, just no trades.  Maybe I have something set wrong.

TY for looking.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Didn't have "allow live trading" in tools options checked even though i did in expert props.

Not sure this matters on a demo?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes, both need to be enabled. By turning the one in the expert properties off it  allows you to run the EA without making the trades, for testing or if you want to use it as an indicator. there are also comments... change the font color to see them better ...

Mark

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Nope, got the red sell arrow on jpy, but no trade.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
this looks like a really good system...since you just posted today, how much live trading success have you got so far, and which pair seems best? (30M t/f, correct?)

thanks,

jacob

--- 帖子 #27 ---
On the entrance of the 3rd candle...are you entering at market or when price surpasses a few pips above/below the high/low of candle 2?

thanks

jacob

--- 帖子 #28 ---
He has already given the details in post# 1 and 2.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Desi...i think post 2 were demo trades only...I might be wrong though.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Here you go.

post# 1
So far, manual testing from May 1 - June 18 EURUSD on m30 timeframe yielded some 2000 pips. M15 timeframe around 1800 pips.

post# 2
After the 150 manual demo trades from May 1 to Jun 18, 2010

74 wins

76 loss

net of 1980 pips

--- 帖子 #31 ---
so, post 1 is demo, post 2 is live?  if so, I didn't catch that...my bad.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
All demo it seems.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi iamnoel,

Refer your first post, buy 1,2,3 illustration.

Although MA is green, candle marked '2' is bearish, still it is a valid buy signal?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I just had two trades trigger one on gbpusd and the other on eurjpy ...

so it looks like it should be ok.

What are the differences between your broker and mine ...

your broker is a 5 digit broker?  if yes turn off the auto money management and try using a lot size of 0.1 or 0.01

chart time is different so make sure Use Trading session is set to false.

What is the balance in your account (demo i hope)?

Is anyone else having issues with the EA?

Mark

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I tested the EA with default settings ... it gave small profit from 1 June to 24 June .. 18 trading days ..

However I optimised trading session times and Fixed TakeProfit and StopLoss and got magic results .... it went to 19000 from 10000 but then down again .. to end with total of $1472 ..

I got these results with trading hours 7 to 18 Fixed SL of 60 and Fixed TP of 170 ... drawdown was rough ... some 40%

One could reduce drawdown .. but then profits are not so hot ... like $800

I am attaching the Report here so all can see

Regards

ECFOREX

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Made the MM false.  I am 5 digit.

Comment says Waiting for Byy/Sell opportunities.  we will see

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you for your input.  Maybe we can incorporate that in the EA soon?  I welcome inputs that can make this idea work better, and will post updates in the First Post.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Many, many thanks.  I will try this out as soon as possible later, as I have to ready myself and dress up for work in a while.

Btw, can you please upload the v7.1 NonLagMA?  How does it compare to the one I have in Post#1?  I got that it from FF too.

Maybe you can post some charts of your testing too, if not too much to ask.

I will update the First Post later to try to explain the MM better.

P.S.  @EllisEdi, Is it ok for me to download the EA, and renamed it to PMForexEA and upload it to the First Post?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Yes, right now, it is our EXIT strategy as posted.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yes, the SHORT trade is valid at the open of the 2nd to the last candle in your chart - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&postcount=20

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Not much live trading was made yet.

Of the 150 trades tested, I did around less than 20, and have around 13 losing against 7 wins, about BE in live trading in terms of pips.

I think the idea is to have an EA run 24/5 because we will never know when winning and losing trade will come up.  Obviously, it is humanly impossible for one to stare at the charts all the time.

I hope you can help test it manually or with the EA as posted by EllisEdi - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...9&postcount=15

If confirmation from the previous candles are there, we enter the trade at the OPEN of the 3rd candle.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes, it is a valid BUY signal.  In fact, I noticed around 60-70% of the time, if candle 2 pulls back, usually it is a winning trade.  As long as when the candle closes, the NonLagMA did not change the color.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Nope, just got sells on eur and gbp, but no ea trades.

guess i will go manual on this one

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi, sorry, I am really no-good in doing all these stuffs, but I have uploaded a screen shot on how the color combination came about, maybe you can upload the template here, so I can add it in the First Post.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Sure you can change the name and post. You can do anything you like to it. that is why I post the source code ( It is based off of a templeate EA I wrote for testing trading methodologies.

I can post some of my testing charts no problem.

It seems there might be a bug in with brokers using 5 digit pricing, I am still trying to figure out why no trades for stifland.

Mark

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I will make a debug copy of the EA for you to use. Then you can run it and send me back a log file which I can use to figure out why it will not run properly with your broker.

This might sound like a silly question but does your broker allow EA trading? Do you have any other trading EA's that run with your broker?

Mark

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks, i must say I can't seem to find it in the template folder myself.

it is saved in my program but not sure how to upload, sorry

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Well , this is a new demo, but everything on website states it sure does.  It is actually the official broker of one ea running at FPA.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
First u have to save it as a template.  Then go to your mt4 file and it will b the first templates file u come to ( not the template file under experts ). And there u will see it by whatever name u save it under

--- 帖子 #50 ---
well, i did that. I can even load it to a chart, but I don't see in file folder thru explorer or upload tool. weird.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
here are a few more, keep up the nicework

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Whoa!?!  What are these?

Indicators?  How does this differ from each other, and the one we have at Post #1.  Thank you for your interest.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
found. under app data. circuitous route

--- 帖子 #54 ---
don't remeber exactly what the difference of each one is.....just my collection of the latest nonlagsma that i have. don't know if they will be any use to you or not. i just saw where you asked for the latest one. btw, i love this simple little idea that you have..............vince

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I noticed the NonLagMAv7.1 indicator yielded THE SAME as the NonLagMA.

But the MTF-NonLagMA Bar, how do we set it up?  I got ALL REDs line up?  (Or ALL BLUEs)

.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi.... Is there any possibility to add micro account as well on your ea, instead of standard account ? I tried to change it to micro acct, but it didn't work... TQ

--- 帖子 #57 ---
You're the man!

Basically, the EA is working very good in Strategy Tester.

But some problem in MM, one thing I dont understand is why it opened with 0.20 lot, when the starting equity is 10,000usd?

RESULT posted:

EU, M30, May 1, 2010 to June 18, 2010.  Will try to test other date/year and TF in a while.

In h1 timeframe, doesn't look good.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi EllisEdi,

I have made a few minor mods to the EA that allow it to automatically recover the Magic Number (UniqueEaNumber) from global variables.

This means that once you set it up for a currency, every time you drop the EA on a chart of that currency, the EA will automatically get the magic number.

For this to work, the UniqueEaNumber external variable needs to be set to -1.

The order of execution is

(1) EA shows parameter dialog. If you set a value in UniqueEaNumber other than -1, it will use that value and skip step (2).

(2) EA looks at Global Variable named MarksNonLagEA AUDJPY UniqueEaNumber and reads its value.

(3) EA writes the value of  UniqueEaNumber into the above global variable.

The code for this has been appended at the end your source file.

I have also changed the SectionOnRequirements2 external variable to "NonLagMA_v7.1" (this may or may not be correct).

I also have changed the 9 lines of code that reference the above indicator to use the above variable instead of having a hard-coded filename.

I have also added a new external string variable that shows the version number of the EA, just for our peace of mind. When a user reports an error, he can also report that version number.

Please let know what you think.

Cheers,

Nick

hi EllisEdi,

i testet your EA over night and i think i discovered a bug. i had running a short order in profit but the EA refused to close the order so it went to long after hours. i have debugged through the code an added some debug messages.

after running some tests it shows an error 129 on closing the short orders.

after checking the manual some other EAs i have changed the following part of the CheckForClose()

Inserted Code  // if sell order
if(OrderType() == OP_SELL)
{
// if higher lows on last two closed candles
if ((Low[1] >= Low[3]) && (Low[2] >= Low[3]))

OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),[color=Red][b]Bid[/b][/color],AllowedSlippage,Blue);
commentStop = "CloseOrder reason: higher lows on last 2  candles.";
commentTakeProfit = "CloseOrder reason: higher lows on  last 2 candles.";
}
// if NonLagMa changes color (to green) for 2 closed candles
if ((NonLagMa1Up != EMPTY_VALUE && NonLagMa2Up !=  EMPTY_VALUE)&&(NonLagMa1Dn == EMPTY_VALUE && NonLagMa2Dn  == EMPTY_VALUE)) // on price went below current alf
{
//Print("CloseOrder reason Broke Current Alf="+Alf);
OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),[color=Red][b]Bid[/b][/color],AllowedSlippage,Blue);

is this the ea (.ex4)  or indicator?  if expert do we need new nonlag?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Money Management  uses a formaula based on the total balance in the account, the Risk number in the variables, the Stoploss assigned for the trade (mostly EmergencyStopLosss value unless using FixedStopLoss feature) and the value of a tick for the currency pair.

The formula (below) tries to limit the risk of the trade to the Risk percent.  So if Risk is 10 then If the StopLoss is hit your account should be down 10 percent.

Since this method does not really have a stoploss (I imposed a 500 pip Emergency stoploss as a default) I can re-write the mm formula to ignore the arbitrary StopLoss.  This weekend I will re-read your MM method in the first post and see if I can get it right.

Mark

The actual Formula used is :

Lots = NormalizeDouble(AccountBalance()*Risk/StopLoss/(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_TICKVALUE)),2);

FPA = ???

Forex Peace Army?

What is your Broker's name?  I will download the mt4 client and test to see what the issue is...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
The EA Should work on micro account with no problems depending on how your broker handles micro accounts.

Does your broker handle micro lotsize by using lots the size of .01?

Does your broker handle mini lotsize by using lots the size of .1?

and Does your broker handle standardlotsize by using lots the size of 1?

If so, then the EA should work just fine.

You also have a couple of options on how to run this EA.  If you set AutoMoneyManagement to false, you can set the Lot variable to whatever size you want.  Then every day you could increase it or decrease it as you monitor your trades.

Mark

P.S.  If you try to run this and it does not work properly, pm me or post about it and let me know your broker's name so I can download a demo version of it and debug it for you.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Good catch, (damn cut and paste !!! lol).  I have changed my source code and will send it to iamnoel sop he can post it on the first post.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Yes, please, EllisEdi.

But somehow, the results of further testing by Strategy Tester is not so encouraging...

--- 帖子 #66 ---
we need some filter for ranging markets. im experimenting with mtf rsi but this limits the number of trades too much i think.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
iamnoel,

Here is a new and improved, renamed EA. You can rename and alter the code freely.

Changes:
It should do the money management you want. If you leave the default risk at 10 then when you have 1000 in your acount your lotsize will 1/1000 of that based on the value of a pip in that currency. to see an example try running on EUR/USD, then on EUR/JPY The EUR/JPY lotsize will be slightly less because of the current value of a pip.

Bug fix of close of a sell order to the Ask price not the Bid price ...

I left the required Indicator as NonLagMA.ex4 as well since it aparently is the same as the latest version that I have source code for.

The accuracy of lot size will be down to 0.01

I did not include the global Unique number changes as I am still reviewing them and their purpose.

Mark

The New MM formula :

Lots = NormalizeDouble(AccountBalance()*Risk/100/(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_TICKVALUE)),2);

After a few PM's I should explain.

I do not trade live with Ea's.  I trade manually using a couple of indicators and discretion based on years of experience.  I enjoy programming so when I have time I write Ea's and indictaors for people for free (usually if a thread catches my eye).  I usually write these so that someone researching a method's profitablilty can get an idea of how it can work out and when they may have to "Change gears" due to market conditions.

I am not condemning trading with EA's.  Many people do.  I do not.  I just use them to learn and to test ideas.

Mark

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Upload is now working ... so here is the Updataed EA

Mark

--- 帖子 #72 ---
stifland,

I downloaded the demo mt4 for your broker and ran the new EA against it.  I started getting an Ordersend error 134 this means not enough money for the trade (see the expert and journal tab in MT4 or the Journal tab in Strategy tester).  Something is different with how your broker determines the Pip value - probably because you have an extra digit on each pair.  I will research more and get back to you.

In the mean time you should be able to set AutoMoneyManegment to false and set the Lots to what you would like (i.e. 1 or 0.1 I tried them both with success - but 0.01 is not a valid lot size with your broker)

OR if you want to use the Auto MoneyManagement set Risk to 1 (this setting seems to actually reflect the current MoneMangement as described for this method).

Mark

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Put it on several different ways edi. we'll see what happens.

I'm like you. Don't really use ea's to trade, but it is a puzzle

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Ea is working perfectly. Thanks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
would th errors be under the expert tab?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
This should be a sell. i have no errors anywhere, also no trade

Anyway, not gonna worry over it. Cheers edi.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
iamnoel, it is a very interesting system and of course I'm very impressed with the results.

It seems to me that we could avoid a lot of bad trades if we check a bigger timeframe.

Let's say we work with M-15. Then for the long trade:

1. When candle 1 closed on M-15, the NonLagMa will turn GREEN on M-15.

2. Wait for confirmation - if candle 2 closed and the MA is still GREEN on M-15.

3). After that we check H-1. If the NonLagMa on H-1 is ALSO GREEN then we open a BUY at the open of candle 3 on M-15.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hey everyone. The Nonlag MA is the same as a Nonlagdot, one draws a line, one draws dots. In the picture I have the NonlagMa (21), Nonlag dot (21) and then I placed a Nonlagdot (84) as a filter. I was thinking on a M15 chart - for a 1hour equivalent I would use 21 x 4 = 84. Seems to work pretty well.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
but H1 could ne green during formation of the candle and end in red !!!

but i agree on the mutiple tf idea, it saves you some bad trades

--- 帖子 #80 ---
cabbagepicker, I respectfully disagree. The NonLagMa doesn't repaint (at least so far I've never seen it repainting). It can change the color during the current candle formation, but after the candle formed - that's it, this part of the NonLagMa will never repaint.

And Nonlagdot repaints badly. Several times I saw it repainting the last 3-5 dots on M-15 and the last 2-3 dots on H-1.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
roundrock, you're absolutely right!

I think we have to look at both the previous hour's part of the NonLagMA and the current hour's part. If they're both green, the good chances are that the NonLagMA on H-1 wouldn't change the color.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
That depends on the Nonlagdot indicator you have. Plus, look at the INPUTS setting of the one that you have. There is a "color Back" line. If you have this, set it to 0 and it will not repaint.

If you are still concerned about it, just add another nonlagMA and set it to 84

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thank you, it is a very good idea!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks, updated the Post #1.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Brilliant idea. The 2 NonLagMA's crosses will be the one that should act as filter/signal right?

Does the NonLagMA has this exponential, smoothen, etc setting?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The MTF idea is great, and I think I have seen it posted somewhere here at FF.  Will try to search for it in awhile.  Got to run and do some errands first.

Guys, you are great, keep new ideas coming.  We might just persuade EllisEdi to use EA in trading afterall.  Hahaha, just kidding.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
iamnoel, in this post Vince-AC gave us a whole bunch of NonLagMA indicators, including a couple of MTF indicators.
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...6&postcount=51

I was very busy a couple of days and even didn't have a chance to take a look at these indicators... As far as I understand, these MTF indicators are based on a more advanced version of NonLagMA (the seventh version), but I'm sure that together we will be able to use them for your system.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hahaha .. of course, it is right under my nose.

But I hope someone can elaborate on how to set this MTF-NonLagMA indicator.  Having the same problems still as posted before - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&postcount=55

--- 帖子 #89 ---
iamnoel, it is strange that you have this problem.

I downloaded only two indicators, NonLagMABars_v7.1.mq4 and MTF_NonLagMAv7.1_4TF_Bar.mq4

And MTF_NonLagMAv7.1_4TF_Bar.mq4 seems to work.

Are you sure you put both of them in the same folder?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
My bad.  Thanks, finally got it to work.  Added the 84 NonLagMA and will manually test it again, using the 84 as the main trend.

I also updated the Post #1, to include other indicators (mostly for information and not for filter/trading), like CandeTime, and #MarketPrice Since I dont know how to use most of the indicators that comes with it, I  usually turn the OTHER SETTING to FALSE)

--- 帖子 #91 ---
just an updated version of the EA. Which indicator it uses is determined by one of the EA parameters, so you can change it to suit you.

[UPDATE] Please note that a newer version of the EA has been posted since I posted my changes, so I'd suggest you ignore my version and use the one posted by EllisEdi in this post

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I like what I saw here.. Thanks Iamnoel ... will try this one soon.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
In which folder/file must I save the NonLagma  EA.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
iamnoel, your chart looks really good, I'll do exactly the same. Thank you!

there appears to be a disconnect between the nonlagma.ex4 and the mtf v7.1.

on the 15 minute chart, the v7.1 in post 1 changes color one and sometimes two candles prior to the ex4 line.

has anyone else noticed this? is it repainting?

thanks

jacob

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi there....

Just followed steps outlined on post#1 but I still couldn't get the MTF to work...tried everything but to no avail...  I tried also another brokers but still the same... "mt4 hang"...

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I'm afraid you're right... I just noticed it too. And it is not repainting, as far as I understand the MTF just shows the wrong data. We need a professional programmer to fix it...

Until it is fixed I think we can just go from M-15 to M-30 and H-1 and just look at the NonLagMA on these bigger timeframes.

And, of course, as cabbagepicker and iamnoel suggested, I'll use NonLagMA (84) - probably it's gonna be the best filter.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
F:

thanks for confirming this. i thought my eyes were deceiving me.

of the nonlagma 84 you speak of, which file is it? the original ex4 file?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
We can and we will!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Yes, the same ex4 file, just go to "Inputs" and change the length from 21 to 84.

Probably it is also a good idea to change the colors, so NonLagMA (21) and NonLagMA (84) will look differently.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
F:

these two are very different. the 21 changes color much earlier...how does the 84 help? I cannot determine that myself with my very little experience.

thanks

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Added this note on Post#1:

MTF-NonLagMAv7.1_4TF_Bar and NonLagMAv7.1 must be downloaded together (MTF  untested, with some errors reported)

As for NonLagMA 21, I changed it to color blue.  I am using the NonLagMA 84 as the trend indicator.Attached the new screenshot, and the new template in Post#1

.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
losingtrades, since 84 is 4 times bigger than 21, it is supposed to show on M-15 the H1's trend.

So, let's say we work on M-15. 21 shows that according to iamnoel's rules we have to enter. If 84 is the same color as 21, we do enter. If their colors are different - that shows that we would go against the bigger trend, so if 84 shows at this moment different color - we don't enter.

That is the way I understand it. But of course I have to demo it A LOT!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
@losingtrade, I understand this is the graphical presentation of what Fokusnik is trying to explain to you.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Guys, sorry for off-top...

As iamnoel said, we need a lot of ideas. And if we want a lot of ideas, we need a lot of people reading this thread. Usually the threads with a high rating attract more people, so I think we all should vote for our thread.

Just my two cents.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
F:

that makes much sense...thanks...I would never have figured that out.

so, we can actually make a 4tf using 21, 42, 84, 336 with different colors.  but this would be very hard to keep track of i think.

thanks again

--- 帖子 #109 ---
EXACTLY!

But I'm so bad with the pictures!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Noel:

I see that...thanks...i put it on UJ chart with different colors and it appears to work fine.

have you determined a good way of using the 21 and 84 for trading

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes, I think 84 is enough.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I was thinking to use the 21 on 15M to gain small pip gains when not with trend, but when with trend, maybe larger pip gains.

any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
yes, I agree...I was really just checking my multiplying math skills

--- 帖子 #114 ---
We also should choose the pairs to work with. What do you, guys, think?

On M-15 I'm gonna try EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, GBPJPY and EURJPY.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
So, far, just like the regular MA cross trading, I plan to open BUY trade if NonLagMA 21 crossed above 84, and open SELL trade if 21 crossed below 84.

And like Fokusnik said, trade only in the direction of same color.

Well, at least, that is the plan ... hehehe

--- 帖子 #116 ---
That's what I thought!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
F:...good point. let's get Niceguy to be a regular on this thread. he is excellent and he can supply many excellent trading examples since you say you are bad with the graphs.

i dont even know how to get graphs here and i definitely dont know how to add words to graphs

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I think that you can change the lot size: if you go with the bigger trend, make the lot size bigger, if you go against 84, make the lot size smaller (IMHO).

--- 帖子 #119 ---
....

// if lower highs on last two closed candles

if ((High[1] <= High[3]) && (High[2] <= High[3]))

???

.....

// if higher lows on last two closed candles

if ((Low[1] >= Low[3]) && (Low[2] >= Low[3]))

???

High[3] or High[2]?

Low[3] or Low[2]?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
great suggestion...I am using UJ primarily...I lose too many trades when watching too many pairs. On a suggestion of Niceguy, I am sticking to one pair.

On UJ, I am seeing many 40 pip gains when 21 crosses 84 when looking back.

F:

your suggestion of lots changes makes a lot of sense. excellent idea.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Right now it makes a lot of sense. I'm sure in a little while you will be able to watch 2-3 pairs. With my current system I usually watch 2-3 pairs (GBPUSD, GBPJPY, EURJPY)

With this new system I'm gonna try seven pairs and choose 2-3 pairs that are the best ones.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
F:

you are much more experienced than me...I am sure you can handle it.

This is really good thread...just my 2 pips worth.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Maybe over the next few days, EllisEdi can find some time to work on V2.

I really think, sad to say, after doing some more EA testing on EU on different TF, for 2010, the original system seems to lose more than it can win.

Maybe with NonLagMA 84 as the filter/trend, this will fair better.

Right now, the idea for v2 is like this:

OPEN TRADES

BUY

- if NLma21 cross above NLma84, AND

- if NLma21 has the same direction/color green as NLma84

SELL

- if NLma21 cross below NLma84, AND

- if NLma21 has the same direction/color red as NLma84

EXIT TRADES

- needs some more study on the exit.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
How about a few alerts for those that like to manually trade...

1.alert one when Nlma 21 changes color

2.alert two when Nlma21 crosses 84 in same direction (for increasing lots)

any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
iamnoel, I just went through the last week manually, and the results are very good, on average 50-100 pips per pair per day. And if we have 6-7 pairs? Wow!

But I didn't use your exit rules. I exit with 3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_Alert.

I understand that you don't want to add a whole bunch of indicators (and you're right, the simpler - the better!), but I think that we need at least one indicator for the better exit, and 3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_Alert allowed me to add a lot of pips exiting at the better time.

If somebody wants to use it, go to inputs and change:

Period1 0.0

Period2 0.0

Period3 18.0

And I think that we all have to explain our best exit strategies, so we can choose the best one for this system.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
F:

Can you please give a little detail on how it works. i am somewhat a newbie and i have never seen an exit alert.

thanks,

jacob

--- 帖子 #127 ---
losingtrades, after you entered the trade on M-15, you wait until the "alert" - at that moment you'll see on the chart a new circle with the figure "3" inside it (and there is a popup alert, saying that the currency on M-15 is on the high or on the low). But it is just a sign that you must be careful and that probably you have to exit in a little while. You see, this circle can change, can repaint, it is possible that the currency will go further, and then the circle will repaint and switch to the new height.

So, what do we do?

When we see the circle on M-15 and see popup alert for the first time, we wait until the end of this candle formation. After that we look at H-1.

1). If H-1 doesn't have the circle, there is a good chance that on M-15 the currency won't go any further (it is also very helpful to take a look at M-15 Heiken-Ashi). So, at this case we go back to M-15 and exit.

2). If H-1 has the circle too, there is a good chance, that the currency will go much further. So, we stay on H-1 and don't exit. We keep watching the currency on H-1, and on H-1 the circle usually repaints at least 1-2 times. When we feel, that the H-1 trend became weak (for example, the Heiken-Ashi gets much smaller), then we exit the trade and go back to M-15 in order to catch another signal.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
F:

this is an excellent explanation but too much for my simple mind. Would you be so kind to show a graph with notes as examples?

when you refer to the circles, do you mean exit when the circles are different colors from the 21 or 84 line?

also, it appears that you are using two graphs, one 15M and one 60M. Are the setups the same?

sorry to bother you so much

--- 帖子 #129 ---
No bothering at all!

Yes, I enter on M-15 and I watch both M-15 and H-1; the same setup.

If our trade is long, we wait until a red circle above the candle, and if our trade short, we wait until the green circle below the candle, so you're right, we need a different color from 21.

On these two pictures I entered NZDUSD at 13:15; you can see, that the red circle on M-15 stayed above 19-45 candle, and on H-1 it stayed above 19:00 candle. That means, that the red circle appeared on both charts almost at the same time (as far as I remember, it was about 18:00) and I had to go from M-15 to H-1 and I was watching H-1 a little while, the circle repainted, and at 21:00 I saw that the H-1 trend is over and exited with 110 pips.

P.S. On Friday I was watching NDZUSD, AUDUSD, GBPUSD and USDCAD, I felt that it was gonna be a bad day for my favorite GBPJPY and EURJPY.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
this is excellent and simple to understand for my simple mind. thanks so much.

so, your setup on both charts are 21 and 84?

what indicator is on the bottom of each chart (boxes)? is that the one hour on the 15M chart and the 4 hour on the 60 M chart?

if so, how did you get them to show as boxes and not another line?

I understand your 15M entry...you are following noels rules, but I dont see the 60M line on your 15M chart?

are you only entering when they cross?

BR/Jacob

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Come on, guys!

Obviously, some of you have much better exit strategies! Please share!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
F:

your strategy makes good sense. nothing is perfect, but yours is simple to understand and appears to work.

thanks

--- 帖子 #133 ---
losingtrades, I showed you my Fridays charts, the way they looked on Friday and the way I traded on Friday.

The idea about 84 came later. I'm going to use 84 exactly like iamnoel recommended for the entry, and I will exit with semafor alert, like I explained.

My setup for both charts will be the same, I'll just add to the chart you saw NonLagMA 84.

The indicator on the bottom of the chart - Heiken-Ashi in the form of the bar, it shows Heiken-Ashi M-15 color on M-15, Heiken-Ashi H-1 color on H-1 etc. It is not a part of the system, I just got used to it.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
you the man, you and iamnoel are...this system is nice and simple for entry and exits. so many people on FF threads are awesome and generally so helpful.

sry...I forgot the 84 was new ()

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yes, with this strategy we're gonna kick some behinds!

--- 帖子 #136 ---
sry about too many questions. i am slow to understand most of the time.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I'm very glad that you ask questions, we all work together in order to make iamnoel's system even better, and the questions help us to do it!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
it appears on UJ:

when 15M is the same as 60M, then 15M changes opposite of the 60M and then after awhile, the 15M changes signal back to join 60M, and 60M never changed, this is sweet time even before a cross.

the 15M got whatever was in its sytem out and then re-joined back and now it appears to be pip city

sweet

--- 帖子 #139 ---
losingtrades, your questions are bringing answers that I for one need.  So please don't think they're dumb questions. (Or maybe we're both dumb??)  lol

I know most of you guys from the alf threads... Combine this as Entry (last rules from NOEL) and ALF+Daily pivot as exit. You guys have a powerful PIPS maker here.

Pop that in and take a look yourself. See what I mean.

Just sharing a word from my mentor:

"The problem is only come to you if you try to take what you want, when you supposed to only take what you need".

Dont forget to consult your trading plans, you will find your exits a lot  easier...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thanks NiceGuy, for dropping by.  Yup, seen a lot of familiar names from LouG's very good ALF thread - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239353

Please elaborate the exit on the Pivots?

A chart will be very helpful, too.

Hope you can drop by often, I am sure your insights will always be appreciated as well.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
NG...good to see you here man.

actually, I was using iamnoel's nonlagma in conjunction with alf last week studying the charts. the nonlag actually gives signals a little earlier than alf...but not always a good thing.

a combination of these is an excellent idea.

your the best man.

p.s.  I am still trying to get FF to change my login name.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
ok...i've got noel's 21 & 84 nonlag with lou's alf on UJ 15M.

will study it hard.

one day, maybe one day, we might find the perfect setup.

btw, you europe guys/gals should be sleeping already.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Yes, an ALERT option will be great!

Semafor looks like fun.

But, let me clarify #2, if H-1 has the circle too, there is a good chance, that the currency  will go much further.  Go further in the same direction you mean?  I thought the semafor circles signifies exhaustion point?

Can you kindly post the Heiken-Ashi Bar indicator, and how do we interpret it?  How do you determine if it is getting smaller?

Let's get this going, will re update Post#1 if we come up with something more concrete.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
noel...your comments many posts back was an excellent observation.

you said when nonlag 21 changes color, and the next bar is opposite, but nonlag stays on color, it is very likely a strong sign.

very nice

also, a flat alf can keep one out of a bad trade...remember lou's rule...dont trade when alf is flat.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
sometimes alf gives signal b4 nonlag 21, but nonlag 84 can keep you out of a bad trade.

there are many variations that I see on UJ...we just need to study and learn the best scenarios.

next week will be fun.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
This is EU M15.

I dont do   manual trade with  other pair and TF besides EU M5. I made this only to help others to see a basic way to take action near the S/R or pivots line. Some combination and varioation might occurs but if we understand the basic the rest will flow in with experience. In PSR business, better closing too soon than too late.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I put all the indicators in so any new guys in business can see how they react to real PA. But actually, we could do just great without them with only leaving daily pivots and S/R in.

PS: Pay attention to those candles that keeps gradually getting smaller near PSR lines. If you are late... They oftenly will shoots you back fast!

For example: Look at the last candle on the right!

Hope this helps...

Cheers

Good to see you here. I've been lurking since the beginning. Thanks to losingtrades.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
this has turned out to be an excellent thread. The two 21 and 84 lines make it so easy to begin planning a setup trade, along with iamnoel's and fokusnik's explanations. now with NG's picture, we get more insite for trade setup and pair action and re-action

good to see you here on this thread.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Yes, I meant "Go further in the same direction"!

The semafor is based on ZigZag, and ZigZag usually gives the signal of exhaustion TOO EARLY. Currency usually keeps going in the same direction, and the bigger the timeframe, the longer it keeps going. So, if there is only the circle on M-15, we wait until the end of the M-15 candle, because M-15 is not a big frame and currency after the alert goes in the same direction for a short time - 15 minutes, 30 minutes tops.

But if we see the alert circle not only on M-15, but also on H-1, then we have to remember, that on a long timeframe the currency after the alert keeps going in the same direction much longer. On H-1 it usually keeps going at least 1-2 hours, and the circle repaints. I've seen repainting on H-1 for 5-6 and even 8-10 hours! I've read one guy saying that he saw EURUSD on H-1 repainted 17 times!!!

I don't use Heiken Ashi Bar indicator for determining if it is getting smaller, I use it just to make sure, what is the color of Heiken Ashi. If somebody wants, you can upload this small bar indicator NH-1.

When I feel that the trend is getting weaker, I go to Heiken Ashi indicator itself (I have a different template for it).

On the picture I show two areas where it is getting smaller. As you can see, it is obvious, the "body" of the candle all of a sudden becomes much smaller than the body of the previous candle, the candle becomes much smaller than the previous candle, so I would exit immediately. But some people wait until the next candle, and if also small, then they exit.

NG...this is awesome...again. how do you keep coming up with these?

I have two questions...one is stupid, one is not.

1.stupid question first...on your graph, you have dotted lines for previous days low/high...how can I get that?

2.not so stupid question second...you mention daily pivot...how do you determine that...most currencies and i see go up and down and have several high/low points in any given day...how do you determine the current day's pivot point? (might also be considered a stupid question)

thanks man...you the best.

NOTE TO ALL...NG'S INSIGHTS ARE AWESOME...PAY CLOSE ATTENTION...HE REALLY HAS A DESIRE TO HELP OTHERS.

I ALSO THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST METHODS I HAVE SEEN ON ANY THREAD...THANKS TO MOSTLY IAMNOEL, FOKUSNIK, AND NG'S INSIGHTS.

i think my philosphy will be:

1. trade when 21 turns color...if in opposite direction of 84, then go for very small pips...maybe 5 to 10.

2. trade when 21 turns color same as 84, if in same diirection then go for a few more pips maybe 15.

3. trade when 21 crosses 84 in same direction, increase lots.

i am usually one for going for small pips and trading higher lots. i dont like trades out there for long...it is better for me to close out early with small pips and miss more pips than leave open too long and turn to loss.

and most importantly, dont take my trading advice. most likely, you are a better trader than me... i was just mentioning my possible strategy.

What's happening here? How can this be after your "manual testing from May 1 - June 18 on M30 timeframe yielded some 2000 pips."?

Perplexed...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I was able to add the #Pivot-point-vTEXT-v2 indicator, what is the m0-m1-m2 etc for?

Oh, you'd be surprised.  It happens a lot, after initial testing of a "system" for a couple of weeks or so, it can go from boom to bust!  That's why an EA can help you a lot in backtesting.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
If EAs would work, the big boys would not employ thousands and thousands of screenwatchers at their offices.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Exactly...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
iamnoel, as far as I understand, EA trades 24 hours per day, 5 days per week. A trader usually trades during active hours, like London open, NY open etc. I don't do any EA testing because I don't believe it could be close to manual backtesting. Is it possible that EA makes money during active hours and loses money during passive hours? I think so.

Is it possible to make EA trade during active hours only? Then we would be able to get some reliable results, something close enough to a real life trading.

And another thing. You do all the testing on EURUSD. But I think GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, GBPJPY, EURJPY on average perform better than EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
For the best results try to use to enter into the position as a filter, the indicator "sRs Trend Rider" (blue cross should cross the line 10000 and did not touch it), to exit using the nearest pivot-level.

Will do. But as you can see on the charts, EURCHF move would have given another 50 pips and USDCHF still running. I used hard 30 pips TP to exit instead of exiting according to the original rules of the system. But that was just for testing as I had calculated my risk/reward at the entry time and that was 1:2 as my SL would have been somewhere around just 12 pips right above the MA. I was also anxious to take out profit before moves goes the other way. Starting the day with positive trades gives gives a good feel and energy for remaining session

So I would highly recommend to take maximum pips out of any swing (or at least 50 pips) instead of exiting early like I did. I mentioned 50 pips because I have observed each GOOD swing in m30 is worth no less than 50 pips and your losing trades will range around 15 to 20 pips.

Cheers,

Omar

EU m15, short

Thanks for the heads up re EA.  Obviously, I am a total newbie in EA.  I thought it is the "answer"  hahahaha

UPDATE on EU m15 posted

--- 帖子 #180 ---
yes, multi timeframe thing gives better signals (in any method). i check M30 , if signal comes then check H1. if both agree then trade. else wait....

--- 帖子 #181 ---
exited USDCAD at loss using 3 consequitive higher candles method

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I have been lurking for a while thought I should comment.Its good to have a simple system like this, cause no matter how many indicators you combine its still a case of probability.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
iamnoel, I think H-1 is much better than M-15 and M-30. Of course, I need to demo it for a little while.

And don't pay attention to the EA results: your system is a very good system, we just have to avoid flat - like any system.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
And one more thing. When all the currencies show the same direction (for example, EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD - red line, USDCAD - green line) - it is usually a good thing, our chances are much better.

And if two biggest currencies, EURUSD and GBPUSD, show different directions, I would stay away for a little while.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I also prefer the higher time frames that reduces whipsaws,but if trading manually what do you think would be a good hard stoploss for this system cos this morning i got whipped out cos of a 15 pip stoploss, which would not have been so if I had used a bigger hard stop.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Excellent observations!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
With all the posting over the weekend , I am a bit lost as to current setup.  We are going with 2 nonlags for confirmation.

Candle time and market price just informational.

But is the Alf also incorporated somehow as a filter and how so?

Sorry if I missed that post.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Stif...

the weekend was a busy time for this thread. it was suggested by (I forgot) to help with longer term trends to use 2 nonlag's, one for 21 and one for 84 the 84 representing the hour.

it does help in making a determination on a 15M potential trade whether one wants to go against longer term trends.

Alf was also introduced by someone. many of us on this thread were regulars on the alf thread, and we all like the alf indicator. so, all these just help with filtering possible trades.

and Syahmi was kind enough to post the pivot indicator's, and of course, we got great insight from Niceguy.

hope this helps

--- 帖子 #189 ---
yes thanks.

so alf  user choice. may need to read that tread

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I just read your post below and made the v2 EA so that you can test the new strategy ...

Changes include

***** Entry when both NonLagMa's are in the same direction and FastNonLagMa crosses SlowNonLagMa (closed Candles).

***** Removal of programatic closing of trade. The defaults set a StopLoss and a Take Profit to take you out of a trade. You can also manually close trades.

Otherwise same basic features as before ...

//---------------------------

//-----Notes----------------

//---------------------------

--- 帖子 #191 ---
FYI,

The EA's I have posted here all include a UseTradingSession indicator.  when it is set to true then the EA will only open trades during the hours in the variables (StartTradingHour:StartTradingMinute through StopTradingHour:StopTradinMinute).  You can then use the EA on a different chart (change the UniqueEANumber) with different active hours in order to trade multiple Sessions.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
edi, wonder if it will fire for me. lol...will try later.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
can somebody help me find the correct indicators and setup. i am seeing several versions of the non-lags.

this is my requirement. i am little relaxed trader. minimum TF is M30. i want less noice. i am prepared to wait and wait for a good setup. would like H1 as entry with confirmation from H4. what could be the stoploss, tp ?

i am watching all 9 majors

Nonlag MA 21 is more or less identical to the movement of MACD default setup.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
cityboy, THIS system is new to me, but when I trade my favorite pairs on H-1, I usually use stoploss 60 and TP 100.

But this system seems to be less risky than the ones I used before, so I think for THIS system on H-1 I would use SL 50.

Here is a new subversion of the EA.

Changes include Pricing fixes for Mt4 brokers that use Fractional pips. An example of this is when the EUR/USD is at an accuracy of 5 decimal places (1.23589).

To enable this feature set BrokerUsesFractionalPip = true. It will automatically change the lotsize, Stop loss and TP values.

stifland, this should work on your mt4 as well. please let me know.

How do you filter your entry using them?   What pairs are you watching, if you dont mind me asking.

I am into EU (slow) and GY (fast) for testing purposes.  Sometimes, if I see good setup and I have time watching it, I trade live.  If not, I usually demo it, leave it and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Glad to see you have something that worked... Just train it well and share with us here.

Well..... I have study this system and my opinion is this system is better on Higher time frames above the M ones. If we a see a potential signal in H tf, we should look for entry on lower timeframes rightaway.

If someone look for signal in Hourly TF and based their entry at 3rd candles on the same timeframe, most time that would be too late and the price is already shooting back especially in ranging times or you have a strong S/R in front of the price. Just becareful.

I hope I am not being a party breaker here, but I highly recommend everyone who trade this manually to stick with one pair. Master that pair like your own play yard when we were kids. After that, you can squeeze pips out as much as you need from it from north and south, back and forth.

Taking too many decision in the same time for multi pair trading will only make your body and your brain exhausted too soon. You might win a lot at the start because your body and your brain is still fresh.

But after that, in longterms there's a big chance that you will have many hard time to make too many right decision everytime you do trading. That's where we begin to doubt our decision and our self confidence grow weaker, especially after we suffer many lost from making the wrong decision. That's bad for a longterm business like Forex.

I've been there. Just sharing the experience, so you guys dont have to go through it. But....well I also believe that everybody is  on his/her own way in this. Just do whatever you need to do to make MR Pips and it's family, friends, brother and sisters keep coming and coming to your bank...

NG...thanks for your insight...we all appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
NiceGuy, I would like to make sure I understand you. If the third candle on H-1 is too late, what do we do? Would you suggest wait not for the third candle, but just for the color change on H-1 and right after that (it would be the very beginning of the second H-1 candle) go to M-15 and if there is the same color's third candle - enter on M-15? Could you show us some pictures to illustrate what you mean?

P.S. NiceGuy, I'd like to say that I really appreciate everything you've done for this thread and for this forum!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I am not trading this system, I just tried it for a couple hours yesterday. I tell you what... Sometimes it's nice to see those color for trading compared to reading candle by candle trading like i do for live.

Btw If I do trading this, I might do this.... and this doesn't mean I am right...

EU H1
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The key is.."Sell is right after it bounce from ceiling and buy is right after it bounce from the floor".  It would be an easy job if we get used to spot the ceiling and the floor. That's why I always encourage people to learn and try to understand the pair's movement behaviour before trading it. But still I envy others who trade multi pair and succeed in long term. I also envy any of you who can bear to lose +50 pips in trading and still re-entering position right after it. How do you guys do that?

Pips is not everything in trading. Your bankroll is.

Good luck.

I agree with this 100 percent !!!!!  EA's are great for testing of approximately how successfull a trading method COULD be.  They are great in the development process of a Method because you can use the visual tester to see where you would have made trades and what would have happened.

One reason I write EA's and Indicators is to better understand a method (there is nothing like coding to fully understand the entry and exit rules).

NOTHING is a replacement to consistancy.  Watch the how the pair reacts to round numbers, watch how bottoms and tops are formed for that pair.  Use the strategy tester in visual mode to help you watch a replay of the market, this can help speed up the process but do not miss the "LIVE" sessions.  Search for the LFH Trading Simulator code, with this you can use the Strategy Tester built in with MT4 to replay the market and manually place trades.

The bigest clue to success is consistency.  I have used the same basic system for 3 years now.  It is boring, but it works for me.  In order to beat the Boredom I read the threads, write code for indicators and EA's (for others) and try new startegies in micro acounts (but always after I have made my trades in my main system).

Over time you will get a feel for the currency pair you are trading.  Along the way you will little tidbits about trading that fit your style and mentality.

Have you ever listened to an analysis or watched "over the shoulder" of a successful trader?  Usually there systems are not purely mechanical.  It looks like they can see the future sometimes.  These traders have gotten the flow of the currecny pair they trade.  Of course there is a lot more to becoming a solid trader.  A Method that fits you, solid money management, a good mental attitude (very improtant), and experience.  For most of us, the more you trade and read and learn the better you can become.

Sorry for the rant ...

That's an ACE my friend... Mark the time..... UJ usually range just befor NY... Now train to rich yourself up with combination and the hidden ones!

Then try demo trade on it with 1:2 or at least 1:1.5 R/R. Like SL 10 and TP 20 or evenmore. That way you will still make money even when you only right less than 50%.

How bout that?

S:

the mtf is not working...the bars on the M15 change color too early...look at it closely...tell me if I am wrong

--- 帖子 #251 ---
losingtrades, the new MTF indicator is based on NonLagMA_v7.1, and NonLagMA_v7.1 is a little bit more smoothed than NonLagMA. So, if you compare MTF with NonLagMA, there will be some difference, especially on the small timeframes.

And I like that it is more smoothed, I'll probably work with MTF only, without NonLagMa itself.

And about bars changing colors too early: it doesn't depend on the MTF indicator, it is a result of the volatility. And the bigger timeframe - the more stable the colors, I would never look on M-5. M-15 is much better, but the color can change during the candle formation, it's normal.

Jacob,

I take that as a compliment.

Nice to see people are getting good trades with this.

As for me?  Still "training" mode

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Yeah, same request if possible.

Question, since this is MTF, when a m15 closes, it means, at the moment a new m15 bar comes out, there's a possibility that several bars on h4 will repaint?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Just delete the #MarketPrice indicator from the template,

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Lets trading guys!

I hope I did not forget to tell you to sell once it bounces from seiling.....

Hi,

it's possible to change the indicator from higher-to-lower TF bars to lower-to-higher TF i have to rewrite the indicator.

If you want tell me and i'll take a look to the code

--- 帖子 #264 ---
hi noel,

yes there is the possibility that several bar will repaint

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Yes... please rearrange the sequence.... TQ.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Syahmi,

this version should work, use the parameter MTF_Hi_to_Lo to choose the preferred order

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Thanks a lot gspe.... I appreciate it....

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thank you too.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
could you post update on the rules. Are they the same as in post 1, just with the 84?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hello Sayami,

What is the indicator and settings in your chart?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #271 ---
How about MTF for normal Moving Averages?  Does anyone have it?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
It's MTF_NonLagMA_v7.1...

Hi, Im really newbie in this forum and in forex also.

Sorry, but my english is not good.

I' try this system with the Syahmi's EA PMForex_NonLagMa_EA_v2_1

I've seen your last setup, and if is non an exagerate request, can i  ask you if you can share and add all the indicators and the template also you us it in last post, so I can experiment it

Thanks all  for job and help.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
My nonlag bars are not showing at the bottom of my chart

in the indicator section......, it is blank!

Any help?

Hi there.... you need this indy (attached)... add into ur indicator folder.

Yesterday I tried demoing this system for the first time and it was great. Wonderful. Today, everything I do goes against me. I wanted a simple clean chart and I'm using the EU 15 & H1. I have been reading NiceGuy and Fokusnik and loosingtrades and have learned what I know but that's not getting it today like it did yesterday. I have been using the semifor for entry and exit. Following Fokusnik's advice. I have Alf and 21 on my chart and SR. I want this to work. Is the EA still doing it's thing?

Thanks guys. I appreciate all you are doing. I'm in the process of reading the whole thread but interruptions make it difficult.

I think this is gonna be good if I past today!

Thanks again.

s

Jacob, where are you!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
sanyhuis, I'm very sorry that today everything went against you, but frankly speaking I don't understand how come.

I don't trade EURUSD, I prefer other pairs, but let's take a look at the charts.

On M-15 we can see a perfect entry after London open - at 10:00 AM. I showed it in a circle. IT IS PERFECT! It is a third candle according to iamnoel's rules, and at this moment all four MTF's dots are aligned. So you could enter 10:00 AM 1.2246

When the currency got a semafor alert on M-15, it also got a semafor alert on H-1. So you should go to H-1 and watch it there. You can exit right now, 1.2407 (and that would be 161 pips!), but the Heiken Ashi on H-1 is still strong, so I would wait a little longer.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hello Sayami,

Thanks for all the help. Here are 4 signals to buy. Three are winners and One is a looser,..... not bad for today !!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Great trading day!!!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
sanyhuis, and one more thing.

You said: "I wanted a simple clean chart"

On the other hand, you said that you also have ALF and SR.

I don't want to offend anybody, and I do know that some of the people here are much more experienced than I'm, but in my humble opinion you have way too many indicators: NonLagMa (21), Alf, SR, semafor.

For example, I use for the entry NonLagMA (21), my MTF is the same NonLagMA, it is just convenient to have MTF, but both NonLagMA (21) and MTF show the same data. And you use for entry NonLagMa (21), Alf and SR, and these indicators are based on a very different principles and show the data differently and if you are not very experienced, it could make a lot of confusion.

And the same with exit, as far as I understand you use now for the exit ALf, SR, semafor, Heiken Ashi. The same thing - way too many indicators...

I like iamnoel's system for its simplicity and clarity, basically it has ONLY ONE indicator (NonLagMA) that works pretty damn good whether it is 21 and 84 or 21 and MTF.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Well, today is an exceptional day for European Cross as they Rocketing to the moon....

Some traders will got heavy crashed, some will make huge profits. Oh well.. This is just another day in forex business...

--- 帖子 #286 ---
that is a sweet interpretation...it helped me out.

thanks,

jacob

--- 帖子 #287 ---
jacob, I live in Ohio, but I decided that I'm gonna make it on Forex, so I sleep during day and trade both London and NY.

But I understand, that some people can't enter at 10:00 AM. But if you go to H-1 and if you watch several different currencies, not just EURUSD or USDJPY, you'll probably find some good entries before NY Open and after NY Open.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
sanyhuis, I never use the semafor for entry! I use it only for exit. It is important!

I use NonLagMA and MTF for entry (according to the iamnoel's rules). I use the semafor and Heiken Ashi for exit.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
hey...what about your business that you run? giving it up?

btw, you will do great at forex.

for me, right now, trying to work a day job (pays the bills), balance family and forex. I need to get into the habit of waking up at 4:00am EST to trade london.

-Jacob

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Thank you Fok. I should have said "I went against everything"rather than say It went against me. When I saw the semifor on the H1 I kept jumping the gun on entering and ended up with 2 huge sells that should have been buys. I finally pulled out the papers I had printed with your instructions and began to reread. From there on it went well. I've still got 2 big bad trades but I have a feeling tomorrow will help take care of those or maybe they will become long term trades. Anyway, I've read the whole thread now and while I'm doing and am comfortable with EU, I also like GU and am familiar with it as well. In this early stage I'm happy with what I have, but am keeping my eyes open for another pair. Hopefully it will be GU, or GY. I will sit down in a bit and look over the indi's and see what can be done with them.

Thanks so much for your time and thoughts in helping me with this. It's not often I find something I'm comfortable with and I am with this one. Getting more so each hour.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Jacob, I'm in the internet-based business, so I can handle both business and Forex for a little while.

I'm sure that thanks to this thread and thanks to iamnoel we all are going to do great at Forex.

Waking up at 4:00 AM EST is probably a very good idea! Good for you!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
sanyhuis, I'm glad that you understood your mistakes, now you're gonna do just fine! We live and we learn!

I think for this system GBPUSD is better than GBPJPY. For this system I also like AUDUSD and NZDUSD.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I'm glad to hear that. While I would like to trade the GJ, it's a bit too much for a beginning system. I might have to save that for later days. I do like GU. Aud and NZ sound very interesting too.

Thanks for all the help. I crammed this whole thread in this afternoon while watching the charts. I bit of a headache now but after awhile it will all sink in where it needs to go. I think it's going to be a very profitable business, this thread. I haven't seen one that felt so good since Geoff's GB H1 EA. That one is a prize also.

PS How is the EA working on this one? Anyone tried it yet?

Again, thanks for all your help.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
sanyhuis, I agree!

I have a VERY GOOD feeling about this system, never felt like this before! NEVER! I don't just think that we'll succeed, I KNOW that we'll succeed!

And what is very important: this system works on any timeframe, so everybody can use it for his favorite timeframe! Just look at Syahmi and maxwell-eqtn - they kick butts on M-5!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
sanyhuis, before this system I traded mostly GBPUSD, GBPJPY and EURJPY, never traded EURUSD. But of course EURUSD is very good for this system. I looked at the history, went through my notes, looked at the last week's trades and decided: next week with this system I'm gonna trade EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD and NZDUSD.

I think we can trade GBPJPY and EURJPY with this system too, and it can be very profitable, BUT we have to be very careful, someting like this: if EURUSD and USDJPY go in the same direction, we can trade EURJPY, if GBPUSD and USDJPY go in the same direction, we can trade GBPJPY. So it is a VERY big BUT, and for now I agree with you - it's a bit too much for a beginning system!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Friends, you are very close to a very good system here!

I just wanted to suggest something. If you want to trade nonlagMA with higher timeframe confirmation then you might consider using just two MAs instead of the 4TF bars.

For example, if you want to trade M15 with H1 confirmation, you may use one nonlagMA period 20 and another period 80.

4TF bars include too much information, besides it is very often lagging.

P.S. My personal choice would be to use period 20 and period 80 for any timeframe. Or period 20 and period 160 if wanting to be more conservative.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Since almost all of the members of FF have more trading experience than you and me, maybe you should stick with one pair only like me. Then, master that, then move on.

Now, I am trading UJ 5M and I am learning fast with the help of so many great people on FF. If you work too many pairs, it can lead to brain exhaustion.

I am trading UJ, learning its every move. Then, when I can predict it better, I can increase my lots. This way, I trade less and choose the best possible trading opportunities.

Just look at NG's charts. he makes a few daily trades...trades EU, and gets in and gets out...gets his pips. Since he has almost mastered that pair, I am sure he is not trading .1 lots...probably much higher...less trades, less losses...choosing better opportunities.

Just my suggestion. Hope it helps.

Jacob

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Indrek, it is a very good idea and I'm sure some of us will follow your advice. The simpler - the better!

Yesterday I tried to compare NonLagMA(84) and the third bar (H-1's bar) on M-15. It seems that their signals are almost the same. But I haven't tested it long enough, so maybe I'm wrong. Obviously we need much more tests.

Maybe you're right about MTF bars giving too much information. When I work on M-15, I look mostly at the bottom bar and the third (H-1) bar. But on the other hand 3 bars' alingment shows better signal than 2 bars' alignment and 4 bars' alignment is a better signal than 3 bars' alignment.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
EXACTLY!!!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi,

from looking at the chart with 4BARS-MTF it seeams to be very good for scalping, if you look at the arrows with 4 point conformation you are almost sure to get 5 pips easily.

If you risk 10% of capital with 10 pips a day you can turn 1.000$ to 1 million in less than a year...

gspe

P.S.

I'm still learning forex but i like it

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I am afraid that you cannot do objective visual backtest with any MTF bar indicators.

Remember that when the color of MA changes on hourly timeframe then on M15 chart up to four H1 bars change color at the same time.

That is the main reason why nonlagMA period 80 is better - it is always up to date!

Sorry if my explanation was messy. I just did not find the best words as English is not my native language.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I just tried to explain why backtesting with such indicators does not give proper results. See my previous post.

I am an old multitimeframe trader, so I know the basic tricks with MTF indicators

Any MTF MA indicator does not make sense. You just have to multiply the period of the same MA indicator and that's it. If you want to have MA5 for different timeframes starting from M15 then use MA10 for M30, MA20 for H1, MA80 for H4 etc.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
The best alignment when trading 15 min charts is M15-H1-H4. In this pattern M30 is totally useless because it does not work neither with M15 nor H1.

The best working correlation factors between timeframes are 4, 8, 16.

So, when trading H4 charts, the ideal confirmation would be, in fact, H16 and H64. Unfortunately, we do not have such timeframes. But when using MAs instead of bars you can easily choose 4 * period and 8 * period.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I think that there are other traders like me who hate having too many lines on the chart. For those, I suggest nonlagdot that is absolutely the same as nonlagMA.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Indrek, I didn't mean backtesting, I was trading demo and I had MTF and 84 on the same chart, so I was comparing them during live demo-trading. But it was just one evening, that's why I said that we needed more testing.

But now I got your point about changing colors up to four bars comparing changing color on a very small part of NonLagMA. You're right, I never thought about that! And I didn't understand you at first not because of your English (which is very good) but because I'm sleepy after London-NY and it's time for me to go to bed at 4:00 PM EST!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
hey Fok...get some sleep before your sleepiness causes you to enter into a hasty trade

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Here is an illustration of this. At the bottom of the chart I have MTF bars period 20 and on the chart you see nonlagMA period 80.

It is easy to see the difference in color change that is exactly 4 bars!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Indrek, now I can see that I was wrong and you're absolutely right!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Yes! Good night, guys!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I like this post so much but I'll have to address it tomorrow. It's my bedtime.

Good night all. Til tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Something about that color that keeps me coming back in...

Well..there's a time when I really feel it's just too much for me to read those candles and stay alert all the time for trading...

Maybe this one can be  my backup system that I can fire and forget while watching movie or doing another hobby...

I also found out that in M1 this system can be a real sport... Those color matching thing is good for refreshing and train my brain reaction. It's somehow fun. If I lose, I just simply put in another coin... with microlots of course. If I win I have a big smile like this... .

This system has some potential...

Will dig this deeper after doing regular trading.

Thanks Noel!!!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Bravo!  Bravo!  Not for me, but for all the guys who contributed and made this thread more educational.

I am very glad to see a lot of you are having fun with this.  I shall give more time this weekend and see what improvements from all the contributions.  The aim of course is still to make this work, as simple and as clean (charts) as possible.  Again, suggestion mostly welcome.  Hopefully, we can attach charts so it will help "visual" persons like me understand.

Let us determine the best entry (with less false signals).  I think the TP is better left to the trader, as I think I will stick to the exit as posted in Post #1.

I myself is having some difficulty in getting the best entry yet.  Or should I say having a hard time convincing myself to push that button when I should, and refrain from doing so when I shouldn't.  hehehe.

Again, as it warms my heart to see a lot of FF members appreciate this, let me say I am most happy to see a lot of better ideas being thrown in here, working around the PM Forex Strategy!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi,

if someone is interested in this version of 4BARS you can choose your favourite period of NonLagMA to display

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Roger on this... This one is really rock yesterday because market trend was defined clearly right after London and keep skyrocketing until Tokyo start...

But when the market range and flat, that would be the real challenge..

How bout you guys..?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I am sure your insights on how to overcome this challenge will be very valuable.

In the meantime, I always wait for your charts, coz you always seems to have a clear way of setting it up, and explaining it - entry, exit and most importantly WHY?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Great indy..... Anybody ??? What's the best setting ???

--- 帖子 #317 ---
EDIT:

I suggest 20, 80, 320, 1280.

The logics is 1*20, 4*20, 4*80, 4*320.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I am not good at this... That MTF color lied to me and take my pips away to some party without me.

I still do not have any clue without forcing people to look at candles. And if we begin to read candles,  I guess that would simply against the purpose of this thread, which is to find the most reliable, easy and cleanest way to trade with the given indicator.

I already tried to add this and that into this system. But still no clue to overcome the ranging and false breakout problem. I guess I am just not good with indicator and setting them. Honestly, I envy other people who does.

Using less or more indicator doesn't make us a good or bad trader.  Add whatever or lose whatever indi to your system. In fact, use robots, software, use other people to trade for us, rent signal or buy information or whatever else. Just do it.

Doesnt matter how many you have won or lose in your trading history. Trading is only about winning the next trade. Do whatever it takes.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Any trending system has the same problem with the ranging and flat market.

Even during the ranging/flat market if we follow the rules and exit at the right time (using semafor and Heiken Ashi) we still can make 20-30 pips here and there.

And if we make 200 pips when the market trends and the next day, when the market is flat, we make only 20-30 pips - I think it's OK, I can live with it!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I think I can live with that too! It's exciting, isn't it!

You guys are great.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I got even better idea: 5, 20, 80, 320.

In this case, we have two higher timeframes, plus one lower!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
sanyhuis, good for you!

And about 20-30 pips here and there:

For example, I DIDN'T enter EURUSD at 9:30 (at my chart I showed it as "BAD ENTRY"). It was the third candle, but the H-1 bar and M-15 bar on M-15 were different colors, so I didn't enter.

However, I decided to enter at 13:00, because at this time they were the same color. So I entered at 13:10, 1.2516

I decided to exit when I saw the semafor alert, at 1.2549.

So, I made 33 pips.

But EURUSD is still growing, I could make 80 pips (I should've check H-1 Heiken Ashi). But that's OK, I'm not complaining!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Yes... I can tell that you are good with this system.

As for me... It seems I just cant get the hang of it at the moment.

Can you tell me how many pips for SL you usualy use to trade in M15?

I dont manually trade anything else besides EU M5, I use 12 SL (sometimes 15), and I rarely got hit. But on M15 I think 12 is a bit too tight.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
NiceGuy, I use a very big SL, 50 pips. You see, I enter M-15, but if the semafor shows the alert on M-15 and on H-1 at the same time, then I go from M-15 to H-1, and H-1 demands much bigger SL. But if the currency turns against me and I can see it clearly (NonLagMA changes color), I exit manually with a small loss before SL got hit. So far with this system my big SL never got hit (but of course I trade this system a very short time)

And on the other hand, 50 pips is not such a big deal because when I go from M-15 to H-1, I usually get a lot of pips, 60-80-100 and more. I showed in this thread an example (110 pips NZDUSD), and when the market is trending, 100+ pips profit is not a big deal.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
With this system the stop loss is very small.

Here is another huge winner for today.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN! HE'S DONE IT AGAIN!

Is this system great or what?

P.S. Yesterday I said that GBPJPY and EURJPY were too risky, but on the second thought I think I'll try EURJPY. I still think that GBPJPY is too volatile, but I keep watching EURJPY and I think this system can handle EURJPY.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I appreciate it when you do this very much. What a help it is. NG's right. You are good. I adjusted the amount of indi's I have on chart. I like the minimum to do the proper job and if the minimum is too much then it's not the one for me. It's the only way for me to see what price is doing.

Game time. Netherlands/ Brazil. Sounds good!

Thanks guys for all.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I'm so glad because I have narrowed down to EU, P/U, and E/J.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Good decision! Yes, today is a very good and productive day!

P.S. And if Brazil wins - it will be a perfect day!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I think the system has very tight stops and huge wins.

This trade did not get to 100pips, but close........, not bad for a days trade !!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I can see that this is my problem. And this is where I envy you guys. I never feel comfortable putting 50 Pips as SL. My bankroll allowed me to do so. But somehow I always arguing myself in my head, "why should I risk more?" I usualy trade high contract for short term. I go below 0.5 lots if going for longer ones. In fact I  become nervous when my trades is going more than 1 hour. That's when I usualy go to sleep.

With this kind of trade, Alf is the way to go, but I ended up not exactly using it either lately. I use only basic RSI and Daily pivots for trading. Drawing lines here and there. You know that boring stuff.

This system is a whole new story to me. And I want to learn to trade longer and enjoy it while watching movie or do something fun like you guys.

Btw, I wonder if someone can write an EA that trigger a pips timer (once the semaphore signal kick in) to close the order. It's also not wise to sacrifice your bedtime too often, you know.... Mind your health.

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #332 ---
If you have time this weekend I recommend that you do some back testing on the stats.  Take all buy and sell trades and tally up your pips to see.  From my experience I notice that the stops are very tight...., not 50 pips.  When you buy for example when all four bars are green see that you exit when any of the four bars changes color.  Let us do the stats for this and see.  I like putting an emergency stop of 12 to 15 pips.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
The indicator is repainting. I would never imagined that until I saw it with my own eyes. It repainted repeatedly three previous bars before current...

Something wrong with the code, I guess. Unfortunately, I am not a coder, so cannot put the diagnosis.

P.S. Can someone with coding abilities take a look at it? It is, in principle, much better than the usual one with preset timeframes. Just the repainting should be eliminated.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Here is an example of a loosing trade.  Losed 15pips, stop loss got hit.

Ducke, right now I use:

NonLagMA_v7.1 (length 21)

4BARS_MTF-NLMA 1.01  (length 21)

3_Level_ZZ_Semafor_Alert - it is not the part of iamnoel' system, I use it for the exit; periods: 0; 0; 18)

Heiken Ashi - it is not the part of iamnoel' system, I use it for the exit.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Yes, it was a great game!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Just an idea... to minimize false signals...

Using NLMA 21 as a channel & the SMA 20....

Take a look at the crossing of NLMA 21 with SMA 20....

Just my 2 cts...

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #346 ---
NiceGuy, I agree with maxwell-eqtn, it is a very good way to change your point of view.

And I agree that the stops are very tight and 15 pips could be enough. I just put 50 pips in order to have more control, but if the currency turns against me, I usually manage to get out with a very small loss, sometimes even with a small profit.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
However I think Indrek is right and I'd better use NonLagMA 20 and NonLagMA 80 instead of MTF.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi Syahim

You really have the best looking charts!

:-)

I am just getting up to speed on this stuff.......I am quite capable of creating my own template....but I would most appreciate it if you could post your template. (no need to post the indicators....I have those)....it looks like you are using heinken ashi?

Thanks!

PGPB

...by the way, I pretty much trade with out indicators....mostly deciding first on direction and then moving down to the lower time frames to enter off of S&R and pivots....but this system does look rather appealing....it is reminisent (sorry for the spelling) of the MTF Trix thread

--- 帖子 #349 ---
When I traded GBPJPY, EURJPY and GBPUSD, I tested different settings for several weeks... I had to, otherwise GBPJPY would kick my behind!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
No problemo...

Here you go....

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Indrek, semafor is based on the ZigZag, so if the ZigZag "thinks" that it is the highest point right now, the "light" appears at the current candle right now. You can see the circle and you also get a popup alert. If after that, at one of the next candles, the price goes higher, the "light" moves to the next candle etc. So it repaints really badly, but I don't care, it is not important to me. For me is important that I received the signal: in a little while the trend is going to change. After that I don't even look at the semafor itself, I look at Heiken Ashi, and when Heiken Ashi gets smaller, I exit. So it is a two step operation: first a semafor alert, then watching Heiken Ashi.

I've no idea actually....... Have you put all the indy inside the indicator folder ? ie : program files/mt4 broker/experts/indicator folder....

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I cannot see the cross...what is the third line on your chart?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
It's the NLMA20 channel crossing with SMA 20...

Here you can see that both channels crossing each other..... NLMA20 channel and SMA 20 channel....

You buy or sell when both channels cross each other...

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Please, I need your help.

I´v loaded all Indi´s and tpl. from syahmi, (here thanks for all your effort), but unfortunately the bars don´t appear. Timeframes is showing but not the bars. I reloaded again and again, I´ve tryed with another broker, but nothing works.

What can I do? Has someone an idea !!???

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Fok,

So what would you do, use these two  in place of or in addition to 21 & 84?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I would suggest that you download them again and try installing the new ones.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Sorry guys... pls go back to my previous post #351..... and download the new template.... hope it helps....

Let me know if it's ok....

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I'm used to 140p SL, not trading on Fridays, and not usiing any indi's except for 2 sma's for trend. So when you guys came in today with 15-50 SL's and great Friday trading, it gave me much to think about.

Fok, when you talk about using the 20 & 80 are you using them with 21 and 84? and doing away with the bars?

Thanks for all the chart work you do.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
sanyhuis, I have to think it over, but I'll probably use:

NonLagMA 20

NonLagMA 80

NonLagDot 320

MTF (20)

I think 20 and 21 are very similar, so I don't need both 20 and 21. The same thing with 80 and 84.

I'll try to change the MTF settings so that on M-15 there will be no M-30 bar, just M-15, H-1, H-4, D-1

I'm going to keep MTF not because I need the bars (with NonLagMAs and NonLagDot I don't need bars), but because of the arrows, they are pretty good.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
A very good way to calculate SL value is 1.5*ATR or 2*ATR of current timeframe (the timeframe that you are trading from).

This way you will have SL related to the volatility of the currency pair.

So, when trading EU from M15 chart, the SL would be 20-25 pips. For H4 trades use 90-120. Etc.

Of course, you may always use last swing high/low if it is not too close or too far away from the entry.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Indrek, you are right, for me the real thing will be NonLagMA 20 and NonLagMA 80, I'm going to keep MTF just in case: if I got absent-minded and don't see NonLagMA's signal, then the arrow signal would help.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I LIKE IT A LOT!

--- 帖子 #369 ---
How bout M5 instead D1. I think it's good enough if you got H4 behind you back. M5 can give you signs of trouble befor it happened in M15.

I used to trade the hard way. Try reading candles, drawing lines, divergence...etc. I did pretty good with it. So when this system is came along, my head keep debating myself with "It can not be this easy" question. Well, after putting the MTF with the arrow.....It certainly looks  "It is that easy".

Thanks guys!!!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi, thank you for sharing this.  Can you kindly explain the semafor indicator, and how you used it as exit?  I plan to update Post #1 and semafor seems like a welcome addition, together with Indrek's MTF-MP-NLMA indicator - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=314

Your semafor indicator and setting is here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3831874, right?  How did you set it so that only #3 appeared?  It is only one you used?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Nice, nice.  We'd appreciate it much if you can share the settings you used.   Much like what F did here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=366

Of course, throwing in the charts again, when/where you enter/exit is definitely great!

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=351

Thanks for the info.  Can you share the settings as well.  Specially the "channels" - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=360

Also, for the HA, are you using the default settings?

Way to go!

--- 帖子 #373 ---
This indicator was not posted by me originally. And it repaints very badly, so I would not suggest to use it until some coder fixes its problems. Hope, someone can do it because the idea behind the indicator is brilliant.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Oh, sorry, my mistake.  It was posted by gspe.  Thank you for pointing that.

I think this one is for different PERIODS of NonLagMA and not for different timeframes right?

@Indrek, what MTF bars do you use in your charts here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=308

What is your settings please?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I will take the 20-30 anytime, anyday!!

How do you use the Heiken Ashi?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Currently, how can we change the TF of m30 to another one?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Quite right, and I like the idea very much. It should be far better than to have different timeframes because we can use proper correlation factor.

It is version 1.01 and I always use period 20 for nonlagMA.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
If using MAs instead of bars you can choose any timeframe. If current for m15 is period 20, then m30 is 40, hourly is 80, h4 is 320, daily is 1920 etc.

You can even use weird timeframes. For example, period 50 would mean 37.5 minute TF

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi,

if you need it just ask me, and i'll change the code for the 4BARS-MTF.

We can make it in any way we want, we can choose every time frame we like.

The only problem is the setup for arrow alert. Actually the indicator look from same color dots from lower time frame to higher for arrow and if it found 2- 3- or 4 dots of same color it display the arrow.

Please let me know what you think

gspe

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Sorry, it doesn´t work. I´ve loaded all from #351 but I can´t see the bars from NLM-MTF-4.

Now I see a .log file in my experts/indicator folder next to NLM-MTF-4 folder with the following message:

"1;39;;;Function "TimeFrameToString" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file"

Can someone to do something and help me ??

Thanks in advance!!!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Channel settings = 2,20 & 3,20

For HA = default settings

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Could you also fix the 1.00 version so that it would not repaint, please?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Sorry guy.... I don't know what to suggest anymore...

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi,

the only way that the 4BARS-MP repaint is that the NonLagMA repaints. I can try to look the code of NonLagMA_v7.1 or you could help me with a better version of NonLagMA that doesn't repaint.

gspe

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi,

you have to put all indicators in only  ./experts/indicators not in a sub-folder

gspe

--- 帖子 #386 ---
NonLagMA_v7.1 does not repaint if "Color Bar Back" is set to 0. I just found out that the default setting is 1 not 0. So, if I change it to 0 in the code, may this fix the problem?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi,

i've added the "Color Bar Back" parameter to both MTF indicators.

Hope this helps...

Please let me know

gspe

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Fok,

Please, what MTF are you using?

Thank you.

s

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thanks a lot!

We will see the result on Monday.

One thing that I already noticed after attaching the MP 1.01 to my charts - it takes less CPU than the previous version. Or is it just my imagination

--- 帖子 #390 ---
sanyhuis, I was using 4BARS_MTF-NLMA 1.01 (length 21)

But now I see that gspe made some changes, so we all have to download MTF from this post:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=388

Ladies and guys, if the repainting has been fixed - it is a big deal, so I would suggest to take our time and check it really good.

iamnoel, I need some time to find the posts where I explained my exit strategy, of course I could explain everything again, but these posts contain pictures that illustrate the strategy pretty good.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
NiceGuy, it is a very interesting idea! I have to think it over!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
iamnoel, here are the posts where I explained my exit strategy (using the semafor and Heiken Ashi) and answered the questions:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=125
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=127
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=129

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=344
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=352

You're right, my semagor and the settings are in this post:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3831874

The semafor has three different periods, Period1, Period2 and Period3. So, when I set Period1 to 0, #1 doesn't appear (because of the zero-setting), the same thing with #2 and Period2. So, with the settings 0, 0, 18 we can see only #3. You're right, I use only #3.

#1 and #2 are too "sensitive", but #3 shows the big picture.

My Heiken Ashi uses the default settings.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
How do you use 80 and 320 as filter?

What if one conflicts with the other 2?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Guys, I'm very glad that iamnoel decided to update the first post.

Hopefully with our help iamnoel will be able to create the whole new version of the strategy including all the details, new MTF indicators, exit strategy etc.

I saw some forexfactory's topic-starters created PDF-books that explain their strategies and put this PDF into the first posts.

It would be great if somebody could do the same for our strategy and our thread.

I would do it myself, but unfortunately I'm very bad with Adobe Acrobat. But this PDF would make our thread even more popular, it would bring more new people and they would share new ideas how to make the strategy even better, so everybody would win.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
iamnoel, I'm just planning to use it. If the new MTF doesn't repaint, I'll probably rather use MTF.

But I see it like this:

If 20 and 80 are the same color - it is a good entry, I would enter even if 320 is different color. But I would enter with a usual lot size.

But if all three (20, 80 and 320) are the same color - it is A VERY GOOD entry, and I would probably go with the bigger lot size.

And if 20 and 320 are the same color but 80 is different color - I wouldn't enter, the 20-80 relationship is more important!

--- 帖子 #396 ---
If the MTF indicator is working properly now, I prefer settings 5, 20, 80, 320. Then I see also the "lower timeframe" that is equal to 3.75 minutes if trading from M15.

Another option is to use 7, 21, 84, 336. In this case, the first one goes for M5 timeframe.

When trading with the other MTF indicator that shows timeframes, I would suggest to consider taking also the trades where M15, M30 and H4 match. So, any 3-block combination is good, either M15-H1-H4 or M15-M30-H4.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I was wrong, I can't do it with MTF, can be done with NonLagMAs only.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
It is a very good idea! Thank you, Indrek!

--- 帖子 #399 ---
So, Fok, what would you consider a usual lot and a bigger lot?

Thank you.

s

--- 帖子 #400 ---
sanyhuis, it depends on trader's MM preferences. It also depends on the quantity of pairs we decided to trade.

I'm going to demo this system for a while and during demoing I'm also going to choose the lot size. But right now I see it this way:

Let's say we created a demo account $3,000.00 and we're going to trade 4 pairs. My SL 50 and I don't want to risk more than 3% of the capital.

3% of $3,000.00 is equal $90.00

We have 4 pairs, so for one pair it would be $90.00 / 4 = $22.50

If $22.50 is equal my 50 pips' SL, then one pip is equal $0.45

That means that the usual lot size should be 0.045. But since the minimal lot size is 0.01 (not 0.001), we have to change this 0.045 into 0.05.

So, my usual size for $3,000.00 is 0.05, SL 50 and I trade 4 pairs.

That means that if all four pairs hit stop-loss at the same time:

4*50*10*0.05=100, I would lose $100.00, and it is 3.33% of my capital ($3,000.00)

But, if I see that the entry conditions are not just good, but perfect (all four dots aligned, or 20, 80 and 320 are the same color etc.), then I would risk not 3.33%, but 6%.

That would mean:

(0.05*6)/3.33= 0.09

So, with $3,000.00 and SL 50 , if I'm willing to risk between 3% and 6%, my usual lot size would be 0.05 and the bigger lot size would be 0.09

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Thank you, sir, for your answer. A great explanation.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
sanyhuis, probably more experienced traders will explain their MM systems too (that would be great), but I'm glad that I could help.

But please don't call me "sir". When somebody calls me "sir", I usually start looking around: "are they talking to me or to my grandfather?"

GSPE (or anyone who knows)

What is the difference between

4BARS-MP-NLMA

and

4BARS-MTF-NLMA

I know MTF stands for mutli time frame

I know that NLMA stands for non lag moving average

....both indi's seem to be multi time frame....what does MP stand for?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
MP (Multi-Period) works on MA periods while MTF is based on different timeframes.

MP is more objective if it does not repaint, of course.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Updated Post #1:

1.  Moved the following non-trading related indicators here - CANDLE TIME and MARKET PRICE.  Also added the TRENDLINES1 indicator as uploaded by Syahmi.

2.  Added the latest MP (multi-period) and MTF (multi time frame) NLMA indicator, as uploaded by gspe - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3848753

3.  New PMforex template was uploaded.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thank you.  Guess I need to read more on Heiken Ashi.

For semafor, more practice, esp on the psychology needed.  Let me try to see if I do get it.

If semafor appeared on m15, check if it appeared on H1 too?  If it does, most probably, the PA will continue moving IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  If it appeared only on m15, maybe it will reverse.  Am I even close?  hehehe

http://i49.tinypic.com/25k7jap.gif

when an alert occurs on a previously closed bar, on the NEXT bar is it  possible for a EA to put in a buy limit at a middle of what previous bar was?

example: GB 1H bar open at 1.5010 and closed at highest point of 1.5090; range of 80pips, is it possible for an EA to do a calculation and put in buy limit @ at 1.5050?

But if previous bar with an alert closed below or at mid-bar then the EA  can open market order.

can It be done?

because I think it would be a great idea to add that to the

EA EllisEdi is working on: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3835215

Thanks

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I do not think that it is good to have both MP and MTF on the chart. It would mean just overloading the chart with indicators that show basically the same. Quite confusing, and makes the terminal very slow if many charts open.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Can you explain the logics behind it? Why do you expect price going to the same direction if h1 new high/low has been also set?

And when you see semafor on both m15 and h1, do you then go to h4 to see if it also has a semafor?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Indrek, I can't explain the logics, but I've seen that hundreds of times: when we see the alert on M-15 only, usually that's it, but when we see it on both M-15 and H-1 - usually price keeps going in the same direction. So for me it is not about the logics, it is about the statistics.

I never go to H-4 (H-4 is too big for me), I work only on M-15 and H-1. I think M-15/H-1/H-4 would work the same way, but we probably need different semafor settings for H-4.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I agree.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
entry : when all the 4 bars have same color, take position immediately. sometimes its better to wait for one more candle for confirmation, especially when market is range bound

sl : this is not clear so far. someone mentioned 1.5 ATR, someone else mentioned recent swing hi/lo. others have mentioned 15 pips.

tp : when atleast one bar changes color. or when we see 3 consiquitive bars with higher/lower close.

this week we will get clear picturie on some of these issues. meanwhile if someone wites EA, we can test will various combinations

now i am getting clearer and clearer on this strategy.

M15 is the lowest TF that could work well. may be M5 too. but i doubt it works well for H1-H4-D1-W1 unless we have a strong trending market

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Updated Post #1

As per suggestion, to avoid CPU overload, you can delete one of  the MP or MTF indicator.

Btw, what do you think is better, the MPnlma or the MTFnlma?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that on M-15 sometimes MTF's signals are faster than MP's signals.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Logically, MP should be better because it always shows the current situation. If it is not repainting, of course.

Backtesting can be done only with MP and not MTF, for reasons that we already talked about earlier.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
That's what I notice too, but repainting seems to be a problem still?  Or was it just my imagination... still testing ....

--- 帖子 #419 ---
So far I haven't seen any MP repainting.

Maybe it is different on different timeframes and with different settings?

I'm watching EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURJPY and (just out of curiosity) GBPJPY on M-15.

And I changed the MP settings: 21, 42, 84, 168.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Indrek said:

After that gspe created a new MP indicator.

But as far as I know, this MP indicator also has "Color Bar Back", and it's default setting is also 1.

So, I changed the "Color Bar Back" setting in my MP from 1 to 0.

iamnoel, what is your MP "Color Bar Back" setting right now?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
We have to forward test the indicator now. "Color Bar Back" is a good choice but the previous version repainted even 5 last bars not one... Let us see.

Hi Fokusnik!

Do yo have anything similar to the Semaphore?

I found out that the Semaphore signal (circle with number 3 on it) is way too big, I have difficulty to see the candle behind it...

--- 帖子 #424 ---
i am using 4BARS-MTF-LNMA-1.03 indicator and its repainting on all pairs. i dont have MP in my template, just MTF. i havent seen this issue with previous versions of MTF

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Confirmed on this one too....

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi,

it's just normal for an MTF indicator, because we don't know the future so if you put the MTF indicator on a M15 it repaint 2 bars for M30, 4 bars for H1 and 8 bars for H4, and so on if you put it on other time frame

gspe

--- 帖子 #427 ---
NiceGuy, you can make the circle smaller. Go to the setting, to "Colors". In the "Colors" the setting "Width" has 5 options, from 1 to 5. Make it 1.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Now, you can clearly see how awful my skill is with indicators.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Cool!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I would suggest to use MP or MTF as an alert tool only. I mean: when we see a good alingment on M-15, go to M-30 and H-1 and look at NonLagMA itself. Of course, the last part of the NonLagMA on M-30 and H-1 can repaint. BUT if the previous part of it is the right color and the current part of it is the right color, then there is a good chance that it won't repaint.

And if only last part of it is the right color, we'd better wait the end of the candle formation.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Agreed ! It should only be used as an alert tool. Period...

--- 帖子 #432 ---
And, of course, we can do it the other way.

Let's say, we are on H-1 and we see, that H-1 NonLagMA's color changed: it used to be green, but during the last hour it became red, and at the beginning of the new hour it is still red.

Then go to M-15. If NonLagMA's color is already red and if it seems that it would stay this way - then enter short immediately. If NonLagMA's color on M-15 is green - then wait until it becomes red and stays red, and after that make sure that H-1 is still red. If it is - enter short.

Just my two cents...

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Is it possible to recode the alerts so that the popup message would say what timeframe it comes from?

I trade EURUSD and EURJPY and for both I have four charts open - m15, m30, h1, h4. Would be nice to read the timeframe from the message at once

--- 帖子 #434 ---
thanks gspe for the explanation. now i understood.

i think it makes sense to wait for one more bar to close before we take the trade. lets we are in green (all TF). M15 changes to red. wait. next bar also puts red in M15 and all others are also still red, then jump in. we might be late in some instances but will save the whips in ranged market

I was just reading through this thread from the beginning and when I read your idea of trading the cross of the 21 and 84 the first thing that came to mind to be taken into consideration was the angle of the 84 at the time of the cross. Very simply, the trade will have a much better chance of working out positively if the angle (direction) of the 84 is the same as the direction of a cross from below to above or from above to below.

Hello everyone,

I discovered this thread this past weekend and stayed up last night reading through all 30 pages of it.

Today I am trying to download, upload, install all the indicators from post #1 and having not even the least bit of success

whatsoever. I can't get anything into any metetader platform and I can't even begin to figure out why.

I am attaching what I am seeing when I try to load into metatrader and it just doesn't look right at all. Why does it just say

"attachment"? That strikes me as strange. Also, I am inclined to question this being a PHP file as a possible cause to problems.

This "PHP" strikes me as strange also.

Does anyone have any ideas that will help me get going?

Thanks,

Mike

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Some browsers download as "attachment" so you have to rename the file.  A better solution id to try to download the files from under the paperclip in top right corner of thread page,  then you should be able to place them in appropriate folder.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hmmm... my best guess at the moment would be that your explanation of different browsers downloading as "attachment" would

be wrong because I have hunted back through the actually threads to find some of the original posts and the original files and some

say of the ones that said attachment from the updates in post #1 come up with the full file name and not attachment... so I am thinking

that that would dispell your theory. (sounds more to me like a problem on the end of the posts... why do some of them come up as

"attachment" and some don't?) ???

I will try downloading from the paper clip in the upper right corner.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Strange, I see .mq4 and .ex4 in Post #1

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Did that work (downloading from the paperclip?)

If not, save the file, to your desktop, and change where it says save as .php to save as "all files"...when you are saving it....rename it to the name you want, saving it to your desktop....and then drop it into your template files.

In almost every thread I read, somewhere along the thread someone has this trouble.

downloading from the paperclip usually works....and if not....just name the file to the proper name and extension......a bit of a hassle, but it works

I think we should discuss the setup differences for different timeframes.

I think that on M-5 we'd better wait for 4 dots' alingment, on M-15 3 dots alignment is good enough, and on H-1 I would enter with just 2 dots' alignment.

What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Are you using this new setup Foks.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
stifland, I didn't trade this yet, as a matter of fact I didn't trade Monday and Tuesday at all because of the 4th of July.

But I think starting now I'm going to use this setup for a little while, on the history it looks good...

when you see 3 dots allignment is ok, those 3 are the most recent ones ? for M15, it could be M15, M30, H1. is that true ?  we cant take trade if the current TF is against all remaining 3 TF

i am still confused about when the dots are changing and how it is repainting and when the arrow is drwan, whether arrow is also redrawn ?

also about SL, TP, not sure what startegy to follow

--- 帖子 #453 ---
yeah.  looks OK but I gots no dots in indis. downloaded latest

Since the original trade strategy requires exiting the trade on two lower highs for a buy or two higher lows for a sell, or if the NonLagMA changes color, I would think that the pip distance of the two candles before entry would be a good measure to consider for a stop. If this happens to be a large number of pips, say anything more than 18, then I would use half of that amount because if price moves against your position by more than half the amount of pips that the first two candles make up, the NoNLagMA will probably change color anyway.

Using both MTF & MP at the same time.... Luckily it's not using much CPU resources.

Check the vertical red line drawn earlier. NLMA yellow channel is very useful to detect trend change and movement.

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #457 ---
stifland, I don't know what went wrong. My MTF works just fine.

But I can tell you, that I never downloaded the latest version. I use 4BARS-MTF-NLMA 1.03.mq4 from this post:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3848753

And I think using both MTF and MP at the same time uses too much CPU resources.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Excuse me, Is entry in the candle distinguished by the vertical line or in the following candle?

Ducke

--- 帖子 #459 ---
roundrock, what I'm talking about - is not an official iamnoel's version, just my views, OK?

Let's take M-15 for example. Let's say your MTF shows 3 dots' alignment for the first time, and it shows it right now. I'm talking about the three bottom bars on M-15: M-15, M-30 and H-1, I don't care about the top dot (H-4's dot).

I don't want to enter immediately, because M-15's dot (the bottom dot) can repaint before the end of the current candle. I wait for the end of the candle and then, if the new 3 dots are still aligned - then it is the signal that we can enter. So, we enter not at the current candle that shows 3 dots, but at the beginning of the next candle.

But I also said before (and Syahmi supported me) that we'd better use MTF or MP as an alert tool only. So, if MTF at the beginning of the next candle shows 3 dots, we go to M-30 and H-1 and check the NonLagMA itself there - I already explained how to do it in this post:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=431

I'm not sure whether arrows repaint or not. Frankly speaking, it doesn't matter, because for me MTF is just an alert tool, I go to M-30 and H-1 and look at NonLagMA for the confirmation.

And about SL and TP - it really depends on your MM preferences.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
3 bars alignment for MTF and 2 bars alignment for MP are good enough to me for an entry...

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Fok,

For me.... when I get an arrow, green or red... I'll check the NLMA channel.. whether the channel is uptrending/downtrending and if the price is above the upper channel for an uptrend or the price is below the lower channel for a downtrend.... then only I'll take a trade....

My Rules :

1. Get signals... Green or Red arrows

2. Check NLMA channel.... Uptrending or Downtrending

3. Price must be above the upper uptrending channel or below the lower downtrending channel

4. Take a trade or open position

The chart below is an example..... Take a look at both red vertical line....  Red arrows appeared.... NLMA channel is downtrending.... Price below the lower downtrending channel....

P/S: If the NLMA channel is flat or moving sideways..... it's a NO TRADE ZONE.

Just my 2 cts...

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thank you, Syahmi, it is a very good explanation!

I'm sure that everything we discuss here will help iamnoel to create a final version of his strategy.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
What indicator are you using for the NLMA channel.

And what are the settings.

Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Indicator ???  Pls refer to front page... post #1

Channel settings = 2,20 & 3,20 (or 2,26 & 3,26)

For HA = default settings

--- 帖子 #465 ---
hello guys.  Would like to ask those who have backtested this system, about the NonlagMA, what is the best setting?

is it 7?
21?
84?
336?

thanks

--- 帖子 #466 ---
thanks Syahmi, Fokusnik for the great explanation.

now its getting clearer... need some practice though

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Friends, do not add more and more indicators, especially MAs and MA based stuff (channels etc) to the setup.

Remember that all MAs show basically the same thing. In fact, that is the reason why I do not use Heiken Ashi - it is nothing more than a version of MA.

When trading with nonlagMA, we already have a representative of MA family on our charts. Why do we need more instead of picking up sth different?

If the discretion is not enough for taking decisions then use RSI or CCI  for confirmation.

One suggestion for picking up entries: if trading m15 charts, do not trade when there is no volatility in the market. The volatility can be easily estimated by using two ATRs - a shorter one and a longer one. For example, put ATR6 and ATR36 on each other. If ATR6 line is above then there is a good volatility, if ATR36 is above - no trade.

It works best when using ATR of m5 timeframe. Attached is a MTF ATR indicator that allows to see ATR of m5 on any higher TF chart.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Heiken Ashi IS NOT a version of MA.... PERIOD. The trend was very  clear,  leaving no room for guessing. Heikin-ashi  charts are modified candlesticks.

This  technique  apparently has been developed by a Japanese trader who made a fortune  using it  and until then was used only by Japanese traders.

Heikin-ashi  is a visual  instrument to assess trends, their direction, and strength.  It is not the Holy  Grail of trading, but  a great and simple tool to visualize the trend.  It is  strongly recommended to combine it with technical indicators,  patterns, and  other trading techniques. The results will improve significantly.

Do some reading folks....

P/S : With this note... I will end my useless part on this thread.... We're just throwing ideas here... not to teach other people to do this and that.... If they want to consume, let it be.... I don't like to see people with just 1-3 yrs experience trying to teach other people on how to walk and run...

So, good bye folks..... sorry to bother you guys here... I wont do that again...

Thread owner... if you can.... kindly pls delete all my postings here... TQ.

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #469 ---
These were just my suggestions, and I cannot see why you reacted so angrily. If you like to trade from messy charts, that is ok with me. I do not, and I do not suggest it for beginners. Why cannot I say so?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Do not I see why anybody should take offence with the suggestions of another person? Only I hope that the pride is not major that the reason.

Fok,

What pairs will you be looking at this afternoon?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
sanyhuis, I decided that I'm going to try GBPJPY too. So, I'll be watching four pairs: EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Good show. I really need some practice. I've not done well with it lately and I think I have too much on the chart and I can't see the forest for the trees. Or vice versa. Which is it!?!

Anyway, thanks.

During the last two days I got 3 PMs asking for my current template, so I think I'd better post it here.

NonLagMAv7.1 is not on the chart, but you have to have it in your folder, otherwise MTF won't work properly.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Thank you. I wanted to ask but hadn't gotten it done yet. When it was so quiet on the thread for 11 hours, I thought it was over! I'm so glad to see everyone today!

Now to find loosingtrades......

s

--- 帖子 #476 ---
sanyhuis, I agree with Indrek, the simpler - the better. I'm sure all we need for a good entry - NonLagMA. MTF (or MP) is just a visual help, an alert tool, it is the same NonLagMA.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I decided not to trade on Monday and Tuesday because of the 4th of July. I thought the Market was going to be too slow after the Holiday. And on Monday American banks were closed anyway - since the 4-th of July was on Sunday, they observed it on Monday.

I think a lot of us decided not to trade these two days, it would explain why the thread was so quiet.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
What did you do with HA? ON the template? ( I haven't downloaded yet)

--- 帖子 #479 ---
thanks Fokusnik, i have downloaded all these files, i am seeing just a candle stock chart, i dont see any of nonMa stuff...

can you post the screenshot ?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I remember what Fokusnik said the other day about a relation between EU-EJ-UJ and GBP-GBY-UJ.

Well actually that was a good filter indeed.

Only trade EJ when EU-UJ lines up, and only trade GBY if GBP and UJ lines up. Otherwise no trade.

I am in the beginning of learning EJ pairs after only trade EU for couple of years back. I just being amazed how EJ jumped or dropped fast when EU-UJ is moving to the same direction.

Just tile any group of these three on your chart. You'll see what I mean. Just make a simple USD 100 in 1 lots trade because of this.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I keep Heiken Ashi on a different chart and use it for exit only.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
NiceGuy,

What is your qualifier when you say "they line up"?  In which timeframe?

Having tough day today ...

--- 帖子 #483 ---
roundrock, it is very strange! Please make sure that you restarted Metatrader.

It is supposed to look like my picture:

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Oh, I hope you can reconsider.  You've been a big help in this thread.  I am sure everybody mean well here.

Btw, how do you set up your NLMA channel?  Looks interesting.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
NiceGuy, you're right!

I never trade USDJPY, but even if I trade only 4 pairs, I have 5 charts (including USDJPY)!

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Fok, I notice you are using only the 21. What happened to 84?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
sanyhuis, instead of having 84 on my M-15 chart I just go to H-1 and look at H-1's NonLagMA (21). It is as reliable as 84 and this way my chart is cleaner.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
i have restarted MT4 several times, i have checked again and all the indicators are in indicator folder and template in template folder

--- 帖子 #489 ---
roundrock, I'm sorry, I don't know how to fix this problem. All my indicators are from forexfactory, I'm not sure what could cause the problem. Maybe somebody else could help.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Indrek, thank you very much! It sounds very interesting!

--- 帖子 #491 ---
in the template code, i saw symbol=EURJPY, and no other symbol. so i tried this template with EURJPY, now i can see arrows but nothing else

--- 帖子 #492 ---
In this case I post a picture to illustrate how I use it. I have ATR 6 and ATR 1440. This means that I compare the average range of m5 bars during last 30 minutes to the range of m5 bars during last 5 days.

If green line is above - trade. If red above - no trade.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
roundrock, I didn't have any idea that it is possible to open the template (I knew that it is possible with mq4 files).

I don't think that EURJPY means anything, probably I created this template using EURJPY's chart.

Maybe the template got screwed up during the upload. Could you try again?

As far as understand sanyhuis got the same template just fine...

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Look at this chart.. I know you will love it.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am focusing at EJ M5 for the moment.

Yes, I am supposed to open position only when MTF has the same color. But The MTF Indi lied to me many time. I broke the rules again... sorry. I just have to find  out how to play this MTF properly...

See how the three signal form MTF appeared almost at the same time on three charts. I dont take the trade directly when the arrow appeared on EJ because the candle color is different.

I opened position 2 candles from NY open because that's when I see EU and UJ is rapidly moving down. Closed with 10 pips TP. I have not yet get used to ride the candles like you guys (which is turn out to be the right decision in this example).

I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Cool!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Guys, I still think that watching several different pairs is a good idea. Just look at today's AUDUSD and NZDUSD!

So starting tomorrow I'm gonna watch 6 pairs:

EURUSD

GBPUSD

AUDUSD

NZDUSD

GBPJPY

EURJPY

I will also have USDJPY chart.

So, when EURUSD and USDJPY go in the same direction, I'll trade EURJPY.

When GBPUSD and USDJPY go in the same direction, I'll trade GBPJPY.

And I'll trade EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD and NZDUSD every time I see a good alingment.

With such a broad choice I'll probably find some good trades under any circumstances.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
wow, finally its working fine with this attachment. thanks again Fokusnik

--- 帖子 #498 ---
roundrock, that's great!

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi,

just to simplify the chart. You don't need both NonLagMA.ex4 and NonLagMA_v7.1.mq4 they are just the same thing.

You have just to set Color to 1 in NonLagMA_v7.1.mq4 to have the same graphic

Come back, Syahmi!

Yes, I made these changes immediately!

P.S. We live and we learn!

When EU-UJ Aligned (moving to the same direction), hit EJ. Especially when the MTF signaling the arrow at the same time.

Another 20 pips is coming... Looks a bit shaky, so I decided 20 pips is enough. This is 1 lots contract.

Now I was wrong..should stay in a bit longer. Sick.. I hate when greed comes to play..

NiceGuy, how much help is your RSI indicator?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Not much, I guess.

I mainly use the RSI to spot a divergence and it doesnt have anything to do  with any rules in this strategy. Actually, I used to trade with Daily pivots and that RSI only. I'm just kind of get used to see it on my chart.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Thanks for the suggestions PGPB. They came in handy when I was downloading templates and indicators that our friend Fokusnik sent

to me.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Fokusnik, thank you for your indicators and templates and insights on all

your posts. They lead to great discussion and learning for everybody here.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
mike22, discussing here the issues we, the traders, can make this system even better!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
In one of my earlier posts I mentioned that Heikin Ashi belongs to MA family. After that one respected member accused me of not knowing that HA is not a version of MA.

So, I would like to clarify the matter.

1. What is MA? - It is the average of close, open, high, low, high+low, high+low+close prices of a number of bars.

2. What is Heikin Ashi? - It is calculated as: xClose = (Open+High+Low+Close)/4

o Average price of the  current bar xOpen = [xOpen(Previous Bar) + Close(Previous Bar)]/2

o  Midpoint of the previous bar xHigh = Max(High, xOpen, xClose)

o Highest value in the  set xLow = Min(Low, xOpen, xClose)

o Lowest value in the  set So, it is not needed to have a Doctor degree in math nor 50+ years of trading experience to identify that MA and HA are very close relatives, i.e  they belong to the same family.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Ouch, first you hurt her feelings when you knocked her down (figuratively), now you kick her when shes down.

Indrek, how about taking this approach, if it works for her then great, she should use it, just the same way that if more indicators works for someone then so be it.... whatever works for any individual trader to make some positive pips.

There is an old saying that goes, "it is better to understand, than to be understood"

Live and let live.

I for one think that all of her posts were pretty much near brilliant and

tremendously informative.

I don't know much about HA but if it can show the end of a trend, which seems how she uses it,

any quicker than a moving average than why not use it?  We all know how long it takes moving

averages to roll over because a trand has changed direction.

then why not use.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Oh, I just wanted to clarify what is Heikin Ashi. To become successful, it is important to have truthful information. That  is what I tried to provide in my previous post.

I never meant to offend Syahmi, and I never had anything against her. She has her own way of trading and I have mine. Both have full right to express our ideas.

It is not about feelings here. Trading is just a business, a tough one, by the way. You cannot expect that any professional trader reveals his system to any person, and certainly not in a public forum. Neither do I. But I am always ready to share ideas and certain elements that are necessary to build up a good system.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
"I for one think that all of her posts were pretty much near brilliant and

Thanks for your post, Mike.  It looks like we've lost a good member.

Anyone else trading long EU and EY right now? It may be a beginning of a longer trend. And of course, it may not

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Indrek, I want to use the ATR indicator you posted at #493.  Is the ATR6 the green line and the ATR 1440 the red one?  Do I leave "time frames" at zero?  Also, does it matter where in the indicator box the two lines are located, as long as the ATR6 is above the ATR1440 to enter a trade?  (Hope I don't have them reversed.)  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Leave so many flattery, who wants to go away, that him is OK. Only he takes offence, the one who wants to take offence. Let's do trading, where the prides are excluded.

I am trading in TF H1 with excellent results.

HA is really a great help. I give Thanks to Iamnoel for his strategy and to Fokusnick for his contributions.

Escuse me my English, I use Translator.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Timeframe 0 means current timeframe. If you want to use it for m5 ATR then the setting should be 5.

You are right, my green is 6 and red is 1440. It is just symbolic - green above means green light for trades

When you drag two ATR indicators to the same box then I suggest to fix equal minimal and maximal values for both. Then they are fixed towards each other when you scroll the chart back and forward.

When you open the settings, go to "General" tab. I attach a picture to show how I have set it for EU. For Yen pairs you have to use different values as there are only two decimal places.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Thanks, Indrek.  Another question:  On the longer period ATR indicator, for "periods" do I ener 36 or 1440?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I noticed in the chart you posted here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=493, you are in m15 timeframe, but you set up your MTF-ATR in 5m timeframe?

Am I right in this observation?  Any reason why?  I noticed GREEN (6) always seems to be on top of RED (1440) in GBPJPY pair with that kind of setup?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #518 ---
It is up to you. If you use 6 and 36 then you compare the volatility of last 30 minutes and 3 hours. If 6 and 1440 - last 30 minutes and last 5 days. Both work.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
The reason is that comparing the current ATR on m15 chart would be very much lagging as the market situation changes too quickly.

ATR6 on m15 means 6*15=90 minutes. It is too much, during that time the situation could change more than once.

And no - green is not always above with GY. You have to set the minimal and maximal value to see the lines properly.

Attached picture shows the current situation for GY - market just starting to move.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi, I am not sure what is wrong with my charts?

The RED (1440) is always on top of the GREEN (6)?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
it coulod help if Indrek can share his template....

i am also having issues with ATR

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Did you guys fix the equal minimal and maximal values as explained in post 516?

iamnoel, there is something totally wrong with your indicator settings. No ATR of m5 timeframe can reach 1.00 as it seems to be on your picture.

NB! Both ATRs should have EQUAL minimal and maximal value.

Attached is a sample tpl to show how ATR is set. Sorry, I cannot share my trading template.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
i have downloaded this template, i dont see the atr lines !!!  i have the indi #MTF_ATR in my indicator folder

--- 帖子 #524 ---
My template was made for EY. If you use it for EU then you have to adjust the indicator settings (minimum and maximum value) accordingly because EU has more decimal places.

Guys, I do not offend anyone, but my suggestion is to learn the tools (MT4 tools, indicators) before even thinking about trading some system. It can be done on your own - just play with indicators and see what happens, plus read available sources in internet. After some months you will be ready for next step - using some very simplified system like a MA crossover.

Here is a sample tpl for eu.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Whoa, I lost the ATR?!?

Here's my setting ... I used it in GBPJPY pair.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Set it to 0.05 and 0.2, for example. The ATR of GY is often more than 0.1, so you have just hidden the lines

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Thanks, it worked!

Hello everybody

I'd like to share my variation on the PM Forex Strategy, maybe someone will be intrested.

I use it on m5.

Trades are not opened at the open of third candle but when the price goes back to sma5, so it can happen at the third candle or later.

Long setup - NonLagMA in green, sma5 above NonLagMA.

Short setup - NonLagMA in red, sma5 under NonLagMA.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Edzwin,

Sure...I think many would be interested in your strategy, including myself. Are you simply using a retrace to the SMA5 as a pullback to avoid a potential whipsaw, and then entering the trade whan price returns to the trend? Or is there more to it than than?

Have you compared this ploy to the default setup to determine if it is more profitable your way?

Thanks,

BC

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Edzwin... I took the liberty of using your picture to quickly illustrate how I make most of my best trades. What is great about this startegy is the that the trade usually goes positive immediately... which is really great for the trader's psyche. Also, you are getting in the trade earlier which allows you to use a tighter smaller stop loss.

As price goes up, draw a trend line going up underneath it. When price breaks the trend line, enter a sell trade.

As price goes down, follow it with a trend line down. When price breaks the trend line, exit your trade.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I always wait for a retrace to the sma5. When market is ranging it allows me to restrict losses and SL can be smaller. From my overview in most cases we get better entry position.

With drawing trendlines, there is always one problem for me, I see much more trendlines on this picture then you drew and most of them ends up with small pullback

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi, gspe.  Thank you for these great MTF indicators.

Is it possible in 4BARS-MTF-NLMA 1.03 to allow the user to specify the four timeframes to be used, so that timeframes lower and higher than the chart timeframe can be shown?

Many thanks, if you can do it ......

Edit:  Or, if that's too complicated, could you change it so that the two timeframes lower than the chart timeframe, and the next timeframe higher that the chart timeframe, will be shown?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I need some advice on getting the two 4Bar indis onto my charts.  Last week I succesfully loaded them into one of my practice accounts but today I have had no joy trying to get them onto one of the other accounts.  I have tried copying them from post 1, also from the attachments files and from the practice account where they are working.  They show up in the navigator but when I put them onto a chart no coloured squares appear.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I have now analyzed the behavior of MP and MTF version of the indicator to find out which is better.

My conclusion was:

1. MP is showing the real time situation that is valid during this candle and maybe after that. It is like trying to predict the future. We have more entries but also more false entries.

2. MTF is showing only the confirmed signals for higher timeframes. It means taking decisions on the basis of past information. We have less entries, which means avoiding more false ones but also missing some good ones.

The final comment is that MP is a tool for an aggressive and experienced trader and MTF should be preferred by a conservative one.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
interesting system.

i'm not sure how i'm supposed to backtest this ea?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Have you got NonLagMA_v7.1 in your .../experts/indicator folder?  (4Bar indis call this Indi.)

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Excellent, Indrek.

Very helpful to all of us.  Thank you for your time/effort in analysing these two Indicators.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
MTF gives me diffirent indications on the same time frame (m15), for example today since 7 o'clock on the first window I got 4 arrows down - 7.15, 8.00, 15.15, 17.15 (GMT + 2:00), on the second window I have 4 arrows (3 down, 1 up) - 8.00, 15.15, 16.00, 17.15, arrow from 15.15 dissapeared during 3 next candles, maybe someone knows, what's the cause?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
As it was discussed before, an MTF bar indicator, when used on m15 chart, can  change 1 bar of m15, two bars of m30, four bars of h1 and 16 bars of h4 in real time. Naturally, the arrows appear and disappear when it happens.

It has no meaning for trading but makes backtesting impossible. If you want to backtest, use MP.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I'm aware of that, but this doesn't explain why I have diffrent indications in separate windows, both with the same setup, for now I can point only one difference between them, MTF bar indicator in the first window is from template and h4 is at the bottom (m15, m30, h1, h4), MTF bar indicator from the second window isn't from template but h4 is at the top (h4, h1, m30, m15).

I backtested MTF bar indicator on History Training from 2.6.2010 to 12.7.2010 and I didn't notice any vanishing arrows so this must be very rare  phenomenon

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Check how many dots you have set for the arrow? If it is 3 then it means 3 from bottom. If one indicator is upside down then the arrows must not match.

It is up to you if h4 is above or m15.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
thanks for quick reply, you resolved my all doubts, cheers

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thanks for that DM3554.  I have installed the NonLag and now I have nice little coloured boxes in the 4Bar.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Seems like this thread is also dead. It often happens to the best threads like this one or Andrew Forex or ALF Revisited... Why most people are looking for some total mess full of indicators?

There is a thread in FF where a "guru" teaches people how to trade on the basis of PA only. And it is being done using 7 indicators  Sounds impossible but it is not, just crazy

No really good system that I have seen uses more than 3 indicators.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Yeah, so sad... anyways, whats the link of "guru"?

Is it good?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
It is sick. Maybe funny if you have a strange sense of humor

I cannot believe how some people buy such crap...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
In my opinion, there's some good stuff in this thread.  I'm having success with my interpretation of the concepts and indicators.

The NLMA-MTF-4... has some flaws, but the idea behind is solid (inho). It can sometimes give a signal too early and will not remove those arrows. You need to bring up the indicator in the indicator list, select Edit, and Ok without making any changes and it will repaint correctly. But, if ou are looking at the indicator itself you can tell when the false signal is occuring. I will have to go into the code to look further.

I find the signals on the M15 and H1 are very good. Stops are placed below previous high/low and exits are taken with the NonLag....  If looking at M15 exits come with M15 or M5 NonLag... changing direction. On H1, exits come with H1 or M15 NonLag.

Essentially, the NLMA-MTF-4... is telling you when the trend is in line across many timeframes. When this occurs you have momentum in your favor. You may not get in at the start of the move, which is also the riskiest time, but you are getting in when the odds are in your favor. And, with the NonLagMA.... you are exiting neer turning points.

I also look at the Pivot Points D, W, & M, the 200 EMAs, trendlines, and S/R in general. NLMA-MTF-4... signals coming around areas of confluence can be powerfull and merit a larger position. These areas can also give you better Stop level placement. The use of these levels is also one of the reasons why I don't think trying to totally automate (EA) this is worth the effort.

I try not to filter signals (guess which will be good or bad), but rather take all signals when I am watching the markets. The only exception is that going back historically, I find the majority of bad signals will come between 6pm and midnight EST. The NonLagMA... turning will get you out of most choppy situations long before your Stop.

I'm subscribed so I'll see if anyone is still open to exchanging ideas.

Hi everybody!

I don't think that the thread is dead, I'm sure people will read it six month from now or even a year from now.

As far as I understand the traders that have been active in this thread have found their own styles, created their own modifications, and it is a very good thing. However having this good thing the traders don't want to talk any more - they want to trade and make money! And it's natural!

They also don't want to waste their time arguing about the additional indicators. And they are right!

As for me: when I trade using MTF or MP as an alert tool - I get good, solid results (both M-15 and H-1, six currencies: EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY, AUDUSD, NZDUSD).

However, I don't trade this way very often any more.

Right now I'm trying to get rid of MTF and also change the settings, testing NonLagMA (9) or NonLagMA (14). In other words, I'm trying to make the system faster and more simple and reliable.

Of course, the tests take a lot of time, but I know: if I succeed with these tests - that's great, otherwise - I can always go back to NonLagMA (21) and MTF or MP.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Yes, it's getting cold around here....

I guess you guys must be too busy trading...

Well, I am still playing around with this stuff and try to arrange a good MM to work with this.

And you know what? When you get the hang of it, you can almost tell which one is the false signal from the right one. I am constanly risking small pips (20 pips max) in 15 TF and aim for ridiculously large TP. Many times, I could nail more than 50-100 pips with only risking 10 pips + Spread. Look for a signal just before London, Newyork, and the close of Europe and stick with high volatility pairs like GU, EJ, and GJ. You will see what I mean. I always put my SL at the back of the candles pointed by the arrows from MTF and I am looking for a small candles to enter. I think this system is great for risking ridiculously small to win ridiculously big kind of trading. We will have our loses but in the end we still making money from making the right entry less than 50% in long term. So keeping the SL closer and the TP far is the key here.

The only problem about this system is I think that MTF NonLag indicator is the one that causing the Lag  Especially when opened simultaneously with multi pairs. I am using a Quad Core and 8 Gb system...

I never trade multi pairs before. But I am on my way in educating myself to do so. I am hoping this system could be my way in.

I wonder what's wrong with the lag? I am no coder, and I hope one of you guys could look inside the code to see if there's a problem in it.

Thanks again to all!

Example of good trade....

GBPJPY - M15

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Some Advice:

1. Keep Low SL and Keep High TP!

2. Put the SL Behind the candle with the arrow, if our entry is right the price will leave the SL Alone.

3. Stay Away if the candle is too big or already moving too far away from THV Coral. Enter only with the candle your MM can afford.

4.  Look for entry just before London Open, NY Open or Europe Close. For JPY Cross, look entry during Toky but before Europe. This is where they ussualy changing direction.

5. If you can read divergence, that would be a plus!

Keep the entry candles small and close to THV Coral MA

--- 帖子 #554 ---
NiceGuy, thank you for sharing! I really appreciate it and I'll take a look at THV Coral MA and do some demo-testing.

I still like PM strategy, but I decided to find something even simpler, so for the last week I've been trading using just Heiken Ashi and the semafor. Heiken Ashi is amazing when you know how to use it!

So, I trade GBPJPY and EURJPY with just two indicators, Heiken Ashi and the semafor, and so far I'm very pleased with the results.

I also like a lot BBands stop:

Hi Fokusnik!

Glad you can do well out there..

I still playing around with this PM just to figure out how to trade well with this one. It turns out well...

The Idea of this small candles entry is to risk small and win big.

For example:

Take 10 trades with risking 20 (or lesser) pips SL consistently and aim for 50 (or even bigger pips ). The worst case scenario happened If you lose 7 trades you lose 140 pips, but you will also win 3 trades earning 150 pips. There is still 10 pips in our bank...

See how 30% right will earn you money. If you can not make 30 % right,...well, I dont see the reason why we should bother trading at the first place...

With the idea behind PM strategy aplied to high volatility pairs like EJ, GU and GJ, I believe making 50-100 pips is not that rare from happening. And the statistic will not come to that worst if you trade this with a decent knowledge about the system.

So look for arrowed small candles close to the THV and make your guess! It's as simple as that.

Btw here's another example:

The orginal system became a mess of indicators and a cpu hog. LOL

so much for simple

--- 帖子 #557 ---
NG...thanks again.

A few questions if you don't mind...

1. The MA THV Coral...is this different than the original nonlag MA from IAMNOEL? If so, can you post it?

2. Which t/f do you use mostly to plan your trade setups?

thanks buddy

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hi there!

1. Yes... The NonLagMa is still there in my chart as entry and exit pls check again, THV coral is just a special MA we use as trade filter.

I am not sure I can re-distribute the THV Coral, but you can find it and download easily and directly as part of THV trading system. Please look the Trading System Folder here in FF.

2. M15 is the least. Dot go below 15. Instead, go with Higher TimeFrame like H1 or H4 or more, you will see that this startegy gets evenmore powerful. But you will trade less and have to maintain bigger SL.

Just look for an arrow signal pointing at a relatively small candle for entry in any timeframe bigger than the 15.

NG

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Many Indicator that I put there is only for explaining reason. I trade with less..

Anyway, it's really does not matter if we use 100 indicator or a blindchart to do the trade. Just use (or not use) whatever indicator or system that give you the best chance to win the next trade. It's just a personal preference.

Winning is all that matters.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Stay ridiculous! And be consistent....!

Do you know that if you continuously risk less than 15 pips and aim for  100 pips, in 10 trades you can make 80 pips by winning only 2 times?

You only need to be 20% right to make money.

Some of you might think this is impossible... and a ridiculous...You might be right.... but please check out this one....

Hello Nice Guy,

I agree with you.  All you need is a profit of 10 pip a day to make good money.  Many are complaining that the non-lag bars repaint, but it is not a problem.  One could enter a trade without the non-lag bars, just like you are doing and they will be a winner.  I prefer entering a trade only in the direction of the trend shown by the two lines (nonlag and coral).   I

I am glad that somebody is finally get the idea...

Just plan your trade wisely. Plan your financial goal and how to achieve it with your MM. Many ways to play with this strategy. You can aim for a big bang by riding the trend to the last pip or just a regular 10-20 pips a day.

It's really up to you.

Anyone still using this ea?

thx

What rubbish indicator is this?

I tried creating an EA using it but it opens an order on every bar.

I use the following logic to declare the indicator and for open order logic:

double nonlagmagreen1 = iCustom(NULL, 0, "NonLagMA", 0, 21, 0, 0.0, 1, 1, 0.0, 0, 1, 1);

double nonlagmagreen2 = iCustom(NULL, 0, "NonLagMA", 0, 21, 0, 0.0, 1, 1, 0.0, 0, 1, 2);

double nonlagmared1 = iCustom(NULL, 0, "NonLagMA", 0, 21, 0, 0.0, 1, 1, 0.0, 0, 2, 2);

double nonlagmared2 = iCustom(NULL, 0, "NonLagMA", 0, 21, 0, 0.0, 1, 1, 0.0, 0, 2, 2);

if (InTrade == false && nonlagmagreen1 != 0 && nonlagmagreen2 != 0)

{

Order = SIGNAL_BUY;

InTrade = true;

buyFlag = true;

}

if (InTrade == false && nonlagmared1 != 0 && nonlagmared2 != 0)

{

Order = SIGNAL_SELL;

InTrade = true;

sellFlag = true;

}

You can backtest the EA to see what I mean.

There are 3 perfect entry happened from last night. There are also about three false signal repainted (the last one is not).

If you risking 10-15 to get 25-50 pips, and you keep entering when those signal happened you'll be up for 45-105 pips with GBPUSD ONLY from last night.

GBPUSD M15
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The same setup is also happened with GJ and EU.

Yes, we all know that the MTF will repaint, but if we figure out how to trade this repainting indicator I believe it's still produce a powerfull signal and has its own potential to make many green pips.

It's purely statistic game between winning and losing

Anyway, what is not repaint in this life?

Lets say this... When you buy a Plane ticket, the ticket will tell you when you should arrive in the airport to take the flight. At this point, we actually see a SIGNAL that the plane will take flight at the written time on the ticket.

But, please tell me how many times in our travelling life we experience a delayed flight?... Bad Weather, Broken Engine, Plane Hijack, Bomb in Airport, Wrong Schedule, Waiting for an important people to arrive, late arrival,..... so many probability and so much thing still open to happen.

You just there at the airport on time because you believe the statistic that your flight will not be delayed based on your experience. But guess what? The delayed flight is happening all the time. The plane ticket repaints many many times but we keep buying it anyway and keep trying to be there at the airport on time.....

Why?......Because we believe the statistic.

So keep it simple.

Hi Niceguy

Would you mind posting the rule again here with a chart please.. i think  the PM strategy is diffrement from your last chart. I could be wrong but if u can post a simple chart and point out in chart explaining the rule would be awsome

thanks

--- 帖子 #570 ---
The Only Rule for this Strategy is the one from first post. I never mess with the rule. I only suggesting to enter whenever you see an Arrow Signal with a relatively Small candle near  THV Coral. This is for filtering bad trades only...

As for RR and MM please feel free to find the one suitable for you and your account size. Many good combination of RR can be played to make a good MM.

I have faith with this strategy, today I went live with this...

I decided to use  fixed SL 20 pips (or less) and 40 Pips TP.

I fire and forget. I messed up with EU today, I see the price go against me in a sudden movement and pass the NLM. I jumped in and closed the trade with + 3 pips, but after checking back a couple hour later, I regret that decision. It should've  hit TP If I didn't jumped in. Oh well...

Btw.. Got 50 green pips for today. That's should be enough for a day.

To any of you guys who demoing this system, I really suggesting you guys to only take signal  during EU, London and NY. I have positive result with signal that come up during this time and have bad result with signal from Tokyo and Sidney.

Here's my biggest winner for today:

Great Job NiceGuy, you trade with m15 timeframe and with THV standard coral setting?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
hi trader,

thanks for the stg.

have some problems with the indicator but i manage to solve it .

got to copy all the files into the folder.

and what is the different between 4bars_mp_nlma and 4bars_mtf_nlma ??

what different with their setting ?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Yes... I am bad with setting up an indicator so I leave 'em as it is. It turns out the THV Coral doing great as Support and resistance for NLMA, yhat's why I use it.

Like with other system, I believe there will be a good times and bad times with this system in the future. With my current R:R, I will make money just by being 40% right.

In the end, it's all about statistic.

If you can afford to maintain higher SL, and want to trade less, higher TF would be your choice. This strategy gets even more powerful there....

Btw.... whenever you see the coral going flat... Pls stay away. Market is Ranging.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I dont have anything else to do..

So I keep updating this thread so anyone can review

I've learned something valuable  today.

Thanks for the info, so to say the truth u only need to be in front of the screen during these 3 critical timing am i right? i think thv is great but with the nonlag dots 21 and 84 that gives more confirmation on the trade currently up 100 pips since 2 days ago on e/u and g/u thanks.

but does 21 and 84 apply to 5 min as well?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Yes.. you only need to be on screen during these 3 timing each day to lookfor signal and fire th trade when you find one.

Yes, you can use Non Lag Dots 84 or whatever make you comfortable to trade, I like THV because how it play as Support and Resistance for the price. You can almost bet on any candles that cross THV and win...

Never playing M5 with this strategy, maybe I should go back to demo M5. We can maintain lower SL with M5. I look into it. Thanks...

Btw here's a pic for GBPJPY today...

See how one can be up for more than 100 pips by entering those arrow...

And please also see how london reversing what tokyo and EU build....

Hi Guys... have you tried the EA for this from Page 1. Is it good?

I think if we can give time filter to the EA for only trade at specified time, that might be something wort to pursue...

I am on BE today... Nailed 40 pips with UJ but EJ and GU gave that back...

Reason of my failure is repainted MTF for GU and eat 20 pips, And for EJ... This is stupid thing... I was late but forcing my way in, pullback eat my SL and after that it continues to the direction I was entering. Should've use more SL, but that would screw my RR. Oh well... let's see more in monday. I am up 50 pips for this week, that's fine with me.

I've learned that signal from London is so powerful... It's like london breakout but with less SL.

Hi NiceGuy,

Yes I recently installed the EA on a demo accnt. Set it to give alerts w/ pop up box. Worked well, then I set it on automatic w/ a 30pip s/l and 5 pip t/p. It nailed around 10 winning trades in a row, then stopped working. I don't know if it's the broker or the EA? Well if you have any luck getting it to work please let me know what broker. I'm not sure if it will work on ECN type.

Regards...

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Thanks for reply...

What TF do you use?

30SL for 5 TP... I dont know man... seems like a risky business to me. One fall could wipeout you 6x wins... too scary for me. But If that's working for you guess that's alright.

Thanks, will try the EA soon

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi NiceGuy,

I put it on the 15min timeframe w/ all currency pairs under 5pips. I originally set it to t/p 15 but kept hitting s/l. So I changed it to 5 and it started winning... I just reset demo account and it made another win, so I guess it's still working. I took MTF indicators off chart to save memory, so I guess EA checks expert indi folder okay. I'll let it run for around 100 trades to get better estimate, because you can't do bactests w/ MTF indis.

Kind regards...

Nice way to start the new trading week

I am Up for 90 pips today... No loses!

GBPUSD=  40 pips

EURJPY= 50 pips

Total from last Week: + 50

Final: + 140 pips

I decided to change my SL to 25 and TP to 50 for EJ and GJ as they seems to move faster (more Volatile). Maybe I should do it too for GU.

Btw, here's the trade:

Great trading man...I caught 10 pips of the UJ...closed out trade early to sleep more. Got up 2:00am my time to trade.

I don't worry about what I missed...only what I actually lose.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Yes! You are absolutely correct. One of the greatest "fear" in trading is not just about losing trade but also to feel leaving too many in table. I read this somewhere. If we can conquer both fear I guess we are one step closer to be a good trader. I believe trading is about conquering ourself from hope and fear. That's the hardest part of become a good trader.

Somehow I am not feeling so happy or exciting in winning my trades anymore. I guess that kind of thing is already pass me. Because I know exactly in the future there might be a losing day, or a week or maybe a month but hopefully not come to a year.

It's really doesn't matter what system or how good we are, somehow those bad days seems always manage to find a way to come around. In the end it's all about statistic of how much we are winning and loosing. The best we can do is just to improve the probability to be more on our side. That's where skills and experience come to play.

Btw... keep that 10 pips coming. As long as you are good at it, you can always crank up the contract to make more money..

As far as this strategy goes for me, I think this strategy is good for "not so big" contract kind of trades. The drawdown might be too hard for me to stomach if using high contract too early. But I guess I'll have to see more how this strategy perform in the future...

I'll be back tomorrow with more trades...

It's a simple standard RSI from MT4. I just got used to see it lies there in my chart . I used it mainly to spot a possible divergence.

The setting is RSI 6 , Price Medium H/L.

I dont see a clean signal today as GU, GJ and UJ stay in range. I saw that from the coral going flat at open price today. I should've enter EU or EJ and make money but I was doubting my entry because of the size of the entry candle was bigger than I can afford for my SL.

No trade so far.

As I write this, I see GU and GJ has made up it's mind and going up. Once again, the candle is too big for my SL and I really dont wanna force my way in as it only bring me troubles like yesterday. Will wait for small candles entry near the coral. Otherwise no trade for me.

I used to trade THV and I like their indicator. They are pretty well done. That candle is supposed to show us how far the current price from the opening price. Green means we're above,  red means we are below open price. So another way to say is that is the daily candle...

That candle came along if we use THV daily pivots in our chart.

Thank you!

Just wanted to specify what settings do you use for Nonlag MTF? How many dots for the arrow on what timeframes?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
So, you are back to your favorite pair...EU...you always do well with that pair.

BTW, your 20 pips loss...in almost all your previous wins, you had 3 or more up candles in a row, then a down candle. Your latest post only had two ups, then down, then up, then down.

Looks like the price did not finish where it wanted to before dropping.

Remember, you said that EU likes to test line 3 times before dropping. On your chart, you hedged after the second test. The first test was at 7 gmt, the second at 12 gmt, and the third at 15 gmt and actually crossed the 50 sma line.

After the third, we have a double top...and it now looks to me to change direction and head south.  Just my observation

I like when there is 4 or more candles up/down, then change of direction.

I am using 5M and 15M...but I am only looking at GU and UJ

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Glad it works for you...

Yes the Coral is really good... like I said before many times... We almost can bet on any candle that cross it and win.

My MTF NLM sets only change to 20 and 3 candles for the arrow. M15 TF. That's it.

Take a look at this:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Like the last trade on EU, where I lost 20 pips... The candles was passing coral but my RR wanted me to hunt for 40 TP. If I only wanted 20 pips or in front of computer, that trades should've been a winner or at least not cost me the whole 20 pips. But I was leaving the trades for watching movie with my family... . Oh well... Just another lose in my statistic...

Better luck tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Fantastic observation...

Yes you know that I was rushing in..

For this system, I like to keep my entry based on that arrow. So in the end of the month I am hoping to have a statistic whether this arrow is reliable or not as my entry. I trade only with minor account for now. Just to have statistic refference for that arrow in live trading before moving this one to my regular account.

So far + 160 pips is not so bad...

Btw.. I am doing this also to educate and improve my skills to trade multi pairs. I used to trade only EU before. Some of you may do better job than me, please share...

nice system , i've studied thv system brings good result too if the coral rules or basicly respected.

i've set up  the nonlag v7 but how do you manage the arrows, they don't appear on my chart ( alert and warning set to 1 )

thanks

--- 帖子 #606 ---
bleu...u really only need nonlag ma 21 and rsi (6). i also use sma 50 to determine the trend.

to learn, follow niceguy's charts

Hello NiceGuy, can I ask for you to give coral indi here plz? I do use search but to many THV zip is confuseing for me Thx

--- 帖子 #608 ---
No need to...

The easiest way to get my chart setup is  with installing the THV system and load their basic template and replace the Trix with the MTF NLM and after that you can add or remove any incator u wished.... How bout that? It's not gonna get easier than that....

Guys... I fell to sleep during london.. so I missed the big move in Euro and Gbp pairs...  . Hope you guys not....

But I won 23 pips for today....

Here is my last trade....

EU M15

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is the  perfect entry I am looking for. I only use 7 pips SL for this trade....

1. Arrow appearing

2. Small Candle bellow the arrow

3. Pass Coral

That's the sign of perfect entry. Ridiculously Small SL for ridiculously big TP..... That's what I call a good trade...

Got stop out at 23 pips because I am using an EA to trail my order and move my SL based on fractals, if not I will get my whole 40 pips TP....

I am not sure if  trailing our order would be a good Idea....

Back at 180 Pips up for now.....

Hi guys, you can get thv complete system free from : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=127271

I have know thv system long time but still unable to use it to profit with it.  Following niceguy method, it should work more winning than losing.  Thv coral is able to mimic sma 60 on anytime frame. I think?

NiceGuy, what timeframe you are using to trade your system?

Regards

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Thank you for that THV Link....

My system is M15. If you can afford bigger SL and willing to trade less for bigger profit, higher TF would be your place. This system is getting even more powerful there...

As for THV Coral...

I have tried in the past to put on MA 60 and tweak the settings here and there but can not mimic the Coral Perfectly (maybe it's just me).... That's why I keep using the coral....

Hi guys!

Got more than 5 people PM me today... They suggesting me to start a new thread for my method with clearer explaination. ( I wonder how am I supposed to be more clearer with all of those charts lying around this thread? Aren't they clear enough already? )

Somehow they think I give an edge to the THV and PM forex strategies at the same time with my approach.

Maintain a thread....hmm, now that's sounds a bit too much for me... but if you guys think my method can make you more profit... (or at least can make you lose less...) I might doing it.

What do you say? Does this thing deserves a new thread?

Thanks.

Hi Sasa

The arrow is from 4BARS-MTF-NLMA 1.03.mq4.

First post, First Thread.

If you dont see an arrow coming, make sure you enable the alert option inside the indi and set 3 dots for arrow.

If this is does not help you, then it's way beyond me...

Hi there bleutneut

Do you really need all those indicators?

Here is my set up.

see image

...and I am debating with myself whether or not I need the pivot indicator

OK......now I am mostly talking to myself here, but I really think as I mature as a trader I want less and less indicators.....I want simplicity, I want trades to be really clear, screaming.....this is a good trade.....or .....hmmm....not sure....stay away......if I am ever to start trading larger numbers of lots.....I need my system to be simple and clear....I have several templates I use, one for a higher time frame view (one indicator).....one for an hourly view (two indicators) and one for entries .....now I will admit that I have been toying with which various set ups....and I am still not quite settled, but I keep coming back this thread.

"niceguy" has been valiently keeping this thread alive......and I admire his contributions......anyways....just some comments as I watch the Asian market....don't normally take trades in the Asian.....today I should have

Guys,

Thanks for holding the fort while I am away with real job.  Been very busy last couple of weeks, and will still be for the next few weeks.

Got some time catching up on reading, as today is a holiday from where I am.  Very interesting addition there, NiceGuy, and I wouldnt mind if you can start your own thread, and post the link here.

I also updated Post#1 with the THV coral as provided by maxwell-eqtn.

Now, there you are.....

Glad you are not forgeting your way home to this thread...

Another 40 Pips winner with only 10 pips SL for me!

This is what I call Niceguy style of tradng...
Risk ridiculously small to win Ridiculously Big!

Now I am at + 220 pips Up.

You can see clearly where I put my stop loss.

To any of you who just enter this FX business, please..I mean...Please... keep in mind that you dont have to trade everytime you open MT4 and you definitely do not have to trade everyday.

Trade only when you see a big opportunity to make money without exposing your account into a risk you can not stomach to lose. This is a business, we should pay  attention.

Hi NG,

What's the yellow MA's value, right below the THV Coral?

Hope I can absorb as much as I can today.  Nice trading, NiceGuy!  Because of limited time, I would like to demo GJ for its high volatility.

Your guidance is highly appreciated.

Anyways, isn't it true that the ARROW appears on the previous candle, right after a new one opened?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi IamNoeL!

The MA is 240 LW, Close.

If you wanna trade GJ, your best bet would be when GU and UJ is moving to the same direction. The easiest way to see that they are lining up is to look for the time when GU and UJ is coming out from overbought or oversold area at the same time in higher TF.  If this happen, GJ is capable to give you 50 pips jump in one candle.

You might need some kind of MTF Stoch that has an alert. This way you will have a strong trade, because you have higher TF confirmation and also 2 Major pairs confirmation at the same time. Close your trade when these 2 is split up.

I dont trade GJ oftenly... My broker spread is killing me.

Yes, the Arrow is Appearing when a candle closed. I just found out recently that we can set this option to false in the MTF indi so the arrow will appear right on cross. But this way.. we will get too many arrow scattering in our chart making a real  headache.....

NG

--- 帖子 #623 ---
MTF Stoch.  Sorry, not too techie, if ever I found it, how does it work?

Sample scenario:

I want to trade GY 15M

I need to open UJ and GU H1, with the MTF Stoch on it?  Then if both are is overbought level, I open a SELL on GY?  Of course, using our PMforex System signals as well.

What does the 240MA do, if I may ask please?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #624 ---
That will do.... but you know what.... just dont mind what I said. That will only confuse you and others more. My apologize.

The easiest way to catch up what you missed would be to open a demo account with USD 350 only. After the spreads you will have about 10 entry with 30 SL for 0.1 lots. Always aim for 60-75 TP. (Remember that you need to maintain relatively bigger SL for GJ.)

Now, Take the first arrow signal you see from the MTF after london open .  Do it everyday dan do not enter anything else. Enter it and forget it. Comeback tomorrow. You will see some repaints and you will have your loses but I think you will be surprise with result and how long your USD 350 will last.

I've been doing this myself, (but since I have more time to stay on screen I took signal from various time in order to get a less risk)...

Starting with USD 300 live account.... Now I am only USD 80 away to double it in less than 2 weeks.

Please try...

I agree with you concerning the fact to display less indies as possible

I'm actually testing and eliminating indies one by one

As concern my original question, the fact is that the nonlag mtf 1.03, doesn't load even when i remove totally chart from indies ?

how can i make it work properly ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Bleutneut, it may be your computer that is causing the indie to not load properly. I am having the same difficulty as you on my main computer, however, it loaded fine on my second computer.

On my main computer, i have gone with 2 nonlagmas. One at 21 and one at 84, on the same chart. It tells me what I need to know without having the MTF indie.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
hello maxwell-eqtn, thx for this

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi again, got few questions to cheer up for readers:

1)You enter your position right after the 15min candle closed below the coral?

2)For stop lost, how many pips above the previous candle you recommend, which is relatively small, to get a better risk-reward ratio.

3)Does the color of the coral matters during entering a short position or a long position?

4)What is the name of your trailingstop EA?

Thank you very much.

Have a nice trade.

Regards

Chrisyeap

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi Chris!

1. Yes...My entry usually right after the 15min candle closed below/above the coral.  But sometimes sooner, it really depends on the arrow and the whole Price action movement and other Pairs movement told me. We still have to use our common sense and judgement before we place the entry. I am not always win you know....

2. It really depends on how much you are willing to take as a loss. Let's say you have very limited funds like USD 400 and you want to risk 5% of it for every trade. So entering with 0.1 lots, your maximum sL should be at 20 pips.

So basicly what I do  when I see an arrow is coming up above/below a candle, I measure the candle itself. If the candle is more than 20 pips I would stay away. It's simply because my MM can not afford the deal. You dont have to trade everytime you see an opprotunity you know, you just have to enter  only when you can afford that deal.

If the arrowed candle is smaller than the Maximum SL my MM suggesting I would put the SL at H/L of that candle or as far away my MM can afford . Please check my 2 latest trade where I risk only 17 pips in total to earn total 63 Pips. This is a very good deal! I waited for this deal to appear. And only enter when I see one. That's why I dont trade too often.

More than 2 times I am experimenting to rush in for a deal. I Know the candle is way bigger, but I forced my way in. This is where I lost the deal. Cost me about 80 pips drawdown so far. Why this is happenede? It's simply because the SL is not placed in the proper position. I can not afford the proper SL.

If you can afford more SL, best place for SL should be the latest High and Low based on fractal. You wont lose too many, but pls make sure you can afford when the loss is happen first before you enter.

The key answer to this is to ONLY ENTER THE TRADE YOUR MM CAN AFFORD.   So the SL could be placed in a decent place.  This whole thing is a business, we should pay attention to this kind of thing.

3. Honestly I never pay attention to its color. .  I enter where the arrow showed me. As long as I see a small candle is crossing  or near the coral mostly I am in. Still we have to use our observation and judgement in this.

4. I got the TrailingStopFrCnSAR EA from free section  here: http://translate.google.com/translat...on.narod.ru%2F

The EA can trail your order based on candle or fractals. Many times this EA prevent me to achieve the targeted profit. So be wise when using it.

How's that sound? Am I making myself clear?

NG

NOTE: Plaese keep remember th NIceguy style to stay ridiculuous. Risk ridiculously small and win ridiculuously big. Your win should be at least 2x your SL so you can make money even if you lose 60% of time. "Good trader is not a trader who make more winning, but a trader who keep on losing but somehow still make money". My fellow trader once told me this.

NiceGuy.....the thread has evolved off of what iamnoel started.....and you are the leading contributor (many thanks)

I think a new thread makes sense.......see what develops.

It seems you have really settled into this set up, which is great.

I know that many people are appreciative of your posts.

The only "work" that you would need to do, is to write up the method, post the indicators.....and then just continue on what you are doing.

I hope you do.

In life, making a difference can be very fulfilling......I think you are making a difference for a number of people.

Hi Guys...

Just scored 20 pips with GU.

I aimed for 40... but got chikened out with incoming news in few minutes...

This is where I use a common sense to justify my entry.

I am not entering right away when a new candle open, I waited few minutes to let it pass a strong barier in front.....

--- 帖子 #637 ---
how do i install the indicators and non lag ma's on my broker platform ?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Whatfx...copy the indicators to C/programs/yourmt4/experts/indicators folder

close your platform and reopen. then apply indicators to chart...15M is best for this I think...I use CCI 20 on typical/3 as a good as filter for entry.

I also use 50 EMA on typical/3 for entry when price is moving in direction of trend but IAMNOEL's criteria was not met. I use two consecutive bars closing below or above 50 EMA.

For example (for a sell trade), I like when we have at least three maybe four, five, or six up candles. The more the stronger. Then, the reversing candle has a higher high than the last up candle and closes at least below 50% of last up candle (if last up candle has high of 1.3000 and low is 1.2980, reverse candle must close below 1.2990

Also, never trade this against main 1 hour trend or maybe even the 4 hour trend. One does miss some good trades against the trend, but one also misses many losses.

Too me, this system is excellent when the 15M has deviated away from the main trend and then re-joins it. The re-join is where the pips are.

Not that impressive....

Just burned -40 pips today. Entering GU and EU before London, and price finally decided to turn against me after london...

Now At +200 pips...

NG

--- 帖子 #640 ---
To my mind, the hour before London has always been quite dangerous. I prefer to trade during the hour before Frankfurt open and then the hour after London open (5-6 GMT + 7-8 GMT).

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Thanks for the advice. This just means I need to get up at 1:00am instead of 2:00am...

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Or move to a better time zone

But really, I have suffered very much under the false breakouts right before London open. Especially, when trading EU and EY. I am not sure about GU as it often starts its real move before London. But GU has been very bad to trade lately, and GY even worse. Ranging like hell.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Yes I notes that too and I knew that was dangerous time because market can turn around and shoots back right after London...... but that candles was sooooo tempting....

Should work more on my discipline.

Many Thanks

Hello gspe,

would it be possibile to modify the MTF indicator so that we can choose to display  only the tf we need. I like to trade on 5M chart with the visual support of 30M but by default I must see 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h dots.

One week, when I think it is better to trade on M15, we get better setups on M5. When I go to M5, we get better setups on M15.

Go figure!

I still think M5 is better for this system...any thoughts?

thanks

jacob

--- 帖子 #648 ---
jacob, good question. I was looking at that over the weekend on eu and gu and came to no real conclusion. I found my entry points would have been comparable. I may have entered a position slightly sooner on M5 but also found more potential for stop loss being hit.

All that being said, I did not change the nonlagma parameters on M5 versus M15. This could have made a difference. If we are looking at M5, should we change that parameter from 21 to 7? Maybe it does not make a difference......I will look at that. If someone else has thoughts that would be great.

How did everyone do with this strategy today on eu? it was in a tight range for a long period with only 1 breakout. I was able to catch it for about 15 pts, but got out as it retraced. I wasn't sure if it was going to range again or not. Once out,. it is hard to jump back in.

Looking forward to your thoughts....

--- 帖子 #649 ---
capstone...I never thought about changing from 21...If I recall, there was no real consensus on time frame, but no one ever mentioned about changing non lag value...you may be on to something.

Let us know what you find out please.

thanks

--- 帖子 #650 ---
jacob, after looking at this in real time this morning on a few charts, I would not use the 7 nonlagma on the 5 minute chart. To many signals come from it. I would guess it will change your win rate significantly. Stick with what niceguy has, even on the M5. The only thing I have done is to change the RSI filter. Instead of having it above or below 50, I want it below 45 for short and above 55 for long. Seems like a small difference, I know, but it makes me feel better about my position.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi guys!

How do you guys doing out there?

I was just adding 50 nice healthy pips today with this strategy with my approach.

I created a small account with only USD 300 inside it in purpose to test out trading this strategy with my approach. Today, I  just double it up and add another 20 pips by trading it less than two weeks.

I dont think I want to start a new thread for my approach as myself still obey the original rules of this strategy. So basicly I did not invented a new strategy. Maybe I did add an edge to the way we should look for entry in this strategy. But I dont think that makes a new strategy.

Besides I dont think I will have the time and energy to maintain the new thread in the future.

I believe many of you who follow me closely and take a good really look on the chart is already making pips with my appproach. I did.

But for any of you who have not succeeded, I will make this so clear and so clean so you guys can start make money:

There is always one signal for 3 market times that will give you pips. One in tokyo (before EU), one right after London, and one after US. It keeps repeating itself on and on. Please study the left side of you chart to confirm this.

So basicly, you just have to lpick one of these signal and trade it with good RR. Trade the same signal everyday and if you use less SL than TP, most likely  you will make money. If you happen not to see a signal during your prefered trading times or if you notes that there's unusual volatility in the same market times you prefered to trade, then dont trade. That's it and that's all.

Dont fall to that hole where most guys in forex do. Most guys will fall to a condition where they unconsiously keep looking for a holy grail system. Use this strategy or use another. Stick with it and let your statistic say the result for you. Dont keep on inventing things you dont really need.

This is not a game or entertainment that we can play whenever we want.  This forex thing is supposed to be a business, a job, a work or an  investment. Like any other job, we just have to do the same thing everyday to make money. We just got to have the required attitude and discipline to make this to work.

It's very important for us to keep track on our trade statistic. And it is easier to compare one trade to another if we keep on using the same market times for our trading times. this way we can learn from our mistake in the past and use it to our advantage in the future. It's hard to do that if we keep on trading in random times because (as we all know) the price volatility are different for every market.

Keep the pips comin guys!

Hey,

I've been looking into this system for 2 days now and it looks really interesting. I am unclear with 2 little things, if anyone could clear it up I would really appreciate it.

First, how does the coral fit into the initial rules? I red a post of Niceguy seeing how one should only grab signals near the coral. Does this mean that I should look for more pullbacks into the coral or I can trade signals that break the coral as well? Also we are still using a 10-15 target?

Atm for me a nice solution would be to divide the trade into 2 parts, close one at the first target then let the second run till PA shows exhaustion or wait for the nlma to change colors.

My second question is how do you plot the arrow signals on the chart? I made myself a personal template and I also tried the one that NG uploaded in the post above, I'm not sure if I'm missing an indicator.

Thanks,

Diez

Hi Niceguy and everyone

Good work on keeping the thread going. I'm trying to load the indicators but having a problem. The 4BARS-MTF-NLMA-1.03 indicator is not drawing any green and red bars and the arrows are not appearing on the chart, see below. Could someone please confirm which indicator draws the arrows? Is it the NLMA? And would anyone have any idea why the NLMA green and red bars are not drawing? I've compiled the indis, restarted the platform and dragged and dropped them in but keep getting the same result. [Edit: arrows look like they come from the NonLagMA but I'm not sure)

Thanks for your help

Hi NG

Which pairs do you trade?

This is an internal debate I have with myself.

I think that trading GBPUSD and EURUSD is like just doubling ones position size, since often (not always) the pairs trade in a similar direction.

I sometimes think I should just trade one pair.

I am curious what pairs you trade?

Thanks for keeping this thread going

PGPB

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Nothing is special with my pairs...

They are...EU GU EJ UJ

I only hit EJ when EU & UJ going to the same direction.

I want to trade GJ but the spread is killing me...

I am not always win you know.. Yesterday I lost 20 pips with GU but made another 30 pips with Ej and 28 pips UJ. I just enter where that arrow showed me and try to use the smallest stop possible. And keep dong it when I see the arrow appear near coral. If the tade is good price will not mess with the small SL.

Many times I hit 40 pips just by risking only 8-15 pips. But I also have lost 3 times straight few days ago... but those three lost only cost me about 40 pips. Then I score another 80 pips in the next day...

Here's where I score 20 pips today after London with UJ. Using only 8 pips stop loss. Score another 20 wit EJ later on jus before NY.

Small stop loss will make you able to go on and on to the next trade.

How's that...

Here is looking at you NiceGuy !!!

I had to exit, that was enough for me. It was very close to 40 pips.

Great work man.

I am also trying other entry signals to see if they are better than the nonLag arrows.  Will keep you guys posted on my findings.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Yes...yes..yes... I like that... I like that...

Yes you are right... You can close the trade anytime when your daily  target is achieved or whenever you feel there's something wrong.

But when you are able to risk less than 10, just ride it as long as  possible because the worst that can happened is for you to lose that 10  pips but the opportunity to win 40 -75 pips are also wide open for you....

Experiment and use whatever indi that you want... as long as it work for you... It's your gold.

Good luck man!

Hi Maxwell

Nice trading!

Can I please check your settings for the 4BARS-MTF-NLMA_1.03. My chart didn't give the arrow where yours did (the green line on my chart is where your arrow appeared).

Does the NLMA only give an arrow if there are 3 bars coloured the same are all in a row eg M15, M30 and H1 all are green. So if H1 was red but the others are all green as per example below, no arrow will be given, as the 3 green bars are broken up by the H1 red bar in the middle? This might explain why I didn't get an arrow where you did. Hope this is making sense lol. I have clicked between timeframes to update any repaints. My settings are:

Length: 20

Price: 0

ColorBarBack: 1

Bar Width: 0

Dotsforarrow: 3

If so the next question is why my H1 line on the NLMA (2nd from top) at the green vertical line (your green arrow) never went green like yours, the bars stayed red. I can imagine it maybe taking a bar or two to change due to broker differences, but to go 4 candles without a change strikes me as a big disrepancy. Does anyone have any ideas why? I just wish to confirm that my indi is calculating correctly. Does anyone else have the same bars as me for the EJ chart below?

Thanks Occam

Hello Im trying to download all the indicators on post #1 but some of the indicators when downloaded to my desktop come as white sheets of paper and others come up as the actual indicator. How do i fix the white sheets to the actual indicators?

Thanks.

Hi NiceGuy, I entered long E/U this morning when 15min candle crossed coral with and arrow pointing up, then somehow hours later, the arrow was shifted position to the right again, meaning repaint.

I realized since 4bars MTF is an indicator with 15M, 30M, 4H, 1D; someone it will get repaint if the 4 hours bars not confirmed in the same direction.  Do you think it is best to wait till 4H candle close and at the same time the arrow is pointing right crossing the coral?  For that purpose I have downloaded an MTF candle time indicator at:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...26#post2719026

Please advise.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Not sure what you mean by 'white sheets' but something similar can happen when the download changes the name of the indicator to attachment.php . This sometimes happens to me when downloading FF files. Not sure why.

But the solution is just to change the name to what it should be (per the indicator name on the first post) after you have downloaded an indicator, then u should be ok. But note the names must be exactly the same as in the first post, as some of the indicators use the other indicators when calculating. If they have a different name they wont work.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Yes the arrow repaints... I know that from the start. That's why I am using small stop loss and still I managed to scalp almost 400 pips with this repaints indicator.

All you need to do is a bit training to get used to with the sistem. Once you get the hang of  it  you will know when to enter and when to stay away. As for your trade example, that was the risky one because the coral is a bit flat after tokyo and if you see to the left that the highest tops of EU is getting lower and lower from late NY.

That's not a good sign to go further long because in H4 there is a good chance that the trend will change and heading SOUTH after LONDON.. At least we should d wait and see.

I am not always win too...  We still have to use a common sense and reading patterns too..

Btw.. Please test out your theory with that h4 candle and share your result with us here....

NG

PS: Shit! Chris.... I am using FX Pro (live) what is your broker?... after a quick examination I can see  clearly that there's a different price feed between your chart and mine. I dont have those two pinbar on top, left to your chart. ... and oh no.. you were on m30 and i am at m15. That's explain everything.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Niceguy, I am using IBFX mini account live.  BTW, I will test 4 hour candle close on M15 chart strategy and let u guys know.  Meaning, I will try to see every close of 4H candle and justify the price against the coral line.  I guess we will eliminate more trades but definitely get a better ones.  Guess will take me long time to test this out because I am working full time job during London sessions.

I hope you guys stayed away. I did.. Market is pretty much ranging after london in M15. I guess this are the times when this startegy suffer the worst. So many arrows... Thanks to coral that give an early warning.

Pull out only 10 pips, but also gave up 20 pips early on Tokyo today.. We just can't win all the time...

Well... First I would like to thank Niceguy, iamnoel, and whoever in this threads who has given your tools and share your experiences.

I think my laptop is not good enough to run all the indicators in the post #1.

NonLagMA without MTF is still running fine.

MTF without NonLagMA is showing nothing.

At the end... MTF + NonLagMA is resulting MT4 hang.

Looks like i'm not lucky enough to try this all. I'm not sure about the minimum spec of laptop which can run this.

Ok,

I just changed the way the indicator chooses how many bars back to go to draw the indicator on the chart. No other changes. On my system ( a few years old) ( a pentium d Duo 3.2 Mgz with 4GB ram ) used only 50percent of one processor and only 1 GB of memory while loading this indicator.

It took 3 minutes to load and it will look like your MT4 is hanging. The more bars you have on your chart the longer it will take to load...

I have not tested this in a live environment (since this is the weekend) but it should work well. Please post comments if you find a bug.

Mark

p.s.  The variable CalculateVisibleBarsOnly = true  enables this new feature, if you set it to false it will behave as before.

I have added in a 4 hour and a 15 minute Supertrend line, to keep me on the right side of trades

See images in next post

Image one has the 4 hour supertrend line, with the 15 minute supertrend line below

this tends to produce better trades than when the 15 minute supertrend line is above the 4 hour as in image two

So I am going to experiment with adding these rules to the MTF NLMA trading

when the 15 minute supertrend line is above the 4 hour (the thicker line) the arrows from the 4 BAR MTF NLMA are less reliable

Hope this helps

Look at the color of ST, too.

For defining a downtrend you need m15 to be under h4 and both red.

For uptrend - m15 above h4 and both green.

Chrisyeap

Glad you found it helpful.

The one thing that will help any system is ."screen time".....traders who have spent hours, days, weeks, months, years looking at charts, will often do better than those who do not have this behind them.

I have noticed that often niceguy will give reasons for entering the trade, that are beyond "an arrow appeared"....this is because he has developed an eye for charts.

Adding in the "supertrend_nrp_mtf" lines provides a bit of a filter.

If you load up the template attached and scroll back, I think you will see that adding the rule.....

"Only take trades when the 4 hour and 15 minute are lined up, and the same color" ......will filter out some bad trades.....you may miss a few good ones also, but better to miss a lot of bad ones and an occasional good one

....but it will always come down to "screen time"....and getting a feel for the charts.

Best wishes

Arrow!

Remember that I want to keep this system as simple as possible for me to follow. So I am looking for an arrow near the coral. Once I see that arrow come up then I measure the candle pointed by that arrow. If that candle is less than 20 pips, I am in. If that candle is too long I stayed away. I keep repeating that in all my trades. It is as simple as that.

I lost about 50% times but managed to dig out more than 400 pips so far (I lost count) with this strategy. Once I triple my USD 300 account I want to move this one to my regular Account and making real money there.

The key to success in this strategy is.. (as I said it oftenly) to use smallest SL as possible. My MM suggest me to use maximum of 20 pips as SL, but many times I use only 8-15 pips as SL. Take your losers easily and move on. You will get your winner soon enough. Make sure you aim at least twice your SL. Many times I aim triple and win.

Put your SL at the end of the candle with arrow (+ spreads) should oftenly do the trick.

One thing that also important to mention is .....Once you enter the trade, stay away. Let the market decide for you which one will get hit your SL or TP and accept that as part of the business. Many times I jumped to a trade and make a changes here and there but soon I realize that this activity is only do me more harm than good. Many times I failed to maximize my profit because I interfere the trade.

It's always tempting to close our trade as soon as we see 10 or 20 pips in our favour, but I realize that the more I do that the more I harm my MM and my whole trading statistic.

Dont be afraid to lose my friend... It's like Muhammad Ali who keep endures the hit from his opponent before finally make his move and put his opponent on the floor.  His Statististic also said that Ali win the fight  ridiculuously more than he lost it. It's like that. The profit of this strategy is coming out from the statistic  we'll see in the end of the month and not by how many you won your trades.

So keep risking ridiculuously small and aim for ridiculuosly big.

If you do that with discipline, I am pretty sure that this strategy will beat the forex for you.

Hope this helps...

NG

--- 帖子 #699 ---
NG...this is good stuff.

Do you wait for the candle with arrow to close before entering trade?

Is 20 pips from high to low or from open to close?

thanks man

--- 帖子 #700 ---
From Closing to the lowest for buy and Highest for sell. Dont forget to add your spread there. Yes, I waited that candle to closed.

You know what... I think you should try to trade this properly in demo. Open with only USD 300 - 400 in your demo account and see how well this will go for you. You are simply looking for small candles with arrow near coral to trade. If you can not afford that candle, stay away.  It's as simple as that and it worked.

This strategy saves me from reading candles all the times. Just follow that arrow and dont revenge the market as soon as your trade hits SL. Take a rest and come back another day or at least wait for another market to open. Be patience. Dont get bothered with that "I should've done this or I should've not done that" sentences in your head. Be a robot, and enter those trade as you see them.

Based on my experience, this strategy is good enough to make money...

Just give it a try and do it properly.

NG

--- 帖子 #701 ---
43 pips on the first and 21 pips on the second

I like how NG says....keep it simple, take trades near the coral, small SL, larger TP.....and the one bit of advice that I need to work on, is ......once in a trade, keep away and let the market either hit your TP or SL

thanks pbpg for your contribution to this strategy. I had abondoned it because it was such a memory hog, and the repainting on the arrow and MTF indie on the bottom made me nervous. I have downloaded your supertrend (which looks very similiar to the trendmagic indie), as well as your updated MTF. Looked it over this evening and made profit on first trade, even outside of normal business hours. I will dedicate to it again for the week and see how it goes.

I am assuming that it is still intended for M15 tf and pretty much all USD pairs. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #703 ---
pbpg, i am looking at the pm nonlag charts this morning. It seems that where I should see an arrow and a warning should be coming, (3 green boxes in the 4bar indie), there is no arrow. When i move to a different tf then come back to the 5M, the arrow shows where it should have before. I have also noticed that the 4bar indie will stop tracking after a bit. It comes back if I refresh the chart by switching timeframes then coming back. I am watching 4 charts at once. Could that be the problem? Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I have no idea, EllisEdi is the contributor who posted the indi, perhaps he knows.

I do not trade off 5 minute charts (two many false signals) and also I use my eyes.....if I see all the boxes line up I take a signal

It would be nice to get the arrow though......maybe the 5 minute bar had not finished ....maybe that is why you did not get an arrow.

I have not seen any issues/problems.

Hi guys...

I wonder if you could help me out here. I need an indicator to to show me  market open times in my chart as lines. Do you guys have one?

I am currently using dolly trading times indicator but this one can not show me the sidney and tokyo lines because it only has 4 available lines in it to setup.

Do you have something better?

I tried those paramount and other market times indi but those color block in the background is just too much for me. I want just a lines.

Please share if you have one...

Many Thanks

Hi NG,

I really like what you're doing here.  I took my first demo trades with last night's London open.  I had 4 winners out of 5 trades.  I couldn't find any strong trends but I'll take +40 pips any day.

Try these indies.  One should work for you.

Jim

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Many Thanks for the indicator Jim...

I am also glad that you appreciate my contribution to this thread.

I love that winners... Make sure to keep them bigger than your losers and keep them comin'...

I know many of you guys still nervous trading the MTF because the fact that it repaints. All I can say is.....

If you dont make money trading this strategy, it must be because you did not trade it properly.

Small SL and bigger TP is your answer to this.... Cut your losers short and keep your winners run until it hits the final base... If watching and waiting is too much for you. Just Enter those trades and shut down that stupid computer you keep on starring all day... and go find a party some place else .

anyways......looks interesting to me.

I will be having a closer look at this over the weekend.

I just finished a profitable week using just this strategy. Thank you to all who have contributed to the growth of the strategy here. I will continue to trade this exclusively until I get comfortable enough to add other strategies at the same time. At the moment, I am way to new to forex to add anything else. It is very nice to have confidence in one strategy and not to be a flipper anymore.

On that note, any recommendations for Monday? I usually avoid London open on Mondays as they seem rather weak (but I LOVE them the rest of the week!). However, this Monday is a US holiday so volume should be thin from 7 EST on. Any suggestions on this? Will London open be worth waking up for Monday or will it be flat because of US holiday as well?

Hi,

Thank you for all the support and improvements done in this thread.  What started out like a simple idea, has now turned into a real winner.  Sorry, got a lot of work that take most of my online/trading time away lately.

I thank NiceGuy, EllisEdi, pgpb, Indrek, losingtrades, Fokusnik, chrisyeap, among others (cant mention all  , but you know who you are), and hope to summarize things in Post #1 again.  I plan like to update Post #1, for newcomers (as well as for me), to further simplify things, and be consistent WINNERS!

@pgpb, Indrek, does it mean we dont need the MTF indicator if we use this SuperTrend indicator?
SuperTrend nrp mtf.mq4 (nrp means Non-RePainting?)
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=692

@EllisEdi, how does 4BARS-MTF-NLMA 2.mq4 differ from the first version please?
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=691

@NiceGuy, if not too much to ask again, can you please list down what indicators are you using.

Btw, nice thoughts here, NiceGuy, and I quote:

I love trading GBPJPY usually, but because of spread, it seems this method works best on the majors -  EU, GU, UJ, and UC.

Some questions, if I may, I am a bit lost with the nice improvements here, plus the fact I was out of the loop for a few weeks ...

How does the Coral, ALF, and the NLMA goes in hand in hand now?  I mean if we have all these lines at the charts, it might give us the "analysis paralysis" syndrome?   hehehe

The arrows is based on the NLMA-mtf right?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi iamnoel

The RED/YELLOW dotted line is simply the Coral indicator

The Schaff indicator is to refine entries and exits.

I have not tested it in live trading, but I was rather impressed by it when I was reading about it in this thread

MTF Schaff Trend w/ Alerts

It may be "overkill" as the arrow (from the NLMA MTF indi) does give really good entries.....I am considering it for exits......the guy who runs the thread on this indicator says that you would stay in the trade until the indicator starts coming up from the 10 (or 25 level)

...anyways....as I say....until I can test it in live trading I am not sure whether or not I will keep it.

PGPB

--- 帖子 #717 ---
For me the NLMA MTF indicator is still totally mandatory, in back testing I noticed that the combination of 240 - 15 Supertrend nrp indicators kept me out of some bad trades, but it also kept me out of some good trades also, so I am mostly abandoning it. (the higher time frame info is there on the NLMA MTF indi)

I tend to add indicators, but then discard them in preference for simplicity.

The idea of adding in higher time frame SuperTrend confirmation came from this thread   Multiple Trading systems gbpusd only

Forme the best set up is NLMA MTF indicator with Coral, nothing else.

Adding in other indicators can help at time show me visually, but the long term trend is there in the NLMA MTF indicator.

The one missing peice that an indicator can never provide is chart time.

NG has discussed this in many of his posts, why he took certain trades and avoided others.....this is chart time/experience.....learning to read price action. I know in my evolution as a trader I have sometimes tried to fill this missing gap with indicators......it never works.....price action/chart reading is a skill that takes a bit of time.....but it is not brain surgery.....it can be learned.

PGPB

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Agreed on this. Combined with the Coral the MTF NLMA is a powerful combo for me. I think anyone can make money by trading this combo only. But still we need a proper MM and a discipline to support this system in order to succeed.

Trading is about probability. No matter what system do you use, in the end you always have to choose between Up or Down. Buy or Sell. If you see or get caught up when these two things are mixed up in a day, get out and stay away! Comeback another day. Dont revenge the market. You might be succeed doing it once in a while but soon you will realize that this activity will ruin your long term discipline.

As long as you keep earn bigger when you are right and lose smaller when you are wrong, you are on the right track. That's all. Dont make it any harder for yourself.

All in all...This system is only half of your key to success, you need a proper MM, a good mental attitude and discipline to complete the other half. Now, It really sounds like a work.... well it is.

Remember the old saying..... SYSTEM WORKS BUT TRADERS FAILED.

NG

PS:

I am done with the technical stuff.

But still I  know that some of the new guys still failed to trade this profitably because you guys entering too many

revenge trades on a ranging market or simply forcing yourself to take too many different signal everyday.

That's exactly where the traders failed. You have to be patience and have a discipline

That's why I keep writing this non technical stuff in last couple of posts.

^Thanks, thanks - pgpb, NG!

Should be able to squeeze in some charts time this week.

Quick question.

I got my charts set up, and this is how it looks.  GY, m15

http://i55.tinypic.com/j7t9bk.jpg

1.  Arrow A

Is this one of the few cases where we have our 20-25 SL gets hit?

2.  Arrow B

Nice trend up

3.  Arrow C

Bad entry?  As PA is quite far from NLMA already?

4.  Arrow D

Not a safe entry as CORAL is flat?

Or is it a perfect entry, as small PA candle, PA just crossed over CORAL?

BTW, we have updated Post #1

a.  NonLagMA

b.  THV Coral

c.  Pivot Point (deleted already, not sure how to use it  )

d.  Market Price (helpful to let you see the PA immediately, personal preference)

e.  4BARS-MTF-NLMA

Of course, we'd appreciate if you guys can rate this thread, if you find it useful.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hi Iamnoel, Thank you for the great thread. The 4BARS-MTF-NLMA 2.mq4 version uses less bars for calculation so it uses much less computer resources. I have run it side by side with the older version and the signals are the same. Sometimes there will be boxes missing. Just go to the next higher time frame and then back again to refresh it.

The arrow is formed when the three shorter time frame boxes turn the same color. When all four boxes agree it is possible to use a wider stop loss and stay in the trade longer.

I also keep an RSI 6 on the chart to check for divergence.

I also use the i-STO-Div-Sig.mq4 divergence indicator that was posted on the ALF Revisited thread at http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3844980 . It gives great confirmation signals and even stand alone signals. I colored the down arrows black and the up arrows blue.

There are:

- pgpb

- Syahmi

- LosingTrades (I still hate your nickname.... )

- EllisEdi

- and Many more to list here

... who keep coming back here to this thread and share us their opinion, thoughts and question that keeps building this strategy to where it is now...

I think I've done all I can for this strategy. It's time for me to bow out and give my focus more for trading. But I will keep checking on this thread in case something new and interesting come up in the future.

You guys are fantastic...

Just remember that we are here together to develop a forex system to make money. But it's going to be hard to make money if we keep developing this and that and forget to do our main job..... which is trading.

So...here is my current trade with UJ M15, first signal just before London.

I only use 10 pips for SL and aimed for 30 pips.

I prefer to lose that 10 pips if this trade decide not to gave me 30 pips.

All in all in total... I am 150 pips away to triple my USD 300 accounts so far...

So keep trading guys, and good luck!

May you all live a prosper life

Thanks NG for your support. Can anybody explain when does the arrow appear logically. Thanks

--- 帖子 #726 ---
The boxes at the bottom of the chart are the status of the 21 period nonlag ma for 4 time frames.

NG  has his chart set up so that the boxes go from long time frame at the top to short time frame at the bottom.  That is the default.

The red arrow appeared because the boxes showing the 3 shortest time frames were all red.

This is a really great MTF indicator.

Hi thanks for this wonderful system, and RR3:1 is really good base on small PA for entry filters out a lot of false signals but i lose out some good trades too cause PA is big.

Niceguy I guess u are doing well so far thats great,so whats your average RR on GBPUSD and what is the minimum/maximum stoploss you use for it since its more volatile than most other pairs and which pairs are your favorites.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #730 ---
One thing I notice, to avoid false breaks, I always follow the arrow IF the the NLMA is in the same direction.

I just can stand to see you guys still losing...

Check this one...

GU M15 on Tokyo today

Attached Image

The only way to answer all your question is to trade this strategy with demo for a certain periods... like maybe for 2 weeks or better for a month... learn how the candle moves betwen S/R, Coral and the NLMA. You have to learn it and not just seeing it... This is a business, you guys have to pay a lot of attention if you dont want to lose your hard earned money...

Patience, discipline and dont push your luck. If you got stop out too much on London or NY move your trade to Tokyo... The volatility is more friendly there. Once you can afford the bigger SL move back to London and NY.

There's no easy way to earn money in Forex. We just have to learn from our past mistakes, practice and keep trading....

This is where PGPB said is true... Screentime will save you from a lots of bad trades...

Dont give up guys!

Sorry about posting again but would really like your experience as a gauge. i am having really good entries from the tokyo sessions and really 3:1 rr is giving me good returns. But i tend to miss out on bigger trends,cause sometimes the tokyo session can already give me a healthy 60 pips and i would like to practice more in the london NY sessions. so i would really like to know roughly 1. how far from the coral will u not trade? 2.how much must the PA move within to be a valid entry?

--- 帖子 #733 ---
How Smal is small?

It really depends on your bankroll and how much you are willing to accept as a loss.... . I have opened a tiny account of USD 300. I risk 5% for every trade and that means 15 pips for 0.1 lots. But once I move this strategy to my regular account I have to figure out different MM to suit this strategy.

1. how far from the coral will u not trade? 2.how much must the PA move within to be a valid entry?

I dont have a certain "number of pips" as valid answer to this because I have to see the whole picture of Price Action on a day to make decision to enter the trade.  I know some of you guys demand a certain answer for this but I really dont have one. Sorry. I guess this is where that "screentime" comes to play.

....But i tend to miss out on bigger trends,cause sometimes the tokyo  session can already give me a healthy 60 pips and i would like to  practice more in the london NY sessions.

If I already have 60 pips on tokyo, I would shut down my computer and go out riding my bike or fool around with my friends or playing mini soccer with my kids on my backyard and come back another day to trade the same signal at the same time everyday.....

Hope this helps

It's my country's public holiday, so I decide to trade today.  It's 8.30 eastern time now.  I saw an arrow with candle crossed the coral line, I short EU right after the arrow.  Put my stop 3 pips above the red arrow.  Put my trailing stop after 13 pips.  Nice little profit

Thanks to NiceGuy

Hello there,

Is there anyone can help to eliminate the 4 bars MTF to keep quiet during each time frame changing?  The sound is very annoying when we open multiple charts.  Changing the SendAlert to false does not help.  Please help.

Nice one!

As for me... this is my EJ M15 with 15 Pips SL (But just update the SL to the latest fractals... Secure me 10 pips so far and aimed for 60 pips...

Keep the pips comin....

PS: Next time when you see Arrow both on EU and UJ during tokyo, try hit EJ instead. EJ tend give you more pips.

Just closed out this trade with 60 pips.... a very healthy 1:4 Risk VS Reward ratio

I think I've found a good filter for our MTF.

I got it here:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=183801

I have to do more testing, but it works very good on M-15.

So far I checked and tested GBPUSD and GBPJPY, but I'm sure other currencies are gonna be just fine.

It is very simple: when you get the MTF-NLMA signal (three dots aligned) - take a look at the Trix Meter.

If the Trix Meter is the same color - open the trade. If it is not - wait until it becomes the same color. That's it!

This Trix Meter can be very helpful for the exiting too. If we're long, changing the Trix Meter to red can show the exit, if we're short - changing to blue can show the exit.

P.S. Empty Trix Meter's square shows that the Trix Meter has not been confirmed yet, so we have to wait until the square is full.

P.P.S. Guys, I forgot: in order the Trix Meter work, you have to have another indicator in your indicators' folder - smSuper TRIX_v.1

Sorry about that! Please get this indicator here:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post4025642

--- 帖子 #738 ---
The circles show where to enter. The first five circles show that both the arrow and the Trix meter are white, the last circle - both the arrow and the Trix Meter are red.

because the incoming London open...

Nice Guy,

On your last chart, it appears that you entered your sell order during the candle, right after it went through the candle. Is that correct?

On your previous trade, it appears you entered on the candle with the arrow on it. If so, was that because you saw momentum in a certain direction and it was going through the coral?

These are both issues of chart time. I understand that. Just curious about your entries on these.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
I wanted to enter on first arrow, but the candles was still a bit "far" from coral, so I waited until there's a good momentum  to go south to confirm my entry. When I see another red arrow and a big candlebreak the low  passing the coral I entered on progress.

NG

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi Fokusnik, I have seen you posted 4 bars version 1.03 and 1.01 before.  Which is working correctly?

In the mean time, I witness trix definately confirmed green if 4 bars is green, which means in this case, the trix indicator is redundant?

Dear All..

Just finished triple-ing my USD 300 accounts with this strategy. So it's best time to study my trading statistic...

Here's the best pairs to trade based on my trade experience so far:

BEST PAIR TO TRADE:

TOKYO:

GU

EJ

LONDON:

EU

GU

EJ

NY

EU

UJ

Some notes:

- When you have same arrow both for UJ and EU, EJ will give you more pips.

- When you have same arrow both for GU and UJ, GJ will give you more pips.

-When you have different arrow for GU and EU (very rarely) , Take EURGBP with EU direction.

Please keep in mind that this is only 2 months experience I've been through with this strategy so far. From my humble experience I notes that Pairs volatily pattern tends to  be different across the year. So this data migh not work several weeks from now.

I didn't trade  GBPJPY, well maybe... not yet, because the spreads is account killer for me with my current broker (FXPro). Do you guys have any suggestion for a good broker that offer 3 pips (or bellow) for GBPJPY on Tokyo?

FYI, I trade only GU and EJ on Tokyo for now.

I hope this will be useful for you.

I will study this strat over weekend and demo next week.

Hi chrisyeap!

I think both versions are good. I returned to this system after a little while and started from the very beginning , so right now I use 1.01. I don't think 1.03 is better or worse.

About 4 bars: you have to remember that the arrows appear and DISAPPEAR! The arrows that show good, solid signals stay, but other arrows disappear, it happens when the bars repaint and it happens often! So on the history you see only the GOOD signals, and almost all of them are confirmed by the Trix Meter.

But we work in real time. How do we know whether this arrow stays or disappears? How do we know whether the four or three bars will repaint or not? That's why we need a good confirmation and this Trix Meter is the best confirming tool I found so far.

By the way if you look at the M-15 GBPJPY on September 10 you can see that the 11:00 signal was not confirmed (although there were 4 blue bars), but the next signal was confirmed at 11:45. It is just a small example that you can see even on the history - the Trix Meter is not redundant!

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Indrek, this indicator works as how Fokusnik described it here? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=740

Hi Fokusnik...

I havent tried the Trix yet, how does it perform for you... I mean does it repaints like the MTF NLMA?

Yes, I just found out that I lost exactly 47.83 %  of all the trades I entered. I am glad that I have enough discipline to keep on playing with at least 1:2 RR ratio. This discipline has earned me 1035 Pips from trading this strategy in almost two months. I didn't trade everyday, if I did I might do better (or worse).

If there's a way to reduce this lost percentage, I am in....

Btw, If you guys keeping track with the cart I posted from about last 2 months in this thread, I bet you will see that I keep on entering almost identical winners trades everytime. There's a pattern that I keep on following but I am still cooking something to explain it best for you. I found it difficult for me to explain something that only exist in my head.... I know that pattern when I see one, but somehow it's just so hard to explain it to other person...

Btw, I am using version 1.03 of MTF NLMA indi, I tried the latest version (V.2) but somehow with this V.2 I have to reload it too often just to get the right color reading. Missed out some really good trade with this version...

With V.1.03 I only need to reload the indy once for every pair everytime I opened the MT4.

Iamnoel

You need to have smSuper TRIX_v1.ex4  installed in your indicator folder.

You don't need to have it on the chart, just in your folder.

I will guess that will help.

However.....I am not seeing any advantage to having MTF Trix **and** MTF nonlag......to my eye they are showing the same thing.

I do wish someone would remove that 30 minute time frame bar on MTF-NLMA, I think 15, 60, 240 is good....that 30 minute bar is not necessary....IMHO

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Iamnoel, yes, pgpb is right - that will help!

--- 帖子 #757 ---
NiceGuy, I'm very glad that I found the Trix Meter, it works just fine. It doesn't repaint. It can change the color during the current candle, but it does not happen often, and when the candle is closed, it doesn't change the color.

The current square can be either full or empty. When you see the full square during the current candle, this color doesn't change (the full square means that it has been confirmed, that's why it doesn't change the color). The empty square during the current candle can change the color sometimes, but it is no big deal, happens not very often.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
I respectfully disagree. They are showing the same thing on the history, but we work in real time, and in real time MTF nonlag repaints and the Trix Meter doesn't.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
NiceGuy, I suppose you're doing better than 97% of the traders. But of course, if we can improve the system, we'd better improve it!

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi Fokusnik..

I just tried the trix Indrek posted on post 714. It surely look so damn beautiful....

Well, Honestly  I am not sure that I can do better than 97% of traders that's just too much for me...

I just believe that many traders (especially the new one) are failed not because of the system they use but mostly they failed to hold the rules and discipline. The lack of patience and willingness to learn in new traders usually encourage them to revenge the market too soon. I know that because I was there too.

FYI (especially for new traders here), I stop trading for the day whenever I lost my 15 pips SL and come back another day. Always picture yourself as a sniper not an infantry strike squad. You guys only in for the kill.  If we lost 1 bullet, we should wait for another perfect opportunity to strike and not desperately charging the enemy with rage...

PS:

- Thanks for Fokusnik, Indrek, and of course Mr Swingman (wherever you are) to come up with this filter. I will try it soon in tokyo.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
The indicator I posted is just another version of Trix that I use in my everyday trading. I prefer histogram version with arrows and alerts because this is one of my main indicators and I need to notice every signal.

There are different versions of Trix available in FF and MTF Trix thread. It is the matter of taste, which one to use.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Interesting....I will take another look, I was just looking historically.

I was not sure if you are using MTF Trix meter 15 minute and also 60 minute....or are you just using the 15 minute as a confirmation/filter?

When I load your template I see just just the 15 minute, but in the list of indicators I am seeing the 60 minute

It is indeed very useful, NiceGuy.

One point of clarification, if I may, you said "When you have same arrow both for GU and GJ, GJ will give you more pips."   Is there a typo here, or you really meant GU and GJ, then take GJ?

Btw, form what I know, IBFX spread on GJ can go as low as 4.2 pips.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
As the arrow appears after the candles are formed, does it follow that  we enter right at the next candle when the arrow appeared?

Hi Guys just would like to share something  for those that are afraid that might over trade i came out with a strategy that works pretty well i wont say it can double your account but the odds are pretty good.

i trade the tokyo session and i use fxpro and i dont take any trade after 11am on my platform

max 2 tries and no more

15 sl and 40 tp

i manage to catch 335 pips in aug currently 300pip till 17 sept

although there are quite a few times which the price got to 300 pips and reverse to my sl but i think the odds are pretty good  i trade from Beijing so i have a lot of time to do other stuff in the day

but sometimes i really feel a bit of pain seeing profit trades turn to s/l...

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Yes and thanks Nice Guy and to the founder of PM forex, cause i really have been losing and unsure in the forex until i found this thread, at least i manage to get a bit consistent and discipline in my trading now, and made me realize u dont win every day,you need a month of discipline trading to get results

cheers guys love you all

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Yes.... I mean GU and UJ have the same Arrow, GJ will give you more pips...

I will fix the post right away...

--- 帖子 #770 ---
This is a feedback that I am looking for. I really glad that my input and this whole threads can build some confidence in you and many new traders. I was there man... I know exactly what you've been through. That's one reason why I keep on posting here. To help new traders like the way seniors traders here in FF help me out before when I was green.

Btw.. here's the proof that I did not win everyday...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

First Trade..

GU M15: I scored 20 pips. 20 pips ? Yes.. I ussually put more TP in but for today, Judging by the way the PA  move in H4, I predict the GU will continue climbing after hitting the FPV (Pivots). I was right. I nailed 20 pips.

Second Trade:
EJ M15: This is the price I have to pay for being a naughty boy. I was late to enter the trade because somehow I feel something is not right when the arrow is coming. I should've stay away, but I got tempted by the next big red arrow below coral. I entered a late trade and aimed for 30 pips with 18 pips SL. But Price hit me back after It goes down for about 20 pips and eat my SL.

Today, I leave my trade after I entered them. I have to be some place else when this whole thing happened.

Win 20 pips and and giving up 18 pips SL today.....

Oh well...I will come back tomorrow....

NG

--- 帖子 #771 ---
nice 25 pips, but i realised sometimes the signals are slow is it me or this is normal like the second signal the arrow is at the doji but the alert and the arrow appeared later

--- 帖子 #772 ---
by the way the arrow at the doji only appeared after the 3 bullish candle appeared

--- 帖子 #773 ---
NG, you are using FXPro? Does it need min. 3000 to open an account?

FXPro offers quite good anyway.

Well... I'm using Ava. It offers 7 pips for GJ. Yea... crazy huh! >.<

My friends suggested to use Ava, because it just need US$ 100 to open an account. But I'm looking for other broker with good offer as well.

W

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Nope.. I remember that I opened an account there with only USD 500 minimum, but it was few years ago. I am an old timers with FXPro.

Btw, I am not exactly open a new account, I already have 2 different account in FXPro, one for my regular account with five digits $$$ accounts in it and another old account for testing purpose which I already have about USD 389 inside it.

I dont trade my regular account too often now. Lately, I fiind it's quite fun and less stressfull  to mess around with small account like I am doing it right now. It's nice to see them grow slowly, you know... making big bucks with less investement is really a satisfying goals to achieve....

FXPro give me 5-6 pips in tokyo for GJ...If you guys can recommend me a good broker with better spreads.. I might be interested..

thanks

NG

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Have you checked IBFX?  I think IBFX spread on GJ can go as low as 4.2 pips.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Thanks IamNoel, I will check them out...

Btw, Still got some PM regarding my post here...

So I will repeat it again here...

To any of you who are new to this strategy, try to demo or better if you open an account with only USD 30 or 40 inside it or spare this amount from your Mini Account. Trade this strategy with 5% risk every trade. It means if you are using 0.01 mini lots, you have 15-20 pips SL and 20 entry. These 20 entry is your coin to play the game. So try not to lose it too often.

Trade on Tokyo with the first signal you see, I personally recommend GU or EJ these days. Use 15-20 pips with 40 pips TP (like daemonw suggest) or bigger. Do the same thing everyday and dont trade on other Market Time. Keep your trade near Coral (if you decide to use this Indi).

See it for yourself. You will learn a lot more on the way than just reading this strategy.

I really recommend to use very small live account rather than using demo accounts for new traders. It will help you to build your mental attitude and discipline in trading. This you can not achieve by trading Demo account.

We are Human, sometimes we have to suffer something first in order to force ourself to learn....

pgpb, so far I trade M-15, I created the indicator for H-1 just in case I want to try H-1. Probably I'll try the H-1 next week.

I trade M-15: when I get the MTF-NLMA signal on M-15 I take a look at the Trix Meter on M-15, if they are the same color - I enter at the next M-15 candle. So far it worked just fine. Maybe I'm just lucky, maybe it is because I trade only GBPUSD and GBPJPY, maybe it was just a good week, maybe it is because I trade only active hours (starting 1-2 hours before London Open), but so far so good!

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Yes, that's right!

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Now, as I promised earlier, I will share to you guys a secret...

This pattern repeat itself over and over again. This is where I scored more than 50 pips in a day. Just did yesterday with EJ and scored me 60 pips.

This why exactly the reason why I only trade TOKYO lately, it's simply because the strong movement usually start on NY lately and at beginning of tokyo they start to range. So I take the trade whenever I see a signal that breaks the range and score my pips there.

I will move my trade to follow this pattern and waited for the range periods to happen and score my pips with candle that break it to the opposite direction at the end of ranging times.

God... It's hard for me to explain this.... Hope this picture will make you clearer...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

There will be variation to this pattern but if you get the idea the rest will be  much clearer.

This pattern is repeating itsel over and over again. This is my trade filter. I scored about 80% succesful trade and get away with more than 50 Pips because of this.  Pay attention when this kind of setup is being drawn on your chart.

Those big boys are  human. And Human mind tends to do the same thing and keep repeating it over and over again. If you happen not to have multi Trillion Dollars to trade and set the trend for yourself then all we have to do is follow them....

Hope this one can make you better trader.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Sure!

The semafor is a ZigZag-based indicator, so it repaints. But if you use it correctly, it can be very useful.

1). Never use it for the entry.

2). Use it for the exit only.

3). Use it together with Heiken-Ashi.

I changed my semafor settings:

Period1 0.0

Period2 0.0

Period3 18.0

This way the semafor doesn't show the local hi's and low's, it shows only the extreme hi's and low's.

It repaints, but I like it because it gives me the first signal:

Let's say I entered long on M-15 using PM and Trix. Let's say the currency went up. I wait until the very first semafor signal. When I get this signal, I take a look at the H-1. If there is no semafor signal on the H-1 at this moment, that usually means that the M-15 trend is close to the end, so I'd better take my profit. So I go back to M-15, wait until the candle's end and exit.

But if the H-1 also has the semafor signal - that usually means that the trend is pretty good. The semafor on H-1 usually repaints 2-3 times, sometimes 5-6-10 times. So I decide to stay on the H-1 and watch. This time I watch not the semafor, but the Heiken-Ashi. When I see that Heiken-Ashi becomes much smaller - I exit.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
hi just wanted to ask if there is any setting problem, because i got a buy alert today for GU on the 15 min today during tokyo session but when i looked at the chart the arrow was on third candle before current candle that just closed. i posted the picture in the earlier post 774,alert came after the long bulish candle but arrow was on the doji 3 candles before which is a perfect entry i would say.

is there anything causing this lag or is this normal? thanks cause i realised it happens quite often for me.

Dont use NLMA V2, use V1.03. And always reload the indi everytime you opened MT4. I got the same problem when I use v.2. The V 1.03 is a bit heavy for the PC but more reliable.

Simply double click on it at your indicator list will do the trick...

Btw.. If you guys decided to use coral as I suggested, the coral will also give you an early warning if the market is going into a ranging times like the picture below:

USD JPY M15, Yesterday after London, market range in 10-15 pips movement...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It's best to stay away from the market if you see this on your chart because rarely you will score many pips in this situation and oftenly your SL get hit too soon. This situation is usually happen at the end of trending periods. Look at how many arrow in the chart and how the Coral going flat accroes PA. This shows that Big Boys is having a fight with each other. Some of them already in to sell but some other still insist to buy. New trends will be form when one side is finally giving up or the other side push the market with puttin in bigger volume of money.

Be patience, enjoy the fight and dont revenge the market too soon when your SL got hit on the first trade. Sometimes it's best to wait for another day or at least another market open when new boys join the fight and choose their side ...

Hi just would like to contribute to this, repaint or not that is the problem that we will not be able to fix, but the only thing we can do is find some more evidence i will say to confirm the trade, i use thv 5 min to confirm the trade, so if i see that the trix is crossing up (green) and a short for 15min calls for a short i will not enter the trade.

like what they say when confluence happens it is like having a double A's in texas and i will kill myself if i have a pair ace in my hand and i dont bet, but again there might be a 3 of a kind or flush to wipe u out. same goes for this strategy. if you are discipline enough, with a 15 pips sl and 40tp. two trades a day before the london market should give good profits in the long term.

at the end of the day when Ace pairs comes out go for it.

good luck everyone!

Nice Guy,

Have you looked at Go Markets in Australia? They have very good spreads. Good place to do business.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
daemon, I have noticed the same thing about v1.03 suddenly putting an arrow 3 or 4 candles back. It is why I left this strategy at first. I came back to it though because the information the PM is giving is good information. Sometimes, you have to read the PA versus the coral, pivots, and s/r lines. I have been in these spots and thought, "why am I not seeing an arrow right now?". Guess what happens 2 candles later....the arrow shows up! Read the PA, that is what you are trading. As some are fond of saying, chart time is huge. If the trix was right on that chat you posted before, I would have gone to the m5 or m1  to verify direction, then taken the trade if PA was acting logically.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Thank you, Nice Guy, for the Dolly Trading Times indicator.  I like the uncluttered look--very appreciated.  Mel

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Yes I have. I am interested to open an account with Go Markets. But they rejecting people from my country, and some other country in my continent to do business with them. That's just too bad.

Guys... It's the PA that drive the indicator not the other way around, so the Indicator is only act as a confirmation for your action. Like it or not we still need to read PA to see what's really going on. Honestly, I am also kind of expecting to have some kind of indicator to yell at me... SELL... BUY...SELL...BUY and it's right more than 75% of times without even see the chart... But I haven't find one yet. Even if we have one, I bet we will also looking for a second indicator to confirm the first indicator, and suddenly we add another third indi to confirm both of them...so on and on... Come on guys... Even George Soros has his losers too... a Million Dollars one.... You should have an Ace not only in your mechanical system but also in your Money Mangament and your RR ratio.

It's the Logic behind the PM strategy that gives me a confidence to trade this strategy. In many situation PM System allowing you to Sell or Buy at the very beggining of a long trending periods.  I bet many of you who already trade this strategy oftenly had a "Shit! I should have ride that one longer....!" sentence in your head. Me too....

So keep risking low, and aim high guys... Or at least do what daemonw do.. 15 SL and 40 TP. He already scored 600 pips so far by doing the same thing everyday... Trade small and longer... let your account grow...

As for me... I will try something different next week. I will enter as many trade as I can during a day. But I will stop trading for that day whenever I have 1 loser on me. I will try to discipline myself to always aim for 45 TP with the 15 SL as usual. I will keep on going as long as I dont have loser on my side.  I might have 2 or 3 or hopefully more winners but I will always only have 1 loser in a day as usual. Start on tokyo tomorrow.

Because there is always a day that I keep on winning with everthing I entered into the chart. I have some of that days in near past experience. I bet you guys too. This way I think I can accomodate that Angel of Fortune whenever he deicide to visit me.

Guys, I understand that the repainting could be very frustrating.

But this MTF's repainting is NATURAL! We can't do anything about that.

If you don't want to see these appearing and disappearing (and misleading) arrows - don't use MTF, use NonLagMA itself!

It is much easier than you think and I will probably switch to the NonLagMA next week.

I see it this way:

We put the NonLagMA (21) on M-15, M-30, H-1 and H-4. It has 2 colors, red for short and white for long.

We watch M-15 and check it every 15 minutes.

When the NonLagMA starts changing color (let's say, from red to white), we have to wait until this M-15's candle is closed. So, the candle is closed and the NonLagMA is white now.

Then we go to the M-30. If the NonLagMa is red - we do nothing. If it just started changing from red to white, but the M-30 candle isn't closed, we wait. When it is closed and it is white - that means, that two timeframes aligned. And, of course, if we go to M-30 and we see that the current NonLagMA is white and the previous candle' NonLagMA's also white - that means the same: two timeframes aligned.

Then we check the same way H-1. If three timeframes aligned this way - it is a good signal and we should enter. We can take a look at H-4 too, but if it is not aligned - I would enter anyway (of course, you have to make sure that M-15 and M-30 are still white). And, of course, if we're lucky and all 4 timeframes aligned - it is an excellent signal, we can enter with bigger than usual lot.

Some of us think that M-30 doesn't matter. I don't think so, but if you do - check only M-15, H-1 and H-4, the only difference: at this case two timeframes aligned is a good signal and three timeframes aligned is an excellent signal.

Of course, after all this checking I will check the M-15's Trix Meter too - for me it is the ultimate filter.

I understand that it sounds like a lot of work. But:

1). It is not that hard to take a look at 2-3 charts every 15 minutes

2). Even if it is a lot of work - it is not as bad and frustrating as seeing the disappearing arrows

3). If we want to make money - we have to work, just that simple!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Yes, I Agree fokusnik... It's nice that you put it that way. Well this whole thing is a work... a job to do. We have to do the effort to achieve something.

Btw... How do you set TF inside your trix meter? Let's say if we want trade M15? Does it need to be set also in M15? I got mine with 5 TF as default....

Thanks

NG

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Thats why i still prefer asian time, due to the gentle price movement i dont see much repaint haha infact the signal that was repainted for the long was early and that gave me an early entry before the confirmed long signal came out haha maybe just lucky

--- 帖子 #797 ---
NiceGuy, you're right, having the right Trix Meter's settings is very important!

I'm not sure whether we can set one Trix Meter to work on different timeframes. So I created one Trix Meter for M-15 and another one for the H-1.

For M-15 I set "TimeFrame" to 15, then I went to "Visualization" and checked only M-15.

For the H-1 I set "TimeFrame" to 60, then I went to "Visualization" and checked only H-1.

If I need M-30, I'll create another Trix Meter with TimeFrame 30 and Visualization M-30.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
daemonw, on the one hand you're probably right, it doesn't repaint so badly during the Asia.

But on the other hand - most of the strong movements happen after London open and NY open, and we need the strong movements to make more pips...

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Sure you can have MTF Trix on the same chart.

you can either have the histogram MTF or the blocks or a hybrid

I have charts with the 15 minute histogram trix, and then underneath the 60 and 240 minute blocks trix

We have Indrek to thank for that method, and also a forexfactory member named Gleneagles
http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=2209

Check out his posts for some really good MTF trix trading.

See this thread   http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=183801   for a system

Attached is a chart showing a 5 minute trix histogram with a 15 minute and 60 minute trix blocks indicator on the same chart

Of course you can have a 15 minute and 60 minute TRIX and also the NLMA indicator all on the same chart also.

Also attached is a chart with a 5 minute histrogram trix and a 60 minute historgram trix

The combinations of trix, and NLMA are endless.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
pgpb, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I just noticed that Gleneagles is back on Forexfactory, and Indrek is active at times also.

...both of them will have lots of valuable stuff to say about MTF Trix trading.

Of course to get the  TRIX blocks all in one window you set the line height

I like to have the lowest time frame at the top

Here is a chart with NLMA at the top and MTF Trix at the bottom (5, 15, 60, 240)

--- 帖子 #802 ---
You have made it too complicated. If you set the timeframe to "0" then it shows always the current timeframe. So, you do not have to attach it separately for every timeframe.

Another choice would be to attach Trix for different timeframes on the main chart that you trade from. Then you do not have to switch between timeframes.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Indrek, thank you very much!

What can I say? We live and we learn!

And it is so great that there are nice people who're willing to teach us, like Indrek, pgpb, iamnoel, NiceGuy, Gleneagles!

--- 帖子 #805 ---
It is, of course, up to everyone's decision but I see no point in using MTF Trix and MTF NonlagMA in parallel. Both belong to MA family, so would be logical to use one of them. Otherwise, the system is overloaded with unnecessary information. 2-3 indicators is max for one system, after that must come discretion.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
I agree that there is no point in using MTF Trix and MTF NonlagMA in parallel.

NonLagMA (21) shows good results, but MTF NonLagMA repaints badly. If I could find the Trix Meter settings that make the Trix Meter behave similar to NonLagMA (21), I would work only with the Trix Meter. Unfortunately, it is a very big IF, so for now I would stick with the Trix Meter as a filter and NonLagMA (21) - I mean the NonLagMA itself, not MTF.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
You have to read my thread. It is full of information and different versions of MTF Trix indicators. I do not find it appropriate to start discussing this stuff here, or this thread would turn into a copy of MTF Trix thread

But what I know exactly is that Trix 3,1,1,1,0 gives quicker entries than NonlagMA20 or 21.

I still trade with Trix but using only two timeframes instead of MTF. I find any MTF indicator too lagging.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Indrek, thank you!

I already started reading your thread, I'm sure that would be very helpful!

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Yep, I confirm that. Thanks Indrek... I will stick with NLMA and this Coral thing... I am doing just fine with that already.

Dont forget guys, there are 2 things that usualy move the market strongly in a regular day...

1. A market open, when that new boys is waking up and put in their money

2. The News.

We should also stick our nose to these stuff and not just relying on mechanical trading blindly.

I think if we use this indi we can predict. "will it repaint or not!"

And sometimes it also give us a good idea to close our trade.

Happy trading everybody

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Yes... You are getting along so well in this Strategy. I am glad. Keep it up!

As for me, I got only 18 pips from the same trade. I waited the candles to break the latest low before closing in.

(There is technical problem with the website prevent me to upload my screen)

If I risk 15, and I aim for let's say 45, and my trade hits 40 but it failed to go more than that, I think 30 pips would be my first choice to close in and get out. This way I still maintain a healthy 1:2 RR. But  if I decide to wait a bit longer because I still see that there is still signs that the price will retrace back and unfortunately I am wrong... 15 pips would be my last stop to get out. I will not tolerate more. This way I still have 1:1 RR on my side, and my next trade will be financed with my previous winner.

Btw, I also have another trade with EJ and EU which I also close out early like the  GU. Each of them give me 20 pips. Then I risk another 15 with GU just before london and got stop out for -15 pips. So... I scored 43 pips for today. I have my loser so I stop trading for today.

Well... this looks really interesting...

Good trading everbody!

actually i am thinkingi if a trailing of 30 pips is good for cases like today, cause i would usually just in into the trade in walk out, so either 40 or -15

but i will lose out on trades that hit 30 plus and pulls back... but at the same time i am afraid the market have moved like 30 plus pips move back to break even and then to 40 tp..... ai... i am very confused how should i manage my trade sometime... but 40tp/15sl still get good profits if u just go in blindly just two tries a day

Guys... I really need your help on this...

I got that beautiful indi from good people here in this thread. We can set it up so It shows the market open times in a simple vertical lines. I think this indi is one of those important indi we should have on our chart.

As we all know, trends are usually being defined by the end of a market times and the open of the new one. That's where those big boys starting up their screen and make a decision where they want to put their money in. Please see how the trends are being defined exactly on market open in last 24 hours and see also that's where exactly the arrow from MTF NLM showed up. This is also one of a pattern that repeating itself overtime

The only problem I have with this indi is I have to wait to see this lines to be drawn in time. That's bad, because sometimes we have to add more discretion and make our decision just before the next market will open so I want these lines to stay on my chart.

Anyone care to help me out here?

Btw, that's my latest trade with GU on tokyo today you see on the right side of the screen. Up for 23 pips by now...

Good trading everybody!

hey NiceGuy regarding a late arrow signal do  still take it?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Again... you guys should pay more attention to this...

This is Gold.

The same pattern repeated itself as post 783 and post 821:

GU M15

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Shit! I am faster than the arrow...

Remember guys, You trade the PA not just the indicator. Because the Indi is there to help you reading the chart. We should study the co-relation between the indi that we use and the PA. It is always the PA who drive the Indi and not the other way around.

If you ask me whether should we take a late arrow...?

Do this:

1. Look  and measure the distance between current PA with the proper place to put your stoploss. A trade deserves a proper stoploss. If you trade M15, the best place for Sl is at latest 1H H/L, second best is at the H/L candle with arrow.

2. Ask yourself, are you ready to take that loss? Does you MM support that kind of Loss?

If yes, take it, otherwise leave it... there will be another opportunity to score pips later. Be patience.

As for me... I scored 23 pips on tokyo and another 30 pips just now as you see on my chart. Take a look both of the trades has the same pattern. Up for 53 pips for today and no loser. I am in for the next trade. See you guys on NY...

I've been experimenting with few Trailing EA like THV Cavemanager, SwissArmy and trailing stop by fractal to trail the Order. But I just dont find the best solution yet. These EA tends to close the order to fast and prevent me to hit the maximum profit.

I wonder if you guys can refer me a Trailing Stop EA that keep jumping the SL every 15-20 pips. Like when we hit 30, it will jumps the stop loss to +15 and when we hit 45 it will jump the SL to +30 so on... or something like that. This way I can make sure my trade are always have the same SL at every stage while securing more and more pips on the way.

It might sounds stupid but that's exactly my point. Trading the news.

I've been watching this strategy perform during the news, and the arrow on the start of news candles is very tempting. You can make 1:4 RR more easily you know ....

Well, at least that's worth to try. That was the second breakout after the news. Never know that the right one would be the third one.... Should've used smaller SL though.

btw, guys pls check out how the coral perform on london breakout today with GU M15. That coral thing seems to have somekind of a magnet to pull the price to it. That's just so awesome...

Hi Monmak! Thank you for sharing!

I totally agree that MP is much better than MTF. Yesterday I switched to 4BARS-MP-NLMA 1.01 (with 21, 42, 84, 336). It gave me a whole bunch of very good signals.

I have two questions:

1). What is the difference between your NLMA_MTF_v7.1 and the 4BARS-MP-NLMA 1.01 ?

2). They both have "ColorBarBack" setting. We've been told that if we set it to 0 - then 4BARS-MP-NLMA 1.01 wouldn't repaint. What about NLMA_MTF_v7.1? What is the right setting, 0 or 1?

Thank you!

Guys, 21, 42, 84 and 336 are the settings for M-15.

If you want M-30 or H-1, you need different settings.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Who is going to use MP, has to be aware that it gives much more false entries. Possibly needs bigger SL than just the high/low of the signal candle.

It is a tool for a good and aggressive trader who can read PA very well.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I agree! My SL is 50 pips and I use the Trix Meter and Heiken Ashi as filters.

50 pips when trading from m15 is a really aggressive and careless SL for most pairs  I usually use 25 pips for EU and 30 for EY on m15.

I haven't trade with this system yet. But when I'd test it with MTF, the alarm ring I entered then dots changed color, Arrow disappear after I saw it.

So could you please share your experience in that case

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Indrek, I trade GBPJPY, EURJPY, GBPUSD and GBPCHF and I often switch from M-15 to the H-1, so 50 pips is the least I can have, especially for GBPJPY and GBPCHF. I have smaller lots, in each trade (even with SL 50) I risk no more than 2% of my account.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
My experience says that any multi-period indicator is much more sensitive than MTF.

The correct way to use MTF is to wait until the signal has been confirmed on higher timeframes.

MTF is not repainting, it is just changing more than one bar for higher timeframes.

But it is really basic knowledge that has been shared in many places all over FF at least hundreds of times  I can only suggest that you test both of them during, let us say, one month. Then it should be clear.

Wow.. I dont wanna lose 50 pips in any trade. That's just too scary for my style..

Its'hard to arrange an MM with 50 pips SL for trading M15.  Basicly my SL always based in PA not in pips. If I can afford it, I would put my SL at the latest 1H H/L and only for this system I also put it in the back of candle with arrow. If I can not afford it I stay away... There is no point for me to lose more money...

I find myself to use 15 -20 mainly.. but sometimes 7-12 do the trick for pairs like UJ and EU during Tokyo.. Small SL make me easy to go on and on...

Well, it's a personal decision I guess. Just use whatever that works for you.

As for me...I lose many but still make way more money....

NG

PS: btw.. I grew 4 digits account to 5 digits doing this way...

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Yes, that is a matter of personal taste and style. I prefer to take 1-2 very carefully picked trades per day, so I cannot afford to be stopped out easily.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
NiceGuy, I agree, it is a personal decision!

But for me SL is an emergency stop, in case something really bad and unusual happens, so I won't lose 500-1,000 pips. I don't want the price to hit my SL, if I see that the price went against me, I usually exit with much-much smaller loss (10-15 pips) or even with a small profit.

Let's say we both have $3,000.00. You trade with 0.3 lot, if you lose 20 pips, you lose $60.00, that's 2% of $3,000.00. I trade with 0.12 lot (and I aim for bigger profit, at least 50-60 pips, and my pairs give me this opportunity), even if I lose by SL, that would be the same $60.00, the same 2%, but if I exit earlier losing only 20 pips, that would be only $24.00

Once again, you're right, it is a personal decision!

--- 帖子 #873 ---
hi guys back from my shopping and spa what a holiday. hmm there is something about a new indicator? is it better?

--- 帖子 #874 ---
As for me trading is game of probability. I try to work this probability to be more on my side. I use at least 1:1 RR, so my winners should be at least the same as SL. But I always aim at least three times of my SL. Many times I can score 1:4 RR with this PM strategy...

Like this:

Trading with 15 pips SL and aim for 45. In 10 trades even if I lose  7 times and only win 3 times.. I would still have 30 pips on my side. I like the idea for only have to be right 30% of all times and still make money..

So far I win about 60% of all trades and some of them with ridiculously 1:4 RR Ratio, most of them with 1:3 Ratio, some with 1:2 and only a very few of them with 1:1 RR ratio. I dont do part close.

Like the last trade I won with UJ, I use ridiculously 7 pips SL to win 21 pips... I like that kind of trade... Like paying a beer with a discount card, in a promotion times, at currently a discounted retail store... And I dont even bother to watch that trade... (...Well...honestly.. I was  preventing myself from looking at it. It's not easy to look at that red color as soon as I open that trade.. )

But that's just my personal trading style...

It might not suit everybody.

But I need to work more on my discipline...

anyone taking this trade if the arrow to long comes out for GU?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
daemonw, it is probably too early to take any trade, I usually start trading 1-2 hours before London Open.

But today I decided to try Tokyo. So it's gonna be a small test.

I went long EURUSD and GBPUSD. I decided not to trade GBPJPY (and EURJPY) right now because I don't like the USDJPY's outlook.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
haha i went in abit earlier when i saw the long arrow on the 1hr then the 15 min arrow came. anyway the tp for tokyo session might be longer but their price movement are more consistent  anyway trading tokyo sessions until i get better with this strategy

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Yes.. tokyo is a bit slower than other market times. But the movement is more consistent and predictable there. It also give you lot more time to make decision for your trade. Not like in other market times when you can get 20-30 pips shooting back at you in few second.

Shit you cheated!

Well.... me too.....

My entry is exactly like yours.....

hope this one going well...

Today I just turn a 30 pips winner into 8 pips loser...

GU M15
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I risk 15 pips and aim for 45 pips. I let the trade decide the result for me. Lucky me I Updated the SL to the latest fractal just after the EU open.

FYI, I am still live testing this Strategy and not yet trading it with the real deal. I keep playing around here and there. Try this and that with this system. Use many type of EA to trail the stop and putting in a stoploss. And something like that.

Tokyo signal with GU is really something.  Based on my experience 30 pips target is decent target since my winner on tokyo usually around that amount. You might want to put this target around the nearest S/R within 30 pips distance.

The nature of  PA movement in Tokyo enable us to put smaller SL like 15-20 pips. This way we still have 1:2 RR or 1:1,5 RR. Many times I tried to push my luck to get 1:3 RR but rarely I scored that amount.

See you guys in Tokyo...

Anyway today market is just ranging without the japs and the china peeps are enjoying their holiday. see how it goes again tomolo

Hi all,

does the NonLagMA indicator repaint? Because if it doesn't i think it's the best indicator i've ever seen!

How is it calculated?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
pgpb, it depends.

I think that M-30 is a valueble timeframe, so for M-5 I would have 21, 63, 126 and 252.

But if you don't want to check with M-30, then it would be:

1). 21, 63, 252 (for cheking with M-15 and H-1)

or:

2). 21, 63, 252, 1008 ((for cheking with M-15, H-1 and H-4)

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Thanks Fokusnik.......how do you calculate these numbers......I like to understand things.....just in case you get abducted by aliens or something

:-)

PGPB

--- 帖子 #895 ---
pgpb, let's say, we work on M-5 and want to check with M-15, M-30 and H-1.

M-5 will be 21 (the working timeframe must be 21, at least I think so).

15 is 3 times more than 5, so M-15 will be 21*3=63

30 is 6 times more than 5, so M-30 will be 21*6=126

60 is 12 times more than 5, so H-1 will be 21*12=252

P.S. I don't believe in alien abductions!

--- 帖子 #896 ---
iamnoel, I think the Trix Meter works much better when you trade currencies like GBPUSD, EURUSD, GBPJPY, EURJPY etc.

USDJPY has a very small daily range and it is not volatile enough IMHO.

And another thing: the Trix Meter works just fine during the active hours, but as all the indicators it screwes up during the passive hours.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
my first post on this thread.

could you please tell me what indicators i need to install in my chart and where they can be found. as there have been too many changes since your first post.

also, any updates to your method.

thanks

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Hi Fokusnik..

Yes.. it's true. The USDJPY is much less volatile than others but that's exactly the strenght of this pair. This pair allowed us to use less than 10 pips SL to work with. Many pairs is more volatile and we might earn more pips from them but dont forget that we also require more risk to work on them. As a trader, I think it is important for us to keep a decent RR across all trades in order to grow our account. As for me, I dont wanna trade anything with less than 1:1 RR, but that's just my taste.

I scored 42 pips in last 2 days straight with USDJPY trading just before NY and best of all... I use ridiculously 7 pips SL for each trade and aim for exactly 21 pips... That's 1:3 RR, and it's much easier to achieve than with other pairs. We still can push this RR to 1:4 and still it's much easier to achieve than with other pairs.

I already know that GU Signal during Tokyo is exceptional... and now I am also paying attention to trade USD JPY around NY.

Hello guys,

I am new to FF and currently trying to learn the PM forex strategy. I have read all the post here but maybe I missed this or what. I have a question which I attached a chart.

I was waiting the front candle to close abd after that the arrow appear 3-4 candles back? Is that a valid signal or we only wait till arrow appear on current candle close?

Really hope someone can advise me

--- 帖子 #901 ---
well that is a probelm usually 3 candles before, but u will have to judge it cause it will be good when the arrow comes out and u see the candle didnt more much from the previous price and closes after a S/R line.

Anyway ranging again in tokyo session -15 for today... better luck next week

By the way, anyone knows any members that knows chinese?

Fantastic...

I bet there was a line "Shit! Should've ride that a bit longer!" in you head after your trade was closed....

Btw... If you dont have a good reason to do so, please consider not to opening any position when the coral is flat like that. Could be dangerous next time because the market is ranging.Look how many arrow you got on your chart...

I am off from trading today. Busy with something else...

See you guys next week!

Have nice weekend.

For advanced user like you guys.. I think it's a good idea for you if you keep going whenever you are in a winning.

Like this, start on Tokyo with GU M15. Risk 15 Pips aim for 40 pips. If you win, risk half of it like 20-25 pips in london and aim to something like 40-50 pips. If you win again and you still see a good entry in NY then risk aother 20-25 pips and aim for another 40-50 pips. This is a good idea because whenever you are right, I think you will have a better vision about where the market  might go. You should stop whenever you have a loser. There will be a day when you complete all 3 trades and score in more than 100 pips a day and pays off all of the loss from previous day. This way even if you lose in the second trade or third trade, you still have extra pips form your previous winner  to finance your trading on the next day.

This goes a long well with an old saying in trading "Risk more when you win, and risk less (or in this case is stop trading) whenever you are in losing."

i try not to stare at the screen for too long now.... and i am not very good with this strategy yet better to stick with one currency and one session first until i get better cause i am sticking to two trades max a day so until i get better i will demo with the rest on other timing

just now sticking to one system, one currency one session  and one wining strategy might just evolve to one perfect lifestyle haha

from singapore?

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Yes, I took GBPJPY trade at this time and made 50 pips, and another 50 pips on GBPCHF. And after London Open I made 50 pips on EURUSD and 50 pips on GBPUSD.

Exactly! I could make 100-150 pips instead of 50!

However, guys, seriously: it was not some special day, with this system we can make these kind of profits almost any London Open. For me this combination (London-NY, NLMA-MP and the Trix Meter) works just fine!

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Good for you!

However, I'm not sure about staring at the screen:

I turned off all the signals that the MP has, but I was under the impression that both MTF and MP have some kind of the sound alert. So maybe you don't have to stare at the screen, just turn on the signal.

And if I'm wrong and the indicators don't have the sound alert, I'm sure it is very easy to add one.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
yup from singapore.. you too?

yups anyway i am not yet ready for multiple currencies yet haha better to be good at one first, yah i envy you guys that get 100pips a day very tempting but at last i get some discipline in one strategy and a trading plan so will do so when i can consistant haha.

Within a year i have switched from best 5 min scapling or one min scapling to thv to on and one and on bought a lot of stupid delphi scalper hmm can call it stupid cause i did earn around 600 pips in 2 weeks but lost it all due to ill discipline and of course a lot of here and there of course i believe the dance it good too but haha think i am not very confident about it yet like the story that he shared thou

Anyway i will be at a level with u guys with the way i trade now maybe we can go around the world to visit each other next time haha.

Is this where you entered, NG?  Missed both trades.  http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/sad.gif

Because the angle of the CORAL is not "good."  One question, the Coral is RED, and the arrow is GREEN.  Is the trade not dangerous?  Of course in hindsight, both trades are A-1!

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Precisely....

Small candle with arrow in the middle of the news... It already scream outloud.... TRADE ME!

If I lost it I only suffer 17 pips for both trade, but you can see in your chart how many pips that I won from both.... I played 1:10 RR  for this trade. This probability itself is already  good reason to enter the trade...

Remember that it's the news that drive the coral not the other way around...

Good for you...

Btw, if you roll it to the left on your chart and do a little study. I notice that putting your target on nearest S/R lines also might increase the hit rate. This S/R usually 20-40 pips away.

See those 30 pips winner turn into a loss is more painful than seeing the trades that went straight to SL.... Ouch!

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Hi guys....

How are you doing?

Are you guys still trading this strategy?

I do.

Keep collecting 30-40 pips during tokyo and sometimes lost it again for 15 pips... This strategy is one of the easiest way to make money in Forex. As long as you can control yourself for not over trading and revenge the market too soon, you are good...

Just enter the same arrow at the same market times you see everyday, leave it and get on with your life....

It's like picking money from the floor. Sometimes some of them are dropping again but most time you can collect them. But when you try to take more than what you need and overtrade, most likely you will drop them all again to the floor..

Control yourself and follow that arrow.

You'll be just fine.

Indicator NLMA-MTF - repainter!?

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Hi NG

I have a few questions:

Are you only trading the asian session?

What currencies do you trade?

Are you following the system as posted in page 1?

How many trades per sessiopn are you aiming for?

Thanks

WFX

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Yes, it repaints,  but as long as you understand how this happens, you would not have the problem.

Please understand this is the Multi-Timeframe indicator. It means,  except the lowest time frame,  the higher time frame read is not fixed yet at current candle.  For example, for the 00:00 bar, M30, H1 read is not fixed yet, subject to change later.  for 00:15 bar, when it is at close, M15, M30 fixed,  H1 is not, may change later.  And so on.

Hope it is helpful.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
If not then it's a Money Maker machine for free...

Yes, I only trade on Asian Session. But that's just my preference. Tokyo is at 7  O'clock in the morning my time. So I still have time for the rest of the day to do something more fun than trading forex. Many other trade London and also succesful too, but they just dont say it here.

I trade EU, EJ, GU and sometimes UJ. But I am focusing on EU the last few days because it's predictable movement.

I follow the arrow. If I like it the way it looks then I enter it, if not then I prefer to practice shooting target instead or riding my bike or play soccer with my boy in the backyard. I dont have to trade everytime I started the MT4.

I trade only once.  I can make USD 300, or 5000 or 35000 or even 100000 with just one trade then why do I need more? Forex is so boring, but I just have to do it because I need the money.

NG

--- 帖子 #955 ---
wow, very few people trade Asia session and even few trade successfully.  Thumbs up.

If you do not mind, can you share with us your weekly average trade count and your success rate?

I often encounter the false break during Asia session, how do you avoid it?  I know you are looking for small candle with Arrow. By small, do you mean its arbitrary range should less than 20pip or even it should be smaller than the candles before.

Looking forward to your response.

This thread that you are posting on is about using nonlagMA.....at one point people (myself included) started talking about using MTF trix....but that was a bit off topic.

You ask for an indicator that confirms trend on every single time frame.

I am not aware of any that do that.

Since you are posing your question on this thread.....I would suggest you explore the 4 BARS MTF NLMA http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4089990

If you use this indicator on a 5 minute chart you will be able to watch for when 4 time frames confirm 5, 15, 30, and 60

If you use the indicator on a 15 minute chart you can watch for when 15,30,60,240 line up

Although I very much like the 4 BARS MTF NLMA indicator....I am no longer using it.....I am trading without any indicators at all.

It's weird that I still got PM regarding this strategy.

I already give my "gold" for this strategy, but I recall that I still have promise that I havent fulfill for you guys....

So here is how you trade that Coral thing in conjunction with PM forex...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Only buy above coral and sell below it. See and learn the pattern when PA collide with the coral. Put it deep inside your brain memory so well, so you guys will recognize that pattern and its variation instantly whenever you see the chart

I trade this pattern for over years with or without conjunction with other system like The Force 5 Minute, PM Forex, trendlines, Alf,... etc.

I trade EU M5 with only 7-12 pips SL on tokyo, and I rarely lost my money. I ussualy get away with 10-30 pips everyday. That's much money with my account.

That 10.000 hours watching and practicing the chart is worth the effort... Nothing comes easy in this business. You have to master it.

Your welcome... Bobcat!

This FF community already given me so much on the way to become the trader I am now. I guess this is just the time I give back to this community and hopefully this can prevent many newbie to lose money.

I hate losing money. I recall I lost USD 3000 hard earned money in forex when I started this business. I believe many of you suffer more than that. It's hurt. It's not just the money aspects, losing in forex is also hurting somewhere deep...

Losing money has encourage me to train and learn harder and harder. You can earn unlimited money in forex but you can lose just the same. Please becareful and pay your best attention.

Now, the money I lost in forex was nothing compare to what I have earned so far. I consider it as a "Learning fee".

I want this world to be full of happy and rich people who are willing to help others.

Just do me a favor please, if you guys make money from the knowledge I have given in this thread, please dont forget to do some charity to people and community around your neighborhood.

God favors "the Giver".

NiceGuy, thanks for your contributions.  I read the thread, and am starting to understand your strategy.

I downloaded the indicators, as well as the template that you provided earlier on post #663.  Things look a little strange though, like the non lag ma is orange instead of red and green, etc.

Can you please post the indicators and template that you use in a zip file?  That would be very helpful.  Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Some of us has already explain and resolve that problem in earlier post. If you "really" want to success in forex I guess reading this thread all over again is nothing compare to what you will achieve. You got to have a strong will. Do your part. You will learn a lot in the way.

Trust me I did mine and do tons of other thing a lot more than a regular guy who is learning forex......

There's always a link in every broker that leads to a demo account. It's free.... so the best way to answer your question is to try this yourself and learn your part on the way.....

Guys, dont get me wrong. I dont want to be rude. It doesnt mean that I will not help you, but like I said before.... Nothing come easy in this forex business.

There's a part where you have to struggle and learn on the way for yourself. If this forex thing is getting hard on you, you have to be harder and tougher. If it's gets tricky and play you around you have to master those trick and be smarter. If you dont do your part, you will fall hard. Very very hard. I've been there.

There's no person in this world who can make you a good trader. You just have to do your part and overcome those endless obstacle to become one. We have to endure those pain of never ending learning process.  Others may help or share their knowledge to you but none of them can make you a better trader.  It's up to you.

I agree with rolleddice, If you can give us the exact indicators that you have and template at least we know we have the same tools. There is alot of different coral indicators and its kind of hard to keep track through all these posts. I understand the fact that you have to trade and learn your self but as for any on who is trying to learn its important to have the same tools. So i too would appreciate it if you could give us the exact indicators and template in your next post. Nice job on you trading and strategy.

All the indicator and template and even my winning strategy is here in this thread. Just do some click back and forth and do some reading, and if you read carefully you will be surprise with what you will find.... Btw, there's a paperclip icon on top right corner of this thread... I believe there's a reason why that icon is there...

Dont let them play their trick on you...

Nailed 15 pips, with only 7 pips stop Loss...

I just tripple my account for the third time since I playing around with this, time for withdrawal and spend the money. If you guys dont see me for a couple of days it's must be  because I am on vacation somewhere on the mountain with my family or riding my bike accross the country with friends...

When you are getting good at something, you will get bored. The same rules applies to forex and also to any other job . To me, forex is a job, it's supposed to be boring before you can make pips regularly as your salary...

See you guys!

Was this a good entry or a bad entry?  Thanks for the feedback.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Hi Roledice...

If you dont mind, I would like to give my comment on your trade based on my style and perception:

There are few things I would not do:

1. Putting too many stop Loss. Remember to get out fast when you are wrong and stay as long as possible when you were right. Dont let hope and fears play you around in the head especially when you are on the wrong side. In last 2 years I almost always open my trade with the "red" light blinking. (The red light that sign us when the price is already too close to SL).

2. The arrow pointing to a price which is already too far away from coral. Remember the rule on page 1.

3. I would not open a trade that already heading (or too close) to a strong Resistance or support. Especially the R3, R4 or S3, S4 where the price seems already exhausted from climbing and diving. They ussually start the ranging periods at this area before changing direction.

The advantage or should I say the strong point of this PM FX combined with coral is to enable you to buy and sell at the start of the new trend movement. So this strategy will yield more result when it is being used at the end of a trend and start of the new one. In M15, If the trend is already setup and already move about 75-100 pips. Better to stay away and wait for the new trend being formed.

Remember this:

1. Price is the one who move your indicator not the other way around.

2. The chart is controlled by people who put in or pull out their money in or from the market .

3. People can feel fears and hope. They react to news and they need to sleep. They wake up everyday and go to work, open the market and then they put in or pull out their money as a routine job..

4. Now you know when to start your trade...

Btw... I have my losers too... Dont give up.

PS: Watch your chart now, EU m15 is fighting up the coral, wait until the 123 step is being completely drawn to start buy...  but watchout for Frankfurt and London Open....

Hi Koto135 and everybody else...

I am on vacation, but could not help it to see there's still some of you guys in trouble.  I know how it feels when our hope and excitment dissapear once we notes our system or indicators failed and repainted.

Honestly... Guys you dont need that indicator. All you need is to draw some trendlines, use some pivots indi and add a couple MA to trade. All the indi inside the MT4 is already powerful to make money.

The only reason why a newbie (like me when I started out) keep on losing is because we dont pay enough attention to DETAILS . There's is still a wall inside our head that keep pushing us too look for the easier system and easier way to trade and make money. We have to break that wall, and take a jump deep inside to the details.

Learn your Pair.

Dont start out with trading many pairs. Pick one and learn it. Learn how its interaction to Pivots, trendlines and MA.  Passing that 10.000 hours of watching and practicing  the chart  will make a huge difference. It's the difference between professional and a rookie.  When you pass that 10.000 hours, your mind and insting will start to develop a new skills to spot a pattern, opportunity and dangerous trap. That's where you will see everything much more clearly.

It's like hunting a wolf with a rifle. You have to know how to shoot, where the wind blows, hide yourself in the woods, to spot and follow a track, setup a trap, finish your prey, and know your way home. Without those skills, most likely we will be the one who will be hunt by the wolf. Not the other way around. In forex, we hunt for money. It's between your money or theirs.

Forex is a skill. A job. We have to learn hard, train hard and work hard. Like any other job.That's the only way to master our job.

The only thing that would never lie to you or  repaints in Forex is the Price Action itself.

I know it's a bit off topic and I am not trying to show off or being an arrogant here. I post this as a refference for you guys, so you guys who just starting out in forex can realize that there's a guy who is hunting your money on the other side of your screen like this in daily basis. And I am not even close to my mentor. There are probably millions of trader who can do better than me out there. And they are all hunt for our money constantly if you sitting on the wrong side of the trade....

I use only 7 pips stop loss here... See how 7 pips gets you so far. I am doing this in daily basis because it's a job for me. Usually I stop whenever I earn 30 pips a day, but I am just back from a vacation, and I am fresh. I can do this all day long but feeding my greed is never good for me.

Trading is a losing game if you can not control yourself.

- If you afraid to lose, you will lose

- If you afraid to win, you will lose

- if you hope to win, you will lose

-If you lose your hope to win, you will lose

- If you greed you will lose

- If you are not greed, you will lose

- if you get dissapointed and mad when you lose, you will lose even more.

But it's funny how my mentor keep saying : "Forex is like picking money from the floor. It's as easy as that. The problem start only when you start to take more than what you need."

Balance is the key. Learn from the universe around you. How God created the universe and put  everything in a balance to make everything work. That's the rule of this universe. So it means, your trading strategy will only work if you can find a balance inside you. Balance between fear and hope. Balance between starting and stoping the trade. Balance between being smart and be a stupid. Balance between doing the trading and doing everything else you are supposed to do in your life.

There's a limit in everything. The price will not climb or falling forever. At some point it has to rest for turning around or continue further. We should learn from it.

It means, we can not break our limit and expect to become a good trader in a day, a month or even a year. We just have to keep punching and kicking our limit step by step while maintaining a good balance inside ourself. Sometimes we have to stop to get rest before we continue later.

Forex will teach you so much about yourself. Learn from it to recognize and overcome your weaknesses. Keep your balance straight, so you can stand on it. If your balance fall, you will fall.

Remember this, You only lose when you lose your money. Missing an opportunity to make a money is never make you a loser. Dont push your luck by forcing a trade, be patience. There'll be plenty of opportunity in another time.

Got a PM asking me why I use only 7 pips SL?

I decided to answer it here. It's simple. With my style of trading, I never see a reason to use more. Why do we want to lose more?

I am starting out trading regularly with 30 pips SL but it hurts too much for me when it comes to losing. Then I train myself hard how to use less so then I use 15 pips. Then again I learn hard to use only 7 pips for my trade and it's still work just great with my style.

I earn a total 30 pips today without a single loser today, and yesterday I score 100 pips in total of with only 2 losers.

I have a real fantastic money management. I score 5-20 pips max in single trade. I have an average of 2:1 for my RR. If you pay attention to details and know exactly where to put your trades, you will be surprise with how strong 7 pips will hold the trade.

And the best part is ....

....even if  I lose half of my trades, I will still make money.

Of course you can, but only if you really want it to.

Making a light bulb is easy for Edison, paint another Monalisa is easy for Davinci, making another operating system will be easy for Bill gates, or speeding on guitar neck is easy for Yngwie Malmsteen.

Why? This is not only because they are smarter or Genius, but it's simply more because they got used to do the things they do.

Does anyone ever pay attention how many times they failed or how much time they spent to achieve that  result?

Edison said:
" My success is simply because I have already run out a Failure". He failed 9000 times before he finally succeeded.

Yngwie trained himself at least 12 hours a day to master his job as guitar player. Mr Gates spent years to build his first operating system with God knows how many times he failed and fall into frustation. And if you look at davinci design and scribbing, there are still manyo f his plans that never come to life. Why, because he didnt have time for it. He spent his time between trial and error with his earlier invention and paintings.

" Everything would be easy once we master it. But it takes a great will and strong determination to master something"

Now look at us, we always looking for an easy solution, easier way to trade, easier system and easier money. This wont work. Forget that.

If you want to be a successful trader you just have to pay the price with tons of failure, thousand hours of practice, endless reading.

But once we master it, it will stay with us for the rest of your life. It's like riding a bike or swimming. You just have to get used to it and throw away our old habit in trading.

But do you have the required "strong will" and "determination".

Well it's up to you....

I use only 7 pips SL and I dont lose for 2 days... Some of you guys might think it's good job. Ha ha... Wait until you see my mentor. His record was 3 months with no losing... How can I beat that...?

If you dont mind if I am mumbling a little, I wanna tell you guys about my mentor. You might think he is a guy with a tie and suits working in high end office, driving a ferrari or BMW or something.

If you do you are a dead wrong. He is a farmer. He can make unlimited money with trading FX, but this guy is still farming for living. He live up in a mountain village with his family in usual modest home. No one will knows that he is a master trader. He spent his time building and doing  a lot of fantastic thing for people in his village.

I remember when I met him and ask him that I want to learn trading from him. He smiles. Then he took me to his farmland, and teach me how to plant a tree and vegetables....

After a few meetings, then he teach me how to see life, how God keep the balance in universe and how things interact with each other, teach me how to be a useful person for people around me. And finally after a year of knowing him, he teach me to trade with only pencil and paper. Never open MT4 with him that day.

It took me another year for me to finally understand what he meant with his drawing.

Well I know, it sound like a Karate kid story... But that's the way it is. I missed his wisdom in life. He's not only teach me about  trading but he teach me many other things. He teach me about life. He's simply a fantastic person. I missed talking to him.

Oh well... I think I am mumbling too much...

Just close out 30 pips today. How you guys doing?

I will also answer to some PM:

1. No. I can not see the future. Dont be ridiculous. I am sorry if I can not give a signal to anyone to entering the trade. I have my losers too, I can not take the burden of giving a wrong signal that makes someone else losing money.

2. No. Thank you I will not manage any account beside mine.

3. No. I am sorry I am not available for mentoring session. I am happy with my life. I dont need more complication in my life. I write here because I enjoy sharing. My knowledge is free. Just promise yourself that you will do a good things with it.

4. Any guy who said that starting forex will require you to provide a couple of thousand dollar as deposit is a guy who dont know what he is doing. I have a friend that I teach how to trade who grow his USD 10 to USD 300 trading the mini lots. The only reason you are entering forex business is to make money, why provide so much to lose? It does not make any sense.

5. See and learn the candles not the indicator, that way you can trade any system you want and win.

6. The only reason you are entering a trade is to win it, why provide so much to lose? It does not make any sense. If you have problem with small SL that got hit all the time it is because you dont know where to put your trades and keep on revenging the ranging markets as soon as you have losers. See the pattern clearly and train yourself.

Please keep you question here guys, I can not keep up with your PM. I am sorry if some of them remind unanswered.

False breakout is sucks!

I hope you guys can avoid that during tokyo today

EU M15 Todays' Tokyo...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

There are 2 situation I have to deal today on tokyo:

1. Green Circle. I fall to this trap too, (Didn't I tell you that I can not see the future.. ). This is where I am losing my words to describe my action. I opened to day as usual and aim for 15 (Twice my SL). Then when it gets to around 7-8  pips I see a strong rejection to this level. My insting tell me, "Oh no ! this is a false breakout". So I close out as soon when I see my position is still on positive side (+0.50 pips).When I see something is wrong and needs to pull out my trade I always try to close it when it's still in positive side. I dont care if it's 1 or 2 pips.  I am a trader, I dont want to lose money.

I bet there's a question inside some of your head, What if the price return back and heading to the original trade direction. Then It's Okay... It's just not my time to score pips.  I am a trader not a gambler. I just can not gamble my postion with that "what if" sentence. My first interest is to protect my money. After I see my money is in a secured position, then the next is  I will think how to have more money by scoring pips.

I will close out my trade a soon as I detect something is wrong. I have learn to trust my insting and intuition, because I train myself hard to have the correct insting.

2. Yellow Circle. I see the price running fast against the first trade I just close out. I was tempted to enter right away on that small white pinbar. But then again, my head scream... Wait... It's just to soon. Wait until PA break low. Then I opened another trade when PA crossing the low still in rapid movement. I aim for 15 pips and put my SL 7 pips as usual.

Now something funny happened. When the trade goes to my direction about 11 pips and very near to Todays Pivot (FPV), my daughter scream at me to take her to school. I close my trade right away. And take her to school. Trading is important for me but my daughter is one of the reason why I trade the first place. So She's more important for me.

I know there's good chance that I will make the whole 15 pips if I leave it alone. But again, I am a trader not a gambler. 11 pips now is certain for me, but 15 pips is not.  I can not take the risk that the price will move back against me on that PIVOT when I take my daughter to school.  I can not deal with "What if" sentences. Beside I am happy with 11 pips, why should I risk more?

Of course, If I am in front of the screen that time I will wait further because I can see the price is still have potential to move further. And if it turns out to go against me on that Pivot I would secure my postion by closing it around 7-5 pips and looking for re-entry position later. Whatever happened  I will try hard to never let my trade fall into hope and fear situation.

11 pips today, 19 pips to go....

Yes... A friend remided me that I am contradicting myself with what I said in this threa in earlier post somewhere back there...

I recall I said to fire the trades and stay away... But now  what I do is managing my trades while it's running. Do this and that.

It's not a mistake. It's just that I have 2 different situation I have to deal with.

1. Back then I was live testing the strategy with only a tiny account (less than USD 300 account) and 15 pips SL and trading 0.1 lots. It's easy for me to endure the lost because it's relatively small amount of money for me. So There, I keep my trades longer and see what's happened. I was experimenting and trying to adjust this strategy with my style of trading back there.

2. Now, I move back to my original account. (Sorry can not tell you how much in it). I trade a couple of full lots in one trade and using only 7 pips SL. The pressure is hard on me. I have to protect this account from losing while maintain a flow of healthy income everyday.  I guess this is why I tend to keep my trades short with less than 20 pips TP and cut my losers even shorter (7 pips).

Sometimes when I see a situation go against me after the trades goes to my favor like 12 pips, and go back in one rapid movement, I cut my profits somewhere around 5 pips, or sometimes less. And look for re entry later on if it's possible.

Sometimes this is a good decision. Sometimes it's not. But this is what I do to protect my investment. I will nott let myself hoping for price to return back to my favor later and let the trades finally eat all my profits and finally after my SL. Profits is profits. Even it's a small one it's still a profits. Lots better than losing the whole SL while hoping. For me, better to cut it short in profits and fight another trades later.

MAybe I just listen to much to Guy Ritchie last movie..... ( I forget the title). It's Mob / mafia movie.  At some point the movie said..... FIRST RULE OF THE GAME IS TO PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT. Then we think about making profits later... And that's exactly what I do.

Thanks for your contribution here on this thread.

1. Do you use the 1 2 3 set-up still or look for a trade when the NonLagMa changes color (trend direction)?

2. Have u traded this strategy in lower time frames like 1min or 5min.?

Thanks

1. I use both, but I dont follow the Indi blindly since we all know we have a repaints indi here. Look at this way, when 123 step is complete, the indi change color and at the same time price broke out latest High or Low at the same time the arrow showed up... That's where we have a powerful signal.

2. No. But I look on lower TF to find out what's going on. Many times I trigger the trades from M5 and get faster than the arrow because I can  see more clearly there. Sometimes Price already run too far and the arrow is not showing up yet if we wait in m15.

I never trade with m1 chart, too much like a sport there....

NG

PS: EU M15 Now we see the PA fighting the coral to go up, let's see if the PA rejected then pulling back to complete the 123 just before london exactly like yesterday. If Yes... I am expecting a blow there but I might be wrong....  You guys know what to do if that happen. I will start drawing some trendlines now if I were you...Oh no... if coral Failed to hold it... And PA Climb straight in a single run. Expect a Sell position on Open Price Level.

Yes... Coral holds it..... Expect 123 on london... be prepared...

All good info.  I myself just grab 50pip a day at .30  I too would grab only 10-20 if i was trading 1.00 a lot and for sure if I was trading 10.00 a lot.

Hi all,

I'm happy to see that this thread is still alive, so I have a little present for you.

If you don't mind to have the complete history of 4BAR_MTF_NLMA this version of Indicator show only the value of NLMA for current open Candle on Multi Time Frame.

The Time Frame to show are completely user decision, so you can choose the time frame that best adapt to your trading style.

Also you can choose to display Multi Pairs into a single chart, this option maybe it's a bit heavy, in order to have a global view of the market.

Current version doesn't display the arrows that suggest to go long or short, if you like this version of the indicator i can add this feature in future release.

So i hope that you like it and i'm waiting to know what do you think about it

Great indy... & very helpful.... Thanks a lot.

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Yes...Thank  you Gspe...

I will try the indy...

First input... Wish we can setup the color... The NLMA is Green-red, but the indy is Blue-red. To have it in the same color will help our brain tomake the decision... It's Like  all green for "Buy"..... All red for "Sell".

But Thanks a lot.  I really appreciated. I will study the indi.....

Many Thanks

Wow, boy oh boy was I surprised to see this thread is very alive and kicking.  I was "away" due to work, and when I opened my MT4 a few days back, was frustrated that I seem to forget everything.  Guess my old age moments are kicking in ...?

I am very hopeful that given enough time, I am hoping I could become a full time trader one day, using this "simple" technique!

EU M15 and EU H4

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

See how PA is hitting coral and seem always to be rejected on first attempt. Rejection in H4, means 10 - 20 pips in M15.

If you guys realy serious in making money fro forex, you should pay attention to details like this and train your intuition.

Many will try to put a word in your head like this, " TRADE WHAT YOU SEE AND NOT WHAT YOU THINK!". Is this true? For me, This sentence is not alway correct. But it really depends on you.

If you want to trade what you see, then ask yourself ; "Am I seeing the chart corectly? Do I have the skills to see and describe the chart movement corectly? How do I trade what I see if my brain is already thinking at the exact moment my eyes see? Will I put my money on that trades?

See... For me this Trade what you see is another confusing propaganda in forex business. People thinks as a respond to what they see, hear, feel and touch. It's happen instantly in a blink of the eye. No one can stop your brain from thinking at the moment you see. Actually, It takes a brain function to see.

As I said many times before. Nothing comes easy in this job. In order to trade it the right way, you just have to train yourself to see correctly and  to think correctly at the same time. If you pass these too much "SEE and THINK"  your brain will record that in some sort of statistical result in our head, that's what I call Insting and skills. At that moment your brain will develop and an ability to guess correctly and make a right decision instantly. That's what we suppose to do.

It's like Van Gogh who can make a random brush play on a blank canvas instantly but still it looks beautiful. Or Madonna and Jacko who dance randomly but still looks sexy and fantastic, Or Gary Moore who can play random blues notes but still it sound amazing. That's is a skill.

So for me, Do not trade what you see or think, but train the way you see and think first then trade with the skill you earn from that training.

EU M15 After tokyo and Londong Today.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I dont know about you guys but I keep scoring pips with only 7 pips SL here. And I did not lose since the last time I said "I don't lose" in this thread.

If you keep firing on that Arrow I believe you  guys also make some pips today. Well, firing a trade is easy. Finding the best exit, satisfy with your profits or taking loser is different story.

Many people ask me, what is the best exit strategy? I will say "at the exact moment you start to see something is wrong but you get greed!"

As you can see in my chart, I can easily continue my trades and earn more. And at the other hand when I see something is wrong, I also close my trades with 5 pips or even 2 pips profits. I get in fast, get out fast. I dont care about the rest. All I care the most in trading is... Protecting my Investment.

I will not gambling my small profit I can earn now with the chance to earn more in the future, especially when I see something is going wrong with my trades. The chart will continue to go up and down later and tomorrow. So the opportunity to score pips later is always wide open. Why bother taking chances?

Losing an opportunity to make money is never make you a loser.

Hi...Thanks... Will do that. I love to share. Knowledge is for share.....

Here's for today...

Hi guys! Have you seen these movie;  "Enemy at The gates (Jude Law), "Saving Private Ryan" (Tom Hanks)  or "Sniper" (Tom Berrenger).  Yes, not all of them is a good movie, but still I learn a lot from that movie.

(Here it comes my rambling....)

As a trader I always think of myself as an Sniper in a battlefield. Your chart is your battlefield.

What would a sniper do in battlefield inspire me so much in doing my job as a trader.

1. What would a sniper do when he first come to battelfield. He would Examine his battlefield carefully, marking enemy position and movement while not forget learning the intel from his commander

As a trader, We should examine the chart first from higher TF like Daily and down to the TF we will do our trade. We should examine our battlefield carefully .Where is the Open Price, Where's the Nearest and furthest S/R Lines, Where is the pivots. Draw some lines to mark a barrier and chart movement and not to forget to seek "the intel" data from the latest news related to finance world and Forex Business.

2. A sniper would find the best possible place to fire his shots without exposing himself too much to the battlefield. He would worry about where he would hide and where he would escape first before even thinking to fire his shots. He plan the safety of his position first before he plan his shots.

As a trader, we should plan our move. From where we should (not want) fire the trade without exposing our account too much to the market. Draw trendlines, Draf Fibs, read news, do whatever it takes. Then we make some parameter and an action related to it. It's like if the PA bounce to this, and flow this line I would nail the price here, or if the PA decide to pass that S/R I will hit them hard here because here I can use smaller SL. Something like that.

3. When a sniper plan his shot, he would look for the highest impact to the weakest part of the enemys body. He also aimed for the high rank officer not just a regular foot soldier. Because he know exactly that whenever he fire, he expose himself to the enemy. No matter what he is firing at he just have to take that risk. So he only risk himself for higher gain, higher impact and higher damage to the enemy.

He is not a machine gunner who have a box full of ammo. He only take few rounds of ammo in order to move easily and swiftly. Like a ghost. One shot one kill. High impact and very destructive to its target. Timing is everything. He waited long for his perfect shots.

As a trader, we should learn to hit the market only at the right timing. Only hit the highest probablity trade to earn money with lesser risk. Get in at the right timing and get out at the right timing. If we have to risk our money we should only take that risk  for higher gain. The easiest way to describe this is to use higher TP than SL.

3. A sniper is not a death angel who never miss. Sometimes he missed his target and his position is exposed. Sometimes his position being blown out before he take the shots by undetected enemy patrol. At this moment a sniper will never risk his position longer by taking the second shot or do the panic shots. That way he put his own life in danger. He just have to relocate his posittion afeter every shot no matter he succeded or missed.

When everything is going wrong, a veteran sniper can detect that danger early. He develop a special insting to sense that something is went wrong.  He is not panic because he already plan his escape route to his next firing position or a simply safe place to protect his life from the enemy.

As A trader, when market go against us,  we should never be panic. That's why we should plan the risk before firing our trade. If the trades already go to our favor then go back. Get out fast from the market and protect your profits and accounts. Relocate your trades.

As a trader, we should also to plan our every trade carefully and never exposing our account to unnecessery risk by revenging the market with the second trade or a panic "click" trades as soon as our SL got hit. When the trades goes bad. Take that as a gentlemen. Be calm, be patient. Plan your next move carefully before re-entry. Take only postion where our MM can afford the required SL.

4. Sometimes sniper has to take a bullet. But if he is good in covering himself, he will never got a fatal hit i his body.

As a trader, you just have to take that losers. If you are a good trader, you know that losing is just part of the game. A good trader can cover his losers easily with a good MM and know how to recover that loser and still  come up as a profitable trader by the end of the month.

5. Sniper would spend his off duty times with repairing his rifle, do target shooting to train his marksmanship and keep him sharp everytime everyhere. But a sniper also need to sleep, eat, take bath, praying to God asking mercy for his killings, make love to his wife or girlfriend, play with his kids and friends. Have some fun and enjoying life as a regular person.

As a trader we should  always practicing, learning, reading to keep our skills sharp but at the same time we should also give what our body and soul needs,  do the regular activity as a person who live among other people. This is good to keep the balance inside us.

You only need to trade when you need to trade, not when you want to trade. Like a sniper who kill enemy only when his job is requring him to do so. He is not just go out there killing people just because he wanted to seek entertainment..

That's what I do everyday to earn my living from trading.

So much for trading...huh...?...

Well It gets easier when you get used to do it everyday...

Trust me on this.

NG

PS: My friend came to my home today and want me join him to go out to the woods for small game Hunting. I go hunt for the rest of the morning, that's why there's a huge gap from my first and second trade.

Here it comes the Loser...

EU M15 Tkyo to London today
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I sell on that first trade with 7 pips SL, bad timing I know...Then I saw something is wrong happening. Those legs still forming a buy postioin. So I close out early when the position against me for -3 pips. Cut my losers short.

But, as you can see that I was not making the right decision. The Trades move back to my favour and would've hit the TP if I am not Close it early.

Later on, I fired up another 7 SL with buy and hit 15 pips. I cut it there because it's hitting the open price level and my prediction was it will fall rapidly. London Boys is coming. I was not exactly making the right decision here. PA still move about 10 pips up, and fall rapidly right on London Open as I predicted.

We are a trader. We dont deal with what if situation.  Dont let that I should've (not) done this or that sentence ruined your head. You need to see clearly.

1.  Make a BUY/SELL trade with the direction of the arrow (as provided  for by the MTF-NLMA indicator), on the NEXT CANDLE, after the arrow have  shown up.

2.  Filters:

-  PA candle must be small

-  PA must be near the TH4 Coral

I have the said indicator in my experts/ indicators folder but I am not able to see any arrow in the chart window nor the boxes in the indicator window. You may please help me with the link to the last final version of this MTF-NLMA so that I can retry the same and then approach you if I have any problems later.

Thanks in advance.

I need help with this indicator. I have downloaded the indicator and I have it compiled. But then, I do not see any arrows in the chart window nor do I see any bars in the indicator window.

Any experts help is welcome.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Are the arrows in the chart from MTF NLMA indicator. Though  I have the indicator in the experts/indicators folder, I am unable to view any arrows in chart window nor any bars in the indicator window. Infact I tried the template also that you have posted, but that also didnt help me as the arrows and the bars are not visible. The indicator window is completely blank. I have now reinstalled the MT4 platform, but now when I try to add this indicator to any chart, my MT4 platform just freezes and crashes and I have no alternative but to close the MT4 platform and then login again. Your help would be most appreciated.

Thanks.

Why you don't read the instruction, you need to put NonLagMA_v7.1 i indicators folder in order to make MTF NLMA indicator works

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Thanks. Sorry if I have been a bother,but being a complete newbie to forex, I think I did not read the instructions correctly and also made some mistakes with installing the indicators.

From what you have mentioned, is it correct that I should have the 4Bars-MTF-NLMA and the NonLagMA-v7.1 in the experts/indicators folder and that the NonLagMA-v7.1 should be attached to the charts for the correct working of the indicators. If this is done, the arrows (and the bars in the indicator window) would be visible.

Sorry to bother you, but your help is needed for me to have this done correctly.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Hi,

Almost correct, you need to have  the 4Bars-MTF-NLMA and the NonLagMA-v7.1 in the experts/indicators folder, you don't need to have NonLagMA-v7.1 attached to the charts, but if you do so it helps you to see what's going on.

Hope that everything works for you

Hello Guys

I stated using 4BarsMTF NLMA 1.3. I tested this indicator on the strategy tester. What I realized is that the bars of the higher time frames don’t repaint on the strategy tester but they do repaint on the live charts. Could anyone tell me the reason for that?

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
They don't "repaint" after the bar has closed and final colour cannot be known until bar is closed.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Yes in that manner you are right. I’ve noticed that some signals especially the first reversal signal often comes 3-4 candles later because the bars of the higher time frame often move in blocks of 5- 10 bars at the time but on the strategy tester that does not happen. Why?
