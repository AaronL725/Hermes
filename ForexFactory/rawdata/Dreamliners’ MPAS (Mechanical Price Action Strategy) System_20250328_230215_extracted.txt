Greetings fellow traders, I’ve been Forex trading for just over 4 years now, and would like to present a system of trading that I’ve just developed. Please don’t ask for live trading results as I have none so far, only lots of back-testing which shows a successful method. Here are the benefits of this system: One hundred percent mechanical, no discretion needed. All traders should get the same results (except with regard to differing brokers’ quotes, timeframes, etc.) Price Action only (naked trading)—only range bars. No lagging indicators used. Range bars used (time-element removed, only price is shown). Successful in both trending and ranging markets. Reward to Risk is 2-1 (minus spread) on trending aspect, ranging is even better. Tested on GBP/USD only but because it is Price-Action based, will work on any pair. Alert system used to notify when to place trades. Set and Forget once trades are placed. Alert system used to notify outcome of trades. Can be traded at any time, any session. See next posts for rules of this thread and the posting of the actual trading system.

Before I give the system, here are the rules for this thread, if you wish to participate: No questions about how to set up the offline range bar. Please do a “search” on Forex Factory for Range Bars, Offline Charts, or even Google “Range Bar Forex Trading” and “Offline Charts” if you need assistance in setting up this indicator, or if it does not work right for you. I do not wish this thread to get bogged down with people asking questions about MT4, Range Bars, Offline Charts, etc. when all this information is readily available by a simple search on Forex Factory or Google. Please help to keep the discussion simply about the method itself. NO QUESTIONS ABOUT OFF-LINE CHARTS, RANGE BARS, etc. No discussion of adding indicators allowed. If you wish to try different indicators then you are making a new system and should start a new thread. So many systems start off well and then get bogged down by numerous people adding numerous indicators. I do not wish for that to happen here. You may have your favorite indicator that you know would go great with this system; no problem, just start your own thread and invite us all to view it. This system could no doubt use an EA just fine. However, I want to avoid all discussions about EAs on this thread, because, once again, threads get bogged down with “the latest EA, version 4.0.884.331” and so on. If you develop an EA for this system, please start a new thread and let us know that you’ve started a new thread for the EA version of this method. I personally have never found even one EA that is profitable, and I’ve tried many. No negative posting allowed, no name calling allowed, no swearing/cussing, no “ad hominem” attacks. We are all adults here, let’s be civil and kind and courteous to each other.

Also, before showing this system, I want to give credit to Zamanib. His thread is located here . He also provides the range bar indicator on that thread as well as a few other indicators for his method. He is an excellent trader and I encourage you to visit his thread when you can. Now, here is the system on the next post:

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Set up your off-line charts with GBP/USD 30 pip range bars. Again, this thread is not for technical support on how to set up off-line charts or range bars. Please search Forex Factory or even Google for that. Let’s keep this thread free from questions about how to set up off-line charts and range bars. At the open of a new bar, set an alert notification (see next post for the alert system I am using) for 10 pips lower than the open price and another alert for 10 pips higher than the open price. If your low alert is triggered (see next post for the alert system I am using) set a limit buy (or Buy Stop, whichever you prefer to call it) at the open price of the current candle—the candle that triggered the alert. If your high alert is triggered set a limit sell (or Sell Stop, whichever you prefer to call it) at the open price o the current candle--the candle that triggered the alert. Set your target at 20 pips and your stop loss at 10 pips (or both at end of bar price). You will be exiting either at the end of the current range bar or at your stop loss. The exact opposite is done for longs. I treat each bar individually, doing the above steps for each bar, and let the market tell us if we are ranging or trending. Please do a back-test of this method and you will see profitable trades on nearly every bar. Also examine the attached screenshot and look at just a sampling of the pips that can be made. The highlighted bars are not the only profitable trades, they are just a few examples. Please don't ask for examples of trades that would have lost, there is really no way to tell in back-testing. This will no doubt come out when we begin to trade live. Now here are some questions/problems/unknowns/issues: Spread: Do we actually change our limit orders to account for spread? Such as setting our buy stops a few pips (the amount of the spread) higher? Or do we just leave it alone and let the market enter us a few pips lower than the opening price? Back-testing Inter-Bar Activity: This is an unknown because it is very difficult to back-test using actual time. You must match up the range bars’ time with an online chart and it gets to be difficult and confusing, at least for me. Losses might be had when a bar reaches 10 pips lower than the previous bar’s close, then ascends back up to the open so as to fill your limit long, then descends and closes down. During backtest we would not notice this. News-Trading. So far all back-testing I’ve done disregards news events. And yet we know that many brokers increase their spreads significantly during news events, and this could take out our stop loss. Do we then not trade around news time? I’m sure there are other questions/problems/unknowns/issues. That is why I started this thread. This system has enough merit to at least post, and then others will no doubt have questions or thoughts that we can discuss together so as to continue the thread, and hopefully have a profitable system for all on this forum.

I know Metatrader has a built in notification for certain price levels, however I have never been able to make it go to my cell-phone, not even on an email address I have set up on my cell phone (not to mention SMS which Metatrader does not seem to do). So I have looked all over the Internet for a price-level alerting system. For awhile I was using Alert FX but they are now out of business (though they have told me that they are going to be starting a subscription based service soon). I have found a service that works very well; it connects directly to Metatrader for the alerts. It gives alerts (both sound and voice) on the computer, and can easily send SMS or email alerts to a cell phone. I set it to alert me of the price levels I wish, it uses Metatrader quotes, and gives me a sound or voice notification on the computer as well as a notification on my cell phone. I can then enter my trades appropriately. I do not wish to post the URL of this service as I do not know if Forex Factory allows the posting of URLs that recommend a product, so instead I will tell you to simply search for “Easewe Forex Alerter”. The service is free for 20 days and then there is a cost of $29.00 if you wish to purchase. I want it to be known that I am in no way associated with this alert service, nor is any of my family, nor are any of my friends, nor do I receive any compensation whatsoever for anyone who uses/purchases this service. I am merely a trader who has needed an alert service so that I do not have to watch the markets all day and all night, so I went searching for something and found it. Again, I know nothing about this company and am not associated with it in any way, and I receive no “referral fee” nor “affiliate fee” nor any other compensation. I merely use it myself.

[quote=Dreamliner;4263065] Beautiful trade system this seems to be. I will try it on EURUSD &amp; GBPUSD next week using my live trading account. At the end of that week I will report some of the results. Merry Christmas everybody.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Dreamliner, Thanks for sharing... So you basically wait for price to clear 1/3 of the bar size (10 pips) before either entering long or short (depending on trend or range environment)? I'm wondering about entering both since you have a 2:1 RR the idea is that one side will win and net you 10. This is assuming that there will be reaction to push in one direction at the open of each bar after the 1/3 alert occurs. I think this goes back to choosing the right bar size and if your bar size is correct(optimal)... the pair will react better to reaching this bar opening/closing prices... which would lead to more TP's. You're hoping volume will kick in and send it to the direction you desire (opposite for ranging and in direction for trending). In trading both at once all you care about is volume pushes it in any direction straight without a decent retrace. Mathematically in the single strategy you have 1 chance and hope it will continue in the path of the background without a 10 pip retrace and in the dual strategy you have 2 chances and hope it will continue in a path without a 10 pip retrace but you pay for the extra chance with half profit... hmm not sure which is better would need to test this . If the bar size is set up wrong to something that the pair does not respect I suspect you would get alot of whipsaw that would lead to both buys and sells to lose in either direction. Example... people believe EU runs in 30 pip increments right now. That's just thinking outloud... might be better to stick to manual discretion to detect trend/range and choose a strategy accordingly. Thanks, Jag

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thank you Istvan, we will be looking forward to your results. Thanks for letting us know. Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. [quote=istvan;4263103]

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks Jag, good stuff, thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
haha I updated my post a few times.. I have a tendancy to do that maybe its the perfectionist in me I really should stop it... I wonder how hard it would be to do range bars in JForex so we can backtest it with proper historical data.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Interesting system thanx for sharing.. i heard about similar system for commodity market but I didnt know it is possible to setup MT4 with Range bars. Could you please post a setup for offline chart and range bars? :-))) im kidding I wil do my homework and google it:-) Thanx again and Merry Christmas

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks Carolco, for your thoughts. That's funny! I really didn't mean to be a hard-nosed person about the offline charts and range bars, it is just that I have seen threads entirely hijacked by "technical support" issues regarding range bars and offline charts; just didn't want that to happen here. Thanks again for your humor! Merry Christmas!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I absolutely understand your efforts to have you thread clean. I would do the same.. And I cross fingers to let it be so.. have a plenty Christmas presents!! :-)

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I would like to ask You did you backtested another ranges? (f.e. 15, 50 or 100 range)? Knowing nothing about this system Still I feel 30 range bars for GU would be the best option and for EU I would choose 25 Range bars..

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I did no backtesting with other size bars, though because this is price-action triggered I would think it would work just the same. I only chose 30 because just 10 pips a day doubles the account in 2 months and I'm only interested in short term. Also, I think there is less chance of there being "back-tested curve fitting" with smaller ranges. If you'd like to go to 50 or 100 or even 20 or 25 you would just adjust the numbers slightly. It's easy to do on the range bar, just change the setting to whatever figure you would like to see.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Dreamliner, I am sure that I speak for many who applaud your stand on keeping the thread clean. Since we have just started I will just post this one piece of 'thread litter'. Please feel free to delete it after reading. Looking forward to a good thread/system

loss- today on this system

--- 帖子 #18 ---
How many bars have you traded so far? I never trade holiday season.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Well I decided to go against my trading plan and trade on a market holiday. I just really wanted to get a feel for the live mechanics of this system. I determined in advance to only trade 1 bar since it is a holiday. The bar opened at 1.5425, then went to a low of 1.5416 (only 9 pips instead of the desired 10). So I entered a limit order to buy at the open and the market came up and triggered the buy order. From there it took several hours (this is a market holiday all over the world) and my target was hit at the close of the bar. The target was 1.5446. So here are the trade results: Entered at 1.5425 Stop loss at low of bar 1.5416 (9 pips plus spread) Target at 1.5446 (21 pips minus spread) Total so far in live trading: 18 pips (21 minus spread of 3).

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Your screenshot does not explain why you entered on a specific bar, and not those that you would have gain loss.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
The screenshot does not, but the trading plan does. Did you read the trading system? I don't know where I would have lost, as those trades were done through backtesting, not live trading, as mentioned in my explanation posts. This is why I have posted this system on here, to take a trading method that seems profitable through backtesting, trade it live, and see what results we get. I also wanted comments from other traders. P.S. No need to post twice.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Dreamliner, I saw on the doc you posted a screenshot with alerts editor. Is this a alert editor when price comes to a certain price you put in if so it would be nice if you can share it it would help me in my trading. Thanks Ingmar..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes, the alert will happen, either through email or SMS (or both) when price reaches a certain point. I DID share it, read the post about the alerter again and you will see that I gave you the name of the alerter so you could search for it on Google and find it.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Let's say current bar reached lower than previous bar. As long as you don't know whether the next bar is going up or down, how do you know to go Long or Short when the current bar is closed?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
If the current bar reached 10 pips lower than the open, I place a pending Buy order at the open. If the market climbs up to take the pending order, backtesting shows that the majority of the time it will continue the trend and close up. Again I say "backtesting shows" because I have not traded this live, except for one profitable trade this morning.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
hi i think at the close of the bar you would be out with tp if it didnt hit sl in a trend you would go in direction and in a range you go opposite of last bar direction

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Yes. At the end of any bar set your alerts. Set one alert for 10 pips above the open of the current bar, and one alert for 10 pips below the open of the current bar. Let's say the alert triggers at 10 pips above the open. That tells you to set a Sell Stop order at the open. Let's say the alert triggers at 10 pips below the open. That tells you to set a Buy Stop order at the open.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I am confused, though I read your rules more than twice. Please upload a chart picture showing the "current bar", "Open" (of which bar?), how should look the "previous bar" regarding the current bar.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
My friend, you are really confused, and need a picture, showing the "Current Bar Open?" OK, attached is a picture of the current bar open. All you are concerned with is the current bar. After it opens, set your alert for 10 pips above the open and 10 pips below the open. If it reaches 10 pips above the open, set a pending sell order at the open. If it reaches 10 pips below the open, set a pending buy order at the open.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
To make it clear: When bar is opened, you wait to see if it goes 10 pips above its Open price or below it. If it goes 10 pips up, you place a sell stop order at the Open price for 20 pips Take Profit. If it goes 10 pips down, you place a buy stop order at the Open price for 20 pips Take Profit. Stop Loss = 10 pips. Right?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Now, what about the previous bar(s)? I see in the system rules some references about it.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Yes, that is exactly right.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I use "previous bar's close" and "current bar open" interchangeably.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Gotcha!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Dreamliner....how you doing with those binarys? Hope you are well...let me take a look at your system...hope it's a good one.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Ferndog, good to hear from you. I do not trade binaries any longer because I had no positive expectancy in the "system". The reward to risk was nowhere near what it should have been. I have learned that R:R is extremely important in trading and will most likely never trade another system without a good R:R in place. One of the greatest things for me has been getting "Trading Journal Spreadsheets" which shows me in a second what my R:R is, what my expectancy is (either positive or negative) what my return is, etc. etc. In fact it was this very tool that convinced me to stop trading binaries, at least in the particular method I was using. This system here has an "edge" in the R:R and I believe, though have not proven it to be true yet, in positive expectancy.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I wanted to take a brief second and explain my reasoning for this strategy: Most people will tell you to place a sell limit order a pip or two below the low of the last bar, assuming if price drops below the low that a breakout will occur and we can ride the price down. This can certainly be true, which is why this recommendation is part of the "conventional wisdom" of trading. However, consider where this "conventional wisdom" has you place your stop loss (your BUY order): usually a few pips above the low just in case the breakout was false and the price returned and went higher. So.....for any price bar, there are a number of buy orders sitting just above the low of the bar. This system attempts to ride the market up (or in case of a false break to the high, ride the market down) on these orders. I hope this explains what I have perceived to be an "edge" in trading, and is the foundation of this method.

You need to clarify exactly who is a scammer on the thread you posted on your website. You mention the 3MW thread, but do not say who is the scammer on that thread. Is it the author/originator of the thread, or one of the posters? Please, be more specific, rather than merely giving out the URL to a thread.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
As of today's date, December 24, 2010, I have clarified the wording on the initial rules to the system. If you read the initial rules before this date, please re-read if you would like to. If you read the rules on or after this date you have the updated rules. I only changed the wording for clarification; the system remains the same.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Some of this information is not directly related to this method, but hopefully will help us to trade it successfully. I use Oanda for my broker, mainly due to the fact that I can compound automatically. I simply set the "default order size" to "80%" and that gives me a 1% risk for each trade (assuming a stop loss of 10 pips). Then after each win, the lot sizes (units) will increase, and after each loss, they will decrease, to always maintain the same amount of risk. So, we are only risking 1% on each trade, and we are compounding automatically. All is well.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hey Dreamliner... So you don't recommend the trend version of the system? You are always trading ranging? For MM I'm looking at researching Pascal's triangle... there's a thread on here somewhere about it. Jag

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Jag, If we use the rules as now stated they will take into account both trending and ranging conditions. It is just that in a strong trend the market does not often retrace a full 10 pips from the open to give us an entry. But when it does it works perfectly, as we are "buying dips in a rally" and "selling highs in a sell-off" which is the perfect way to trade trends. Because I use "Trading Journal Spreadsheets" I am able to track the success/failure of entering with a 5-7 pip pull-back, an 8-10, a 11-13, etc. In a strong trend we may have to settle for only a 7-pip pullback, which of course will give us much better reward/risk. Pascal's Triangle for Dynamic Stop/Target is much smarter than I am. I don't understand it at all, and for the moment and simply sticking with the current exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Dreamliner, At the open of a new bar, set an alert notification (see next post for the alert system I am using) for 10 pips lower than the open price and another alert for 10 pips higher than the open price. If your low alert is triggered (see next post for the alert system I am using) set a limit buy (or Buy Stop, whichever you prefer to call it) at the open price of the current candle—the candle that triggered the alert. If your high alert is triggered set a limit sell (or Sell Stop, whichever you prefer to call it) at the open price o the current candle--the candle that triggered the alert. If I think this is the post your eluding to for instructions on how to use this system then I am thoroughly confused with how you can trade both trending and ranging markets. This to me means that you are buying on a low alert and selling on a high alert.. thus trading against the trend. To me then it is saying its trading a ranging market. During a rally for example you may hit your high alert... you take a sell at open per the rules and then it finishes up... how are you buying the dips? Jag

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Take a good look at the downtrend on December 17. This is a serious downtrend. With the open of each new bar there are a few pips of upward retrace, sometimes as much as 10 pips. It is on those retraces that we enter our sell orders at the open, and jump on the bus going downhill. As they say, may your longs go higher, and your shorts go lower .

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Ahh I see however wouldn't you have bought at bottom of some those bars that retraced to the open after a low alert.. when you know there is a good chance it will probably reverse and continue the selloff? I guess that's where having the good R:R would help.. Jag

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes, I'm sure we would have. This is what cannot be shown in backtesting but will no doubt be discovered live. As you said, the good R:R will help.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yup you're right... KISS until proven otherwise.. don't add complexity until over x number of trades the win/loss ratio doesn't allow your MM to increase equity on a stable basis. (creates a negative equity channel) If you can improve win/loss (longer time before trades) then it will take longer to validate because more time to get to x number of trades.. but I think that's where backtesting will come into play. All you really need is 50/50 which is asking for alot taking spread into account. After that its all MM. BTW Dreamliner... I'm going to call you DL from now too long to type your name (programmers are lazy)... Dukascopy seems to allow you to use range bars (up to 10 for some dumb reason)... but you can simulate 30 easily by only looking at every bar x 3... this would mean stability of the range bars "should" be pretty good because the platform is doing it for you... strategy testing on JForex is alot better because of bid/spread built in historical data. Tick quality is always 100% so you can get a realistic idea of how your system performs over time. Let's see how it goes.. merry xmas and happy new year.. Jag

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks for your words of wisdom here, Jag, very nicely said! Merry Christmas to you too, and have a wonderful new year!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Sorry Brian, I really didn't understand your post here. Why are you talking about "4 hours" and "daily" timeframes? We use range bars here. Can you please explain exactly what you are saying here? I don't usually click on .zip files unless I trust the source, and I don't know you.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
sorry i didnt clarify this eg 15 minute charts 30 minute charts live and offline dont click on the aattachment its not dangerous but i understand your reason these are only great files on currencys percentage pips at certain times of the day excellent articles sp to clarify my question in mt4 which chart do you use 15 min 1 hour 1 day ect for your range bars from BRIAN

--- 帖子 #52 ---
As mentioned in the first several posts, I'm not answering support questions on range bars. Please search Forex factory and you'll find out how to set them up. I'm not at all trying to be rude, it is just that if we start talking about how to set up range bars we will be flooded with technical support questions on offline charts, range bars, etc. and I don't want that to happen in this thread. Thank you for understanding.

im a slow learner 35 years trading but mt4 , i learn something new every day thank you from brian

--- 帖子 #57 ---
It looks like you got it!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I'm sure I could learn a lot from you, Brian!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
realy great stuff mate it so happens it fits in perfect with my thread great work a dream i understand why my question was so stupid but once isaw the video i understood looks a superb tool your idea is super cool what you have descibed is a perfect fractal use using 10 pips understanding best entry time of day will help i think but great work with those negative idiots block them out a very very merry xmas thank you once again from Brian

--- 帖子 #60 ---
next i must learn to ajust the true range indicater to the actual as per the square indicater ( the 2 yellow lines) in this case to maximize your great system still need to ajust the settings but looks great beginning

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Glad you see the benefit of it, thanks for the encouraging words. Have a very merry Christmas!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thanks dreamliner succes with the thread

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I have been thinking about going to a 50 pip range bar and at the open of the new bar setting my alerts at 20 pips above and below the open. If triggered we would have a 20 pip stop and a 30 pip target. The reason I am considering this is because it does not take much for GBP/USD to move 10 pips either way in a 30 pip range bar. But it takes quite a bit for it to move double that, and then back to the open, then another 30 pips the other way in a 50 pip range bar. My plan is to do 20 live trades with the original method of 30 pip range bars (with 10 pip stop and 20 pip target), and then 20 live trades with 50 pip range bars (with 20 pip stop and 30 pip target) and compare the difference. I'm sure there will be some tweaking that needs to happen beyond this even.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I think its a good investigation to try to find a suitable pip interval that each pair reacts.. like EU does to ~30 right now... I found using ATR H1 500 mimicks this with EU (gives you 29)... and gives about 27 for GU... you can double it to get 54 and would have a better reactive bar I think.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
When you say "double it and still have the same effect" do you mean we could double from 34 to 68 and still have the same effect? If so that would make 50 pip range bars perfect. Though 50 pip range bars (with 30 target and 20 stop) does not have quite as good of R:R as the 30 range bars do (with 20 target and 10 stop) I do believe the hit rate would be better. Would you agree?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Haha I edited my post... I was adding in spreadx2 to it but you probably shouldn't since price wouldn't react the same... Well I thought the idea was to trade with 1/3 bar SL and 2/3 TP... thats 2:1 but just needs to move more also has more room to move.. we just need to ensure that we find a bar range that "reacts" with the pair and not just random number (to increase expectancy) This number can be always changing and so would SL/TP.. with 30 pip bars your SL was 10 pip (1/3 * 30) and TP was 20 (2/3 * 30).. you get out at the end of each bar. Which makes sense because it matches the profitable trades that you saw when you visually back-tested the range bar indi. Maybe 30 is the magic number... but I hate magic number I always want to find reason which is why I curve fitted the ATR to get 30 pips on EU (this is what Malcolm told me... 30 pips movement at a time on EU) Jag

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Jag, Thanks for your helpful comments. My only concern about the 30 pip range bar as opposed to the 50 pip range bar is the hit rate. Granted 30 range bar has a better R:R but the 50 would most assuredly have a better hit rate. I suppose it is a trade off both ways.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yup you know what would be cool is if we can optimize this with range bars and SL/TP as inputs.. and whatever equity measuring stick as the output. You said Mt4 backtester wouldn't work right? The R:R is the same with any sized range bars... expectancy might change though depends on how "good" the bar size is for that pair.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Now THAT would really be good! I do not know if MT4 backtester works or not, as I'm no good at using it. If anyone can figure out any way to backtest this it would help.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
It is hard so on a range bar what going -- it hard to tell if price touch the entry and then went down back --- bit if you put up a 5mins regular chart you will see it clearly it did not touch the entry-- ( we see the buy is trigger now - because it reach below 10 pips from open waiting to go long - but price did not touch the open price yet since it went down to the trigger line I hope this make sense and will help you to physically see what price is doing I am speak about the last bar on the rangebar chart

--- 帖子 #71 ---
That's fine, I did not trade the last bar, I only traded one bar today, and that was profitable.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
- I use a custom-built simulator that deals with range bars just fine. I'll run some tests when I get a chance. - If you set the TP to be the close of the current bar, the absolute best you can do is a 2:1 RR ratio (before spread). This would be a perfect trade where the price moved exactly 10 pips in one direction from the bar open, then immediately moved back in the opposite direction to the bar open to trigger your trade, and then continued in the same direction until bar end. That is 20 pips before spread. Your true RR ratio (after spread) in this perfect trade would differ depending on how you set your SL (using bid or ask) - something more like 1.7:1 or 1.8:1 for a pair like EURUSD. Again this is the perfect trade. However, in most situations, the initial move will not go exactly 10 pips in one direction. It will go more than 10 pips. In fact, it could go up to another 19.9 pips and still reverse and trigger your trade at the bar open. In this case, if your TP is set at the close of the bar, your profit would be less than 20 (before spread) and could be as low as 0.1 pips (again, before spread). My point is: to truly get a RR ratio of 2:1 with 30 pip range bars you would certainly need to set your TP past the close of the current bar, sometimes much further past.

Why do you think there should be a trade on that range bar? At this very range bar price opened at 1.5457, went op for 2-3 pips and then dropped down. There isn't any way I can see a price movement to trade the Short or the Long. There is no trade on every new bar. In this bar there is no trade.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Look at the charts i posted -- open pice is 15447 it went below 10 pips (15437) but did not retrace up back to 15447 to open buy

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Right. The same for the other side. Price dropped down and did not retrace back to Open price. As long as you did not enter a loosing trade (not to mention entered wrongly) - it's ok. Not every range bar is a trade bar. This bar is not a trade bar.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I just did a few days in in decemeber 1st--3rd not all bars are tradeable - this is the condition i work with from open price -- price must move above or below minimum 20 pips and not exceed 35 pips the blue arrow with (blue w) met the above conditoin- the blue arrow with (yellow w) fall short a 1 -3 ppips to met the minimum 20 pips below or above open price. If this what i am seeing we have a great thing going here

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Yes this is why I said to take both trades so if it goes in any direction it will get you 10 tips. A zigzag within the bar will cause you to lose 20 pips... so at worsed you are 1:2 and at best you are 1:1.. if you can get 65-75% win rate then it will be ok... but anything less would be a loser. We have to test to see what strategy gives the best win rate first. Jag

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I will continue to back test december-- or if someone can helping out by making a simulator then it will be eaiser to back test- the condition is --easy

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Zamanib, with a 50 pip bar you would set an alert for 16.6 pips since that is 1/3 of the bar. Your SL would be 16.6 pips and TP would be double. Try that. Jag

--- 帖子 #80 ---
i will do 20 for now easy on the eyes and brians to compute (lol) also when we have simulator we can change range size tp size buy sell trigger value ok be we still need to look at 5mins regular chart on the back test then our result will be accurate-- i did one example to show the 1st bar on december 1st look the chart on 5mins regular cahrt -- this confirm the accuracy it will be a pian -- to do this manunally -- even if we have simulator for rangebars we will still need to manually confirm on 5min regular chart just for 100 + trades why -- we need 5min chart to see-- because the the 1st bar in december took 1:15 mins to complete and price could have move up down many times it is hard to tell on a rangebar where it went but it is clear on 5min regular chart

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Yes, not every range bar is a trade bar. Of course the price will not retrace sometimes.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Zamanib, this is exactly what drew me to this method. You're seeing it right, and look at all the profit to be had. But here is the only problem I see: take a look at the last bar you have drawn a W on, the up bar. It is possible that that bar went up 20 pips from the open, triggering us to place a Sell Stop order at the open, then went down 40 pips, then went back up 50 to close. This would have been a loss. That seems very unlikely that a prices will oscillate that much. What seems much more likely is that it dropped down 20 from open, triggering our Buy Stop order, then moved up 50 to give us our profit. But since we've removed the time element we don't know which order that bar moved. Did it move up first, then down, and back up? Or did it move down and then up? This is where some kind of an official back tester would come in handy.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yes, I was thinking of this very thing last night. We will of course set both a minimum and a maximum the bar can drop before we will allow our order to be triggered. Thank you for your comments.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I was actually thinking 20 pips on a 50 range bar with a take profit at 30 or the close of the bar. This would give us a better hit rate.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
This is exactly right, Zamanib, this is why I said that live trading will reveal the weak spots in this system. However, if we stick to 50 pip range bars with a 20 pip trigger and stop loss and a 30 pip target, it will greatly minimize the oscillations which would take our profit.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I will be tracking 15-17, 18-19, 20-22, 23-25, and 26-30 individually. This is easy to do with Trading Journal Spreadsheets. Of course each one of those entries will give us different R:R.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
For back testing -- there is difinetly we need to look at the 5min regular chart-- from my previous chart with blue arrow and w -- for far 2 of them went yoyo -- and take out the sl ( my sl will be the distance from 20 from open-- or we could do the high or low of the bar

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hello, I am a new member to FF but have been reading the threads for a long time. I have been trading forex for a few years now and find this thread very intereting. I use range bars on MT4, therefore may I make a suggestion concerning the back testing. I would suggest using a 5 range bar for your backtest rather than time. The 5 min bar covers too much range where the 5 range bar would give a more accurate read. Just my $.02 worth

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I don't understand why it would have been a loss. Once the bar went up 20 pips from the open, triggering us to place a Sell Stop order at the open, then went down 40 pips - You win the Short trade . Now. There are 2 options: 1. When Sell stop hit - Buy stop order will not be taken. 2. Buy stop order will be taken, so if later-on the price went back up 50 - you win again. This time, the Buy trade .

--- 帖子 #90 ---
you miss the point man--- WE ARE TRYING TO SEE THE PRICE MOVEMENTS-- range bar you can not see price movement for back testing

--- 帖子 #91 ---
It gets a bit confusing because with 30 pip range bars, price can do all sorts of things to go in and out of profit or to stop loss. I don't have a solution, but it would be great if we could have some smart MT4 coder create an indicator that would show the movement within a 30 pip range bar. The attached image shows 5 pip range bars moving within a 60 minute candle If we could have 5 pip range bars moving with 30 pip range bars that might give a better visual.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I don't have a solution, but it would be great if we could have some smart MT4 coder create an indicator that would show the movement within a 30 pip range bar. this is main point --to see price movement with in a 30 pips rangebar or 50 pips rangebar-- this is only for back testing-- do that you need to look at 5min chart-- please dont get carried away my time -- it is not time we are looking at it is price movement--within the rangebars and this is only for backtesting

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Exactly right! This is the only way we will be able to tell if this system has a positive expectancy. Well that, and live trading.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
pgpb, Thank you, my point exactly, if you look at a 5 min chart then compare any given bar to the 5 range bars for the same time you will be able to better determine the movement w/in the time bar! The 5 range bar would be a better method of seeing a more accurate movement w/in the 30, 50 or whatever range you are attempting to do a manual back test.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
although im not experienced yet with mt4 range bars the concept of trading range is well understood by me for example the indicater bsed on the 3bar breakout the hh and ll of the prevoius 3 bars not including the current formed bar is well understood as an accurate tool for defining the current range ( the square) this use of the trading range and trading bars within a sideways market is well understood for swing high swing low by most experienced traders so the fractal breakout of the range ( eg 2 pis either 2 the long or short ) is used as the trigger start of the new range in trading ok nothing new but adding clarity to the use of range bars the trading range and timming entrys and exist so the win loss of trading within a range and breakout of ranges eg range bars the square is based on fractals so dreamliner is using a method as i can see as fractals eg plus 20 or 5 as fractal entry depending on size of the trading range or trading bar excellent method in a side way market or in the time frame large when hugh movements occure causing expansion and contraction of the range bars or in a side ways trending market but one needs in my opinion to define the time you wish to trade and the method of using the RANGE bars to help in the percentage hit rate otherwise one can be like a cat chasings its tail finding the ideal pips above or below the range for finding perfect entrys or the fractals within the range back testing in demo is a waste of time. for demo traders its a nice game only testing under the 4hour range is realy crazy due to market volatility after years of involving myself in back and forwood testing and neutral networks ang generic anologue testing shows one how stupid this back testing is for forwood projections in real time trading but of couse demo traders have a different opinion now it seems to me this range trading using potential percentage win loss ratios as dreamliner is doing is a sound idea much the same as one uses pips to the top of the range the range to pips to the bottom for risk reward calculations for me the introduction of range bars to mt4 has opened my eyes to another great tool so i just added a few additional thoughts of mine to this potential great thread as im sure with positive support to dream liner it will produce great results in the future i hope the above may help in understanding to the new commers some basic principle of using the trading range which the range bars if properly ajusted can be a very valuable tool thank you dream liner for your thread great work from BRIAN

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank you very much for your input here Brian. I agree with you about backtesting; the only value it would provide in this case is to see exactly what happened during any specific 50 pip range bar. It LOOKS like it went up 20 pips and then down 30, but is that REALLY what happened? Or did it go down 20 first, then up 40, then back down 30. I'd just like to be able to examine any 50 pip range bar and see what happened and compare that with how it looks.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Great Thread

--- 帖子 #98 ---
this what we are trying to achive-- I manually look at most of the trades on the rangebar chart -- then look at the 5min to see the price movement-- the success rate is high- but it is time consuming to do -- no one making an effort to do it manually-- I can commit to do 1st 10 days in December anyone else can take the rest of the month and other do November October

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I would be happy to help, I just don't know how to do it. For instance, when the range bar's time says "1224" I believe that is the time when the bar ended, correct? So do you just take the time from one end of bar to the time of the next end bar and see what happened in between?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
take the time current bar (open time) then time of the next bar opening (the bar to the right) time will be off sometime 2 - to 4 mins no problem I did december 22 take a look

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I wish i was a programmer-- it is should be easy to do and indicator -- for the regular chart -- this what it need date -- start --end time start -- end open price -- draw line 20 from open draw line -20 from open draw line some thing like this

--- 帖子 #102 ---
nice job z i will look at automated testing

--- 帖子 #103 ---
The problem is when I place my cursor over a range bar, the time it shows is actually the end time of that bar, I do not know when it opened. I guess it is just logical to assume that it opened when the previous bar ended? So for any bar we wanted to back test we could take the time that the previous bar ended as the start time, and go until the end time of the current bar. You're showing me what I thought would happen, though, and that is encouraging for this system. Thank you for your hard work so far.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Here are my results running through simulator. I need to do some verification of the data when I get the time, but thought I would post now for others to review if desired. Conditions are: - Week of Dec 5, 2010 - EURUSD using Dukascopy tick data (converted to US Eastern Time) - No commissions or swap calculated - 30 pip range bars (based on bid) - Alert 10 pips from bar open - When alert triggered, pending trade set at bar open - When trade triggered, SL set at -10 (not including spread), TP set at close of bar - When bar closes, start all over again

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thank you very much! Could you try this again with just a few changes: GBP/USD 50 Pip Range Bar Alert 20 pips from bar open SL 20 pips TP set at close of bar The rest is the same.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Why TP set to the close of bar and not to fix pips?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Would somebody please answer me what I got wrong? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=91 I think that TP has to be ~20 pips and not the Close of the bar

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I can also see, at just a cursory view of the spreadsheet, that there will need to be both a minimum (which we have now) and a maximum pips from open set. But let's wait until we get the results back from the 50 bar with 20 pips to open and see what those numbers need to be. I get this from the first trade that was made: 1 2010.12.05 19:04:14 Sell 1.34024 2010.12.05 19:05:55 1.33929 9.5 I would not have taken this trade because of the R:R. The market had risen not only 10 pips to trigger the entry, but a little more than 20 pips, making only 9.5 pips available for profit with a 20.5 stop loss. But we're doing good, just need to tweak until we get positive numbers.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
What would be the result if the hard SL was 10, hard TP 20 and we set pending set-and-forget orders at any possible range bar? BTW: I personally find it impossible to trade with 10 pip SL... But maybe I am wrong

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I'm with you, that is why I'm changing to 50 pip range bars with 20 pip triggers and 30 (or end of bar) targets.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes I will run this.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I have not seen a consensus on the where the TP should be. So I picked the close of bar for now.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
No, take profit is end of bar. We are only trading one bar at a time, not swing or position trading.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Why end of bar? It spoils the R:R ratio, I am afraid... If you have a hard SL defined in a number of pips then you should not set a TP at a random place like end of bar.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
We're going to have to find a way to keep R:R positive. So 20 is the trigger (minimum), but we're going to need a maximum, which I would say should be 25 which would give us 1:1 R:R.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
We are only trading one bar at a time. We will not trade if we have less than 1:1 R:R. So when market drops 20 on a 50 Pip range bar, it triggers an alert and we enter a buy stop at the open. However, if it continues to drop past 25 we cancel the buy stop as we will not be trading this bar.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
If the TP is the Close of bar you will never be able to calculate the R:R. TP has to be known in pips or regarding the SL size but not just a "Close of bar". Close of bar may be sometimes near the Open of that bar, while the price before that Close, was already 15-20 pips away in your trade favour.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I do not like the idea... I would prefer to set SL to BE and leave the position open at the end of the current bar if in profit. Otherwise, you cut your profits short.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
That sounds fine, but it is not this system. Why not make your own thread with that method, and let's do some comparing?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Yes, you can calculate the R:R. If price drops 20 pips, and you set your buy stop at the open, you can look at the low of the bar and add 50 for the close of that bar. This is the benefit of range bars. You know exactly how high it will close. Example: market drops 20 from open, you know it will close 50 pips higher if the market goes up. Once your buy stop triggers you set your stop at the low of the bar (20 pips) and your take profit at the high of the bar (30 pips). You will exit the trade with either minus 20 or plus 30.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
basic idea of dreamliner re stop loss profit is corect just needs some future testing and ajusting i think but the basic essence of dreamliners is great great work mate from Brian

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Here are the results for this test. Sorry it took some time. I made a change to the simulator - it can take a while to run through a week's worth of tick data in visual mode - 15 minutes or so. I do that to make sure the simulator handles the strategy correctly. I think it is working as programmed at this point. So, I will run in non-visual mode going forward unless questions about the test authenticity arise. Non-visual mode runs in about 1 second for 1 week of ticks! Let me know what test you would like to run next and we'll see what we can do. Also, please let me know if any of the trades do not look correct. I try to verify the data, but verification of the trades can really take some time.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Sorry, I did not mean to disturb your thread. I just wanted to make a suggestion to not close the positions too early. I will stay silent from now on. Unfortunately, as a professional trader, I cannot afford to test raw systems... Bye.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
you can calculate the R:R only if you limit the maximum that the price can go away from Open, before you place the pending orders, which I am not sure it is good idea.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I am almost sure that it will be easier to test this (great) system, if you determine both SL and TP in fix pips or ratio.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
No problem at all, thank you for this test. However, are you sure this has the right data? This looks like it is still basing off of the 30 pips range bar with the 10 pips trigger rather than the 50 pips range bar with the 20 pips trigger. Am I just seeing the results wrong?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
No disturbing whatsoever, I do understand what you are saying. But for my lifestyle I must limit the time in trade, which is why I developed this method. Not saying your remarks are not valid, they are, just not to this system. If you made another thread we could all follow your testing there. Either way, thank you for your comments.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
GBP/USD 50 Pip Range Bar Alert 20 pips from bar open SL 20 pips TP set at close of bar one could on demo test using a limit order as above with set price from open and take profit and stop loss so infact using limit orders and demo one can test easily the system with an alarm for the opening one can have an auto limit order set up for limit order stop loss and take profit easy to do manualy then emotion is taken out the trade from Brian

--- 帖子 #129 ---
If the market drops 20 and triggers the buy stop, there will indeed be a fixed pips of SL and TP. SL will be 20 and TP will be 30. We could also allow a little leeway. We could use market dropping of 18 which would make the fixed TP of 32 and the fixed SL of 18. We could even go the other way a little and allow the market to drop a max of 25 which would give a SL of 25 and a TP of 25. So to be strictly mechanical we use 30 (Target) and 20 (Stop Loss). But if we wanted to get a few more trades we can fudge a few pips either way, as long as we do not go less than a 1:1 R:R. In real trading what I am going to do is set my trigger at -18 from open, then place my buy stop at the entry, at the same time setting a trigger at -25 from open. If the -25 triggers I'm going to cancel my buy stop order as it would be less than 1:1 if triggered. However, if the buy stop triggers I will then set the target and stop loss to be the exact low and high of the bar. This may result in a 1:1.5 R:R (20 SL, 30 TP) or a little less or a little better.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Yes, exactly right Brian. By the way, I'm interested in your Inside Bar, but not sure how I can use it to help backtest. I'm real slow in learning, thank you for your patience.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
here is the indicater for you to test with your system dreamliner you beat me to the punch re actual eg -18 taking into account the spread also many trades use eg 75% of the range but i think that with the corect ajustment to the range bar it may only mean an ajustment to take profit of the spread of the broker your use of limit and stoploss and take profit will be enhance by fine tunning i think using lsma with a setting of 21 will raise your success rate for trend direction in my opinion but basicaly with good participation by testing demo using limit order will confirm your fine tunning if many are involved ok here is this old indicater brians inside bar as requested

--- 帖子 #132 ---
What if price dropped 22 pips. You won't trade this bar? I would not trade only bars that retrace exact pips. edit: I mean to gain profit in pips even if price reached the TP at the next bar(s) and not only at the same bar.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Looks like I named this GU results file the same as the EU results file. Maybe that is the problem. Try this file with about 4.5 months of results for GU 50/20.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Yes that is much better. Is there a way to add that we are not going to take the trade if it drops below 25 pips from open? So we can take anywhere from 18 to 25. And if it opens an order at 18 the take profit would be 32, if at 19 it would be 31, if at 20 target would be 30, and so on right up to 25. Can this be programmed? The reason I'm asking is because I see numerous trades that lost 39 pips or more, and I will not be taking those trades. 25 should be the max loss.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Did you not see where I said anywhere from 18 to 25? I know the posts have been flying fast and furious today, maybe you didn't read those yet.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well, if you enter a trade in a bar which drops between -18 to -25 pips then your TP is not strict and your R:R is going to be unstable.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
i think this range bar and dreamliners system can be enhanced as you see the inside bar idenifys (the yellow or red opening price on brians inside indicator simple yellow is higher opening price of last bar red lower opening price and where we are currently in respect to the current range bar now to get advanced warning of setting limit orders either short or long whith a high probabilty of success i would use an lsma setting 21 with inbuilt email or sound alert for advanced use of orders using dreamliners stop loss take profit within his range bars as there is already such an indicater with these features available it will be handy for you to look at i think in fact its so good the great trader slats uses in making hugh pips in his trading it seems to fit in so well with dreamliners great idea of maual trades with range bars to me but we all trade different i hope you find brians inside bars helpful in this great potential system thank you dreamliner from Brian

--- 帖子 #138 ---
notice green orange trend line giving ample warning of dreamliners method of range bars this has alreadyan alert system built in with full facilities to turn on eg email sound written so one can utalize easily this as an advanced warning system to improve hit rates on range bars i think if dreamliner thinks he can use it i will post it otherwise in respect to this thread i wont look at the screen snap shot on range bars from BRIAN

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi Brian, Yes please post it. I'm not sure how it would give heads up though, but let's take a look.

Unstable? I don't care about being stable (just ask my wife!) I care about being profitable.

Thans Brian, I'll look at this.

you screw the thread up-- man start your own thread-- so far non has done what I did for back testing--- I will do it all ---

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I am going to manually do the back test -- the way i showed it previously -- 30 pips range will not work -- 50 pips range is the way to go- rules from open -- +20 -20 above/below open price is trigger line if exceed 30 pips above or below open price no trade if goes to 18 0r 19 pips below/above you are on your own risk if goes 31 pips below/above you are on your own risk i will do the back test for 20/20 above/below not exceeding 30pips stop loss will be high (so that mean our sl will be from 20-30 pips) minimum/maximum) target will be end or close of the bar ( our tp will be 20-30 pips) forget about about winloss ratio in that one bar-- they are more winners than loosers-- that what i want to confirm in backtesting-- our over all winloss raito is great (but will confirm after 100 trades) or on a monthly basis net profit in pips or % stay tune i will do all of december 1st

--- 帖子 #145 ---
i hope you know what you are doing and testing-- see my post how to manually back test-- your result wayout

--- 帖子 #146 ---
what are you trying to accomplish in this thread--

--- 帖子 #147 ---
did you ever see an insider bar on a rangebar chart-- does not exsist

--- 帖子 #148 ---
i never see a chart that give the time at the end or close of bar it is always the begining of bar opening (time is given)

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Zamanib, this is exactly what I came up with too. Very good. I just honestly have not figured out the timing issue of how to back test, but I'm sure of what you say here that the hit rate will be very good, assuming the 50 pip range bar, and the exact numbers you came up with below. That's exactly what I'm using too.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
lets focus -- and dont get side track we have a great system on hand but every one want it come to there laps lets keep it simple -- the great think about this system no guessing no laging indicators -- agian focus on the main system

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Right, same with me. But if you watch the range bar when it is live, you see the bar is painting the current time, not the start time of the bar. And when the bar ends the current time shows on the bar, so the time is at bar's end. It is the weirdest thing because I am always use to the time being when the bar started, not when it ended. I guess range bars are different.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
You're right, I like you

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Please enlighten me - which result is "wayout"?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
my friend please follow the rules -- i posted -- and the only way to backtest a rangebar price movement from top to buttom is by looking at 1min or 5 min chart pirce movement -- from the open of the range bar and closing if you have done that then we are in business I DONT WANT TO SEE ONLY EXCEL SHEET SHOW THE CHARTS LIKE WHAT I DID

--- 帖子 #155 ---
This what i will be doing rangebar chart - with the 5min chart(just to show price movements)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
i am sure you have good intentions and systems -- but in the begining dreamliner say to comment and improment on this system you are free to help doing what i am doing -- if you can do november will be great-- also we do trade live -- i am not here to play with anyone i trade live and post live trade win or loss

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I ran this test as you requested - for GBPUSD 2010/09/05 - 2010/12/18. 151 Trades 58 Wins 93 Losses Avg Win 26.8 pips Avg Loss -20.49 pips Net profit of -351.3 pips I noted 3 losses of more than 25 pips. One is a loss of 27 pips - not out of the question when you factor in the spread (25 pip loss + 2 more pips for the spread). I did not research this one as it is a very reasonable result. Another one is a loss of 30 pips. This happened at 11/16 04:30:01. A nice spike during a GBP news release. That is going to happen and the simulator caught this situation nicely. Another one is a loss of 39 pips. This happened at 9/14 04:30:06. Again, a spike during a GBP news release. However, there seems little point in me posting the complete backtest results since Zamanib is here to solve all our backtest problems with his manual method of looking at M5 charts. I wish you luck with your trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thank you for pointing out that manually (visually) backtesting this strategy using M5 charts is more efficient and more accurate than a systematic approach using: - Tick data from a reliable source - Real spread history - Automation - processing 4 months of data in a few seconds I can't believe how stupid I have been to not recognize this sooner. And I'm sorry I ignored your expert advice regarding the only way to backtest rangebar charts using M5 (or M1) data and the acceptable rules of posting backtest results on this thread. I'm going to delete all the tick data I have accumulated. I'm going to delete the simulator I created and the associated libraries of source code. That trading server replicator I created...it is gone. I'm just going to use good-old M5 data to get the most accurate backtesting of rangebars there is. This thread is very lucky to have you and your advanced knowledge of trading and MT4. I wish you much success with your trading.

something is wrong--- do december let compare our result-- thank for your strong words--- we are looking at price movement with in a rangebar -- i still think you are doing it wrong

--- 帖子 #160 ---
m5 m1 are not the same chart as 1min or 5min m1 and m5 or m2 is just a label given to rangebar

My contribution to this thread. On attached xls file, the results of my Manual BackTesting on December 1st-3rd.

I started to work on the back test-- result is amazing 5 for 5 so far

--- 帖子 #163 ---
5/5

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thank you guys for all your hard work in backtesting. So far what it has proven is that the results are quite different. I only trade live, too (with very small unit sizes) and will post my results as well. Thank you all again.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
dont give up on this system-- i know the only way to back test it . It is the way i am doing and the way you are foward testing it i am also doing that-- i see great result-- no one want to do hard work- manually-- i will continue to do back test prove the other result wrong-

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes, I'm not giving up at all; I am vowing to do 20 live trades with this system (that is what I do with all systems). I know that 20 is not a lot, but you can get a good feel for it then. Please let us know the results of your backtesting when you can. I would help you if I could only get the time of the bar figured out.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
6 for 6 -- we need to hook up online -- skpye to yahoo you have my id -- i will be online 3hrs the time is opening and not close -- i check it -- if this it is the end time -- then try and you will see

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I think I have to fly from New York to Dehli today so won't be able to hook up online. But I will backtest assuming the time listed on the range bar is the opening and not the close.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
By the way, I won't be trading until at least Wednesday this coming week, if then, because the first 2 days of the week are bank holidays for GBP, CAD, NZD, AUD and a few others. I may wait until a week from Monday.

1ST LOSS

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I've read through this thread and it's evolving very fast, can't afford to miss a day with this action. Anyway, I have these thoughts: 1) How was the first open price chosen, since this first one is determining the outlook and look of the range bars and especially the open price of all subsequent bars? 2) In the first post it says that this system is a price action system. But you guys aren't looking at the price action, just some numbers +- around some golden price derived somehow. It feels more like magic than price action trading too me. Draw an arbitrary line (which will be your open price) on a 1 minute chart, if price goes between 20 and 25 pips above or below and then returns to the arbitrary line enter a trade and the takeprofit will be (50 - whatever price traveled to trigger the trade) pips. See the picture below. This is similar to the rules, so could we trade this way as well? I just want to write this as a caution ahead. Please disregard my comments if they are out of line. I see some merit to this system, but I have another take on it, but won't clutter this thread with those thoughts or somewhere else as it may take too much time and I don't have that time at the moment. Hopefully you guys find something that will work for you.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Can this system be traded on Crude Oil futures?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I AM ON fxdd and the time on the bar is that of the close (I checked it with the price on the 5 min bar at the indicated time). The bar starts at the time of the previous bar close. As with back checking, and indeed forward checking, no two traders are going to obtain the same results as the trigger, entry and tp/stoploss levels are dependent on the price at the opening of the first bar on each individual platform. This price will be different, so on one trader's screen the new range bar will at, say, 1.5032 but the next trader's new bar might not start until 1,5040 (purely depending on the price level the currency is at when the Range Bar indicator is initially activated on the chart). This problem arose in the good old C4/Renko threads and was solved by anchoring the Renko bars at a specified level (05, 10, 15 etc. ) but the range bar indicator does not seem capable of being anchored. This is going to result in a few disagreements as someone who checks one weeks trading, and who's first range bar opens xx35 is going to give a completely different set of results from someone who's first range bar opens at xx45. It probably works out even in the long run, but just be aware that if I check the period 1 - 3rd Dec I am going to come up with a cpmpletely different result from JdD as my first bar opening is at a different time and price from his. JdD's backtesting indicate that using the end of the bar as the T/P results in less than a 1:1 t/p ratio (4 losses totaling 80 pips as opposed to 8 wins totaling 152 pips). I will carry out a similar backtest over a different period and use the same criteria as JdD (i will also calculate the difference if we leave the t/p at 30 pips rather than the end of the bar). As this method is still in it's infancy we might as well think outside the box.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Guys, I think the formula we can adhere to when reporting results can be as follows: num of wins/num of losses x TP/SL = Profit Factor (x) a PF of over about 1.1 should take into accounts spread and anything below that would be a strategy providing negative expectancy during your testing period . We should focus on x and optimize that variable. The greater it is the higher expectancy we have of any system. One thing you can try is to find SL you can set SL to 0 and see what the highest drawdown was (similar to was Mt4 backtester does to calculate PF). This will allow us to see what SL would get us a higher win/loss ratio. You can then set that drawdown as your SL say 5% equity and see if your PF is over 1.1 so you can trade... example: month of july you have no SL and figure out the highest drawdown was 100 pips and you won 10 trades. That means you won every trade 100% win/loss but your TP/SL is something like 10/100.. so thats a PF of 1 (10/1 x 0.1).. You would need atleast 11 wins to have positive expectancy to trade in August with those odds. If in August you sustain a DD of 100 pips you should see it return back to TP and then you can recalculate your PF to see if its worth trading anymore. You can set a hard SL at 200 pips since double your max drawdown really shouldn't happen unless your strategy really doesn't work for the period you tested. I hope you guys follow. I would like to see a report of PF rather then hey I won 6 in a row (but with what R:R?) This will give us a better report. Jag

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Yes but you can apply the same rules to get your PF from live trading... if your live trading and backtest results match.. then you have a good indication of where you stand.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Jag, much wisdom here. Thank you. As I've mentioned, this is exactly what I will be testing. I use "Trading Journal Spreadsheets" which provide exactly this information, and I always and only trade live (small lots). So I will be providing the results of my testing to all. I've promised my wife I would try 20 trades and then give the results .

--- 帖子 #177 ---
NowAndLater, you're exactly right on what you've written here; the first price is simply random, like drawing a horizontal line on the chart (I do know one person who trades with exactly this--a horizontal line on the chart). And yes, as said on the first page, we will all get different results based on prices of range bars differing, broker quotes, etc. All this was said on the first page. All I've done is noted something on the chart, call it a method of trading a horizontal line if you like, and am setting out to prove that it is either profitable or not profitable. Thought I'd invite you guys to come along and see with me .

--- 帖子 #178 ---
20 trades aren't statistically significant, you know? Well designed! Keep it up! FXcube

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes, I do know that 20 trades are not statistically significant, however, they are indeed constitutionally significant. In other words, my constitution (my makeup) cannot take losing any more than a certain amount .

here is an article which supports dreamliners devision of the range bars for risk reward clearly shown its for e minis and the forex interesting some points may help beginners understand dreamliners great ideas BUT GOOD READING OVER THE XMAS BREAK from BRIAN

sorry blue arrows long red lines vertical short trend prediction blue long future predictions

--- 帖子 #184 ---
JDB, thank you for running this test. I am confused about the results though. Many targets you show are from 10-20, but this can't be possible with the method I'm describing. I think what your test shows is that you did not put in a maximum pip range for the trade, only a minimum. This is probably because I have not described the system clearly enough. Let me try to do so: When the market drops 20 (actually 17-25) it triggers us to put on a buy stop order at the open of the bar. However, we also put a trigger to let us know if the market drops beyond our 20 trigger to 25. If it does drop to 25 we cancel our buy order because our reward/risk would not be acceptable below 25. It was clear to me that you did not put this maximum drop in, because there were some take profits of 10 pips. This means that the market dropped 40 pips then came up to the open and went to take profit of 10 pips when the bar closed. So we must have not only a minimum drop (or rise) of 20 (I'm using 17) but also a maximum drop (or rise) of 25. Granted this limits our number of trades we will take, but it keeps our R:R in an acceptable range. I hope this is clearer.

WHAT THE POINT MAN---

--- 帖子 #186 ---
dead wrong-- my manually back test from december 1st to december 8 (only 1 bar on the 8th more bars to do) i have -- 11 trades -- 10 win 1 loss all tp are minimum 20 pips -- 200 pips in 10 bars --- one one want to do what i am doing so there result are not accurate

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Zamanib, I have figured out how to back test! I've only done 6 bars so far, but all 6 were winners. The time you see on the range bar is indeed the END time of that bar, not the start time. In order to see when a bar started, put your cursor over the previous bar. At least that is the way it is on my chart.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
This are the winners-- 1 loss -- from dec 1 -- 8 (more bars to do on the 8) 11 trades 1 loss

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Sell trigger is 15422 almost there

--- 帖子 #190 ---
We are selling at 15402

--- 帖子 #191 ---
zamanib are u sure u have the rules correct? I thought if price dropped the correct pending order would be a BUY STOP at 422...not a sell. Dream what is correct here?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
this chart will help you -- pending to sell (if price touch 15433 no trade cancel pending)

--- 帖子 #193 ---
ok yes I see that is right, I misunderstood u.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yes Odysseus, that is correct. Zamanib, the market drops 20 (17-25) and we place pending BUY orders, not sell. Is this what you are doing? Have you been backtesting it like this?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Ah my bad, you are right Zam, the market went UP 20 pips from open and you placed a sell...you got it right, sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I'm going to backtest all of November during the coming week, if I have time. Just letting you know so we don't duplicate the backtesting.

so far no winners for me on demo. I must be doing it wrong still.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
How are you improving this system-- I see by rubbing your system is improving this system --- we are not kids here man if you want to improve this system and this thread please do but dont bring a different system and say u are improving it

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I don't know if you are "doing it wrong still" or not, but I can tell you that the strategy outlined in this thread does not have an edge. From post #4: I have done the backtests and can guarantee you will not "see profitable trades on nearly every bar." In fact, you will see a net loss. But this is just my opinion. There are others who feel this strategy is very profitable. Well, I guess we'll just have to stay tuned to see how it turns out.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I can confirm from my own backtest of the op's original system with original inputs that it is a net loss. That being said, there are some values that do prove out. For instance (all testing done on futures contracts) GBP 30 pip range bars do better with a 40 pip profit target and 20 pip stop loss than the original 20/10. But 30 pip range bars on GBP aren't the best setting either. And it seems to work better on some currencies other than GBP. I'll let you guys do your own homework but I just wanted to chime in that yes the original system with its original values doesn't have an edge but making some slight modifications to system logic may be a worthwhile exercise. ty dreamliner!

--- 帖子 #207 ---
looks like me and dreamliner are the only one seeing positive result-- I HOPE MY BACKTESTING IS CLEAR HOW I DO -- YOU CANNOT POSSIBLE BACK TEST WITH OUT GOING MANUALLY

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi guys nice job! Lets fwd test and live to see really if it works.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I also see positive results manually but with 1 difference. The TP is fixed and not taken by the Close of the bar. I don't have any XLS file or picture. sorry.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I was wrong to say "you will see profitable trades on nearly every bar." The majority of bars we skip.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thank you for your comments. We have gone to 50 pip range bars. I have also tested EUR/JPY and EUR/USD with equal success.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Can you explain how you are testing? I assume you mean that you are backtesting on a demo account, correct? If so what is your minimum and maximum number of pips to trigger a buy or sell order?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
We must test ever 50 pips range bars for backtesting look for example what happen-- look the chart you will see it is not a tradeable bar

--- 帖子 #214 ---
It was a tradeable bar and it was a loss

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Zam, on post 238 you say "it was not a tradeable bar", on post 239 you say "it was a tradeable bar, it was a loss." It looks like you are highlighting the exact same bar. I'm confused.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
For back testing -- i have to do it over again -- and test ever bars- the 11 bars that i tested they are accurate and correct all i need to do is to test ever bars for december-- i also see it can be done on a 5pips rangebar or a 1pip range bar then the time are the same -- we dont have to worring in matching up rangebars time with the regular 5mins chart time here are the rules from open price---20 pips above or below trigger line no trade if price move above or below the open price 31 pips or more once enter trade sl will be high / low of the current bar exit will be close of the bar so sl will be between 20-30 pips tp will be 20-30 pips see the 5pips range chart

--- 帖子 #217 ---
all bars are tradeable once it met the rules-- i give example what happen -- by looking at 50 pips rangebars you cannot tell if it is tradeable (it seems not tradeable ) but it was we must test every 50 pips bars -- we cannot see the movement unless we go to 1pips range or 5 pip range

--- 帖子 #218 ---
OK I see what you are saying; you are saying it LOOKED like it was not a tradeable bar, but when you backtested it it was tradeable and was a loss, and we should test every single bar. I agree.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
what i meant by looking at it -- it seems not a tradeable bar -- but it was look at 5mins or the 5pips rangebar

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Zamanib Thanks for your diligence in testing this strategy. I am following this thread closely and trading in demo. We have a potential trade on current bar going long on FXDD. We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
No longer tradable - price went outside 30 pip zone.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Zam, Dream: I need to know what rules i have to use for backtesting. Actually 2 options: 1.- Zam Rules (see post below). 2.- Dream Rules: Post 202: "So we must have not only a minimum drop (or rise) of 20 (I'm using 17) but also a maximum drop (or rise) of 25. Granted this limits our number of trades we will take, but it keeps our R:R in an acceptable range". Please, tell me the best rules for backtesting. Th. JdD

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Nice we need more like you to test--- no trade on this bar exceed the range 20--to 30 pips above or below open price

--- 帖子 #224 ---
do DREAM 1ST HIS 17 --25 MINIMUM MAXIMUM MINE IS 20--30

--- 帖子 #225 ---
sorry you beat me to it good -- you understand our testing

--- 帖子 #226 ---
nice to see a method based on price action, instead of another cookie clutter dozen indicator template.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
This system takes patience to trade but with an alert system you don't have to spend alot of time in front of the computer. I'm using 17-31 pips as my trade zone. I'm sure that it will take time and testing to refine that range.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
That's exactly right. I've seen statistics that say no indicator has ever proven to be profitable; that has been true for me for sure.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Thanks Chazbo, let us know how you do as able. I'm completing the first 4 days of November, going bar by bar on the 1 minute chart to see exactly what happened in the 50 bars. It's tedious but the results are confirming the method.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Good Things happen to those who wait.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Range bars can be backtested in visual mode if the proper steps are taken. If you could, please refresh post 1 with the latest up to date rules (size of rangebar, amount min/max of movement before pending trade set, tp amount/sl amount), and I will try to find time to manually backtest to verify some of your results.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi Tazmaan, I've been trying to update the first post but cannot find a way to do so. The "edit" button is now gone, I guess it has a time-limit to it or something. If anybody knows how to edit posts that don't have an edit button let me know. We're doing 50 pip range bars, with 17-25 (me--20-30 Zam) triggers.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
WHAT TREND -- DO YOU SEE ANY TREND go ahead man you are desparate post your system on this thread and all you live trades while we are killing ourselves to see is this system is profitable or not by backtesting and forward testing

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks DL, what stoploss/target are you now using? 20sl 30tp? And no, sorry I don't know why u wouldnt be able to edit your post

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Bring up your original post and click on "Thread Tools". Then click on"Edit Thread Options". Your post will come up looking like the layout when you originally typed it. You can change it from there as if you were typing it for the first time. You'll need to click the "Save Changes" button underneath the post. I just tried it on a very old one of mine and it worked. Anything after the first post has a time limit though.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Regarding stops and targets, it depends. Let's say we're going long, which means the market dropped by our minimum requirement to trigger a buy stop. As soon as our order is filled (which obviously means the market came back up to the open price) we look and see the difference between the low to the open. Let's say it's 20 pips. We then set our target at 30 (which is end of bar). Let's say the low to the open was 24, we set our target at 46 (end of bar). If the low to open was 18 we set a 32 pip target, and if the low to open was 25 we set a 25 pip target. Does that make sense?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Yeah makes sense. Or just end of bar exit looks to end up the same. So not going for a set RR each trade, sometimes it turns out &lt;1:1 sometimes a little more. By the way, did some searching for a free alert method for this, and this thread is worth a peek http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=15197 post 1, 23 and 49, enjoy

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thanks Bill; unfortunately I didn't put the system on the first post but on the third or fourth. I would have done that differently if I could.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I think you have to average your R:R just like you average your win percentage... then use your in sample test and forward test it on out of sample data... the parameters that will win are the ones who have the highest PF between the in/out sample. The longer the test the higher expectancy.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Are you soft in the head ?? 1 Pip Range Bar does not exist. At a very minimum you will need 2 Pips to determine a bar.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Nice indicator. I like it. Wicks are extremely important on Range Bars. Especially on Bigger Pip Interval Bars. They give a very good indication of "Potential Turning Points" in the market.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thanks Tazmaan, I'll look at the post with the alerts. I really like the alerter I put on the second or third post but I'm always interested in looking at others too. For me the R:R will never be less than 1:1, but Zam is doing slightly less than that; we'll just keep testing.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Dreamliner... let me get this right in my head. Bar Opens. Price goes up "x" Pips ----&gt; Buy Limit at the Bar Open Price? Price goes down "x" Pips ----&gt; Sell Limit at the Bar Open Price? Set SL / TP combination at "Y" / "Z" ( Y and Z some yet to be determined combination as determined by Backtesting ) Correct?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
You could copy and paste it into the first post and change it there. Then have Twee remove the post where it is now.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Wow this backtesting stuff is time intensive if you do every 50 pip range bar by hand, going through each minute bar to see what *really* happens. Here are the results of my backtesting from November 1-4 (see attached for pic): 27 bars tested 18 No-Trade bars (NT) 9 Wins 0 Losses Total pips: 224 net (spread of 2.5 figured in to each trade). Obviously with this small of a sampling nothing much can be determined; I'd like to have 100 bars just to get started with, but I've done enough backtesting for now (my eyes are crossing ).

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hello Musashi, Actually it's opposite: Bar opens Price goes up "X" Pips-----&gt;Sell Stop at the Bar Open Price Price goes down "X" Pips------&gt;Buy Stop at the Bar Open Price SL is always bar low on a long and bar high on a short. TP is always end of bar. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Wow looks good DL! Have you taken any live ones yet this week?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Very nice ZZ I have it running now. I assume it will label a trade's result once it shows one as being taken? Nice tool for forward testing, thanks

--- 帖子 #249 ---
No, I haven't because of the bank holidays this week. I might do some on Wednesday, or I may just wait until next Monday.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Yes perfect sense. Currently you are testing x=? x&gt; some value and x&lt; some value?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yes, I'm testing X=17 to 25 and Zam is testing 20-30. I just don't want to have less than a 1:1 R:R so I'm stopping at 25.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Please open a new thread for the testing of any EA's. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Yea that's a good idea most likely increases PF.. Jag

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Take profit is always end of bar.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yup I answered my own question by reading a few posts up

--- 帖子 #256 ---
So x=17-25 implies that for a short trade there must be an upper wick of at least 17 pips but no greater than 25 pips right? and for a long trade there must be a lower wick of at least 17 pips but no greater than 25 pips right ? If price goes to 17 Pips you then put your sell/buy stops into the market and then if price goes above the 25 pips before your order is hit you then remove the order until the next bar opens?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
So from what I see, should be in a short trade on GU right now.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Yup on a bar size of 52 my SL is something like 1.5484 and it entered short... the EA actually didn't work for me so I'm just eying it for now. Would have been good to release the source instead of an EX4... oh well I'll have to decompile it.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
the ea doesnt actually take trades, just marks entries etc for testing purposes. Notice the sl is incorrect on mine, already sent zz a pm about it since apparently there's no discussion about it on here (a shame)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I see... no markings here though

--- 帖子 #261 ---
The reason there is no discussion about it here is because of what is already taking place: the discussion turning to the EA rather than the method. Pretty soon there will be a version 2.0 then a version 2.1, etc. etc. This thread will literally be hijacked by discussions from people asking how to set the EA up, how to load it on a chart, oh no mine doesn't work, what do I do? So no, it is not a shame to keep that discussion out of here when our objective is to test the method. I'm not opposed to an EA whatsoever, just needs to be another thread. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Guys, I have asked nicely. Please take any discussion about an EA to another thread.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
That is exactly right. Zam is testing 20-30 and I'm testing 17-25.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Stop loss is the low of the bar on a long and the high of the bar on a short, up to the cancel level of 25.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
As long as the thread does not become tech support for an indicator, or EA. Thank you for your work.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yes I couldn't agree more.... in any sort of backtesting using a piece of software to assist has to be extremely useful. Especially for this type of methodology.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I was thinking... the high and low of the bar is a good place to stop but for myself I would also add 5 pips buffer for stop loss hunting aswell as genuine trend continuation.. we know there will be a high chance of a reversal but we have to allow room to breathe for our trade. If the criteria gets you atleast 1:1 R:R then I would take it. However that would limit our entry from 17-20 pips only so not place to enter... you can increase the TP to make a 1:1 trade if you really want the 17-25 entry. I think this may get us more positive trades if our entry criteria is good. The SL is the thing I think needs improvement.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
R:R will never be less than 1:1 the way I trade it. Zam will get slightly less than that.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Are you trading only one order per bar?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Yes, I am. I am going to be adding other pairs too, though. EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi DL, Yes... but personally I like to take stop loss hunting into account.. thus for me the rules will be different.. todays trade seems like a bigger and bigger reversal is imminent.. but also the original 1:1 with 17-25 is intact. Lets see if this 5 pip buffer comes into play. Jag

--- 帖子 #272 ---
What are you on about when you say stop loss hunting? Define stop loss hunting on a price chart?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Alright, keep us informed. I was scared to trade with the bank holidays, but then again I didn't take that, or news, into account when backtesting.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Ok I'll try to illustrate using todays trade as an example. The high is in place and weak shorts (retail) are in with the high as SL. SM then shakes out the weak shorts since most of the SL's are placed at the high to reserve their R:R. A pop above the high often occurs when weak money accumulates the SL int he same spot. The reversal still comes but the weak money isn't there to profit. Jag

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I understand what you are saying but I don't necessarily agree... Weak Shorts... then Supposedly Smart Money takes out the Weak Shorts.... This way of thinking is total garbage...

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Why do you say that? You don't believe the contrarian play has been a driving force in the market for the last 10 years? My idea is based on market theory and principles that drive PA today... what's your stand on why it would be garbage to allow weak money to profit? Everyone can see there is a high in with lower highs and lower lows happening.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
It matters not what drives the price action my friend. All that matters is the price action.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
But when you decide to use SL and TP do you not place a bet on where you think the price action will go? Therefor you introduce a variable that is not under your control and you are assuming you have picked the direction of events. Those events are controlled externally and thus would lead you to make a hypothesis on how those events happen or take place. Well it would make me sleep better at night anyway

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Like I said I don't try to rationalize anything in this market, what's the point. Probabilities is all that matters. Probabilities based on what has happened before and what is likely to happen again. Which is what this thread is all about. The rest... is well... pointless..

--- 帖子 #280 ---
This is very true. What I have yet to figure out though, is what is the edge that this system has? We are basically saying if the market goes up "some" enter a sell stop back where it started to go up in hopes that it will keep going down. What kind of an edge is that? And yet I can't deny that there is indeed probability, which is very noticeable in backtesting. Still I wish we could put our finger on what the "edge" is with this system, if any. Any takers?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I'm trying it on demo in real time. I've missed a few possible trades waiting on the current bar to update, this can take hours or minutes. But doing this live has given me 1 winner and 4 losses so far. Sometimes the open goes both ways very fast and you miss a trade, or it goes down but never back to open.. its not easy. Also keep in mind my times of trading are not best. I'm west coast usa so I get the crappy sessions An indicator that places the sl tp and entry lines both ways after open I guess would help. I see the merit in this trading idea. I'm just not paying attention or getting tired of staring at screen. I'm sure its me so far.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I see, yes it's difficult to stare at the screen waiting. Have you tried the alerter I mentioned on the first page? I'm hoping that will help so we don't have to stare at the screen.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I like how you do your lines.. A indy that does this for us would be faster but maybe I'm just lazy and don't like to add and subtract.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I think someone has coded an EA that prints the lines on the chart for you already. If I'm not mistaken.

--- 帖子 #285 ---

my 1st live trade -- sell trigger was activated 20 pips 15467 open move up 15487 -- move back down 15467 i enter -- then it move back 15487 i set my sl 30 pips plus 4 pips spread so 15501 sl that my entry 15467 -- tp 15437 sl 15501 i was a success that was the last bar -- looking to enter if the next bars give up a trade

hey dreamliner, nice seeing you here with a new system, i will be following this thread closely, i always appreciated your views on the market especially on the correlation hedge thread.. keep it up and have a nice new year

--- 帖子 #292 ---
This was a perfect trade.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi iTrader, thank you for the kind comments, and I hope you can contribute here as well.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
This was perfect too, Zam. What are you doing about spread? Are you adjusting your numbers at all for it, or just entering and letting spread take care of itself?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
the last 3 bars - 2 of them winners -- the other no trade the current bar may be a possible trade sell tigger happen already now waiting to go shot one price come to 15459 yes i set my sl 30 pips plus 4 for spread -- i try to enter on the exact price -- if i set pending to enter to buy -- then i will add the spread

--- 帖子 #296 ---
So you've got 2 winners and 1 NT on a live account, correct? Zam I think you are paying too much for spread. I don't know who your broker is but Oanda 's spread is just 2 right now. If you're paying 4 that would cut your overhead in half.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I am happy with fxsol --- and MIG I like fsxol 4ditig -- I sent you and email yes live trade

--- 帖子 #298 ---
been following this thread..... just being sure .. you are placeing buy or sell stops not limits correct? I feel I understand everything else.. I just can't get the M2 and range bars to work I've done it before but I'm with a different broker now. That could be the problem

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Dryclean, yes when the trigger goes off we are placing buy stops (if triggered short) and sell stops (if triggered long). Unless you are on Oanda and then they call all orders that are not market orders "limit" orders. I can't help you on the range bars, but if you search on range bars in forex factory there are a number of threads where you can get questions answers. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I like it... a small test on a live account (IBFX). Worked like a charm on the AUDUSD 30pip range bars.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi Crodzilla, Yes, I am convinced it will work on any/all pairs. And we can even keep the range the same on all pairs, believe it or not due to the fact that we really have no edge here (at least that I can see). I'm sticking with GBP/USD and EUR/USD for simplicity sake, but am planning on going to EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY and AUD/USD as soon as I can.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I have an EA that I built for constant range bars, using a similar strategy. But, if I remember correctly, I didn't define how far beyond the previous bar price had to go, and I opened a new trade at the open of a new bar, instead of opening a stop order for the open of the previous bar. It was barely profitable, not really enough to put any more time into. And, it didn't really have good MM. So, your strategy seems very well thought out, and would seem to catch the reversal early.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Excellent thoughts, thank you very for your comments.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I just did my first live trade on GBP/USD and was a loss for 27 pips including spread. Interesting to have 9 winners in a row in backtesting and the first live trade a loss. Continuing on...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
got range bar to work and placed a sell stop it hit then hit tp 20 pips in a few minutes timing is everything LOL

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Good for you! I'll have to learn from you!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
EUR/USD hit 27 pip target (middle chart)

--- 帖子 #308 ---
even a blind squril finds the nut I wonder if there is a script file that can place a buy and sell stop 10 pips from market with the TP 20 and Sl 10 in it I'll look in my bag of tricks for it not sure I have it

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Just gave it all back on a buy stop LOL see I told ya don't follow my lead

--- 帖子 #310 ---
This time going for the reversal Update Stopped Out - 19 pips

--- 帖子 #311 ---
3 winners today -- I was off the pc for a few hrs my last trade hit tp -- I am looking at the current bar -- to trade ok sell trigger activate 15468 look so sell at 15648

--- 帖子 #312 ---
my rules is a little different than DL I posted before anyways --- here you go from open price 20 above or below is trigger line not exceed 30 pips sl is 30 pips plus spread no trade if exceed 30 pips tp on the closing of the bar

--- 帖子 #313 ---
last bar not trade - exceed 30 pips

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Zamanib... The second trade if you took the trade with the current bar low as the SL you would have hit SL.. but with the LOW - a few pips buffer for SL it would be a W ... your 30 pip SL here came through. I'm thinking of taking TP such that I get 2:1 R:R ratio... so don't close at bar end but when your 2:1 ratio plays out. Win % might take a hit but you don't even need 50% win rate to be positive here. Dreamliner... was this the trade you got hit with SL? I bet your SL was hunt down lol

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I will not do anymore - back test and will only trade live -- this will be my foward testing - I am convince with the few back test I did . this a profitable system more win than loss -- I dont care about win loss ratio on one single bar -- my sl is 30 plus sprd pips my tp to from 20 --30 pips depend on the high or low

--- 帖子 #316 ---
What do you mean win loss on a single bar? You have to average this over time. With your set up I think you would need 75% win rate to be profitable. Your SL is say 31 pips and TP is say 19-29 pips. Best case is 31/29 you need about 57% win rate to BE.. worsed case is 31/19 (need 88% win rate to BE).. average 72.5% just to BE... If you don't look at this you will be wasting time. I think its a good idea to find a way to test the system and optimize based on strategy and input parameters.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
So you are looking for candles that will end up having a wick of between 20-30 pips but no more than 30 correct?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
So current bar on EU 50 Pip Range would be a Trade Bar presuming the low of this bar does not go down more?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Musashi, I can't see any numbers on that chart so it is hard to tell just by eyeballing it. If it has dropped between 20-30 you would set a buy stop at the open. Zam do you use a flat 30 pips stop loss on all trades, or do you adjust based upon how many pips to entry that you got in the trade at?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Yes it has the bottom indicator is the Wick Measuring Indicator which has horizontal lines on it at ranges of 20 to 30 and -20 to -30 Doing a quick visual backtest it appears that there's potential for a winning system here. However it is difficult to know what the price action is in each of those bars to really determine profitability. However just looking at those particular bars it appears most of them are winning trades. However I see quite a few bars where the pip range of the wick is bigger than 30 Pips and it's difficult to know if price gets you into a trade then reverses past your stop and then closes in the direction of the initial trade.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Yes, that is the whole purpose of this thread on Forex Factory. You are seeing what I saw, potential for a winning system, but not knowing exactly what price action is doing in between the open and close. I don't ever trade if the pip range is bigger than 30, in fact I don't trade if it's bigger than 25 (Zam goes to 30).

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Current GU 50 Pip bar fits your criteria I believe.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Pip bars are going to be totally different based upon open prices and start times. I don't currently have a GBP/USD signal, mine GBP/USD is directly in the middle of the bar with not very big tails. By the way, I almost called this tread "Tail Traders Treasure" meaning that each bar had to have a tail .

--- 帖子 #324 ---
On my GoTrader Live Account I see it falls in your 20-25 Pip range, most of the bars with a Wick in that range are winners that I can see since the middle of December.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
JForex allows 10 pip bars(max) we can actually backtest it with accuracy... I'll work on a strategy so that it can work with x sized bars with 10 pips as the base.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Yep, that's what I saw too.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Let us know. I'm now trading it live with EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, USD/CHF, EUR/GBP, USD/JPY. Starting with just 7 pairs. All pairs backtest the same. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yup it would be good to compare some trades to see if we get the same ones... One prob with the range bar indi is I think that it uses whatever history it has... but I think it should reset at the start of each week. This will offset all the bars in the chart. We will have to compare afterwards Jag

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Here is a script file that need to be re-coded Right now it places a buy stop and a sell stop with tp's and sl's It need to be changed to a buy limit and sell limit to work according to DL's rules Anyone out there know how to code and fix it makes placing trade easy I've played with it but I'm not a coder will keep trying Also attached a newbar alter indi beeps with a new bar

--- 帖子 #330 ---
No, we only use buy stop and sell stop orders, unless you are using Oanda , and they call their orders "Limit" orders unless it is a "Market" order. So all MT4 orders will be buy stop and sell stop orders.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
well that makes it easy this does that now just adjust the inputs if you are using a 30 or a 50 bar this is set for a 50

--- 帖子 #332 ---
this is an excellent trading approach for the euro using a 30 pip bar using a 10SL and a 20 TP. I do recommend using some MA'S or Keltner Channels to add price support so you have some reason of expectations for which direction you should be trading. that is how I'm using it and the winning % imoproves dramatically when trading with the trend instead of against it

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Just through something together to see what an automated indicator would act like. I am using I believe Zam's settings, they are on the chart. The info at the left gives an idea of what is going on. It should open and close fake trades and keep a running score of PIPS gain and loss. I just started it so it probably has some bugs. As you can see it hasn't even hit the Buy or Sell triggers yet. This is a M5 chart. I will let it run and see what happens. If it works out I will post it for all to use if you think it will be of any use. It has a gross look right now but the final one if it works will be cleaned up and all the info will be moved to the right side of the chart, this setup is just for testing and was easy to throw together quickly. You can see the PIP count is still only 18, with a MAX set to 30 PIPS. All settings will be able to be set in the indicator so we can test different settings. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
All you really need to display on the Chart is if the price has moved more than "x" pips since the open of the bar and less than "y" pips since the open of the bar. Then you'll know if you need to open an order or not.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I did exactly the same, except used stop orders, and traded it live for a while until I realised it wasn't doing much. The added little twist of using the previous bar's open might make it profitable. I was also using ATR to work out a recommended bar size.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
So what happened then... you gave up? Try a 500 hour ATR

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The idea is not to set and watch the charts to see if the system works. The program runs unattended and Buys and Sells according to the rules. After letting it run for 24 hours I can look and see how many 30 PIP bars there were and how many PIPS were Gained or Loss on those bars. Best part is I can go to bed while this is all going on and sleep through it. All the present numbers on the chart are just for debugging purposes to see if the program is calculating things correctly.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Yes indeed..... there's not too many 50 pip bars in a single trading day since the ADR for most pairs right now is around 150 pips.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I see a potential trade on GU 50R bar right now.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
But how did you decide which candle to start with on the 5m? But keep us posted

no trigger yet-- plus once there is trigger price must retrace to open price

can you post your chart --- what are you looking at I dont see a trigger on my chart

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Price moved higher than the open price by 12 pips then put sell stop into market.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Dreamliner Thanks for your hard work. In your backtesting, did you find equal success with with Trend Continuation trades (trend being defined as same direction as previous bar) and Reversals (opposite direction of previous bar)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Did the ranging thing and stopped me out. No way to stop that sort of thing happening.

Entered Short again off of my standard chart using the 7R bars like i normally do.... Price breaking out of that congestion zone now...

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I am not sure what range -- and what ur rules -- 20--30 pips above or bleow is trigger then enter on the retrace to the open price this last candle exceed the 30 pips range no trade

--- 帖子 #349 ---
30 pip range from where to where?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
the rules are so simple , why are you asking again? just go to previous posts and READ the thread is being overloaded with unnecessary posts

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Yes I have seen he is using 20-30 pip price movement from the open price before he will enter a pending order.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
yes , the rules are simplest as 123 , a 9 year old kid can get them easily: movement of 20 pips from open price = put pending order from open to the opposite side movement of 30 pips from opens price makes the pending invalid SL =30+spread TP=close of bar thats it, now we need to test the win rate of it , if its something from 80% and above - we have good system here, because R:R is around 1:1 win rate od below 80% would be profitable but hard to trade psychologically

--- 帖子 #353 ---
EU current 50R bar fits that's criteria my friend.

My BackTesting 1-10 December results with Dream Rules: GBPUSD Range Bar: 50 Pips SL: Close Range Bar TP: Close Range Bar Trigger Pending Order: Open Price between + - 17 and 25 Pips (Dream Rules).

Has anyone had any success backtesting range bars as per the youtube video instructions: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks Musashi for your update on this. I tried to run one simple EA but it did not work. Not sure what could be the problem with my EA. Is it possible for you to share any EA which worked for you on offline chart? Please let me know.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Use the Sample MACD EA it works for me. Any EA should work....

--- 帖子 #362 ---
What I hav e seen is EA take bars from the original Chart that is M1 chart and not from offline M2 bars. I think it worked for you but it may have taken bar OHLC values from M1 chart. I experimented with this to see that if bars on which EA works is from offline chart bars OR bars from original live M1 chart by putting Alert in EA for change in Open[0] value or Time[0] value. And I could see clearly that I was getting Alert for every minute where if it had followed bars from offline chat would have given Alert for every bar change in offline chat which would be variable time. If you have EA on offline chart and dont follow the offline bar chart values then it is of no use. Hope I am able to explain what I mean by actual working of EA on offline chart.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Having bought the commercial Constant Range Bars script I can confirm that the instructions given on the website FAQs for backtesting with CRB do work and from memory the youtube instructions seem to replicate the method of setting it up. There is no Optimisation available, you have to alter 1 factor in your EA each time you run it, so it's time consuming, but still quicker than manually backtesting.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
put the Alert on both the M1 chart and the Rangebar chart? And did you check which Alert was triggered against the pop-up box showing which chart the Alert came from? All EAs/Indies/Alerts I have used with Constant Range Bar charts have worked perfectly well. Maybe you have set up your offline charts differently, but in any case these questions are in contravention of the wishes of the OP and it would be better, if you wish to pursue the issue, to open a thread in the Platform Tech section.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I am not sure how you do it-- but when I try to run strategy test -- then period to test --- only option available are 1min 5min 15min 1hr 4rh and daily I do not see any offline chart -- may you can tell us how you do it

--- 帖子 #366 ---
These rules are exactly right, with the only exception that I do not use a 30 pip fixed stop (Zam does, though). Instead I just make the stop the low (for longs) or high (for shorts) of the bar that triggered the order.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
current bar -- no trade exceed 30 pips

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Dear friends, Well I really hate to say this, but from now on anyone who posts about an EA will be banned from the thread. I know that is a hard line, but I was serious in my very first post stating that this thread is for the method only and no discussion of EAs will be allowed. Look, I'm really not a mean guy, and I am very happy to see EA's developed for this method in a new thread. It is just that we who have been around Forex Factory a long time know that threads started with seemingly good systems degenerate into "Tech Support" questions about EA's, then the EA developer posts additional updated EAs, then pretty soon we don't even know if the method is valid because the thread is all about EAs. So come on, please be kind to me, and to others on this thread who just want to see if the method is a valid way of trading in a manual way, will you? My heart is not to ban anyone, but I will in order to keep focused on the purpose of this thread.

Hi Had my indicator set up on EURUSD last night and let it run to see what it would do. Not much action on this pair, it reports I had five 30 PIP range bars, does that sound about right? No Buy or Sells durring these 5. I am using your settings of +- 20 PIPs for triggers, 20 for TP and 30 for SL. Also it starts over if the Bar reaches 30 PIPs. Just a question. If you get a Buy or Sell do you let the trade go to the TP or still close it once the Bar reaches 30 PIPs? On a 30 PIP bar would a +- 10 PIP trigger work better? Tonight I am going to set up the indicator on more charts and try different settings to see what happens in real time. Maybe even try the indicator on more than one chart of the same pair with different settings. Good Luck

I know that is a hard line, but I was serious in my very first post stating that this thread is for the method only and no discussion of EAs will be allowed. Hi I appreciate what you are doing here and I hope I didn't step on any toes by talking about an indicator, that was not my intention. I was just trying to test your system in a more robotic way which eliminates the human +- entering into the testing. This is your thread and if you want to stick with strickly manual watching of the charts, thats fine with me. Keep the good ideas comming.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
No offense taken whatsoever my friend. I'm just wanting to keep the thread about the method and not about indicators/EAs. If you've been around here for any length of time you'll appreciate the reasoning behind this. I can't tell you how many threads have been hijacked by developers of EAs which turn in to Tech Support questions. You're just fine. By the way, my USD/JPY trade last night was a winner, so now I'm 1 for 1. My account balance has increased by almost 1% in the past 20 hours with that one win. And I even goofed up the target price and left 6 pips on the table. DOH! [quote=seller9;4272454]

Hi Dreamliner, Thank you for your contribution and really appreciated for the method which is purely based on price action. I wish this thread will continue with pure price action techniques. Good Trading!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thank you Hariusa, I hope that traders will benefit, please contribute as able.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Exactly right, nice find. This is how I have been doing it for well over a year now. Glad someone made a vid on howto On THIS method, you would use visual backtest mode, with something such as vhands to manually take the trades (since no ea's can be discussed here) to verify the method's results

--- 帖子 #385 ---
You also think wrong. As demonstrated in a youtube video a few posts ago EA backtesting on offline charts is possible. However, Dreamliner does not allow EAs in this thread (even for the only purpose of backtesting). I just tried it with the standard rules over 3 months. Unfortunately, not profitable. I will continue with different parameters. gary

Just got back from lunch and an errand... Added a few pennies profit from a EURUSD trade. This is working quite nicely.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
nice to see some of us piping

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I'm pipping too . It's been kind of a slow day today; none of the pairs I'm monitoring have given any trades. A few alerts but then canceled.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi Just wondering what you closed your trade on. It looks like it was on the next candle, so did you close it at your TP or the closing of the signal candle? Thanks

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Just wanted to update everybody on what I am now using for alerts. I had a friend contact me and tell me about smtp2go and said it worked great with MetaTrader's built in alert system. Sure enough it does. So I'm now using Metatrader's alerts with smtp2go if anyone would like to check them out. Again, this thread is about the method of trading known as MPAS, but in case any of you are needing help with alerts I thought I would share with you.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I just started a new thread here for those of you wishing to discuss EA's, indicators, etc. for this method. I hope it helps!

--- 帖子 #393 ---
My trade log is above the picture which includes my AUDUSD trade yesterday and the EURUSD trade today. The AUDUSD was a 20 pip TP (Set &amp; Forget). The EURUSD was a 20 pip +spread TP (Set &amp; Forget). I forgot about the spread on my first live trade.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Correct me if I'm wrong but AU current open 50R bar suits this strategy at the moment.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I think GU fit the criteria as well for a long trade. Wick fell within the 17-30 pip range.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I think I got it made 20 pips on GJ and Eu

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Yes, I am currently in this trade.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
You're doing well!

--- 帖子 #399 ---
current bar give 20 pips then drop back -- I miss the initial trade --but I think I will enter now -- price move back to open

--- 帖子 #400 ---
uj trade will be on once price hit open price again

--- 帖子 #401 ---
so , zamanib , what we can expect from this system? is it good enough ? is the win rate high ? say your opinion considering real trading results from last days

--- 帖子 #402 ---
this - is excellent system result are great -- live result is great -- I enter 3 live trade -- 30 20 24 pips--- 74 pips no loss so far - I try to trade live - when I am away from the pc for long time - I miss a few trades-- I have a next system that I trade also -- I am up about 400 pips for december this system -- I did not share on forum I dont need this new system -- but I see great potential in it -- so I will only trade these 2 system now-- and only trade one currency gbpusd I dont look at other pairs forex -- trading need discipline - patient -- and time-- these is not fast money -- stick with you rules - and you will do ok--

--- 帖子 #403 ---
pipping a next 26 pips total 30 20 24 26 == 100 pips 4 trades this is excellent stuff

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I was away from the screen I couldn't close the trade at the end of the bar, and it missed the TP I had set by 3 pips. Price turned and ended up being a loss. Otherwise it would of been a winner if I closed the trade at the end of the bar. Doh... turns out there's a bar two bars later that could possibly of turned out to be another winner if I was around as well. Oouch...

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I got it as win -- the previous 24 pips I set tp 15534 tp hit -- bar was 84-34 = 50 and the last bar was a winner 26 pips the current bar exceed 30 pips no trade on this bar

--- 帖子 #406 ---
This GBP/USD trade was another winner last night.

Hi!! I'm following the thread from some days..in the meanwhile I've coded a first verion of the EA...you can find it in the proper Thread with all explanations... I will not talk about the EA anymore in this thread...as per Dreamsliner's desire... This post is just to let you know of the first release Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thank you Chris, for your hard work on this. I hope it benefits those who wish to trade in that manner.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
No, that is code or something; the rules for the way we trade this system are on the first page.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Another winner - gu this rocks man 5 trades 124 pips

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Yep, try it with other pairs you'll get the same results and will have more opportunities. Are you doing 50 pip range bars or 30?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I think there was a loss: sell stop signal from 1.5477 , SL at 1.5509 was hit and the range bar closed the same time

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Zamanlib / Dreamliner, Thanks for sharing! I am curious in your live forward testing/trading are you restricting your trading to particular times of the day (for example only trade London open) and do you stand aside during news events?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Unlike most other systems that depend upon volume, I don't think it matters the time of day that you trade this method. I'm not going to trade right at news time just because of the increase of spreads , but I'll trade it anytime of day or night beside that.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Dreamliner, Great work and great idea. Thanks for sharing this idea.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thanks for your comments NetFX, and I hope it helps many of us.

Appreciate your time and contribution for backtesting of Price Bars.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi guys, started reading this yesterday, looks great and I am going to try these charts when the market next opens. I have played a bit with Constant Range Bar s so no problem there. But a question, isn't this a basic 1-2-3 pattern, but using range bars? and would it help to qualify trades or back tests by taking entries only in the direction of the MAJOR trend, eg. daily at the least? Regards, John http://www.ehow.com/how_5053946_spot...-patterns.html The 1-2-3 top or bottom can form at the top of a rally or the bottom of a decline, signaling a reversal in price movement. In the 1-2-3 bottom, the price rallies off of a market low and then pulls back to a level slightly higher than the low. Traders commonly enter the market when the price crosses back over the price level of the second point.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Searched but couldn't find "the proper Thread" that you speak of...could you provide the Name of this thread? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #421 ---
[quote] I think this is a important question in terms of results if you take round numbers into consideration as they work as kind of built in s/r levels. If you start with anchor at zero with 50 pip bars we can examine how these levels can be best utilized. Do we use them as opening price or straddle them? Thanks to all who have contributed thus far Q

--- 帖子 #422 ---
As far as I know there is no way to do this with range bars. This system just uses the range bars from wherever they start. [quote=JazzmanQ2;4279125]

[quote=Dreamliner;4279271]As far as I know there is no way to do this with range bars. This system just uses the range bars from wherever they start. I purchased commercially...does range bars and renko anchored at zero.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Since this thread showed up I have added RangeBars to my Renko Test Jig which I used to generate Renko History Charts for backtesting. 1. It can generate one chart at a time or up to 8 charts with different pip sizes at once. It is still in final debug but very close to complete. 2. Renko and RangeBar Charts are actually EYE CANDY and do not actually contain any info additional info - only less info. That is, the time domain is removed. 3. I never trade a system without first modeling it with a test jig. Those who claim that backtesting is a waste of time need to understand every forward test chart becomes a historical chart the instant the bar is complete. Any strategy that is so sensitive that it will work on a backtest and won't work live is too sensitive or tuned to current conditions that it is not a good strategy. Finally - I hate Strategytester and I spend more time on reconciling its results than working on my strategy. Here is a screen chart of what it looks like on my screen and I believe that it makes manual backtesting a snap, and programmed back testing even quicker. SoOOO - Dreamliner - Just say the word and and I will not post anything further and will keep my backtesting results to myself as I progress. Regards, KingHigh, Left Coast Programmer

One profitable trade on EJ this morning.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I got that one too.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Could you post a chart of the winning trade ?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Dreamliner, Thanks for sharing your strategy. I use Ninja Trader 6.5 and have completed an autostrategy to test your system with, but this post is NOT about strategies. I'm using the 17 - 25 which is the last parameters I saw you post. It will exit a position at the Close of a bar (50 Range). I think the Stop Loss is the only difference. You set your stop at the opposite end of the bar when a position is entered, but since I can't do that with this autostrat (runs tic by tic instead of on bar Close) I just have it exit the position on the Close of the bar (actually the first tic of a new 50 Range bar, Limit Order). It may cost an extra few tics from time to time on a Stop Loss compared to setting the Stop immediately, but the results are still positive. I've run the strat on the limited amount of data I have (Replay, which is almost exactly like Live) and it's been averaging around 25-50 pips a day (or partial day) for EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Tonight I started the Live SIM test with EUR/USD, GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY. This strat will trade every bar that qualifies, so it should be happily taking trades when I'm asleep. I'll post the results after the end of this week. Again, thanks for sharing. My few tests in Live Data Replay show positive, positive, positive so it's definitely worth pursuing! With enough of us testing, it should show if the system has validity or not. Joe Wellsville, Utah

--- 帖子 #431 ---
nice job pecunix, ninja is a great platform to test this out on. Look forward to seeing you results at the end of the week.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
In essence, this system is swing trading. As done in swing trading where pending buy/sell order at particular price decided by moving averages (or other techniques) , in this system these orders are placed at predefined fixed price from open. It is very hard to have consistently wining trade if we arbitrarily decide on this distance from open(like 10pips, 20 pips and so on.) This is a special case of general swing trading and it would be very useful if some criteria other than placing stop-order at particular distance from Open can be used. I think this system performance can be improved if stop order are placed based on 50/100 MA or based on price action patterns like pin-bar, W, Ms or S/R , Pivot lines and so on. This is just my opinion but I may be wrong.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
took a long time

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Thank you Joe, I look forward to getting your results as able.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
How is the manual trading using this system working out?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Every trade I've taken except one has made profit. However, I found someone who is local to me who trades Forex, so I met with him for lunch the other day, and he showed me his trading record where he has had over 500 trades with no loss. He shared his system with me. Right now I am focusing my efforts on learning that system, and will no doubt return to this one over time.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
You may want to switch off your PM, I'm guessing you're about to get inundated .... This thread's great. Been checking it out for the past week, and the method looks solid. Well done.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Ah, good point. I cannot share anything about his system, as he sells it commercially. So I won't answer any questions about the system right now. Thank you for your kind comments.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Yeah-- let it out let all of us make 500 trades with zero loss too

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I'm sorry but I doubt there's system like this unless it has 5000pips stoploss or something..

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Well I think the question is what is the risk and what is the reward... the win rate is 100% but at what cost? If you have a decent risk reward then in the short term good job for finding such a strategy! May you be someone as giving as the person who shared it with you!! I hope the cost wasn't too high... Remember you give and you get thats the rule of nature forget capitalism. Jag

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I would like it too...even it would be just one pip but warranted

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I don't think I can post a link here, but you can google "Forex Renewal" and his website is the first one to come up. I met with him last week over lunch and verified his live trading record, and it is indeed accurate. What is amazing to me is that his balance is actually fairly small, even with winning all his trades, and the reason is because he does not compound at all. He has been using 1 mini lot to trade with since he began, and has not changed. He would have several million had he been compounding.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I found the forex renewal website. Here is something on the website ================================================ In the month of December 2010 I had 65 positive trades in a row without any losses. Even though I was 100% certain that each trade would produce at least 20 pips, I did not know how much time each trade would take. Most trades take less than 15 minutes, some trades take as long as 30 minutes, but there are a few trades that make you wait and wait. One such trade was a long entered on the GBP/USD. I was 100% certain that this was going to be a trade, based upon my system, that would produce 20 pips. I entered the trade and immediately set a stop. The stop was never hit but the trade was in the oven for ten days. ==================================================== What this tells me is that he has HUUUUUGE Stop losses Can you imagine being in a trade for 10 days and it not hitting either your 20 pip target or your stop loss This has to mean HUUUUGE stop losses Who is going to trade larger lot sizes with HUUUUGE stop losses Correct me if I am wrong PGPB

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Yes, you are indeed wrong. I asked him the very same question. Here is my question, followed by his answer below: &gt; Barry, &gt; &gt; As I got to thinking about your trading results I wanted to ask you a &gt; question before we meet together. Do you trade with no stop loss, or &gt; with a huge risk to reward ratio? The reason I am asking is because, &gt; just to be upfront with you, I really do not like trading this way. &gt; &gt; I connected up with a company awhile back that promised 100% &gt; profitable trades, and produced a long track record, over 200 trades, &gt; that were all profitable. Then I found out why. They traded with no &gt; stop loss and took only 5 pips profit on each trade. &gt; &gt; And while that indeed worked for them, at least for a few months or &gt; years, I was just not comfortable trading that way. &gt; &gt; So could you please let me know if you trade in a similar way? As I &gt; was thinking about it last night that seemed to make sense, as you &gt; stated you went 10 days one time while waiting for your 20 pip target to hit. &gt; &gt; Thank you very much. Mike Here is his response: I knew a guy like that to. He only took 3 pips on each trade with a 9 pips SL. I have a stop loss on every trade of 20 pips. My TP on every trade is 20 pips or more. I had a signal to go long on the G/U and the 20 pips target got hit only because the stop never got hit. My cell is .... if you can't make it. Barry

--- 帖子 #446 ---
To be completely upfront, I do believe my friend, Barry, "breathes with the market"; meaning his system is not 100 percent mechanical, and he will indeed increase his stops on volatile days. As an example, we were stopped out yesterday during NFP whereas he got 20 pips. He increased the size of his stop loss, and we did not. Let's not take up this thread with his method, however. I've given you the way to find him if you want, now let's keep this thread about the original method. I will be trading it some on Monday.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
First, this testing week was dismal since I kept losing connection to the order server. Comcast is part to blame and either Ninja or PFG is part to blame since I wasn't automatically connected back to the order server when the internet connection came back on. So, this is only 3 days of data, and only part days at that. These results are only of the COMPLETED trades. I didn't log the number of trades, just the results. Platform: Ninja Trader 6.5 Live Sim test on 6 Pairs using auto-strategy (FOREX folks use the term ROBOT) Strategy Enters on a Stop and Exits on a Limit Order at the first tick of a new bar, either end. In effect, Exiting at the Close of the 50 Range bar acts as built in Target and Stop Loss. *** NOT GOOD when internet goes out in the middle of a trade *** 50 Range Bars, 17 pip move from Open to place Stop Entry, 25 pip move from Open to Cancel Order if no Entry. Trade time varied due to internet outage, but typically 9 PM Eastern to 9 AM Eastern. These results are in $$ PnL since each pair has different dollar value per pip and include Spread and Commission ($0.50 per trade for mini lot). USD/CAD $52.08 GBP/JPY $142.42 EUR/USD -$10.00 USD/JPY $25.49 USD/CHF -$19.11 GBP/USD - $125.00 Net Profit $65.88 I'll work on the strat this weekend and see if I can figure a way to set the Stop Loss at the opposite end of a bar once a trade is initiated. So far, so good. I HOPE to get a better test week next week. Joe

Something smells fishy here. DL, I must say I suspect you try to sell something in the name of "other's" name which is also you! People, be careful!

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Wow, I guess if you get burned enough times you start to suspect everybody. No, I'm not selling a thing, certainly not "in the name of others." That would go against my belief system and integrity. I do, however, believe in my friend, Barry's system. I'm meeting with him again tomorrow for lunch and look forward to learning more from him. Isn't it amazing what Forex trading has degenerated to? Everybody is trying to sell something, so that even those of us who aren't are suspect. I understand, Smilee, you've just been burned and don't want anyone else to be.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Thank you Pecunix, I always believed this to be a profitable system, and you've verified it. It would be nice to trade this 24 hours a day and see if we get any different results as well.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Sorry, I don't "buy" it. By the way, I have never got burned and never will be burned from others' system.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
There are several others on here who have purchased from Barry and can vouch for the fact that he is indeed not me. I appreciate that you have a naturally suspicious character, and with Forex trading that can be a good thing. It's just not true in this case. Anybody can email him off of his website, and if you examine his manner of writing, will be able to see immediately that we are not the same. Anyway, enough discussion of this now, let's turn back to this system. Thanks to those of you have shown good results.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I hope you will apologize to DL when you discover you are wrong.....which you are.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I will defend Smilee ... Just try to understand ... FF is being recently flooded by scam ... at the end you don't know who can you trust ... :-/ But anyways, DL is a respectful member and I want to belive that he wouldn't risk his reputation ...

Hi guys, First time here.I found this thread looking for Constant Range Bar trading strategies ...I`m an advanced newbe(red it all,tried them all...).I trade mostly demo and sometimes a live cent-account.After trying like.. many systems... and strategies I come to some conclusions:forget about indicators( ok ema 200 maybe) and robots are a joke. I trade common sense PA,and channels(shi,LR ,fibo,EDC) with CRB.Unfortunately,or vice-versa ,sources treating Range Bars are very,very thin. I made some own experiments with different ranges,and I just come to that 33 pips bars are productive.This is an empiric observation, no statistics there. I was very happy to discover this thread. My "system" is simple.I look for daily bias: if long I trade only long and the other way around, when short.Enter 8 pips from open.L=5 TP=10.From midnight till midnight GMT there are15-25 bars.Average 20 bars,tradable under daytime 12, non-tradable 2,stoped 3-5. 50-70 pips profit.not very smart to be glued to the computer one should say,but I compare this work with a supervisor in the process industry and here you are!Range Bars are ideal, you don`t need to stress and speed the execution. I hope that I`m not the fat lady(I can`t sing),now when Dreamliner is leaving,but I really want to improve my use of CBR and find more effective strategies. I am using a "tool" that can be usefull in ANY Range Bars strategy.One green rectagle(h=The range) with the low base fixed to the fluctuating LOW. One orange rectangle(h=The range) with the upper base fixed to the fluctuating HIGH.I draw the rectangles with the instruments in MT4.Maybe such indicator exists but I did not find it.In my experince it is an exceptional VISUAL AID to control the" process". I `m aware of the fact that this thread IS NOT about indicators but this "tool" has not the attributes of a real indicator.I am not a programmer myself and my programming skills are poor to non-existent. I`m attaching an explanatory image and if one of you thinks it`s worth the time and effort maybe can he/she find a way to make an idicator out of it. Once again, it is a very usefull VISUAL AID.Thank you! webcom

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Thank you Trzcinek, I assure everyone, I am not selling one single thing. First of all, I really have not been profitable trading Forex, though I have tried to be for a long time. This system here, is the first I've been profitable with. Even so, I would not sell it to anyone, but only give it here on FF. I agree that there are numerous scams, and we are all cautious about it. I do appreciate my friend, Barry's system, and I have verified his results with my own eyes. I appreciate that he is a man of integrity and can recommend him to anyone. However, I do not get any "kickback", no "affiliate" agreement, no other remuneration in any way. I merely appreciate what he has discovered and commend his trading skills.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I purchased Barrys system and have been in communication with Barry. My feeling is that Dreamliner is not Barry. I have no doubts in my mind or heart regarding Dreamliners sincerity or integrity. Ed

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Thanks Ed, and anyone in the Ohio area is invited to come meet with Barry and I tomorrow at noon at Appleby's in Fairlawn. There will be 4 traders there.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I'll vouch for Deamliner. I've known him for a long time and he is the last person who would try to pull anything unethical.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
G'day Dreamliner Apparently Barry used to be a big poster on FF a while back. I searched FF under Barry Huddleston but no luck. I was wondering if you or anyone knows his forum name? Cheers

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Yes, I do know what it is, but I'm not sure if he wants it published or not. I searched all of his posts, and basically he just gives his profitable trades, one after the other. He was banned for a short time because he posted a URL to a blog, as he didn't know he wasn't supposed to do that. Many people have not believed his trading records, but I have seen them, touched them, verified them. Of course I will quickly add that this is a discretionary system and is a very experienced and knowledgeable trader. Our results (my wife, and son and I) were not as good as his last week as we got stopped out on a trade during NFP last Friday due to too tight a stop. He wasn't and was profitable on that day as well.

Zamanib was just lucky to get a winner period on Dec 1-8th; I have exactly the same winners during that period. Infortunately, on extended testing from Nov 1st to Dec 18th, the system had lost money, balance going from 10000 to 6000 on 1 lot, meaning -400 pips. The big flaws of this system are 1) missing big moves, 2) trading against the trend.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Greetings friends, Because of the success we are having trading Barry's Forex Renewal system I am now going to devote my time to it. I simply have seen a much better system and want to devote my time to trading it. We have also started a Yahoo discussion group for Barry's method, and if you PM me your order number with Barry's system I will invite you to the group. The group is here . I am now leaving this thread and don't expect to frequent it further, though you can obviously continue discussing it if you want. Thank you for those who have contributed.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
One other thing, in order to invite you to the discussion group, I need your email address sent to me in PM as well (obviously). Thank you. Your email will only be used for inviting you to the discussion group, nothing else.

are you testing it?

Of course and the F.I.B.O. technique looks great too, from the hand picked example, don't think every trade could be that good!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
looks interesting, im using range bar too. Btw, the fibo method is not there, it shows range bar only.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
yes, i believe that 25 and 50 range setting is the best for monitoring price movements. some times i use the 100 bar setting to get the big picture.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Yikes, did you see that they wanted $2500.00 for their full system? They are slick marketers, that much I know. Even the recorded voice on the "live" webinar was slick as could be. I don't trust marketers. I believe that if a system made consistently good pips people would put up their exact results of live trading for months. If people were required to do that it would shut down 99% of the forex "systems" being sold today. As most of you know I am now trading a completely discretionary system now that makes 1% per day, consistently. The wonderful thing about it is that it has over a year of history, the exact results posted for all to view. But the link below has no results; no backtesting or demo results, no nothing. Granted, they do give away indicators, but those are just bait. What they are really doing is fishing for you to bite on their $2500.00 system. STAY CLEAR!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
yes they try to make money by selling -- but they bring out some interested points-- on price movement -fluxation 1. Trend 2. Reversal. 3. Continuation 4. Breakout and yes you need a system for each one -- is one fail the other make-

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Yes, the do indeed give away some good information, I have learned a lot by them and received some good indicators for free. But with the selling already. It seems that we forex traders are just viewed as big wallets walking around as one pilferer after another reaches in and attempts to "sell us something that can't fail." Especially these guys, they are very slick marketers, way too slick in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
You got that right, Google for forexpeacearmy website if you are not already familiar with it, they are notching up a few complaints. As slick as they are, it has to be a scam, as you point out, no results, no demo, don't even show you a CHART on the webinar? What's up with that, isn't that what indicators and systems are all about? And for that price, they would have to show me an audited statement of transactions....

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Exactly right. They are very polished in their attempts to deceive. I can't stand companies like that and believe they should be immediately shut down by regulatory committees.

Hi Oluwadare, I don't publish the link to the system because I do not want to send people away from FF. I am merely using the trade journal to record the trades for my own accountability.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
HI Dreamliner, your system uses STOP orders, because you are buying higher than current price and selling lower than your current price.. Limit orders are those where you buy lower than your current price or sell higher than your current price.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Any chance to resurrect this topic?
