Attached Image Need4Speed is an intrad-day Scalping System. It measures Speed of the Price in Points over a user specified time interval in Seconds . Sounds can be activated to alert when Maximum Speed is exceeded. The system counts and plots the number of Bullish and/or Bearish impulses that exceeded max speed in each bar. Check Post 435 for a summary of terms used in this thread. Entry Options: Least Risky : Long when having more Bullish Impulses in a Bearish Bar (Hidden Buying) Short when having more Bearish Impulses in a Bullish Bar (Hidden Selling) Aggressive : Long on first Bullish Impulse Short on first Bearish Impulse Pending Orders ​​Buy Stop at High break of the bar with high number of Bullish and Bearish Impulses. ​​Sell Stop at Low break of the bar with high number of Bullish and Bearish Impulses. Supported Entry: Long when having more Bullish Impulses in a Bullish Bar (Exposed Buying) Short when having more Bearish Impulses in a Bearish Bar (Exposed Selling) Exit Options: Fixed SL/TP using Fixed R:R ratio SL at last low/high and TP by a trailing stop Trailing Stop Opposite Signal Lot Size: Fixed Variable and calculated based on a risk percentage and SL Pairs/Time Frames: I prefer low spread liquid pairs (EURUSD,USDJPY,GBPUSD...) Lower Time Frames (M1,M5,M15) Higher Time Frames as Entry Filters Sessions : London (7:00 to 16:00 GMT) Attached Image (click to enlarge) First version of this EA is attached for you to test.

How do we trade it?? Indicator based or do you have an EA running for you?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I've tried a ton of these "impulse" EAs, but all of them were unsuccessful on live accounts. I like the logic behind this and hope your efforts are rewarded with many green pips.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
sounds fascinating!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Looks like all you need is Scalp Delight right now.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Where is the attached indicator/ea?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
For all the curious about this, you can start watching the Stoch(14,3,3) on 5M charts. It's not the same, since the Stochastic was designed for Divergences, but it's also a Momentum indicator, so it measures speed . That being said, you just can start developing your own system. Kind regards, MarketFox.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Testing version of the EA is attached to the 1st post. It goes into Experts folder although it is currently works as an indicator only. I also changed the thread name to a more s&amp;#&amp;y name

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Sounds pretty damn cool Will check it and report back if anything noteworthy pops up but already pondering about some scenarios:nerd:

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi buddies, Scalping is not my speciality as you know ... so this is completely a new experience for me

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Usually the biggest downside to scalping is the stress involved and sheer screen time it demands. It can be extremely profitable if done right, but may cost you too much in terms of time, health, family, friends, etc. That is why not being greedy is so important. 50 - 100pips a day harvested consistently and regularly with reasonable risk and money management is the closest thing to a holy grail I am experiencing! The markets greatest strength and weapon against scalpers trying to grab small pips at a time is volatility and whipsaw . So why not just use that against it? Turn it into it's greatest weakness. Its achilles heels. On the flip side, the scalpers greatest weakness is greed (which also causes overtrading, overleveraging,etc). Why not use that against the market? Learn how to use fear instead! Mind you, this is probably the complete opposite mindset and philosophy needed for swing and longer term trend trading!!!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Max. Speed input varies with each pair. Spread can be used as a guide. Time input better be 5 seconds or less. The less the better. Smaller time frames are better M1, M5. I think some scalpers already know how to utilise such a tool.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
What direction you thinking of going with the EA if I may ask?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yes Rooi, A complete system traded through a Robot. With an option of manual trading although it will be difficult. This is a scalping system where speed is a major factor, a Quick IN &amp; OUT. Spread will also play a major part in system profitability. I think best is to use with ECN brokers. Big lot size, small TP and SL.Traded through London session. The system can not be back tested. I will start forward testing next week. Regards

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Sounds good Good weekend to you sir Rooi

--- 帖子 #17 ---
will put it into test next week thank for sharing buddy!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Would you tell us more about your experience CR. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #19 ---
140 Downloads in 8 hours, Good Speed . I hope we can see some input from you guys next week.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I've experimented with several bots that were based on impulse(large price movements in very short periods of time). Only a couple of them performed well on demo. Unfortunately, they failed when traded on live accounts. I believe the main problems stemmed from latency issues and slippage. Trade execution with these types of EAs has to be perfect, especially when the take profit is only a few pips. I would definitely like to try your EA with FXCM , since I've been pretty happy with their executions of late.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
hi, I like your idea. as a suggestion: - max speed - at first time when I looked I didn't understand what it means. I would call it öther way (e.g. speed threshold) - I would put in the corner the following: bullish speed = x bearish speed = y net speed = z (where z = x-y) have a nice weekend, Dragos

--- 帖子 #22 ---
subscribed

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks for your input Dragos, I agree on the naming, so I will change the Max speed to Speed Threshold. As for bullish and bearish speed I don't think they are important, only the net speed (Speed) is important, as we are scalping we don't need too many distractions. However I am thinking of adding a Max Bullish Threshold , and Max Bearish Threshold to hold max values reached in the session. Those max values can be used as a guidance in re-setting the Speed Threshold. I was thinking also of computing the Speed Threshold automatically instead of entering it as a parameter as it will change based on pair and time and news. As for TP I think its better to use a Trailing Stop instead of TP, OR maybe a pre-set R:R ratio . SL better be variable below or above recent swing high/low. Lot size to be calculated using SL and Risk Percentage. Regards,

Entry Options: Least Risky : Long when having more Bullish Impulses in a Bearish Bar (Hidden Buying) Short when having more Bearish Impulses in a Bullish Bar (Hidden Selling) Aggressive : Long on first Bullish Impulse Short on first Bearish Impulse

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hmmm...getting more interesting. And you say it wouldnt be possible to display an amount of history of this impulses for backtest purposes? What about realtime tracking and rcording for future use as history?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Backtesting is not possible because EA uses ticks and the lowest you can go for back testing is M1. As for recording history ... mmm.. I might consider at a later stage.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
abokwaik, Just a thought, but would timing range bar formation enable you to backtest your ideas? For example, in the image below, we have the ms it took to form a 4 pip bar (red bars), and then a running average (blue line). I have highlighted areas where there was a burst of speed (potentially large orders in the market). One strategy might be to look at what happens to when price returns to this areas.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I like that

--- 帖子 #29 ---
3 years ago I was working on a similar strategy and EA. If the price moved an 'n1' number of pips within 5 seconds or an 'n2' number of pips within 15 secs or an 'n3' number of pips within 30 secs or an 'n4' number of pips within 60 secs a trade would be opened with a tight trailing stop. The backtest results were amazing: PyraulusScalper - EURUSD 2ys LOW RISK PyraulusScalper - USDJPY 2ys LOW RISK PyraulusScalper 1.1.1 - EURUSD PyraulusScalper 1.1.1 - USDJPY PyraulusScalper 1.1.1 - GBPUSD I named the EA "PyraulusScalper" because the backtest curves look like trails of missile being fired up into the sky and "pyraulus" is the greek word for missile / rocket Unfortunately though, the EA was not profitable during forward tests due to high spreads and too much slippage / lagging during times of high volatility. However, my broker ( Pepperstone ) has improved a lot technologically since then, so maybe I should give it another try now under improved conditions.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Another method of entry can be by placing a stop orders on both sides of an "Interesting Bar". Interesting Bar is a bar with high number of big pushes on one or both sides.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Simply Fascinating

--- 帖子 #32 ---
An enhanced version with: Max Bullish, Max Bearish Display Font Size Control This (or the first version) are to be used to monitor the behavior of those impulses and their predictability power on near future path of price. a Full Robot to be released soon .... Fixed Version Uploaded

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi k4y can you share this EA? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Do you think that this EA, in a future stage, could be used for BO ? I was thinking that maybe the signal allows us to place turbo options (short expiry time, from 30s to 5 minutes) exploiting the acceleration in one direction and the consequent short term movement. Just an idea

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I've just re-uploaded the EA in post # 32. Sorry for any inconvenience.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Same minds, i had too.... I guess it can be a good solution for...will make some test next week

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Khalil, very interesting....and like the idea too... as scalping is the king class of trading :-)... Thank you very much for sharing with us! Have a good weekend and greetings to Jordan....

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Subscribed with interest. Will look forward your weekly result next week

--- 帖子 #43 ---
The concept is pretty easy.. Nevertheless the correct expiry time will be tricky to find! Let me know if I can do anything to help with the testing

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Let us see, how works next week, when market is open... to test it for binary options is easy. Have a look at images, i posted in another thread. We are developing since 1 year a binary option system and we have a Auto analyse tool, which analyse each signal from 1-480 MIN... If we can integrated a email alert, i put it in our anaylse and we see the results, that might be also interesting for FX, as we calculate also the pips after xxTime and as a backtesting is not possible, could be a good idea. Thank you for offering help.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
So just so I understand, you are trying to develop a system that triggers in the single digit seconds but you have not back tested this concept, so you are just theorising? Why don't you open a free demo Dukascopy account (I'm sure there are other brokers available) where you can back test using tick data. I suspect that if you do see some edge the next step is to run a GA on it to determine the best conditions to trigger a trade. Good luck.

Good morning Khalil, Good morning all, have a good start in your week. watching the N4S in morning... Where some bigger movements, speed was from 2-12, but no signal or bull or bears where showing...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Good morning Akvisto, Akvisto my man, I've seen your quality posts in Dashborad Trding and Volatility indicators threads and other places. So I'm gonna forgive you for this one. You're using a 4-digit broker. All inputs are in Points (pipettes) not PIPS, so you have to change the inputs (i.e. 2 PIPS instead of 20 Points... and so on). Although I don't think the EA will be effective for a 4-digit broker.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Although London Session hasn't started yet. I am gonna test drive on 3 pairs EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY First Order issued on USD/JPY (aggressive) using buttons Attached Image (click to enlarge)

:-)...sorry the screenshot was cut wrong, no i am using 5 digi Broker, 5.th digit was not visible... Just have at 2 brokers and different results... which broker are you using? Might be a good idea, to check that... i have also an Lmax account, as far i know, one of the fastest broker.

Excellent. Could you explain exactly how you take the trade ?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks. Pls Check the 1st post. This is still experimental. :nerd:

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Yes got it thanks Khalil, If you are able to add an email alert, when a certains levels are reached, Speed/Bulls/bears and the functions to choose levels.... i can add it in our Auto Analyse System and we can run it 24/5 and we´ll see the results, in matter of time / TF/Pips. Would be my proposal and idea... If it sound interesting for you please PM me, to specify the alert.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
So you are waiting for the end of the bar to take the trade or during the bar ? And why the speed is important ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Speed is the number of points (bullish or bearish) the price moved in seconds (depending on your settings). The faster the speed the more money coming into the market. Our aim is to join that big money. To go aggressive we can open the trade on the current bar. Or we can wait until the bar close and evaluate the Bull/Bear power in terms of the number Big Bushes on the previous bar. Check the below chart of usd/jpy M5 No big bears at all. Only big bulls. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Check this GPB/USD M5. current bar big bears (8 bear big bushes vs 0 bull) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I am still having the swing trader mentality. GBP/USD went into profit &gt; 10 pips I and I got greedy and didn't close, and it reversed on me. Still learning the Scalping Mentality ...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
London Session: I will try the following thresholds GBP/USD 20 points/1 second EUR/USD 15 points/1 second USD/JPY 10 points/1 second

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Many thx...it's clear now

--- 帖子 #65 ---
From your nickname I think you are a scalper. If yes I would like to know your view on the system to be considered when developing the scalping robot for it. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I believe that this indicator should be used in conjunction with higher highs + higher lows for Long, and with lower highs+lower highs for Short. The latter will give the trend, and the indicator will give the entry points on the pullbacks. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
OK I 'm testing your system it's possible to use it as a powerful tool

--- 帖子 #68 ---
GBP/USD starting from London Session (Threshold 20/1) gave a perfect long signal (took part of it), I should have delayed my exit until the upper circle. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi there, Just to say, your system looks extremely interesting to me and I am running your EA on a chart next to my usual chart set-up. Thank you very much for sharing it. I will watch it closely and report back here how it goes. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
hello guys, started testing myself, so far looks that it's working just fine

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Few accidents on my first drive, although traffic signals were clear but I am just a bad driver. I will give it another shot before switching to autopilot mode.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I missed this one (was out). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
So much for manual drive. Switching to Autopilot.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
play it safe on safe trade signals, traded on arrow, just for test .... 19 cents profit )

--- 帖子 #75 ---
:-) Scalping is a hard business ;-)... needs to be very attend all time... Thank you for sharing

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Autopilot is doing good so far. 3 trades first was a winner 10 pips on GBPUSD. Other 2 are still running. I will leave it running and go out for some business. PS: This version of autopilot is aggressive, it will take the first signal, and exit on either profit or loss.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
trading manualy, 3 safe signals, 3 profit closed transactions - 1 h testing time ...... keep you informed ....

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hey abokkwaik I am mostly silent, but your work here caught my attention. Its pretty much exactly something that i have been planning to do myself. I tried it out real quick on 1min time frame with really right SL and TP with promising results, one thing that i miss tho is an adjustable spread protection, for example, no trades should be sent if the spread is above X pips (where "X" is the adjustable amount of pips/points).

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I got three out of three 10 point winners on 1m DAX chart using the safe entries. Stopped now until US Open as 11 to 1430 London time not good for scalping. Will continue to watch those safe entry set-ups throughout the afternoon too, 1430 to 1700.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi, I'm not sure it can be a winning strategy on long term but I'm curious and I will testi it on my side.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Pontus, I'm trying it on m1 eurusd too. What are you using for treshold?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
An impulse at resistance level turns out a loser trade...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Great.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
We are still in the testing phase. Its a learning process. It might do well, or it might not.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
This is the 1st day, and I am sure many lessons will be learnt. Your note regarding the spread is taken. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
So far, 9 trades were taken by Autopilot (Aggressive Signals), 5 winners and 4 losers. With 1:1 RR. I am going to increase R:R to 1:1.5 and see.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi, Threw it on both EU 1M and EU MeanRenko 5p charts Not sure the 100 points TP suits me so I'll play with it a bit. Can we get a trailing stop? And a way to change the comment, please? Thank you for all your hard work. [EDIT] OK, 4 trades ended in profit but for the life of me I can't say if they were triggered on the Renko or the regular chart. Also, I get the number of impulses printed on the chart way way later then they should have been printed, I think. Can you explain again what the Bullish/Bearish fields mean, please? I'm running it automated but woul like to know how to work with it manually, as well. Thanks!

Your entry in H1 chart, typical counter trade. Not too much risky? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Jibala

--- 帖子 #89 ---
working on M5 chart, euro/usd, 6 safe signals till now, 5 correct, 1 false, 3 trades made with profit, 0 loss. 80% correct is something big, 50% profit is more than perfect. as i can see it is not ok to trade during big time volatility and we still have to look at indicators. overall i like the robot, will see how it performs from now on. i have to say i work only on live account .....

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Good Job SN When you say "safe signal" are you referring to the Least Risky : Long when having more Bullish Impulses in a Bearish Bar (Hidden Buying) Short when having more Bearish Impulses in a Bullish Bar (Hidden Selling) On Post #1 or something else, Kindly Explain

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Jibala, Great work on Dashboards I must say. Currently I am not applying any filter and I just want to see how the Basic idea performs ... and does it really read the Market Heart Beat or not. I already have many ideas to implement ... just hold on ... and enjoy the RIDE Thanks for dropping by, Khalil

--- 帖子 #92 ---
YES. What do you mean ??

--- 帖子 #93 ---
yes lad, safe signal = least risky i got a big problem, moved the indicator in other corner, but i can't manage to move the buy sell buttons from that upper right corner and that is bad for me, please and advice on how to move them

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Fantastic tool, very helpful to sense the state of the market at the moment. I don't care for the EA part, but already it's helped me with a few scalping trades.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks, Buttons are not movable at the moment, I will do it in next version.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I noticed that after leaving the robot working for a while "Bull" and "Bear" max speed are not updating , or even re-set to zero... I will look into this and fix it in next version. Also if you change the time frame all objects are removed and only robot new objects are redrawn. So if you have drawn any lines ... etc. it will vanish. In next version I will only remove the old robot objects and keep other stuff on the chart.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Note also that reverse signals are not taken while in a trade ... something to think about

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks! Well, it has this N4S03A comment and since it's on different charts (Renko and regular) I woul like to be able to change it so it can be traced without searching the magic number.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
OK I will make it user defined.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Robot generates many "off quote" errors, so this also should be handled in next version. Quite a busy day .. ha

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks for ea...I have a idea is it be useful or not I dont know only want speak loud voice daily pips... if ea take profit everyday will stop and will work next day,I think low pips will be sufficient. less risk and more profitable...Regards natla.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I think Equity Percentage as Daily Profit Target/Loss could be better than pips.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
this is much better...Regards natla

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I am gonna leave for now, and let the robot running to see how it performs in late American and Asian sessions. Much analysis to be done ..

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Having a look through the trades in your TE under list...overall, I'd say that they don't look terrible. Looking at the charts and positions, this seemingly is a damn decent way to trigger, but I would think that you may want to qualify the trades a little better. As a single source, it does find times when there is volume and movement, it's just typically more so on the wrong side of things, thus the equity curve. I've compared a few of the trades over a couple of the time frames as available, and even though I can only kind of get a handle on it...would seem that if they were qualified through an M5 OBOS oscillator, you'd probably up the win:loss ratio. Very kewl idea, dude.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hey Magix, nice to see you here m8 I have a test going on with this beast on 28 pairs. And my conclusion so far is that this type of trigger in line with some spread and trend (and/or S&amp;R) filtering is going to be a killer!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Volume precedes price. Volume is both present at the beginning of a trend and at the end. What the current idea lacks is a way to distinguish between the 2 and there in lies the problem. Take this triggering and apply it to almost any system and you can only improve it, IMO. I have a few too many testers on the go at current, so am not actually lending to the testing on this one, but will be interested to see how it develops, or if I can, hopefully throw a little to logic.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hello, best EA i tested!, i use it with very aggressive trademanager (trailing SL+TP channel) and all trades are winning, but losing trades eat all profit, but still in bit profit. Waiting for new version not deleting objects of others indicators. (Tip: for intraday hedging is better then SL?). I ran it from 18:00 PM of 1st day, i don't like manual trading.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Not liking manual trading, shouldn't restrict you from adding a little to your success with this idea. If you can take your idea of what you deem long trends and short trends, by either daily or session, you can restrict the EA to only trade in what you feel to be the direction of the trend using the "Only Long" or "Only Short" options in the Common tab when you set the EA to run. Any tool can only be as good as the person who holds it.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
aggain: Sorry for my english, my idea is is keep difference between SL and TP constant. Its simple EA. Currently dont work, Its very dependent who can hedge and who don't???. I want trade my own manager, but its.... nobody inwented to trail profit....., key is trail PROFIT!!!!!??????????

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Its poor to post my trade to manager. I post my source is only if trade managerer... Hard to entry. Bye....

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I am not arguing with you...in fact, I do agree, 100%. Have a look at this account HERE . This is an EA I wrote and is being tested by a friend. What you should look at is: Win % difference. Net Gains - closed trades. And after you've gone through that, have a look at the "History", under trading activity. What you should gain from this, is that the vast majority of trades that closed, closed at a "Stop Loss", but were all in profit. What this means, is that they closed under a "Trail Stop". Just because it isn't there, doesn't mean that you cannot run with the idea, by either manual exits and trailstops, or other utilities that allow you to trail your profit.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Yes, one loss WIPE many wins and its problem, its reason why I understand many questions. Answer is wait fot NEW version, or win better winning ALGORITHM, first thing is use "HEDGE of instead opposite order (needed for daytradding)". In day trading is SL tottaly failed (its must be highlightet). Heh I still looking for good trade managing. My trade manager is not secret and is available for everyone. Thread purpose is for tickscalper, "WHERE I FAILED and my tick scalper is available for everyone"!!!

hello Khalil I trying your EA... you doning work well done ...bro i have one Idea why you not Creat EA for TRIANGULAR ARBITRAGE . simply calculate cross pair's value find opportunity and place order then take profit and close all trade... this is risk free straight ... I have forumla for this cross pairs calculation...Please think about TRIANGULAR ARBITRAGE bro you are a special person .you hace quality to built risk free EA... And FOR N4S you must add multiples order's...because first buy order is open in EURUSD at 1.08000 then N4S suggest to sell EURUSD then must second possition open in EURUSD...because this is a scalping EA thanks ... And sorry for my bad English

Thanks Magix for your input , Glad to have you here. I agree with what you said. I just wanted to start with "raw" entry/exit to test the idea in a native fashion. If we skip the initial manual trades, I think its promising. I am analyzing the performance and will see what best fits this EA. Oscillator you mentioned is one of the options for sure .

Hi Ahmed, For new robot ideas, you are welcome to post in " Robot Lab Project " thread here on FF. For hedging, I don't think its a good idea. As for opposite signals while in a trade , I am studying this and might add an option for exit and reverse if the opposite signal is stronger than the previous signal. Remember So Far, I have used ONLY one Entry and one Exit option from the ones stated on the 1st post. Safe Driving

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Results for a 8h (6h before to 2h after Tokyo Open) N4S_03_auto trading with 27 pairs. Loss abot 5%.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Loss is expected using the conditions in post # 120. I'd be surprised if it won .

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Stage 1 Completed: Does the idea make sense? I think it does. Does it need further enhancements to become a winner? Of course it does.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I'm not surprised too. I think it's not a bad result for over 200 trades, all pairs and only default settings.

Did any one have a chance to try Pending Stop Orders (3 rd option for entry) 3- Pending Orders ​​Buy Stop at High break of the bar with high number of Bullish and Bearish Impulses. ​​Sell Stop at Low break of the bar with high number of Bullish and Bearish Impulses. I am keen to know if it makes sense, in order to incorporate or not in coming version.

Hi abokwaik, Something occured to me which I thought I could share. It is slightly out of the box, and I haven't seen it on the thread yet. It might be interesting to test robots in the contrarian mode, i. e. if the signal is to sell, it should buy etc. I don't mean it as a joke (I really think you are doing an excellent job), I think this way of testing could be quite useful if you happen to have a spare demo account and a processor. You have several possibilities which imo lead to following conclusions: 1. The original is better than the contrarian, and it wins while the contrarian loses =&gt; idea is good and sound. 2. The original is better than the contrarian, but still loses =&gt; Idea is good, but the spread is killing it. Probably some filtering needed. 3. The contrarian is better than the original, but still loses =&gt; Idea is wrong, but insufficiently wrong. The spread still kills it. 4. The contrarian wins while the original loses =&gt; The idea is incorrect, and one needs to readjust the original thinking. But apart from the hurt ego, you do have a winner. Cheers, k

Nice EA, just taken GU sell on 1 min and the price went all the way to 10 pips postive, my way to manage the trade is to closed 80% at 10 pip and breakeven,but my existing trade managment EA does not recognize the magic number, it only recognize 0 as a magic number, is it possibple for you to remove the comment and leave it blank, i guess coz of the the EA comment my trade manager cant close it at 10 pips

Hi all. I was trying to do similar robot with speed as confirmation but based on ticks rather then time, and with that Strength indicator as main direction and what currency pair to trade. Although it is maybe to early for this project to think about that for implementation I believe that it would be good direction for this project to move on. Green pips

Hi Abokwaik, does the Auto EA only trade one position or does it open another trade while you still have existing position?

Consecutive wins after changing TP to 40 points is amazing, maybe this is what scalping is about.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I have a test going on 28 pairs with 5pip tp and sl, I'll get back to you with stats when I'm at my computer (posting from my phone).

--- 帖子 #157 ---
yes, i have him too with SL 20 points and TP now at 200 points and now is in profit... have him at TF1

--- 帖子 #158 ---
It seems that there is a probability distribution over two possibilities that can happen after an impulse: continuation and reverse. I am running the EA on 5 low spread pairs (SL/TP=100 points), so far breakeven. I'm recording the trades, signals, a moving average value, and a few other quantities to analyze later when I have 300-400 trades. This way, we may be able to improve the strategy.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
You're doing good job! Thanks for sharing it with us!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Alright, some stats. TF: 1 min SL: 20 points TP: 20 points 28 different pairs tested. A total of about 1000 trades taken during the past 24 hours. On pairs with higher spreads this was a disaster, more or less. 90%-100% losers. Some trades where closed immediately due to the fact that the spread was above 20 points at the time when the trades was taken. (GPBCHF was one of them, those pairs where removed from the test when discovered) This was not a surprise, but it proves the point that a spread filter would be a good idea. There will be times (news events for example) when the spreads widen even on high liquidity pairs such as EURUSD. EURUSD was the best performer and gave me 53% winning trades. Another thing i noticed is that many trades went straight into profit, just to turn around and close at a loss. I beleive that a really tight trailing stop loss could improve the winning rate. I have set up a few new tests with different settings and one where i have attached a trade manager that immediately trails the stop loss. Lets see what this gives us Oh, and keep up the good work abokwaik, this is really exciting stuff!

Intermediate result after 4 h: The "contras" are in front (63 % winrate, 50 % the normal version)

You're results are consistent with mine! Could you report how many trades generated your results?

By now 55 - 60 trades both.

Thank yoy Traffex, you're doing a wonderful job. Please post your settings for both.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Good day. I am new here. I would simply like to know abokwaik why hasnt your system worked out during trading demo

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I think the results would be better at London open and NY open....no 24/24 Two reasons : better volatility and small spread

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Thats how some of the best scalpers I know do it. This should do better than 3 years ago with all the volatility presently in the markets.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes, you are correct. If i take the EURUSD and look at the first hour from London i get 67% wins, the first hour from NY open gives me 80% win. If I look at the first 3 hours from open that gives me 42% win on london and 62% win on NY.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Good Day English, I can summarize few reasons here ... 1. Robot was running in aggressive mode (taking the first signal - no filtration), High leverage , for a worst case scenario. 2. Money Management is not built in. 3. Risk Management is not built in. 4. System still in development phase. Or maybe it was a bad idea after all. I am out of here.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hé hé maybe a time filter in the next version ?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thank you very much for your reply. I for one love to see new systems, only because it allows one to learn. Keep up the good work my friend.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Many thx abokwaik....you're a great coder Could you set the mode ...aggressive or no in the next version ?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi everyone, first need to thank Abukwaik for his great job, all other guys for the improvements and the notes they added to make it better. I will start to use the EA from now, but I will use the Camarilla daily/hourly lines as exit levels, I usually use them when I am scalping in my regular trading days. I will try also to add some filters on each pair to give it more efficient. Keep you updated

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi madscalp, Trading Hours and Entry Options (Mode) , along with other features will be included in next version as mentioned in Post # 138 I am waiting for more input before next version, lets give the bot a chance to allow for further analysis ... I am not in a rush ... are you ... ? Oh I forgot we are in Neeed4Speeed not in the lab ..

Just for Information (As some people might check the TE). Latest closed trades were entered by the robot and closed by me manually (partial profit, trailing, BE ... etc). Current trades and coming trades tonight will be completely managed by the robot. I raised the Threshold for 3 pairs in order to only take SERIOUS moves. I also increased TP to 200 and SL to 150. I am at home now and the robot is by itself (himself) ... whatever

Any stats on best Threshold values for different pairs in different sessions ...? I am currently using 15/1 for UJ, 20 or 25/1 for EU and GU

It is crazy to trade forex at 1 minute timeframe. There nothing except the noise. Guys, don t you think that the idea to trade the 1 minute timeframe is initially a failure? All the higher timeframes by one and at the same time) will crush you when you go against them at 1 minute timeframe. Ps: Be smart and watch the market. Ps2: To be honest this thread made me laugh, look how many pips I make... and you're talking about trading the 1 minute timeframe.

OK, let me be clear enough. If you have nothing to add to this thread than few stupid words, then ok, we got you and we will try to be smart just like you. Keep learning attitude is the most important thing we all get when we participate in threads like this, and sharing all the experience between each other is the real fortune, unfortunately, people like you will never know the value of this. Take you show off words and images look for some gold diggers to impress. PS: scalpers are the best traders when it comes to kick some ^#*S.

very intresting looking to hear more from the thread on how everybody does with this system

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I agree that scalping is cool and can be very VERY profitable, but it is not an option for me to trade forex at 1 minute timeframe - that is my main message. Stocks and indexes - yes, Forex - no. Movements in stocks and indexes are more smooth and clear and forex is much more noisy... by it self.

Hey Hops, Nice looking Equity curve! A very short time in market and trading with "Robofx" for a few hundred bucks...all good, my friend. Thing is...for a lot of us, we do trade manually and use these ideas to both improve on our own current manual logic as well as have hobby accounts. The automated strategies for a lot are a dream or a nightmare, depending on what side of the trades you land. But, make no mistake, with every loss, there is an improvement. With every trade, comes understanding. You may not be able to view optics on an M1 chart, but a lot of others can and even more so want to. I believe your ideas would actually be an asset to any trade logic and think it'd be a lot more beneficial for you to either throw in your 2 cents on adaptation, or find a little corner of your own to share in. In all sincerity, I get that you have a lot to say...and getting past the fact that you've only earned a couple hundred with a dogshit broker, there is a tale to your tape. Lend a little, others will be a lot more open to your ideas than to your mockery.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Adding my favorite filters to the chart gives me the results I need , these levels will help me to get out from the trade in the right time and place, and it will safenest my trades also by avoiding critical levels / daily or weekly or even hourly ,as I will use this system to trade BIG lots with tight PIPS . I will keep the testing mood for the end of this week and maybe edit those levels to become better. Need to go , IT'S PRAY FAJER TIME.

Hello Guyz.. And specialy thanks to KHalil Doing great job well done....N4S-03-contra works good on normal market...I am show you the result ..I suggest use N4S-03 USe in NEW'S time and N4s_03_Contra use in normal market... Superbbbbbbbbbbb work Khalil bro MASHALLAH.....

default settings for contra..?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Ahmed, it will be great if you send me the setting you are using for both N4S -03 and Contra. The results on cable are amazing just like always&lt; you need to try it with gold (it gave me good results), Actually I am trying to see what are the best pairs to trade, the best time , the best setting. thank you in advance Salam Alikom

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Mouth watering Congrats, will test it.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Can you share the set files you are using for both versions of the EA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Walikum as sallam Use only Major pairs...like EURUSD, GBPUSD , USDJPY ,USDCAD etc. with ECN broker. for N4S_03_Contra SL - 50 TP-30 to 70 Speed threshold for EU and GU 25/1 for UJ 20/1 Use this Indicator for scalping II_supDem For N4s_03 In News time you must use very short stop and long TP ..and speed threshold use 15/1 for All pairs ... you check this magic on Big news time...Because If market go's up then possitions and with short stop and filled your Tp... For Example EURusd befor News 1.0800 SL : 40 TP : 150 Then market go up 17pips filled your Tp if market goes down then also fill your Tp this is a Good trick .. I think you must try Today on FOMC with 14 pairs.. After the News show result... THanks MR.Khalil

Thanks. I guess for this set of parameters neither behaves spectacularly, but the contrarian seems slightly better. It is possible that for some other parameter set (or just some filtering, like trading only during news events) one or the other behaves significantly better.

Hey abokwaik, Just for your information, I started a new test a few moments ago, OOTB settings and I got a few of these errors, I dont know if i did anything different from earlier tests but perhaps you want to have a look at the code just in case there is something wrong 2015.04.29 10:13:29.696 array out of range in 'N4S_03_Auto.mq4' (67,11)

--- 帖子 #218 ---
First of all I want to thank you for sharing such a great tool. May I suggest to make the Long entries on down tick, and short entries on an uptick? This way the slippage could be minimized.. Thanks once again..

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Great. As for M1 . Time frames are of no real use for the robot. The Robot measures the speed (points/seconds) and when exceeds the threshold it plots the count on the bar high/low for bearish/bullish impulses respectively. I wouldn't go for over 5 seconds for Timing, default is 1 second. The idea here was to join the big money asap.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
At the moment I do not care much about the robot performance in terms of gain/loss. What important to me are the count,location and sequence of impulses. What I am trying to do here is to remove the noise made by small hands (retails traders) and focus on moves made by the BIG hands (Institutional Traders). I think and hope that this information can be used to create a clearer picture of Price Action. I am still digesting this information and will use all my analysis and coding skills to make something out of it.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
abokwaik - are you with a US broker? If not, you should not have any problems with FIFO restrictions.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
The numbers shown below/above the bars need some refinement, as they are not showing what was the threshold of the move, so a a move of 15 points will print as a move of 30 points, which is not fair. I am thinking of implement a multi/level color scheme of at least 3 levels in order to distinguish small/medium/big moves. Open to suggestions

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Maybe you could do this with a histogram in a separate window? It would be a nice visual too.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi abokwaik, Have you looked at my Tick Chart Creator EA ? It may be of your interest.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
It doesn't look at TF when calculating the speed (Money Injections or Impulses). But Signals can be taken off any time frame, even H4 if you like, based on the count of Bullish/Bearish Impulses on that bar.

Excellent - what settings, if I may ask?

Hello every one .. As i said in last post ... you must set short stop and long time at news time .. i will show you the result And one suggestion if you Guyz and Khalil agree... IN this EA you must add Feed fast like Lmax to slow broker then this EA works Risk free. after attach the feed ...long stop 2pips Tp alway filled..because Lmax is a direct Liquidity provider and price move is very fast compare to normal broker's...

Some explanations about the inputs: Lot Size &amp; Risk : If you want to use Fixed Lot Size set "Lot Size" to a valid lot size for your broker. If you want to enable variable lot size calculation based on Equity and Risk Percentage then set "Lot Size" to 0 and enable the "Risk Percentage" 0.02 = 2% ENTRY EXIT OPTIONS : - Aggressive : Open on first signal - Least Risky : Open on Bar Close : If Bulls &gt; Bears and Bar is Bearish Go Long and visa versa - Supported : Open on Bar Close : If Bulls &gt; Bears and Bar is Bullish Go Long and visa versa - Close on Opposite Signal : Close on Opposite Signal Based on Above Options

I switched for M5 time frame for faster action and testing of the EA. As I mentioned earlier BE, Trailing Stop and Trailing Jump are working perfectly.

Hi Khalil, EA looks really interesting. I intend on dowloading it shortly. I'm not that privy with testing EA's properly, but am following with interest. If I discover something useful I will certainly report back and contribute. I note there are a some pretty skillful coders also following you so I'm sure they will be of more use

Hi Khalil, you are a real generous and good minded person, you have all my respect! Thank you for being like this... I do the same in a different way... We need more humans like you! Glad to meet you! and happy to met so much good people here. JO

I put a demo up in 8 pairs including gold and silver with 2 lots ...forward test for few days.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hello Khalil. In your new version any changes in speed reading or just trade manager updated.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Good evening everyone, Better performance for the EA after I made more edits with more effort, changing s/l and t/p for each pair brought better results, especially after the free lesson from FOMC yesterday. By tomorrow I will post the results.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
No changes on Speed reading yet imifx.

I left the robot 3 hours ago on M5 charts of EURUSD with both LR and Supported entry options, 200 SL 100PP 1000TP 50TS and will run till end of week. So its gonna be a complete mess. I don't care about the results atm as much as I care about analysing those results.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
why not to add as well 'close an opposite signal'....sometimes market change so EA could adapt...only my thought

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Thanks a lot Fxentropy.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks for reminding me. I also set close on opposite to true.I told you its gonna be a complete mess.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
for the last 2 hours i ran the new version on aggressive mood , on more than six pairs 1m chart plus gold , it just traded gold!! and it was a mess learning more i will try LR now

--- 帖子 #285 ---
same here...losing big time... need to be tweaked..on settings..

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Unfortunately I tried all versions with different settings and the results are poor. I don't know how tu use this tool...maybe a good filter

There are two filters only, strength and correlation. Both in combination will give the magic power to grant a high winning rate. Jibala

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Interesting. So could you explain clearly your own strategy ?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I didn't write anything about a strategy just two filters!

We have to avoid automatic trading and use this solution...many thx

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Guys I dnt think the red or green is important, we are testing a logic which will work in our manual trading later.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
100%, this what we are doing exactly, I am running this system on 4 different platforms and i try to vary the settings and products all the time. For sure there is something there and in all cases, we are all the winners, why?? Because there are a lot of tools now on mt4 and other trading technologies will allow us to end UP in profit even if the test results are -20%!!, just please don't give final judgements, try to test, improve and develop, and you need to read all the feedback notes from all the others because you can always find something there. ENJOY THE TESTING. Many thanks to KHALIL and all the great guys here

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Nice result. Yes I agree with manual test, I also use currency strength, it is too many of them. Which one do you use?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Good question 007 !! With a fast and accurate strength meter we would have a huge advantage. But most of them are way to slow and mostly not very useful in the smaller TFs. Just found a new one which is based on the "cpm extended" strength meter and the calculation is depending on the selected TF the indi is launched at. (so the M1 and M5 should be included) Sounds not to bad to me. Check it out by clicking the "market" tab in your terminal and then "applications" and then type in the searchfield : currency power meter. (currency power meter linear, 15 bucks, is the one) And click on "view product on site" too for better visualation. Did not buy it jet (no I am not affiliate to the seller ) but maybe this thing could support the "need 4 speed" project very well. In fact with a realy good strength meter in the toolbox, trading the strongest against the weakest currency should make some money, don`t you think ??

Hi Guys, I would like to thank you for your comments and suggestions. It would be great if we have a look at the trades taken by the EA and try to analyze them. Believe me , you can learn from a loss more than you can learn from a win. If I am not mistaken MathTrader volunteered to do some analysis ... where are you man ? I will do my part of analysis , already have some ideas looking at yesterday's results (specially news time). I am off today so I can not contribute much, but I would like to mention that we are still on 1st gear , we still have 3 to 6 gears to test. Regards, Khalil PS: 120 Downloads of MQL version !!!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
today got some good results trading manually for the next week, im gonna do a test as following: i will trade 2 automated versions of N4S , in same chart (eurusd) one N4S04 and one N4S03 contra.....what you guys think? cheers and have a good weekend all!

--- 帖子 #299 ---
1. You need ECN/ STP broker to trade this system. 2. Aggressive mood to give you a better results you need to edit the t/p to make it 4 or 5 if you are using a 5 digits broker and don't use the partial close option, but the R/R ratio will be 4:1 which is bad, the loss will be bigger when it happens, BUT, the chance of the loss is 1 to 10. 3. eur, gbp, eurgbp , eurjpy, cad will give you good results 4. The main issue I face here is the bad entry for the EA, what i mean by bad is that it reacts to the breakout price move in a wrong way, which give me the higher price if breaking up or lower price if breaking down. i will attach an example for that case. Maybe you can help me with this 4. The trade history I have attached is for the last 28 trades (the big loss with -125 was before the new setting). 5. I will focus on supported entry next week. 6. Even It is very hard to test this kind of systems, but I have enjoyed my week testing this, and It worth it actually , because I learned alot. Thank you KHalil and all the other guys for wonderful job here. Have a nice weekend

Some findings after one week: Issue 1: Impulses Count is meaningless if we do not consider the Power of individual impulses. Example : Assuming a threshold of 15 pps on an Up Bar showing 3 Bullish Impulses and 1 Bearish Impulse will indicate a Long Signal (using Supported option), however when we know that the 3 Bullish impulses were of 18, 17, 16 power, while the Bearish impulse were of 77 power, we discover that the signal should be Short instead of Long. Suggested Solution : The above Bar in the example should show (18+17+16 = 51)/15 = 3.4 =&gt; 3 Bullish Impulses , and 77/15=5.13 =&gt; 5 Bearish Impulses. ================================================= Issue 2 : Current Bar/Current Time frame is traded in isolation of Higher Time Frames which can give misleading signals, specially in pullbacks. Suggested Solution : Maintain and show Impulses Count for higher time frames (i.e. H4, H1, M30). ================================================= Issue 3 : Taking all signals lead to huge number of trades which increases the effect of spread/commission/slippage. Suggested Solution: Signal Filtration either using the system itself (Higher Time Frame Impulses from Issue 2) or using out of system filters (i.e. Higher time frame candle direction, or a strength meter as suggested by Jibala). Also increasing the Speed Threshold would decrease the number of signals. Yesterday For example EUR/USD registered a Max Bulls Speed of 121 and a a Max Bears Speed of 165 While GBP/USD registered a Max Bulls Speed of 76 and a a Max Bears Speed of 126 So I think using a threshold of 20 or 30 pps will decrease the false signals. ================================================= Issue 4: Using Fixed SL, TP, BE, Partial Profit affects the system profitability. Suggested Solution: Variable SL : Low/High of Signal Bar. Variable TP : Opposite Signal (or a wider Trailing Stop, or a fixed R:R ratio). No BE and No Partial Profit. ================================================= Issue 5: Hedging, Aggressive Mode and multiple Orders per pair are killing the system. Suggested Solution: Disable all these options. ================================================= Edit : Corrected some numbers

Hi abokwaik, I collected about 250 trades from EURUSD, USDCAD, AUDUSD and USDJPY so far. I haven't started statistically analyzing the results yet. But I'll do it whenever I have a collection of 400 trades or more.

This is an Indicator version for the system. Its an Expert acting as an indicator, so copy under Experts Folder. This version can be used for manual trading in addition to your trading tools. It will show number of bullish and bearish impulses for current time frame plus 3 additional user defined higher time frames. It will also show the number of impulses above and below bars. Impulse count calculation as per suggested solution for issue 1 in post # 300 . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Well, this sucks. My VPS got screwed up during an OS update yesterday, so all the test i had running is lost and i cannot give you any data, sorry about that. I did notice that the aggressive entry doesn't seem to give any edge at all while the supported and least risky entry does. Will set up new test and let them run for a few days.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I am sorry for the VPS issue Pontus. I agree on Aggressive Option. As I mentioned in Post # 300 Issue 5: Hedging, Aggressive Mode and multiple Orders per pair are killing the system. Suggested Solution: Disable all these options. I am working on this week version of the EA, and I will try to apply all "suggested solutions" as per post # 300.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
abokwaik Thank you for your efforts on this interesting EA - subscribed. Have done some testing and it appears that running this bot 24/5 may not be a good idea. The results I am getting are telling me that I should probably avoid the Asian session as the results have not been great. Would it be possible to have a function where we could select the time of day we want to trade, as I believe that we would have much better results. Just my opinion ?? Thanks PipBear

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks PipBear, Yes. I agree. Trading hours was on my list ( Post 138 ) Version 5 is coming out of the oven ... sorry Out of the Garage.:nerd:

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Version 5 Attached Image (click to enlarge) The upper Time Frame Labels are for Bar (Candle) Direction, While The lower Time Frame Labels are for the Impulses. Trading Filters: - Use HTF Impulses : All Impulse Time Frames must agree for a signal + + Impulses on chart time frame closed bar. - Use HTF Bar Direction : All Higher Time Frames Directions must agree for a signal + Impulses on chart time frame closed bar.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
abokwaik Thank you very much for the quick response. Will give this one a try and report PipBear

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thanks for all your work on this Khalid, you are an inspiring person with your effort and generosity of sharing. I am continuing to monitor what I can achieve with this trading DAX manually on a 1m TF. I just loaded up the new indicator version so I can monitor the higher TFs alongside the 1m and will report back how that goes. For your information, last week taking the safer entries (eg where the Bull ticks exceed the Bear ticks in a Bear candle) it was profitable when using a TP of +10 points and a SL of the same, moving SL in stages as trade progresses. I am hopeful that using the higher TFs as further reference will add to the profitability. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I will try this one on M5 Gold with Speed Threshold of 100 pps. 300SL, 2000TP and 600TS. Using M30, H4, D1.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi IndexScalper, I am not familiar with DAX, may I ask what Speed Threshold are you using on DAX ? Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Is the "Starting hour" and "Ending hour" server time or local time? (Oh, and I´ve banked 70 pips with the new version already, looking good!)

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Started with NS05 this morning, i put max open trades =5, lotsize= 2

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Broker (Server) Time. Are we talking Real Money here ... If yes, be careful ... we are still test driving ...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I still have some reservations on multiple orders per pair. My initial setting was 3 and I changed it back to 1. I even closed one of the two GBP trades (that were opened using initial setting) for 100 points profit, and kept only one working.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Max Threshold reading for Gold so far is +29 vs -32. I thought Gold will have more than these readings, or maybe its quite day. I will leave Gold Threshold at 100 pps for 2 hours and see what happens.

Hi there, regarding DAX, I just used the EA (and now the indi version) exactly as it came out of the box, except with the indi I changed the higher TFs to 5m, 15m, and H1. By the way, with regard to the higher TFs do the tick counts relate to the last closed candle or is it dynamic eg for the H1 setting is it looking at the exact last 60 minutes or last closed candle? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
if anyone has any recommendations on changes to make to the settings for the DAX please shout them out, happy to test them all!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi IndexScalper, As a scalper of the DAX and CAC40 (i'm french), i just let the EA and the indi running out for the day. I will check the result tonight. Basically i changed the higher TF as you do (M5, M15 and H1). I think this tools can improve our ratio of win trades.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Just came out of a loooong meeting with staff. Its static IndexScalper, however you gave me an excellent idea, what if we make it dynamic ? it will be closer to Price Action

--- 帖子 #327 ---
GBPUSD chopped me up and down today. First Trade went into over +450 points (45 pips) before closing at TS of 3 pips . Maybe I was too optimistic on targets.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
FIRST rule of scalping...kill greed. take small profits. Its called scalping for a reason. Except if you are just trend trading of course... Good job you are doing...

--- 帖子 #329 ---
OK. Closed current trades manually. Changed the TFs to M15, H1, H4 and reduced Risk:Reward to 2:3. Speed for Gold to 50 pps instead of 100.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
hi Jb38, that's interesting. We should compare notes here. I'm not looking for an automated solution, I manually trade and am happy to carry on doing so, it would be great if it turns out incorporating the Need4speed indi increases profitability. Also I had never properly considered the CAC40 as an instrument to trade but I see I can get the same spread as per DAX so I now have a CAC40 chart running with my DAX template on it and will watch. Thanks. I occasionally trade FTSE but find that too slow, hopefully The CAC40 will be more like the lovely DAX!

Hello Khalil bro, Just in confusion as missed some post, try to re-read but want your confirmation. We need to run EA version 05 along with these two indicators?

An idea? Impulses are useful for scalping ? Try a 2 pip stop; and a 2 pip trailing stop with a high Threshold..(and if you'd like a MASSIVE TP)

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hello IndexScalper, what PPS you are using for DAX?? I am also lover of dax

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I am trying different scenarios. So far the best signals are : - Bull Signals at bottoms or Support Levels - Bear Signals at tops or Resistance Levels Worst Signals are the opposite : - Bull Signals at tops or Resistance Levels - Bear Signals at bottoms or Support Levels Best Time Frames M1 and M5. Higher time frames filters didn't make big difference. Better be traded manually with good TA. Aggressive Mode with: no SL /small TP/multiple orders/No Close on Opposite Signal can do wonders at news time.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hello Bro, I agree that manual trade with TA will be good but you need to educate us and give some example.

Here is a quick example using only Round Number as Resistance. Although Bears were not very strong at this area, but the trade has high probability. Attached Image (click to enlarge) More to come later on.

Hi Abokvaik, If i would use a robot like nfs, i would only use it at places marked in yellow, above or below Bollinger band deviaton 1 (red line), (BB deviaton 2 is black)). And only in the direction of the bands. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Dragan

--- 帖子 #343 ---
yes it will be .v.good around h/l bb. But I won't care much about the direction if enough impulses are present. Even at middle band as Support/Resistance. It was on my mind to show an example on BB when a whole candle prints outside the bands then watch for counter trend impulses for an expected reversal targeting middle band. Thanks for sharing your thoughts Dragan

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi all I have red back all history and I will give my feedback after testing this strategy on demo. Thank you for sharing this EA : ) Cheers

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I don't understand why would you look for counter trend. Point is to make it easier, not harder. Also the middle band (20SMA is too tricky). I would do it like this: 1. price on D1 must be below or above BB1 outer band 2. price on H1 must be below or above BB1 outer band 3. outer band must be pointing up for buy, or down for sell 4. robot starts looking for trades ONLY in the direction of the trend If the price is below or above BB1 outer band, then it is trending.

Shukran Khalil for your work, I want to share how I have been using your indicator this week. The picture is pretty self explanatory. Just scalping 3-10 pips but hey...still better than nothing, especially if there is almost no drawdown. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Hermez, There are two versions working as indicators 1. n4s_indy_01.ex4 : Is a Real Indicator, you copy it to the Indicators Folder. 2. n4s_ind_01.ex4 : Is an Expert acting as an indicator, you copy it to the Experts Folder. You only need one of these. And its better to use the real indicator. n4s_indy_01.ex4

Hi Protex, Good for you .

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I have to say that I might have made a super car but i couldn't drive it. I am sure that many of you can drive it better than me. Or may be we should put Sting in it (for TopGear fans). Well, I am still discovering the ways the indicator/expert can be used. The original idea came to fill the gap for retailers who don't have access to Real Volume. So the target was to provide some indication on real volume instead of MT4 tick volume.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Right and what would be the N4S_05.ex4? I put it on the indicators folder but not pressed the template.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Khalil, thanks for your effort, just suggestion I like Protex idea how to use it so maybe as a first step can we or better you change the logic of your EA to the mentioned by Protex to see how performing? If ok we can integrate more suggested features by other users. just my two cents

Hello everyone, I received a PM today from a good guy, saying: Hi it may be possible to bring these 2 projects together http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=536931 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=538347 First of all, I think MathTrader7 is doing a very good job . Let me also share with you a PM I received from MathTrader on Apr 29, 2015 6:54pm with title "EA to Post ?" Hi abokwaik, I have written an EA based on your idea, and I would like to share it with other traders. Do you let me to post it in your thread? If not, I understand you, and there will be no offense :-) Best, Math I replied to him on Apr 29, 2015 10:03pm my reply : Hi Math, Your most welcome. Thanks. Khalil Now I knew that he made a new thread about similar idea ... That's OK although he didn't mention or referred anything to me or about this thread. However, My Answer to the First PM and to you all guys, My Answer to the Message is YES, Why Not, I am ready to share all related information. I will be very pleased if these 2 projects are brought together under MathTrader name as he might have more free time than me. Thank you all, Khalil

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Khalil! You are doing a great job man! The reason I didn't post my EA to your thread was just that I thought, after your confirmation PM, that it may be better not to mess your thread up here with my posts. Another reason that I opened a separate thread was because this thread is about a trading system, while I decided to first share my indicator under the Platform Tech forum to receive traders opinion about and further development. Nevertheless, we both are following more or less the same idea for scalping the market. At the moment I'm doing some scalping experiment with my EA, with and without server side stop loss and take profit. I'm closely following your great work mate! Best, Math

Hello, I was reading the posts and saw that recommended configure Ea to trade manul. I ask, my broker is 5 digits, where and how I set up the digits of t \ s? can you give an example? What is the best configuration for M1 and M5? advises testing in m1? Thank you. I also agree that two heads are better than 1. If agree on the two come together would be cool. Could even do an EA (with manual trader option) opensource, we would go to paying monthly fee to use it, and so prevents it from ever and die or to be perfected. thank you

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Trailing stop is in points . For example you can set it to 100 if you want to trail every 10 pips. Trailing Jump is used for reducing order modification s as some brokers will not allow for huge number of order modification s in a short time. You can set trailing jump to 5 or 10 points.Using it on M1 time frame seems to be OK.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I hope when the future versions of this EA come out it will remain open source.

Some good ideas suggested by members this week : dragan9 : Using bollinger bands as a filter. Post 345 Thoughts : (Through PM) suggested that we apply the algo purely as an auto scalper with these settings on a TRUE ECN broker: - Threshold of 30 points a second (for EU), 60 points/sec for more volatile instruments (Gold, GBPJPY etc). - Immediate Entry/Aggressive Option (as youve termed it) - 2 pip SL - 2 pip Trailing Stop - 20 pip TP Protex : Second Signal Confirmation. IndexScalper : Dynamic Time Speed Counters Thanks guys for your valuable input. Kindly remind me if I missed other suggestions. I will further study these suggestions and see what I can apply for next version.

Why it doesn't open trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I only get alert sound. Edit Post: Finally it did open one trade... but it took times.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi PipsFestival, Sorry for the late reply. 1. I noticed that you are using a speed of 20/10 (20 Points per 10 seconds=2pps), which is very SLOW, and will give you MANY False Signals. For a pair like EUR/USD or GBP/USD you need at least a speed of 20 points per 1 second (20pps). 2. You have selected the "Supported Entry" which will open a trade at the end of the bar ONLY IF Impulses Count of Same Bar Type (Bullish or Bearish) is larger than Impulses of the other type. (i.e. Buy only if Bull Impulses are more than Bear impulses on a Bullish Bar).

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hopefully I will find some time to prepare a brief using manual with the next version.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thx for the reply. Ok, so if I wanna trades as soon as I get my conditions, should I select "agressive entry"? you said slow because trades can't be opened before the end of the run (10 sec) so should I use timeframe = 1Minute?... so I get 6 attemps / bar

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I could have realised my first winning session as I made + 234 pips on GBPNZD in one night right after the gap. However performance is negative due to partial close. Attached Image (click to enlarge) How can I cancel this feature thanks. (I could set up "Partial TP" = 0.00) but I guess this would generate tons of error. Cheers

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Sorry for the late reply. To disable the Partial TP you set "Partial TP Lot Size" to 0 and/or "Partial TP in Points" to 0. What worries me is that you have a Very Messy Chart with load of false signals. Either you have set Speed Threshold to a small number or you set the Time to large number which is wrong. With Correct Speed Setup your Chart should have Impulse Counts show on ONLY FEW Bars. Yours is showing impulses on almost every single bar which means that you are not using the suitable speed for this pair.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Has anyone been able to come up with good settings and results with this EA? I can't seem to find the right settings that work for me yet.

20 pps is suitable for EU and GU. You can apply the EA (v5) to M30. Disable filters.I am trading it manually now exploreing the possibilitis in order to incorporate what works in version 6.

I forgot to test it today... what shame because GBPNZD rose from 500 pips in a day. So it would have been fantastic.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Protex, could you please post more examples as your chart is a bit confusing for me like how many candles from current signal is a next valid confirming signal? etc. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
The image is confusing because you are focusing on the wrong thing... Is not about how many candles after the signal, but instead how many signals in the same direction you are receiving. Let say we ignore PA, just for the sake of the example like I did in the picture previously posted. Frequent and strong signals imply that one direction is predominant in that particular moment.

Shame EA doesn't open trade where I want: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I wish 10 pips in 10 seconds... it should open trade straight away. It should have opened Long around 2.1174 that would be nice...unless it doesn't make 10 pips in 10 sec at that time and only at the end of the bar. Also I don't want B/E or any trailing... so I set zero on the 3 parameters? Trailing Stop in Points Trail Jump in points Break even pips Cheers

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hey PF, Why you set the speed to 100/10, this means that EA will have to wait 10 seconds before checking the speed. I suggest changing that to 10/1 or better be 20/1 or even more as this is a volatile pair. Regards

It has been a few days and I just wanted to update here that I have been very happily using this brilliant tool on the DAX, incorporating it with the Bands MT4 indi as well as an oscillator taking reverse trades when the price hits the outer Band at the same time that we get a higher count in the opposite direction - ie taking a counter trade. I am using the EA version of the indi, the original version in fact and I have made no changes to the settings except to turn the alert off as I don't need the sound on. This is an excellent piece of work so thank you very much again for sharing it with us.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Actually, I believe I am using the original EA version although I did download later versions to compare. Happy to identify which version I am using if someone can tell me how I do that?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi IndexScalper, I am happy that you have found some good use for the tool. As for identifying which version you're using, version number is appended to the EA file name, for example N4S_04 is version 4, N4S_05 is version 5 . You can find more descriptive details about the version is in the EA Properties window. I agree with your previous post on identifying short-term reversals using this tool. Other Uses : it works great around ranges for possible break outs. I've noticed also signal accumulation just before red news (as those guys receive news a minute or two before its publicly available). Still studying, but making a consistently profitable robot out of this will be the real challenge. Green Pips with your DAX trading, Khalil

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi Khalil, Right. In that case for people's information I am using the EA version N4S_03. Very interesting what you say about the breakout and news opportunities, I will watch for these too. I will keep reporting back here how things are going with the EA. many thanks and best of success to you too!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Just a little suggestion for Khalil: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If Max Orders = 2 and we create a bool param (Secure last Opened trade = true) So it would be allowed to open a new trade only when last opened trade would be secured (SL on B/E at least) This way EA tends to add to the winning position while the last one opened is in green territory.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Great Suggestion. In some of my robots that average up I have a parameter for minimum distance between open orders. So I might apply the same here. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
This could be good too. Also we need to check market conditions: Right after the news, market can jump and for a couple of seconds, the spread can widen too much. EA must check spread... otherwise I'll be dead each time a news comes up. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi Abokwaik, thanks for your time and effort. got a question I tried to backtest EA on strategy tester but it did not work, impulses were not showing in back test. would it be possible to do so. Thanks

Oh sorry you have answered in the beginning.

I intalled V5 EA on mt4 pound doller pair and its placing only sell order there is not a single buy order. I placed EA in other broker mt4 and did not place even a single order I waited for hours and hours and kept on changing the settings of EA. Could anybody help me out with this please.

Hi Khalil, Its a long time since we spoke,... how are You ? I am enjoying watching this thread..... the Money Management and Lot sizes scare me but it appears that You are happy with them and the System seems to be working pretty well now. Well done ! I have a Forward Test for EA running here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=539218 Regards, David

--- 帖子 #399 ---
. With reference to GU, the move up completed, we have a little 5 wave move down so expect a 3 leg move up and then 5 more waves down for today or so

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi David A long time indeed. I hope you're doing well. As for Need4Speed, I am still studying different possibilities, trying different options, nothing solid yet, but I believe it has potential. Large Lot Sizes comes with the scalping nature of the signals. I agree that Money Management should be more safer. Good luck with your new thread.

I am not an EW expert, I am relying solely on EA signals, and enter/exit manually, some discretion is there of course.

Just my observation I noted during testig of the ea version N4S_05. It is openeing trades on next candle when signal appear but it is showing it on previous candle so if possible to modify it to start trading on previous candle. thanks

--- 帖子 #404 ---
also noted that the performance of your ea looks pretty good this week compares to the past. could you please share you settings and explain what you changed on it? thanks

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi guys on here newly convert to MT4 here so please handle with care!! Trade the dax too so was wondering IndexScalper what is the Bands MT4 indi? is it a downloaded indi or already on the MT4 platform in the navigator Bar? Used to use BB bands over extensions for PA snap backs for scalp trades. But am looking to try and use this EA manually for that instead. Plus have down loaded the latest version from here and am getting Buy sell counts above every candle on M5 charts, have not changed the Properties on the EA so it is all on the Default settings. Am I correct in thinking it should only be showing numbers above/below key candles of interest? Thank you for any help and keep up the great work.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I am sorry for delayed responses, as I've been busy last few days as we were moving to new offices and other stuff. As for the attached Trade Explorer its worth to mention that it is not traded using one method, as I am trying different methods of trading the N4S Signals. Last week most entries were done using Signals on OB and OS areas, or with personal bias (buy only, sell only on specif days). I have to do multiple forward tests (mostly manually) as back testing is not possible using the fast timing the system is working on. It is clear to me now that Need4Speed should offer different driving modes : Turbo, Sport, Manual, Eco, Snow... just to name a few ...

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi libbo, Each instrument (or pair) has different speed settings. The default settings in the EA are for EURUSD, so I don't think it will fit DAX. If you are receiving signals on every bar it means that the speed settings are not suitable for the instrument, and you should Increase the speed threshold until you receive signals on for example 1 of every 10 bars at least (depending on time frame used). I believe IndexScalper can tell which is the optimum speed for DAX. As for BB I think he's using the standard MT4 BB, but two instead of one, Outer BB with 2 std.dev and Inner with 1 std.dev.) @IndexScalper : correct me if I am wrong.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Yes teapeak, version 5 is does not support the Aggressive mode. As I mentioned in my previous post I will try to support the robot with different Driving Modes (Turbo or Race mode) is one of them and will be suitable for news time. More to come on this, but I need some time for more testing ... Regards

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Signals on OB/OS Plus Market Bias, nothing solid yet, still experimental and traded manually. I think I should remove the Trade Explorer as it might be confusing

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi maxtill, I missed your post. It can open trades auto. Or you can "disable live trading" from EA properties, and trade the signals manually.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi gharti, do you still have this issue ? If yes, check the Journal for any errors.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi abokwalk thank you for the quick response, hopefully IndexScalper will be able to help me with the fine tuning of this promising looking EA

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi http://assets.forexfactory.net/nfs/c...ar295218_9.gif abokwaik. Yeah facing same issue in one another broker it was opening only sell positions. No body told me how to fix this so stopped using this EA will try on Monday again and inform you. Bty in V5 I do not see Break Even option? Thanks

--- 帖子 #414 ---
hi there, try this , after u attach the EA - right click on the chart - expert advisor - properties - under common tab make sure to set long &amp; short positions. Maybe that will help.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hello Libbo and Khalil, apologies for the delay in my reply, Forex Factory is not updating me each time there is a new post on this thread. Libbo the Bands indicator is standard in all my MT4 broker accounts. You can find it in Indicators/Examples/Bands. I just applied it to the chart without changing any settings. As far as I can tell it is just a version of standard Bollinger Bands. I also use the standard MT4 stochastic indicator (Indicators/Examples/Stochastics) set to 5:3:3. If you look for Sell trades when a Buy candle has breached or at least touched the upper Bands level in combination with the same candle showing as being overbought on the stochs and Khalil's indicator showing a higher number of Sell ticks than Buy. All reversed for a Buy trade. These are therefore reversal or counter-trend trades. They are very effective on DAX, I stopped on 20 points this morning. Incidentally I did not change anything in the EA when I applied it to the charts and am therefore getting Buy and Sell tick counts above and below every candle and am simply looking for the occasions when one count exceeds the other in the set-up as described above. I do all of this on the 1m chart although I am also now looking at a range bar chart to see what that can deliver. Khalil I hope my use of the EA as described here does not offend you if you think I am using it incorrectly. I appreciate it may be counter-intuitive how I am using it but I have seen this work for nearly a month and have been happily trading it live for half that time. If anyone has any suggestions how else to improve this please advise, otherwise thanks as ever to Khalil for sharing this great tool.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Greetings Khalil Abokwaik, I have been using your system for a while and the result is amazing. I have a lot of profit position then loss. The problem that i have is the profit amount is small even though the quantity of profit position is more then loss position. When come to loss the amount is big, so when overall end up with loss. I have using the N4S_4. Is there any setting that came make PARTIAL SL LOT SIZE? i have attach the screen shot of my settings. Im using it in EURUSD M30 chart.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi Indexscalper thank you for the reply I use something similar with an RSI b4. What was you R:R to this scalping method?

hi Libbo, 1:1 is the R2R for me, looking for 10 points a trade.

lol chopped out of a couple of shorts using IndexScalper Method this morning, but trying to stand in front of a speeding train on the dax kills no matter what your Strategies are!! Will look at mayb long scalps today.....

Nice one thanks I tried with a tighter stop then 10 and was tagged before the reversal so may I ask how did you fair with the 10 stop this morning?

Version 4 counts the number of impulses regardless of impulse power while Version 5 takes impulse power into consideration.

100% in a Month !! Credit to You Brother !! That is 3 times my Annual Target LOL

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi abokwaik! Can you share your seting for EA, thx for your time!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Beginner's Luck !

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I am using the robot for signals and trade them manually around overbought/oversold and range areas with averaging up/down based on signal power. For E/U &amp; G/U speed=20 pps. For U/J speed=15 and for GOLD speed=30. As I said earlier I am still figuring out the best uses of the information the EA provides and will try to squeeze as much as I can in different types of robots to trade it automatically.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Well done abokwait Could you introduce a RSI filter (or stoch) to choose the overbought/oversold areas ?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yes. Manually I've been using stochastic with default settings and wait for a bounce off 50, or a cross down above 80 or cross up below 20.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Great work Abokwaik!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
hi abokwaik, does the ea includes the indicator shown in 1st post?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I'll try with conners RSI and test... Also Tro Wick Zone

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I am using N4S_05 which is an EA but I am using it as an indicator (disable live trading), and used the impulses count to decide on entry/exit. There is a link to it in 1st post.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
If you use stoch to take your decision, maybe it's easy to include this option in the EA ?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
True. The thing is that I didn't have the chance to do any development last week. As I mentioned earlier, we will have EAs with different driving modes: Turbo, 4x4, RushHour, ... etc.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I read from post 1 till the last one, but i find the lack of explanation or definition of these terms: MxBulls CrSpeed MxBear Power Numbers shown above/below candle Do you mind recap a little bit here? and how do we apply it in manual trading.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Not at all belief, Lets first define the Speed, as everything else is related to it. Speed : You car speed is measured by Kilo Meter Per Hour (KMPH) or Miles Per Hour (MPH) Price speed ​ is measured by Points Per Second (PPS). So basically it means How many points price moved in a second. depending on your broker, this number can be expressed in Points for 5-digit brokers or Pips for 4-digit brokers Until now I allowed the Time in seconds to be specified by the user (to be 1, 2, 3 seconds or any number) , to cater for slow computers or large number of charts with the EA on, but after experimenting I don't think its necessary, plus it created confusion, so Future versions will be hard coded with 1 second only for the Time Input Parameter. MxBulls : ​ This number represents the maximum Bullish (UP) speed in PPS. This number will get reset if EA is restarted, or Time Frame changed This number will be relevant in a Day or a Trading Session, so its better to reset it at least Daily This number will be very high during red news, some times it reached over 300 pps, which means price jumped 300 points (30 pips) in ONE SECOND. This can be due to Big Money entering the market, OR, Stop Hunting MxBears : ​​This number represents the maximum Bearish (Down) speed in PPS. This number will get reset if EA is restarted, or Time Frame changed This number will be relevant in a Day or a Trading Session, so its better to reset it at least Daily This number will be very high during red news, some times it reached over 300 pps, which means price fall 300 points (30 pips) in ONE SECOND. This can be due to Big Money entering the market, OR, Stop Hunting CrSpeed : Current Speed in pps This number will change every second to reflect the current price speed (Green, Positive=UP, Red, Negative=Down) Impulse : ​ Whenever speed exceeds the input parameter called "Speed Threshold", for example 20pps, an Impulse is created The Numbers Below the bars: ​ These numbers indicated the number of Bullish Impulses that took place during that bar lifetime. The Numbers Above the bars: ​ These numbers indicated the number of Bearish Impulses that took place during that bar lifetime. Power : ​ In versions prior to version 5, I was measuring the number of Impulses in a bar regardless of the Impulse power. So for example lets take an M5 bar, and suppose we set the Speed Threshold to 20pps. And assume the following impulses took place during the bar lifetime (5 Minutes): +35 , -21 , +66 , -25 , -22 , +42 In versions prior to version 5 the bar will show 3 below the bar and 3 above the bar, which means Bulls Power = Bears Power In version 5 (and later), the bar will show 6 below the bar and 3 above the bar, which means Bulls Power &gt; Bears Power, and this is more realistic.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
This is the Golden Question Actually some fellows already shared their method of how they trade it manually. What I offered here (IMHO) is a better interpretation of Volume, compared to Tick Volume. So one way of trading it is to Watch the Speed at AREAS of INTEREST including Support/Resistance Pivot Points Fibo retracements/extensions Over Bought/Over Sold levels Round Numbers Ranges ... etc When you observe an imbalance in Bulls/Bears Power around these areas, you simply join the stronger

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thank you for writing back with detailed explanation. How does ver5's Bull Power = 6 when the PPS Impulse in 5mins is +35, -21, +66, -25,-22 in given example? It seems like a 3 bulls power and 3 bears power to me.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Good Question, although you missed the +42 number. My Answer +35 , -21 , +66 , -25 , -22 , +42 1. Bullish Impulse translates to +35/20 = +1 (rounded) 2. Bearish Impulse translates to -21/20 = -1 (rounded) 3. Bullish Impulse translates to +66/20 = +3 (rounded) 4. Bearish Impulse translates to -25/20 = -1 (rounded) 5. Bearish Impulse translates to -22/20 = -1 (rounded) 6. Bullish Impulse translates to +42/20 = +2 (rounded) So as a total for the bar we have 6 Bullish impulses exceeded the Speed Threshold, and 3 Bearish Impulses exceeded the Speed Threshold

--- 帖子 #439 ---
So i guess what you mean by Power (which is shown below/above candles) is referred to numbers of Impulse per Speed Threshold, that is quite clear now. Abokwaik, what is your recommended setting for Trailing Stop in Points and Trail Jump in Points supposed i set 10 pips SL and 10 pips TP? It would be great to incorporate the following features in the next version: Time/Events based mode with FF daily news check, e.g. red news go larger SL/TP and, if corresponding market closed go contrarian, etc. Or perhaps we can use total volume per candle must exceed certain value in order for the trigger to work. Spread control for entry, like some mentioned, enter long on down-tick vice versa to reduce slippage. Build in OB/OS entry based on trend bias checker/filter, or built-in currency strength meter to activate the most long strongest/weakest pair, for better confluence automated EA decision making. Hopefully in ver.6. You are living it up to your motto: Learn, Share, Respect and Enjoy your life. Whoever got you as friend in real life is a blessing, thank you.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi Abokwaik, great system, definitely subscribed; and thanks for sharing! In terms of areas of interest to watch the pps (as you mentioned earlier...), I have lots of faith (from experience) in stochs (particularly the stoch signal), and fibo levels... I was thinking, how hard would it be to integrate a fibo indicator (redrawing after predefined amounts of time) combined with a stochastic? I think this can act as a fairly good filter for your strategy... On my own charts, for example, I find that a stoch signal with stock MT4 settings, and 95.5/4.5 rebound levels is right about ~85% of the time for the bar that follows the level being broken (not taking into account important news times off course!). Just sharing some thoughts, ytrader

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Khalil, thanks as ever for the N4S excellent EA. Although I have been using version three for weeks now happily on the DAX, I have also just loaded V5 onto a chart so I can compare. I like the logic of V5 over V3 but need to see if it improves the already very high success rate of V3 before switching.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Correct. If you have a small fixed TP there will be no meaning of having a Trailing Stop. Either use Trailing stop or small TP. You can set large TP (5 to 10R) and then apply a trailing stop of at leat 1R. Good ideas. As for news filter I don't think we need it as we can know it based on speed, for example EURUSD when speed exceeds 200pps its a red news for sure. And I will base the Turbo Version on this idea. Thank You

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I had a very long sleep, did't have in months Today speed is very slow so far, not much action, my speed radars didn't catch any thing in the last hour (EU,GU,UJ,Gold).

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks ytrader, I see many applications for this, OB/OS is certainly included. Fibo , I have to think it over.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks IndexScalper, your feedback is always welcome.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Oh, I just noticed its Bank Holiday in Europe. Oh No, and in US too.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Sleep is good , you need to clear your mind from time to time. I will take advantage of this bank holiday to back test some strategies. KHALIL, what is your setting for gold?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
30pps for Gold. I don't know if it will ever hit on such a quite day. GU Short is on.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
hI, i like the idea. I try it 2 years ago the same idea but the only difference was that if the signal for speed came, the EA will apply fibo retracement between start of the move and last pip and at some retracement level will enter in the direction of the move. I didn't end the EA but I remember 50% of the entries at least was profitable. With no management the EA it s useless. On testing I find out that on EU there are some settings that work, 8 pips in 3 secconds, or 16 pips on 8 10 secconds. this kind of impulse was the best set I had. With my EA I can test the past on ticks. I don t know why with your EA it s not possible but I m not a coder. You know better. I just want to say the idea can be extended. on large moves, a god set was 125 pips in 1 day move, or 31 pips in 5 min. Now I work on a grid system in correlation with news but a good idea will be to combine the grid with speed settings cos, if the news release it s relevant then the speed of the move in relation with grid levels can create a sup/res system. Maybe we can create something, who knows ... From my point of view, the speed of small moves are relevant between sup.res levels. The price get quick on a level if : 1. there was a htf activity with a purpose. 2. an exit/entry with some volume. 3. to break a level for future 4. stop loss hunt and many more. From this point, I can split the types of "moves". If a move or more appear close to an important news, let say form 15 to 2 min till the event, there are small chances to take the right direction cos the forecast was priced in already and the actual release can be in any direction. If the signals are in non event periods then the purpose it s to go closest to S/R levels for reasons like TP, Break that level, stop hunt, etc, and with that, if we know where are this levels the we will know where is the TP and where will reverse, which is gold i think.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I fully agree with barbones about the usefulness of fibo retracements in this (also as I mentioned in an earlier post...) . For example I think if the EA drew new fibo lines, say every one or two hours, and properly integrated these into its analyses, some loosing trades like this one yesterday could be avoided

I test really small lot size on real account but it didn't trigger during the last nzd and jpy news, using this settings: Attached Image (click to enlarge) A couple of questions come to mind: Is it because i should make Risk Percentage = 0 when i specify the Lot Size? Can the Starting Hour and Ending Hour using this format 211459 to refer to to broker time 21:14:59 (HH:MM:SS) ? Is there going to be a message if Slippage occur? to rule out the possibility of "no trigger no alert" during news? About Impulses on Higher Time Frames, if enabled, will the EA need wait to collect enough data in order for the trigger to occur? I hope you could clarify a little how it works such as what is the significance of using HTF Impulses and HTF Bar Direction? Should it be off to trade news? and when should it be on? On Magic Number, must it be different on every chart windows (different pairs) that is opened? For Ver5, can it work on any timeframe or is it better to use 1m chart? Dear Abokwaik, I will make proper corrections upon your advice, hopefully soon enough to test for next CHF Employment news, and report back later.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi belief, ------------------------- I test really small lot size on real account but it didn't trigger during the last nzd and jpy news, using this settings: ... A couple of questions come to mind: ------------------------- Q1 : Is it because i should make Risk Percentage = 0 when i specify the Lot Size? A1 : No. If Lot size is specified, Percentage will be not used. ------------------------- Q2 : Can the Starting Hour and Ending Hour using this format 211459 to refer to to broker time 21:14:59 (HH:MM:SS) ? A2 : Starting Hour should be less than Ending Hour. Format is H24 (i.e 0,1, 2, ..., 23) ------------------------- Q3 : Is there going to be a message if Slippage occur? A3 : No. ------------------------- Q4 : About Impulses on Higher Time Frames, if enabled, will the EA need wait to collect enough data in order for the trigger to occur? A4: Yes. ------------------------- Q5 : I hope you could clarify a little how it works such as what is the significance of using HTF Impulses and HTF Bar Direction? Should it be off to trade news? and when should it be on? A5 : If HTF Impulses is enabled, Trade will trigger if the current bar closes with bull/bear power difference in the direction of the HTF Impulses. If HTF Bar Direction is enabled, Trade will trigger if the current bar closes with bull/bear power difference in the direction of the HTF Bar Direction. Both can be combined. This of course will limit the number of trades taken, and will not allow for a counter trend trades. ------------------------- Q6 : Should it be off to trade news? and when should it be on? A6: News is Irrelevant. It can be on or off according to your risk appetite. As I said earlier, I will be working on a news version of the EA --&gt; n4s_Turbo, hopefully will be ready soon. ------------------------- Q7 : On Magic Number, must it be different on every chart windows (different pairs) that is opened? A7 : Yes. Or EA trades will be mixed, and EAs will fight to open/close each others trades. ------------------------- Q8 : For Ver5, can it work on any timeframe or is it better to use 1m chart? A8 : It can work on any time frame, but remember in V5 Trigger will take place at Bar Close, so fo Aggressive Trading, you better choose low time frames (M1, M5). ------------------------- Regards, Khalil

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Khalil, when using M1 chart, is the code ready for following changes higher time frame 1 to 'M5' higher time frame 2 to 'M15' higher time frame 3 to 'M30' so that it react faster compared to the default H1, H4, D1? (Since we are talking about short term scalping here) will this changes affect any and what would that be?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Absolutely, 5,15,30 are more suitable as HTF for M1. Default Settings were meant for M15 or M30.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
i dont see the numbers above each candle using v5. has that feature been removed?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Abokwalk Thank you for what you are offering here, I am finding it very useful. I trade manually with a separate EA to manage my trades after entry, it would be great if you could make version 5 into a indicator only.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Dear Khalil, is it possible to add Starting Hour: Minute and Ending Hour: Minute in next version? If i can only make 1 request, this would be the one. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
OK. OK. Just allow me some time as I am really overwhelmed with my daily job.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Need4Speed Turbo Version (News Version). For Majors Speed Threshold should be at least 100 PPS (100 Points Per Second = 10 Pips Per Second) This will work in Aggressive Mode : Whenever Speed Exceeds the Speed Threshold (Not at bar close as it will be too late). Filters are disabled by default. I've also changed the Start and Ending Hours to Start and Ending Times. These should be entered in HHMM format (i.e. 0115 for 01:15, 1530 for 15:30 ... etc). TESTING ONLY PLEASE

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I've attached the Turbo version to USDCAD, GBPCAD for Red CAD news today. Speed 150PPS for USDCAD, and 200PPS for GBPCAD Lots=1 SL=TP=500 Points for USDCAD and 750 for GBPCAD No Filters This is running on a new account with 10K St. Bal . EDIT : Changed inputs for both pairs.

thank you abokwaik ! It maybe better if add some option, such as when target reach to stop trade.

thanks abokwaik love playing with your indi I found I get the most signals using JFD broker mt4 demo with Gold Asian session set to 75 and Dax and Dow 30 set to 55.. I will try on 30 sec Bi options .. . *Reason for using the Bi options to scalp is that there is no spread ..if you buy a usdJpy call at 121.349 it pays 85% if it expires Any points in the money above 121.349 from the price when you push the buy button.. Long the usd yen * note 10 green and only 2 red on 15 min--looking for 5 to 10 pips *Note only 5 point spread on jfd Edit closed for a quik 5 and 6 pips Good pips to all

Hi High Fivve, Nice to see someone else working with the the DAX, I will take a look at your 55 setting. Can you tell me please which version of EA are you using? Thanks.[/quote] Hey Indexscalper hope you are well I am using V 4 indi ..as I can just have in a template to apply to any chart -someone correct me if I am wrong but wit an EA you must apply each time... what set-up are you using With need4speed or are you using it solo? best regards ..

--- 帖子 #465 ---
hi HF, I am using Version three in combination with the MT4 Bands indicator and standard MT4 stocks at 5,3,3 and Williams %R set at 22. When the N4S gives a reversal (eg higher Bear count in a Bull candle) where that same candle has touched or pierced the Bands and the stochs/Williams both showing overbought then I sell for 10 points. Are you using a stochs indi too? Looks like it from your chart? Always interested to see different variations of indicators I'm using.

Are you using a stochs indi too? Looks like it from your chart? Always interested to see different variations of indicators I'm using.[/quote] Yes I use MTF stoc --but in very short TF It may not play.. I am open to anything atm lol-- what TF are you using? good pips all

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi again, I trade off the 1m chart for DAX, you need to be sharp to scalp the DAX. I never heard of the MTF stochs that is interesting, I will try to find it in MT4.

I used 50pps on N4STurbo for all majors since yesterday no trigger yet, guess need to wait for next major news and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
For some reason, no order trigger the red AUD news, maybe slippage too large? for the starting and ending time, can we leave it empty to let it on at all time? also, need to add that if you tried enter timing 0xxx it doesn't allow.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
For all time trading set it from 0000 to 9999

--- 帖子 #471 ---
USDJPY just showed -62 Bear Speed few minutes ago. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Check if you're on 4-digit or 5-digit broker. 50pps on a 5-digit broker = 5pps on a 4-digit broker.

Hi is it the speed threshold set to 55 on the dax? thank you

--- 帖子 #473 ---
unable to enter number starting with 0xxx

--- 帖子 #474 ---
yes I was getting too many signals on the 20 setting -using my JFD broker so at 55 I get a good amount.. I would try different setting tell you get a nice flow 1 or more per min ..GL

--- 帖子 #475 ---
there is a scenario of false trigger if you lose internet connection shortly and reconnected later, your price feed will catch up drastically and falsely caused N4S EA to trigger market order.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Ooops, You're right (it was defined as integer). Fixed EA attached.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Right. I will work out a solution for that.

Dear Khalil Thank you for your scalping system. Actually I have problem in closing the trades with N4S_03. Can you please add the buttons of Close Trade (Fast Close One by One) and Close All (Only with which Pair the EA is attached) instead of Buy Stop an Sell Stop. Thank you. Regards.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Today, i have achieved good results using N4S_05 in DEMO. I also run a order management EA and a indicator -- CurrencySthength. Therefore, if combine the indi is better in EA. my 2 cent.

Hello Ighr, what are your settings to achieve these results? I assume you trade manually? TX

--- 帖子 #481 ---
The currency strength idea is always of interest to me but I trade the DAX index. Does anyone know of an 'Index Strength' indicator please?

And I should also have said that today the N4S version 3 EA in combination with Stochs and Bands has been good for 30 points ++. Nice.

Thanks very much doerpn, I'll take a look!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Quoting logic38 Hi Abokwalk Thank you for what you are offering here, I am finding it very useful. I trade manually with a separate EA to manage my trades after entry, it would be great if you could make version 5 into a indicator only. OK. Just allow me some time as I am really overwhelmed with my daily job. Learn, Share, Respect and Enjoy your life Abokwalk just a little reminder, if you get a chance, thank you

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I was driving like a crazy last week, at a very high speed, never used breaks, ignored all the signals, including the red ones, which eventually broke my car into pieces. Account went up to 130% in 20 days, and the went down to -60% in 5 days. Trading at high leverage with no stops is definitely a failure formula.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hey, Always accept your tight loss... : ) I would like to share my idea, if you can add it to your indi that would be great ^^ For these who trade this strategy manually or not, I recommend to use csDash and focus the the pairs on top and only allow to trade one direction (buy or sell) http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...19#post8241719 Cheers

Need4Speed Histogram Indicator This is a pure indicator, and it uses regular timing (not OnTimer function), so it can be used for back testing. For MQL Coders : You can use it with EAs using iCustom. Index 0 for Bears, Index 1 for Bulls. It uses the logic of N4S_05 (Impulse Power). This is a screen shot using MT4i Trading Simulater v2 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #489 ---
some flaw in strategy using this EA is that the price has already move so much and when u tried to chase it with this EA slippage is too much to pay, and often it would reverse on you, unless there is a MTF stochastic filter.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi guys can someone explain how to use the CR Count? thanks

--- 帖子 #491 ---
What do you mean by CR, if you mean Cr_Speed (Current Speed), it is the number of Points or Pips the price traveled in the last time unite (1 second, or whatever you set in the inputs).

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Yes I am not sure how to incorporate it to the rest of the EA. I am trying to set a suitable input for M5 dax chart using the turbo set up(latest) I know some have a 10 Limit/10 Stop but would really need a 2;1 Ratio minimum for Money management.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Current Speed is not used in Robot, it is informative only. What is used is the Speed Threshold . You need to monitor the robot (while disable Live Trading), to see the Maximum Bull/Bear Readings and use a number close to the Max for Turbo Trading. For Example if during Red News Max Speed reached 340 (or -340), while on regular times its around 120 (or -120), then a good setting would be above between 200 and 300 for Speed Threshold in order to catch the big move on red news.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Ok so turn off the Live trading in the EA Properties? thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Can this work to be able to do some backtesting ? It will never be like the real OnTimer function call, but with some good tick data shouldn't be too bad. Sorry I haven't got the time to compare live to backtesting results. Please have a go. void OnTick() { static datetime TestingTime; if(IsTesting()) { if(TimeCurrent()&gt; TestingTime + speed_timer) { //Log("OnTick for OnTImer 2 =" ,TestingTime, TimeCurrent() ); OnTimer(); TestingTime=TimeCurrent(); } } }

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hello Abokwaik, After many days of test on version 4 automated. Most of the trades are loosers. i use a 50pts sl/sp on eurusd and gbpusd and gbpjpy. Would your release a contrarian automated version? tx a lot for your great work. S

--- 帖子 #497 ---
I set up the Turbo version for the US Red news on some USD pairs, lets see how it will do.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
EURUSD gave misleading signal, showing 139 Bulls vs -78 Bears, and it went down sharply, I don't know what to read from this. But it seems to me the Turbo version is very dangerous.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I am in favor of no further automation of this system, and use it for manual trading only, and then translate what works on manual to auto if possible. For people who would like to further automate, an indicator has been already provided which they can setup and use in their automation. Regards, Khalil

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Abokwaik, Wouldn't you test the parameters i use on the 3 markets in automated? i guarantee it losses 70% of the time so in a contrarian mode we would do a killing. please consider. tx S

Hi just stopping in briefly to say that I am LOVING your histogram indicator on DAX 1mTF. I am still finessing its use although keeping it as simple as possible. Your work is brilliant, well done.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hello Abokwaik, I admit i am really lost after having reading all the thread. Could you resume which version you use, TF, markets, automated or manual? I still don't undertsand how the system works and what are the rules!! sorry for asking again. tx a lot S

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi S, I am sorry to hear that. You're probably right as I jumped from car to car and from race to race, and switched from auto to manual, and from manual to auto during this short trip. My only excuse is that I am still TEST DRIVING. Anyway, the latest work was Semi - Manual, (i.e using N4S_05, or N4S_Turbo EAs for Signals , While Entering/Exiting Manually at interesting areas). Interesting areas include (OB/OS, S/R, Fibs, Pivots ... etc). Regards, Khalil

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Abokwaik, tx for your answer. You mean for example that in a OB situation you will only enter sell signal? could you explain cleary how do you use signals in manual trading or maybe tell which post describes this. thank you. S

--- 帖子 #512 ---
look at Gold Short example from post 507, today and yesterday low were broken with extreme bear power while stoch is still outside OS level, BB pointing to the outside. I think I opened 5 positions around this area all ended with profit.I will try to post some live examples next week.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
It most certainly does look very good. The only question I have is "What is your avg drawdown in pips?" The only reason why I ask is because you could have a very small drawdown % wise, but very high drawdown in pips.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hello abokwaik. Thank you for sharing this wonderful work. I have a problem with the configuration of the expert, which is what I do wrong. Can you help me to open operaciones.Hace several hours but not working. Thanks in advance. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #515 ---
The settings are saying 150 pps which can only happen in Extreme RED News (NFP, Rate change ...).You might want to reduce the speed to 50 pps for regular red news on majors.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I don't think FF Trade Explorer or MT4 provide such details. The account is available on myfxbook : Need4Speed Turbo. I think it provides more details there.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Abokwaik, Using NS5 what rule do you use to enter position? which time frame is the best? How do i read the upper number (D,H4,H1,m5)? tx

--- 帖子 #518 ---
In the end you probably just need to focus on 2 strategy: Ranging and Trending What you need to decide when coding would be to detect upcoming news to build in your gps system to auto drive according to highway flat surface drive or roller coaster ride mode. If any of your system not cater for both scenario it would surely be fail at some point accident, so you need to check the road ahead before using the right gear.

Hi members , i Use a 4 Digit account so there must be changes in the values to enter . Well Can some provide some more info . the speed interpretation on 4 digit [ 20 speed on 1 second] the speed interpretation on 5 digit [ 20 speed on 1 second] are these settings rite or wrong .

--- 帖子 #523 ---
All input parameters are in points, so to answer your question: the speed interpretation on 4 digit [ 20 speed on 1 second] = 20 pips per second the speed interpretation on 5 digit [ 20 speed on 1 second] = 2 pips per second

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Confused 5 digits works on points and 4 digits on pips . well the case is if 20 pips in 4 digits means 200 points in 5 digits. rite??? so [[ the speed interpretation on 5 digit [ 20 speed on 1 second] = 20 pips per second the speed interpretation on 4 digit [ 20 speed on 1 second] = 2 pips per second ]] is this interpretation rite ? ?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
The minimum fraction on a 5-digit broker is called Point or Pippet. While on a 4-digit broker it is called Pip. In General 1 Pip = 10 Points. In your case (a 4-digit broker) , a setting of 2 for "Speed Threshold", and 1 for "Time in Seconds" for majors is fine.

I'm testing this EA this morning on EURUSD and EURJPY,looks good,made 3%. My settings are: 100 points SL and 100 points TP. Added 35 point trailing stop with trail jump 35 too, trail jump 10 points now. n4s ind 01 and n4s indy seems not working,it's too bad because i wanted to trade manually with an other ea trade management.My idea was to take trades only in the trend of the day (udine system) just take another good sell +100 points see picture thanks for your work

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi Hukam, how to read that indicator that you attached ?

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi rochild, n4s ind 01 is an EA (goes under Experts folder), while n4s indy is an indicator (goes under Indicators Folder). However those which are prior to version 5 are not utilizing the Impulse Power as I explained in an earlier post HERE . For manual trading and if you don't want to use N4S_05 EA as you might be using other EA on the same chart, the best solution so far is N4S_Histogram Indicator available in post 488 HERE , you can even back test using the MT4 new feature for Back Testing Indicators , as shown below : Enjoy, Khalil

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thats all clear now thanks a lot for your explanations.I will go on with N4S_05 for the moment regards

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I do not recommend Auto Trading with any of N4S EAs atm. You can use version 5 and D isable Live Trading (from EA properties) as I do now, until I or someone can find a way of Auto Trading the beast. Green pips to you

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I started 30 minutes ago. Here is the current status of EUR/USD 2 trades so far, first was a sell closed half at 5 pips, and closed the rest at 1+ pips after getting a bullish impulse. second is a buy, already closed half at +10 pips, and remaining is active targeting day open price. Attached Image (click to enlarge) second half of long trade stopped at BE, but without a bearish signal. So I might re-enter on a new bull signal, although it is not advisable to buy under day open.

Hi Abokwaik - I've just found your interesting thread and as I have been testig several EAs on the German30 Index - aka DAX - I'm posting a chart of a very simple MA Cross EA that I am currently testing. As you doubtless know, this type of EA makes its trades on the opening of a new candle and thus your idea is interesting in that it should produce much earlier entries. The attached chart shows the recent trades - in "Only Long" mode and the pts are the maximum for each swing, so an experienced Dax trader will only loose a few points of slippage on exit, especially if he reads volumes and "levels" More examples can be found both in Delta1's thread and my old thread. I'll read through your thread and make some time to try out your EA Regards Islander

It was a tough Need4Speed_Turbo drive specially in the last 2 days, however 100%+ Equity Increase accomplished in 15 days. Another 15 days to go, if performance stayed at the same level I am going real with this one.

Hi Abokwak - I did notice when I first downloaded that there were 4 red invisables on your thread, so probably brokers checking you out - and downloading too! I've not had much time, but as far as I can see, on the 1m time frame entries in EA mode are made after the open of the next bar - the same as for the EAs that I already use. Is there a control that I am not seeing that allows an entry to be made during the 1m bar? - or are all entries limited to the open of the next bar.? Regards Islander PS Two red invisibles watching now!

If you are using version 4, there is an option for Aggressive Entry, which will open trade during the candle lifetime. PS: Invisibles are welcome, only with visible contributions.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
The ea N4S_05 can't open the trade by itself??

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Of course it can. Check the filters, and that you allowed live trading.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Not yet. At least for me, I am not live on this yet. But the concept proved that is has an edge IMHO.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hello Mr. Abokwaik, first of let me thank you for your neat EA, once calibrated I think it can perform exceptional on certain market conditions. I too had this idea/EA in my mind and tried to create it with the strategy forex builder but yours is way more sophisticated... again BIG Thank you for your work! So I ve two question and one suggestion for you: 1. In the EA properties what is the entry "magic number" stands for? 2. I set the "maximum pair orders" to 3 (for expl.) but once a trade has been made and another signal is coming in the "old trade" will be replaced by the new...means only 1 trade active all the time. Am I missing something here? Also I m using your n4s_turbo version and for my strategy it would be very very helpful if you can include a kind of "trade-cooldown" -option. What I mean by that is that once a signal--&gt; trade has been established there will be a cooldown (in minutes or seconds) when the next signal can trigger a trade. That would be super awesome! :^ ) my 2 cents keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Dear MetaMind, I am honored to have your first forexfactory post in one of my threads. Think of magic number as an ID for the EA. The EA uses the magic number to identify its own trades and orders. This becomes mandatory when running different EAs or even different instances of the same EA on a single account. I will reply to the rest of your post at a later time. Again , welcome to fore factory and welcome to need4speed. Regards, Khalil

Wife : Baby what is that?! Husband : Its a Martingale gone wrong, they should have stuck with Grid.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hi, Khalil ! Thank you for the great job. One question N4S Turbo witn default settings opened only 2 trades at last 10 days (on my demo account) What settings are you used? If settings not default, please, post .txt file

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Indeed, they should have stuck to the system. So, what went wrong ?

During the coming days, I'll be working on a reliable exit system. Although I am still in favor of manual driving mode, I realize that mistakes can be minimized by automation. I'll continue playing with these 2 accounts (on TE). Once a fully auto system is in place, I will run for a month and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi abokwaik, Make I ask how did you open position please? By EA or manual? In my experience of the past week, both N4S_5 and N4S_turbo works fine with manual interaction. However, say EA SELL E/U at 1.1300, TP hit at 1.1250 (or manual close), and experting a ranging or reversal, both N5 and N_turbo keep open sell position at lowest point. How did you deal with this situation? Is that possible to consider this in your new version? Cheers,

--- 帖子 #607 ---
just my 2cents: Fully Automate the system, Dollar Cost Averaging For Exists Using the ATR and ADR to calculate grid spacing... theres an edge on your system

--- 帖子 #608 ---
As for the first question, position open manual guided by the N4S signals. What happens, as illustrated in the above chart example, your 1st position (2nd &amp; 3rd) are according to the system, and then comes a confirmation of change, when your 3 opened positions are in loss, and you're tempted to averaging ... which proved its failure on both accounts, and surprisingly at similar profit%.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I will try to test this auto scenario on the side: 1- take every signal, buy, or sell, No SL and No TP. 2- position size is relative to impulse size. 3- close all positions at : (a) pre-set equity profit.loss (b) end of day.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Thanks for your explain.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
fantastic, im glad i had an input to that!! im also thinking you fully automate the proccess so we can help you test the best settings, eg. we all do different tp settings for optimal settings, because doing this alone will take you a very very long time, youre basicaly leveraging the forum. you achieve success quicker that way

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Does anyone trade in xuausd and want to share his/her settings?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi smika, so far I was trading xuausd ( Gold ) using 30 pps. Manual entry/exit using the signals. some trades were entered/exited blindly using smart phone ( without seeing the signals ). So nothing totally mechanical yet.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Thanks for your answer. I will test this full automaticly next week and will show the result next friday/saturday on this forum. I only use the normal version (the turbo version I will use in the future). Smika

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi abokwaik, Once again, I'm impressed by yr idea and work done!! Great job! Would you be sharing version 05 of the source code? I was wondering if it's possible to combine the EA all into one so that there is no need to run it on multiple charts.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Do you mean multiple pairs in one EA ?

--- 帖子 #617 ---
This is the MQL Source file for N4S_05 Robot.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I will delete the current experimental TEs, and create one new demo and one live TE that will trade completely in auto mode.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Yes that's what I meant.Thanks for the source code. Am excited to know you are going live. Are you still using the same set file you posted several pages ago? Can I suggest a value for the max speed? Maybe we could consider using average atr value of M1 for say the last 480 bars. In this way, it would adjust dynamically to the market conditions automatically.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I will be doing some back testing using the histogram indicator to find best settings for major pairs. Then run it on demo for a week or so ,before going live.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
good morning, I've been testing the NS TURBO for a few days, make good entries, I believe that one way to improve a little robot and minimize losses would add some options: -Only Add new trades in profit. -Option to put BE, and BE profit Thanks for your great work !!

--- 帖子 #622 ---
good day!! im scalper here. i have been following your thread here. based on malaysia time, do i need to change the starting hours in the setting for n4s_05?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hello Abokwaik, Maybe you could add some filters like oscilators to avoid false signals. what do you think? Stephane

--- 帖子 #624 ---
It uses the broker time not local time, so you can change as appropriate based on your broker time.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I am working on the new version, and will try to incorporate some of the ideas posted in the thread.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
ok fine great job S

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi Abokwaik, I ran version 05 for the last two days using stop loss 100 points and tp 100 points with trailing stop starting at 35 points for multiple pairs. The results are not that good. Are you using 200 points stop loss with tp 600 points? Is this still considered scalping? Is the signal at M15 sufficiently strong to give a 600 point tp? Thanks and waiting for your advice.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
After 2 months experimenting this system here are my findings: 1. Lower time frames can be misleading, unless if they were combined with Higher TF confirmation. 2. The system/indicator can be used for manual trading as a supporting factor for other entry methods. 3. Use at bar close 4. Ratio should be greater than 0.5 ... Bulls Ratio = (Bulls-Bears)/(Bulls+Bears), while Bears Ratio = (Bears-Bulls)/(Bears+Bulls) 5. Signal must be in the Daily Direction ... If Signal is Bullish D1 must be up, if Bearish D1 must be down, to take the signal. 6. Entry can be made on a decent retrace 7. Stop Loss Above or Below the Signal bar. 8. Take Profit at least 1xSL 9. Better close all trades before end of day wither in profit or loss. 10. Single trade per setting (per EA instance). I am going to put these findings in an EA, and publish the results.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
This is version 6 with the above points implemented (except for points 6 and 9). This version can be back tested as it uses the N4S_Histogram indicator (available on this thread) This is a back test on EUR/USD 2015 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Abokwaik, Can you publish some trade screenshot for better understanding ? Thank you for your work. Tom

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hello Abokwaik, Thank you very much for all this hard work of yours. Can we get a BE+LOCK PROFIT next version? I see there are a lot less options in this new version. [EDIT] Not sure what would be the minimum needed to trade this version, looks like it should be more then 1K.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
This is version 6 with trailing stop option (which can serve both BE+LOCK PROFIT). I think its better to trade this as intra-day system instead of quick scalping system. As for the starting balance, you can start with 100, and trade micro lots. Demo first.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Great job! Let's forward test

--- 帖子 #634 ---
thk abokwaik... wat setting is that u used? i try backtest no trades entered...hmm

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi Abokwaik, IS your latest version of EA not showing the details for daily, H4, H1... as well as speed..?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Thanks Mr Khalil, I am going to run N4S_5 next week on a demo and i will post the result as per your findings StOoOk

--- 帖子 #637 ---
It looks amazing, but in my test using tick data from Tickstory lite, we have 99% chart accuracy and a much pooer result on the similar dates and settings you have shown in your example. Can you tell me what I have done wrong or what I can alter to try and emulate your results? Can you supply your sets to check on my EA?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hello Abokwaik, I have your EA on my chart and sometimes it gives sounds like crazy. What do these sound alerts mean? What does the ring alert sound for and how about the other sound?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Hi Jared, Nothing wrong, your data is better than mine no doubt. Thanks for sharing your test results. Khalil

--- 帖子 #640 ---
The nice sound indicates a bullish impulse, the devil sound indicates a bearish impulse. If you hear these sounds very often, you might need to increase the speed threshold.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Just prepare the charts to trade during LO hours with these settings. Attached Image (click to enlarge) StOoOk

I put last EA N4S_06 on chart but no trade open. (edit: trades have opened now) The numbers gave good confirmation the time when market opened with eu. I will test it further. unfortunately the number printed Sunday are gone when I opened now mt4 again. An option to keep history may be helpful? great job, keep going note: please change sound for the green alert. I have many other signals all with the same sound.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
because we can not back test with ticks I try to speed up the learning process in smaller TF. first trade on m5, higher TF m15 and h1, SL5 TP15 smaller TF, more trades, faster learning how it works. Anyway I prefer scalps

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Do you prefer to work with version 05 ? I see it have more options then 06

--- 帖子 #645 ---
you could make it dynamic to compare asia with london session with ATR. for example not fix SL+TP but a multiplier of ATR. As well you can tell speed is 25% of atr (didnt tested numbers or periode) instead of a fix 20 points. this will also compare different pairs.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Great work here, fellas! But when I load the indicator on my chart it shows a sad smiley and no numbers underneath the candles. What to do to turn that frown upside down? Would love to try this out! Thanks a bunch and signing out. — Newbie the N00b.

Hello to all! This is a really great thread, keep it up!! @ThirdConfig Check here the basic instructions to setup an EA on MT4: https://sites.google.com/site/market...r-live-trading

tested EA v06 today on 4 pairs m5, not bad so http://prntscr.com/7pvjx2 http://prntscr.com/7pvl6v

--- 帖子 #649 ---
what is your settings on each pairs, default?

--- 帖子 #650 ---
just default settings. for gj i took 30 speed. when i see to many numbers make bigger speed so pair move faster. for a slow pair maybe speed slower. i even tried us30, gold, jp225 but not with EA. look the atr how much it is and compare. Now around London close is more flat market then EA is losing. I let it running, its only demo so i see what it does. http://prntscr.com/7py34u shorts get stopped out in later hours

--- 帖子 #651 ---
gratulations to your coding skills To run the EA do I need to plot any indicator in the chart? As I understood n4s_indy_01 needs to be in the indicator folder.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
N4S_06 EA uses N4S_Histogram indicator. The N4S_Histogram indicator will use the inputs from the EA.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Until now I couldn't see stability in EA performance, specially on lower time frames, as it gets many false signals. So my recommendation is to use it with caution. Or just use it as an indicator with your other tools for entry and exit. I promise that once I find a reliable way of using the system as an EA, I will post it here. Regards

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hello Abokwaik, What are use HTF impulse and use HTF bar direction in the parameters? Have you tried to add a filter as RSI/stochastick as a filter for overbought and oversold? great job Thank you S

--- 帖子 #655 ---
maybe you are right about the lower TF. i started EA in the morning and it did not recognize the trend reversal. So it continually got stopped out. http://prntscr.com/7qm3kn When there is a trend it does the job well. I will see if it will make it up again until end of the day. I had to restart the computer for a antivirus installation. Can the EA keep the history or how is it if it is started new without tick history. N4S_Histogram cant give data? possible idea: I see often it pull a short right into support and get then stopped out on a retrace, this repeat until support get broken or not. If you can add a code with zigzag to check possible SR and pull the trigger for order not immediate but on a retrace?

--- 帖子 #656 ---
sorry, quick question. settings is SL and TP 10 pip (100point) why EA play TP 31 pip and SL 17 pip? http://prntscr.com/7qn8il

--- 帖子 #657 ---
hi. I'm just started testing this EA and it has opened 3 orders with the same pair? https://www.mql5.com/en/charts/36887...5-gkfx-fx-cfds is this normal? I couldn't see the option off amending trade numbers in the settings, can you please highlight this, I will be nice to have number of trades that option included in the EA cheers

--- 帖子 #658 ---
do not use the EA on live account, it is not ready for that. especially if you are new to forex (are you?)

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hi Bernhard. I have blown couple accounts, so i'm not that new. lol I have been observing the EA this afternoon and I don't think the EA works well on 1min or 5min, however the result seems good on the 15min time frame. I would like the EA to only trigger one trade at time and it should switch off trading once the desired daily profit has been achieved. if brother abokwaik look into coding these features in, then it would be great.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
version 05 have the option in settings "maximum pair orders". version 06 does trade only 1 order. entry is after candle close so the shorter the TF the more entries. abokwaik already said he prefer higher tf

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Okay. I must have missed that out. I have been using version 5. I will definitely looking into this. Thanks for clarifying this. Cheers

--- 帖子 #662 ---
It will be interesting to see how the ea performances during a ranging day. Today was good, I wish it was real account rather than demo :-)

Hello guys. Very interesting thread developing. I want to test the automatic trading function (simply because I want to watch it operate and I am not always at my desk) so I can get a better idea of how this system works. I have attached it to 3 charts with the following settings from the image and enabled automatic trading. I have not received any trades yet but I want to make sure that I have the correct settings in place. This is a test so I dont care about loss hence the higher lot size. I also am not sure what to put for the times so that it is on 24 hours, so that is probably wrong as well. Any tips are greatly appreciated guys/gals. I want to try this method trading manually but ill be watching it automated for now.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
hey cardman I saw over last days that if the indicator is in agreement with other technical it give good MANUAL trades . I was also testing the EA in 4 versions over some days but must say something is wrong how the EA trade. I believe n4s signal is instant information, there is no need to look back 1h or 4h. Same as volume is instant and no lagging information no need to look back it should be instantly traded in that direction and SL TP in terms of TF and candle size were it happened, SR. The EA keep to long old information in memory what cause bad trades which repeatedly get stopped out. When abokwaik is back I have some ideas.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Thank you for the reply Bernhard. What indicators do you use to confirm a trade? (the "other technical" as you put it) I believe this has some good potential. Slightly reminds me of arbitrage systems. They work differently but I can picture a relation as arbitrage looks for a difference in price feeds, usually the faster the spike, the easier the EA can catch the movement. Can something such as this be implemented? And as far as my settings go, are they fine for the EA to actually take trades? so far I have not gotten any taken by the EA but have not been running long enough.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Thank you abokwaik for sharing the idea with us and Bernhard for the results you've seen. Putting the minicharts on the page and looking for NFS in the direction of the trend of higher time frames may have some possibilities:

--- 帖子 #671 ---
ending hour must be bigger, so 24

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Salam brother Khalil, You have done a brilliant job here. Thanks for that. One thing to know is... does the indicator n4s_indy_01 count the power of individual impulses like EA version 05/06? Thanks &amp; regards.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Thank you Bernhard.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
props to the author if he is a successful consistent daytrader. you have to very very very highly accurate to be able to be a daytrader. most successful traders probably look at longer term entries

for HTF filters check post # 309 as for RSI/Stoch filters they are on my To Do List

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Yes. There is an input parameter for Max Pair Orders (Default is 3), set to 1 if you want 1 order by pair.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
As I remember, In version 6, TP is calculated based on Reward-to-Risk Ratio. I will check the details and come back to you on this, as I don't have the source file now.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hi Bernhard, I am back and listening

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Thanks. Higher Time Frames are already included in the EA. I might add them also in the indicator if you see it necessary.

heya abokwaik I just saw you are back, welcome back how have your test results been over this time?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
This makes me thinking.....

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I like read volume its not lagging and can show instant reversal specially if its on SD SR or pivot or fib 50/68.2. I like an option to deactivate all higher TF in the EA. I think it is not needed here or even can do damage. The last bear signal was counter trend (see above) Pound was very bullish until then. (have sent you a pm before your holidays)

had you any results with my modified EA?

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Sorry Bernhard, I really haven't got the chance to try. Many things to do and my time is becoming very limited. I checked you're code and its seems that you : 1. disabled the higher tf filtration, which might work for quick scalping, but dangerous on longer term. The same effect can be done by setting higher tf parameters to the same chart tf. 2. added another filter on bull/bear difference. Which is already handled using the power ratio. Have you tested it for a reasonable number of trades ?

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I haven't spend much time testing, as I was involved in other issues. I will have to leave the testing and finding best settings for you guys while posting some new systems/robots very soon, either in Robots Lab thread, or in new threads .

Hello, I'm new here, just having a look through the threads, thought this system was pretty interesting. Have you tried Stochastic filtering at all?

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hello Abokwaik, I still have the indicator N4S_Histogram.ex4 on charts. I request a modification of the alert. I experiment with much smaller speed settings and like the alert at a minimum number of bear/bull signals with a message including the pair (not every bull/bear). I have it on 5-8 charts and like for example a alert with popup including the pair when 10 bear or bulls are printed. Alternative you could post the mq4 then I will try to include this. 2nd point, I don't know if it is possible to safe the history and don't lose it when TF is changed. regards Bernhard

--- 帖子 #716 ---
traders most always crosscheck time frame before entry. It would give much value to the indicator if the history would be saved. Alternative example is here a volatility indicator, it save the history. unfortunately it seems not to show bull and bear separated as your n4s does. http://www.icefx.eu/velocitymeter/

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hi Bernhard, Didn't I post the MQL file ?! seems not, actually I couldn't find it on my PC at work either. Most probably I developed it at home. The first request is easy and straight forward. The second request regarding history saving, and of course retrieving and populating is not straight forward. I didn't do it before, I think I can but it needs some time. Sorry for the late reply. All the best.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Here you go Bernhard, This version of N4S_Histogram has an option for min Bull or Bear count to fire the alert showing pair name. Best Regards,

I got all alerts started with the higher number. with exceeds count=10 it was alerted 10 11 12 13... this is again to much. can we agree for multiple numbers (if count=10 alert 10 20 30...) edit: to keep it simple, only 1 alert per candle (btw spelling is exceed) thanks again! @ kinitex: I use it as additional signal for my trading system. It confirms short term move m1 m5 very nicely. Ignore small counts.

The idea of trading relating to spikes is not new and ea's have been made wich allways performed well in backtests but due to the spread , slippage and brokers ,on real accounts didn't work. Anyway spreads lowered on some brokers so i think the N4indies are a valid measurement instrument for skalperz.

hello Abokwaik, How do you use the indicator? I follow this day in oil and euro. It is just follow the big candles with the highest number?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi guys I need some help, none of the indicators, not the manual NS indy nor the histogram indy show up on my charts. A new window does open underneath but it is empty. What is going on?? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #745 ---
For the indicator in the new field you have to wait until it appears. And that could take a while. It's just how that indicator works. D.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hello everybody, i don´t know if this thread is still alive? I have a question to the N4S Indy-01 Indicator. The Indicator is running on two different accunts and shows in the same Pair different Signals. Knows someone if there is a issue with the refreshing of the Indicator?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Its a live ! N4S family relies on Timers not Ticks, so if the indicator started at different accounts at different times (even with milliseconds difference) it might show different results. Also you need to ignore the first signal after attaching the indicator to a chart. Simply switch to another time frame and re-switch to the previous time frame and the indicator will reset the values. N4S Settings will highly affect how to trade it. Specially the settings related to Speed Threshold and Time, which are different for each pair depending on its volatility.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi Abokwaik, thanks for your quick reply. I knew aleady about the resetting of the values but i´m skeptical. As you know from my PM a few days ago, i would like to use the Indy as a Filter for an EA. It´s a currency strength Dashboard which shall trade the weakest or strongest currency but only if there is a Signal from the N4S Indy (all TF green or red/ above threshold) as confirmation. Would you say that could work?? or is there a possibility that you implement the Dashboard in your EA? Btw thanks again for the modification you did for me on the N4S Indy

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Hi Abokwaik, i checked it again and after 1 hour of running the Indy shows on two accounts different signals. Both where refreshed at the same time. The Ea (N4S 05) shows in both accounts the same Signals in both pairs even after hours of running???

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hi Khalil, Very very interesting indy's and comments in here. Have you ever thought of combining these indy's with a renko chart/strat? I'm going to head up to the roof and turn on the Mathtrader-signal!

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hi Abokwaik, if you don´t mind, i have just one further question. Are there differences in the calculation between the N4S Indy and the N4S Histogram Indicator or is it just a different look? Thanks in advance for your reply

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Can anyone help me, I've got N4S-05 EA on my chart but I cannot get the on chart numbers to appear on currency pairs. However they do appear on Equity index charts eg JPN225.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Versions prior to 5 use i mpulse count only , while versions 5 and above use impulse power, as explained in post#300 , post#435 and post#545 .

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Try reducing the speed.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
just to be sure: N4S Indy (the indicator version) without impulse power N4S Histogram Indicator with impulse power, right?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
As I mentioned earlier in the thread, my recommendation and this is how I am using need4speed: - I use version 5 EA (latest one) source posted here . I disable live trading. (too lazy now to make an indicator , but I will). - I set the speed suitable for each pair I trade (for example 20 for EU and GU, 35 for Gold). - I watch for consecutive sound signals (as I work on other issues and don't watch the charts), consecutive here means multiple signals in a short time (one minute). - when that happens I know there is volatility in the market, I look at the chart, if those signals align with s/r, fibo, RN, TL ... etc. I consider taking the signal on the best price I can (I usually split the trade into 2 to 5 positions, with unified SL, and different TP levels). So basically I use it to draw my attention, rest is manual.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Yes. Correct.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Thanks, worked a treat. May I add, this is s very exciting piece of work. I'll add my comments, for what they'll be worth, as I get into testing it. Many many thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi Abokwaik, i've read your thread...and i am highly interested in trying out your latest N4S_5 system...i've been trading about a year now with some success...so i consider myself a beginner...question..do you have a user guide i could use to get up and running fast...or maybe one of your followers in this thread that's having success with this could lend a hand.... thanks in advance for any help, and for sharing your system with everyone in this thread...sounds like you wear many hats in this life...so i understand you're a busy man...and you'll reply back to this when you can

--- 帖子 #765 ---
The trade was taken on open of current candle, right after the close of the previous candle which was bullish in candles color and candle power.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
They appear on bullish or bearish impulses that exceed the speed settings. Try to reduce the speed input in order to test. Must be a 5-digit broker.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
OK, abokwaik, now I understand it. The trade starts on the next candle opening.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Hows everyone doing trading this indicator?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Can any one help? I've been running various versions of N4S for a while on quite a number of pairs. I am fully aware that many pairs require different speed settings to get the best quality signal. To save me a lot of trial and error, not to mention time, can anyone list what they believe are the best speed settings for different pairs? Appreciate any guidance.

Hi AB Is there any way I can pause trading without affecting the previously loaded impulse counts?

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Here are a few suggestions for the ea: 1. If a new bar closes that has the opposite signal of the trade close the trade in the other direction. 2. If a new bar closes that has a signal in the same direction as the trade have option to increase tp or add extra lot. 3. Find way to calculated the best tp based on volume or average bar range? 4. Plot the moving average of the bulls and bears on separate window with user input for ma length.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Keep trying to make some time to test this system. I have to read more of the thread, but quick question: When measuring the speed, I presume that done off of the bid? I have been giving this some thought from a scalping perspective, and it might make better sense to measure off of the middle of the bid/ask. If the bid drops quickly, you might get a signal. However, the ask might have raised just as much as the bid dropped, so price basically went nowhere (the spread just jumped). Likewise, the bid might be stagnant, whereas the ask is really jumping, such that you get no signal when one should occur. Maybe this was already discussed in the thread -- sorry if it was and I missed it. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
No, Mid Price (bid+ask)/2 was not discussed, and I agree it would make a difference in scalping.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Can you add a trail function in "contra" version pls?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Does anyone still trad this system if so is there any updates would like to try it on demo thanks

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I want to try it live for a few days within the next week. Please, direct me to the latest updates and everything needed to get the ball rolling ie; EA, indicators, sets, etc. I've missed out on a lot of your work. It feels good to be back here again! And trying new ideas. Also, which do you feel is your best scalper to date? As far as consistency is concerned.... I will report back with live results per your best recommendations ALL live. I'm willing to risk set amount. Thanks in advance Sir, Abokwaik..

Hi Khalil, N4S_05 works very good for me as an indicator. Thank you. Please tell me how to auto refresh Max Bulls and Max Bears on a new shift/bar in any time frame it opened?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
If I download the latest version N4S do I have to download an indicator as well?

--- 帖子 #780 ---
No one is talking about auto trading with version 6. I could use a little help here. It has half the settings as previous versions so I can't adjust the settings. Should I just switch to version 5? A little support is all I ask. Thank you all in advance.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
I'm new to everything here but want to contribute a bit. As I swim through the thread, I could not find Histogram version of N4S05 with the new rules. I dig some code and here the result. There's big difference compare to prior histogram version.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
N4S_05 is not he latest version,why do u recommend this?

--- 帖子 #783 ---
As for manual trade, I see N4S05 is more interesting. N4S06 is for auto I think. I've been watching it for some days. It is a good tool to me and a great tool to somebody. The way you use it makes difference. I don't recommend any version because each one has its edge. Just try and see it yourself!

Thanks. Yes I do.

Alright; will test it and post results

--- 帖子 #790 ---
After reading all the pages here and found interesting , but backtesting doesnt give a positive results. Khalil could you please have a look on it and make some changes it to profitable please. Thanking for all your efforts.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I find this thread very intriguing. I had a similar idea. I'd like to contribute as well! 1) There are too many attachments. Which is the latest version? 2) Why doesn't the backtest work on N4S_06.ex4? Kind regards, Aqwerk

--- 帖子 #792 ---
See post#26 regarding back test. See post#756 regarding stable version. Thanks for dropping by

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Thanks for your response. Do you have Skype, Discord, anything? I have some ideas that could probably contribute to progress and stability.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
I believe this thread deserves a second look, and I will as soon as possible. meanwhile Drive Safely,

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Let's do that in public so that everyone can benefit.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
This does indeed. It's not impossible for a successful EA. With this speed idea, now all we need is a strategy in which it should measure the speed, or work during that time. To mitigate, a disciplined strategy that enters on only favourable trades. Winners over losers, overtime it could really make sense. Putting odds in our favour as much as possible. 1 winner is all you might really need in a day, but it shouldn't be luck at all, but achieved through technical filter, and after as little losses, however not yielding into loss, our motive as main. I'm testing it this week with a strategy filter. Let's see what it gets us.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Correct. I recommend N4S_05 (latest update) to be used as an informative indicator (disable auto trading in expert properties). N4S_06 was an attempt to automate using an indicator to hold the data, however, the indicator data lose its reliability on any refresh or restart of MT4 as tick data is not saved in MT4. I hope time comes and we have an MT5 version which saves tick data.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
from a PM " 1) When an impulse 'alert' is sent? How is it sent? What analysis? 2) In this post of yours ( https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...3&amp;d=1462290476 ), I can see the labels: MxBulls, CrSpeed, MxBears. Before it was: Bull, Speed, Bear. What's the difference? 3) The 'speed', how is it measured? And how does 'time' works with it? Please clear this out for me, I have some really interesting and stable ideas to implement in with this 'concept', but before all that I have to be thorough with its 'working'. " Combined Answer: an impulse is a quick push up/down in the price. Speed = (number of points moved)/(Time in seconds) a move is considered an impulse when it exceeds a certain threshold Example: settings : Speed Threshold 20 points, Time 1 second depending on the market volatility multiple ticks are received within each second (MT4 is known for its latency, I am sure we can get better implementations on other platforms Ninja, cTrader, MT5 .. etc) if price moves up 8 points in 1 second --&gt; no impulse (now max bull is 8) if price moves up 27 points in 1 second --&gt; 1 bull impulse (now max bull is 27) if price moves down 42 points in 1 second --&gt; 2 bear impulses (now max bear is 42) ...

--- 帖子 #799 ---
is there anyway to keep the impulses on the chart after its refreshed?

[quote = abokwaik; 8906665] GBPUSD H1 Indicación temprana de la caída ... usando N4S {imagen} [/ quote] I have installed the indicator n4speed histogram02 but I do not get the same as in your screenshot I have to activate something or do something in particular for this indicator that you have attached? Thank you a greeting

If someone knows how to solve it, could they tell me what my mistake is? thanks

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi John, Based on your settings (same as the default settings), Speed Setting is 20 PPS (20 Points Per Second), Signals will show when price moves UP or Down 20 points in 1 second. At the time of your post, I think London session was closed, and most probably you will not get any signals during these calm hours form this GPBUSD. For the sake of testing, you can change the indicator setting to a lower speed (say 5 PPS instead of 20 PPS), and then you will get signals, but of course they will not be as reliable as 20 PPS (for GBPUSD). Enjoy the evening, AK

--- 帖子 #283 ---
after changing the settings to 5 pps, I had few signals after a while. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
thanks for the reply A question could not be made an indicator of n4s_05? I say it to be able to do backtest I just arrived and I have some results but they do not come out if you have the computer turned off? just slen if you have the computer turned on right? Thank you

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Backtesting is not possible because EA uses ticks and the lowest you can go for back testing is M1.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I would love an MT5 version automated is this something you have found the time to make?
