Wellcome FXtrader!

Be aware some points, please before beginning to read the TCT trading system below.

Radical acceptance is a key mental strategy for coping with market  uncertainty. Many traders make the mistake of thinking they can control  the markets. Nobody can control the markets. We must learn to accept  anything that comes our way and to trade accordingly. Adopt the attitude  that trading is a journey and that all we can do is go where the  markets take us. Another thing you can do is to make sure you have a life. Trading can  be addictive especially when you are winning. Do not put all your  emotional eggs in the trading basket. You need to have other roles that  give your life meaning and purpose. By defining your identity in a  variety of ways, you will not place un-natural importance on trading  events. Therefore, you will be able to take losses in stride and look at  your trading more objectively. Might be better also, to accept your limitations and work around them, ...and become a winning trader.  Possibly, write out your trading plan with precise entry and exit points and as well  important, test your system on paper and when confident test in real time with the  minimum contract size. You will have losing trades, accept them with  grace and go on to the next trade.
So you need to make sure  your trading system fits your  trading personality; otherwise you will  find it hard to follow it.  Every trader has different needs and goals,  thus there is no system  that perfectly fits all traders. You need to  make your own research on  various trading styles and technical  indicators until you find a  concept that perfectly works for you. Make  sure you know the nature of  whatever technical indicator used.

May be Time Cell Trading   could something for you by finding several trading systems or  strategies  that suits your life - not the other way around!

Now let us speak the topic.

Time Cell Trading (TCT) is a manual trading  strategy. Trades could be triggered within different time frames and can  used in ranging and in trending markets. TCT has used since 2004. You can use Time Cell Trading strategy only by using the CCI(14) tops and bottoms in combination with the price action (e.g. engulfing patterns, hammers, shooting stars, in bars). It's simple and efficient! If you will get other arguments more, so look at the extreme points at murrey math or/and at the pivotal points. The EMA lines will show you apart from price action momentum and if there is either a trending environment or a ranging market.

So let's show you the indicators and then a few examples (see "Trade Examples").

Indicators
- CCI (14)* & RSI (14)
- Murrey Math*
- Pivot Points*
- Bollinger Band
- EMA 10 (9), 20, 50 (55), 100 (120), 200

Optional: Price action*, trendlines*, Fibonacci

*Preferred Indicators

Also I have some simple exponential moving averages e.g. EMA10 & EMA20  to give me clues on the strength of a trend  and the likelihood of mass  traders entry, also an EMA 200 as a long  term moving s/r.

Currencies: all (& commodities)

Market Tip*: In Forex we don't have the burdon of financial statements by itself. However, we can still analyze a currency's condition (strength or weakness) based on a number of factors. Combined, these give us a better indication of a particular trade's worthiness. If you insist upon predicting future movement (and I wish you wouldn't), you should be familiar with a minimum: (1) The currency's behavioral characteristics, say how much does it move (hourly?, daily?, weekly?), does it moves abruptly?, graduelly?, does it spike?; then (2) the economies of the currency pairs (strong?, weak?, budget deficits or surplius?); (3) The general market trend (up, still, down); (4) where the current market price is relative to today's movement, yesterday's-, last week's-, last month's-; (5) how do the microcharts (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1) relates to the macro- (4h, daily, weekly, monthly); and so on. Market  Tip to connoted as trade examples - these are trades how  I would like  to realise it in the given market situation so to say a  display windows  of some of my trades.

EURJPY, M1

EURJPY, M1

Sell & Buy Signals:

Sell at CCI (14) peaks over 200 or at the RSI tops and buy at valleys under 200 closed by pivot points or murrey math lines.

Minus:

M1 trading will give you a lot of false signals, so may be it's better to favorite more a global look, e.g. at M5 and M15 when scalping at M1.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
EURJPY, M5

Divergence:

Look at the CCI (14) divergence between 12:30 and 12:55 (GMT +1) and  sell at the descending peak, where the candle hits the EMA 100 (Point  2).

Preferred trades:

(1) Enter Long, (2) Exit & Enter Short, (3) Exit & Enter Long, (4) Exit

Range trading:

18:15 - 22:55 (GMT +1): rangebound trading (upper and bottom line at  Bollinger Band) by taking the entries and exits at M1.

Point 5-12 has pointed out the range bound trading, when switching at M15/M30/H1 you could see often indifferent candles.

Preffered trades:

(5) Enter Long, (6) Exit & Enter Short, (7) Exit 6 Enter Long, (8)  Exit & Enet Short, (9) Exit & Enter Long, (10) Exit & Enter  Short, (11) Exit & Enter Long, (12) Exit.

These trades should be executed at M1 with regard at M5.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
EURJPY, M15

As long as EMA lines 10, 20, (may be 50) are running side by side let your win run.

Focus at CCI (14) peaks and valleys in conjunction with Pivots and/or Murrey Math lines and/or EMA lines - the more the merrier.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
EURJPY, H4

Focus at the H4 support line at the ascending price pathway and buy at  the pullbacks (together at the bottom line of the bollinger band)

July 12 4:00 - July 20 12:00 (GMT+1): H4 moves in a range at parallell running Ema lines. Trade M1, M5, M15.

Murrey Math.

Description: This indicator shows pivot point, oversold,  overbought and extreme levels on your MT4 charts.

[-2/8] P extremely overshoot

[-1/8 ] P overshoot

[0/8] PUltimate Support - extremely oversold

[1/8] PWeak, Stall and Reverse

l[2/8 ] PPivot, Reverse - major

[3/8] PBottom of Trading Range

[4/8] PMajor Support/Resistance Pivotal Point

[5/8] PTop of Trading Range - [5/8], if 10-12 bars then 40% Time. SELL  Premium Zone

[6/8] PPivot, Reverse - major

[7/8] PWeak, Stall and Reverse

l[8/8] PUltimate Resistance - extremely overbought

[+1/8] Povershoot

[+2/8] Pextremely overshoot

murrey math

1. Line 8/8 & 0/8  (Ultimate Support and Ultimate Resistance).

Those lines are the most strong concerning Support and resistance.

2. Line 7/8 (Weak, Place to Stop and Reverse).

This line is weak. If suddenly the price was going too fast and too far    and stops around this line it means the price will reverse down very    soon. If the price did not stop near this line this price will continue    the movement to the line 8/8.

3. Line 1/8 (Weak, Place to Stop and Reverse).

This line is weak. If suddenly the price was going too fast and too far    and stops around this line it means the price will reverse up very   soon.  If the price did not stop near this line this price will continue   the  movement down to the line 0/8.

4. Line 2/8 and 6/8 (Pivot, Reverse)

Those two lines yield the line 4/8 only to the strength to reverse the  price movement.

5. Line 5/8 (Top of Trading Range)

The price is spending the about 40% of the time on the movement between    the lines 5/8 and 3/8. If the price is moving near line 5/8 and   stopping  near the line during the 10 - 12 days so it means that it is   necessary  to sell in this "bonus zone" (some people are doing like   this) but if  the price is keeping the tendency to stay above 5/8 line,   so it means  that the price will be above. But if the price is droping   below 5/8 line  it means that the price will continue falling to the   next level of  resistance.

6. Line 3/8 (Bottom of Trading Range).

If the price is below this line and in uptrend it means that it will be    very difficult for the price to break this level. If the price broke    this line during the uptrend and staying above during the 10- 12 days  it   means that the price will be above this line during the 40% of its   time  moving between this line and 5/8 line.

7. Line 4/8 (Major Support/Resistance Line).

It is the major line concerning support and resistance. This leve is the    better for the new sell or buy. It is the strong level of support of    the price is above 4/8. It is the fine resistance line if the price is    below this 4/8 line.

Trading style

TCT allows making money at all timeframes (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, Weekly).

How to use the indicators?

In shorter time frames M1, M5, M30 I like the Murrey Maths, at H4 or daily the Pivots are preferred.

CCI & RSI: Peaks & valleys are most powerful at all time frames, favored at M5, M15, H4, Daily.

Example:

Take a look at the M1, M5, M15 and H4 charts above, please.

Time cell trading:

It's easy to make pips in the downward movements with several enter  shorts at M1, M5 and M15 with coincident H4 enter long trades.

Entry and Exit with a higher probability of making a profit

Entries and Exits are most powerful when you see the tops & peaks  (CCI, RSI) near Pivotal Points and/or S & R lines, and/or Murrey  Math Lines and/or EMA Lines.

You can also take a look moreover at the candlestick formation  (engulfing patterns, umbrella lines like the hammer or the hanging man,  shooting star, harami cross [petrifying pattern], doji, falling window,  dumpling top, high-price gapping play, rising three methods, tasuki,  tower top and tower bottom, in-neck-line, pan bottom, separating lines,  night attack, thrusting line, three mountain top, box range...)

Divergence Trading with CCI

CCI(14) divergence can be often focus at M5 or M15 for the confirmation  of a trend change in conjunction with the pivotal points or Murrey Math.  Please keep in mind that I use divergence as  an indicator, not a signal to enter a trade!, like http://www.babypips.com/school/how_t...gences.htmlhad has exactly described. So you could put in an oscillator like MACD or  Stochastic as well, ...the problem is that in some case you didn't find  a MACD divergence, when you'll find one at CCI or RSI, so I pefere to  focus the CCI at M5 and M15 (and may be at M30 and higher time frames).

If you take a look at the EURJPY, M5 example #3  above, you will be aware of the regular bearish divergence exactly when  the price bar has reached at EMA100 & DS2 at 112.65 - so there were  three powerful arguments for going short, ...so this trade could have a  higher probabilitiy (likelyhood) for a profit taking.

The frame below shows the principle of divergence (here now with rsi). Be aware that it exists a hidden divergence moreover.

USDCHF, H1, 2010 August 06

Enter and Exits:

at the valleys and the peaks in conjunction with Ema, pivotal and/or murrey math lines.

TCT with USDCHF is favored at H1, H4 & Daily.

Make your experience when trading TCT which time frames could be favored for other currency pairs, e.g.: EURUSD, EURJPY, USDCAD, ...

Forex Trading is very risky and will help you to loose all your money   fast and easy. Why?...if only because 95% loose his money at forex   trading as they do what they  are doing. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...yim/crying.gifIf   you have enough money at your account and a realistical money   management and your account could be managed by patience, may be you've   got a better chance not loosing all of your money after several years  of  experience... but don't be so green and be happy if you are winning   some coins only sometimes.http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/nerd.gifMore risky settings could be focus if the market probabilities will be greater.http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/whew%21.gifThe   trading journal hasn't the intention to show investments with the   highest likelihood and highest probabilities, it will be still extent in   the jungle of the forex market with better chances for making a  profit.http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/waiting.gif   The trading decisions are completely businesslike, hardheaded,   unemotionally & pracmatical. That could be often a reason for   hedging the positions in ranging markets for several days or weeks,   dependent from the timeframe you needed.

Hi fguru

Yes of course. I have open trades which are on an average 30% - 50% when the account has account for wins (to show a profit from minimum 25%). 80% of then run in the wins sooner or later. So I have hedged several positions.

Start 15 demo accounts, on each account don't take any losing trades.

Wait for the market to come back to your entry, plus a couple pips.

After two weeks, take the account with the largest gain, perhaps the only one left. The other accounts margin called or busted or flat.

Post that in a thread with some very vague "system" description.

Magic! Your system is fantastic! You're up +400%.

You forget to mention the other 14 margin called accounts which are down a total of net -1000%.

I'm not saying that is what Forexcube is doing. But you could get similar results that way.

Perhaps you could start a fresh account that we could see from the beginning and keep it going for a couple months?

I'm very interested in your system and results.

Thanks and good luck.

P.S. The equity on this demo account is at 48% of balance value at this moment, could you "unlock" the Open Trades section and let us see how many losing trades you are holding at the moment? Potentially, depending on size of those positions you could be margin-called by Monday or Tuesday if you've been shorting the EUR/USD?

Sorry Intu

I have a complete other money management. If I have doubling one account I transfer all this money to my private account and start again. So I do it with the Demo's too. Then 50% of the wins of every old account will transfer to the new account. Why?,...due to the fact that two or three days in a year market moves extremly At these phase traders lost much/most of his money. Be aware of these market turmoil which coming up completely unexpected. Keep the odd money!

and look at this what brokers are writing when opening a real account.

"When trading online, you should be aware that during periods of high  internet traffic, you might experience delays in accessing account data  due to systems capacity limitations. Additionally, system response times  may be adversely affected by increased market volatility conditions,  quote delays, system performance; and other factors outside of our  control, which may include your computer system and internet service  provider. You may also experience system outages or delays as a result  of, among other things, power failures, programming failures or heavy  trading volume. During periods of increased volatility, you might suffer  market losses in the price and lot size of a particular pair when  systems problems result in an inability to place buy or sell orders. The  risk of financial loss in trading online can be substantial; therefore,  you should consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light  of your circumstances and financial resources."

Isn't absolutely true. What's your intention?

Ladies and gentlemen, after reading with some amusement a few of the purported "trading systems" discussed on this forum, a thought occurred to me.

If I developed a sure fire trading system that won 90-95% of the time, not only wouldn't I discuss it on a forum, I would lock it into the deepest vault I could find and never, ever disclose it to anyone. I would use it to make tons of money.

Can one of the wise men or wise ladies on the forum explain to me why anyone would share a winning trading system with others?

This is a serious question, because something doesn't make sense.

Otherwise, this is a great forum.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
48%from +443% profit  is much more then over 100% profit from 25'000.-$, say more then 60'000.-$ net!

Why not? You dont want to see other people earning money? If you have developed a system that wins 90-95% of the time, then be happy and make money, but why not share it with others? You wont be less successful if other people use the same system or will you?

Hi there, I know it's your thread so you can post pretty much what you want but just show us some real trades from your account history(with all the statistics) and drag them on your charts. Otherwise there is no proof of your "succsess".

BTW your "interest of quality" is pretty funny. Isn't this forum about learning and asking questions by traders who still need anwers? What makes you think that only experienced traders would be interested in your strategy? Do you measure one's trading experience in number of his/her posts?

Hi i just want to say this is a great system, it is just about the discipline of the trader. This system is not for those that like quick profit and works better on longer time frame like 1hr and 4hr. Thanks for introducing the Murreys MAths that is really something new to me, i usually just use sto and bollinger bands with candles signals for entry but as a new trader i often get impatient and take my profit too early.

But i would like to ask do u bring your stop loss to your break even? if u do when do u place your stop loss at be?

Hi neurus

In the "Market Tip" sections you'll find the main timeframe at the beginning of the comments.

e.g. CADCHF, H4, see #55, or USDCHF, H1, see  #15

Before I take a trade I make my analysis of minimum 5 timeframes for every currency pair (two higher & two lower). When I make my trading decision at H4 I enter my trades at M5 or M15, if I don't set a pending order. Basically I like to trade at all time frames with a strong look at Risk/Reward-Ratio dependently at the used timeframe.

Please don't post untrue statements.

According to this system Forexcube has taken 76 trades on 8/6/10 with an average profit of 3 pips.

(screenshot below from his Trade History)

This has nothing to do with longer time frames.

As for stop-loss, he apparently does not place them.

All his open trades are hidden, presumably with large losses in EUR/USD, that is why his equity is at 49%.

Can we see your Open Trades so as to better understand your risk?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I'm very critical of this "system" only to protect people who cannot decipher fact from "fiction."

It is dangerous because newcomers to FF can be deceived very easily.

He has asked for money before in a thread very similar to this one.

Hi daemonw

Many thanks!

My SL concept is completely unorthodox. I don't trade often with stopp loss due to the fact that often I hedge some positions if they are running into the counterpart direction and wait for a counterbalancing at higher time frames. Market will change and time will come! I prefere to let the market his breath. Often I counterbalance trades at H4 with several intermediate trades at 30 sec., M1 and M5 only for a few pips, so when market turn I make money even so and let the big trade (H4) further running, due to the fact that I believe in my market analysis.

Hi all

I only ask two questions...

Why did you start a second username recently that has been banned?

All my other published trading systems has been 4 or 5 stars since before the transfer into the commercial sector. Two weeks ago I have got my name Forexcube as "Member" back (not any more "commercial member under evaluation"). Till then I have written under trigg and at that time no comment more under forexcube and I have written a few letters to FF and have give him all my synonymes and my intention to go to the member thread back. OKAY! Right so, or something else, that you don't like ...

Again: What's your really problem!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Then you can play fair and give all here a mathematical clear solution from  #66 , please.

If an account has opened with 25'000.-$ (three weeks ago) and has now incl. open trades 443%. How much are then 49% net?

Sorry but I wouldn't respect a person who I have the intention to overrun with one critical aspect after the next & with many assumptions and not abating vague suppossitions!

Okay,..., may be it's a kind of character!... I don't know!...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
This is your thread and I have no desire to harass or argue with you.

You have over 1700 trades in three weeks with no losses.

I argue that you hold the losing trades in your Open Positions never taking a loss.

With your recent activity in EUR/USD and your current equity...

I will wager that you have accumulated positions that will margin call the account with a 200 pip upward move in Euro based currencies.
It could happen tomorrow or the next day easily.

If you show your Open Positions and I am wrong I will not post on Forex Factory for 3 months.  (painful... as I enjoy the community)

If you do in fact have large SHORT positions in Euro based currencies,
you will discontinue this thread and not post in it again.

Deal?

Unlock the Open Positions and post it here within 15 minutes?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I don't have say that I haven't open positions in the loss. What's your unfair play know. If you have 49% in the wins from 443% of initial deposits of 25'000.-$ so it's a marvellous result & this moreover after three weeks of trading and you have to respect that and to respect that I trade my way and account in the win. If you show me that I don't have a win over 100% when I exit all my open position now then you have to give me 1'000-$ which I'll make a named donation and not the bauble of 3 months away from FF. You make me here ignoble,..., now accept responsibility & raise the stakes!.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
You do it!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
What's your problem

When I trade an account in the wins and I follow a Non-Stopp-Loss-Conception in my unorthodox way, why I should discontinue this marvellous thread with this great TCT-System if other interesting traders could also earn money, may be much or even more money with his Stop Loss Conceptions? Will your ego cut them all, now! What's your real intention! Are you employed by the brokers! Then I understand your contrastive rhetoric!,...or is it only a special kind of crazy thoughts walk, today?

i am just a junior member but i just want to say, it is not like forex cube is here to con money away from us why so hostel. IF we dont trust the system just test it, it is not like he will be getting lots of money from us when u trade the time cell. Try it on the 1hr and 4 hr time frame it is a limit your losses and trail your profits kind of trading style.

Just to share a bit too i go in 3 lots at entry too, 1 to tp at mid bollinger, 2nd one at the edge of the bollinger, the third one i usually just let it run

--- 帖子 #90 ---
For interesting traders who like to test the TCT with real money, but not with much money, I have decided to make a demonstration with a real Account for several months. So I have take one of my experimental account which I will trade with the TCT-System for several months.

Trading environments

Maximum 10 Positions could be made per currency pair at the basis of 50 units, (or 5 x 100, or 2 x 250, may be 1 x 500). I prefere the 50 units when I trade with a 50.-$ Account with the exception, if probabilities seems to be extremely high for making a higher profit I take boundless freedom for increasing my own risk to a considerable degree, e.g. 10 x 100 units or several times 500 units instead of 10 x 50 units or so.

So you can follow the results of this account if you want.

HiCl3ric

It would be more respectful, if you make your charts by yourself. You have all information at p.1, #1. So for the next time I invite you to make one chart by yourself and post it here and you are able to discuss my market tip with other traders here on board. Why not! I'm not your secretair! I think I give many worthwhile directions here on board, but I demand more arrangements by the visitor.

I won't give any TP limits sometimes. So it is an extra responsibility for a trader to go out of the market when he's/she's thinking... "it's all right now!"

I let the market run and any time or one day or other I go out. I hate strictly rules and sometimes I trade only for lucky several pips.

Entry was at 1.38557 with 4 x 50 units & 1 x 100 units, see #101 ,please.

I would set at 1.398 (R3 1.3942) and murrey math "Pivot Reverse" 1.4155 by trading the H4 chart and give the market it's breath. CCI(14) show a negative divergence so the likelihood is great for a movement downside.

Generally I dont like stop loss I would hedge these positions at these points, due to the fact that long line (monthly chart) prices will going north.

1,3890? 1,3915? could be too dangerous by trading H1. Short-term-breaks could be possible at the confusing Forex Market every time, moreover after the London close session.

AUDUSD Daily gives for me probabilities to stay at the sideline and wait till the market have decide which direction it will further go. The shooting star and the divergence are arguments for a downtrend at the daily. Weekly (see  #135, please) shows a peak and the monthly is reached near the resistance line like the candles before 2009.10 01, 2010.01.01, 2010.03.01, 2010.04.01. May be 0.92772 but if it will go further on?,...even better rather strong arguments for an alternative downside movement.  So H4 EMA20 could be develop as a resistance line where market price still stay yet ( see #136, please). So long as H1 doesn't break the EMA50/100 (the last five candles shows as well slightly down) I would be careful.

This is a very easy and simple system and I love it.

Addressing your "Minus" points, one way to filter false signal out is by looking at the CCI window. It also has the RSI indicator. Taking a closer look at all the false signals in the yellow rectangles you can see that the RSI didn't close above or below the 100, -100 line. When it did, in agreement with the CCI, it gave a valid signal.

Forexcube- I see you have started a new fxbook account, will you be handling stop losses differently on it? I've been charting your charts on it and amazed how you can squeeze pips out of a flat market.

bcarbon- great insight, so obvious now that you point it out.

Hi Delage

If an account has been redoubled, tripled or quadruplicated I make another open and close the win account. So I take risk money out of the forex jungle.  The last was 25'000.-$ and has reached over 70'000.-$ net (only profit) or more within 3 weeks. Demos has often been offered for only 1 month. Now I put out 65'000.-$ and go on with 5'000.-$ so no "private" money is now at this Forex Account, only quota of profits.

I have one open with 5'000.-$ yesterday and will make the same 250.-$ per day. May be  5% a day is too much,... maybe not...

My Stop Loss concept could be the same. If the market go counterpart I will hedge these positions if it seems necessarily and wait of counterbalancing at a higher timeframe. I'm not a friend of Stop Loss and I let the losers run for a while if I have make a sufficient market analysis before. Why to give up your trades in a critical market phase when you have make a market analysis before, which you can trust?...Moreover minus trades could be counterbalanced with cross currency pairs and so on...

UJ H4 seems for me a good entry chance. The last three swings shows a divergence. Weekly chart shows murrey math between [-1/8] and [-2/8]. You could wait at the market close if a hammer is building.

Enter Long at 85.30 with 3 positions.

Further downside movements could be hedged at M5.

And take a look how EURJPY and GBPJPY works. Monthly EURJPY signalizes upward movement,... may be till 117/118 in the next weeks, we don't know when,...but I bet a coin it'll coming...

Target: 85.90 (R1 85.96) / 86.25 (MR2 86.30) / 86.50 (H4 EMA100  86.56)

I did look at H1 and M30 and their indicators are both going south. I would wait until they change directions to get a better entry signal.

Your  feedback is very much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi bcarbon,

Prices are struggling aroung M30 EMA50 (, see #158, please). If it would stay above it (EMA50) then an  upward movement could have a better probability. EMA20 at H1 could just now change in a support line, second last H1 candle (red one) is coming down to it the candle yet just now is blue and goes up. If the market price won't have the force to run it down (it has to close under EMA20) and the next H1 candle doesn't then go upwards again, then it seems for me a downward movement could have been a greater likelihood,... and sure...  e all opened enter long positions have to been hedged then.

Surely waiting is less risky...no doubt! ...may be then you are not early enough in the trade, ...the old classic melodrama.

USDJPY, H1, 2010 August 11

May be it helps.

First trade today, a sell at 84.936. Entries are the checks, exit the X. I took this about the top of the trading channel with CCI at 100 and RSI at 75. PA continued up and took another sell at 84.983 with CCI at 200 and RSI at 100, much better position. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the first trade as it didn't meet my rules of a short at 200 and RSI at 100. The reason is because the trading channel at that time was bouncing between 84.90 and 84.95 with the CCI between 100 and -100. That's a very narrow channel and should be avoided by a beginner, although Forexcube does it frequently.Exit was at the bottom of the trading channel and CCI at -100. Lesson: Both were profitable but stick with higher probability trades, like the second.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Ouch! No fun here but a lesson. Shorts at 84.927 and 84.954 with CCI and RSI way up there should have been profitable and would have been if my trigger finger had been faster when CCI plunged to -150. This is a great illustration of sideways PA and positive divergence which will lead to an upupupwards PA. Lesson: Watch divergence, it's there for a reason.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I'm throwing this out for discussion - CCI and RSI were 100 points apart for a while, then PA snapped up. With RSI on top and that far apart, is that a leading indicator of a quick move up?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
On the right where PA hits -2/8 extreme overshoot line, the CCI is only at -100 and RSI is a little below zero. I don't think with the CCI and RSI in those positions I would have taken the trade, they're not in a tradeable position. But look how the PA shot up. Earlier PA had gone down almost to -2/8 and CCI and RSI were in an excellent positions for a long, which would have done very well. But the second time PA shot farther, can't make sense of that.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is how I look at it. CCI and PA are showing a big divergence. That alone is a big signal, even if CCI is not quite yet at -100. PA is almost touching Extremely- overshot level. The two candles in question formed a double bottom and the blue candle has a bullish candle pattern. This candles are also touching the lower BB. As for RSI I favor when it either crosses or touches the 20 level. In this case, I cannot see that level marked in the chart, but at this point there are so many other signals giving a green light for a long position that it really doesn't matter.

(3)...and...beware of the M15, M30, H1 main downtrend, which has dominated ...may be only too well for advanced level traders,...to trade counter the main trend...and even it's better when trading M1 looking at M5 and M15 and for the big overview M30 / H1.

i ve been trading murray math lines lately with profit.  martingaling at extreme oversold and overbought levels.  making profit.   when one postion is a nice profit, my discretion i get out of position and reset a limit order.  i use a very small % of account size just in case it really goes bad.  thats the martingale.

keep in mind that mm lines redraws at some point.

May be that Alpari would delete this Demo Account account (Deposit 5'000.-$) without saying me anything, due to the fact that I haven't fill out all personal dates in his fields. So they let you trade and at one they go without warning and Alpari UK delete your account. With the first one (Deposit 25'000.-$ and in the win over 80'000.-$ which was sometimes over 250%-350% net plus within 3 weeks they have make it in this way. If they do it with this 5'000.-$ Demo account again I'll change the Demo Broker.

forexcube can u pls explain how do you add-up to position? basically we understood entry/exits.. now how u add-up ?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi mistersimple,

you might well ask!

At first I don't go often with one big order in the market (e.g. 2 lot) to a greater degree I divided it into small parts (e.g. 10 x 0.2 or 20 x 0.1). So I can go only with a part of it faster out (of the market) and let the others running furthur on.

Second between the valley and the peaks or vice versa I make sometimes smaller trades in between.

Third: I like time cell cycling, say if H4 shows me an uptrend I go with several positions in this up. Simultaneously I trade down e.g. if M5 and/or M15 moves down with the same currency. Why not making money in different time cells with the same currency pair?

Fourth: If I trade e.g. M5 EURJPY I look at M5 GBPJPY and M5 USDJPY,... or look (other example) if I trade M5 EURJPY, to H4 USDJPY and H1 GBPJPY and like to trade (in this case now) positive correletated currencies but in counterpart direction, e.g. trade M5 EURJPY down and H4 USDJPY up. For the account it's better to counterbalance the risk.

Fifth: It market shows greater probability I go in with several higher lots sometimes but only for a few seconds or minutes.

Sixth: Sometimes I trade only for making more winning trades and only with several pips not more (30sec., M1) & if there could be a main trend so at times I go several times in and out... and in and out... it gives me excellent feelings of being in the flow and could be a great power for the mental and physical presence, may be it's more a psychophysiological moment. I don't now,..., but I like it!

Mistersimple, I think I should answer your question more detailed bit by bit in the future. If so then we should named this with a headline, so we and all here could talk about it in the future, if there should be a greater interest,...then may be under the topic: "Get-Add-up"? or "add-up-positions" or "position surfing"? and some of intersting readers would get clear what's talking about.

We all have different add-up-position-strategy dependent at different basic parameter.

May be I'll write an article (3-20 pages) some day and then it'll post here on board.

How are you making this?

Kindest regards

Oh yes, no problem, will made!

I trade often without stop loss, so what I can make is when I hedge the "A"-positions when these first entries would running in a "loss trade" ("A"-position) and can show you that often (over 80%) also these trades ("A"-positions) could run in a win at a higher timeframe.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thank's.

See p.12, #175, point 1 and point 6 please.

This is conscious perception and simple mathematical calculation. If I trade 10 x 0.2 EURUSD and it will go extremely in a counterpart direction so I hedge e.g. with 4 x 0.5 or 2 x 1.0 lot or 20 x 0.2 and look at a higher timeframe when it's time to get with several of them out. This caluculation could be made for every currency pair. So I stay on the top of things. Moreover, most of them are shorter time frames, so risk coud be higher. Other open trade have in background the winning trade from yesterday or the day before, say if my target should be 250.-$ a day so I can trade with the rest of my profit with a higher risk and due to the fact that I trust my own market analysis. One more argument for me is that I let even more some lost trades run in the lost till the point where most of them will turn back and run in a win ( I think over 80% of all of them), ...but before that I have often hedged these position for a shorter time and several times. So I like to trade an unorthodox way, which give me win enough in a relative short time. I think it's more for advanced level trader who make more successul market analysis before they get into a trade. May be a beginner level trader will copy this concept and have success,...and is aware of the formula  "( Equity > Used Margin ) = No  Margin Call". So it's necessary to understand the mechanics of margin and how to use leverage. If so I hope he/she will post his/her marvellous results then here on the board, too.

May be it's something more like that.

Kindest regards

If your broker requires 2% margin, you have a leverage of  50:1. Here  are the other popular leverage “flavors” most brokers offer:
Margin Required Maximum Leverage           5%     20:1           3%     33:1           2%     50:1           1%     100:1           .5%     200:1           .25%     400:1

Margin required: This  is an easy one because I just  talked about. It is the amount of money your  brokers requires from you  to open a position. It is expressed in percentages.
Account margin: This  is just another phrase for your trading bankroll. It’s the total amount of  money you have in your trading account.
Used margin: The  amount of money that your broker  has “locked up” to keep your current positions  open. While this money  is still yours, you can’t touch it until your broker  gives it back to  you either when you close your current positions or when you  receive a  margin call.
Usable margin: This  is the money in your account that is available to open new positions.
Margin call: If the equity in the account drops  below your used  margin, a margin call will occur and some or all open  positions will be closed  by the dealing desk at the market price.

see http://www.babypips.com/school/margin_defined.html

--- 帖子 #200 ---
No matter what the forex brokers  tell you, don’t ever open a “standard account” with just $2,000 or a  “mini  account” with $250. The number one reason new traders fail is not  because they  suck, but because they are undercapitalized from the  start and don’t understand  how leverage really works.

Don’t set yourself up to fail.

We recommend that you  have at least  have $100,000 of trading capital before opening a  “standard account”, $10,000  for a “mini account”, or $1,000 for a  “micro account”.

So if you only have  $60,000, open a  “mini account. If you only have $8,000, open a “micro”  account. If you only  have $250, open a “demo account” and stick with it  until you come up with the  additional $750, then open a “micro  account”.

It's necessary to understand when you trade in the conception of the add-up-positions...

We’ve all seen or heard online forex brokers  advertising how  they offer 200:1 leverage or 400:1 leverage. I just  want to be clear that what they  are really talking about is the maximum leverage   you can trade with. Remember this leverage ratio depends on the margin  required  by the broker. For example, if a 1% margin is required, you  have 100:1  leverage.

There is maximum leverage. And then there is your true leverage.

True leverage is the full amount of your position divided by  the amount of money deposited in your trading account.

You deposit $10,000 in your trading account. You buy 1  standard 100K  of EUR/USD at a rate of $1.0000. The full amount of your position  is  $100,000 and your account balance is $10,000. Your true leverage is 10:1   ($100,000 / $10,000)

Let’s say you buy another standard lot of EUR/USD at the same  price.  The full amount of your position is now $200,000 and your account   balance is still $10,000. Your true leverage is now 20:1 ($200,000 /  $10,000)

You’re feeling good so you buy three more standard lots of  EUR/USD,  again at the same rate. The full amount of your position is now   $500,000 and your account balance is still $10,000. Your true leverage  is now  50:1 ($500,000 / $10,000).

Assume the broker requires 1% margin. If you do the math, your  account balance and equity are both be $10,000, the Used Margin is  $5,000, and  the Usable Margin is $5,000. For one standard lot, each pip  is worth $10.
http://www.babypips.com/school/image...leverage-1.gif

In order to receive a margin call, price would have to move 100  pips ($5,000 Usable Margin divided by $50/pip).

This would mean the price of EUR/USD would have to move from 1.0000 to .9900 – a price change of 1%.

After the margin call, your account balance would be $5,000.  You lost $5,000 or 50% and the price only moved 1%.

Here's a trade so stupid I hate to post it. Not only that, but it was in the middle of several great opportunities. Previously the CCI had poped up at 50 to gain a few pips so when it stared to do it again, I entered at buy at 110.057. Went up a bit and then down, I got out for a loss on demo account. I was looking at the M5 at the same time and saw the divergence but ignored it. I should have seen the divergence, sold at CCI 200, rode PA down to -300 or so (pivot, reverse) and taken a buy when PA and CCI started to move up for two big wins. Maybe this coming week.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Here's a loser from Thursday. At that time I didn't watch the higher time frames. The next day I concentrated on one currency on M1, M5 and M15(on a second monitor) and did a lot better. On the M1 I took a short at the red vertical line which quickly turned against me. If I had been watching the M5, I could have seen PA was in the middle of an upward movement and, not only was a pullback at that point probably a limited one, but that it would be better to take a position at the top or bottom of the PA and CCI channel. Lesson: Watch higher time frames.

The chart below shows a long position in which a trader purchases a currency pair at a certain price and hopes to sell it later at a higher price. In this case, the trader profits from an increase in price.

This is also referred to as "buy low, sell high"

In forex position trading, a trader has a long position on one currency of the pair and a short position on the other currency. So, while forex position trading, a trader defines his position as an expression of the first currency of the traded pair, which is known as the base currency. The second currency is known as the counter currency.

In forex position trading, the trader takes a long position on a pair when he buys the base currency. If the trader sells the base currency, he shorts the pair.

Hi Delage

Thank's for these charts and your trading examples.

You can see the higher probabilities for the market entries here?

May be in this kind you've got even more a profit with less risk.....

What you see is that you have also a volatile M5 downward trend. EMA10 and EMA20 are running parallel. May be good time, too to trade beside the M5 the M1 only then when M5 candles are touching the upper EMA100 Line and M1 CCI(14) is showing a peak. It could be a higher risk to trade in an M5 downward trend the M1 upwards even CCI(14) will showing every time a valley, due to the fact that the main trend (here now M5) is going down. (Here you have to look at M15 & M30 too, please. If they are going up, then the likelihood a greater to trade M1 also upwards). I would suggest the M5 down and M1 up (or up and down) trading only for advanced level traders.

Hope it helps!

Keep it on!

Kindest regards

0.99540 seems for me a good entry price.

Could go down till S3 0.9914 (daily chart), weekly: 0.952 / 0.9277 / 0.8789

H1 and H4 is building a valley.

Enter long with several positions at 0.9954 and trade the hedge ones with M30/H1 for possible furhter downside movements.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
When you say several positions what would be an approximate number to that statement?

If you see that the price could go dawn more, then why  don't wait until it is there to open your trades. To be honest, I have no experience at all with hedging and prefer to stay away from it.

Changing subjects, I have been searching for an indicator that draw divergence lines between CCI and PA. So far I have found a divergence indicator for RSI and PA.  If you set RSI to 5 it almost run contiguous to CCI 14 (not exactly but it is the best I have found so far). It would be wonderful addition to have in the charts and a less thing to watch for. I know we would

have a good use for it, but still searching.

Trades could be made to maximum 10 positions. In this case I mean 3 positions.

H1 and H4 has building a CCI(14) valley, so I go in at H1 and H4 with enter long.

Daily or weekly chart could lead you further downside. But at Time Cell Trading trades could be made at different time frames with the same currency pair.

(May be M5 or M15 will show me a peak at CCI(14) and then I decide to go short for several positions at M5 and/or M15).

To be honest, since late last week I have spent most of my time searching for the right indicator rather than trading. There are thousands of indicators to try and very little time, so I cannot tell you how they work in different time frames because I have not tried them yet .

However few months ago I used  a very successful system in M5 that used RSI but it did stop to work for whatever reason.

Nevertheless, here is the chart with some interesting RSI indicators. Not exactly what I want.

AUDCAD, H1 Trade Example & Add-Up positions

Buy and sell when CCI(14) is at the extreme levels at the murrey math. lines.

Preferred Trade: P1 (Enter Short), P2 (Exit)

Trades in between times: P3 (Enter Long), P4 (Exit & Enter Short), P5 (Enter Short again), P2 (Exit all)

Add-up positions

If you would trade normally with 0.1 Lot so divide it by 10 and split 0.01 x 10, if  you trade regularly with 1 Lot per trade so you should divide by 10 and partition  0.1 x 10. So the trades could often be made with a maximum of 10 incremental positions (IP's) of 1 Lot or 0.1 lot or whatever you pay for your average trade.

Example: P1 enter short with 3 positions till P2 and exit here. P3 enter long with 2 positions and exit at P3. At P3 enter short with 2 positions again, P5 enter short with 2 positions once more,... and exit all positions at P2.

Maximum incremental positions which has been used in this example: 7 IP's (incremental positions) in a downward market movement from P1 till P2.

Got into the first a bit early at 1.28600 with CCI at -200 and RSI at -75 and MM line 1/8. PA continued down so got out; I was a bit worried about the downward movement of the CCI on the M15, Thought there might be a trend change. Lose of - 17.7 pips. A few minutes later PA when to -1/8 and CCI and RSI were moving up so another buy at 1.28447, which I rode up until PA got soft and I got out for 24 pips. I noticed that sometimes PA will continue down after CCI hits bottom and then turns up, that happened here.

see e.g. http://fxpath.com/2010/05/31/forextr...thdivergences/

Learn Forex (FXpath.com)  – Price-oscillator divergences in the forex market are instances when  there is a technical imbalance between the price movement on a currency  pair and an oscillator’s movement. Divergences should not be considered  complete, self-contained trading strategies. Rather, they should be  regarded as signals that warn of some potential impending directional  bias. As such, divergences are not standalone indicators – they should  confirm or be confirmed by other technical indications.

The oscillator that is used to identify divergences can be any of a  number of different chart studies that can be found on any forex  charting platform. These include: Stochastics, Relative Strength Index  (RSI), Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), MACD Histogram,  Rate of Change (ROC), Momentum, Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Williams  %R, or any other oscillator that travels between defined horizontal  bounds.

Once an oscillator is chosen, the process of searching for  divergences is straightforward. There are two types of divergence that  every technical forex trader should be aware of: regular divergence and  hidden divergence.
Regular divergence is the most popular type, and it is what most  traders mean when they refer to the general concept of divergence.  Regular divergence serves as an early potential signal that a loss of  momentum and a potential price reversal may be in the making.

The signal is manifested in an uptrend when price makes a higher high  while the oscillator makes a lower high. This is called bearish regular  divergence, and warns of a potential reversal and possible subsequent  move to the downside. The opposite is called bullish regular divergence  and occurs during downtrends. In a bullish divergence, price makes a  lower low while the oscillator makes a higher low. In both cases,  bearish and bullish, the oscillator diverges from price, giving an  indication that price momentum in the currently prevailing direction may  be waning.

If either type of regular divergence is identified on a currency  chart, forex traders should immediately seek confirmation of a potential  reversal before taking any trading action. This confirmation can take  many forms, and usually involves other technical indications like a  trendline or moving average break, a reversal candle pattern, or some  other chart reversal pattern.

In contrast to regular divergence, the second type of divergence,  called hidden divergence, can be considered the polar opposite. This  signal is also a technical imbalance between price movement and  oscillator movement. But instead of signaling a potential reversal,  hidden divergence is used primarily to signal a potential continuation  in the prevailing trend. As with regular divergence, there are also two  basic manifestations of hidden divergence.
Bearish hidden divergence usually occurs during a downtrend, and is  characterized by price making a lower high while the oscillator makes a  higher high. In this case, price and the oscillator are diverging in  their signals, but the overriding signal that should be taken from an  occurrence of bearish hidden divergence is a potential continuation of  the lower highs in price, which is the equivalent of a potential  continuation in the prevailing downtrend. Bullish hidden divergence  usually occurs during an uptrend, and is characterized by price making a  higher low while the oscillator makes a lower low. In this case, price  and the oscillator are diverging in their signals, but the overriding  signal that should be taken from an occurrence of bullish hidden  divergence is a potential continuation of the higher lows in price,  which is the equivalent of a potential continuation in the prevailing  uptrend.

As with regular divergence, confirmation should also be sought for  instances of hidden divergence before any trades are actually placed.  This confirmation can also take many forms, and usually involves other  technical indications.
Divergences are common and useful signals that are best utilized as  warnings, or confirmations, of potential reversals (regular divergence)  or potential trend continuations (hidden divergence).

EURGBP, H4 Trade Example only with CCI(14)

& Add-Up positions

Buy and sell positions should be ordered when CCI(14) is at the peaks or at the valleys near the +200/-200 line.

Add-up positions

If you would trade normally with 0.1 Lot so divide it by 10 and split  0.01 x 10, if  you trade regularly with 1 Lot per trade so you should  divide by 10 and partition  0.1 x 10. So the trades could often be made  with a maximum of 10 incremental positions (IP's) of 1 Lot or 0.1 lot or  whatever you pay for your average trade.

Preferred Trade: P1 (Enter Short) 2 IP, P2 (Enter Short / Divergence) 5 IP, P3 (Exit all 7 IP & Enter Long) 5 IP, P4 (Exit all 5 IP & Enter Short) 3 IP, P5 (Exit all 3 IP & Enter Long) 5 IP, P6 (Exit all 5 IP & Enter Short) 3 IP, P7 (Exit all 3 IP & Enter Long) 3 IP, P8 (Enter Long / Divergence) 5 IP, P9 (Exit) all 8 IP.

Time Cell Trading means that trade could be made at Daily down whereas at the same time and with the same currency pair trades at lower timeframes (H5, H15, H1) could be executed in the ups.

TCT in conjunction with the concept of the "add-up-positions" (TADUP) gives you a chance of earning the money without a high risk.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hello Froggy10

Look at first only at the overshoot levels [-1/8 or -2/8 and +1/8 or +2/8] at M5, M15, M30 & H1 Timeframes, may be the H4, too and for an extremely long trend at daily, but at daily charts you have often to get out earlier.

More important are the CCI(14) peaks & valley and in conjunction with murrey math, see example GBPJPY, H1 a powerful argument more for getting in or out of the trades.

TCT gives you a lot of freedom how to trade. I like it like specified above. Sometimes I look only at the peaks, sometimes only at murrey math but often to both and if there are "pivots" and "divergences" or "hammers" or "shooting stars" and all these candles, which Steve Nison has described, support or resistance lines...all these are powerful arguments more for waiting any longer or go in the market soon.

The main work of marketanalysis lies for me in the aspect of the multiple time frame analysis before I'll go in a trade. I have often to wait at higher time frames before I invest my money in the jungle of the Forex market.  But there are a lot of currency in the forex market and sometimes I sit hours in front of the monitor and select some currencies with better probabilities of making a profit.

CCI(14)/RSI(14) peaks & valleys has given me a great help since over 7 years now! I think if you can wait and have discipline it's so easy to earn money in this way.

Here's a good short on the GBP/USD, taken using the TCT method. On the M5 the CCI was at +275, RSI was at +150, PA was over -1/8 MM line. It made me a little nervous at first but PA has turned down very nicely. Forexcube would have taken several more shorts with those PA highs, I'm not that brave, yet.

Hello Delage

Nice chart!

This could have been my trades.

If RSI cut CCI from down to up then market will show a higher probabilities, that it will turn up again. How long? We don't know. So I would take a look at  M5 & M15, too, for getting the more global trend.

Preferred Trades: P1 (Enter Short) with +3 IP's, P2 ( Enter Short) with +5 IP's, then Exit Point at EMA20 -5 IP's, due to the fact that M1 trading needs only several pips for profit taking, P3 (Exit) -3IP's.

P1 could be a little more risky, so long as RSI is moving up and cut the CCI from below in an upward movement. May be I would go here in with only 1 IP or 2 IP's. It would be dependent what's going on at M5 and M15.

"Attention at this point for a possible break upwards", if so then I would hedge all the open positions +8 IP's somewhere above that level and would try to counterballance the Hedge positions at the next higher time frames in the following days or if it is convenient to me.

Your charts are excellent for learning all together.

Keep it up!

Kindest regards!

I'll be studying your comments about this trade closely - the point about the RSI turning up through the CCI is interesting, have to think about that. Here's what happened to the remainder of the trade; I left for 4 hours after setting SL at the entry and TP at the pivot reverse line. On returning, the PA had gone down but wasn't near TP, I let it run then PA dropped and I decided to close at the MS1 after it bounced up and down there. Entry at 1.5661 and exit at 1.5559 = 102 pips (3 lots = 306 pips) Not bad for a days work, for me.

Hello Delage

Congratulation!

It's a classical example how to make good profit. Overshoot level (murrey math) and enter short at a CCI peak and exit at a pivot point in a CCI valley. In this environment you have better probabilities for making a profit and so you can go in with several positions.

Excellent work!

USDCAD, M5, 2010 August 19 - Trade Example

Preferred Trades: P1( Enter Short), P2 (Enter Short), then at DS1 1.0259 (Exit & Enter Long), P3 (Exit at mR1 1.0315) or P4 (Exit at DR1 1.0329).

Add-up positions

If you were went in with several positions (e.g. IP's 5) at DS1 1.0259 Enter long it's your option to go out at P3 with e.g. 3 IP's and let the other 2 IP's running further till P4. If market would turn south at P3 you could go out with the rest of 3 IP's and will earn even so a good profit.

USDCHFDaily, 2010 August 19 - Trade Example

How to read false signals in a right way?

The classical drama of market changements.

False signals are generating all indicators in every trading system. Be aware when the market will change and move off in counterpart direction and switch through the time cells (Daily, H4, H1, M30,...).

One way how to read the false signals at Time Cell Trading in a properly manner for a specified currency pair are published below.

Normally P2 would generating an entry order Enter Long. When looking at the details of the daily chart, ...don't jump to the conclusion that it (the decision to enter long) could be right. Why? The last eleven daily candles before shows an indifference. The market isn't clear where to go. The EMA Lines 10 & 20 are beginning to fall down. RSI is falling down at the time intervall where the market are signalising the eleven indifferent candles. Excellent trades should be made at M15, M30, H1 for a range bound trading between murrey math "Ultimate Resistance" [+8/8] and "Weak, Stall & Reverse" [+7/8]. No problem, ...but do not trade at this market environment the Daily chart!

After P2 you realize that the RSI and CCI Indicators are moving up,...whereas the EMA Lines 10 & 20 are moving down. RSI and CCI Indicators could give here false signals to the real market movements, due to the fact of its  mathematical formula (arithmetical design). So it's better here (daily chart) to look primarily at the conformable EMA 10 and EMA20 lines and solve the problem by switching through the time cells (Daily, H4, H1, M30,...).

USDCHF, M5, 2010 August 19

M5 shows a divergence. H1 is in an "extreme Overshoot" [-2/8] level. If the hammer (H1) will stay along so enter long again with several positions at H1, too.

Enter Long at 1.02850/1.02950 with several positions.

USDCHF, H1, see #264

Daily/Weekly: Further downside movements possible since 1.0098 or lowest 2009.11.22 at 0.99137 and should be hedged at M15/M30.

1.02850/1.02950 seems for me a good price.

On UCAD (5min) what was your thinking behind not taking profits/going short (SAR) at the two red boxes??:

1 First box - at BB and CCI OB   1.0272. Why not go short there (without hindsight)?

The only reason I can think of is that it was just before U.S news due = caution. Othewise, we would have been killed on this trade.  Or maybe you were looking at the BB on the M30 and hourly too, which was higher.

2 Second box - at BB, and CCI OB, and at > DR1 by the time the 5min bar that hit DR1 closed (closed at 1.0363 way above DR1). 100 pips higher than first red box.

Now we are at DR2 with CCI divergence at 1.0373, ie. currently we are 40 pips ABOVE where that last red box ended.... about here where this text line ends....

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Also, London close, so maybe day's move is exhausted, I would think factored in too (into your thinking too as to why it would be a good time to take a trade)?

**Makes sense to take a counter move at price exhaustion at London close (ie. a long UCHF trade after a big trend down), just as it makes sense to avoid taking trades just before US news (re the UCAD above). Context matters for every sys. Good trade

Yes, the M30/M15 one. For going down I don't have had enough arguments at M15.

At the same time I have trade the M15 with several positions and here the upward movement was at the beginning whereas M5 has reached its highs. So I decided to go out with M5 not so early, more at these P3/P4 levels. mS1 1.0280 wasn't a real option for me due to the fact that M15 (see chart below, please) was running up in a good way till DR2, mR3 as we could seen later. M15 candle has forming a hammer at DS1 1.0259.

Also possible to go out at mS1 1.0280 when trading the M5, pips should be enough (for a M5 trade) and a winning trade is been made. That's every traders freedom, to go out earlier or take the risk over and let the trade further run.

Taking profit at M5 at DR1 1.0363 is absolutely okay, and then when looking at the upwards drift at M15 (see chart below, please) there are no arguments for an enter short further more. Not so at DR2 1.037 (due to the fact that the next higher pivotal point was reached and a CCI peak) or mR3 1.0385 (here is M15 diverence). At both levels you can go with enter short in the market (if H1/H4 shouldn't told other things).

Hope it helps!

Keept it up!

CADJPY, H4, 2010 August 19

Enter Long at 82.10 with 5 positions and hedge the positions if H4 support don't hold.

Weekly could go further down till "overshoot" [-1/8 ] at 79.68 or "extreme overshoot" [-2/8 ] 78.125. Lowest was 2009.01.18 at 68.38.

CADJPY delivers excellent visual aspects for trading the H1 and the H4, ...at H4 with its peaks and valleys whereas at H1 let your wins run if  EMA10 and EMA20 would go well parallel.

Hello, ForexCube,

Questions in Chart.

Hi Ducke

Closely monitored!

Absolutely correct!.

That was my intention to give you this aspect of Non-Stop-Loss Trading with TCT.

You might see in the future that 80-90 % of all opened positions will run in the wins. The first days since this account is opened was to earn money and now I can make investments at H4 and H1 more. When you see the examples above with CCI tops and bottoms then it's clear that you need more cash for the next winning trades, because it could run one or two waves in the counterpart direction (e.g. forming a divergence)  and then you have to invest once more at the next CCI top or bottom level. See charts above, please. So 100-200 pips could go easily in the counterpart direction (at H4 level), but then market could often turn in your favor. Ergo: This kind of unorthodox trading needs 30-50% of your account capital for making a constant profit over time! My purpose is to trade predominantly with the profit money and not with the deposit money (5'000.-$). All opened positions are in an excellent position for making good profits. Sure! You'll see this in the future. And that's an unorthodox strategy which I intend to post here at this board, now! So it's extremely important to view this account result just now!...and how it will change in the future for understanding this unorthodox kind of strategy. You don't need copy this you can trade in your style and make money with TCT. I trade in this way and I want it post here for all interesting traders. The relation opened trades to history trades are near 1:10. When it'll get lesser then often the lotsizes will increases.

The - 1'996.23$ is money which will run in the win! It's the breath of the market!

Risk is a function of a trader not one of the market. Risk is controlled by position size and by the used strategy and so it's controlled exclusively by the trader!

Hope it helps at first!

Kindest regards

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi FXcube,

Thanks for the great thread. I've had an interest in the CCI indicator for a long time.

When a security is trending I've found that CCI(14) will often go to +/-200 without reversing.

Do you have any advice/filters for this?

Regards,

Wooli

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hello Wooli

So long as EMA10 and EMA20 goes parallel (EMA10 don't intersect the EMA20) let the win run. You can try it with other EMA's (may be EMA5 EMA30 or so)and get a feeling what could be better for your intention. Or switch a time frame higher.

see also p.1,  #1, please.
"Also I have some simple exponential moving averages  e.g. EMA10 & EMA20  to give me clues on the strength of a trend   and the likelihood of mass  traders entry, also an EMA 200 as a long   term moving s/r. "

See p.1, #4 , please.

"EURJPY, M15
As long as EMA lines 10, 20, (may be 50) are running side by side let your win run.

Focus at CCI (14) peaks and valleys in conjunction with Pivots and/or Murrey Math lines and/or EMA lines - the more the merrier."

See also p.17, #252 RSI is crossing the CCI(14) from down to up, so p.18, #270  again

Is at your chart an RSI(14) indicator? I don't think so.

Kindest regards

FXcube

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Tip for advanced level traders

When you trade the H4 in a strong uptrend you can trade the waves (down  after and before the next upward movement) with M1/M5/M15. So let the  big trade (at the higher time frame H4) run up and trade some severals  intermidiate short time down. Candlesticks (e.g. Steve Nison) will help you!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thanks FXcube,

I may have worded my question badly.

If you look at the attached 4H EURUSD chart it is in a strong bullish trend.

I have placed arrows where the CCI breached +200.

Would not the first three arrows have represented losing trades?

Otherwise your draw-down would have been about 600 pips.

Regards Wooli

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi Wooli

It's better sometimes read the thread from the beginning and the comment at  #299. And it would be more respectful when you answer my question at #299 even so. The question came up,  I repeat it again: "Is at your chart an RSI(14) indicator? I don't think so." May be you do not bother to answer to my question. If so, then I don't understand your intention. Then I invite you to ask others your question here on board. May be they will spend time to answer your questions. All is explained. If you are not comfortabel with this trading system need other ones here at FF. It's full of plenty systems. Why to suspend at a trading system which you don't understand? One doesn't do that! You can go on with this "communication style "to put a wrong complexion on s.th.". If so then don't solicit my attention, please.

Wooli you have 22 posts. Respect p.1, #1 the topic: "interest of quality"  #1, please.

Kindest regards.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi FXcube,

I wish to assure you that I don't mean to be disrespectful to yourself or your thread.

I have read all of your posts several times.

You were right. The RSI I posted before was RSI(8) and not RSI(14).

I've attached the same chart with the correct CCI,  RSI and EMA's.

After reading your post #299 again, am I right in assuming that you don't take a counter-trend trade when the EMA's are in alignment and parallel?

Kindest Regards,

Wooli

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hello Wooli

That's  right!. See #4, too, please. It's the same in a downward movement. Countertrend could be then only trade at smaller timeframes. If you need RSI(8) or (14) that isn't important, whatever which size you are more comfortable in your trading...try it with (4) or with (20), could be okay even so.

See  #302 , #307,  #309, please.

You're wellcome!

Kindest regards!

Hello Wooli

See this chart here below, please. Hope it clearifies things a little more!

Pivot Points or murrey math will often help you in your decisions!

Preffered Trades: P1 (Enter Long), P2 (Exit & Enter Short), P3 (Enter Short), P4 (Exit & Enter Long), P5 (Enter Long), P6 (Exit)

P2: After P2 there are 4 indifferent candles and then the bearish engulfing pattern. After this the 10EMA Line crosse the EMA20. You could go short at P2 quite well due to the fact that there was a murrey math at an extreme overshoot level [-2/8], see  #309, please.

Before P1 there is a strong upward trend (see the parallel ascending EMA Lines).

See  #309, please.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
wow, that pic sure is overloaded with info!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
or like this...

EURUSD, H4, 2010 August 23

Preferred Trades: P3 (Enter Short), P4 (Exit & Enter Long), P5 (Enter Long), P6 (Exit & Enter Short), P7 (Exit)

Don't trade at P1, P2. If you do trades here with Enter Short, so you'll earn a profit at P4 also but be aware you trade then counter the upward trend (look at the ascending paralle EMA lines and the RSI between high +50 and high +100)

P3: Here murrey math "Extreme Overshoot" [-2/8)] 4 indifferent H4 candles and then the bearish engulfing pattern, after this EMA10 crosses EMA20 downwards. RSI goes down. All these might be very strong arguments for an entry short.

This had everything going for it, it was with the trend, it had broken above a descending trend line, on the M5 CCI was at 200, with RSI at 50 PA was at 5/8 sell premium zone (that's not shown on the image as the MM lines have shifted). Took sell on the GBP/JPY at 132.48 (check mark) , PA continued up, and took another sell at 132.59 (check mark), as PA hit the daily pivot and started down, with M5 CCI at 125, RSI at 75 and at 6/8 pivot reverse. PA continued down with a few bumps up until I decided it was time to exit at 132.10 (marked by X) with the DS1 and 0/8 ultimate support line with CCI being at -150. That proved to be a good decision, PA continued down then went up. 87 pips total, with 3 lots = 261 pips.

This short on the USD/CAD is an experiment, I took it at 1.0507 at the 1/0 overshoot line and lots of negative divergence but M5 CCI was at -100, hoping PA would drop. It's gone sideways but I think it will drop, given the divergence. Lesson: best stick with classical trades.

While fundamental analysis can explain the forces at play in a bull or bear run, psychology will create the volatility. Fundamental analysis can't explain this. As John Maynard Keynes said: it is extremely dangerous to have a rational investment policy in an irrational world. Clear CCI is also a mathematical formula beyound that if traders used CCI they seems to know something by intuition and is doing so to bounce off waves. What is known is that technical analysis is the only way to measure the emotional component of  the market. We know that many times an ounce of emotion can be worth a  pound of facts. How else to explain the sudden shift in the market  without a change in the fundamentals?

It needs more time to find a trade with a greater or sufficient probability of profit taking. So I stay more at the sideline,...., may be today, may be this week and let my open trades run. May be I trade M1, M5 or M15, but market seems to be to consolidate before his next breakout.

New trades are now with 0.4 or 0.04 or 1.0 Lot so that everybody could discriminate these trades from the old open trades before 2010 August 22 (with 0.02, 0.2, 0.05 lot - see the topic at p.20, #288 , please. 0.5 lot size is free again now and could be further used).

Preferred Trades: P1 (Enter Long), P2 (Enter Long), P3 (Exit & Enter Short), P4 (Enter Short), P5 (Exit & Enter Long), P6 (Exit & Enter Short), P7 (Exit & Enter Long),  P8 ? (Exit).

Trade the range between 1.0165 - 1.642 and be aware of breakouts at the top and the bottom of the range band.

- P7 candle shows a hammer at the bottom range band.

- Daily divergence 1 and divergence2 is a powerful argument for an market entry.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
see  #320, please.

Hi Delage

May be it's not the best time to trade M5 down when daily goes up to the top of the range band this week, see  #321, please. You make more profit when you consider the murrey math. Why not take long at Pivot DS1 and let the win run as long as ascending EMA10/20 goes parallel?,..with the Exit at e.g. next EMA10/20 down crossover or at the "Extreme Overshoot" [+2/8] murrey math?

Not the best time to go in a trade when the EMA lines run horizontal without any vola.

Why not go in a trade when the DS1 at 1.0465 was broken upwards? Risk:Reward was even better at DS1 with an Enter long?.

Would be better to give this trade a miss!:nerd:,..., and the trading time? 18:30 after London close... most traders go away at this time!,...and the validity or significance of divergence after london close without any volatility?,... be careful!,...watch out!

Certainly,  with little leverage is unlikely that the account reaches the Margin  Call.

Unable to  shake things were not looking good on the account. Many operations and little real  gain. The  last four operations are not allowed to see if the account would recover or not,  as you predicted.

Unfortunately, I cannot prove that I am correct, as ForexCube has now deleted the MyFxbook.com account (see below).

+70 positions were closed at 12:00 GMT last night, I did not screen shot that. Unless ForexCube suddenly changed his money management strategy, it was a margin call. (Yes, they even do it on demo accounts).

This account is now deleted with EVERY other MyFxbook.com account ever mentioned in his TraCop1% and his Scalping 10sec, 30sec, 1 min threads.

When you claim that you have been trading this "system" for 6 years,

"TCT is a manual trading strategy. Trades could be triggered within different time frames and can used in ranging and in trending markets. TCT has used since 2004." - from post #1.

...I am going to examine your results thoroughly. All of the accounts have been margined called, that is why they are not displayed any longer.

I have no ill will for ForexCube personally, but I would like to maintain the integrity of the forums.

His strategy appears to be nothing other than not closing losing trades until they  "bounce" back, while "pumping" up the account with many small gains which could be randomly picked and have nothing to do with the "strategy" presented.

106.85 seems for me a fair price to take the risk over: enter long with 5 positions again.

Alpari keep closing down my new demo accounts (which was opened yesterday at 2'500.- $ deposits and in the win with 4'800.-$),..., and it had the same thing keep happening to me until I filled in real  information in the demo registration screen, including a real email. Solid  ever since.

New Demo Broker

I have changed now at FXDD:

Beginning Date: 2010 August 25 - (HR 1)

Deposit: 20'000.-$

This account will be guide with extremely high risk. So drawdowns could be made over 50% to Total Loss.

Target is 4:1, say 3 accounts could be running in a win between 100-300% and the fourth one will suffer a total loss.

It's really completely different as you make more conservative MM statements.

Look at all the open positions, the pending orders and the History File

ForexCube,

A DIBs-type system might suit you (inside bar breakouts). This way an account can't get killed when a range becomes a trend, AND vice versa.

Maybe somewhat like Larry Connor's NR7 bars (find the narrowest range bar in last 7, and trade the breakout of the NR bar), ie. volatility contraction and expansion.

Your various systems all seem to be based on picking tops and bottoms (with MTF CCI, Bollinger bands, pivots, Murrey Math, etc., as filters). Maybe try doing the opposite: find a narrow range (a NR bar or inside bar), and trade the range break.

The key point is no tops and bottoms. That seems to be the achilles heel here. My 2 cents only.

Thank you bit9ret!

Larry Connors is famous for his high-accuracy, short-term trading signals that  focus on price bars without using complex indicators or methods.

Great idea.

Hi bit9ret

Your ideas are excellent and will give the TCT strategy a special effect. Will work it out in the next days. If you have some charts yet upload some/many of these here, please.

I've gotta go, but here are inside bars marked. GU is noisy but this is quite clear here....Breakout/close out of the inside bars.

Go with the expansion of volatility = the close out the range = inside bar. (It's just a coincidence that they are top and bottoms here or are reverting inwards).

Just stay away from mathematical** indis like CCI, BB etc. (OB/OS, even  MTF OB/OS, becomes even more OB/OS = mega trend = account blow up when one fades it) and go for "indis" that mark price bars.

**Mathematical indis process a series of prices and assume serial/self correlation, whereas PA is discontinuous, ie. anything can happen.

Things that are rare tend to be the most valuable. This is the  way that  breakout traders should approach the currency market. I like  to look at breakout  trading from a volatility perspective because the  central idea behind breakouts  is that periods of low volatility are  followed by periods of high volatility.  Sounds complicated? It isn't.
What is the Definition of a Breakout?

According to the American Heritage Dictionary, a breakout is defined as a  forceful emergence from a restrictive condition.
How Does it Apply to Trading?

In  trading, a breakout is a situation where a currency is caught within a   tight range that has a clearly defined support and resistance level.  When the  support or resistance point is broken, a breakout occurs  because the currency  pair forcefully emerges from its restrictive price  range.

The following chart of the EUR/USD is a simple example  of a breakout. In  October 2007, the EUR/USD was trapped within a 200  point trading range for at  least a week with a clearly defined support  and resistance level. When the  resistance level was broken, the EUR/USD  emerged from its range bound  environment and proceeded to rally 400  pips with virtually little retracement.

Unfortunately  finding breakouts on the charts is easy, but trying to time a  breakout  is hard. This is where the Inside Day Strategy that I teach in my book   Day Trading the Currency and advisory service BKTraderFX comes into  play. This  strategy is actually very popular in the world of  professional trading, but new  traders are frequently amazed by its ease  and reliability. Currencies are  extremely trending which increases the  accuracy of Inside Days. Like pink  diamonds, Inside Days are extremely  rare, but when they manifest themselves, the  signal is very powerful.  In order to spot inside days, nothing more is needed  than basic  candlestick charts.
What are Inside Days?

An  inside day is defined as a day where the daily trading range of a  currency  pair is contained within the prior day's trading range. In  other words, the  day's high and low do not exceed the previous day's  high and low as indicated by  the following candlesticks:
http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...p020508-12.gif

Inside days represent decreasing volatility because each day's range is  smaller than the next.

With  the inside day trading strategy, we need to see at least two inside  days  because seeing just one is simply not significant enough. The more  inside days  the better because it increases the likelihood that the  breakout will have  follow through. The inside day trading strategy is  best applied on daily charts  because the longer the time frame, the  more significant the breakout. The  following candles illustrate what  two inside days look like (the candles can be  red or green):
http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...p020508-13.gif
Rules for the Inside Day Trading Strategy

Here are the rules or general guidelines that I like to use for trading  Inside Days:

Long:

1.  Identify a currency pair where the daily range has been contained  within  the prior day's range for at least two days (we are looking for  multiple inside  days).

2. Buy above the high of the most recent inside day.

3. Place stop and reverse order at least 10 pips below the low of the nearest  inside day.

4.  If the position moves higher by the amount that you risked sell half of   the position and replace the stop and reverse with a trailing stop.

Protect  Against False Breakouts: If the stop and reverse order is triggered,   place a stop at least 10 pips below the low of the nearest inside day  and  protect any profits larger than what you risked with a trailing  stop.

The rules are the reverse for a short trade if the breakout occurs to the  downside.
Deconstructing the Trading Rules

No  one likes to follow rules without understanding them and I am big  believer  of understanding the premise behind each rule in my strategies  so that traders  realize which ones are flexible and which ones aren't.

Rule # 1 is the core of the strategy. We MUST see at least two  inside days in  order for the setup to be valid. If there is only one  inside day, the strategy  should not be considered.

Rule # 2 is  the action that puts us into the position. We want to buy at the  first  sign that the range is expanding or that the volatility is increasing.   Therefore we buy as soon as the price breaks above the high of the  closest  inside day candle. More conservative traders who want to make  sure that the  breakout is real can buy when the price breaks above the  inside day candle one  day before the most recent one, but buying then  will also increase the amount of  pips at risk.

Rule # 3 has two  purposes. The first is to act your stop, the second is to  prevent  against false breakouts. Every trade needs a stop and our stop on a long   trade is placed 10 pips below the low of the most recent inside day  because I  believe in technical stops over monetary stops. The idea is  that if we are in a  long trade and the currency breaks below the low of  the most recent inside day,  then the prior breakout is false and no  longer valid. However, given the  significance of an inside day  breakout, we actually add an order to short when  the long position is  closed so that we can capitalize on a breakout to the  downside.

Rule  #4 is the most flexible. Here, we exit half of the position for nothing   other than a monetary reason. Then we move our stop to breakeven on  the second  lot and trail our stop so that we can capture as much of the  breakout moves as  possible. Aggressive traders may choose to trail by a  1 bar low while  conservative ones choose to trail by a 3 or 5 bar low  or a technical indicator.

Now let us take a look at an example:

In  the same EUR/USD chart shown above, we actually see our two inside days  in  the area highlighted. According to our trading rules, we go long  the EUR/USD  when it breaks the high of the most recent inside day at  1.4280. Our initial  stop and reverse order is placed at the low of the  closest inside day minus 10  pips or 1.4179. This means that we are  risking 101 pips. Therefore our initial  target is the amount risked or  1.4381, which was triggered the very next day.  Then we moved our stop  on the remaining half of the position to breakeven. We  trail the stop  by a 2 bar low, meaning that we only exit the position when the  price  of the currency pair has broken below the low of the past two days. This   happens 12 days after we put on the initial trade and we end up  closing the  second half of our position at 1.4554 for a profit of 101  pips on the first lot  and 274 pips on the second.

Key Points to Remember

The  Inside Day trading strategy works best on Daily charts and currency  pairs  that are very trending such as the EURUSD, USDJPY, and GBPUSD.  For further  optimization, technical formations can be used in  conjunction to the visual  identification to place a higher weight on a  specific direction of the breakout.  For example, if the inside days are  building and contracting towards the top of  a recent range such as a  bullish ascending triangle formation, the breakout has  a higher  likelihood of occurring to the upside. The opposite scenario is also   true, if inside days are building and contracting towards the bottom of a  recent  range and we begin to see a bearish descending triangle is in  formation, the  breakout has a higher likelihood of occurring to the  downside.

Trading the Inside Bar Strategy in Forex

Posted on April 14th, 2009
Inside Bar Forex Trading Entry

This article will discuss the Inside bar trading strategy , a trading  method I have used successfully for most of my trading career. My  trading involves all methods pertaining to price action, they are not  used in conjunction with indicators or other systems. I use a plain  vanilla price charts tp look for the inside bar and other patterns as  they form naturally on 240 minute and daily price charts.
What is an inside bar ?

An inside bar is a bar or series of bars which is/are completely within  the range of the preceding bar, or , i.e. it has a higher low and lower  high than the bar immediately before it (some traders use a more lenient  definition of inside bars to include equal bars). On a smaller time  frame it will look like a triangle.
What Does it mean?
An inside bar indicates a time of indecision or consolidation.  Inside bars often occur at tops and bottoms, in continuation flags, and  at key decision points like major support/resistance levels and  consolidation breakouts. They often provide a low-risk place to enter a  trade or a logical exit point.
When to use the signal

The most logical time to use an inside bar is when a strong trend is in  progress or the market has clearly been moving in one direction and then  decides to pause for a short time. If we play the break out, our stop  loss can be defined by placing it below the half way point of the  outside bar or mother candle, or for the more conservative trader, below  the outside bar itself. This would mean that the market muse break a 3  bar low to take us out of the trade.

These inside bars are very good when trading a trend on the 240 minute charts and the daily charts.
Special Notes

More advanced traders may also identify market turning points when  trading against the trend, but this wil take plenty of screen time to  learn, so its not suggested for novice traders.

The Inside bar forex strategie is a flashing light, a major signal to the trader that reversal or continuation is about to occur.

See the example below for a classic inside bar break out, and a classic inside bar stall pattern.

My Price Action Setups: Pin Bars, Fakey’s, Inside Bars

Posted on January 17th, 2010
My 3 core Price Action Setups: Pin Bar, Fakey, Inside Bar  Pin Bar Setup:

The pin bar is a staple of the way I trade the forex market. It has a  very high accuracy rate in trending markets and especially when  occurring at a confluent level. Pin bars occurring at important support  and resistance levels are generally very accurate setups. Pin bars can  be taken counter trend as well, as long as they are very well defined  and protrude significantly from the surrounding price bars; indicating a  strong rejection has occurred. In the following chart example we will  take a look at pin bars occurring with the context of a trending market,  my favorite way to trade them. Notice how each pin bar resulted in  movement that met or exceeded the next logical resistance point, marked  on the chart as “target”

Pin bars occurring within the context of a trending market on the GBP/JPY daily chart:
http://learntotradethemarket.com/wp-...ads/gbpjpy.gif
Fakey Setup:

The fakey setup is another bread and butter price action setup. It  indicates rejection of an important level within the market. The forex  market is designed to fake traders out, as often times the market will  appear to be headed one direction and then reverse, sucking all the  amateurs in as the professionals push price back in the opposite  direction. The fakey setup can set off some pretty big moves in the  forex market. The chart we will look at below shows a fakey that  occurred in the EUR/USD market that set off a huge down ward movement.

Nice fakey setup that occurred at a major turning point on EUR/USD daily:
http://learntotradethemarket.com/wp-...ds/eurusd3.gif

Inside Bar Setup:

The inside bar is a great trend – continuation signal. It shows a  brief consolidation and then a break out in the dominant trend  direction. Inside bars are best played on daily and weekly charts. They  allow for very small risks and yet very large rewards. The inside bar  combined with a very strongly trending market is one of my favorite  price action setups. We can see in the chart below an inside bar that  formed on daily USD/JPY after a strong pin bar signal changed trend  direction. This inside bar occurred at a 50% retrace level as well as a  support level, whenever we get price action at a confluent level like  this it is viewed as a very strong setup.

EURJPY, M15, 2010 August 25

Trading Example

with CCI(14) indicator and the price action

(Inside Bars or/and Engulfing pattern)

Preferred Trades: P1(Short), P2(Short), P3(Exit & Long), P4(Short), P5(Exit & Long), P6(Short), P7(Short), P8(Exit & Long), P(9) ?, P10(Short)

P9: Normally when trading only with CCI(14) it's a Short. The following inside bars couldn't give the confirmation, so I would it let short and go with the second inside bar long (hedging position) till P10. P10 is Exit and Short and I have to wait with one open position Short at P9 if the price will falling under the P9 line.

Time Cell Trading means that you can trade the same currency pair at different timeframe at the same time. If you are interested in maximizing your profits it is important that you trade the smaller timeframes in the main trend of the bigger ones.

Make your exercices how much you earn net, if you trade all signals at M15, H1, H4 and daily at an time interval, say over 4 weeks only with the CCI(14) tops and bottoms. May be someone can write an expert advisor. I don't know.

How do I figure this out: you say, on the EUR/JPY, the daily trade long, the H4 to trade short and the H1 to trade long. I'm not too worried about the H1, the H4 will override it but when will I know when to exit according to the daily? When will PA go long? I have 3 shorts on now and been watching the different time frames and can't make sense of it. Sometimes they drop, other times jump up and I think it's a trend change but then they drop back down.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hello Delage

Go out at each time frame with your specific positions when CCI(14) has reached  the other side of the CCI tops or bottoms.

To consider the pro's and con's I would overstate the bigger trend and if there nothing around tend to trade all timeframes inclusive M5 and M15. If you have now only shorts be aware that the bigger chart (daily) is showing up. So it could be dangerous to get in the market with more down positions as ups. Moreover since several weeks EURJPY is going the range 106.50/107-113/114. If there isn't a breakout probabilities seems higher for trading the range any longer. The market is giving ambigous signals at the time. That is okay! ...if you take a look at EURUSD, and other currencies,.., it seems most of the currencies at the forexmarket are now anywhere in the middle (the most of them have left its extreme points), ...so the market don't know where to go, why not? Market at EURJPY could also go till 92.6 - 89.25 (monthly chart). Time Cell Trading take account of this. You could go out at every single time frame apart! You can use CCI(14) & Inside Bars or other price action parameters. Most of the time the CCI(14) + Inside bars seems to give a valid and reliable information.

Hope it helps!

Kindest regards

EURUSD, H4, 2010 August 27

H4 divergence and an inside bar might be good arguments for an enter short.

Take the risk with:

Enter Short at 1.2710 with 3 positions

Target: 1.2655 / 1.2610 / 1.2545

...or all positions at the next CCI(14) bottom

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thanks for the advice. I was wondering about holding it long term, maybe several days but I don't like to sleep on open positions ( I take demo trading very seriously). I've decided that I'm probably best suited to take the CCI highs and lows on the M15. Here's the trade, I took sells at 107.501, 107.634 and 107.611 and there were a few other places I could have entered also. Finally decided to exit at 107.278 for 76 pips.

Monthly chart seems to be in a slight downward channel, see  #401. Prices at H1 has reached the "Overshoot level" [+1/8] murrey math & mR2 0.7109, see #402 .

H4 CCI(14) top is reached.

Target 1.7081 (R1) / 1.7030 (DP)

Daily's positive divergence, see #403 could be a risk. Trade intermediate further ups with M15/M30 till 0.7324 murrey math "Ultimate resistance" [8/8]

NZDUSD, Monthly. 2010 August 29

Monthly Candles are forming lower highs and lower lows and seems to go slightly downwards.

Trading the monthly downward channel could be an option when you take the risk over with the actual daily regular positive divergence, see #403. So breakout at the top green and blue lines could be very strong if it would happened. So trading the main trend down and the little ups with M15/30, ...that might for me a favorite trading design for the next days (may be weeks) with NZDUSD.

If I am interested in measure up the probabilities for better market entries so I have to work out a market analysis at different time frames. Time Cell Trading is given the market it's breath at the different time levels. When EMA Lines are beginning to run parallel parallel it is a sign that the market will loose his volatility and changing his trending movements (parallel up-/or downwards) into a range one.

For getting a more global view it is a must to look at higher time frames (Weekly and Monthly).

You could go out at mR1 108.76 (P4) but EMA Lines are running strong upwards parallel. The second peak H1 has then forming a divergence (Distance between 4th circle at CCI(14) (mR1 108.76)(P4)   and murrey math "Ultimate resistance" [8/8] (P5).

P1 at this chart below is P5 at #384.

Profit: +200 pips

Personally  I see the use to let the market its breath, so you give also all others fellow-men traders his respect if there are in line with you or not. Moreover, we don't know where the market will go. What we have are some useful and hopefully simple indicators and/or parameters which could give us some higher probabilities for making a profit in the forex market.

Currency markets are particularly well known for long-term trends, which are in turn caused by long-term macro-economic trends, such as interest rate tightening or easing cycles. But even in currency markets, historical analysis reveals that trending periods only account for about 1/3 of price action over time, meaning that about two-thirds of the time there is no trend to catch.

AUDCAD, H4, 2010 September 01

As trading occurs on currency comparison, it is easy to trade AUD/CAD in  any economic environment. As both countries are major commodity  exporters, both currencies are influenced by commodity prices, with the  CAD specifically affected by oil prices.

One Australian dollar is exchanged for 0.959 Canadian dollar (0.959 cents) today.

AUDCAD H4 has reached a CCI(14) Top. So daily, too.

A divergence has forming since 2010.08.27

It seems to be an acceptable probabilitiy for a market entry just now.

May be the forex rate will increased till 0.9912 (High at 2009.11.01) and would reflect a strengthening Australien dollar as compared with the Canadian dolar further more. If you think like this, so you should buy, if you expected that the Australian dollar would continue to strengthen against the Canadian dollar. I prefere to take at this level then one enter short (with 2 positions) once more.

Enter Short at 0.959 with 3 positions.

This kind of general rule would be used more often then not.

One Trade per currency are worth 10 positions. Every currency pair trade could allocated accurate to a tenth. So if a trade is normally 2 Lot it has been devided by 10. 10 x 0.2 Lot. If a trade could be 1 Lot it could also split in 10 x 0.1 or 5 x 0.2, or 2 x 0.5, ...and so on.

Carefully consider the strategy you are going to employ. Be wary of daytrading systems that encourage you to trade often and at all hours. This is rarely conducive to long-term success. Analyze your schedule. When does your regular life leave some spare time to spend in the market? If spare time is at a premium, Time Cell Trading long-term/investing will likely suit you best, due to the fact it requires less moment to moment attention. Find your time cells that suits your life and lifestyle - not the other way!

Market Tip

In Forex we don't have the burdon of financial statements  by itself. However, we can still analyze a currency's condition  (strength or weakness) based on a number of factors. Combined, these  give us a better indication of a particular trade's worthiness. If you  insist upon predicting future movement (and I wish you wouldn't), you  should be familiar with a minimum: > The currency's behavioral  characteristics, say how much does it move (hourly?, daily?, weekly?),  does it moves abruptly?, gradually?, does it spike?. > The  economies of the currency pairs (strong?, weak?, budget deficits or  surplius?). > The general market trend (up, still, down). > Where  the current market price is relative to today's movement, yesterday's-,  last week's-, last month's-,... > How do the microcharts (M1, M5,  M15, M30, H1) relates to the macro- (4h, daily, weekly, monthly); and so  on. Market  Tip to connoted as trade examples - these  are trades how  I would like  to realise it in the given market  situation so to say a  display windows  of some of my trades.

The sole purpose of Forex trading  is to earn profit while trading by making the right trade. Planning is  very important to be successful; otherwise, you will loose your capital.  Although, Forex is a fast moving and risky investment. If you are going to  invest in the currency market, you must think about what strategy you  are going to be using.

Moving averages as the basic indicator at Forex.

The given chapter is dedicated to the problem of Moving Averages          (MA). It is one of the principal indices at Forex. In their book "Computer          analysis of future markets", Ch. Lebo and D. Douglas state that the greatest          sums of real money are earned by making use exactly of the MA index. Even          taken together, all other technical indices are less helpful. This is          true. However, Ch. Lebo and D. Douglas have not mentioned that 19 of 20          traders do lose their game when they mainly use this index (MA).

Here I try to expose the origin of such a high rate of losses and losers          (19 of 20 traders!). The losses are caused by a somewhat simplified approach          to the utilization of this so important technical index by "classicists"          of Forex. The analogous view on MA index is inherent in the up-to-date          analysts as well. Further, traders do the same. However, for the latter          misunderstanding of the analytical approach to MA results in losses          of real money at Forex.

The ground course concerning MA one can get gratis in School of Trading          for the Beginners at Forex, attached to Masterforex-V Trading Academy.          Otherwise, the same information will cost you $200-500 at training courses,          attached to forex brokers.

Take a look at the charts submitted by J. Murphy in his book "The technical          analysis of future markets" (Part 9). There plots are keep on "migrating"          (roaming) from one manual of Forex to another.
http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image002.jpg
Chart 14.1. There is an example of combination of the 10-days simple          MA (SMA) with the 40-days one. The reader should pay attention how accurately          the tendency in price movement is repeated by the short 10-days MA. The          40-days MA is behind of the price movement somewhat farther. MA value          evens up (levels) the spread of prices. At the same time, these          MA are always keep on being behind from the market dynamics in time. The          10-days MA is designated as the solid line; the 40-days MA is presented          in the form of the dotted line.
http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image004.jpg

Chart14.2. There is an example of the 20-days simple MA. Traders          regard intersectios of MA curves by prices as signals for          opening the corresponding positions. In the period that corresponds to          the chart right border, the price indices are below the MA curve. This          indicates that the market is at the stage in decline (fall, decay).          One should pay attention to the following fact. The 20-days MA curve evens          up (levels) the price dynamics. All the same, this 20-days MA curve          is keeping behind from the market dynamics in time.

According to these pictures, everything is clear - isn't it? That is,          at a certain point one must stake on "sell", at another point one must          stake on "buy", etc. Probably, looking at this chart, any beginner could          think that his account would be doubled after several days of the work          at Forex. However, in fact, just 1 of 20 traders does earn his money.          At the same time, all traders (19 losers included) make use of MA index          in this or that form during their work at Forex.

Hence, one must get to learn how to make use of MA in order to gain profit          but not to sustain damages.

First, let us examine the problems concerning MA. One must understand          the reasons why the majority of traders lose their money when using MA.          After this, one must find the way-out.
The problem #1. Which charts the classicists of Forex do not include          into their manuals.

Let us scrutinize the graphs given below. After this, you can clearly          understand why 19 of 20 traders leave Forex for good.

Moving averages as the basic indicator at Forex.

Chart 14.5. From February 16 till April 16 of 2006, in GBP/USD          pair movement 10th and 40th MA have 13 times intersected one          another.
http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image008.gif
Chart 14.6 (the continuation (prolongation)). From March 14          till April 7 of 2006, in GBP/USD pair movement 10th and 40th          MA have intersected one another 9 times.

The conclusions are the following.

Here we deal with a flat. In contrast to the trend, in a flat MA don't          "obey" the rules submitted in the classical manuals. Rather on the contrary,          when a quicker (faster) MA intersects a slower one, it can be a          sign of an imminent reversal. Respectively, a deal must be open in the          direction opposite to the MA opening. Such a situation is typical          of a trend within the time frame (TF) smaller than a flat within a larger          TF.

Conclusions.

·  One must not regard MA separately from the flat and trend - how          it has been done in all classical manuals of Forex.

·  As regards the duration in time, a flat is longer than a trend.

·  First of all, you must learn to clearly distinguish the moment          of the flat finish (end) from the start of a trend (and v.v.).          Only after this you may open a real account at Forex. Otherwise, you will          lose your money - as it does happen to 19 of 20 traders.
The problem #2. Within what TF one should work with MA. Some classicists          of Forex prefer D1 (DeMarque). J. Murphy uses M5 (for the intra-day trading)          and up to W1. E. Neiman and B. Williams use D1, W1, etc.

However, these specialists avoid answering the principal question. That          is, what a trader must do when MA are reversed towards different directions          in various TF.

· For instance, within M5 MA go upwards.

· Within H1 they go downwards.

· On the contrast, MA do come together in the chart H4.

A. Elder has partially explained this problem in his three-shield system.          Advantages and drawbacks of this approach are examined in a separate chapter.
The problem #3. There can be trends strong (heavy) or weak          (feeble). Let us examine a trend of the simplest kind - i.e., the          intra-session one (see the chart on February 13, 2006). To the participants          of Masterforex-V Trading Academy, I recommended the following.
a). As regards the European session on February 13, 2006, I advised          to make super-short deals on "sale" with GBP/EUR pair.
b). As regards the American session on February 13, 2006, I advised          to make super-short deals on "buy" with the same currency pairs (GBP/EUR).

c). As regards the European session on February 14, 2006, I recommended          to make a prolonged deal on "sale" (all over the trading session).

d). As regards the American session on February 14, 2006, I advised to          make super-short deals on "buy" with the same currency pairs.

In any classical manual of Forex the criteria of the difference between          the strong (heavy) or weak (feeble) trends are not pointed          out. Consequently, the two advices to a trader can be given.

A). to "allow the profit to come in (to flow)" when the trend          is strong (heavy).

B). to open super-short deals to gain the profit of 10-20 points because          the currency pair movement is restricted, which is detectable during the          very first movements.

This technique, when used in the daily trading in Masterforex-V Trading          Academy, gives reasons to doubt the correctness of the statements made          by Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas. In their book "The computer analysis of future          markets", the authors state that MA indices always indicate the trend          direction. However, with MA one cannot estimate the trend strength (the          heaviness or weakness of this trend). It is especially important if          one estimates the trend strength with the help of MA indices, taken from          other systems of Forex technical analysis.
Problem #4. MA index drawbacks exert influence on other technical          indicators, based on them (MA). Therefore, such indicator will deceive          a trader during trades even more than MA do it.

For instance, there are MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence          ), Alligator, Awesome Oscillator, CCI (Commodity Channel Index), Moving          Average Envelopes, Moving Average of Oscillator, Bollinger Bands,           Stochastic Oscillator, etc. All such indices are based on MA. When developing          such indices, the authors issued from MA. Further each of them added to          this basis what he liked. It could be the rate of change in the price,          the trading volume, the closing price value with respect to the previous          data, etc. Who has added what to MA does not make a secret. One can learn          it, for instance, from MetaTrader software engineers from MetaQuotes Software          Corp.

In this connection, there arise the following questions.

1.  What for each author adds to MA a characteristic according to          his own choice?

2.  Why there are so many indicators and, consequently, their developers?          Why an improvement, made by one creator, has not satisfied a subsequent          author?

3.  What a drawback is inherent in the notion of MA itself - so          that they must be infinitely (and to no effect) be improved, being unusable          in their original form?

Each of corrections made in MA is all the same imperfect. Really, just          MetaTrader software contains dozens of technical indices. The majority          of them are just another attempt at bringing those very MA to perfection.          And this relates just to the indices selected by MetaTrader software engineers!          The reader can guess how many indices have been sifted out (rejected)          by these specialists. Probably, the reader will be confused when I'll          tell that the number of indices excluded from MetaTrader software is even          larger than that of the included ones.

Hence, a large number of professionals waste their time, understanding          that the indices available are unusable. You can judge by yourself. Let          us put oscillators at the foot (bottom) of the chart. One can pick          them out of one's choice - even all of them. In practice, all charts demonstrate          the same. That is, each of newer designers has realized the drawbacks          in the work of his predecessor. However, an original oscillator, developed          by every new specialist, indicates the same data as oscillators developed          by a previous author.

In this connection, one of my students (a military man in the past) made          joke: "it is like to keep on reparing the reciprocator instead of replacing          it by the jet".
Problem #5. According to J. Murphy, the following approach is          axiomatic in the framework of the classical Forex (see "technical analysis          of future markets"; Part 9). The point of entering the deal is the crossing          of a slower MA by a quicker one. For instance, if MA #10 intersects MA          #40 top-down, this corresponds to opening a deal on "sell". I can give          thousands of examples when the deal opening in accordance with this formula          was too late. This can happen in the cases of the trend strategic/tactical          correction - especially under the conditions of strategic reversals. Otherwise,          the deal opening according to this formula can be erroneous (fallacious)          - in a flat. The above-given charts illustrate some cases when the opening          according to this formula is wrong.

Thus, a vicious circle becomes developed. On the one hand, the period          length must be taken into account in order to exclude the "market noise"          influence. On the other hand, one must consider the delay in MA as compared          with real changes in the market. This problem is still unsolved.

·  The higher is MA number (100, 200), the weaker is MA reaction          to the "market noise". At the same time, the delay in MA during reversals          is more considerable.

·  The smaller is MA number (5, 10), the more intensive is MA reaction          to the "market noise". That is, an ordinary (common) correction          can be mistaken for a heavy and rash reversal.
Problem #6. For traders, improvement in MA results in consequences          even worse. All theorists and traders acknowledge that MA are being late.          However, methods in solving the given problem are imperfect (so to say,          "middle-of-the-road"). For instance, instead of simple MA, the following          improved versions are submitted:

* Exponential Moving Average;

* Smoothed Moving Average;

* Linear Weighted Moving Average.

There are individuals who prefer to change simple MA into exponential          MA, etc. (they consider this to be the means of optimization this index).          J. Murphy struck such "admirers" the heaviest blow. In "technical analysis          of future markets" (Part 9), he quoted a certain statistics. These data          were initially submitted in the paper "Computers will help you in the          game at future markets" by Hockhaimer in YB "Commodities", 1978. There          the analysis is given to effectiveness of different ??? (TA) in          the period 1970-1976 at various future markets. The conclusion is the          following. The simple MA is the most effective.

Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas arrived at the analogous conclusion. These authors          admit that there is a seeming (apparent) refinement of weighted-          and exponential MA. However, in practice, every test observed or carried          out by them indicates decided superiority of simple MA to all others from          the viewpoint of gaining profit. According to Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas, the          application of exponential MA, as a rule, results in "jerking", too costly          for traders. This confirms the authors' opinion. That is, if a method          of entering the deal is based on obscure calculations, there are more          negative consequences of its application than positive ones. The future          trade is rather art than a science. The mathematical refinement of a method          does not guarantee profits.

Such conclusions makes a true shock for those who neglect the problem          of MA - for those who just prefer to replace simple MA by exponential-,          smoothed- and linear-weighted ones. In particular, this concerns E. Neighman.          The latter, in "Trader's small encyclopedia", persistently (strongly)          recommends to apply the exponential MA (EMA). He states that simple MA          to times reacts to one change in the course. Figuratively speaking, the          simple MA (SMA) "barks" as a dog. For the first time this happens when          a new value is received. For the second time the "barking" is heard when          this value is quitted from the calculation of MA. As compared with SMA,          EMA reacts to the change in one value of the course just once - i.e.,          when this value is received. This is why EMA is preferable.
Comments. As the charts given below indicate, MA crosses          the price 11 times. However, where did E. Neiman see dogs who cannot          "bark" more than once or twice? One can imagine how many traders have          lost their deposits due to the recommendations given by E. Neiman - a          "cynologist" at Forex.

The charts submitted below confirm my statements. Everybody can          compare SMA with EMA in order to independently answer the following question.          Is it preferable to apply rather EMA than SMA (as E. Neiman insists)?          Or the difference between these indices is minimal? As one can see, analysts          of Forex just play with exponential-, smoothed- and linear-weighted MA.          In practice, various "improvements" in SMA do not heighten the working          trader's profits.

Chart 14.8. EUR/USD pair movement on April 17-24, 2006

Both J. Murphy and Hockhaimer were perfectly correct in pointing out          the difference between SMA and EMA. At the same time, they have not drawn          the principal conclusion that one can easily make issuing from the statistics          submitted by these authors. That is both types of MA just slightly differ          one from another. Besides, the same drawbacks are inherent in the both          variants of MA.

·  According to J. Murphy, deals must be opened after a slower MA          is intersected by a faster one. However, in this case occurs a substantial          (time) delay. This is depicted in the above-given charts (the intersection          of MA ##10, 40). One can clearly see that MA intersection takes place          when almost a half of the path is already passed through.

·  According to J. Murphy, a deal must be opened not after the first          intersection of MA ##10 and 40 but after the second one (the so-called          "optimization"). However, I can give a large number of examples where          the 1st intersection yields hundreds point of profit. At the          same time, the 2nd intersection occurs in a flat (in its essence,          it is attenuation of the previous basic movement). That is, J. Murphy          does not recommend opening a deal during this basic intensive movement!          Besides, as one can see in these charts, MA 12 times intersect one another.          According to J. Murphy, which intersection is the 2nd one?

·  How can J. Murphy recommend such "optimization" when it results          in the following?

·  Table 14.1*, see attachment, please

As one can see, J. Murphy's results after his "optimization" are worse          than 50/50. That is 322 deals of 608 are made at a loss.

·  J. Murphy made an attempt to artificially combine MA with timing          loops (time cycles). For this purpose, he made use of Fibonacci          number "mysticism". That is, he chose Fibonacci numbers according to his          own tastes. Applying such numbers in some cases, under other conditions          he "happily forgot" about them. In this sense, the case of MA ##10 and          40 is typical.

·  J. Murphy has not elaborated a universal combination of MA. In          each example different combinations of MA are submitted (either 10-40          or 1-21, or 13-34-144, or 4-9-18, etc.).

And what is more, according to J. Murphy, MA duration must be chosen          so that it should correspond to the cycles that determine the given market          development.

As a trader, I arrive at the distressing conclusions concerning          J. Murphy technique of MA application at Forex - as J. Murphy gives examples          of currency pairs.

·  J. Murphy uses different combinations of MA at the daily trades.          Hoever, as a trader, he has not elaborated his own "working" combination          of MA.

·  Different MA can be required for different charts. J. Murphy          clearly garbles historical examples of situations at the market, suitable          for various combinations of MA.

·  J Murphy himself considers that one can get a reliable prognosis          with the help of his charts. The reader can develop his own opinion concerning          this statement. Just I wonder, of what kind this "reliable prognosis"          can be. Really, a universal technique of giving analysis to the market          is not developed. In addition, in different situations different MA are          used.

·  However, J. Murphy never kept back that he was not a trader but          a "technical analyst" and a Professor in New-York Financial Institute.          In spring, 1981 the leadership of this institute ask him to organize a          course of the technical analysis.

As far as I'm concerned, I made no secret of my attitude towards "analysts".          Really, to what the latter can teach a beginner or an experienced trader          if such "analyst" cannot work at the stock exchange himself?

As it is evident, an author of detective stories (even the most gifted          individual but not a lawyer) will never be invited to lecture in a department          of law. At the same time, the analogous situation at Forex is almost a          rule. For instance, training courses at forex brokers are mainly based          on the books by J. Murphy and E. Neiman. I have already exposed mistakes,          inaccuracies and drawbacks, inherent in just one chapter (#9) of the book          "technical analysis of future markets" by Murphy. As regards the whole          book, the number of incorrectnesses of various types is about several          hundreds. All courses of training attached to various forex brokers contain          those very mistakes. As the result, at least 19 of 20 traders lose their          deposits.

As regards E. Neiman's recommendations concerning the order of sequence          of MA numbers, the situation is not better.

Giving analysis to the 6-day chart of prices, this author uses 1-8; 8-13;          8-21; 1-21. He states that contradictions in the signal can happen at          the intersections between 55-144 and 89-144.

Giving analysis to the daily chart of prices, this author uses 8-13;          8-21; 1-55; 1-89. No contradictions are observed.

Giving analysis to the 3-hour chart of prices, this author uses 34-55;          1-89; 1-144; 8-89. The contradictions in the signal can happen at the          intersections between 13-144 and 21-144.

Giving analysis to the hourly chart, this author uses 1-34; 34-55; 1-144;          8-89. The contradictions in the signal can happen at the intersection          between 55 and 89.

Giving analysis to the £15-min chart of prices, this author uses          34-144; 1-144; 1-55.

And now let us scrutinize these statements.

What kind of MA must be chosen when a chart D1 is displayed at the trader's          terminal? Among 8-13, 8-21, 1-55, 1-89 what pairs would be preferable?

Probably, independently of the chosen MA, the result of such "recommendations"          by E. Neiman will be the same. I would like once more to emphasize that          19 of 20 traders all over the world regularly lose their deposits. By          te way, what a combination does E. Neiman use by himself in tradings?

Any working trader will submit his own combinations of MA numbers. After          this, he will add other MA numbers that can be used.

However either E. Neiman or J. Murphy and other "analysts" don't do this.          Probably, E. Neiman, a leading employee of "UkrSocBank", has no MA working          combination of his own. Maybe, he just writes "financial bestsellers".          According to Alpina public house, in his books the basic notions and techniques,          necessary for the successful trading, are submitted in the form easy of          access. This is a point to be considered.
Problem #7. There exists a general rule, correct for the business          of any kind: to buy cheaply and to sell expensively. How this rule can          be correlated with the principles of work with MA?

One must clearly detect circumstances when it is possible to          work against the rules of MA - i.e., in contradiction to the classicists'          viewpoints. For instance, one can work against the principal tendency          of Ch. Dow. In one's work, one may work against the rules of MA and contradict          ideas of J. Murphy, E. Neiman, or Ch. Lebo and D. Lucas. These rules are          not submitted in any manual of Forex.

There is an example of the real work against MA rules. It is taken from          Masterforex-V Trading Academy in the on-line-regime (see April 19, 2006).          One should pay attention to the following chart.
http://www.masterforex-v.su/images_b...4/image010.gif
Chart 14.9.

According to Masterforex-V, "sells" of EUR have been closed at 1.2286.          The corresponding reasoning one can find in the chargeable enclosures.          In particular, there the problems of calculating a local peak, of getting          into a lock at this peak, etc. are examined.

Participants of Masterforex-V closed forum made the following remarks          about the chart on April 19, 2006.

·  The maximal point of GBP course is 1.7938-46, the local          peak being at 1.7938. That is, opening a deal in vicinity to 1.7853, a          participant ("rich") has correctly calculated GBP stock reserve          - i.e., 85-93 points per the trading session.

·  On April 20, 2006, at 22.16, another participant ("hawt")          opened a branch, called "the death of EUR". I must emphasize that here          we deal just with the trading on April 20, 2006. During that day EUR fell          more than by 112 points - from 1.2396 down to 1.2284 under the condition          of the ascending intra-week trend. That very day GBP, the currency allied          to EUR, fell by 186 points (from 1.7938 down to 1.7752).

Now we scrutinize the above-given chart. We are interested in detecting          the signs that can permit us to predict EUR and GBP reversal with respect          to USD -several hours earlier than the reversal can actually happen. One          must also take into account that the chart depicts the situation the half          of the day before the MA #10 crossing MA#40 downwards. Accurately dealing          with these details, one can understand a series of rules of working against          MA reversal. One can regard the conclusions made by Ch. Dow and J. Murphy          a new. According to these authors, the tendency can be seen just from          the inside (in the middle of it). J. Murphy states the following. No system          that follows a tendency can capture (absorb, usurp) either the          summit of the market or its foundation - i.e., the origins of the ascending          or descending tendencies. The corresponding attempts are not prospective.          This problem is in detail discussed in "technical analysis of future markets"          (Part 2) by J. Murphy.

In brief, one can make the following conclusions.

·  MA is an important parameter from the viewpoint of giving analysis          to Forex market and gaining regular profits there.

·  At present, the MA problem presentation technique by "classicists"          of Forex has clearly appeared in deadlock. This is why the overwhelming          majority of traders lose their money.

·  I would like to emphasize the following. Either the numbers of          MA, or their modifications (the simple-, exponential-, or linear weighted          MA) do not matter. One must clearly distinguish when the work either along          - or against MA reversal would be preferable. The reader must open a real          account not earlier clearly understanding of the following factors. One          must know when to work on the MA reversal and when against it. One must          see with which other systems of analysis the technique of MA should be          combined - in order to detect long and super-short deals. One must learn          the signs of reversal and the trend continuation - as well as correlation          between the trends themselves. You see, your chances to get into the company          of 19 traders-losers from 20 are considerably prevail the opportunity          of being 1 of 20 traders who regularly gains profit at Forex.

Why would you want to split one trade in so many positions. So many would be more difficult to manage. Rather than 10 positions why not 5 or even better 4.

Can you explain the logic in this.

Hi bcarbon

First of all it is a style like I trade. Other interested traders could trade their position styles in their ways.

If you have take a look at the open trades you'll have noticed that every open position with the same currency pair could defined with different exit points.

Personally I don't like "the main trade". I like many parts of them, called positions. So one trade have for me max. 10 positions. If I would go in the market with two positions at EURUSD I calculated then with 20 positions maximum. So I can go later in with even more 3 or 4 or 8 positions, if the market price has moved more up or down.

Position trading can yield far better results across varying market conditions than a single main trade approach.

Often I trade with several positions at different time frames and/or only for a few minutes, and/or let other ones run at several murrey math levels and/or till different pivotal points. So I can go erlier out with a part of them and/or at different timeframe levels and let the other further race. Often if price moves in counterpart direction I go in with several positions next lower/higher level again. For me it istn't something "confusing", so I make it since *"thousend of years"!

See also #439.

By contrast with "easy" and "not so easy" orders, - of course, you know it is not that simple - I compare my positions more like Huskies, well-arranged and extremely sportive (they could go in this direction or even so in the counterpart one). No problem for me to keep track of. May be not something for everybody. One spot is as good as another.

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/commodity-channel-index.html

First the Commodity Channel Index was developed as  the indicator for determining of reversal points in the commodity  markets. But then it became rather popular in the share market and in  Forex market. CCI was created by Donald Lambert.

The supposition on which the indicator is based consists that all  actives move under influence of definite cycles, and maxima and minima  appear with definite intervals. CCI corresponds to oscillators,  measuring speed of price fluctuations. The index demonstrates a  deflection of the ongoing price from its average value. Lambert  developed a constant at a level 0.015 that approximately from 70 up to  80 % of CCI values were between levels -100 and +100 -- for the purposes  of measurement.

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-analysis/technical-indicators/commodity-channel-index.htmlFollow-up

For the purposes of scaling, Lambert has installed a constant at a   level 0.015 that approximately from 70 up to 80 % of CCI values were   between levels -100 and +100.
http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ators/cci2.gif Chart:

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ators/cci7.png

The Commodity Channel Index  is moving over and under  a zero mark. The percent of Commodity Channel  Index values (between  +100 and -100) correspond to the number of the  periods used for its  building. Shorter - with smaller quantity of the  periods - CCI will be  more inconstant, and if less - its values will be  placed in a range  section between +100 and-100. Correspondingly, the  greater number of  periods will be used for CCI measurement, the more  values percent of the  indicator will be between the points of +100 and  -100.

The basic characteristic of the CCI named by the author is one-third   of full cycle. For instance, from a minimum up to an upcoming minimum or   from a maximum up to an upcoming maximum, or if a market movements'   cycle is thirty days, recommended value for CCI is ten days.

Important: The determination of the cycle's length doesn't depend on   the Commodity Channel Index and any other tools. It's is a rather   many-sided indicator which can cause a wide range of purchase or sell   signals. CCI is used both by investors and traders for determining of   reversal price points. It is extreme on the price chart and trend force   and its results should be used together from the rest of indicators.

How to use CCI

Here is the author's advice on the work with the CCI index in case it   moves above +100 and below-100 and sends sell or purchase signals. Buy  or sell signals happen 20 - 30 % of the time while from 70 up to 80 %   of time Commodity Channel Index's value is fluctuating between +100 and   -100. It's supposed that if CCI overcomes the level of +100 from below   upwards, it means that the currency pair is moving in the direction of   the strong ascending trend, thus there is a clear purchase signal. And   once CCI goes under +100 the position is supposed to be closed on a   return signal. At the same time, it's considered that if Commodity   Channel Index moves to -100 point from top to down, it means that the   currency pair is meeting a strong descending trend, and there's a sale   signal. As soon as CCI again crosses the level of -100 this position is   considered closed.

Later CCI started to work for determining if market is overbought or   oversold, for definition of reversal points. The currency pair is   considered overbought once it overcomes +100 level and is oversold once   CCI goes under -100 point. While CCI stays in an overbought position   which is above +100, the sale signal appears in case if CCI crosses a   level +100 in the opposite direction - from the peak to the bottom.   After CCI has entered into an oversold zone which is under -100 level,   the purchase signal appears when CCI crosses -100 point in the opposite   direction - from the bottom to the peak.

CCI is based on divergence analysis which widens a trading signal.   Positive discrepancy less than -100 increases the signal force when the   price crosses a level-100 from the bottom to the top. It happens only  if  there are 2 consecutive minima on CCI when the second minimum is  more  than the first one on the indicator but below the first one on the  chart  of prices. Negative divergence over +100 increases the signal  force  when CCI crosses +100 from top to bottom. The condition for this   situation is 2 consecutive maxima on the indicator above +100 when the   second maximum is under the first one on the indicator, but above on  the  chart of prices.

One can treat break of trend lines formed on the indicator as input   or output signals from a position. At overbought - above +100 - the   break of the trend line downwards is supposed a sale signal and at an   oversold level - below-100 - the break of the trend line upwards is   supposed a signal to growth of the market. Thus these lines are also   based on the connection of consecutive maxima or minima.

The drawbacks of Commodity Channel Index

The CCI works effectively only in cases when the market is really   subject to rather permanent cycles because it was developed definitely   for the cyclic markets. That's why it's more problematic to choose an   optimum period if Forex cycles are difficultly distinguished in market.  Caution: Every, even an irreproachable indicator used wrongly results in   a number of false signals and accordingly causes considerable losses  in  your deal. So before using any indicators on real accounts, first  test  their work for the demonstration account or check them as trading   strategy.

CCI Indikator

Geschrieben durch Staff Keine Komm.

Last Updated: June 9, 2010
http://www.forexonline.de/wp-content...ci-300x204.jpg

Der Indikator CCI – Commodity Channel Index – ist im  Forex sehr nützlich, da er uns erlaubt, die Deviation des statistisch  durchschnittlichen Preises zu messen. Der Indikator CCI kann zwei  verschiedene  Werte beinhalten:

wenn Der Indikator hoch ist, ist der laufende Preis höher als der  Durchschnittspreis. Wenn er dagegen tief ausfällt, bedeutet dies, dass  der laufende Preis unter dem  Durchschnittspreis liegt.

Um den CCI zu nutzen, kann man zwei verschiedene Techniken anwenden. Zuerst sollte man die Divergenz der  ICC-Werte bestimmen, umden  realen Marktpreis zu erreichen . Die Divergenz ensteht durch immer  wieder neu auftretende Preismaxima und -minima. Die Werte des CCI  hingegen folgen nicht dem Gesetz dieser periodischen Schwankungen. Wenn  folglich die CCI Werte sinken, während die Preise gleichzeitig ansteigen  und vice versa, ensteht hierbei die sogenannte Divergenz, die durchaus  ein Wechsel des Preisverlaufs anzeigen kann .

Die zweite Variante besteht darin, einen CCI Indikator als Hypergekauft oder Hyperverkauft-Indikator zu  verwenden. Normalerweise verfügen die Preise übr einen Wert zwischen  +100 und -100 des CCI -Wertes. Wenn der CCI Wert unter -100 liegt,  befinden wir uns  in einer Hyperverkauft -Situation. Dabei steigt der  Preis. Wenn hingegen der CCI Indikator über +100 liegt, befinden wir uns  in der  Hypergekauft -Situation. Der Trend ist dann rückläufig.

Die Handhabung  derartiger Indikatoren ist leicht. Die richtige Auswahl der jeweiligen Methode hängt von unserem Know-how ab.

Looks like it is  price in CCI, and you have edge there, because you can see 0 level from price and real oversold and overbought levels (100 & -100 or 200 & -200).

Is It Possible to Trade Forex on a Part-Time Basis with Success?

Currency trading is an exciting new market  for ambitious individuals who would like to test their skills in a  truly competitive environment with potentially very significant rewards.  It is not simple to become proficient in forex, you need to commit some  time, and make some effort in learning about and practicing trading,  before you achieve results that are favorable to any degree. This fact  sometimes scares potential traders to such an extent that they choose  not to entertain the idea of currency trading at all, due to time  limits, and the constraints of offline life. In this article, we are  going to take a look at the plausibility of a part-time forex trading  experience for the average person.

Perhaps the most exciting feature of the forex trading experience is  the almost unlimited degree of flexibility involved. The fractal nature  of charts means that, ignoring broker costs, trading at long or short  term is essentially the same business from the technical point of view. The fundamental point of view, on the other hand, implies that it is possible to apply  entirely different methods as a long or short term trader.

Thus one can be a part-time forex trader on both a long term and a  short term basis, but with different options available, and differing  approaches being necessary. A part-time short term trader must follow a  purely technical approach and apply money management methods with rigor  and discipline. In this case the time of entry does not matter that  much, but we strongly advise that periods of high volatility be avoided  unless one has an ample amount of time available to be devoted to the  absorbtion of the steady stream of news flooding the market. As such,  the part time trader would probably thrive when the market is calmer,  trading is subdued, and technical factors dominate, a scenario that is  most often encountered towards the closing hours of the market.

A long term part-time trader, on the other hand, must choose the  time for entry into the market very carefully. Since a position held on  the long term requires strong conviction and analysis, it is crucial  that a period of deep and thorough analysis precede the actual trading  action. The advantage of fundamental, long-term trading is in its  greater potential for very significant rewards, and also for reduced  risk, contrary to common assumptions. A long trader must use low  leverage since he is going to keep his position dormant for a long time,  and to have it survive volatility, high or even moderately high  leverage has to be avoided, which makes potential losses smaller,  provided that clear criteria exist for the closing of a position.

It is not really possible to decide which firm is more suitable to a part-time trading experience merely by reading online forex broker  reviews and going through ratings. You need to go and test the firm  actively for a period. The part-time trader demands a high degree of  accuracy and reliability from the broker because he can't afford to see  his trading platform fail during the comparatively infrequent periods  when he's online. So make your choices wisely; but part-time trading is  indeed a workable approach with some practice.

Hello juhanimi

Weekly EMA10 and EMA20 are parallel, and the last spinning tops before the actual candle after an bearish engulfing pattern say that bullish and bearish market players seems to be more in a tug of war at the moment. So the market don't know where to go.

May be we could see further little ups and downs (1.22 - 1.33).

Monthly EMA lines are coming more together and price moves between EMA100 and EMA200 (1.22 - 1.295).

So I would wait at daily chart if the spinning tops are forming further price patterns, as components e.g. of Morning Star, Evening Star, Haramis, Hammers, Shooting Star...and would prefere to trade at M15/H1.

Of cours Daily CI(14) is over 100 but EMA Lines are going parallel, say without momentum at the time.

So may be it's better to trade M30/H1. I would do so.

See also price patterns at the monthly chart, please. If monhtly candle would forming an inside bar this month then it could be a confirmation for the engulfing pattern and we could seen higher prices, so the Euro will getting stronger.

Hope it helps.

If MS3 1.5344 will be broken downwards then go short. EMA100 at 1.5328

EMA lines are coming more parallel and so market seems to be moves in ups and downs till momentum getting stronger for making  the next beakout. In the meantime I would prefere to trade the range box with H1 and H4 and at shorter time frames several descening or ascending shorter trendlines .

It seems that there might be other currency pairs more attractive for a bigger investment. Why to invest in an indifferent euro, when other currency pair shows clearer signals? Why do invest the money in some currency pairs with a more comfortabe risk-reward ratio, isn't it?. European shares seems also to be at his average level.

Price Action: The Perfect Forex Trading System

Trading the Forex market has become  very popular in the last few years. But how difficult is it to achieve  success in the Forex trading arena? Or let me rephrase this question,  how many traders achieve consistent profitable results trading the Forex  market? Unfortunately very few, only 5% of traders achieve this goal.  One of the main reasons of this is because Forex traders focus in the  wrong information to make their trading decisions and totally forget  about the most important factor: Price behavior.

Most Forex trading systems are made  off technical indicators (a moving average (MA) crossover,  overbought/oversold conditions in an oscillator, etc.) But what are  technical indicators? They are just a series of data points plotted in a  chart; these points are derived from a mathematical formula applied to  the price of any given currency pair.  In other words, it is a chart of  price plotted in a different way that helps us see other aspects of  price.

There is an important implication on  this definition of technical indicators. The fact that the readings  obtained from them are based on price action. Take for instance a long  MA crossover signal, the price has gone up enough to make the short  period MA crossover the long period MA generating a long signal. Most  traders see it as “the MA crossover made the price go up,” but it  happened the other way around, the MA crossover signal occurred because  the price went up. Where I’m trying to get here is that at the end,  price behavior dictates how an indicator will act, and this should be  taken into consideration on any trading decision made.

Trading decisions based on technical  indicators without taking price action into consideration will give us  less accurate results. For example, again a long signal generated by a  MA crossover as the market approaches an important resistance level. If  the price suddenly starts to bounce back off that important level there  is no point on taking this signal, price action is telling us the market  doesn’t want to go up.  Most of the time, under this circumstances, the  market will continue to fall down, disregarding the MA crossover.

Don’t get me wrong here, technical  indicators are a very important aspect of trading. They help us see  certain conditions that are otherwise difficult to see by watching pure  price action. But when it comes to pull the trigger, price action  incorporation into our Forex trading system will definitely put the odds  in our favor, it will generate higher probability trades.

So, how to create a perfect Forex trading system?

First of all, you need to make sure  your trading system fits your trading personality; otherwise you will  find it hard to follow it. Every trader has different needs and goals,  thus there is no system that perfectly fits all traders. You need to  make your own research on various trading styles and technical  indicators until you find a concept that perfectly works for you. Make  sure you know the nature of whatever technical indicator used.

Secondly, incorporate price action  into your system. So you only take long signals if the price behavior  tells you the market wants to go up, and short signals if the market  gives you indication that it will go down.

Third, and most importantly, you need  to have the discipline to follow your Forex trading system rigorously.  Try it first on a demo account, then move on to a small account and  finally when feeling comfortably and being consistent profitable apply  your system in a regular account.

You need to make sure  your trading system fits your trading personality.

What is Price Action?

Price action is  essentially the closest relative to order flow in FX and across all  markets. It is the direct result of the order flow. Thus, it has the  fingerprints of bias, speed of buying/selling, where buying and selling  is occurring (support/resistance) when a breakout is genuine and where a  likely reversal is occurring. From the continuous flow of price action  which pours onto our charts, all indicators are born and thus dependent  upon it. Hence, understanding and being able to interpret price action  becomes an essential component to our trading. It is a way to get into  the essence behind what creates the indicators and most technical  signals in the markets.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
What Does Price Action Mean?

The  movement of a security's price. Price action is encompassed in  technical and chart pattern analysis, which attempt to find order in the  sometimes seemingly random movement of price. Swings (high and low),  tests of resistance and consolidation are some examples of price action.

The candlestick and price bar are important tools for analyzing  price action, since they help traders visualize of price movement.  Candlestick patterns such as the Harami, engulfing pattern and cross are  all examples of visually interpreted price action.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg
Investopedia explains Price Action

No  two people will analyze every bit of price action the same way, and  that is why a lot of traders find the concept of price action so  elusive. Quite literally, price action is everything that a security's  price does, and just like every other facet of analysis, it is purely  subjective.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
What Does Downtrend Mean?

Describes the price movement of a financial  asset when the overall direction is downward. A formal downtrend occurs  when each successive peak and trough is lower than the ones found  earlier in the trend.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictio.../downtrend.GIF

Notice  how each successive peak and trough is lower than the previous one. For  example, the low at Point 3 is lower than the low at Point 1. The  downtrend will be deemed broken once the price closes above the high at  Point 4.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
What does Bollinger Band mean?

A band plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average, developed by famous technical trader John Bollinger.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictio...lingerband.gif

In  this example of Bollinger bands, the price of the stock is banded by an  upper and lower band along with a 21-day simple moving average.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg

Investopedia explains Bollinger Band

Because  standard deviation is a measure of volatility, Bollinger bands adjust  themselves to the market conditions. When the markets become more  volatile, the bands widen (move further away from the average), and  during less volatile periods, the bands contract (move closer to the  average). The tightening of the bands is often used by technical traders  as an early indication that the volatility is about to increase  sharply.

This is one of the most popular technical analysis  techniques. The closer the prices move to the upper band, the more  overbought the market, and the closer the prices move to the lower band,  the more oversold the market.

Die BollingerBänder

Entstehung

Die BollingerBänder (Bollinger Bands) wurden von John Bollinger  von Bollinger Capital Management Anfang der 80ziger Jahre als Indikator  erfunden und gehören mittlerweile zum Standard-Werkzeug der  TechnischenAnalyse.

Seine Idee wurde durch das statistischen Phänomen der Häufung in  der Mitte (goldene Mitte) angeregt, da in normalverteilten Wertegruppen  sich eine bestimmte Menge an Werten mit einer bestimmten  Wahrscheinlichkeit befindet, die um einen festen Betrag von einem  Mittelwert abweichen. Daraus lässt sich ableiten, dass innerhalb eines Kanals sich alle Kurse  befinden müssen, da sie nur begrenzt weit vom Mittelwert  (Gleitender-Durchschnitt=MA) notieren können. Hierbei werden BreakOuts  (geringe Prozentzahl<=5%) vernachlässigt. Der (Gauss´schen)  Normalverteilung wird die Standardabweichung gebildet: es wird die  Schwankungsbreite gebildet, d.h. in wie weit der Kurs historisch um den  20-Tage-Durchschnitt geschwankt hat.

Anwendung

Hauptanwendungsgebiet der BollingerBänder sind Aktien: hier wird  versucht durch die entstandenen Bänder innerhalb dieser zu traden  (Kanaltrading). Auch werden Ausbrüche aus den Bändern getradet.

Beschreibung

Bollinger Bänder sind "Umhüllungslinien" des Kursverlaufs: sie  umhüllen den Kursverlauf Basiswertes (Underlyings) mit einem variablen  Abstand. Somit ergibt sich jeweils ein Band oberhalb und unterhalb des Kurses.  Innerhalb dieser Bänder bewegt sich der Kurs. Der Abstand zwischen dem  Kurs und einem BollingerBand wird als Spannbreite verstanden.

Die BollingerBänder bauen auf einem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt  (Moving Average=MA) auf und geben die Marktvolatilität als Abstände nach  oben und unten zum Kursverlauf wieder. Somit resultieren die Bänder aus  einer Spanne von 2 Standardabweichungen über und unter dem  Gleitenden-Durchschnitt. Der Abstand der Bänder voneinander in Relation mit der  Gleitenden-Durchschnittslinie steht somit in Abhängigkeit zu der  aktuellen Schwankungsbreite des Underlyings/Basiswertes. Die Bänder verwenden also Maß für die Verschiebung die  Standardabweichung, um die Volatilität des Underlyings wiederzuspiegeln  und grenzen so die zu erwartenden Kursschwankungen ein. Die Entfernung zu der Gleitenden-Durchschnittslinie beträgt als Standard  die 2-fache Standardabweichung der Periode. Man erhält zwei Kurven, indem man die Standardabweichung zu dem  Gleitenden-Durchschnitt (20-Tage) hinzuaddiert und subtrahiert.

Die BollingerBänder sind somit sehr einfach: Sie bauen auf einem  Gleitenden-Durchschnitt auf, der um je zwei Standardabweichungen nach  oben und unten verschoben wird.

Dieser Ansatz ist bereits von den Envelopes bekannt. Jedoch  verwenden die Envelopes einen feststehenden Prozentsatz für die  Abweichung/Verschiebung, während hingegen die BollingerBänder variabel  sind. Die Variabilität ergibt sich aus der Schwankungsbreite, so dass sich die  Bänder individuell dem Underlying/ Basiswert anpassen. Dies ist das  besondere an den BollingerBändern, im Gegensatz zu den  Indikatoren,Oszillatoren u. Envelopes: die BollingerBänder sind  selbstadjustierend.

Statistisch gesehen, liegen 95% der Kurse innerhalb der  BollingerBänder (2-fache Standardabweichung), genau darauf bauen die  Trading-Ansätze auf. Bei der einfachen Standardabweichung beträgt der Prozentsatz 70%, dieser  wird aber kaum verwendet.

Standard Einstellungen

-Periode zwischen 20-21 Tage (arithmetischer Gleitender-Durchschnitt)

Weitere Einstellungen

-Periode bis zu 50 Tagen -schnellere Reaktionszeit: Exponentieller-Durchschnitt -verlangsamtere Reaktionszeit: Geglätteter-Durchschnitt

Berechnung

Oberes BollingerBand = MA + 2s Mittleres BollingerBand = MA (eigentlich kein Band, sondern der MA auf dem die Berechnung aufbaut) Unteres BollingerBand = MA -2s

Trading-Ansatz...

... Perioden geringer Volatilität

Bei geringer Volatilität liegen die Bänder sehr eng beieinander,  da der Kurs und somit der Gleitende-Durchschnitt langsam seitwärts  tendiert (geringe Standardabweichung/Volatilität). Mit einem baldigen Ausbruch (short/long) kann gerechnet werden, da die  Wahrscheinlichkeit einer starken Preisbewegung wächst.

http://www.aktienboard.com/mw/images...Bollinger1.gif

... Perioden mit Volatilität

Da der Kurs sich zu 95% innerhalb der BollingerBänder bewegt,  kann man sein Trading anhand der Umkehrpunkte innerhalb der Bänder  ausrichten, da der Kurs sich zwischen den Bändern schwankt. Der Kurse bewegt sich normalerweise von einem Band zum anderen Band. Umkehrpunkte befinden sich jeweils an dem oberen u. unteren Rand  BollingerBand.

Umkehrpunkte befinden sich auch innerhalb der Mitte der Bänder  (ähnlich wie bei den TradingRanges: MiddleRange), sind jedoch nicht  allzu zuverlässig.

... Top/Bottom Bildung an den Bändern

Bildet sich in der Nähe (außerhalb/innerhalb) eines Band ein  Top/Bottom als extreme Punkte wiederholen, so ist dies als Anzeichen für  eine bevorstehende Trendwende zu werten.

... Ausbruch aus den Bändern

Hier kann der Ausbruch (Schlußkurs außerhalb der Bänder) als  FalseBreak/Fehlausbruch behandelt werden. Da sich der Kurs zu 95%  innerhalb der BollingerBänder bewegt, ist mit einem baldigen  Wiedereintritt in die BollingerBänder zu rechnen. Ein Ausbruch aus den Bändern stellt daher im Regelfall eine extreme  Übertreibung dar, die kurzfristig korrigiert werden sollte: man traded  die Bewegung in Richtung der Ausbruchsstelle. Diese Gegenbewegung ist erst beendet, wenn der Kurs wieder in die  BollingerBänder eintaucht.

http://www.aktienboard.com/mw/images...Bollinger2.gif

Allerdings sind die restlichen 5% beachten: der starke  Kursausbruch kann auch auf eine längere Auf-/Abwärtsbewegung hindeuten  (solange, bis der Gleitende-Durchschnitt mit seinen BollingerBänder  wieder nachzieht/korrigiert).

... steigenden/fallenden BollingerBändern

Steigende/Fallende BollingerBänder können als  Trendfolge-Indikator genutzt werden und zeigen einen  Aufwärts-/Abwärtstrend an. Die Kurse erreichen dann kaum das jeweils  andere Band, sondern schwanken nur zwischen dem Gleitenden-Durchschnitt  u. dem oberen Band (im Aufwärtstrend) oder dem unteren Band (im  Abwärtstrend).

Bollinger Bands

Introduction

Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. Volatility is based on the standard deviation, which changes a volatility increase and decreases. The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases. This dynamic nature of Bollinger Bands also means they can be used on different securities with the standard settings. For signals, Bollinger Bands can be used to identify M-Tops and W-Bottoms or to determine the strength of the trend. Signals derived from narrowing BandWidth are discussed in the chart school article on BandWidth.

SharpCharts Calculation

* Middle Band = 20-day simple moving average (SMA)

* Upper Band = 20-day SMA + (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)

* Lower Band = 20-day SMA - (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-sprdsheet.png
Click here for download this spreadsheet example.

Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands. The middle band is a simple moving average  that is usually set at 20 periods. A simple moving average is used  because a simple moving average is also used in the standard deviation  formula. The look-back period for the standard deviation is the same as  for the simple moving average. The outer bands are usually set 2 standard deviations above and below the middle band.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-1-spyexam.png

Settings can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of particular securities or trading styles. Bollinger  recommends making small incremental adjustments to the standard  deviation multiplier. Changing the number of periods for the moving  average also affects the number of periods used to calculate the  standard deviation. Therefore, only small adjustments are required for  the standard deviation multiplier.  An increase in the  moving average period would automatically increase the number of periods  used to calculate the standard deviation and would also warrant an  increase in the standard deviation multiplier. With a 20-day SMA and 20-day Standard Deviation, the standard deviation multiplier is set at 2. Bollinger  suggests increasing the standard deviation multiplier to 2.1 for a  50-period SMA and decreasing the standard deviation multiplier to 1.9  for a 10-period SMA.

Signal: W-Bottoms

W-Bottoms were part of Arthur Merrill's work that identified 16 patterns with a basic W shape. Bollinger uses these various W patterns with Bollinger Bands to identify W-Bottoms. A "W-Bottom" forms in a downtrend and involves two reaction lows. In particular, Bollinger looks for W-Bottoms where the second low is lower than the first, but holds above the lower band. There are four steps to confirm a W-Bottom with Bollinger Bands. First, a reaction low forms. This low is usually, but not always, below the lower band. Second, there is a bounce towards the middle band. Third, there is a new price low in the security this low holds above the lower band. The ability to hold above the lower band  on the test shows less weakness on the last decline. Fourth, the  pattern is confirmed with a strong move off the second low and a  resistance break.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-2-jwnwbot.png

Chart 2 shows Nordstrom (JWN) with a W-Bottom in January-February 2010.  First, the stock formed a reaction low in January (black arrow) and  broke below the lower band. Second, there was a bounce back above the middle band. Third, the stock moved below its January low and held above the lower band. Even though the 5-Feb spike low broke the lower band, Bollinger Bands  are calculated using closing prices so signals should also be based on  closing prices. Fourth, the stock surged with expanding volume in late  February and broke above the early February high. Chart 3 shows Sandisk  with a smaller W-Bottom in July-August 2009.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...3-sndkwbot.png

Signal: M-Tops

M-Tops were also part of Arthur Merrills work that identified 16 patterns with a basic M shape. Bollinger uses these various M patterns with Bollinger Bands to identify M Bottoms. According to Bollinger,  tops are usually more complicated and drawn out than bottoms. Double  tops, head-and-shoulders patterns and diamonds represent evolving tops.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Follow-up:
http://stockcharts.com/help/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands

In its most basic form, an M-Top is similar to a double top. However,  the reaction highs are not always equal. The first high can be higher or  lower than the second high. Bollinger  suggests looking for signs of non-confirmation when a security is making  new highs. This is basically the opposite of the W-Bottom. A  non-confirmation occurs with three steps. First, a security forges a  reaction high above the upper band. Second, there is a pullback towards the middle band. Third, prices move above the prior high, but fail to reach the upper band. This is a warning sign. The inability of the second reaction high to reach the upper band  shows waning momentum, which can foreshadow a trend reversal. Final  confirmation comes with a support break or bearish indicator signal.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-4-xommtop.png

Chart 4 shows Exxon Mobil (XOM) with an M-Top in April-May 2008. The stock moved above the upper band in April. There was a pullback in May and then another push above 90. Even though the stock moved above the upper band on an intraday basis, it did not CLOSE above the upper band.  The M-Top was confirmed with a support break two weeks later. Also  notice that MACD formed a bearish divergence and moved below its signal  line for confirmation.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-5-phmmtop.png

Chart 5 shows Pulte Homes (PHM) within an uptrend in July-August 2008. Price exceeded the upper band in early September to affirm the uptrend. After a pullback below the 20-day SMA (middle Bollinger Band), the stock moved to a higher high above 17. Despite this new high for the move, price did not exceed the upper band.  This flashed a warning sign. The stock broke support a week later and  MACD moved below its signal line. Notice that this M-top is more complex  because there are lower reaction highs on either side of the peak (blue  arrow). This evolving top formed a small head-and-shoulders pattern.

Signal: Walking the Bands

Moves above or below the bands are not signals per se. As Bollinger puts it, moves that touch or exceed the bands are not signals, but rather "tags".  On the face of it, a move to the upper band shows strength, while a sharp move to the lower band  shows weakness. Momentum oscillators work much the same way. Overbought  is not necessarily bullish. It takes strength to reach overbought  levels and overbought conditions can extend in a strong uptrend.  Similarly, prices can "walk the band" with numerous touches during a strong uptrend. Think about it for a moment. The upper band is 2 standard deviations above the 20-period simple moving average. It takes a pretty strong price move to exceed this upper band. An upper band touch that occurs after a Bollinger Band confirmed W-Bottom would signal the start of an uptrend. Just as a strong uptrend produces numerous upper band tags, it is also common for prices to never reach the lower band  during an uptrend. The 20-day SMA sometimes acts as support. In fact,  dips below the 20-day SMA sometimes provide buying opportunities before  the next tag of the upper band.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-6-apdwalk.png

Chart 6 shows Air Products (APD) with a surge and close above the upper band  in mid July. First, notice that this is a strong surge that broke above  two resistance levels. A strong upward thrust is a sign of strength,  not weakness. Trading turned flat in August and the 20-day SMA moved  sideways. The Bollinger Bands narrowed, but APD did not close below the lower band. Prices, and the 20-day SMA, turned up in September. Overall, APD closed above the upper band  at least five times over a four month period. The indicator window  shows the 10-period Commodity Channel Index (CCI). Dips below -100 are  deemed oversold and moves back above -100 signal the start of an  oversold bounce (green dotted line). The upper band  tag and breakout started the uptrend. CCI then identified tradable  pullbacks with dips below -100. This is an example of combining Bollinger Bands with a momentum oscillator for trading signals.

http://stockcharts.com/school/data/m...-7-monwalk.png

Chart 7 shows Monsanto (MON) with a walk down the lower band. The stock broke down in January with a support break and closed below the lower band. From mid January until early May, Monsanto closed below the lower band at least five times. Notice that the stock did not close above the upper band once during this period. The support break and initial close below the lower band  signaled a downtrend. As such, the 10-period Commodity Channel Index  (CCI) was used to identify short-term overbought situations. A move  above +100 is overbought. A move back below +100 signals a resumption of  the downtrend (red arrows). This system triggered two good signals in  early 2010.

Conclusions

Bollinger Bands reflect direction with the 20-period SMA and volatility with the upper/lower bands. As such, they can be used to determine if prices are relatively high or low. According to Bollinger, the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, which makes a move outside the bands significant. Technically, prices are relatively high when above the upper band and relatively low when below the lower band.  However, relatively high should not be regarded as bearish or as a sell  signal. Likewise, relatively low should not be considered bullish or as  a buy signal. Prices are high or low for a reason. As with other  indicators, Bollinger Bands are not meant to be used as a stand alone tool. Chartists should combine Bollinger Bands with basic trend analysis and other indicators for confirmation.

Bands and SharpCharts

Bollinger Bands can be found in SharpCharts as a price overlay. As with a simple moving average, Bollinger Bands should be shown on top of a price plot. Upon selecting Bollinger Bands,  the default setting will appear in the parameters window (20,2). The  first number (20) sets the periods for the simple moving average and the  standard deviation. The second number (2) sets the standard deviation  multiplier for the upper and lower bands. These default parameters set the bands 2 standard deviations above/below the simple moving average. Users can change the parameters to suit their charting needs. Bollinger Bands (50,2.1) can be used for a longer timeframe or Bollinger Bands (10,1.9) can be used for a shorter timeframe.

Hello mrhb30jr

Great chart! I like it!

Besides pin bars you could take a look at inside bars, too, (which "bit9ret" has introduced at p.25,  #371; p.25, #375) as a confirmation to the pin bars (e.g. hammers and shooting stars, may be hanging man, too), at least you've got one more powerful argument in addition.

H4 candles have forming a bullish engulfing pattern.

I would prefere with Enter Long at 1.013 with 3 positions* and then with 3 more positions at 1.00. If price are falling under 1.0 Enter Long with 2 more positions and around 0.98 with 2 positions, or so.

If the actual last H4 candle (spinning top) turned further downwards (and not over the the middle line of Bollinger Band),... it don't confirm the bullish engulfing pattern, ...you could hedge some positions downwards at a lower timeframe (M15/M30) by holding the Enter Long trades in the market. So would I do!

Lowest price (monthly chart) was at 0.96380 at 2008.03.01. Between 0.98 and 0.965 again with several positions Enter Long (max. 5-10) even more to pick up the higher chance of a turn around.

If so there would be 1.5 to 2 full trades in the market (1.5 - 2 Lot, say 15 - 20 positions).

*Position trading

If a trade would be 1 Lot so divide it by 10 and these are the positions.

1 Lot = 10 positions.

Hope it helps!

Sincerely,

FXcube

Here you see when you don't trade with Stop Loss a worse scenario snapshot.

You'll see that in the next weeks all open trades will running in the win, may be tomorrow, may be next week, may be next month, we don't know! It's only the drawback of my art of Non-Stop-Loss Trading, which you make allowance for the money management. Sure, I have to go with some hedging positions at short term charts down. But this is also for demonstrating. May be the end of the losses aren't reached and if no hedging ones would be made then further minus floating could follow. I have a great trust in my own market analysis and in my unorthodox money and risk management. So for me it's okay!,...may be not for you. That is the point who every forex trader have to trade in his own characteristic, and it would be fine when you will work out yours!

Interim Result:
Floating Loss : -17'025.55$

With this "Floating Loss : -17'025.55$" - Example I will demonstrade that 95-99% of all open trades would run in his win sooner or later and a part of this would several times hedged. So I ask you "Why should you destroy these open losses trades with a stop loss too early?" Make really no sense for me! You give too early good money your broker!, ...moreover ...and abdicate responsibility to early. I wouldn't do so.

Sequentially I assess the value of the following comments as useless and misleading.

"Limit your losses

Stop/loss  commands also follow the same motive as that  of the limit orders, by allowing  the investors to set an exit point for  a loss. By limiting your losses to a pre  set position, Stop/loss  orders help investors control their risk conditions. By  placing them  well in advance, you have an almost accurate idea of how much in  loss  will you be, in case the stop/loss order is hit!"

When I read such nonsense I can only say:

Oh snap!

95-99% of all the open minus trades ("Floating Loss : -17'025.55$") are Tops and wait for their transfer in the break even area!

Trading without Stop-Loss

These things to know about Forex Comprehending  all the intricacies of the basics behind  an investment, and understanding behind  the major market trading, is  the right way to go about trading Forex. Skilled  technical analysis and  good money management skills are the basic essentials to  trade well.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I use this Non Stop Loss Concept in association with the Position Trading, an incremental representation by 10.

Example: Someone deals ordinary with 1 Lot per trade. So this trade has now 10 positions and he have to go in the trade now e.g. with two tenths or three tenth of its normal size, say only with 2 - 3 positions.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Both new and experienced traders make good and bad trades over a long  period of time. The difference between them is that the more experienced  trader has a grasp of the importance of risk management as an integral  part of a successful Forex trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Proper risk management can maximize the positive and minimize the negative aspects of the regular ups and downs of trading.

...and this means for me a trading without stopp loss!

Risk Management in Forex Trading is recommended for traders who like the Stop Loss Trading Style.

http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Risk_Management_in_Forex_Trading

Risk Management in Forex Trading

Even the best trading strategy can falter from time to time, however, without good risk management,  a small loss could turn into an account-ending margin call. Risk  Management simply refers to any effort taken to mitigate uncertainty in a  trade.
Know Your Exit Even Before You Enter

From the collective wisdom of the market, one rule always seems to  top the list of essential money management commandments: placing stops. A  stop loss is merely a level at which a trader will exit a trade that is  going against them. This level can be mental or a hard stop—with an  order set to automatically exit when spot reaches a certain price. In  general, a hard stop will almost always be preferable as it removes the  hazard of emotion seeping into a trade and adjusting an otherwise sound  trading strategy. However, there are situations where the mental  component can be useful. There are two core types of stops in the forex  market -   Money stop Indicator stop.   Money Stop

The money stop is the most commonly used exit strategy in the  investment world. This level is based on a predefined amount of capital a  trader is willing to risk on each trade. By deciding how much a trade  could potentially lose at the outset, a market participant can survive  to trade another day should one position fail. While this stop is  primarily calculated as a specific percentage of total capital, or  perhaps it is chosen as just a random number, we can also take  technicals into consideration when defining the exit level. To show how  all of this comes together, we can take as an example a hypothetical  trade in EUR/USD.  With a bullish outlook on the pair, we could have entered the market  when price was testing a rising trendline around 1.5525. With a  predetermined level of acceptable risk of 150 pips or $1,500 for a  standard account[1], we would set our stop at 1.5375[1]—well below the rising trendline.

http://www.wikinvest.com/images/thum...Management.png

Entry and Indicator Stop

Indicator Stop

Another popular exit strategy is the indicator stop. Unlike the other  two stops, which rely predominately on underlying price action, this  method uses a technical indicator, alone or in conjunction with spot, to  define an exit. This can entail an indicator reaching a certain level,  two indicators crossing, or price action interacting with the indicator  as a means for gauging an exit point. heoretically, there are unlimited   possibilities for incorporating technicals into a stop policy—ranging  from very complicated to extremely simple. One of the most common  indicator stops for nearly every market is using a moving average as a  self-adjusted stop loss. Here is an example of using the 100-hour SMA as  an exit tool for the EUR/USD. Suppose a trader goes long the EUR/USD on  a close above the 100-hour SMA. The trader can then proceed to trail  the stop using the moving average and only exit the position when price  closes back below the SMA. In this example, the long trade is taken at  1.55 and not closed until 1.5750[1].  The only caveat is that this method of a stop does not work well with  set orders, so the trader will need to keep an eye on the technical  indicator.

http://www.wikinvest.com/images/thum...anagement2.png

Having  a stop and sticking with it is the most fundamental rule of trading  that separates disciplined traders  from undisciplined ones.

Good Luck!

Understanding Forex Risk Management

by Selwyn Gishen                                                        (Contact Author | Biography)

Trading is the exchange of goods or services between two or more  parties. So if you need gasoline for your car, then you would trade your  dollars for gasoline. In the old days, and still in some societies,  trading was done by barter, where one commodity was swapped for  another. A trade may have gone like this: Person A will fix Person B's  broken window in exchange for a basket of apples from Person B's tree.  This is a practical, easy to manage, day-to-day example of making a  trade, with relatively easy management of risk. In order to lessen the  risk, Person A might ask Person B to show his apples, to make sure they  are good to eat, before fixing the window. This is how trading has been  for millennia: a practical, thoughtful human process.

This is Now

Now enter  the world wide web and all of a sudden risk can become completely out of  control, in part due to the speed at which a transaction can take  place. In fact, the speed of the transaction, the instant gratification  and the adrenalin rush of making a profit in less than 60 seconds can  often trigger a gambling instinct, to which many traders may succumb.  Hence, they might turn to online trading as a form of gambling rather  than approaching trading as a professional business that requires proper  speculative habits. (Learn more in Are You Investing Or Gambling?)

Speculating  as a trader is not gambling. The difference between gambling and  speculating is risk management. In other words, with speculating, you  have some kind of control over your risk, whereas with gambling you  don't. Even a card game such as Poker can be played with either the  mindset of a gambler or with the mindset of a speculator, usually with  totally different outcomes.

Betting Strategies
There are three basic ways to take a bet: Martingale, anti-Martingale or speculative. Speculation comes from the Latin word "speculari," meaning to spy out or look forward.

In  a Martingale strategy, you would double-up your bet each time you lose,  and hope that eventually the losing streak will end and you will make a  favorable bet, thereby recovering all your losses and even making a  small profit.

Using an anti-Martingale strategy, you would halve  your bets each time you lost, but would double your bets each time you  won. This theory assumes that you can capitalize on a winning streak and  profit accordingly. Clearly, for online traders, this is the better of  the two strategies to adopt. It is always less risky to take your losses  quickly and add or increase your trade size when you are winning.

However, no trade should be taken without first stacking the odds in  your favor, and if this is not clearly possible then no trade should be  taken at all. (For more on the Martingale method, read FX Trading The Martingale Way.)

Know the Odds

So, the first rule in risk  management is to calculate the odds of your trade being successful. To  do that, you need to grasp both fundamental and technical analysis.  You will need to understand the dynamics of the market in which you are  trading, and also know where the likely psychological price trigger  points are, which a price chart can help you decide.

Once a decision is made to take the trade then the next most  important factor is in how you control or manage the risk. Remember, if  you can measure the risk, you can, for the most part, manage it.

In stacking the odds in your favor, it is important to draw a line in  the sand, which will be your cut out point if the market trades to that  level. The difference between this cut-out point and where you enter  the market is your risk. Psychologically, you must accept this risk  upfront before you even take the trade. If you can accept the potential  loss, and you are OK with it, then you can consider the trade further.  If the loss will be too much for you to bear, then you must not take the  trade or else you will be severely stressed and unable to be objective  as your trade proceeds.

Since risk is the opposite side of the coin to reward, you should  draw a second line in the sand, which is where, if the market trades to  that point, you will move your original cut-out line to secure your  position. This is known as sliding your stops. This second line is the  price at which you break even if the market cuts you out at that point.  Once you are protected by a break-even stop, your risk has virtually  been reduced to zero, as long as the market is very liquid and you know  your trade will be executed at that price. Make sure you understand the  difference between stop orders, limit orders and market orders.

Liquidity
The next risk factor to study is liquidity.  Liquidity means that there are a sufficient number of buyers and  sellers at current prices to easily and efficiently take your trade. In  the case of the forex markets, liquidity, at least in the major  currencies, is never a problem. This liquidity is known as market  liquidity, and in the spot cash forex market, it accounts for some $2 trillion per day in trading volume.

However, this liquidity is not necessarily available to all brokers  and is not the same in all currency pairs. It is really the broker  liquidity that will affect you as a trader. Unless you trade directly  with a large forex dealing bank,  you most likely will need to rely on an online broker to hold your  account and to execute your trades accordingly. Questions relating to  broker risk are beyond the scope of this article, but large, well-known  and well capitalized brokers should be fine for most retail online  traders, at least in terms of having sufficient liquidity to effectively  execute your trade.

Risk per Trade
Another aspect of risk is determined by how much trading capital  you have available. Risk per trade should always be a small percentage  of your total capital. A good starting percentage could be 2% of your  available trading capital. So, for example, if you have $5000 in your  account, the maximum loss allowable should be no more than 2%. With  these parameters your maximum loss would be $100 per trade. A 2% loss  per trade would mean you can be wrong 50 times in a row before you wipe  out your account. This is an unlikely scenario if you have a proper  system for stacking the odds in your favor.

So how do we actually measure the risk?

The way to measure risk per trade is by using your price chart. This is best demonstrated by looking at a chart as follows:

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl.../RiskMGMT1.gif

Figure 1: EUR/USD One-Hour Time Frame                               Chart by Netdania.com

We have already determined that our first line in the sand (stop loss)  should be drawn where we would cut out of the position if the market  traded to this level. The line is set at 1.3534. To give the market a  little room, I would set the stop loss to 1.3530. (Learn more about stop  losses in The Art Of Selling A Losing Position.) A good place to enter the position would be at 1.3580, which, in this  example, is just above the high of the hourly close after a an attempt  to form a triple bottom failed. The difference between this entry point  and the exit point is therefore 50 pips. If you are trading with $5,000  in your account, you would limit your loss to the 2% of your trading capital, which is $100.

Let's assume you are trading mini lots.  If one pip in a mini lot is equal to approximately $1 and your risk is  50 pips then, for each lot you trade, you are risking $50. You could  trade one or two mini lots and keep your risk to between $50-100. You  should not trade more than three mini lots in this example, if you do  not wish to violate your 2% rule.

Leverage
The next big risk magnifier is leverage.  Leverage is the use of the bank's or broker's money rather than the  strict use of your own. The spot forex market is a very leveraged  market, in that you could put down a deposit of just $1,000 to actually  trade $100,000. This is a 100:1 leverage factor. A one pip loss in a  100:1 leveraged situation is equal to $10. So if you had 10 mini lots in  the trade, and you lost 50 pips, your loss would be $500, not $50.

However, one of the big benefits of trading the spot forex markets is  the availability of high leverage. This high leverage is available  because the market is so liquid that it is easy to cut out of a position  very quickly and, therefore, easier compared with most other markets to  manage leveraged positions. Leverage of course cuts two ways. If you  are leveraged and you make a profit, your returns are magnified very  quickly but, in the converse, losses will erode your account just as  quickly too. (See Leverage's "Double-Edged Sword" Need Not Cut Deep for more.)

But of all the risks inherent in a trade, the hardest risk to manage,  and by far the most common risk blamed for trader loss, is the bad  habit patterns of the trader himself.

All traders have to take responsibility for their own decisions. In  trading, losses are part of the norm, so a trader must learn to accept  losses as part of the process. Losses are not failures. However, not  taking a loss quickly is a failure of proper trade management. Usually a  trader, when his position moves into a loss, will second guess his  system and wait for the loss to turn around and for the position to  become profitable. This is fine for those occasions when the market does  turn around, but it can be a disaster when the loss gets worse. (Learn  to overcome this big hurdle in Master Your Trading Mindtraps.)

The solution to trader risk is to work on your own habits and to be  honest enough to acknowledge the times when your ego gets in the way of  making the right decisions or when you simply can't manage the  instinctive pull of a bad habit.

The best way to objectify your trading is by keeping a journal of  each trade, noting the reasons for entry and exit and keeping score of  how effective your system is. In other words how confident are you that  your system provides a reliable method in stacking the odds in your  favor and thus provide you with more profitable trade opportunities than  potential losses.

Conclusion

Risk is inherent in every trade you  take, but as long as you can measure risk you can manage it. Just don't  overlook the fact that risk can be magnified by using too much leverage  in respect to your trading capital as well as being magnified by a lack  of liquidity in the market. With a disciplined approach and good trading  habits, taking on some risk is the only way to generate good rewards.

Forex risk management strategies

Learn about the basic strategies for controlling risks while trading Forex

The  Forex market behaves differently from other markets! The speed,  volatility, and enormous size of the Forex market are unlike anything  else in the financial world. Beware: the Forex market is uncontrollable -  no single event, individual, or factor rules it. Enjoy trading in the  perfect market! Just like any other speculative business, increased risk  entails chances for a higher profit/loss.

Currency markets are highly speculative and volatile in nature. Any currency can become  very expensive or very cheap in relation to any or all other currencies  in a matter of days, hours, or sometimes, in minutes. This unpredictable  nature of the currencies is what attracts an investor to trade and  invest in the currency market.

But ask yourself,  "How much am I ready to lose?" When you terminated, closed or exited  your position, had you had understood the risks and taken steps to avoid  them? Let's look at some foreign exchange risk management issues that  may come up in your day-to-day foreign exchange transactions. Unexpected corrections in currency exchange rates Wild variations in foreign exchange rates Volatile markets offering profit opportunities Lost payments Delayed confirmation of payments and receivables Divergence between bank drafts received and the contract price

There are areas that every trader should cover both BEFORE and DURING a trade.

Exit the Forex market at profit targetsLimit  orders, also known as profit take orders, allow Forex traders to exit  the Forex market at pre-determined profit targets. If you are short  (sold) a currency pair, the system will only allow you to place a limit  order below the current market price because this is the profit zone.  Similarly, if you are long (bought) the currency pair, the system will  only allow you to place a limit order above the current market price.  Limit orders help create a disciplined trading methodology and make it  possible for traders to walk away from the computer without continuously  monitoring the market.

Control risk by capping lossesStop/loss  orders allow traders to set an exit point for a losing trade. If you  are short a currency pair, the stop/loss order should be placed above  the current market price. If you are long the currency pair, the  stop/loss order should be placed below the current market price.  Stop/loss orders help traders control risk by capping losses. Stop/loss  orders are counter-intuitive because you do not want them to be hit;  however, you will be happy that you placed them! When logic dictates,  you can control greed.

Where should I place my stop and limit orders?As  a general rule of thumb, traders should set stop/loss orders closer to  the opening price than limit orders. If this rule is followed, a trader  needs to be right less than 50% of the time to be profitable. For  example, a trader that uses a 30 pip stop/loss and 100-pip limit orders,  needs only to be right 1/3 of the time to make a profit. Where the  trader places the stop and limit will depend on how risk-adverse he is.  Stop/loss orders should not be so tight that normal market volatility  triggers the order. Similarly, limit orders should reflect a realistic  expectation of gains based on the market's trading activity and the  length of time one wants to hold the position. In initially setting up  and establishing the trade, the trader should look to change the stop  loss and set it at a rate in the 'middle ground' where they are not  overexposed to the trade, and at the same time, not too close to the  market.

Trading foreign currencies is a demanding  and potentially profitable opportunity for trained and experienced  investors. However, before deciding to participate in the Forex market,  you should soberly reflect on the desired result of your investment and  your level of experience. Warning! Do not invest money you cannot afford  to lose.

So, there is significant risk in any  foreign exchange deal. Any transaction involving currencies involves  risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing  political and/or economic conditions, that may substantially affect the  price or liquidity of a currency.

Moreover, the  leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have  an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work  against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could  sustain a total loss of your initial margin funds and be required to  deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet  any margin call within the time prescribed, your position will be  liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting losses.  'Stop-loss' or 'limit' order strategies may lower an investor's exposure  to risk.

Easy-Forex foreign exchange technology  links around-the-clock to the world's foreign currency exchange trading  floors to get the lowest foreign currency rates and to take every  opportunity to make or settle a transaction.

Avoiding/lowering risk when trading Forex:Trade  like a technical analyst. Understanding the fundamentals behind an  investment also requires understanding the technical analysis method.  When your fundamental and technical signals point to the same direction,  you have a good chance to have a successful trade, especially with good  money management skills. Use simple support and resistance technical  analysis, Fibonacci Retracement and reversal days. Be disciplined.  Create a position and understand your reasons for having that position,  and establish stop loss and profit taking levels. Discipline includes  hitting your stops and not following the temptation to stay with a  losing position that has gone through your stop/loss level. When you  buy, buy high. When you sell, sell higher. Similarly, when you sell,  sell low. When you buy, buy lower. Rule of thumb: In a bull market, be  long or neutral - in a bear market, be short or neutral. If you forget  this rule and trade against the trend, you will usually cause yourself  to suffer psychological worries, and frequently, losses. And never add  to a losing position. On Easy-Forex the trader can change their trade  orders as many times as they wish free of charge, either as a stop loss  or as a take profit. The trader can also close the trade manually  without a stop loss or profit take order being hit. Many successful  traders set their stop loss price beyond the rate at which they made the  trade so that the worst that can happen is that they get stopped out  and make a profit.

Stop-loss orders: This is minimizing risk  when placing an entry order.  A stop-loss order gives instructions to  exit your position if the currency price reaches a certain point. If you  take a short position (expecting the price to fall) you would place a  stop loss order above current market price. If you take a long position  (expecting the price to rise) you would place a stop loss order below  current market price.
Let's take for an  example, you take a short position on USD/CDN, this means that you  expect the US dollar to fall against the Canadian dollar.  Let's take  for an example also that the quote is USD/CDN 1.2138/43 - you can sell  US$1 for 1.2138 CDN dollars or sell 1.2143 CDN dollars for US$1. You can  then place an order like this: Sell USD:    1 standard lot USD/CDN @ 1.2138 = $121,380 CDN    Pip Value:    1 pip = $10    Stop-Loss:    1.2148    Margin:    $1,000 (1%)
You  are selling US$100,000 and buying CDN$121,380.  Your stop loss order  will be executed if the dollar goes above 1.2148, in which case you will  lose $100. However, USD/CDN falls to 1.2118/23.  You can now sell $1 US  for 1.2118 CDN or sell 1.2123 CDN for $1 US.
Because you  entered the transaction by selling US dollars (buying short), you must  now buy back US dollars and sell CDN dollars to realize your profit. You  buy back US$100,000 at the current USD/CDN rate of 1.2123 for a cost of  121,223 CDN.
Since you originally sold them for  CDN$121,380 you made a profit of $157 Canadian dollars or US$129.51 (157  divided by the current exchange rate of 1.2123).

Money Management

This  section is one of the most important sections you will ever read about trading.

Why is it important? Well, we are in the business of making money,  and in order to make money we have to learn how to manage it.  Ironically, this is one of the most overlooked areas in trading. Many  traders are just anxious to get right into trading with no regards to  their total account size. They simply determine how much they can  stomach to lose in a single trade and hit the “trade” button. There’s a  term for this type of investing….it’s called GAMBLING!

When you trade without money management rules, you are in fact  gambling. You are not looking at the long term return on your  investment. Instead you are only looking for that “jackpot”. Money  management rules will not only protect us, but they will make us very  profitable in the long run. If you don’t believe me, and you think that  “gambling” is the way to get rich, then consider this example:

People go  to Las Vegas  all the time to gamble their money in hopes to win a big jackpot, and in fact, many  people do  win. So how in the world, are casino’s still making money if many  individuals are winning jackpots? The answer is that while even though  people win jackpots, in the long run, casino’s are still profitable  because they rake in more money from the people that don’t win. That is where the term “the house always  wins” comes from.

The truth is that casinos are just very rich statisticians. They know  that in the long run, they will be the ones making the money—not the  gamblers. Even if Joe Schmoe wins $100,000 jackpot in a slot machine,  the casinos know that there will be 100 more gamblers who WON’T win that  jackpot and the money will go right back in their pockets.

This is a classic example of how statisticians make money over  gamblers. Even though both lose money, the statistician, or casino in  this case, knows how to control their losses. Essentially, this is how  money management works.If you learn how to control your losses, you will  have a chance at being profitable.

You want to be the rich statistician…NOT the gambler because in the long  run, you want to “always be the winner.”

So how do you become this rich statistician instead of a loser?

Drawdown and Maximum Drawdown?

So we know that money management  will make us money in the long  run, but now we’d like to show you the  other side of things. What would happen  if you didn’t use money  management rules?

Consider this example:

Let’s say you have a $100,000 and you lose $50,000. What percentage  of your account have you  lost? The answer is 50%. Simple enough. Now,  what percentage of that $50,000 do  you have to make in order to get  back to your original $100,000? It’s not 50%--you’d have to make back  100% of  your $50,000 to get back to your original $100,000. This is  called drawdown.  For this example, we would’ve had a 50% drawdown.

The point of that little illustration is that it is very easy to   lose money and a lot harder to make it back.  We know you’re saying to  yourself, “I’m not going to lose 50% of my  account in one trade.” Well  we would  certainly hope not!

However, what if you lost 3, 4, or even 10 trades in a row? That  couldn’t possibly happen to you, right?  (Sarcasm used) You have a trading system  that wins 70% of the time, so there is NO way you could lose 10 trades in a  row. (Even more sarcasm used)

Well, while you may have a good system, consider this example:

In trading, we are always looking for an edge. That is the whole  reason why traders develop  systems. A trading system that is 70%  profitable sounds like a very good edge  to have. But just because your  trading  system is 70% profitable, does that mean for every 100 trades  you make, you  will win 7 out of every 10?

Losing Streak

Not necessarily! How do you know which 70 out of those 100 trades  will be winners?

The answer is that you don’t. You could lose the first 30 trades  in a  row and win the remaining 70. That  would still give you a 70%  profitable system, but you have to ask yourself,  “Would you still be in  the game if you lost 30 trades in a row?”

This is why money management is so important. No matter what system  you use, you will  eventually have a losing streak. Even professional  poker players who make their  living through poker go through horrible  losing streaks, and yet they still end  up profitable.

The reason is that the good poker players practice money management  because they know that they will not win every tournament they play.  Instead, they only risk a small percentage of their total bankroll so  that they can survive those losing streaks.

This is what you must do as a trader. Only risk a small percentage of  your “trading bankroll” so that you can survive your losing streaks.  Remember that if you practice strict money management rules, you will  become the casino and in the long run, “you will always win.”

Let me illustrate what happens when you use proper money management and when you don't...

Don't Lose Your Shirt

Here is a little illustration that will show you the difference  between risking a small percentage of your capital compared to risking a  higher percentage.

http://www.babypips.com/images/money...management.gif

You can see that there is a big difference between risking 2% of your  account compared to risking 10% of your account on a single trade. If  you happened to go through a losing streak and lost only 19 trades in a  row, you would’ve went from starting with $20,000 to having only $3,002  left if you risked 10% on each trade. You would’ve lost over 85% of your  account! If you risked only 2% you would’ve still had $13,903 which is  only a 30% loss of your total account.

Of course, the last thing we want to do is lose 19 trades in a row,  but even if you only lost 5 trades in a row, look at the difference  between risking 2% and 10%. If you risked 2% you would still have  $18,447. If you risked 10% you would only have $13,122. That’s less than  what you would’ve had even if you lost all 19 trades and risked only 2%  of your account!

The point of this illustration is that you want to setup your money management rules so that when you do have a drawdown period  (losing streak) you will still have enough capital to stay in the game.  Can you imagine if you lost 85% of your account? You would have to make  566% on what you are left with in order to get back to break even.  Trust me, you do NOT want to be in that position. In fact, here is a  chart that will illustrate what percentage you would have to make to  breakeven if you were to lose a certain percentage of your account.

http://www.babypips.com/images/money...ement/loss.gif

You can see that the more you lose, the harder it is to make it back  to your original account size. This is all the more reason that you  should do everything you can to protect your account.

So by now, I hope you have gotten it drilled in your head that you  should only risk a small percentage of your account in each trade so  that you can survive your losing streaks and also to avoid a large  drawdown in your account. Remember, you want to be the casino…NOT the  gambler!

Risk to Reward

Another way you can increase your chances of profitability is to  trade when you have the potential to make 3 times more than you are  risking. If you give yourself a 3:1 reward/risk ratio, you have a  significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run.  Take a look at this chart as an example:

http://www.babypips.com/images/money...-to-reward.gif

In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your  trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000. Just remember that  whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of  being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win  percentage.

Summary of Money Management

Be the  casino, not the gambler!  Remember,  casinos are just very rich statisticians!
Drawdown  is a reality and WILL happen to you at some point.  The less you risk in a trade, the less your  maximum drawdown will be.

The more you  lose in your account, the harder it is to make it back to breakeven.

Trade  only a small percentage of your account.   The smaller the better.  3% or  less is recommended.

It is  desirable to trade when you have a high risk to reward ratio.  The higher the ratio, the less you have to be  right.

When I can read articles like this below, it's really time to enter short and trade the opposite.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/10854733/1/gold-prices-break-to-new-highs.html
"The World Gold Council said in its second-quarter Gold Demand Trends  report that the supply of gold grew 17% from a year earlier while gold  demand grew 36%. Turk is looking for $1,800 to $2,000 gold this year.  Based on these prices, he doesn't believe it's too late to dollar-cost  average and buy gold every quarter."

When Gold price has reached its top and highest resistance levels, often you can read comments like this above in constant return.

I can only say at the addressees, who display an incredible arrogance:
"Don't be rediculous"
"What do you think you are?"

"Whom do you take me for?"
"Downright Nonsense!"

and so on...

Thank you for posting it!

You see that Bollinger Lines at the weekly chart goes parallel now. May be then the EMA lines too. If so, then it could be a trading option to trade the weekly range but at M15/M30/H1 and wait at H4 for an breakout of the weekly chart.

The monthly chart shows a hammer (august) but the upper shadow seems a little too long, so may be it's better to wait here what kind of candle is forming in September and trade in the meantime the Weekly, the Daily, (incl. H4, H1, M30, M15).

The market has coming down at the weekly chart. Possiblities for a consolidation seems to be higher now. That means a range trading could be a favorite option, till the next breakout and the triangle could demonstrate this very clear.

Great charts!

Congrats!

Floating Loss - Open Trades - "Non Stop Loss Concept":

In any system, you’ll encounter both winning and losing trades.          So you’ll want to be able to easily handle any          losing trades, and continue to trade the winning trades          at the same time, so that you have a profitable system. That’s what forex money management is all about.

You'll see that in the next weeks all open trades will running in the  win, may be tomorrow, may be next week, may be next month, we don't  know! It's only the drawback of my art of Non-Stop-Loss Trading, which  you make allowance for the money management.

Risk and money management, or the art of position          sizing, is an important part of your forex trading as you’ll          soon find out..

Why?

Because it determines whether you’ll be able to keep trading as          long as you like, to continue making your profits.

In any system, you’ll encounter both winning and losing trades.          So you’ll want to be able to easily handle any          losing trades, and continue to trade the winning trades          at the same time, so that you have a profitable system.

That’s what forex money management is all about.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
http://www.theforextrader.net/forex-money-management.php

As an extreme example, if you put say a large chunk of your float into          each trade without a position sizing model, and you make a profit, great,          your profit will be much bigger than if you did have position sizing rules.          So far so good. But if your next trade is a loss, you may lose your float,          and that’s the end of the trading!

Let’s take a more realistic example.

Let’s say that your forex trading system has an 80% win-loss ratio,          and that the size of your winning trades are on average 3 times that of          your losing trades. This is your trading edge. This is          why you can profit from your trading, whereas someone else who has no          system, or is using an ineffective system, is unlikely to profit except          out of pure luck.

But even with this trading edge, you may hit a string of losses.

So even with a good system, you still need to have an appropriate money          management model to survive and prosper...

--- 帖子 #579 ---
http://www.theforextrader.net/forex-money-management.php

Let’s look into it a bit further.

Let’s say that you’re trading a cash float of $5000, leveraged          up to $500 000, that is with 100:1 leverage. And let’s say that          the maximum drawdown of your system historically is $2000, when following          a particular money management method. So in this case, the drawdown is          40% of the cash float. Maximum historical drawdown refers to the biggest          decrease in the cash float that has occurred in the past when backtesting          or trading your system.

Now if you’re trading a good profitable system, then with the risk          management rules that the system is designed to use, you can go on to          make the profit that year that the system will generate. Say the system          made 500% on your cash float that year. This means that by trading with          that system, and its money management rules, you were then able to overcome          this 40% loss, to end up 500% in profit.

That is, you rode through the drawdown period, continued trading and          made this tidy profit.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
http://www.theforextrader.net/forex-money-management.php

And another reason to have appropriate money management is that in the          beginning, you may make mistakes in your trading. So your losses in the          beginning days may be higher than necessary.

That's why money management is important for any trading, including forex          trading.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
http://www.theforextrader.net/forex-money-management.php

So let’s summarise these two crucial points so far:
1. Money management is important, as it lets you          live to tell the tale, and profit well!
2. The performance of a system, in terms of profits,          drawdown, or any other parameter you want to measure, depends on both          the system itself and the money management rules it uses. A system should          suggest a range of acceptible money management method or rules which gives          best results, that is, good profits and an acceptable drawdown.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
http://www.theforextrader.net/forex-money-management.php

Let’s have a look at a method of money management that’s          often used, called the percentage risk method.

Note that this is not the only method of risk management, and some systems          do use a different risk method. But it is frequently used, and is good          one for you to understand, so that you can then compare risk methods to          each other.

Money Management Part 1: Percentage Risk Method

The percentage risk method as a money management method, aims          to “risk” the same percentage of your cash float (not the          same trade size) per trade. Note that you won’t have the          same trade size for each trade necessarily.

This method relies on knowing:

1. The stop loss size of the trade, and

2. The percentage risk (of your unleveraged cash float),          that you want to risk per trade.

So this percentage risk method says that there’ll be a certain          percentage of your cash float that is at risk per trade. And to know how          much is actually “at risk” in a specific trade, you need to          know the above two parameters: the stop loss size for that trade, and          the percentage risk that you’ve chosen.

As an example, let’s say that you’ve chosen a percentage          risk of 2% of your cash float. If your cash float is $5000, this means          that you’d want to risk 2% of $5000 per trade, which is $100. So          with every trade, the maximum you’d lose (assuming no gapping or          slippage) would be $100.

With this chosen percentage, it would take you 50 losses in a row before          you’d lose all of your float (50 x 2% = 100%). Assuming that your          system is a good one, then 50 losses in a row would be very unlikely.

If your system for example has an 80% win loss ratio, and that the maximum          number of losses in a row historically was 7, then getting 50 losses in          a row is very unlikely. The chances of this happening in fact is 0.2 to          the power of 50, a very small number.

On the other hand, if the risk chosen was 4%, then it would take 25 rather          than 50 losing trades in a row to lose the entire float. So as you can          see, the number of losing trades required to lose the float decreases          as you increase the percentage risk.

So now that we know how much is at risk per trade, how do we calculate          our actual position size for a particular trade?

For currency pairs where the USD is the terms          currency

Let's firstly take the situation where we're trading a currency pair          where the USD is the terms currency, such as EURUSD,          GBPUSD, AUDUSD. To work out our trade size (face value), you would need          to know the stop loss size of the trade. So:

Assuming:
Cash float is $ 5000 USD
% risk is 2%
Risk per trade is $100 USD (500 x 0.02), and

We’re trading a currency pair where the USD is the terms currency

Face value (of base currency) =  risk per trade in $USD / stop loss size in $USD

So for example, if we’re trading the EURUSD, and the stop loss          size for that trade was 30 pips, then our stop loss size would be equivalent          to 30 pips in USD, because if you make a profit or loss, it is in the          terms currency.

Therefore:

Face value (of base currency) = $100 / $0.0030

Face value (of base currency) = 33 333

That is, 33 333 of the base currency, which in this example, is the EUR.

For currency pairs where the USD is not          the terms currency

What happens if your float is in say $USD, but the USD is not          the terms currency? This occurs when you’re trading the USDCAD,          USDCHF, USDJPY for example.

In this case, you’d need to do an extra step,          which is to adjust the stop loss size in the terms currency, to its value          in $USD. That is:

Stop loss size in $USD pips =  Stop loss size in the terms currency (eg CAD,                CHF, JPY) in pips / Price of the currency

For example, if you’re trading USDCHF , and the stop loss size          was 55 pips, and the currency rate for this pair was 1.2878, then:

Stop loss size in $USD pips= 55 / 1.2878

Stop loss size in $USD pips = 43 USD pips.

You’d then use this number in the formula above to calculate your          trade size or face value:

Face value (of base currency) = risk per trade in $USD / stop loss size          in $USD

Face value (of base currency) = 100 / 0.0043

Face value (of base currency) = 23 255 USD.

Now, when looking at money management, also take into consideration your          maximum number of open positions.

Position Sizing Part 2: Maximum Number Of Open Positions

A final point to consider would be the maximum number of open  positions,          that is the maximum number of trades that you want  to be in at one time.

This is the other factor to decide when managing risk.

If for example, you chose a 2% risk, you may also say chose to be  in          a maximum of 4 positions at any one time. If all 4 of those  positions          close out at a loss on the same day, then you would  have had an 8% decrease          in your cash float that day.

This is a decision that you will have to make for yourself,  though many          systems will have a guide about this for you. In  the beginning, your maximum          number of open trades may depend on  how well you know the system. You          may find yourself starting  with fewer trades on at the same time in the          beginning, and  considering a larger number as you get used to trading          the  system.

Forex Money Management: Putting It All Together

So putting it all together, all the way from how much float you have          to how much profit is made from a trade...

As an example, let’s say that you had a cash float          of $10 000 and so your leveraged float is $1 000 000, and you used the          fixed % risk model.

For a trade where the stop loss size was 30 (terms          currency) pips, and assuming a fixed % risk of say 3%          (which is $300) of your cash float , your trade size          in this trade would be 300/0.0030 = $100 000 worth of base currency.

If your profit was then 75 pips, then          this would be $750 worth of the terms currency          (as the face value traded was $100 000).

So there you have it.

An extra tip here for calculating the stop loss size:

Remember that when you’re looking at a chart, that you’re           looking at the bid prices (most charts display bid, not offer,  prices).          Then as you set your stop loss, on many platforms, you  have the choice          of “stop if bid” or “stop if offered”. So say           you were in a short trade, having entered at 1.2880, and your  stop loss          is at 1.2840. And according to your system rules, all  stops are set as          “stop is bid”.

When you’re stopped out, you’d be buying when the bid          price reaches 1.2740 because you’ve used “stop if bid”.          But because you buy at the offer, your actual           buy price would be at say 1.2843, due to the spread. Your stop  loss is          therefore actually 37 pips, not 40 pips. A small  point, but one which          often causes confusion.

The USD Index measures the performance of the US Dollar against a basket of currencies: EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, CHF and SEK. It includes 9 chart types, 1 up to 1,000 periods and a vast range of customizable technical indicators.

http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index

USD Index

Der U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) stellt das Verhältnis von sechs Währungen im Vergleich zum US-Dollar dar, wobei der Euro mit dem Handelsvolumen aus zwölf EU-Ländern berücksichtigt wird. Diese machen einen Anteil von 57,6 Prozent im Index aus. Die weiteren Währungen sind der japanische Yen (13,6 Prozent), das britische Pfund (11,9 Prozent), der kanadische Dollar (9,1 Prozent), die schwedische Krone (4,2 Prozent) sowie der Schweizer Franken (3,6 Prozent).

Anhand des Verlaufs des U.S. Dollar Index lässt sich die Stärke oder  Schwäche des US-Dollars ablesen. Ein steigender Index bedeutet eine  Aufwertung des US-Dollars gegenüber den Währungen im Währungskorb, ein fallender Index dagegen eine Abwertung.

Zusammenhänge zum CRB-Index,  der die Preisentwicklung von 19 Rohstoffen misst, sind erkennbar. Ein  fallender U.S. Dollar Index bedeutet tendenziell steigende  Rohstoffpreise. Dies gilt insbesondere für die Agrarrohstoffe und den Ölpreis. Selbst der Goldpreis  korreliert mit einem fallenden Index. So markierte der U.S. Dollar  Index am 17. März 2008 ein Allzeittief und der Goldpreis in US-Dollar am  gleichen Tag ein Allzeithoch.

Die Formel für die Berechnung des U.S. Dollar Index ist 50,14348112  multipliziert mit dem Produkt aller Bestandteile im Währungskorb, die zu  einer Hochzahl angehoben werden, die ihrer prozentualen Gewichtung  gleich ist ((EURUSD ^ - 0,576) * (JPY ^ - 0,136) * (GBP ^ - 0,119) *  (CAN ^ - 0,091) * (SEK ^ - 0,042) * (CHF^ - 0,036)). Alle Währungen  werden in den Maßeinheiten der Währung pro US-Dollar ausgedrückt.[1]

Vergleichbar mit dem U.S. Dollar Index ist der „Broad Index“ der US-Notenbank  (FED). Der Index der FED misst im Vergleich zum U.S. Dollar Index viel  akkurater den Wert des US-Dollars, da die Gewichtung der FED die  Wettbewerbsfähigkeit US-amerikanischer Güter im Vergleich zu anderen  Ländern und Handelspartnern stellt.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index

The US Dollar Index (USDX) is an index (or measure) of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies.

It is a weighted geometric mean of the dollar's value compared only with Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight Japanese yen (JPY), 13.6% weight Pound sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight Canadian dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight Swedish krona (SEK), 4.2% weight and Swiss franc (CHF) 3.6% weight.  USDX started in March 1973, soon after the dismantling of the Bretton Woods system.  At its start, the value of the US Dollar Index was 100.000. It has  since traded as high as the mid-160s and as low as 70.698 on March 16,  2008, the lowest since its inception in 1973.

The makeup of the "basket" has been altered only once, when several  European currencies were subsumed by the Euro at the start of 1999.

USDX is updated whenever US Dollar markets are open, which is from  Sunday evening New York time (early Monday morning Asia time) for 24  hours a day to late Friday afternoon New York time.

USDX can be traded as a futures contract on the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE). It is also available in exchange traded funds (ETFs), options and mutual funds.

What is the U.S. Dollar Index?

If you’ve traded stocks,  you’re familiar with all the indices available such as the Dow Jones  Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ Composite Index, Russell 2000, S&P  500, Wilshire 5000,  and the Nimbus 2001. Oh wait, the last one is  actually Harry Potter’s broomstick.

Well if U.S. stocks have an index, the U.S. dollar can’t be outdone.  For currency traders like us, we have the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX).

The U.S. Dollar Index consists of a geometric weighted average of a basket of foreign currencies against the dollar.

Come again?! Okay before you fall asleep on us after that super geeky definition, let’s break it down.

It’s very similar to how the stock indices work in that it provides a  general indication of the value of a basket of securities. Of course,  the “securities” we’re talking about here are other major world  currencies.

The Basket

The U.S. Dollar Index consists of six foreign currencies. They are the: Euro (EUR) Yen (JPY) Cable (GBP) Loonie (CAD) Kronas (SEK) Francs (CHF)   Here’s a trick question. If  the index is made up of 6 currencies, how many countries are included?

If you answered “6”, you’re  wrong. If you answered “21”, you’re a genius.

There are 21 countries total,  because there are 16 members of the  European Union that have adopted the euro as their sole currency, plus  the other five countries (Japan, Great   Britain, Canada,  Sweden, and  Switzerland) and their accompanying currencies.

It’s obvious that 21  countries make up a small portion of the world  but many other currencies follow  the U.S. Dollar index very closely.  This makes the USDX a pretty good tool for  measuring the U.S. dollar’s  global strength.

The USDX Components

Now that we know what the  basket of currencies are, let’s get back to that “geometric weighted average”  part.   Because not every country is  the same size, it’s only fair that each is given appropriate weights when  calculating the U.S. Dollar Index. Check out the current weights:

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...ex-weights.gif

As you can see, with its 12 countries, euros make up a big  chunk of  the U.S. Dollar Index. The other five make up less than 43 percent.

Here's something interesting: When the euro falls, which way does the U.S Dollar Index move?

The euro makes up such a huge portion of the U.S. Dollar Index, they  might as well call this index the "Anti-Euro Index". Because the USDX is  so heavily influenced by the euro, people have looked for a more  "balanced" dollar index. More on that later though. First, let's go to  the charts!

How to Read the U.S. Dollar Index

Here’s a chart of the U.S. Dollar at the Dollar Index:

http://www.babypips.com/school/images/usdx.gif

First, notice that the index is calculated 24 hours a day,  seven days a week. The USDX measures the dollar’s general value relative to a  base of 100.000. Huh?!

Okay. For example, the current reading says 86.212. This  means that  the dollar has fallen 13.788% since the start of the index. (86.212  -  100.000).

If the reading was 120.650, it means the dollar’s value has  risen 20.650% since the start of the index. (120.650 – 100.00)

The start of the index is March 1973. This is when the  world’s  biggest nations met in Washington   D.C. and all agreed to allow  their  currencies to float freely against each. The start of the index is also   known as the “base period”.
The U.S. Dollar Index Formula

This is strictly for the grown and geeky. Here is the formula to  calculating USDX:
USDX  = 50.14348112 × EURUSD^(-0.576) × USDJPY^(0.136) ×  GBPUSD^(-0.119)  × USDCAD^(0.091) × USDSEK^(0.042) × USDCHF^(0.036)

A carry trade involves borrowing or selling a financial  instrument with  a low interest rate, then using it to purchase a financial  instrument  with a higher interest rate.  While you are paying the low  interest  rate on the financial instrument you borrowed/sold, you are collecting   higher interest on the financial instrument you purchased.  Thus your  profit is the money you collect  from the interest rate differential.

Currency Carry Trade

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg
What Does Currency Carry Trade Mean?

A strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a relatively low interest rate  and uses the funds to purchase a different currency yielding a higher  interest rate. A trader using this strategy attempts to capture the  difference between the rates, which can often be substantial, depending  on the amount of leverage used.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg

Investopedia explains Currency Carry Trade

Here's an example of a "yen carry trade": a trader borrows 1,000 Japanese yen from a Japanese bank,  converts the funds into U.S. dollars and buys a bond for the equivalent  amount. Let's assume that the bond pays 4.5% and the Japanese interest  rate is set at 0%. The trader stands to make a profit of 4.5% as long as  the exchange rate between the countries does not change. Many  professional traders use this trade because the gains can become very  large when leverage is taken into consideration. If the trader in our  example uses a common leverage factor of 10:1, then she can stand to  make a profit of 45%.

The big risk in a carry trade is the  uncertainty of exchange rates. Using the example above, if the U.S.  dollar were to fall in value relative to the Japanese yen, then the  trader would run the risk of losing money. Also, these transactions are  generally done with a lot of leverage, so a small movement in exchange  rates can result in huge losses unless the position is hedged  appropriately.

Fibonacci method in Forex

Straight to the point:

Fibonacci Retracement Levels are:

0.382, 0.500, 0.618 — three the most important levels

Fibonacci retracement levels are used as support and resistance levels

Fibonacci Extension Levels are:

0.618, 1.000, 1.618 — three the most important levels

Fibonacci extension levels are used as profit taking levels.

So, what we will learn today is how to apply Fibonacci tool and how to interpret results that we see on the screen.

To set up Fibonacci on the chart we need to find out:

1. Is it uptrend or downtrend?

2. Highest and lowest swings in the chart formation (A, B points).

And go with the trend!

So, click on Fibonacci tool from trading platform that you use. Now, as shown on the Figure 1:
http://www.forexfibonacci.com/fibonacci1.gif

We have an uptrend. A — our lowest swing, B — our highest swing. So, we  will look to BUY some lots at the good lowest price and go up with the  trend.

Click on A and drag your cursor to B, click. There you go! You must see  different lines appeared on your chart. Those lines are called Fibonacci  Retracement and Extension Levels.

So, what we are expecting is next: the price should retrace (go down)  from point B to some point C, and then continue up in the direction of  the trend.

Those three dotted lines (0.618, 0.500, 0.382) at the bottom on our  picture shows three Fibonacci retracement levels where we expect the  price to take a U-turn and go up again. There we will place our BUY  order.

The best situation would be to buy at the lowest level — 0.618 — point  C. And on practice the price usually gives us this chance. However,  0.500 is also a good level to place a BUY order.

http://www.forexfibonacci.com/

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Well, let's take a look at the progress.

http://www.forexfibonacci.com/fibonacci2.gif

The price has successfully reached the lowest 0.618 point and made a U-turn.

So, now when we have our BUY order placed at desired point C, we would  like to set some targets to take our profit in the future. For profit  taking levels we use Fibonacci extension levels (0.618, 1.000, 1.618). The most common is 0.618 extension level, but when the price  shows good potential to reach next 1.000 or even 1.618 level, you can  leave your trade to get that target too.

We will choose 0.618 extension level as our profit target, and according to Figure 2, D is our point for taking profit.

Important note: in this Fibonacci tutorial 0.618 extension level  (as well as 1.000, 1.618 levels) are calculated in relation to the point  B, which means that B point represents a 0% extension.

Some Forex traders like to start counting from point A, then the  distance from A to B would be already 100% of the price move. Thus  moving further from B would be 1xx.x %.

For example: looking at the last picture, if to start counting from  point A, then point D would be a 1.618 Fibonacci extension level or a  161.8% of the price move.

Now let's have a look at a real forex chart.

Same steps will also apply to downtrend price movement.

A little bit of theory:

Leonardo Fibonacci is a founder of a simple series of numbers related to the natural proportions of things in the universe. Fibonacci numbers create ratios that arise from  the following number series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,  144: Calculated this way: 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3 and so forth.

The ratio of any number in relevance to the next higher number is 0.618. E.g. 55/89=0.618.

There is no need to perform calculation each time you get into a trade, your trading platform is going to do it for you.

These are the ratios you have to know:

Fibonacci Retracement Levels

0.236, 0.382, 0.500,  0.618, 0.764

Fibonacci Extension Levels

0.382, 0.618, 1.000,  1.382, 1.618

Fibonacci Extension Levels

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Traders use the Fibonacci retracement levels as support and resistance levels.  Since so many traders watch these same levels and place buy and sell  orders on them to enter trades or place stops, the support and  resistance levels become a self-fulfilling expectation.

Getting  straight to the meat, Fibonacci Retracements are probability points  where a currency, or stock will "bounce back" to, after a large move,  and then continue in the original direction.  Think of Retracements in  terms of Newton's Laws of Motion: "For every action there is an equal  and opposite reaction."

Within this understanding, trading  carries some of the same principals.  However, I would like to add that  after a large move, the opposite reaction loses energy quickly, and  thus, is often why the 'reactive move' after a large move, is often less  than the large move itself.

Ironically, Leonardo Fibonacci lived  in the 13th century, while Newton worked in the 17th century.  Perhaps  Fibonacci unknowingly uncovered truth behind Newton's laws, centuries  before Newton even came up with them.

Fibonacci in Nature

If  you're not familiar with Fibonacci ratios and numbers the concepts are  directly derived from nature and are found in virtually all organic  sciences today.  Basically, Fibonacci numbers are resultant from adding  the previous together to find the next.  For example 1+1=2, 2+1=3,  3+2=5, 5+3=8 and so on. The Fibonacci string would look like:  0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233...

In nature, the spiral of  seeds in a sunflower are exactly ordered in Fibonacci sequence, as with  many occurrences in organic life.

Fibonacci ratios are also  derived from the numerical sequence For example, if you take any eighth  number in the sequence and divide it by the number following it in the  sequence (dividing the eight by the ninth), the answer will ALWAYS be  61.8.  In the above string, if we divide the eighth number (21) by the  ninth (34), we get 61.76, or 61.8 rounded up.

It just is, that's why.

Market  quants hold that Fibonacci is not only true in organic matter, but  within the market itself, and Fibonacci ratios, more often than not, lay  out of a map for retracement levels, after a significant move.  Thus,  perhaps Newton's Law of Motion that says, "For every action there is an  equal and opposite reaction" failed to take into account the loss of  energy in reaction, something that may be solved with Fibonacci ratios.   I believe there would be another factor involved though, which may be  overcome combining the founder of quantum physics Max Karl Ernst Ludwig  Planck's formula, where "energy is and absorbed in quantities divisible  by discrete 'energy elements'"*  and simple Fibonacci.

Perhaps  someday I will make an attempt to prove my instincts in math. Before I  get sidetracked (which is way too easy) any further though, let's look  into how you can - very simply - use Fibonacci Retracements in Forex  trading...

Fibonacci in Forex - The Self Fulfilling Prophecy

All  of the magical math in the world will never make Fibonacci retracements  true 100% of the time.  Period.  Thus, a little common sense goes a  long way when using any type of mathematical, or technical indicator to  trade from.  If the market is showing something different than the  indicator, enough people believe in something different that the  indicator is wrong.  Fibonacci retracements are only good so long as  enough people are watching and acting on the same information that the  collective whole makes the occurrence a self-fulfilling prophecy.  What  I'm saying is that even if you've opened a trade based on Fibonacci  retracement expectations, be prepared to close the position, should  common sense warrant such.

With the aforementioned in mind,  Fibonacci Retracements work on both short and long-term time frames for  all types of traders.  For this article, we will only look at short-term  trading with 4-hour charts.

First, before we even consider a  Fibonacci retracements, you need to be able to spot when a move has  occurred that would warrant using Fibonacci Retracements.  This can be  as simple as looking at a chart, and visually seeing that a large move  has transpired - and capitulated.  What I mean by this is, if when  looking at a chart you're expecting to see empirical proof that a move  has stalled, you will never be able to do so.  You will see some signs,  like MACD or Stochastics bottoming out, or a candlestick pattern like a  hammer bottom, but you will never know for sure.  One way to have a  slight bit of assurance though, is to look for candlestick confirmation,  something I recently covered in my article Why Confirmation Counts.

Regardless,  only countless hours of pouring over charts will give you 'the feel'.   Once you are able to infer a move is over, you can begin to apply  Fibonacci retracements for profit targets points if you are trying to  trade the rebound, or for new entries, if you are waiting to get back  into the currency, for a continued move in the same direction, as the  previous 'large move.'

The below chart shows a significant move  that recently occurred when the U.S. dollar sold off against the Swiss  franc.   Based on this chart, many traders were likely looking for a  retracement.  Some turned the dollar long, others waited for key  retracement levels to be hit before taking positions...

http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...-025108-01.gif

Now, let me show you how you can trade a 'reversal' using Fibonacci, after a large move.

In  the below chart, you will see a large downward move, where the  Australian dollar declined significantly against the New Zealand dollar.   Several indicator (not shown) displayed that a reversal was looming,  thus perceptive traders would have taken a long position in the  Australian dollar, using the low of the range as a stop.  The AUD  quickly rebounded, touching the 38.2 retracement within 12 hours of the  low.  However, it sold off again (twice actually) before making another  run at the 50% retracement.  Jittery traders would have been shaken out  for sure; however, those with steadfast stops just below the low of the  original moves would have not.  (You must decide for you whether you  will trade for larger moves, or quickly scalp profits any time the  market makes a sudden moves.  It is my experience that traders who take  small profit after small profit and cannot hold for larger wins,  eventually get killed when they take a bigger loss. Truly great traders  know one of the keys to success is: little loss, little loss, big win,  not vice versa.)

http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...-025108-02.gif

Regardless,  those who were able to hold, would have seen the AUD/NZD briefly pop  above the 50% retracement a few days after the initial move occurred.   Here's one way to solve the problem previously shown by failure at the  38.2% retracement.  When trading a reversal, set your stop as soon as  you make the trade. Then, set a sell order for one quarter of your  position at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, so if the trade fails, you  will have a small buffer when your stop is hit on the downside. (You  will need to adjust the position size in your stop, if the 38.2%  retracement is hit, accounting for the 25% of your position you just  sold for a profit.)  At the same time you made the initial trade, set a  sell order for 50% of the total initial position at the 50% retracement.  In the case of AUD/NZD, when the pair first hit the 50% retracement,  you would have taken even more off the table and would need to adjust  your stop order accordingly, as you will now only have 25% of the  original position.  Then, with the remaining 25%, you can set another  order to sell at the 61.8% retracement, or let it ride.  FYI, from my  experience trading Forex, the 50% retracement mark seems to hold the  most weight. If a pair does not reverse the bounce after the large move,  and you see a 4-hour bar close above the 50% retracement, there's a  good chance the pair will retrace the whole move.  I'm not sure why, but  from what I've seen the 61.8% retracement seems to hold less weight  than the 50% retracement, at least when using 4-hour charts.

Regardless, the retracements serve as profit targets for reversal trades.

For  traders who think the pair will continue the original move, you can  place your orders at the Fibonacci retracement points, where you hope to  reenter in the direction of the big-move trend.  One way to do so is  place an order for 25% of your total predetermined size at the 38.2%  mark, 50% at the 50% mark and 25% at the 61.8% mark. This way, you've  allowed yourself 'wiggle room' if the 38.2% and 50% retracements do not  hold.  It's important to note though, that if the 61.8% retracement is  breached, the pair will likely retrace the entire move, something that  happens often in Forex trading.  The best rule of thumb in this case is  as simple as the old market saying: When in doubt, get out.

In this post you are talking about your balance on July 26th. Yet your current myfxbook system starts on august 27th. What happened to the previous system?

I also noticed that your current open losses are about 40% bigger, than all the gains for the life of the account. Do you really think that having a 100% hit rate is important enough to hold bad trades until they margin call your account. Your avg win is 40 pips yet most of your open trades are about 500 pips in the red. Since you hold all your losers until they turn into winners, why do you need all of those 20 or so indicators and lines on your charts. Looks like you could do it with just flipping a coin, place your trade, then wait until it becomes a winner. Its not like all of those indicators are increasing your accuracy.

Not trying to be an a$$ or anything, just genuinely curious.

The performance of a system, in terms of profits,           drawdown, or any other parameter you want to measure, depends on both           the system itself and the money management rules it uses. A  system should          suggest a range of acceptible money management  method or rules which gives          best results, that is, good profits  and an acceptable drawdown.

Non Stop Loss Concept

13 "non-stop-loss-trades" have running into the win at 2010 September 15. A part of them could have been a deficit by trading the stopp loss concept. I know why many brokers favour the stopp loss concept. Why? You have only reduce your lot size a wee bit. All yellow marked trades are 9 days to 16 days old.

Oh yes! RSI, CCI and MACD signalize a neg. divergence. I would go enter short with 1 position and would wait for a CCI(14) 200 Line Top and enter short then again with 3 positions. Could also be that the market consolidate before his next upside movement. MACD couuld go a little further up, also CCI. Might be better to wait for an excellent H4/daily price formation like a shooting star at the top or so.

Remember the date 2008.12.28 with its High at 1.7991. H1 seems to go upwards in the direction of CCI(14) 100 line, may be more.

The two black candlesticks of the pattern are the crows                            reminding ominous looking black crows atop a tree branch.

Confirmation for the Bearish Upside Gap Two Crows Pattern                            may be mildly suggested. If in the fourth session prices                            fail to regain high ground, lower prices should be expected.

Hi FC.....

AUDUSD on D1 TF .. Candle Pattern state possible The Bearish Three Inside Down Pattern and check to WK TF possible shooting star.....

D1 TF CCI 14 is on the negative div......

tomorrow I hope we will see Bearish engulfing pattern to confirm the reversal of AUD .. key point area 0.923xx for middle term reversal and 0.91xx

and long term down trend is below 0.87xxx

The Bearish Three Inside Down Pattern is another name                            for the Confirmed Bearish Harami Pattern. The third                            day confirms the bearish trend reversal.
Recognition Criteria:

1. Market is characterized by uptrend.

2. We see a Bearish Harami Pattern in the first two days.

3. We then see a black candlestick on the third day with                          a lower close than the second day.
Explanation:

The first two days of this three-day pattern is a Bearish                            Harami Pattern, and the third day confirms the reversal                            suggested by Bearish Harami Pattern since it is a black                            candlestick closing with a new low for the three days.
Important Factors:

The reliability of this pattern is very high, but still                          a confirmation in the form of a black candlestick with                          a lower close or a gap-down is suggested.

Weekly and monthly chart shows an upward trend and monthly is now struggling at his resistance level around 0.9385 like 2009.11.01 and 2010.04.01. If the price vola are related powerful like 2010.07.01 and 2010.05.01 we could see prices over 0.962. In addition the Bearish Harami Pattern isn't a real classical one.

Bearish Harami

If the first candle of Harami is a long bullish candle then the   pattern has bearish implications. Especially if the pattern appears on   top of an uptrend then it could be a sign of reversal (see image).
http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ish_Harami.png If the second candle is a doji or a bearish spinning   top then the reversal sign could be more reliable but there are times   that even a bullish spinning top could be a good sign of reversal. Since   this pattern is not a reliable one at all times, the best practice is   to use other tools to confirm it.

May be in conjunction with BB we have a powerful argument more, so Bollinger Band might to be a good tool for this purpose. In this special market environment now, someone could tend to prefere to use the Enhanced Bands Indicator which could be even better as combines both BB and volatility to predict the tops (and the bottom) of the market.

Moreover: My daily chart shows only one inside pattern and not three of them. It could also be only some spinning tops which make an appearance at the weekly and monthly resistance level.

So I stay at the sideline due to the fact that the weekly and monthly chart are in a powerful upward trend and due to the fact that friday is a day where a trader shoudn't regularily trade. So we'll see next week, may be end of month more. My mind is: Be careful! I would trade M30/H1/H4 but not the turnaround at the daily chart now!, although good powerful arguments are here for a trading daily down.

Hi FC,

Thanks for yours advise .....

I like your interpetation very much and I think this is that big capital will mislead most of the 95% traders now. It could be that the market price will go down. We don't know. But I think now many traders take a short and tomorrow friday big capital could turn market price up in the heaven.  Earliest opportunity! Why not? This could going to happen willy-nilly. If so then we could see a scenario like this: most of the traders will exit there loss trade if not a stop loss have they turn out of the market before and then when market price should pushes enough high, the big turn down will coming soon! So I go with one's gut. But we have no securities. Could be that market price will turn down and never come up again this month. I don't know. For me probabilities seems not so ideal, so for me I stay at the sideline and wait. Time will come and I earn my money - sure enough,...but not at a friday!

Sincerely,

An Introduction to Harami

The word Harami in Japanese means pregnant. A Harami candle formation   is a two candlestick pattern. In an ideal form the first candle has a   long real body and the second candle is a spinning top. The real body  of  the second candle is located within the body of the first candle. In   other words open and close of the second candle are within the open  and  close of the first candle. The Harami pattern is similar to the  "inside  day" Western pattern. If the second candle is a doji then  Harami is  called Harami Cross or  Petrifying Pattern (see image).

http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto.../42_Harami.png

The second candle (i.e. the smaller one) could be a   doji, a bearish candle, or a bullish candle both in bearish and bullish   situations.

Bullish Harami

If the first candle of Harami is a long bearish candle then the   pattern has bullish implications. Especially if the pattern appears at   the bottom of a downtrend then it could be a sign of reversal (see   image).

http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ish_Harami.png

If the second candle is a doji or a bullish spinning   top then the reversal sign could be more reliable but there are times   that even a bearish spinning top could be a good sign of reversal. Since   this pattern is not a reliable one at all times, the best practice is   to use other tools to confirm it. I have personally found Bollinger   Bands (BB) to be a good tool for this purpose. You may also use the   Enhanced Bands indicator which could be even better as combines both BB   and volatility to predict the bottoms and tops of the market.
Bearish Harami

If the first candle of Harami is a long bullish candle then the   pattern has bearish implications. Especially if the pattern appears on   top of an uptrend then it could be a sign of reversal (see image).

http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ish_Harami.png

If the second candle is a doji or a bearish spinning   top then the reversal sign could be more reliable but there are times   that even a bullish spinning top could be a good sign of reversal.

Harami patterns could appear both as continuation and reversal signs.

Thank you FXCube. I also had the opportunity to get some feedback from MrHb30Jr about it. My confusion was created because of my broker which is forex.com does not provide me those indexes in their MT4. So, I didn't know how interpret them. Anyway, Thank you both of guys.

Hey guys,

Just out of curiosity. Any of you guys have a comment about Gold. It is dancing with the highest. I know this guy "gold" is bipolar and schizophrenic. Thank you in advance for your opinions.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi CostaRica

Oil prices seems for me assessable. Gold seems for me absolutely an unratable commodity. I have some shorts but I'm not content with it however much it will run in the win one day.

Silver is at its top at 20.90 an I think that we'll see the 9/10 again in the next months. In longer term (some years) big investment could hype silver up till 100$ or 200$ or even much more. It's out of our hands now!

Hello PhAnTi'

Oh yes it could be really interesting!

I have only a little knowledge about mq4 code just now, may be I will take more time and learn more about it next year. Isn't complicated, may be complex.

Hope that someone is interesting to write an EA and post it here.

May be with CCI(14) tops and bottoms, say the 100/200 line and the upper and lower Bollinger Band at H4 for the first.

Is someone here who is interesting in writing an EA?

Notice:

Trading the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms with a comfortable advanced trading style?

Why wait till the lower Top CCI T2 and not go out at its highest T1?

T1 shows a CCI(14) Top and you could go easy out at this point: 109.97 (Pivot D S2) or 110.15 (murrey math mml7 "Sell Premium Zone"). Why not? If so you have earn your money, simple too,..., may be not the most of possible money! Why? The EMA 10/20 lines was in a strong uptrend (high volatility) and so let the win run and take more risk over and wait a little more, may be with setting a stop loss e.g. at mS2 110.52 after T1 you could have run the win further on. There was a price action down (see the two red candles between DS1 and DPV) but they hadn't triggered the stop loss. The next CCI Top T2 shows then definitely a significant divergence at H4 chart and so it would be better to take out the profit here by not later then.

If you start sweating when you watch the price swings of a product you have invested in, you either have the wrong trading concept, are in the wrong products, or your positions are too big.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
The biggest losses happen after investors make their first big profits.  If you accumulate profits with a proven, tested investment strategy, you  can pride yourself on its success.

However, if you make profits without an investment strategy, you may  lose not only all your profits but your total investment. Unexpected  price moves do not have to mean big losses; they occur because investors  work with the wrong trading concept.

I would trade longer term H4 the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms, may be short term the M15 CCI(14) tops and bottoms with confirming of EMA10/20 crossover. Monthly and Weekly shows a positive divergence. Could be that you'll see the 1.3070 at the next CCI(14) bottom. If volatility should be high may be it could better to wait for a further argument (price action, lower time frames, murrey math, or so).

Hope it helps!

You could have made money with Time Cell Trading the Tops & the Bottoms with XAGUSD H1 also in an upward movement if you have been sold silver at all CCI(14) Tops and have bougt it at all the bottoms. May be you could have earned more money if you have taken a look at the parallel running EMA10/20 lines,... so let your win run and don't go out at every CCI (14) Top. H1 middle line of Bollinger Band should it have pointed out even so.

p.1,  #4

Candles are running down at the lower line of Bollinger Band, say volatility seems to be extremely high. Ergo: Let your win run. RSI was under 0  too and descending. If candles would touches the middle line of BB may be it's time to go out with your trade. I would prefere the pivot points.

113.67 - 112.65 seems for me enough when trading with a M15 chat. So it's time to take out your wins with the help of pivot points or murrey math or when you think okay my wins are for me enough.

--- 帖子 #722 ---

Hi,

First of all, thank u so much for all your input, comments, and help.

Something simple, who is your broker? and do you use Mac or windows?

Thanks,

CostaRica

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Hi CostaRica

Window/Mac

I have 3 Windows PC and 4 Mac PC high speed (and 3 Laptops). One PC is only for writing E-Mails and go at Forexfactory, not for trading the big money. 5 PC are exclusively for forex trading and are solely for managing the 14 actual real accounts at 5 different brokers.

Broker

I change the broker from time to time because I am not really content with all of them. I don't know if it could be dangerous to say which broker I have due to the fact that it could be an easy thing for hackers to find out the additive informations and then they could make me a dangerous problem. May be it's better not to post the brokers here on board. I prefere brokers with a tight spread and a fair play.

Hope it helps!

--- 帖子 #762 ---

Hi PhAnTi'

First: Learn the basics, please. How is CCi(14) calculated at September 21/22 ?. Then look at all these indifferent candles before. Could it be a favored option for a market entry,... after 16 indifferent candles upwrds, when Ema Lines are crossing downwards? How is at this point CCI(14) calculated? So the price action shows many indifferent candles and is moving the middle line of bollinger downwards. Not the best probabilities for making a market entry, is it?. Moreover EMA Lines are crossing downwards (not upwards). Read a little the Market Examples. All will getting clear. TCT is easy and simple to understand.

Could you post the currency pair and the dimension on your chart next time, please.

Thank you!

See chart below, please. All trades have running in the win zone! Don't complicate the trading system, please. Let it easy and simple!

Preferred Trades: P1 (Long), P2 (Long), P3 (Exit & Short), P4 (Short), P5 (Exit & Long), P6 (Long)

Daily chart:

If you take a look at the Daily all will getting clearer. EMA Lines are crossing and moving upwards. May be we could se a range in this environment, say at H1/H4 ups and  downs and ups and downs and are waiting for the next breakout. TCT used a multiple time frame analysis, before the entering of trades. All is written at this thread. You have only to read and think a little about it. It is really simple.

Forex Trend Continuation: The Flag Pattern

Forex traders who use technical analysis should be familiar with the chart patterns that confirm and reinforce the existing trends. Those formations are generally known as continuation patterns. The most common of them are flags, triangles and wedges.
Flag Continuation Pattern

The flag formation gives signals for the direction and the target price.

This chart pattern represents a short consolidation period formed within  a sharp price movement. A support line and a resistance line provide the borders of the consolidation until the price breaks out. These lines are parallel to each other or as in some cases happen slightly converge to one another, which makes the formation  appear as a flag. Additionally, generally the flag is not perfectly flat, but tends  to be sloped in the reverse direction from the slope of the original trend. The sharp trend that comes before  it looks like a flagpole.

http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...on-pattern.gif

The flag continuation pattern is considered complete when the price breaks out in the same direction of the sharp price movement preceding the pattern. The breakthrough should be accompanied by heavy market volume in order to increase the significance of the chart pattern.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Forex Trend Continuation: The Pennant Pattern

Similar to the flag chart formation, the pennant continuation pattern is guided by almost the same principles. The only difference between the two is that the support and resistance lines converge, which makes this continuation pattern to appear as a pennant.

Pennants can be either bullish or bearish. A chart pattern of a bullish pennant is observed when the original trend is bullish as well. On the other hand, a bearish pennant is observed under the conditions of a going down original  trend. In both cases it is vital that the movement of the price  preceding the pennant formation be a solid, steep move.

http://www.forex-trading-gurus.com/a...on-pattern.gif

The pennant direction is not that important as is the case of the flag pattern, though generally the pennant is flat.

The pennant continuation pattern is considered complete when the breakout of the price is in the same direction of the steep price movement prior the formation. Additionally, there has to be heavy market volume during the breakout in order to confirm the chart pattern.

Cable is around 150 pips from a double top and cci shows signs of down turn.

Also forming a saucer pattern which could mean a retrace.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
euro has broken out and since it and cable often travel simular paths, It looks like it could pullback also. How far I dont know. Im inclined to think cable and euro a small pullback and then cable breaks out like euro already has. Of course you need to watch for a pullback bottom and then take them long with a close stop. Im not sure the major downtrend on cable is over.

Any thoughts?

I didnt make it but there is also divergence on the euro 4hr.

Hi porfirio

Excellent charts!,...but your daily data doesn't show any CCI(14) divergence. Isn't it?

Daily shows a divergence (see first chart, please) and the market price is now at the middle line of the weekly BB (see second chart, please). Could be that prices will struggling around here in the next days?. We don't know. May be!

I would take the profit out of the market and would wait.

In a longer term further upside movements till "MA50 weekly" around 1.63 could be also possible.

GBPCHF seems for me a good currency to trade at Weekly and Daily Charts and sometimes the H4.

Hope it helps!

yep its logical

but you define step by step all the details of buy and sell entry conditions.

If you define details me or another  coder will  do this.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hello hipofiz

Oh that would be fine!

Many Thanks.

Step 1

May be it could be the first step to define the CCI Tops and Bottoms...may be in conjunction with the upper and lower lines of Bollinger Band, or we define a 100, 150, 200 Line of CCI Top and a -100, -150, -200 Line for the Bottoms, would say it could depend on the algorithm which could be used..

see further #841,  #842, #843, #844, please.

FXcube

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Step 2

EA should be used at all timeframes, say M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, Weekly, Monthly

I think this point could be difficult if only you'll switch at MT4 through the timecharts. I make an example:

EURUSD: A trader intend to switch at M30, H4 and Daily and at every time if CCI(14) is at his top or his bottom orders will be triggered separately from M30, H4 and Daily. So may be M30 will give a Buy order, so it might be that the Daily EA will give a Sell.

Do you understand what I will explain here?

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Step 3

If the first CCI Bottom is reached the EA don't stop then. Often charts will building a next lower Bottom Level (often we could observe a divergence). At this point the EA have to give the second Buy Order.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Step 4

Exit Orders

by trading the lower timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1)

from all Bottom Buy should be triggered at CCI Top (over 100 or 150 er Line).

May be the first 60% at the first CCI Top and the rest of 40% at the second CCI Topet vice versa.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Step 5

Exit, Sell and Buy Orders at higher timeframes, Daily, Weekly, Monthly (may be H4) should be take place like the chart at #822, say it should be possible, that several buy (or sell) orders at different CCI 14 Bottoms (or Tops) could be done and then one Exit at a CCI 14 Top (or Bottom), may be at once with the next Sell (Buy) Order.

may be then something like this...

An EA works only definite items. We (or you or steve) must determine every step, every process for trading idea.

for example you will to teach a person your idea step by step every process... (crossing and comparison of values is basic term but to execute a process is not )

yes its C++ but to write an EA is more complex than to create an idea

( even steve's a lot of EA' on FF is under development for a couple of weeks, I  follow up nanningbob thread EA for 1 months)

Hello Oliver

see #869, please.

I have trade only the Tops and Bottoms. ...and take a look at PhAnTi's comment, please,  #867, #871

When you take a look at
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Fore...250--day/64861

you can open the History File and take a look at the time Buy/Sell and Exit.

There are some orders from last week and orders from last night.

Often I trade the H4 with regard to Daily and if I could die of boredom I trade some M1/M5 between them.

Some of these orders are posted here on board.

The open orders EURJPY from 18.11. and USDJPY from 19.11 was M1/M5 trading but haven't get any chance to close these ones last week. So I let it run and will hedge these one, if it should be necessary.

In detail I can't remember me. I make a lot of analyses and then if I have found a chart with higher probabilitites I go in - here and there I put these ones at this board.

Hope it helps!

supplement

That you can do. If I trade M30/H1 I take a look at H4 and Daily. So you can trade with the higher trend. Or trade the Market Entries at H4 and Exits at H1 if they are running in the win, or H1 entry and if there will be a trend exit at H4. TCT CCI(14)  Multiple Time Frame is extremely creative, I think. The main issue should be the MM.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Oh yes, of course. Thank you PhAnTi'. I've forget to point it out.

Often you can monitor these support and resistance levels at the higher charts (H4, Daily, may be H1).

Sure!

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Great, thank you for the explanations. Very helpful.

There are two more questions I was thinking about:At what time frames do you look at the Murrey Math lines (together with the CCI tops/bottoms)? When do you use stop losses and when not? In your post #836 you advised using a stop loss for example. In other post you talk about the non-stoploss-concept... Thank you once more.

Oliver

--- 帖子 #870 ---
i'll represtn forexcube from now : D

he doesn't like SLs ....

try to figure out Murrey Math lines on the higher frames, starting with h1 or h4.... M30 M15 murrey lines dont represent strong support/resistance levels , problem : u cannot play them out cause they wont hold often....the levels on the higher frames demonstrate a very strong obstacle :-]

--- 帖子 #871 ---
This example below is a classical one. H1 is showing a divergence and the price action is making the case for a down. In this case [8/8] seems okay for me. If prices would run further upwards I would take the risk over with some enter sells more at [2/8] but would switches at higher timeframes H4 and Daily to consider the situation. Murrey Math seems good in all cases if the chart will tell you this. Sometimes it is H1, H4 and at odd moments Daily and Weekly, (seldom the monthly chart but if so then it could be an extremely great argument for some market actions). It's not a hard rule from me, more an option which I can follow, if price action and the multiple time frame analysis in conjunction with CCI(14) Top or Bottom could give me a clear picture and then Murrey Math could give me one conclusive argument more.

Take a look further at   #9, please.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Empirically 80% of all my loosing trades should run sooner or later in a win. Why cut them in a loosing zone before? The rest of 20% of these trades could pose a threat to an account. But often these trades could be hedged several times in the meantime and with higher lot sizes to counterbalance and moderate the damage. Once time in a month or former there is one day to settle the balance. If so the account go e.g. 20% down, but then you have make a multiple of them before. This is only my personal trading style and I can't it recommend to other traders. I think brokers make here his 70% of all wins, due to the fact that the account holder should often undercapitalized.

If I talk about a stop loss I would denote that if I would set a stop loss then here or there. This is for traders who set a stop loss and they know then my mind.

Hope it helps!

Open Positions

Be careful!

6 Positions à 0.5 Lot USDCHF seems really a little too much for a 60'000.-$ Account. I take the risk over and trade some of them longer term and will earn the carry trades (okay carra trades aren't vera much). If market will go contrary some positions should be hedged. So maximum 30'000.-$ could be risk if market price should go down till 0.8905  (actual 0.9890). If price would run further down till 0.7905 so there could be necessary a sum of 60'000.-$ exclusively for this 6 USDCHF positions if I don't want a undercapitalized account.

Hi FXcube,

your results are amazing...!!

Wow, cannot believe what I see...I hope you do the same trades on your live account...or were the trades high risk?

As the most trades closed today were EURUSD and USDCHF, I would guess you traded M1 timeframe (due to the low spread). Is my guess right?

Keep on doing what you do...I appreciate really much what you share with the community here on FF. There is so much to learn from you.

I like to review your trades every single day and keep on learning the TCT style more and more.

Kind regards,

Oliver

GBPUSD, Daily, 2010 November 24

How to analyse the market?

Use the Multiple Time Frames (MTF)

GBPUSD has work out a divergence. EMA100 seems to be a support line.

Stop Loss: somewhere under this EMA 100 Line.

Take the risk with an enter long at the bottom of Daily CCI(14).

Weekly (#906) and monthly chart (#905) seems a little indifferent. May be good time for Box Trading at H4 till the next breakout, see #904, please.

Multiple Time Frame Analysis

Multiple Time Frame Analysis is the practice of analyzing a currency  pair by looking at the same pair through several different time frames  on charts. The advantage here is that by looking at a larger time frame,  then a smaller time frame, and then an even smaller time frame, the  trader is able to gain a more granular insight as to how the pair is  moving and make a more informed entry into the trade.

Multiple time-frame indicators

by Tomasz Janeczko, amibroker.com

Requirements to run formulas presented in this article:  AmiBroker (any edition,                 any version above 4.41)  any 1-minute intraday                     data source  Introduction

In         classical approach trader chooses his/her “favorite” time interval(s) and       applies tools and indicators in this time frame.

This       approach however generates several questions:
Which           time frame (interval) should I use?      Is           choosen interval the best in terms of trading performance?      If           not, how can I find better intervals?      Once           I have optimum how long will it work?      What           to do when once found optimum changes?     These         questions are traditionally solved using optimization over time frame,         so we build a system that we later test on each and every time frame starting       from 1 minute to say one day and choose the best performing one.

Unfortunately         usefulness of such approach can be questioned because once optimum values         can become invalid very quickly and frequent re-optimization is simply       repetitive curve-fitting over and over again.

So         what is the solution? Should we just stick to our once “favorite” all the       time? Is there any other way?

The idea

The         proposal of the solution that will be presented here can be summarized         in one sentence: instead of using one time frame use all possible time       frames (within some range) at once in the form of composite indicator.

Classic         indicators produce signal in the form of single “buy” or “sell” at a time.         In voting-based multiple time frame indicators we will blend (compose)         the signals coming from hundreds of different time frames into one indicator       that will represent a result of “voting” for buy or sell in different intervals.

Multiple time-frame MACD

The       construction of multiple time-frame indicator consists of 4 stages:

1.       Definition of signals

2.       Generation of signals over multiple time frames

3.       Summing up the signals into composite indicator

4.       Normalization

In       the first example we will show how to calculate multiple time-frame MACD.

In         the first step we define our buy and sell rules. For this example, we will         use MACD system that generates “BUY” signal when MACD is above zero and       “SELL” signal when MACD is below zero.

In         the second step we run MACD over every time frame ranging from 10-minute       to 300 minutes, each interval generating its own buy and sell signals.

In         the third step we count each buy as +1 and each sell as -1 and calculate       sum of those signals coming from different time frames.

And         in the last stage we normalize the indicator by dividing the sum calculated       in previous step by number of time frames we used.

This         way we obtain bounded multiple-timeframe indicator ranging from -1 to +1         that represents a “blend” of signals coming from multiple time frames at         once. Positive values represent composite buy signal while negative values       represent composite sell signal.

Below         is a sample Amibroker code that actually calculates multiple-time frame         MACD. As you can see the coding is pretty simple and short, because of         Amibroker native support for handling multiple time frames. These TimeFrame         functions allow the user to mix different intervals in single formula with         ease. Since the formula is rather computationally intensive we perform         calculation once and store results in artificial data symbol (using AddToComposite         function) that we will use later for plotting (so it does not need to be       re-calculated).
Formula 1. Multiple time-frame MACD. Note:           in order to run this code and calculate multiple time-frame MACD, enter           it into Automatic Analysis (AA) window, go to Settings window, make sure           that Periodicity is set to 1-minute. Then press "Scan" button         in the AA window.
Count = 0;

result = 0;

for( i = 10;     i <= 300; i++ )

{
TimeFrameSet(     i * in1Minute );

m = MACD(12, 26 );
TimeFrameRestore();

m = IIf( TimeFrameExpand(     m, i * in1Minute ) > 0, 1,     -1 );

result = result + m;

Count++;

}

AddToComposite( result     / Count, "~MACD"+Name(), "X" );
Buy=1;

In         the figure below we can see daily chart of ORCL (upper pane) with buy and         sell arrows generated using multiple time-frame MACD and multiple time-frame         MACD indicator plotted in the bottom pane. Buy signal is generated when         MTMACD crosses above -0.5 line and sell is generated when MTMACD drops         below +0.5 line. Note the MTMACD saturation levels at -1 and +1 which indicate         bars when all timeframes voted for sell or for buy.

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...TMACD-ORCL.png

Actual         plotting code is presented below. Note that we are using Foreign function         to retrieve indicator values stored in artificial ticker. That way we don't       need to re-calculate it.
Formula 2. Multiple time frame MACD plot           (indicator) code. Use Formula editor to enter then press "Apply         indicator" to display it.
x = Foreign("~MACD"+Name(),"C");

Plot( x, "MTMACD", colorBlue , styleThick )   ;

PlotGrid(0.5 );
PlotGrid(-0.5);

Extreme overbuy/oversell indicator (Multiple time-frame RSI)

In         second example we will present an indicator that could be called “extreme         overbought/oversell” indicator. It’s construction we will use RSI indicator         to detect overbuy/oversell conditions occuring in different time frames.         Overbuy signal will be generated when 14 bar RSI is above 70 and oversell         will be generated when RSI is below 30. INnthe second step we will generate         RSIs in every interval starting from 5 minute, through 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-,       30, 35- minute interval up to 360 minutes.

In         the third step we will add 1 to the sum if RSI in given time frame is above       70, or subtract 1 from the sum if RSI in given time frame is below 30.

After       calculating entire sum we will divide the result by number of components.

This         will give us bounded indicator in -1… + 1 range, where values near -1 will       signify extreme oversell and values near +1 will signify extreme overbuy.
Formula 3. Multiple time frame RSI. As before,           run the formula in AA window using 1-minute periodicity selected in the         Settings.
Count = 0;

result = 0;

for( i = 5;     i <= 360; i = i     + 5 )

{
TimeFrameSet(     i * in1Minute );

m = RSI();
TimeFrameRestore();

m = TimeFrameExpand(     m, i * in1Minute );

result = result + IIf(     m > 70, 1, IIf(     m < 30, -1, 0 )     );

Count++;

}

AddToComposite( result     / Count, "~RSI"+Name(), "X" );
Buy=1;

The code that plots actual       indicator is as follows.
Formula 4.
x = Foreign("~RSI"+Name(),"C");
GraphZOrder=1;

Plot( x, "MTRSI", colorLightGrey );
Plot( EMA(x, 7 ), "EMA(MTRSI,7)", colorBlue, styleThick );

PlotGrid(1);
PlotGrid(-1);

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTRSI_CSCO.png

In the figure above we can see daily chart of CSCO plus extreme overbuy/oversell (light         gray) and its 7 day moving average (blue).  As we can see from the chart         smoothed MTRSI peaks and troughs precisely show ends of large up trend         and down trend moves. One stunning feature of this indicator is clarity         of trend-ending signals. This indicator is perfect for timing the exits.         As many researches have shown good exit timing is often more important       than entry timing.

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTRSI_AAPL.png

In         this figure above you can see another example of MTRSI with very clear         signals of local maximums during the trend. Even more stunning is the divergence         that develops in the middle of September when prices continue to rise and         MTRSI makes two peaks in clear downtrend. These leading signals helped       to get out of trade just at the very end of very nice up trend.

Multiple time-frame ADX

Using         the same concept we can create other multiple-time frame indicators. For         example MTADX presented in this chart, was calculated by computing 14-bar         ADX values in every time frame starting from 20 minutes upto 360 minutes         with 20 minute increment and then summing them up and dividing by number       of components.
Formula 5. Multiple time-frame ADX calculation
Count = 0;

result = 0;

for( i = 20;     i <= 360; i = i     + 20 )

{
TimeFrameSet(     i * in1Minute );

m = ADX();
TimeFrameRestore();

m = TimeFrameExpand(     m, i * in1Minute );

result = result + m;

Count++;

}
AddToComposite( result     / Count, "~ADX"+Name(), "X" );
Buy=1;
Formula 6. Multiple time-frame ADX plot
x = Foreign("~ADX"+Name(),"C");

Plot( x, "MTADX", colorBlue , styleThick )   ;

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd..._CTADX_NDX.png

This         has yielded to the indicator plotted in second pane. ADX is the indicator         that shows how strong is the trend. As we can see multiple time-frame ADX         very quickly reacts to forming uptrend, much quicker than original 14-day         ADX (shown in the lowest pane). For illustration purposes in the middle         I have inserted 4-day ADX which still lags behind multiple-time frame 14-bar       ADX and is more choppy.

MTADX       shows weakening of market trend way quicker.

This         shows clear advantage of multiple-time frame indicators. They are leading       indicators.

Multiple time-frame, multiple-security composites

As         I have shown previously multiple time frame indicators  often provide leading         signals and this makes them better than  those based on end-of-day data,         however, sometimes they lead  only by very few bars. For example take a         look at multiple  time-frame MACD generated from Nasdaq 100 index compared         to  regular MACD (below). In most cases it leads standard MACD just by 1-3        bars. It is nice, but couldn’t this be nicer?

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTMACD_NDX.png

The         answer is.... Yes they can do better work ... If you trade sector EFTs       or index futures.

When one trades an index or some sector, it is popular practice to  apply indicators         on index data. Index is usually some form of  average of its components.         As an alternative to applying  indicator to market average we can create         average from  indicators calculated separately for each component. As long         as  indicator does not represent simple linear transformation these two          procedures yield to very different results. For example if we assign  „buy”         and „sell” meaning to certain indicator levels we can  implement voting         across securities that build up an index. This  technique is now widely         used among AmiBroker users because its’  built-in support for creating user-definable         composites and the  fact that it requires just one line of code to create       composite in  AmiBroker.

Creation       of composite:
http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...s/image012.gif

But during this research we went further than that. We did not only  created         a multiple-security composite but we have used multiple  time-frame indicators         as components of such composite. So each  "MACD" block in the         schematics above represents multiple-time  frame MACD calculated from single         security.

So this time voting is performed first in time-frame domain and then  in security       domain and results are summed up to construct one  indicator which we can     call multiple time frame MACD composite.

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...CTMACD_NDX.png

Here         is how it looks. The middle pane shows multiple-time  frame MACD composite         calculated from MTMACDs computed for every  Nasdaq100 component separately,       then summed up together and  divided by 100.

As         you can see it is very different from single-security  multiple-timeframe         MACD. It is also very different from regular  MACD calculated from index         data directly. And what is most  important - it leads the market movement       by significantly more  bars than its single-security counterpart.

Strong         divergences show clearly trend change and levels of -0.5 and +0.5 show       strong support and resistance.

http://www.amibroker.com/docs/MTFInd...iteEOD_NDX.png

This         chart shows comparison between composite based on  multiple  time frames       (bottom pane) and composite based on  end-of-day data (middle pane)

It         is quite clear that multiple-time frame composite reacts  much faster and       also divergences shown here are clearer and easier  to interpret.

Multiple         time-frame indicators have zero or negative lag  giving you an early alert       for market reversal and allowing to  trade before reversal actually happens.

AFL implementation is very easy and straightforward thanks to unique  AmiBroker         function AddToComposite. All it requires is one line  of code that how individual component         value is calculated and  one AddToComposite line. Then such code is run       over watch list of  securities in AmiBroker’s Automatic Analysis window.
Formula 6. EOD composite generation. This           formula should  be run on watch list containing the members of Nasdaq         100  index.
AddToComposite( IIf( MACD() > 0, 1, 0), "~~Nasdaq_EOD_MACD", "X");
Buy=0;

In         multiple-time frame case we need to run the code over  previously created         artificial tickers that contain MTMACD  values. So there are two passes:         first pass to create MTMACDs  for components using code presented few minutes       earlier and second  pass using this code that creates actual composite.

Computations         are stored in artificial ticker that can be used  anytime later without         need to repeat calculations over and over  again. This is quite important         considering the fact that  creation of individual MTMACDs for over 100 of       symbols may take  several minutes (depening on computer speed).
Formula 7. Multiple time frame composite           generation.  This formula should be run on the watch list containing only          artificial tickers (starting with ~MACD) generated using Formula 1.
AddToComposite( C, "~~Nasdaq100MT_MACD", "X");
Buy=0;

To         plot multiple time frame MACD composite the following formula should be       used.

Formula 7. Multiple time-frame MACD composite plot
x = Foreign("~~Nasdaq100MT_MACD","C")/100;

Plot( x, "Nasdaq   MTMACD", colorBlue , styleThick )   ;

PlotGrid(0.5 );
PlotGrid(0);
PlotGrid(-0.5);

Advantages and disadvantages

The         multiple time-frame indicators I have presented here have  many important       advantages. First of all they provide leading  trading signals.

Signals         are provided in a clear way (for example extreme  overbuy/oversell shows         clear spikes on trend endings) so they  can be interpreted easily even in         automatic way. Multiple time  frame indicators work on any kind of market         as they basically  use just 1-minute price series. Composite flavour of         multiple  time frame indicators is very useful for trading sector funds        and/or index futures.

There         are also some disadvantages of multiple time frame  indicators but these       are minor computer-related issues.

First         of all these indicators are computationally intensive  as they operate on       lots of data and require often several minutes  to calculate.

Also         they require historical intraday data which may be a bit more expensive       than end-of-day data

And         the last thing is that computations shown here can be  peformed only using         program that is capable of manipulating  multiple time frames at once and         having ability to automatically  compute and store composites (cross-security         sums or averages).  Good news is that AmiBroker is one of such sofwares       and it is not  expensive :-)

Possible         improvements

As you can see multiple time frame indicators have lot of good things  to offer,       but let us think about future possible enhancements.

These improvements may include using different weight to each „vote”.  The simplest         way is to give more weight to longer time frames.  More complex way would         be to use weight that depends on past  performance of particular time-frame.         This way better-performing  time-frames become more important in producing         final signal  than the others (worse-performing). This however resembles          slightly constant re-optimization and such weight modification should be        limited so we don’t end up in one time frame monopolising the  system.

Conclusion

Multiple time frame indicators present interesting alternative to  using      "classic" indicators computed from EOD data. Position and  swing traders     may benefit from including them in their toolbox,  since multiple time frame     indicators react to market changes way  faster than their EOD counterparts     while still filtering most of the  market noise present in smaller time frames.

Counterbalance your account - so can you!

M1 trading could be a good way to counterbalance some open minus positions.

When I saw that "Ger30dec10" was moving in the opposite direction I've make up my mind either I hedge or I enforce "M1 High Lot Size Trading" (HLT). see #912.

...if you trade at the beginner level, ...may be that sometimes it could be a little airbone. May be that there aren't so much traders who could have the basic advanced skills to trade like #912, isn't it?

For an well advanced trader it seems not so dangerous to counterbalance negative positions with "M1 high lot size trading" (HLT) from time to time.

I have make up my mind that "Ger30dec10" could moving down stright away but I don't know the point in time. So I don't want to hedge this position and take the action alternative to settle the minus position with M1 Trading in other currency pairs or commodities, like #912.

Trading Using Multiple Time Frames

by Umashankar Galla

Note: there are many forex  systems that trade with more than 1 time frame. Why? It is usually to  accurately time the entry to make the trade a "high probability" trade.  Some systems however only trade one time frame such as daily systems as  they look for broader and bigger moves in the currency market. Here's  the article by Umashankar: Why do we need to Trade Using Multiple Timeframes?

To improve the efficiency of our trading strategy. We see the major  Trend using a higher time frame than what we intend to use & a lower  Time frame to enter a trade.

Say we want to trade using the Daily Charts. We take the Weekly charts  to see the major trend. Suppose it's an uptrend in a Weekly chart. We  will tend to trade only long positions. We will use entries in the daily  charts to enter long positions only. When sell signals are generated we  will just exit our long positions. I.e. we don't short sell.

Suppose it's a downtrend in a Weekly chart. We will tend to trade only  short positions. We will use a entries in the daily charts to enter  short positions only. When buy signals are generated we will just exit  our short positions. I.e. we don't enter long positions.

Now that we are using two timeframes. Now coming to timing the entry of  trades or adding additional positions. (Pyramiding). We can further use a  Hourly chart to time our entries. Suppose the weekly & daily charts  are in a uptrend. We will enter a long position or an additional long  position when a hourly chart gives us a buy signal. Suppose the weekly  & daily charts are in a downtrend. We will enter a short position or  an additional short position when a hourly chart gives us a sell  signal. This timeframe would not be used to exit the trades. It's solely  to improve the timing for entry. For exits we would use the signals  generated in the daily charts.

Using multiple time frames to trade.

We take three charts of the same security. First is the weekly chart.  Next chart is the daily chart. Third chart is the hourly chart.

We will now use the daily chart to trade. We check the weekly chart for  the weekly trend. Lest assume the weekly trend is up. So based on this  information we will just trade long positions in the daily chart.

We look for a buy opportunity in the daily chart or we can see the hourly chart to enter a long position.

Now for entering additional positions we use buy opportunities in the  hourly chart. We would exit based on the daily chart only, because we  were trading based on the daily chart.

Similarly we can trade short where weekly charts are in a downtrend and  daily chart generates sell opportunity. Additional positions are entered  whenever sell opportunities are generated on the hourly charts.

For Day trading we can use the Hourly, 15 Min and 5 Min charts here we  trade the 15 Min chart. Or we can use 15 Min, 5 Mins and 3 Mins charts  here we trade the 5 Mins chart.

Short Note

If I make the MTFA  I will choose the Monthly, Weekly, Daily And H4 in one group at first and will initially analyse this rhythm. Next I added the lower timeframes like M30m M15, M5 and M1.

Then I ask some question?

Are there any pattern detection?

Which ones could be score stronger?

How many timeframes do I really use by the next market entry (entries)? Select the right ones!

Is there uncetainty about whether...? If yes, then I try to point it out. Will be there profound arguments I avoid this currency pair at the moment. Waiting is the first skill that a trader could learn if he will get a successful trader! If you can't wait than you have to learn this  basic skill with exercices like meditation or so. Keep the market waiting !

Are there any disturbance, turmoil around you or in yourself go out of the market and make some other nice things in your life. The Market can wait. There will be plenty of other chances next time! Why would you destroy yourself with autoaggressive silly behavior...instead of an  inviting, disarming smile?

Don't trade when you add alcoholic drinks. Two times a day it's better to make fruit juice by own pressed fruit with a fruitpress.

Recipe: 1 liter fruit juice -  1 kg carrots, 2 oranges, 2 chubby pineapple slices, half plum-sized of ginger, 1/2 lemon, 4 apples, 1 kiwi.

EURUSD, Daily, 2010 November 25

If daily support line (resistance from 2010.08.08) will be broken further downside movements could be possible, in contrast CCI(14) is at the bottom.

The last monthly candles are struggling around the middle line of Bollinger Band, whereas the weekly bar are just hitting the middle line of BB.

Good time for a M30 trading. Here you can trade the CCI(14) ups and downs (see #921 or more in detail below, please) and wait for a bigger breakout.

If big charts (like Weekly or Monthly, see#920 , please) are reaching imortant fields (e.g. Lines of BB, support or resistance) the chance increases that we could see a range box in the following days.

...so this one closed position was an absolute error!

It has to do that I switch inadvertantly at the PC "enter" bottom out of position (3 PC's were running) during a telephone session.

It's not my spirit waiting over 13 hours with a position to end it with a small loss.

...so what I can say to myself, may be something like this?

EURJPY, H4, 2010 November 25

CCI(14) at a top at H4. Not a real good thing because daily is at its bottom (CCI) but weekly is crossing the zero line (see #927, please). I take the risk over with 2 positions Enter Short near 111.70 (two tenth of a trade, if 1 trade should be 10 positions, themed under "add-up positions, #226).

...even better to trade M15, M30 or H1 with regard at H4 whilst taking into account of the "controverse" output of the Daily (may be we'll see a double CCI(14) daily top next time. We don't know).

Be careful and set a stop loss a little above H4 EMA20 or around 112.03 Pivot (DR1).

Have good sport!

We all have our native language and it is a great honor for me to read your comments here on board.

In Forex Trading we should have learn to calculate only with estimated probabilities, which can't never be the holy grale of a safe investment to 1.0

When I post these multiple time frame analyses I will convey this meaning here on board. Hope it's easy to understand.

How to Use Multi Time Frame Analysis When Trading Forex, Futures, and Stocks

In  our last lesson we learned about support and resistance and how to spot  these levels in the market. We should now have a good understanding of  how to spot trends in the market, some of the components that make up  those trends, and finally how to recognize support and resistance  levels. Now lets tie everything together we have learned thus far with  the final concept of this series, Multi Time frame analysis.

No  matter what time frame you end up using when trading the stock, futures  or forex market or what time frame a particular strategy calls for, it  is important always to have a big picture overview of what is happening  in the market. Although there are exceptions, in general most traders  will tell you that if your trade setup or analysis lines up on multiple  time frames, then the odds of being correct are greatly increased.

Lets  look at a simple example by looking for a trade to place to take  advantage of a trend that we have spotted on a chart. For this example  lets say we are looking at a 5 minute chart of the EUR/USD.

A 5 Minute EUR/USD Chart

http://s1.hubimg.com/u/149744_f520.jpg

A 5 Minute Forex Chart

As  you can see from the above chart if we were just looking at the EUR/USD  5 minute chart then we would note the downtrend in the market and  sticking to the simple strategy of simply following the trend, we would  look for opportunities to sell into the downtrend.

As we want to  have a better feeling for the general direction of the market however  when we place this trade we next take a look at an hourly chart.

A 1 Hour EUR/USD Chart

http://s2.hubimg.com/u/149745_f520.jpg

A 1 Hour Forex Chart

As  we can see from this chart we also spot a longer term downtrend on the  hourly chart thus giving us more confidence in our potential trade into  the downtrend on the 5 minute chart.

Lastly to make sure that we are getting the full picture we pull up a daily chart.

A Daily EUR/USD Chart

http://s3.hubimg.com/u/149746_f520.jpg

A Daily Forex Chart

When  looking at this chart however we see that not only is the EUR/USD in an  uptrend on the daily chart, it is in an extended uptrend. As the daily  chart does not line up with the 5 minute and the hourly chart we may  want to question whether or not to place the suggested downtrend trade  in the face of the large uptrend on the longer term chart.

Now  that we understand how a trading signal in the stock, futures, or forex  market can be considered “stronger” if it lines up on multiple time  frames, a more prudent way to search for potential trades may be to  start by looking at the longer term time frames, and then look for  opportunities on shorter term charts which are in line with what the  longer term charts are showing.

The same concept applies when  looking at support and resistance. In general the more time frames and  the longer the time frame is that a support or resistance level shows up  on the more “valid” that level is considered.

That’s our lesson  for today. You should now have a good understanding of multiple time  frame analysis and how looking at different time frames can give us more  or less confidence in trades we are considering making.

Minimise the open position before week-end could be not so bad!

Daily Silver has reached the middle line of Bollinger Band and Murrey Math [+1/8] "Overshoot Level". So I take the risk over and go out with the Enter Short trade today. May be Silver would falling hard down over the week-end by crossing the double-line . If so then my long order would get a problem and I could have the management next week to counterbalance this position at Monday nov.'29. I don't wish so many open orders at my account over the week-end.

Hi gio.kele

Silver - Careful consideration

Silver shouldn't be the first choice by  undercapitalized accounts. Silver pulverises small accounts earlier than  are believed.

Silver Chart

To improve the efficiency of your trading strategy. You see the major trend using a higher time frame than what you intend to use & a lower time frame to enter a trade. Silver shows at its daily chart a touch down till the middle line of BB. May be it goes now up again. We don't know, but you can follow this price at H4 and M30 or H1 and look if this resistance line (daily EMA20, or H4 EMA100) would be broken further down. If so then probabilities increases for a greater downward movement. But big capital don't give often other traders a clear sign so it could also be that prices will struggling around before it goes a few days later real down. Silver H4 CCI(14) is under 200 line, M5 moves sideways in a range, so I would take a look at M30, H1 and H4 and trade here this indifferent market situation till the breakout down occurs or silver prices would moves up again (see here then E.G. H1 EMA10, if the market price will cross  the H4 EMA10 upwards - now price is underneath). If a big trend will come up you can see this at Daily chart earliest a few days later, but previous in smaller timeframes. In the meantime I would trade the H4, H1. If your investment (Long or Short) are after several days at the winner side and bigger time frame will give you the confirmation then I would let the win run further on.

If you think like this:
"Using multiple time frames to trade.

We take three charts of the same security. First is the weekly chart.  Next chart is the daily chart. Third chart is the hourly chart.

We will now use the daily chart to trade. We check the weekly chart for  the weekly trend. Lest assume the weekly trend is up. So based on this  information we will just trade long positions in the daily chart. We look for a buy opportunity in the daily chart or we can see the hourly chart to enter a long position. Now for entering additional positions we use buy opportunities in the  hourly chart. We would exit based on the daily chart only, because we  were trading based on the daily chart."
..it's okay. But when a counter trend is coming up all this explanation don't help you really forward during the radical change. Then it's better to switch at lower timeframes (H4, H1, M30) during the change (rebuilding phase, radical change, inasmuch as strong momentum tends to break support and resistance, weak momentum does not) and trade approximately the smaller time frames as far as the other (recent, fresh, big) trend will become your road map, from then on familiar trading at higher timeframes can be recommended again.

EURUSD Charts

all okay!

Hope it helps

Nice work with your chart!

Keep it on!

Counter Trend

{ Posted on  3/27/2010 08:53:00 PM     by De_Trainer }

...

Investo-pedia says...  Contrarian investors perform counter-trend trading strategies -  purchasing shares when prices are low and selling when they're high. The  investor receives smaller gains since the full market swing is not  recognized. Many counter-trend investors use momentum indicators to  determine the best times to execute their trades.

The simple way  of counter-trend, that we not recognize the trend, we mostly open  position that opposed from direction of trend like we know the turn  point, as long market have significant movement, counter trend will be  there. When market in sideway condition counter-trend had advantage to  sell at high and buy at low, but when market in trending, counter-trend  must tight the seat-belt.

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jrfv2L8voQ...trendforex.jpg

That pic sure give us illustration of real drawdown, especially for Sell, when using counter-trend in trending condition.

Now, i'll show the sample system of counter-trend using MT4...

I  use Bollinger Band, why bollinger band?? i think this indicator is  reliable to recognize trending or in sideway, in term of Bollinger,  trending is... i generally definite trending as condition when price  goes out from Low or High 'Bollinger Line', it known as 'Abnormal  Condition'. And when the price inside the "cage" of Bollinger Band, the  price is in 'Normal Condition'. Normal Condition is the best time for  counter-trend trading, because we know when price inside the cage of  Bollinger, price will move sideway, in same range movement for a while.

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_jrfv2L8voQ...untertrend.gif

The setup of system :

1. Bollinger Band Green period 20 (default) and Bollinger Band Blue period 60

2. SMA 7 and SMA 10

Rules or trade condition :

1. Make sure price inside Bollinger Band, also Bollinger Band 20 inside the Bollinger 60

2. Make sure both of Bollinger move Flat and not 'Squeeze'

3. Tight the SL because we buy at low sell at high, there's no reason for 100 SL

4. Lock the pips if afraid to get loss, though it small loss

The entry of buy is :

The slow MA crossed the fast MA, the condition of slow MA is up from fast MA.

The entry of sell is :

The slow MA crossed the fast MA, the condition of slow MA is down from fast MA.

Take Profit when MA crossed to opposite from your trade position, or when touch the Low or High Bollinger.

That's it, hope my article give an inspiration... Let's make good pippin...

I couldn't agree with him more!

Counter-Trend trades should only constitute roughly  20% or so of your trades, see  #953, please).

Counter Trend Trades could used an infinite deal more by adavanced trading level. In  my trading career I have make the first real sustained profit after the  third/fourth year of practice, ...and after the fifth/sixth year I have  learned the "ease of money" how to increase the risk (higher lot sizes)  only for a few minutes. Last one you can do without exception by a big  plus account, after you have made big profits before.

When market in sideway condition counter-trend had  advantage to  sell at high and buy at low, but when market in trending,  counter-trend  must tight the seat-belt. ( see  #947, please).

Bollinger Band Counter Trend System

Bei  dem Bollinger Band Counter Trend System handelt es sich um ein sehr  kurzfristiges System, das maximal zwei Tage im Markt ist. Das System  kauft in Trendmärkten (ADX(14) > 22) in stark überverkaufte  Situationen (unteres Bollinger Band um einen Prozentwert unterschritten)  hinein (es werden nur Long Positionen eingegangen), dabei spielt es  keine Rolle, ob es sich um einen Aufwärts- oder Abwärtstrend handelt. Da  das System gerade in Abwärtstrends gegen den Trend kauft, geht man ein  besonderes Risiko ein, man sollte also nur einen geringen Teil des  Gesamtkapitals investieren. Weiterhin sind für das System niedrige  Gebühren und eine ausreichende Liquidität wichtig, um eine geringe  Slippage zu garantieren. Dieses und die grosse Volatilität machen das  System ideal für an der Nasdaq gehandelte Aktien, wobei das System  durchaus auch in anderen Aktienmärkten funktioniert. Das System hätte  auch in der Zeit von Mitte 2000 bis September 2001 mit Long Positionen  an der Nasdaq Geld verdient, obwohl in dieser Zeit die Märkte praktisch  nur eine Richtung kannten, nämlich nach unten.

Trend Trading vs. Counter-Trend Trading

By Todd Mitchell

Dec 11, 2006 - 11:33:00 PM

Many traders, believe it or not, aren't aware of what we're  about to discuss here. Most absolute beginner traders try to catch tops  and bottoms in the market, not even trying to trade the TRENDS. We, like  many other traders first starting attempted to do the same thing. We  know this from not only our own personal experiences, but by teaching  and talking to tens of thousands of traders that they tend to do the  same thing.

Many (if not most) traders feel that by trying to catch a  market top or bottom is where the real money is. We on the other hand  disagree completely. Catching just a little piece of a trend (and  sometimes much larger than a little piece) adds up, not to mention  easier (higher percentages) to do than trying to catch a top or bottom  in the market. So, we thought by including this topic; Trend Trading vs.  Counter-Trend Trading would be very helpful to you. We know this will  give you more insight into both of these types of trades.

Let us first start out by saying that at least 80% of your trades  should be those trading with the TREND (as taught in this Course -  'Trend Determination', etc.). The other remaining 20% or so can  constitute COUNTER TREND (CT) trades. We would highly suggest  concentrating more (at least in the beginning) on the TREND trades as  opposed to trying to pick tops and bottoms (CT trades). By not only  teaching, but by speaking with students, especially beginners, we find  that most traders simply just try to pick tops and bottoms as opposed to  trying to enter the market with the (overall) TREND.

We'll go as far as to say you probably will not become a successful  trader by trying to pick tops and bottoms when you first start off  trading. Counter-Trend (CT) trading takes a lot more experience. Believe  us when we say that you'll not only find trading less stressful, but  much more rewarding and profitable if you simply stick to trading with a  markets (overall) TREND. Look to make consistent profits utilizing the  profit objectives (PO's) taught in this Course -- and of course you'll  occasionally catch the bigger move (by utilizing the 'Trailing Stop'  methods taught in this Course).

Of the 20% or so of trades that may become COUNTER TREND (CT) trades,  80% of those trades should be BUYS. Why Buys? Simply put, because we've  found that BOTTOMS are much easier to pick than tops. If you think  about it, the psychology of most traders are more biased to buying the  market as opposed to selling the market as a whole. Traders in general  seem to be more optimistic rather than pessimistic on the overall  market. We've spoken to thousands of traders that have expressed to us  that they feel more comfortable buying the market as opposed to selling  it. We know that sounds ridiculous, and we agree, but many (if not most)  traders, believe it or not, feel this way. That's one of the reasons  why bottoms seem to be easier to pick than tops - traders are more prone  to Buy than they are to Sell.

Think about it, how many stock traders do you know that actually sell  a stock short? Not many, most stock traders buy stocks in anticipation  of higher prices. When the market gets extremely oversold and drops to  levels where the big money comes in to Buy the market (oftentimes at a  5%, 10% & 15% overall market corrections), you'll oftentimes see the  market move higher (spike up) and continue the markets (stocks) overall  UPTREND .

When the market is in a DOWNTREND, the market not only  drops three times quicker than it rises (making it much more volatile),  but bottoms are put in place much quicker. This is evident in any chart  you look at. On the other hand, when the market is trending up, the  market generally moves much slower and much more gradual in nature.  Therefore, trying to find market tops are much more difficult to do, at  least that's been our personal experience.

So, when attempting to BUY on a Retest of a Low (important), the  market is generally in a Downtrend, and when attempting to SELL on a  Retest of a High (important), the market is generally in an Uptrend. By  knowing these two simple rules will help make Counter-Trend trading much  more predictable in nature, rather than trying to BUY when the market  is in a free-fall, or trying to SELL when the market is going to the  moon. At most, these rules will help prevent you from jumping in front  of a freight train.

Therefore, I suggest waiting for a RETEST OF A HIGH before looking to  go Sell Short. Conversely, wait for a RETEST OF A LOW before looking to  go Long. Remember, Counter-Trend trades should only constitute roughly  20% or so of your trades. As mentioned before, CT trades are definitely  more difficult than trading with the markets overall TREND.

A General Rule Of Thumb: When a market is Trending Up, the market  tends to be a lot less volatile than when a market is Trending Down.  Therefore, generally speaking a Down Trending market is much more  volatile than when a market is trending up. A market falls roughly three  times quicker than it rises.

Forex Trading - Counter Trend Trading

Statistics like "the market only trends 30% to 33% of the time" are  thrown around. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. But suppose  that the markets trended half of the time. That would still mean the 50%  of the time the markets were range-bound.

I further suspect that  the numbers above are correct because of the number of small traders in  the forex market. Small traders have a way of disrupting trends. (That's  why the large institutional traders don't like them!).

One way or  another, however, we know that the market is trendless a significant  amount of time. If you continue to try to trade a trend system during  these times, you'll either get no trades (if you're lucky), or you'll  get a lot of choppy losing trades.

A better way to go about this  is to use a counter-trend trading system. A counter-trend system looks  to do the "impossible". It looks for the high and low in a market. It  figures that if it finds a high or low, the market will reverse from  there (because it's trendless) and you'll have a good trade.

So  what is a good counter trend trading system? I'd recommend starting with  Bollinger bands. The basic principle is to trade tags off of the upper  and lower bands.

However, if the market is in a trend, you'll get eaten alive. So it's necessary that the bands be totally flat or almost flat.

Yet,  still I'd add an oscillator like Stochastic oscillator to help confirm  tops and bottoms. One of the beauties of a counter trend system is the  ability to use very tight stops. You'd place a stop just outside of the  band that had just been tagged. Shoot for a profit target that's just  under the middle line of the bands.

Monthly and Weekly are struggling around the middle line of BB (see  #955 , please) so chances could also be for a sideway correction in the following days. We don't know! ... but if so then range box trading could be the first choice. It's just one aspect of this marvellous currency pair.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

Hi!  We're Boris Schlossberg and Kathy Lien, and we've been  making people money in Forex for over a decade. As Directors of  Currency Research at GFT and long-time Investopedia.com  contributors, we've seen our share of wins and losses... Thankfully,  over the years, we've also been able to learn from our less glamorous  predictions and come up with a currency   trading system that has earned  us a very respectable success rate on Forex trades.

Today, we're sharing our Forex trading system with you.  We're  going to show   you how to analyze the movements of any currency pair  using a simple checklist   of five key currency-moving factors.  These are the same   factors that we use to analyze our own Forex picks.

Why Forex?

Although trading currencies originated as a way to purchase foreign goods and   services, investors soon learned that there are huge speculative   returns  to be made by predicting the value of international   currencies.   Today, those who use the Forex market as an investment vehicle    outnumber those who trade currencies to expedite world trade.  In fact,  as of   December 2006, 80% of all trades in the currency market are made  by investors or   investment entities out to make a quick return on their extra   cash.

The Forex market is the most prolific market in  the world,   attracting trillions of dollars per day from central banks,  corporations, hedge   funds, and individual speculators.  This fast-paced  market   operates 24/7, 5 days a week, beginning with trade in  Wellington, New Zealand,   and continuing on to Sydney, Australia;  Tokyo, Japan; London, England; and New   York, New York before the whole  cycle begins again.

Forex is exciting, and with the right guidance and a bit of luck you can earn   500%, 600%, even 2000% returns. But Forex is not for everyone. If you   prefer the penny slots to the high roller tables, then the high-stakes world of Forex trading is probably not for you.  Forex is best traded   with money you have allocated as risk capital --   money you don't need for day to day expenses.

So, if you'd like to spice up your more secure investments with a  pinch of   adrenalin and a dash of risk, try a few Forex trades. But  first, let us show you   how you can gain an edge in the market with  the...

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

Key Factor 1.  Interest Rates.

We use two methods to   profit from the difference in countries' interest rates:  interest income capital appreciation  Generating interest income.

Every currency in the world comes attached with an  interest rate that is set   by its country’s central bank. All things  being equal, you should always buy currencies from countries  with high-interest rates and finance these   purchases with currency  from countries with low-interest rates.

For example, as of the fall of 2006, interest rates  in the United States   stood at 5.25%, while rates in Japan were set at  .25%.  You could have taken   advantage of this rate difference by  borrowing a large sum of Japanese yen,   exchanging it for US dollars,  and using the US dollars to purchase bonds or CDs   at the US 5.25%  rate.  In other words, you could have borrowed money at .25%,   lent it  out at 5.25%, and made a 5% return. Or you could save yourself all the    hassle of becoming a money lender by simply trading the currency   pair to affect the same transaction.
Generating income from capital appreciation.

As a country's interest rate rises, the value of the country's   currency also tends to rise -- this phenomenon gives you a chance to   profit from your currency's increased value, or capital appreciation.

In the case of the USD/JPY spread in 2005 and 2006,  as the US interest rates   stayed higher than Japan's, the dollar  continued to increase in value.    Investors who traded yen for dollars  gained from interest income (as explained   in the section above) as  well as the US dollar's capital appreciation.

Between                                January 2005 and November 2006, as the spread between US and                                Japanese interest rates widened, so did the spread between                                the currency values.  A wide spread in currency values                                provides investors with a ripe opportunity to earn income                                through both interest income and capital appreciation.

Interest Rates Spark a 700 Point Rally

Another great example of the power of interest  rates in the currency market   occurred in August of 2006. At that time,  the Bank of England surprised the   market by raising its short-term  rates from 4.5% to 4.75%.  Interest rates for   Japan were still at a  low .25%.

The rise in England's interest rates widened the  interest rate differential   on the popular GBP/JPY cross from 425 basis  points to 450 basis   points. Investment money flowed into Great  Britain as traders bought up pounds   to take advantage of the new  spread. As the demand for the GBP increased, the   value of the GBP  increased, and the spread between the currencies   increased. This  domino effect lead to a 700-point rally in the   GBP/JPY over the next three weeks.

When the Bank                                of England raised short-term interest rates in August 2006,                                it lead to a 700-point rally in the GBP/JPY over the next                                three weeks.

80 Points in Less than 24 Hours

More recently, we have used interest rate differentials to successfully   predict several profitable trades for Forex Advisor members.

The concept of interest rates can be used to trade  currencies using both   long- and short-term perspectives. On a  long-term basis, we look for major   themes.  On a short-term basis, we  look for surprises in the   news that shift the market’s interest rate expectations. We were able   to make two winning trades  based on short-term interest rate   flows in the Australian  dollar/Japanese yen (AUD/JPY) currency pair on January   24, 2007.

The trigger for our trade was the surprise drop in  Australian consumer prices   during the fourth quarter. The market was  looking for hot inflation numbers but   instead they received cold  ones. Low inflation numbers meant the central bank of   Australia was  not likely to raise interest rates as expected. This news sent the    Australian dollar tumbling hard against the Japanese yen, as traders  speculated   that the interest rate differential between the two currencies   would no longer grow.

The first trade we made on January 24 banked us 45  points. We took profit   before the currency pair retraced and then sold  it again when it showed further   signs of weakness.  The second  January 24 trade produced an additional 35 points   for a total of 80 points.

By predicting the affect of unexpectedly low                              inflation on the Australian dollar, we made two winning                              trades on January 24.  Combined, these trades netted us                              80 points in one day.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them
Key Factor 2.  Economic Growth.

The next factor you need to consider when predicting a  country's currency   movements is its economic growth. The stronger the  economy, the greater the   possibility that the central bank will raise  its interest rates to tame the   growth of inflation. And the  higher a country's interest rates, the   bigger the likelihood that  foreign investors will invest in a country's   financial markets.  More  foreign investors means a greater demand for   the country's  currency. A greater demand results in an increase in a currency's    value.

Hence, a ripple effect: economic growth inspires higher  interest   rates inspires more foreign investment inspires greater  currency demand which   inspires an increase in the currency's value.

How Anemic Economic Growth Crashed EUR/USD 2,000 Points

For a good example of the impact of economic growth on the  direction of   currency rates, let’s look at the EUR/USD from 2005 to  2006. Economic growth is   best measured by a country's Gross Domestic  Product, or GDP. The United States   and Eurozone represent two of the  most prosperous regions in the world with GDPs   running at $13 trillion  and $11 trillion respectively.

In 2005 and 2006, the difference in growth rates  between the   two major economic powers was clearly reflected in  currency movements. In 2005,   the Eurozone lagged significantly behind  the United States in economic growth,   averaging an anemic 1.5% rate  throughout the year while the US expanded at a   healthy 3%  rate. Consequently, investment capital flowed from Europe to   the US  and the EUR/USD dropped by nearly 2,000 basis points by the end   of  2005. In 2006, however, Eurozone growth perked up while US growth began  to   slow. At the end of 2006, Eurozone GDP actually overtook US growth  rates,   causing the EUR/USD to rally.

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig3.gif  Click  Here for Larger Image In 2005, The    EUR/USD plummeted as  Eurozone showed little economic    growth compared to the US GDP.  In 2006, as the EZ GDP      rallied, so did the EUR/USD.

We've used GDP's to forecast trends on several more Forex trades in  the   past. One great example is our November 14, 2006, United States  dollar/ Japanese   yen trade (USD/JPY).

67 Points in Four Hours

In the middle of November 2006, hurt by the contraction in its  housing   sector, the US economic data began to deteriorate. Rumor had  it that the US   might lower interest rates in the first quarter of 2007, which   would encourage foreign investors to look elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the Japanese economy was buoyed by the weak yen that  made Japanese   products affordable internationally and helped spur  double digit growth in   exports.  On November 14, 2006, the Japanese  GDP printed at much better than   expected -- 2% versus the 1%  forecast.  We decided to take advantage of the strength of the Japanese economic growth  vs. the relatively   weak economic outlook in the US, so we went short  USD/JPY at 117.82. As we   hoped, that morning, in sharp contrast to  Japan, US retail sales produced very   weak numbers and the USD/JPY pair  collapsed.  We were able to collect 67   points on the trade in less than four hours.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them
Key Factor 3.  Geo-Politics.

Do you hate the business section? Do your eyes glaze over at the  mere mention   of economic data and mind-numbing accounting  numbers? Fear not. The currency   market is the only market in the world  that can be successfully traded on   political news as well as economic  releases. Because currencies represent countries rather than companies,  they are political as well as   economic assets and are therefore very  responsive to any disturbance in the   political landscape.

The key to understanding speculative behavior with respect to any    geopolitical unrest is that speculators run first and ask questions  later. In   other words, whenever investors fear any threat to their  capital, they will   quickly retreat to the sidelines until they are  certain that the political risk   has disappeared. Therefore, the  general rule of thumb in the currency market is   that politics almost always trumps economics. The  history of FX   is littered with examples of political trades. Let’s  take a look at some   examples over the past few years.

No-Confidence Vote Depresses   LoonieThe end of May 2005 was not a happy time   for the Liberal Party  government of Canada’s Prime Minister, Paul Martin. After   having  guided the country to its best economic performance in 30 years, Martin    was facing the fight of his life as his party prepared for a  no-confidence vote   stemming from accusations of past Liberal Party  corruption.

Meanwhile, Canada’s economy was becoming a star performer, spurred  by the   massive rises in the price of oil. As the number one exporter  of crude to the   US, Canada was benefiting mightily from this newfound  wealth. Yet despite the   great economic news, the Canadian dollar remained weak against   the greenback as traders worried about the implications of the fall of the   Liberals.

On May 26, 2005, Martin’s government survived the no-confidence vote and the Canadian dollar rallied,  causing the USD/CAD* to plunge 200   points in less than a week as the  market once again focused on Canada’s stellar   economic fundamentals.

*The USD/CAD pair trades inversely.

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig4.gif  Click  Here for Larger Image Despite strong                      economic performance, the Canadian dollar remained weak                      until Martin survived the no-confidence vote and the                      Canadian political climate settled.
BoJ Governor Fukui Responsible for Floundering   YenAt the beginning of June 2006, Bank of Japan   Governor Fukui revealed  to the Diet that he had invested 10 million yen in 1999   in a fund  founded by financier Yoshiaki Murakami. Murakami was later indicted on    charges of insider trading and although Fukui was not involved in any  illegal   activity, the mere appearance of impropriety in  image-conscious Japan greatly   damaged his reputation.

As the principal of Japan’s monetary policy during its recovery  from a   decade-long battle with deflation, Fukui was considered one of  the most powerful   men in the currency markets. His forced resignation  would do great   damage to the prospects of further recovery in Japan.

Meanwhile, Japanese economic data continued to show stellar economic   performance  as exports and business investment continued to grow,   unemployment  reached decade-long lows, and consumer sentiment improved.  Talk    spread through the markets that Japan would soon abandon its  zero-interest rate   policy and would actually have positive interest  rates for the first time this   century.

Despite all the positive speculation, the yen floundered,    continuing to decline against the dollar as traders feared that Fukui  would have   to step down. Fukui stolidly refused, and as the furor  passed and the market   realized that he would stay on, the yen’s  strength returned, showing once again   that when it comes to  currencies, politics can often be more important than   economics.

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig5.gif  Click  Here for Larger Image Despite                        positive speculation and strong economic reports, the                        Japanese yen did not regain strength until investors                      realized that Fukui would not resign.

If you enjoy predicting changes to the political  landscape, your   talents could be well utilized as a Forex trader.   Recently, we predicted a   strengthening of the Canadian dollar and  earned close to 70 points in less than   24 hours. At 10 to 1 leverage  you could have profited along with us, making a 7% return or $700 on a $10,000 trade.
How OPEC Made Us 70 Points Geopolitical risk can mean wars, terrorist attacks,  or missile   launches, but it can also relate to milder yet still  politically powerful events   such as G7 meetings and OPEC  announcements. In October 2006, Saudi Arabia   announced that they would  back OPEC’s plans to cut oil   production by one  million barrels a day after oil prices dropped more   than 10% in just  seven trading days. The cuts were to take effect on November 1,   2006,  with more to come in December.   As Canada is a major exporter and producer of oil, we believed   that this policy change would be very positive  for the Canadian   dollar. Therefore we went short the US dollar and  long the Canadian on October   19, 2006. Over the next 24 hours, based  upon the geopolitical theme, we earned   close to 70 points on the trade.

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/figb3.gif Click  Here for Larger Image                           United States dollar vs. Canadian dollar, October 19,                          2006.                           Knowing that OPEC's announcement would affect Canadian                        currency allowed us to gain 70 points on October 19.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them
Key Factor 4.  Trade and Capital Flows

Before you make your final prediction about the trend of a country's   currency, you should take a moment to categorize the country  as   dependent on either trade flow or capital flow. Trade flow refers  to how much   income a country earns through trade. Capital flow refers  to how much investment   a country attracts from abroad.  Some countries  are sensitive to trade flows,   while others are far more dependent on  capital flows.

Countries whose currency strength depends on their trade   flows include: Canada Australia New Zealand Japan Germany          These countries achieve a large portion of their growth through the  export of   various commodities. In the case of Canada, oil is the  primary source of   revenue. For Australia, industrial and precious  metals dominate trade, and in   New Zealand, agricultural goods are a  crucial source of income. Trade flows are   also important for other  export-dependent countries such as Japan and Germany.

For countries such as the US and UK, which have large liquid investment   markets, capital flows  are of far greater importance. In these   countries, financial services  are paramount. In fact, in the US, financial   services represented 40%  of the total profits of the S&P 500.

The United States also serves as a perfect example of why it is  crucial to   understand which flows affect which country in order to  effectively analyze the   direction of currencies. On the surface, the  US currency, with its record   multi-billion dollar trade deficit and  near $1 trillion current account deficit   should depreciate  significantly.  However, that has not been the case. As the   chart  below illustrates, the US has been able to attract more than enough  surplus capital from the rest of the world to offset the negative  effects of its massive trade deficits.

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig6.gif   Click  Here for Larger Image The US has massive trade                      deficits.  However, its currency remains strong because                      it consistently attracts large amounts of investment capital                      (capital flow).

For the time being, trade-flow deficits do not matter to the  dollar. However,   should the US become unable to attract enough capital  flow to offset its   deficits, the currency may weaken.

Understanding the influence of trade and capital flows has  been important to   a number of our trades, including our New Zealand  dollar/United States dollar   (NZD/USD) trade on January 22, 2007.

Uridashi Bond Prediction Returns 40 Pips

New Zealand has one of the highest interest rates in the  developed world (as   of January 2007 it was 7.25%), and because of that  fact, it is a major   destination for capital flow. On January 22,  2007, there was talk of Uridashi bonds being issued to  the benefit of the NZD.    Uridashi bonds are issued when companies want  to denominate their debt in a   higher yielding currency and then offer  it to Japanese investors. These are   popular because the yield offered  is far higher than the yield that Japanese   investors can earn at  home, which is less than 1%.

We anticipated that the week’s Uridashi issuances would  inspire capital flow   into New Zealand as investors purchased the bonds  in New Zealand dollars. Once   we made this prediction, we had to  decide which New Zealand currency pair we   would trade to best take  advantage of the movement of the New Zealand dollar. We   considered  both the NZD/USD pair and the NZD/JPY.

We decided to go long the New Zealand dollar against the US  dollar instead of   against the Japanese yen. The risk/reward ratio to  go long NZD/JPY versus   NZD/USD was not as attractive. Our stop in the  NZD/USD was more conservative   than the risk we would have assumed in  NZD/JPY. Therefore, we went long NZD/USD   and banked 40 points over the next 24 hours.

We traded the New Zealand dollar / United                      States dollar on January 22.  The trade returned 40                      points in 24 hours.

http://www.investopedia.com/forex/five-things-that-move-currency-market/free_report_pg6.aspx

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them
Key Factor 5.  Mergers and Acquisitions

While merger and acquisition activity is the least important factor  in   determining the long-term direction of currencies, it can be the  most powerful   force in staging near-term currency moves. Merger  and   acquisition activity occurs when a company from one economic  region wants to   make a transnational transaction and buy a corporation  from another country.

If, for example, a European company wants to buy a Canadian asset  for $20   billion, it would have to go into the currency market and  acquire the currency   to affect this transaction. Typically, these  deals are not price sensitive, but time sensitive  because the acquirer may have a date by which   the transaction is to be  completed.  Because of this underlying dynamic, merger   and  acquisition flow can exert a very strong temporary force on FX trading,    sometimes skewing the natural course of currency flow for days or  weeks.

If you keep abreast of international merger and acquisitions, you  may be able   to predict short-term fluctuations in FX. In late 2006,  for example, Canadian   economic data showed a great deal of  weakness. Yet large demand for Canadian   corporate assets from the  Asia, Middle East, and Europe overrode the financial   reports and kept  the USD/CAD at all-time lows*.

*USD/CAD trades inversely

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/fig7.gif   Click  Here for Larger Image Although economic data indicated USD/CAD  should rally, the pair stayed at all-time lows due to a  large number of foreign investors acquiring Canadian dollars  to purchase Canadian equities.

In November of 2006, we made a healthy profit by predicting a  backward   acquisition effect: After a surprising government  announcement, money that had   been used to purchase equities in Canada,  reversed flow and headed out of the   country.

Canada Loses Investors, Inspires Big Forex   Gains

Merger and acquisition activity can be a powerful but  sometimes stealthy   driver of demand in the currency market. When a  country’s capital assets such as   equities, suddenly find favor from  the rest of the world, they indirectly affect   pricing in the foreign  exchange market as dealmakers first have to buy   the country’s currency before  they can buy the stock. However, woe unto   any currency when this  situation reverses. Such was the case with USD/CAD in   November 2006.

In the fall of 2006, Stephen Harper's newly elected conservative government   made a shocking announcement  that the very popular Canadian   income trusts which enjoyed certain  tax advantages would be taxed just like   other Canadian securities. The  Harper government exacerbated the situation by   not grandfathering any  of the long-term investors who already held positions in   income  trusts.

We thought the impact of this news would be highly negative to the Canadian   dollar as foreign capital would quickly flow out  of the   country.  Despite lackluster US economic news at the time, we  thought a USD/CAD   trade would be profitable because news that affects  immediate investment flows   typically overwhelms any day to day  economic data. Therefore, on November 1,   2006 we went long USD/CAD at  1.1290 and were able to bank 45   points in just a few hours.

http://i.investopedia.com/forex/free_report/figb6.gifClick  Here for Larger Image United  States dollar vs. Canadian dollar, November, 2006.   As investment dollars flowed out of  Canada, the USD/CAD trade earned us 45 points.

At 10 to 1 leverage you  could have profited $450 on a $10,000  investment on the November USD/CAD trade  -- that's a 4.5% profit in a  matter of hours.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

The basic building blocks  of Forex analysis are relatively  simple to understand. Interest rates,  economic growth, politics, trade  and capital flows, and merger and acquisition  activity are the five  primary forces that move prices in the currency  market. However, while  the factors that drive trade are straightforward,  actual currency  trading can be very tricky.

To forecast the Forex  market, you must be able to predict the endless interplay  of each of the  five forces affecting a currency pair. A currency pair  typically driven by  economic growth may suddenly be overtaken by  influences in trade flows or  short-term acquisitions. A pair that seems  sure to fluctuate with interest  rates may unexpectedly be held back by  investors' response to political  unrest.

Some investors enjoy solving the puzzle themselves -- spending  hours and years analyzing the complex  cause and effect relationships  between a country's economics, politics, and  currency strengths. Others  are more interested in reaping the potential  rewards, without all the  hard work.  If you are one of the latter, it  makes sense for you to  find a qualified Forex analyst and follow their  lead.

Forex: Should You Be Trading Trend Or Range?      by Boris Schlossberg,

Whether trading stocks, futures, options or FX, traders confront the single most important question: to trade trend or range?  And they answer this question by assessing the price environment; doing  so accurately greatly enhances a trader's chance of success. Trend or  range are two distinct price properties requiring almost diametrically  opposed mindsets and money-management techniques. Fortunately, the FX  market is uniquely suited to accommodate both styles, providing trend  and range traders with opportunities for profit. Since trend trading is  far more popular, let's first examine how trend traders can benefit from  FX.

Trend

What is trend? The simplest identifiers of trend direction are higher lows in an uptrend and lower highs in a downtrend. Some define trend as a deviation from a range as indicated by Bollinger Band "bands" (see Using Bollinger Band "Bands" to Trade Trend in FX). For others, a trend occurs when prices are contained by an upward or downward sloping 20-period simple moving average (SMA). Get In Early

Regardless of how one defines it,  the goal of trend trading is the same - join the move early and hold the  position until the trend reverses. The basic mindset of trend trader is  "I am right or I am out?" The implied bet all trend traders make is  that price will continue in its present direction. If it doesn't there  is little reason to hold onto the trade. Therefore, trend traders  typically trade with tight stops and often make many probative forays into the market in order to make the right entry.

Liquidity

By  nature, trend trading generates far more losing trades than winning  trades and requires rigorous risk control. The usual rule of thumb is  that trend traders should never risk more than 1.5-2.5% of their capital on any given trade. On a 10,000-unit (10K) account trading 100K standard lots, that means stops as small as 15-25 pips  behind the entry price. Clearly, in order to practice such a method, a  trader must have confidence that the market traded will be highly liquid.

Of  course the FX market is the most liquid market in the world. With  US$1.6 trillion of average daily turnover, the currency market dwarfs  the stock and bond markets in size. Furthermore, the FX market trades 24  hours a day five days a week, eliminating much of the gap risk  found in exchange-based markets. Certainly gaps sometimes happen in FX,  but not nearly as frequently as they occur in stock or bond markets,  so slippage is far less of a problem.

High Leverage - Large Profits
When trend traders are correct about the trade, the profits can be enormous. This dynamic is especially true in FX where high leverage greatly magnifies the gains. Typical leverage in FX is 100:1, meaning that a trader needs to put down only $1 of margin  to control $100 of the currency. Compare that with the stock market  where leverage is usually set at 2:1, or even the futures market where  even the most liberal leverage does not exceed 20:1.

It's not unusual to see FX trend traders double their money  in a short period if they catch a strong move. Suppose a trader starts  out with $10,000 in his or her account, and uses a strict stop-loss rule  of 20 pips. The trader may get stopped out  five or six times, but if he or she is properly positioned for a large  move - like the one in EUR/USD between Sept and Dec 2004 when the pair  rose more than 12 cents, or 1,200 pips - that one-lot purchase could  generate something like a $12,000 profit, doubling the trader's account in a matter of months. (For background reading, see The Most Popular Forex Currencies.)

The Market Always Wins

Of  course few traders have the discipline to take stop losses  continuously. Most traders, dejected by a series of bad trades tend to  become stubborn and fight the market, often placing no stops at all.  This is when FX leverage can be most dangerous. The same process that  quickly produces profits can also generate massive losses. The end  result is that many undisciplined traders suffer a margin call and lose most of their speculative capital.

Trading  trend with discipline can be extremely difficult. If the trader uses  high leverage he or she leaves very little room to be wrong. Trading  with very tight stops can often result in 10 or even 20 consecutive stop  outs before the trader can find a trade with strong momentum and  directionality.

Bound to a Range

For this  reason many traders prefer to trade range-bound strategies. Please note  that when I speak of ‘range-bound trading' I am not referring to the  classic definition of the word 'range'. Trading in such a price environment involves isolating currencies that are trading in channels,  and then selling at the top of the channel and buying at the bottom of  the channel. This can be a very worthwhile strategy, but, in essence, it  is still a trend-based idea - albeit one that anticipates an imminent countertrend. (What is a countertrend after all, except a trend going the other way?)

Range

True  range traders don't care about direction. The underlying assumption of  range trading is that no matter which way the currency travels, it will  most likely return back to its point of origin. In fact, range traders  bet on the possibility that prices will trade through the same levels  many times, and the traders' goal is to harvest those oscillations for  profit over and over again.

Clearly range trading requires a  completely different money-management technique. Instead of looking for  just the right entry, range traders prefer to be wrong at the outset so  that they can build a trading position.

Putting it into Practice

For  example, imagine that EUR/USD is trading at 1.3000. A range trader may  decide to short the pair at that price and every 50 pips higher, and  then buy it back as it moves every 25 pips down. His or her assumption  is that eventually the pair will return to that 1.3000 level again. If  EUR/USD rises to 1.3500 and then turns back down hitting 1.3000, the  range trader would harvest a handsome profit, especially if the currency  moves back and forth in its climb to 1.3500 and its fall to 1.3000.

However,  as we can see from this example a range-bound trader will need to have  very deep pockets in order to implement this strategy. In this case  employing large leverage can be devastating since positions can often go  against the trader for many points in a row and, if he or she is not careful, trigger a margin call before the currency eventually turns around.

Solutions for Range Traders

Fortunately,  the FX market provides a flexible solution for range trading. Most  retail FX dealers offer mini lots of 10,000 units rather than 100K lots.  In a 10K lot each individual pip is worth only $1 instead of $10, so  the same hypothetical trader with a $10,000 account can have a stop-loss  budget  of 200 pips instead of only 20 pips. Even better, many dealers allow  customers to trade in units of 1K or even 100-unit increments. Under  that scenario, our range trader trading 1K units could withstand a  2,000-pip drawdown  (with each pip now worth only 10 cents) before triggering a stop loss.  This flexibility allows range traders plenty of room to run their  strategies.

In FX, almost no dealer charges commission. Customers simply pay the bid-ask spread.  Furthermore, regardless of whether a customer wants to deal for 100  units or 100,000 units, most dealers will quote the same price.  Therefore, unlike the stock or futures markets where retail customers  often have to pay prohibitive commissions on very small size trades,  retail speculators in FX suffer no such disadvantage. In fact a  range-trading strategy can be implanted on even a small account of  $1,000, as long as the trader properly sizes his or her trades.

Bottom Line
Whether  a trader wants to swing for homeruns by trying to catch strong trends  with very large leverage or simply hit singles and bunts by trading a  range strategy with very small lot sizes, the FX market is  extraordinarily well suited for both approaches. As long as the trader  remains disciplined about the inevitable losses and understands the  different money-management schemes involved in each strategy, he or she  will have a good chance of success in this market.

Five Key Factors that Move the Forex Markets -- and How to Profit from Them

We decided to go long the New Zealand dollar against the US  dollar instead of   against the Japanese yen. The risk/reward ratio to  go long NZD/JPY versus   NZD/USD was not as attractive. Our stop in the  NZD/USD was more conservative   than the risk we would have assumed in  NZD/JPY. Therefore, we went long NZD/USD   and banked 40 points over the next 24 hours.

Hi Forexcube,

As usual your postings are very interesting.

Do you mind to talk more about risk reward ratios?, Where can you find risk reward ratios (in numbers) on  a specific currency and/or pair? Is risk/reward ration same as risk aversion/apetite? Risk sentiment?

Thank you,

Bcarbon

Hi Bcarbon

Nice to hear from you. It's a pleasure for me to point it out in detail in the following days, ... to be headlined "Risk/Reward Ratio".

At first I will copy some definition, may be monday or tuesday, any more I will qualify some aspects the pros and cons and in addition I will explain how traders can assign the R-R-R factor to CCI(14) Tops & Bottom Trading which was one of my principle reasons why Time Cell Trading was full-fledged. I hope that this procedure will receive your endorsement.

Kindest regards

The Risk-Reward Ratio

By John Russell, About.com Guide

Know your Risk: The Risk-Reward Ratio

Risk is a part of trading. Every trade carries a certain level of  risk. Every trader must know the amount of risk that is being assumed on  each trade.  Knowing the amount of risk on each trade is one way to  limit it and to protect your trading account. The best way to know your  risk is to determine the risk-reward ratio. It is one of the most  effective risk management tools used in trading.

The risk-reward ratio is a parameter that helps a trader to determine  the level of risk in a trade. It shows how much a trader is risking  versus the potential reward (or profit) on a trade. While this may seem  simplistic, many traders neglect taking this step and often find that  their losses are very large.
How to Determine the Risk-Reward Ratio?

The first step is to determine the amount of risk. This can be  determined by the amount of money needed to enter the trade. The cost of  the currency multiplied times the number of lots will help the trader  to know how much money is actually at risk in the trade. The first  number in the ratio is the amount of risk in the trade.

The reward is the gain in the currency price that the trader is  hoping to earn from the currency price movement. This gain multiplied  times the number of lots traded is the potential reward. The second  number in the ratio is the potential reward (or profit) of the trade.

Examples

Here are a few examples of the risk-reward ratio: If the risk is $200 and the reward is $400, then the risk-reward ratio is 200:400 or 1:2. If the risk is $500 and the reward it $1,500, then the risk-reward ratio is 500:1500 or 1:3. If the risk is $1,000 and the reward is $500, then the risk-reward ratio is 1000:500 or 2:1.  What is a Good Risk-Reward Ratio?

The minimum risk-reward ratio for a Forex trade is 1:2. However, a  larger ratio is better. An acceptable risk-reward ratio for beginning  traders is 1:3. Any number below 1:3 is too risky so the trade should be  avoided.  Never enter a trade in which the risk-reward ratio is 1:1 or  the risk outweighs the reward.

Many experienced trader will only enter trades in which the  risk-reward ratio is 1:5 or higher. This requires that the trader wait  for a trade with this ratio, but the reward is worth it.  A higher  risk-reward ratio is a good idea in case the currency does not make the  anticipated price movement. However, if the trader uses a lower  risk-reward ratio, there is very little room for smaller price movements  and the amount of risk will increase.

The risk-reward ratio is an important risk management and trading  tool. It is important for beginning traders to take the extra time to  perform this task because it can help to minimize risk in every trade.   Waiting for the right risk-reward ratio can take a long time. However,  the benefits of waiting for a higher risk-reward ratio are worth the  effort and patience. You will know your risk and know your potential  profit. Most importantly, you will know whether the trade is worthy of  your money.

Risk/Reward Ratio

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg

What Does Risk/Reward Ratio Mean?

A ratio used by many investors  to compare the expected returns of an investment to the amount of risk  undertaken to capture these returns. This ratio is calculated  mathematically by dividing the amount of profit the trader expects to  have made when the position is closed (i.e. the reward) by the amount he  or she stands to lose if price moves in the unexpected direction (i.e.  the risk).

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg

Investopedia explains Risk/Reward Ratio

Let's  say a trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ Company at $20 and places a  stop-loss order at $15 to ensure that her losses will not exceed $500.  Let's also assume that this trader believes that the price of XYZ will  reach $30 in the next few months. In this case, the trader is willing to  risk $5 per share to make an expected return of $10 per share  after closing her position. Since the trader stands to make double the  amount that she has risked, she would be said to have a 2:1 risk/reward  ratio on that particular trade. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs  widely among trading strategies. Some trial and error is usually  required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy.

Reward-to-Risk Ratio

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...or/falling.png

Another way you can increase your chances of profitability is to  trade when you have the potential to make 3 times more than you are  risking. If you give yourself a 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio, you have a  significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run.  Take a look at this chart as an example:

10 Trades     Loss     Win           1     $1,000                 2           $3,000           3     $1,000                 4           $3,000           5     $1,000                 6           $3,000           7     $1,000                 8           $3,000           9     $1,000                 10           $3,000           Total     $5,000     $15,000

In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your  trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000. Just remember that  whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of  being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win  percentage.

BUT...
And this is a big one, like Jennifer Lopez's behind... setting large  reward-to-risk ratio comes at a price. On the very surface, the concept  of putting a high reward-to-risk ratio sounds good, but think about how  it applies in actual trade scenarios.

Let's say you are a scalper and you only wish to risk 3 pips. Using a  3:1 reward to risk ratio, this means you need to get 9 pips. Right off  the bat, the odds are against you because you have to pay the spread.
http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/d...&cb=59275ff7df

If your broker offered a 2 pip spread on EUR/USD, you'll have to gain 11  pips instead, forcing you to take a difficult 4:1 reward to risk ratio.  Considering the exchange rate of EUR/USD could move 3 pips up and down  within a few seconds, you would be stopped out faster than you can say  "Uncle!"  If you were to reduce your position size, then you could widen your  stop to maintain your desired reward/risk ratio. Now, if you increased  the pips you wanted to risk to 50, you would need to gain 153 pips. By  doing this, you are able to bring your reward-to-risk ratio somewhere  nearer to your desired 3:1. Not so bad anymore, right?

In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren't set in stone. They  must be adjusted depending on the time frame, market environment, and  your entry/exit points.  A position trade could have a reward-to-risk  ratio as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.

Risk/Reward Ratio in Forex - What Is the Proper Risk and Reward Ratio in Forex Trading?

By Vahid | Category: Forex Basics | Monday, September 28th, 2009

It is very easy to find hundreds of articles about risk/reward ratio in forex  trading, but the problem is that most of those  articles are not written  by real traders who trade for a living or  have been working as professional  traders for a while. Most of them are  written by freelance writers who are paid to write  articles or  bloggers and webmasters who want to drive some traffic to their  weblogs  and websites. Most of these writers have  never placed any order on the  market throughout their lives. The bigger  problem is that novice traders believe  each and every word of these  articles, just because they are published on the  internet, but they  don’t know that the directions that these articles give are  not  applicable in live trading. After reading these articles, novice traders  try  to apply them in their trades and after such a long time of trial  and error,  they will think that they are not able to follow the trading  rules and so they  give up, whereas it is the information and  directions of the articles that can  not be applied in live trading.

For example, on most of the articles you read about risk/reward  ratio, it is  strongly recommended that novice traders should not even  think about taking  positions with a risk/ratio of as high as 1:1 or  even 1:2 (I will explain what these numbers mean later in this article)  and the maximum risk/reward ratio  of the positions that new traders  take should be 1:3. There is nothing wrong  with it so far, but the  problem is that these articles never clarify if traders  should have a  low risk/reward ratio through having wide targets OR tight stop  losses.  As nobody likes to lose, specially new traders, they all think that  they  should make their stop loss as tight as possible to have a low  risk/reward ratio  trade, whereas this is a big mistake. No matter how  tight or wide the targets  are, a trader can not fool around with the  stop loss. Choosing the stop loss has  its own rules that can not be  ignored or broken. If you set your stop loss  tighter than what it has  to be, you will be stopped out easily even when your  position is  correct.

Something that looks even stranger in these articles is that they  emphasize  that “novice” traders should not take positions with 1:1 or  1:2 risk/reward  ratios. Does it mean that experienced traders can do  it? Are there different  trading rules and techniques for novice and  experienced traders? Maximizing the  profit and having 1:3 or 1:5 trades  can be done by professional and experienced  traders, but there are  some technical and emotional difficulties in front of  novice traders to  do that. For example, to achieve a successful 1:5 trade, you  may have  several losing trades (I will tell you why). This is not a problem for   professional traders at all, but for a novice trader who is learning the   techniques and has to build his/her confidence at the same time,  having losing  trades can cause lack of confidence and excessive fear  that prevent him/her from  advancing to the next steps.

So we can not believe and apply whatever we read over the internet.  There are  zillions of systems, techniques, indicators, robots and… that  are absolutely  useless when it comes to live and real trading.

After the above introduction, lets see what risk/reward ratio is and  why  it is important in forex trading. Risk is the amount of the money  that you may  lose in a trade. If you have already read the  money management  article, you know that we should not risk more than 2-3% of our   capital in each trade. It means when we find a trade setup and we find a   proper place for the stop loss,  we have to choose our position lot size in the way that if the market   hits our stop loss, we lose maximum 2-3% of our capital. For example we  have found a  trade setup with EUR-USD that has to have an 80 pips stop  loss. We have a $5000  account. If EUR-USD hits our stop loss, we should  lose $150 which is 3% of  our capital (0.03 x $5000 = $150). It means  80 pips equals $150 (you can use the position size  calculator I have on  the money management article). This $150 is our risk. But  what is the  reward? Reward is the profit that we can make in a trade. In the  above   example, if we choose a 160 pips target for our trade and EUR-USD hits  this  target, we will make $300 (when 80 pips equals $150, so 160 pips  equals $300). This $300  profit is the reward.

So what is the risk/reward ratio of this trade? 150:300 = 1:2

The larger the profit (target) against the loss (stop loss), the  smaller the  risk/reward ratio which means your risk is smaller than  your reward. For example  if your stop loss is 20 pips in a trade and  your target is 100 pips, your  risk/reward ratio will be 1:5 in this  trade.

What is the recommended risk/reward ratio in forex trading?

1:3 or 1:5 risk/reward ratio is achievable when the market forms a  trend and you  succeed to enter on time. In most cases you should be  able to hit the top and  bottom of the trends, no matter on what time  frame you trade. Or if you enter at  the middle of the way, the trend   should be strong enough to give you another big movement and make a  profit which is 3 or 5 times bigger  than your stop loss. You can do  that. Why not? But there are just a few problems:  1. Markets form a  trend in less than 30% of the cases; 2. Some trends are not  strong  enough that if you enter with delay and while they are at the middle of   the way, they can hit your target which is 3 or 5 times bigger than  your stop  loss. 3. There are many cases that you miss the trends; you  hesitate to enter  and so you miss the chance; you think you have found a  trend whereas you are wrong and it returns and hits your stop loss and…  . So you  lose in many trades, because you want to catch a big one.

So in reality, you have to lose in many trades, or have many of your  trades  closed at breakeven by the stop loss (because you will have to  move the stop  loss to breakeven when you are in a special amount of  profit), or not to trade for such a  long time waiting for a strong  trend, until you  can have a 1:3 or 1:5 trade.

How is it possible to catch a 1:3 or 1:5 trade  without losing so many other trades?

If you take a position with 1:3 or 1:5 stop loss to target ratio and  then you wait  for it to hit your stop loss or target, you will have so  many losing trades  before having a winning trade. The reasons are  mentioned above.

The solution is in moving the stop loss. You  should  not let your stop loss remain at its initial position. To have a 1:3   trade, the distance of your entry and your final target should be  splitted into  3 parts (at least), while each part is equal to your  original stop loss value. For example  if you have a 50 pips stop loss,  you should have a final target for 150 pips  which should be splitted  into three 50 pips levels. Then you should move your stop loss  in three  stages (in this example I assume that you take a 3% risk in each   trade):

1. If the price reaches to the first 1/3 level, you should move the  stop loss  to breakeven. At this stage, if the price goes against you  and hits the stop  loss, you will get out without any profit/loss, BUT  you should consider that you  had an initial risk of 3%.

2. If it reaches the 2/3 level, you should move the stop loss to 1/3  level.  At this stage, if the price goes against you and hits the stop  loss, you will  get out with a profit which equals your initial risk.  For example if your stop loss  has been 3% of your account, you will get  out with a 3% profit. Therefore, such  a trade will be ended as a 1:1  risk/reward trade.

3. If it becomes so close to the final target, you should move the  stop loss  to 2/3 level. Then you have to wait until it hits the final  target or returns  and hits the stop loss. At this stage, if it goes  against you and hits the stop  loss, you will get out with a profit  which is twice of your initial risk. For  example if your stop loss is  3% of your account, you will get out with a 6%  profit. Therefore, such a  trade will be ended as a 1:2 risk/reward trade. If the  price hits the  final target, your trade will be closed with a 9% profit and so  you  will have a 1:3 risk/reward trade.

So, to have a 1:3 trade, you will have some -3% trades which are  those trades  that hit the stop loss at its initial position. You will  also have some 0%  trades that are  those trades that hit the stop loss  at breakeven. Some of  your trades will be +3% trades which are those  that hit the stop loss at 1/3  level. Some will be +6% trades which are  those that hit the stop loss at 2/3  level. And finally, some trades  will be +9% trades which are those that trigger  the final target.

Now the question is what percent of your trades will be -3%, 0%, +3%, +6%  and 9% trades?

It is impossible to answer the above question, because it depends on  many  things including the trading strategy and market condition.  However, there is  something that gives us a clue about the number of  our 1:3 and 1:5 trades. It is  the fact that says market trends only in  30% of the cases and it makes ranging,  70% of the time. To have 1:3 and  1:5 trades, we should have a strong trend,  otherwise our stop loss  will be triggered in one of the stages before reaching  the final  target, no matter what time frame you use to take your position.

No need to remind again that in any of the -3%, 0%, +3%, +6% and 9%  trades  your risk is the same which is 3%. The first conclusion is that  taking the risk  and the position is up to you, BUT it is the market  that determines how your  trade should be ended. This is something that  all traders, specially novice ones  should consider. When you read in  different websites and web pages that your  trades should only be 1:3  and 1:5 trades, you should consider that you really  never know how many  of your trades will be ended as 1:3 and 1:5 trades.

That was about risk/reward ratio in general. Now lets become more specific  and talk about Forexoma trading signals, their risk/reward ratios and if it is possible  to have 1:3 or 1:5 trades with Forexoma signals or not.

The stop loss of the positions that I take are chosen based on the  technical  analysis rules that I have for myself. I will never break any  of these rules.  Some traders think that my stop losses are too wide,  but they are not. Unlike  some other traders who have a constant value  for their stop loss (for example  any position they take, with any  currency pair and any time frame, has a 120  pips stop loss), I mainly  follow the rule of thumb we have for setting the stop  loss. The rule  says that you should place your stop loss in a position that  becomes  triggered only when the direction you choose is completely wrong. So   when I want to set the stop loss, I ask myself under what condition the  position  I have taken is wrong. The answer I give to this question is  the position of the  stop loss. In one of the articles I published long  time ago, I have explained  about  setting the stop loss and target orders.

So my stop losses can not be tighter. What about the targets? Can they be  wider?

In the way that I choose the entries, most of our trades can have  bigger  targets and having 1:2 and 1:3 trades is possible with most of  the positions we  take, because our entry point is always well-chosen.  Of course it can be  different in different days, weeks and months. I  will tell you how to trade my  signals in the way that you can have 1:3  trades.

Now the question is if my signals can be used to have 1:3 and even  1:5  positions, why my targets are smaller than what they can be?

As you know in the typical signals that I send the members, usually  there are  two targets. The first target is usually half of the stop  loss size and the  second target is the same size as the stop loss.  Traders can close 50% of their  positions at the first target and then  move the stop loss to breakeven. Then  they can close the second 50% at  the second target. There is a second way too.  They can just move the  stop loss to breakeven when the price reaches the first  target and then  close the whole position at the second target. In the last  performance report I have published, I have explained 4 different ways that  members can trade the signals I send them.

To answer the above question that why my targets are small, I have to  say  that they are small because there are different traders with  different levels of  skill among the members. Advanced traders know how  to maximize their positions.  They just use my signals to enter. However  there are many other members who like  to take as many positions as  they can and they like to see them finished all  green and positive. As I  said above, they are building their confidence while  they are learning  the techniques. They need to see the positive result of the  things  they are learning. They are not disciplined and patient enough yet to   maximize their trades and it is so painful to them, if a position which  is in a  good profit, suddenly goes against them and hits the stop loss  at breakeven and  they get out without any profit. The tight targets I  have in the signals I send  the members, are for these members. Unlike  the others who believe novice traders  should start with 1:3 and 1:5  trades, I believe they should start with 1:1 and  even bigger  risk/reward ratios to build their confidence. When they become more   skilled, which can take them a few years at least, they can maximize  their  profits and have 1:3 and 1:5 positions. I am 100% sure that those  who say novice  traders should only take 1:3 and 1:5 positions, are not  real traders and know  nothing about live and even demo trading.  Unfortunately there are zillions of  them these days who develop forex  websites, weblogs and even robots and e-books.  Forex is just a market  for them to make money, not through forex trading, but  through selling  useless forex related products to “novice” traders. http://www.forexoma.com/wp-includes/.../icon_wink.gif

Anyway!

From now on, each signal comes with two sets of targets. In the first   set, the targets will be the same as they were used to be in the  signals I sent.  In the second set, the targets will be for a 1:3  risk/reward trade. The stop  loss will be the same in both sets, because  as I said I can not make the stop  losses tighter. It is up to the  members to choose the way they like to trade. We  will have enough  instructions in members area to help members to take their  positions  with any level of risk/reward ratio they like.

Should you have any question or suggestion, please use the below comment form.

Thanks for your time http://www.forexoma.com/wp-includes/...icon_smile.gif

Why the Risk-to-Reward Ratio is Overrated

By Walter Peters                    | TradingMarkets.com | May 26, 2010 08:31 AM

Sometimes axioms are repeated over and over, and that is enough  for many to accept them as fact. "No pain, no gain" - really? Would  every doctor agree with that? "If it sounds too good to be true, then it  probably is" - well, truthfully there are homes selling for $1 now, so  maybe that isn't true either.

In trading, one of my favorites is "you must aim to get more profit  than you risk on each trade." Sometimes this is stated in other ways,  such as:

"Always keep your reward to risk ratio greater than 1"

"Only take trades with a minimum of a 2:1 reward to risk ratio"

"If you aim for more than you risk, then you will make money."

"A good reward to risk ratio ensures you to be profitable, winning more than you lose."

Another way of stating this is that your reward to risk ratio must be  greater than 1, or 2, or any other number that your favorite trading  guru comes up with. Many traders have heard that it is desirable to have  a high reward to risk ratio, and it certainly makes it easier for a  trader to make money even if the trader has a low win percentage.  However, there are many profitable traders who always risk more than  they aim to secure in profits. The key to profitability for these  traders is that they keep a high win rate.

An example may best illustrate how the reward to risk ratio is calculated:

Trader Amber decides to buy the EUR/USD at 1.3100

Amber puts her stop loss at 1.3050, so her stop is 50 pips away from her entry.

Amber decides to enter a profit target of 1.3200, 100 pips away from her entry.

Thus, Amber is risking 50 pips to make 100 pips.

If we divide the possible gain by the possible loss, we get the reward to risk ratio.

100 pips profit / 50 pips risked = 2:1 reward to risk ratio

In other words, Amber has decided to keep her profit target further  from her entry price than her stop loss. This certainly is  understandable, but there are many other ways to make money trading.

Keeping a good reward to risk ratio may increase your average  win size and decrease your average loss size, but there are other  statistics that determine your overall profitability, as a trader.

The most important statistics are as follows:

Percentage of winning trades - W%.

Percentage of losing trades - L%.

Average gain on a winning trade - Ave W.

Average loss of a losing trade - Ave L.

Here's why these statistics are important - with just these four  statistics you can find out how good your trading system is, and thus  decide if it is worth it to trade the system with real money. With these  four statistics you can calculate expectancy of your trading system.

The formula is as follows:

Expectancy = (W% x Ave W) - (L% x Ave L)

The expectancy number tells you how much money you would expect to  win over many trades. The best way to get these statistics is to  backtest your trading strategy, or employ your trading strategy with a demo account. Do this for many, many trades (at least 50), and then plug in the numbers.

Let's look at a trader, Jeff, as an example:

Let's say that trader Jeff has a trading system that he backtests manually in a demo account for six months, with over 900 trades, and he gets the following statistics.

W% - 70%

L% - 30%

Ave W - $200

Ave L - $420

Calculating expectancy, Jeff sees that (0.7 x 200) - (0.3 x 420) =  $140 - $126 = $14.

So, armed with this information, trader Jeff knows  that if he takes 100 trades with his system, and the average winning  trade is $200, and the average losing trade is $420, with a 70% win rate  he is likely to have 70 winning trades, 30 losing trades and he will  probably make $1400.

How does Jeff know this? He knows this because he  knows that (70 x $200) - (30 x $420) = $14,000 - $12,600 = $1,400.

This doesn't mean trader Jeff will make $1,400. This only means that  we would expect him to make $1,400 over 100 trades. Of course Jeff's  real results could be a little better or a little worse, but they are  probably going to be very near $1,400 after 100 trades.

Many traders, including myself, have gotten into trouble by simply focusing on one part of the equation.

Traders who focus on win rate and forget about average loss size can get into trouble if their average loss gets too big.

This is the sort of problem that many scalpers run into. Scalpers  count on a high win rate. Without a high win rate most scalpers will  lose
money.  This is because nearly every scalper, by definition, will look to take  quick profits from the markets, however the scalper will often have a  stop loss that is placed further away than the profit target, and this  can spell trouble if the win percentage starts to slip. Some scalpers  avoid this problem by letting some positions run for a while if they are  exceptionally well-timed entries. This will dramatically increase the  scalper's average win and can really improve the odds of the scalper's  long term survival.

Traders who focus on average win size can get into trouble if they let their win rate get too low.

This problem is common with those traders who are focused on the  reward to risk ratio. Sometimes traders become "slave to the reward to  risk ratio." Profit targets should be placed where the market is likely  to go. Traders who focus too much on the reward to risk ratio can avoid  this problem by defining profit targets using sound market analysis, and  THEN calculating the reward to risk ratio.

There are many things to think about when backtesting your trading  system - the reward to risk ratio will tell only part of the story. If  you have a trading system that you think may work, backtest the  strategy, and then calculate the expectancy. You may find that that the  strategy makes money, even if the reward to risk ratio is not ideal.

Looks like "to win the mare or loose the halter".

EURNZD, Daily, 2010 November 29

Daily

Have put the EURNZD at my Watchlist and wait for a price action (engulfing pattern, or a hammer, or an in bar, or something like that) in combination with a CCI(14) bottom, before I could go in the market with some long investments.

There're a lot of indifferent candles around the important support line in the last two weeks.

Monthly

Monthly bar could go further down November, may be December Bar too, before a trend revearsal could come up. I don't know - may be as we shall see later.

Good trading at H1/H4 by waiting for the next breakout before trades at higher timeframes could be done.

Really funny.

EURJPY Daily seems to work out a pattern recognition where you have to count "one", "two" and at "two" you put out your order.

May be it could be better trading the Daily CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms Divergences.

I have been taking part in a trading contest run by a broker, its good for practice and there is a first prize of $5000, so it is worth taking part as normally people with demo accounts don't bother with money management or rules, they will leave trades open, not close losers etc.

Now you might wonder what this has to do with fxcube. Well trading with fear of no loss makes you a much better trader, even though you are taking part in a contest and you want to win, you don't care if a trade runs against you, provided you expected it. If I was trading for real money I would get edgy and want to close taking a loss.

Its the same with this system, losses occur when you close a trade, the variation between your entry and the market can be large, maybe 70 pips or so. Most traders use 20 pip stops and get chopped up.

In trading understanding the pair you trade is a requirement, types of moves, when does it start to move are all prime requirements if you really are a serious trader.

My advice to anyone is to trade in the bigger trend direction and use fxcubes system it looks great. To be honest I gave up using indicators a while back, my one real rule now is if the markets moving down sell it, if its moving up buy it.

I think this is a well thought out strategy, maybe one eye on the bigger trend would help turn it into a fantastic strategy.

All the best

Everybody needs to trade his own style and his own system, u can copy systems out of ff.com and otherwise but actually u should adapt it to ur liking.

In FXcubes sys there are a lot of false signals as well.... there is no perfect Indicator or System.

that's quiet responsible

Hi Mike Haran

If you mean the Contes by Alpari from November 05 - December 05 so I know it and also I take part there. There is a leverage only from 1:10, not more and that was interesting me. My target was 5-20% in a month. May account is now at 119'363.01 so there is a Profit: 19'363.01  since 2010 November 5 - not bad for an account with a leverag from 1:10. Below you can see the "contest orders".

I wish you success and Happiness!

Hi PhAnTi'

Time Cell Trading don't evoked more false signals than other trading systems here at FF-Board. You have to read Time Cell Trading System in a right way - so work out the Multiple Time Frame Analysis before you will choose the right time frame. I have given a lot of examples here on board how to do it and others will follow. What do you mean, when you talk about "a lot of false signals", please give a collection of examples here on board, then we can discuss all it here. I hate the generalizations like "a lot of". It pisses me off though! TCT is one of my 20 self-developed trading systems and I think TCT avoid many pitfalls!

Modes request:...and the rest is inherent in the system, so every system have it. What an information value has now your declaration in practice.

Show examples, please! Then we can discuss in detail and improving the performance.

Hi Mike Haran

short clarification

It's not fear or anxiety ..it's my sheer kind of trading for the simple reason that I will take up the baton for a time before the Stop Loss will throw out these orders out of the market, ....and  can hedge these positions several time, before the most of them will run  in a win. It's a kind of calculus, not a question of fear.

Hope you understand these conditions now better.

I too am in the contest, at the moment I am sitting with a good profit in the top 30, all I am doing is selling the trend. Like you I was always working with strategys and looking for a winning system.

I failed as a trader because I was trying to make someones system my own and that never works. We are all individual people, we think and act in different ways, I hate position trading because I can't stand the market comming back on a position, thats me so long term trading is out really as my head hates it. I would rather trade, take a profit, get in on a retrace again. Possibly not the best way to trade, maybe the best is enter a position and leave it alone adding as the market goes in your direction. That is the best way I know it. But I can't do it because I a not wired that way.

I love your system, I think it is intelligent and well thought out, there are not 100% winning systems 99% for sure if you want to have 1 trade wipe out 400, again its like building a house and having one day tear it down. Not for me but some people will be able to do it. At the moment I like to trade on a 78% winning to losing trade ratio, because I feel that I get rewarded when I am right. I close my trades when the market looks like it does not want to go lower, thats practice. Trading a empty chart is something I find very relaxing. Its you and price and nothing else.

Best of luck

AUDCAD, Monthly, 2010 November 30

CCI(14) at the Top. As a Long Line Trade seems to be a good argument for some enter short. May be wait at confirmation with Daily and H4 (both CCIs are now down and not at its tops, see #994, please). I take the risk just now with some positions and added some others enter short by a higher market price .

Weekly (no chart here) could go further down till the middle line of BB, may be then a retrace before crossing it further downwards. We don't know! Let's see.

Hi mrhb30jr

The Euro could even so make a down till ~ 1.1650 if big captial could select the Euro for pure speculation (see #978 , please). Euro can go up and down and up and down, so it has reached an uncontrolled status up to date, where erratic movements could breakout anytime and fast and this could join in some misinterpretation. My be take some trades at M1/M5/M15. May be we could see a strong move over 1'000 pips at one day, if speculation power will come to more force.

My two cents (worth),...the Euro isn't 0.9 worth, so do the Dollar.

You're wellcome!

I like more to stay at the sideline with the trading at the higher timeframes dead on time. So I trade predominantly more shorter timeframes. This seems for me an important statement, due to the fact that there will be at all trading systems market conditions where the trading system seems to be a little out of order. If you trade the Time Cell Trading (TCT) with Multiple Time Frame Analysis (MTFA) and the conlusion is comprised of say "a few pro arguments" and "a few contra arguments" then it might be better to wait for serene weather and wait at the sideline with your open umbrella.

The film, initially scheduled for an August 2005 release date, was postponed, partly so it could premiere at the Venice Film Festival, partly – some speculate – so that it could be better prepared for Academy Award nomination.

The film opened in the United Kingdom on March 24, 2006, the Netherlands on March 30, 2006, and the rest of Europe in April 2006. United Artists  had been scheduled to distribute the film in the United States, but  when the film finally got a limited release on September 7, 2007,  director Turturro decided to distribute the film himself. United Artists  remains a partial rights holder to the film, but Icon International, actor Mel Gibson's company, now has full distribution rights in the U.S.[1] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is distributing the film outside the U.S. and Sony Pictures (under license from Icon International, and ironically a cousin company to UA) released the DVD on February 12, 2008.

User Reviews                 weird but strangely wonderful

27 March 2006 | by adamk-2 (London, England)

"Romance & Cigarettes" is a flawed but endearing film. Its stylised dialogue -- often stitched together from song lyrics, lines from films and, I think, even a snatch of Beckett's Endgame -- its characters bursting into lip-synched song and dance, its strange, disjointed scenes and its total lack of romance will doubtless annoy a lot of people hoping for something somewhat more straightforward and conventional. Personally, I was hoping for something that might address the issues of love, romance and relationships which the film, instead, prodded gently before dancing and singing around them. I would also have liked to have seen more of Mary Louise Parker, who I thought was cruelly underused. And...Eddie Izzard? And yet...and yet...I really liked this film. It had an inventiveness and a quirky charm, a surreal, loopy approach to narrative and dialogue, was beautifully filmed and -- within limitations of the form -- wonderfully acted. Particular kudos to Kate Winslet, unrecognizably and thoroughly dislikeable, who nonetheless "sings" one of the more heart-stopping numbers, Ute Lemper's version of Cave & Piseks "Little Water Song", while underwater. Meanwhile, adding to his gallery of whacked-out and weird characters, Christopher Walken delivers what must be one of his weirdest performances yet as the Elvis-idolising Cousin Bo. Like a lot of things in this film, you have to see it to believe it, and even then you won't be too sure.

I see cultdom beckoning for this little gem, late-night showings, repeated viewings, singalongs and favourite lines of dialogue bandied about like a secret currency. It's unlikely that it would have been made if it wasn't John Turturro writing and the Coens producing, but now it's out there, I recommend it be seen, if only for curiosity value. You either hate it or love it and -- for all its flaws -- I loved it.

Daily and H4 could go further down If so then I will take the risk over and will buy again some Enter Longs.

"ttc-combination"

CCI(14) H1 is showing a bottom and so I take the risk over with an Enter Long meanwhile with EURUSD an Enter Short are running at one and the same time (to the contrary "ttc"). In short time (H1/H4) one currency pair should run in a win and the other then is holding a while longer and could terminate at a higher timeframe (Daily/Weekly).

See also #1018, #1019 and #979, please.

This is an trading example, where you can wait patiently at M1/M5 and go in the market when you have finalize a decision to enter in only for short moments. Go in and go out quickly and then let the market go by itself. Take your wins out. That's all. Market will offer opportunities all the time.

If you trade with higher lotsizes you can go in and go out of the market like the clappers. There is no need to hold the trade any longer, see EURUSD, M1 and M5 examples below (Profit 1'290.- $), please, e.g. by trade the upper and lower lines of BB.

Be careful and contemplate the "High Lot Trading" (HLT) only with your wins, when your account is in credit and you've reached an advanced trading style level!

Hi Forexcube,

Can you please explain your trading system for M1/M5 ? do you wait M5 to hit upper or lower line of Bollinger Band ? and enter on M1 ?

Thanks a lot ...

Regards,

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Hello pipfirst

So you can do. Sometimes I look at the MurreyMath Lines or at the pivotal points and when market prices are there I set the market entries in the opposite direction. Often when Market are in a sideway movement I'm oriented towards the upper and lower line of Bollinger Band at M1 or M5 depending to the volatility of the market. Yes!

The EMA Lines (at higher timeframes) could be a great help as support or resistance line then again!

You could also take a look at M15/M30 and if there is a strong trend then set M1 or M5 with the trend.

M1/M5 trading isn't possible trading into profit whole the day. You have well to analyse the market before and wait, if need be... for hours.

May be I will make some records in the following weeks about "M1/M5 trading" and post this here on board.

The Daily Pivots could be helpful reference points where the daily market could go up to. So you can trade the M1 often on the way.

Hope it helps!

Kindest regards

USDCAD, H4, 2010 December 03

Enter long at CCI(14) bottom ~ 1.0045 currently.

Daily (CCI 14 bottom, too) and weekly (pos. divergence) seems provide evidence.

If monthly support (see  #1035, please) from the last four bars and the 2004.10.01 don't hold repetitive downside movement till the murrey math overshoot level [-1/8] at 0.9277 seems equally probable.

Hi Verb

Thank you for your bland words.

It depends of the volatility and the timeframe. By Daily and Weekly often I take one of the pivotal points or the murrey math or I switch at lower timeframes and look if there are any supports or resistance or et vice versa by looking at higher timeframes. Sometimes I go with 4 or 5 trades in the market and take 1 or 2 out of the market after several pips and then I let a part of the rest running further on, wait half of a day or one or two days and look where prices are then. Last one is the breath of the market which I try to collect. Moreover I draw the CCI(14) line in the counterpart direction ever so often and have to point out where the future price could go forth. Also I look if money is enough and go out with a win freelance of the total.

Hope it helps!

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
It's what I figured, I just had noticed that you entered the price into some of the trades and wondered how there were derived.

Also I would not that if you adjusted your CCI and RSI to 70 periods that would be the equivalent of seeing M5 on your M1 chart.

Hi, Forexcube,

A very interesting thread! . I have a quick question, having a look at your today's trades in myfxbook.com , I see there are quite a lot of losing positions, do those positions are part of your overall strategy ?

Hi again, Forexcube

So sorry, didn' t want to sound rude, is just a question, as I' ve been reading your posts about quick trades, and the open positions that appear are long term ones, I was curious about them being on a different timeframe election, or simply losing positions waiting to be closed.

MQL4-Course

Coder's Guru Full Course —  by Coder's Guru — a full course on MQL development (programming for  MetaTrader 4) that will help you develop your own custom indicators,  trading scripts and automated expert advisors.

Home » Mql - Metatrader Development Course
Welcome to MQL4 course!

Welcome to the MQL4 course.

In this series, I  will try to strip the mystique and confusion from MQL4 by giving you  comprehensive tutorials with a straight forward example.

In this  series of lessons, I will show you how to use the MQL4 for building  your own Expert Advisors, Custom Indicators and Scripts.
http://www.metatrader.info/system/fi...atformlogo.gif

If  you are programming in C (or its superset C++) then you know a lot of  MQL4 before even I start my lessons, if you didn’t write in any  programming language before, no problem, I’ll guide you to understand  the concept of programming in general as well.

So, let’s start from the beginning.
MQL4? What, Why and Where?

MQL4 stands for MetaQuotes Language 4.

MetaQuotes is the company who built the MetaTrader Trading Platform.

And  to make it stronger than the other trading platforms the company  extended it by a built-in programming language that enables the user  (you) to write his own trading strategies.

The language enables you to create one of the following:

1- Expert Advisors.

2- Custom Indicators.

3- Scripts.

• Expert Advisor  is a program which can automate trading deals for you. For example it  can automate your market orders, stops orders automatically,  cancels/replaces orders and takes your profit.

• Custom Indicator is a program which enables you to use the functions of the technical indicators and it cannot automate your deals.

• Script  is a program designed for single function execution. Unlike the  Advisor, scripts are being held only once (on demand), and not by ticks.  And of course has no access to indicator functions.

These were “What” MQL4 is? “Why” to use MQL4?

Now, “Where” do I write MQL4?

To write your MQL4 code and as anything else in world, you can choose one of two ways, the hard way and the easy way.
1- The hard way:

The hard way is using your favorite text editor and the command prompt to compile your program.

Notepad is not bad choice, but do not forget two things:

1- To save the file you have created in plain text format.

2- To save the file as .mp4 (that’s to be easy to reopen it with MetaEditor), but you can save it as any extension you prefer.

After saving your program there is an extra step to make your code comes out to the light.

It’s the Compiling step.

Compiling  means to convert the human readable script that you have just wrote to  the machine language that your computer understands.

MetaTrader has been shipped with its own compiler (the program which will convert your script to the machine language) called MetaLang.exe.

Metalang.exe is a console program which takes two parameters and output an .ex4 file (the file which Metatrader understands).

The first parameter is “options” parameter and the only option available is –q quit

The second parameter is the full path to your .mql file.

The syntax will be in this format.

metalang [options…] filename
Example:

1- Find your metalang.exe path, it will be the same path of MetaTrader (here my path is Drogram FilesMetaTrader 4).

2- Create a batch file and name it compile.bat (or any name you prefer).

3- Write these lines into the bat file then save it:
cd Drogram FilesMetaTrader 4

metalang -q "Drogram FilesMetaTrader 4my_first_mql4_script.mq4"
(Don’t forget to change the path to you MetaTrader installed path).

4- Run the batch file and if you are lucky person like me you will get a screen like figure 1.
http://www.metatrader.info/system/fi...on1_image1.jpg
Figure 1 Metalang compiler As you see you will get the output file “my_first_mql4_script.ex4”
2-The easy way:

Metatrader has been shipped with a good IDE (integrated development editor) called MetaEditor which has these features:

1- A text editor has the feature of highlighting different constructions of MQL4 language while you are writing/reading code.

2- Easy  to compile your program, just click F5 and the MetaEditor will make all  the hard work for you and produces the “ex4” file.

Besides it’s easy to see what the wrong in your program is (in the Error Tab – see figure 2).

3- Built-in a dictionary book which you can access by highlight the keyword you want to know further about it then press F1.

Figure 2 MetaEditor 4  In the coming lessons we will know more about MetaEditor.

Today I just came to say hello, tomorrow we will start the real works and will study the Syntax of MQL4.
I welcome very much the questions and the suggestions.
See you

CCI-L5-TCT Indicator (with 5 Levels: -200, -100, 0, +100, +200)

By means of this CCI(14) indicator, you can't switch the periods of the   schedule in the MetaTrader. You'll have all the periods in one's sight.

Example: EURNZD, H1, 2010 December 05

Self-explanatory!

Trade the CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms

Do the Right Thing CCI Trade

Without  resorting to the mathematics of the indicator, please note that CCI is  an unbounded oscillator with any reading of +100* typically considered to  be overbought and any reading of  -100*  oversold. For our purposes, however, we will use these levels as our  trigger points as we put a twist on the traditional interpretation of  CCI. We actually look to buy if the currency pair makes a new high above  100* and sell if the currency pair makes a new low below -100*. In  “do  the right thing” we are looking for new peaks or spikes in momentum that  are likely to carry the currency pair higher or lower. The thesis  behind this setup is that much like a body hurtled in motion will remain  so until it’s slowed by counterforces, new highs or lows in CCI will  propel the currency further in the direction of the move before new prices finally put a halt to the advance or the decline.

Rules for the Long Trade
1. On the daily, H4 or the hourly charts place the CCI indicator with standard input of -100/-150/-200.
2. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of greater than +100* before dropping back below the +100* zone.
3. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.
4.  If CCI once again trades above the +100* (z) and if its value exceeds the  prior peak (a) reading (z > a), go long at market at the close of the candle.*
...or if its value (z) fall below the prior peak (a) (z < a; a > z) then trade the negative divergence with one more entry sell order down [switches between the timeframes and look in what way is the difference from each others (trending or sideways market)] .
5. Measure the low of the candle and use it as your stop.
6. If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original stop, sell half and move stop to breakeven.
7. Take profit on the rest of the trade when position moves to two times your stop.

Rules for the Short Trade
1. On the daily, H4 or the hourly charts place the CCI indicator with standard input of +100/+150/+200.
2. Note the very last time the CCI registered a reading of less than -100* before poking above the -100* zone.
3. Take a measure of the peak CCI reading and record it.
4.  If CCI once again trades below the -100* (z) and if its value exceeds the  prior low (a) reading (z > a), go short at market at the close of the candle,*
...or if its value (z) undercut the prior (a) low (z < a; a > z), then trade the positive divergence with one more entry buy order up [switches  between the timeframes and look in what way is the difference from each  others (trending or sideways market)].
5. Measure the high of the candle and use it as your stop.
6.  If the position moves in your favor by the amount of your original  stop, sell half and move the stop on the remainder of the position to  breakeven.
7. Take profit on the rest of the trade when position moves to two times your stop.

Annotation:

*At shorter time frames (M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4) use +150 and/or +200 and -150 and/or -200 Level and at higher timeframes (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) use the +100 and -100 Line.

*Not in the sideway market, only at higher-time-frames-trending-market. (See chart below, please).

A Pending order is an instruction to open a position when the current price reaches the order level.

There are four types of pending orders: Buy Stop - an order to open a Buy position at a price higher than the price at the moment of placing the order. Sell Stop - an order to open a Sell position at a price lower than the price at the moment of placing the order. Buy Limit - an order to open a Buy position at a lower price than the price at the moment of placing the order. Sell Limit - an order to open a Sell position at a price higher than the price at the moment of placing the order.  http://www.alpari.co.uk/files/site_u...be45ce030a.gif

6 Steps To A Rule-Based Forex Trading System

by Selwyn Gishen (Contact Author | Biography)

A trading system is more than just having a rule or set of rules for  when to enter and when to exit a trade. It is a comprehensive strategy  that takes into account six very important factors, not the least of  which is your own personality. In this article, we will cover the  general approach to creating a rule-based trading system. (To learn  more, check out our Trading Systems Tutorial.)

Step 1: Examine Your Mindset
(A) Know who you are:  When trading the markets, your first priority is to take a look at  yourself and note your own personality traits. Examine your strengths  and your weaknesses, then ask yourself how you might react if you  perceive an opportunity or how you might react if your position is  threatened. This is also known as a personal SWOT analysis.  But do not lie to yourself. If you are not sure how you would act, ask  the opinion of someone who knows you well. (To learn more, see Does Your Personality Match Your Trading Methods?) (B) Match your personality to your trading: Be sure that you  are comfortable with the type of trading conditions you will experience  in different time frames. For example, if you have determined that you  are not the kind of person who likes to go to sleep with open positions  in a market that is trading while you sleep, perhaps you should consider  day trading  so that you can close out your positions before you go home. However,  you must then be the kind of person who likes the adrenalin rush of  constantly watching the computer throughout the day. Do you enjoy being  computer-bound? Are you an addictive or compulsive person? Will you  drive yourself crazy watching your positions and become afraid to go to  the bathroom in case you miss a tick? If you are not sure, go back and  re-audit your personality to be certain. Unless your trading style  matches your personality, you will not enjoy what you are doing and you  will quickly lose your passion for trading. (For more, see Day Trading: An Introduction.)

(C) Be prepared: Plan your trade so you can trade your plan.  Preparation is the mental dry run of your potential trades - a kind of  dress rehearsal. By planning your trade in advance, you are setting the  ground rules, as well as your limits. If you know what you are looking  for and how you plan to act if the market does what you anticipate, you  will be able to be objective and stand aside from the fear/greed cycle.

(D) Be objective: Do not become emotionally involved in your trade. It does not matter whether you are wrong or right. What matters, as George Soros  says, is that “you make more money when you are right than what you  lose when you are wrong.” Trading is not about ego, although for most of  us it can be disconcerting when we plan a trade, apply our entire  logical prowess and then find out that the market does not agree. It is a  matter of training yourself to accept that not every trade can be a  winning trade, and that you must accept small losses gracefully and move  on to the next trade.

(E) Be disciplined: This means that you have to know when to  buy and sell. Base your decisions on your pre-planned strategy and  stick to it. Sometimes you will cut out of a position only to find that  it turns around and would have been profitable had you held on to it.  But this is the basis of a very bad habit. Don’t ignore your stop losses  -  you can always get back into a position. You will find it more  reassuring to cut out and accept a small loss than to start wishing that  your large loss will be recouped when the market rebounds. This would  more resemble trading your ego than trading the market.

(F) Be patient: When it comes to trading, patience truly is a  virtue. Learn to sit on your hands until the market gets to the point  where you have drawn your line in the sand. If it does not get to your  entry point, what have you lost? There is always going to be an  opportunity to make gains another day. (For tips on patient investing,  read Patience Is A Trader’s Virtue.)

(G) Have realistic expectations:  This means that you won’t lose your focus on reality and miraculously  expect to turn $1,000 into $1 million 10 trades. What is a realistic  expectation? Consider what some of the best fund  managers in the world are capable of achieving - perhaps anywhere from  20-50% per annum. Most of them achieve much less than that and are  well-paid to do so. Go into trading expecting a realistic rate of return  on a consistent basis; if you manage to achieve a growth rate of 20% or  better every year, you will be able to outperform many of the  professional fund managers. (For more, see Gauge Portfolio Performance By Measuring Returns.)

Step 2: Identify Your Mission and Set Your Goals
(A)  With anything in life, if you don’t know where you are going, any road  will take you there. In terms of investing, this means you must sit down  with your calculator and determine what kind of returns you need to  reach your financial goals.

(B) Next, you must start to understand how much you need to earn in a  trade and how often you will have to trade to achieve your goals. Don’t  forget to factor in losing trades. This can bring you to the  realization that your trading methodology may be in conflict with your  goals. Therefore, it is critical to align your methodology with your  goals. If you are trading in standard 100,000 lots, your average value  of a pip is  around $10. So how many pips can you expect to earn per trade? Take your  last 20 trades and add up the winners and losers and then determine  your profits. Use this to forecast the returns on your current  methodology. Once you know this information, you can figure out if you  can achieve your goals and whether or not you are being realistic. (To  learn more, see How Does Leverage Affect Pip Value?)

Step 3: Ensure You Have Enough Money
(A) Cash  is the fuel needed to start trading and without enough cash, your  trading will be hampered by a lack of liquidity. But more important,  cash is a cushion against losing trades. Without a cushion, you will not  be able to withstand a temporary drawdown or be able to give your  position enough breathing space while the market moves back and forth  with new trends.

(B) Cash cannot come from sources that you need for other important events in your life, such as your savings plan for your children’s college education. Cash in trading accounts is “risk” money. Also known as risk capital,  this money is an amount that you can afford to lose without affecting  your lifestyle. Consider trading money as you would vacation savings.  You know that when the vacation is over the money will be spent and you  are OK with that. Trading carries a high degree of risk. Treating your trading capital as vacation money does not mean that you are not serious about protecting your capital,  rather it means freeing yourself psychologically from the fear of  losing so that you can actually make the trades that will be necessary  to grow your capital. Again, perform a personal SWOT analysis to be sure the necessary trading positions aren’t contrasting with your personality profile.

Step 4: Select a Market That Trades Harmoniously
(A) Pick a currency pair  and test it over different time frames. Start with the weekly charts,  then proceed to daily, four-hour, two-hour, one-hour, 30-minute,  10-minute and five-minute charts. Try to determine whether the market  turns at strategic points most of the time, such as at Fibonacci levels, trendlines or moving averages. This will give you a feeling of how the currency trades in the different time frames.

(B) Set up support and resistance levels in different time frames to  see if any of these levels cluster together. For example, the price at  127 Fibonacci extension on the weekly time frame may also be the price  at a 1.618 extension off of a daily time frame. Such a cluster would add  conviction to the support or resistance at that price point. (To learn  more, see Advanced Fibonacci Applications.)

Repeat this exercise with different currencies until you find the  currency pair that you feel is the most predictable for your  methodology.

(C) Remember, passion is key to trading. The repeated testing of your  set-ups requires that you love what you are doing. With enough passion  you will learn to accurately gauge the market.

(D) Once you have a currency pair that you feel comfortable with,  start reading the news and the comments regarding the particular pair  you have selected. Try to determine if the fundamentals are supporting  what you believe the chart is telling you. For example, if gold is going  up, that would probably be good for the Australian dollar, since gold  is a commodity that is generally positively correlated to the Australian  dollar. If you think gold is going to go down, then wait for the  appropriate time on the chart to short the Aussie. Look for a line of resistance to be the appropriate line in the sand to get timing confirmation before you make the trade.

Step 5: Test Your Methodology for Positive Results
(A)  This step is probably what most traders really think of as the most  important part of trading: A system that enters and exits trades that  are only profitable. No losses - ever. Such a system, if there were one,  would make a trader rich beyond his wildest dreams. But the truth is,  there is no such system. There are good methodologies and better ones  and even very average methods that can all be used to make money. The  performance of a trading system is more about the trader than it is  about the system. A good driver can get to his destination in virtually  any vehicle, but an untrained driver will probably not make it, no  matter how great fast the car is. (Sometimes the best system is a  mixture of methods. To learn more, read Blending Technical And Fundamental Analysis.)

(B) Having said the above, it is necessary to pick a methodology and  implement it many times in different time frames and markets to measure  its success rate. Often a system is a successful predictor of the market  direction only 55-60% of the time, but with proper risk management, the trader can still make a lot of money employing such a system.

(C) Personally, I like to use a system that has the highest reward to  risk, which means that I tend to look for turning points at support and  resistance levels because these are the points where it is easiest to  identify and quantify the risk. Support is not always strong enough to  stop a falling market, nor is resistance always strong enough to turn  back an advance in prices. However, a system can be built around the  concept of support and resistance to give a trader the edge required to  be profitable.

(D) Once you have designed your system, it is important to measure  its expectancy or reliability in various conditions and time frames. If  it has a positive expectancy (it produces more profitable trades than  losing trades) it can be used as a means to time entry and exit in the  markets.

Step 6: Measure Your Risk-to-Reward Ratios and Set Your Limits
(A)  The first line in the sand to draw is where you would exit your  position if the market goes against you. This is where you will place  your stop loss.

(B) Calculate the number of pips your stop is away from your entry point.  If the stop is 20 pips away from the entry point and you are trading a  standard lot, then each pip is worth approximately $10 (if the U.S.  dollar is your quote currency). Use a pip calculator if you are trading in cross currencies to make it easy to get the value of a pip.

(C) Calculate the percentage your stop loss would be as a percentage  of your trading capital. For example, if you have $1,000 in your trading  account, 2% would be $20. Be sure your stop loss is not more than $20  away from your entry point. If 20 pips are equal to $200, then you are  too leveraged for your available trading capital. To overcome this, you  must reduce your trading size from a standard lot to a mini-lot.  One pip in a mini-lot is equal to approximately $1. Therefore, to  maintain your 2% risk-to-capital, the maximum loss should be $20, which  requires that you trade only one mini-lot. (For more on minis, see Forex Minis Shrink Risk Exposure.)

(D) Now draw a line on your chart where you would want to take  profit. Be sure this is at least 40 pips away from your entry point.  This will give you a 2:1 profit-to-loss ratio. Since you cannot know for  sure if the market will reach this point, be sure to slide your stop to  breakeven as soon as the market moves beyond your entry point. At  worst, you will scratch your trade and your full capital will be intact.

(E) If you get knocked out on your first attempt, don’t despair.  Often it is your second entry that will be correct. It is true that “the  second mouse gets the cheese.” Often the market will bounce off your  support if you are buying, or retreat from your resistance if you are  selling, and you will enter the trade to test that level to see if the  market will trade back to your support or resistance. You can then catch  profits the second time around.

Summary

By fusing psychology, fundamentals, a  trading methodology and risk management, you’ll have the tools to select  an appropriate currency pair. All that is left to do is repeatedly  practice trading until the strategy is ingrained in your psyche. With  enough passion and determination, you will become a successful trader.

How does leverage work in the forex market?

The concept of leverage is  used by both investors and companies. Investors use leverage to  significantly increase the returns that can be provided on an  investment. They lever their investments by using various instruments that include options, futures and margin accounts.  Companies can use leverage to finance their assets. In other words,  instead of issuing stock to raise capital, companies can use debt  financing to invest in business operations in an attempt to increase shareholder value. (For more insight, see What do people mean when they say that debt is a relatively cheaper form of finance than equity?)

In forex, investors use leverage to profit from the fluctuations in exchange rates  between two different countries. The leverage that is achievable in  the forex market is one of the highest that investors can obtain.  Leverage is a loan that is provided to an investor  by the broker that is handling his or her forex account. When an  investor decides to invest in the forex market, he or she must first  open up a margin account with a broker. Usually, the amount of leverage  provided is either 50:1, 100:1 or 200:1, depending on the broker and the  size of the position the investor is trading. Standard trading is done  on 100,000 units of currency, so for a trade of this size, the leverage  provided is usually 50:1 or 100:1. Leverage of 200:1 is usually used for  positions of $50,000 or less.

To trade $100,000 of currency,  with a margin of 1%, an investor will only have to deposit $1,000 into  his or her margin account. The leverage provided on a trade like this is  100:1. Leverage of this size is significantly larger than the 2:1  leverage commonly provided on equities and the 15:1 leverage provided by  the futures market. Although 100:1 leverage may seem extremely risky,  the risk is significantly less when you consider that currency prices usually change by less than 1% during intraday trading. If currencies fluctuated as much as equities, brokers would not be able to provide as much leverage.

Although  the ability to earn significant profits by using leverage is  substantial, leverage can also work against investors. For example, if  the currency underlying one of your trades moves in the opposite  direction of what you believed would happen, leverage will greatly  amplify the potential losses. To avoid such a catastrophe, forex traders  usually implement a strict trading style that includes the use of stop and limit orders.

Application Programming Interface - API

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpgWhat Does Application Programming Interface - API Mean?

An  interface or "go-between" that enables a software program to interact  with other software. In the context of forex trading, an API refers to  the interface or platform that enables your platform to connect with the  market. APIs have multiple features that facilitate information  sharing, including real-time forex price quotations, trade execution and  order and trade confirmations.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpgInvestopedia explains Application Programming Interface - API

Proprietary  APIs are offered by almost every major online forex brokerage. Because  the fast-paced nature of forex trading makes automated trading  preferable to manual trading for most traders, a reliable API is an  important differentiator for a forex brokerage to ensure stable  operation and execution of trades.

Daily Report: RBA on Hold, BoC Next

FX markets are generally steady in range for the moment. No  new decision was made in the meeting of EU finance ministers overnight.  There were detailed discussion with IMF chief Strauss-Kahn and it's  believed that IMF has pushed for an increase in the EUR 750b crisis fund  but got no support from the Eurogroup. Also, there was no decision on  immediate bailout of Portugal and Spain.  Focus will turn to Irish  Parliament vote on the  2011 budget which is expected to include EUR 6b  savings. The first tranche of the EUR 85b bailout fund will be triggered  once the budget is approved. However, the majority os the leading party  is thin and the consequence of failing to pass the budget could be  disastrous to Ireland and spread contagion to other Eurozone countries.

Mid-Day Report: Dollar Lower on Risk Appetite; BoC on Hold

Dollar recovery was brief and is back under pressure today.  There are lots of news today, including US president Obama's  announcement to extend tax breaks, as well as talk of China rate hike  around the weekend. But these news have little impact in the markets.  Instead, solid risk appetite is driving the greenback down. In  particular, gold's up trend resumes today and makes another record high  near to 1430 level. Crude oil also manages to break through 90  psychological level. Strongest strength is seen in Aussie which extends  this week's rally against dollar and is trading above 0.995. Sterling is  also higher, together with Euro, on optimism of austerity budget  approval in Ireland.

EURUSD, Daily, 2010 December 09

Look at this strong daily resistance line, please - and the market price is moving down always below the middle line of BB - and then you can switch at H4 or more smaller.

So look at H4 chart and trade the resistance line (always down) with setting a stop loss above.

I wish you success and happiness!

EURUS, H1, 2010 December 09

Here you could see a great example, where a powerful market movement at H4 and Daily could lever out the rules of smaller time frames.

Normally you trade at point A1 at H1 up, but due to the fact that the bigger timeframes are showinfg a down, H1 arguments couldn't be further powerful. So concentrate at H1 if the market price will pierce through the support line. The green Hammer say okay we could go up (pro), but the ADX(14) > 25 (not on the chart) is signing a stronger downward trend (contra). So you have some pro and some contra and what I would make is trading only smaller time frames (M1/M5) till the market environment will getting more clearer. I think EURUSD is out of control and has actual reached an "extremely strong speculative currency pair" so heavy ups and downs could be always expected.

EURUSD

Monthly (#1109)  is showing a trend channel and the Weekly (#1109) are struggling around the middle line of Bollinger Band (BB). Daily (  #1110 ) has pointed out an indifferent candle whereas H4 (  #1110 ) is famous for one of these positive divergence again here (but tomorrow is the "crazy friday" again) and M30 ( #1111) are showing indifferent candles with some little ups and downs, so it's better to go on holiday or trade a little at M1/M5 the Pivotal Points.

I prefere to stay at the sideline and wait. May be some M1/M5 here and there.

For me I won't trade tomorrow, may be just a little. I'll take the opportunity to analyse variant types of currency pairs (Major Currency Pairs, Major Cross-Currency Pairs and Minor Currency Pairs, may be some Exotivc Pairs) - if there could work out some pattern detection.

Very helpful, thank you. I am going through all the relevant links on page # 1 and so all explanations on how you combine higher and lower timeframes to analyze the market is very informative.

I have signed up at your blog, is this going to be a signal site or ( preferably ) an educational/information site ?

I wrongly seemed to have thought that CCI is only good on 3min or 5min like Woodie traded the indices....

My be also good for some trades earlier at H1/H4 before the big market move could coming (may be this month or the following one?,..tomorrow?, ...we don't know!).

If the pound will be coming back (say by a definitely cross at the weekly upper line of BB around 2.2175) this currency pair could develop a strong power for a real long uptrending process.

Before there could be good trading aspects at H1/H4.

Trading Spot FX is Decentralized

Unlike in trading stocks or futures, you don't need to go through a  centralized exchange like the New York Stock Exchange with just one  price. In the forex market, there is no single price that for a given  currency at any time, which means quotes from different currency dealers  vary.

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...zed-market.png

"So many choices! Awesome!"

This might be overwhelming at first, but this is what makes the forex  market so freakin' awesome! The market is so huge and the competition  between dealers is so fierce that you get the best deal almost every  single time. And tell me, who does not want that?

Also, one cool thing about forex trading is that you can do it anywhere.

The FX Ladder

Even though the forex market is decentralized, it isn't pure and  utter chaos! The participants in the FX market can be organized into a  ladder. To better understand what we mean, here is a neat illustration:
http://www.babypips.com/school/image.../fx-ladder.png

At the very top of the forex market ladder is the interbank market.  Composed of the largest banks of the world and some smaller banks, the  participants of this market trade directly with each other or  electronically through the Electronic Brokering Services (EBS) or the  Reuters Dealing 3000-Spot Matching.

The competition between the two companies - the EBS and the Reuters  Dealing 3000-Spot Matching - is similar to Coke and Pepsi. They are in  constant battle for clients and continually try to one-up each other for  market share. While both companies offer most currency pairs, some  currency pairs are more liquid on one than the other.

For the EBS plaform, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, and USD/CHF  are more liquid. Meanwhile, for the Reuters platform, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP,  USD/CAD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD are more liquid.

All the banks that are part of the interbank market can see the rates  that each other is offering, but this doesn't necessarily mean that  anyone can make deals at those prices.

Like in real life, the rates will largely dependent on the established CREDIT  relationship between the trading parties. Just to name a few, there's  the "B.F.F. rate," the "customer rate," and the  "ex-wife-you-took-everything rate."  It's like asking for a loan at your  local bank. The better your credit standing and reputation with them,  the better the interest rates and the larger loan you can avail.

Next on the ladder are the hedge funds, corporations, retail market  makers and retail ECNs. Since these institutions do not have tight  credit relationships with the participants of the interbank market, they  have to do their transactions via commercial banks. This means that  their rates are slightly higher and more expensive than those who are  part of the interbank market.

At the very bottom of the ladder are the retail traders. It used to  be very hard for us little people to engage in the forex market but,  thanks to the advent of the internet, electronic trading, and retail  brokers, the difficult barriers to entry in forex trading have all been  taken down.

This gave us the chance to play with those high up the  ladder and poke them with a very long and cheap stick.

The Speculators

"In it to win it!"

This is probably the mantra of the speculators. Comprising close to  90% of all trading volume, speculators come in all shapes and sizes.  Some have fat pockets, some roll thin, but all of them engage in the  forex simply to make bucket loads of cash.

Don't worry... Once you graduate from the School of Pipsology, you can be part of this cool crowd!

Market Hours

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...hool/clock.png  Before looking at the best times to trade, we must look at what a 24 hour day in the forex world looks like.

The forex market can be broken up into four major trading sessions:  the Sydney session, the Tokyo session, the London session, and the New  York session. Below are tables of the open and close times for each  session:

http://www.babypips.com/school/trading-sessions.html

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
You can see that in between each session, there is a period of time  where two sessions are open at the same time.  From 3:00-4:00 am EDT,  both the Tokyo and London markets are open, and from 8:00-12:00 am EDT,  both the London and New York markets are open.

Naturally, these are the busiest times during the market because  there is more volume when two markets are open at the same time. This  makes sense because during those times, all the market participants are  wheelin' and dealin', which means that more money is transferring hands.

Now, you're probably looking at the Sydney open and thinking why it  shifts two hours. You'd think that Sydney's open would only move one  hour when the U.S. adjusts for standard time, but remember that when the  U.S. shifts one hour back, Sydney actually moves forward by one hour  (seasons are opposite in Australia). You should always remember this if  you ever plan to trade during that time period.

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
For more information about forex trading hours, you can check out   Let's take a look at the average pip movement of the major currency pairs during each trading session.

From the table, you will see that the European session normally provides the most movement.

Trading Sessions Tokyo Session London Session New York Session Session Overlaps Best Days of the Week to Trade

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Best Times to Trade:
When two sessions are overlapping of course! These are also the  times where major news events come out to potentially spark some  volatility and directional movements.  Make sure you bookmark the Market  Hours cheat sheet to take note of the Opening and Closing times. The European session tends to be the busiest out of the three. The middle of the week typically shows the most movement, as the pip range widens for most of the major currency pairs.  Worst Times to Trade:
Sundays - everyone is sleeping or enjoying their weekend! Fridays - liquidity dies down during the latter part of the U.S. session. Holidays - everybody is taking a break. Major news events - you don't want to get whipsawed! During American Idol, the NBA Finals, or the Superbowl. http://www.babypips.com/school/best-...-to-trade.html

GBPUSD, Monthly, 2010 December 11

GBPUSD, Weekly 2010 December 11

Monthly and Weekly seems to move the market price within the triangle.

So it's better to wait here for a breakout, ... and if so,... then it could be a strong movement either up or down.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
GBPUSD, Daily, 2010 December 11

GBPUSD, H4, 2010 December 11

The Daily is omne of the important now, lines are getting extremly narrow, so a breakout could expected with a higher probability, isnt it?

H4: ...the most powerful chart here!

...but at H4 we see a divergence and the EMA200 seems to be a strong support line. So if you get in the market with some enter shorts take the stop loss over the EMA200 line. EMA20 has crossong the EMA50 at point P1 so it could be that the EMA50 is considered to be a new support line in conjunction with the lower line of BB.

H4 seems one of the most powerful charts if EMA lines like EMA20 and EMA50 are crossing and then the ups and downs between the upper line of BB and its middle line will command the price.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
GBPUSD, H1, 2010 December 11

GBPUSD, M30, 2010 December 11

Oh yes!, ...of course!, this kind of trading at H1 and M30 with a tighter spread major currency like GBPUSD is really self-explenatory!

At H1 you can trades the CCI(149) Tops and Bottoms with the upper line of BB (P3, P4, P5, P6) and the EMA100 support line (P1, P2) and by trading the M30 could be a great adventure by looking at CCI(14) Tops and Bottoms with the Pivotal Points. When EMA lines are heading for crossing you could often bet that the prices will run up to a higher important pivotal point, also when it's working out a divergence.

Hope it helps!

Kindest regards!

Hi Forexcube,

I am still taking the time to study this thread more in detail. Although it includes an indicator such as CCI, I think the MTF approach and use of S&R ( or Murr. Math lines ) make it unique. That is to say, you dont use the indicators for immediate buy/sell signals, but just as an addon to measure the momentum and real strength of the wave-like character of price. Very well done. It may need a long time of practice in terms of simple screentime, but it is worth it.

IMHO this is also one of the best threads for newer traders, apart from the J16 thread.

My favourite post is still : EURUSD 1h

Thank you and have a nice weekend !

see  #1131, please.

Hi msmarple

Smaller timeframes like H1 - see also this idea:

It is a simple method. You could use the 10 EMA. After you get an entry signal from the CCI Indicator (Top or Bottom), you could wait till a price bar closes below (above) 10 EMA to enter Short (Long). This method could help you to know when exactly you will enter and so you should have no second doubt about acting now or waiting a bit longer.

At the second enter short trade I would take the risk over to enter short at the price action (see the shooting star), may be with some more enter shorts at the 10 EMA crossover three bars later. You've to wait till the close of the candle ist at the other side of 10 EMA.

See also the Zig-Zag-Indicator at  #1134, please.

Kindest regards

May be it is very useful to support decisions in making entries when following the CCI(14) Top-and-Bottom-Trading.

This is a Zig-Zag-Indicator, which is not repainted.

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Hi FXcube,

thanks for the indicator. I set length to 14 as for the CCI, but I do not get the last line down on the EURUSD, H1 chart like yours...

What settings do you use?

In backtest it looks really good, but I read in another forum that the live drawing from high to low / low to high should be very slow...may be too slow for using it with the CCI top/bottom strategy. I will test it when market opens.

Thanks,

Oliver

Thank you Forexcube, I will have a look too when the market opens.

And thanks for the nice comment about my nickname, I am a collector of old movies since many years and so when I first encountered FF I automatically chose a movie character ( like in my many other film forums ), without thinking much about forum status or long-term commitment. Now since trading has become one of my main pursuits I just kept it, no need to prove anything to anyone.

The zigzag might be helpful, I also like to keep it simple and use MTF support and resistance levls, e.g. price action candles showing rejection or confirmation of these levels. More possible when I have the opportunity to post charts again.

Best regards,

May be one or another could use it in some form or another.

ToR_1.02.mq4

by Tom Balfe

This indicator shows you whether a pair is trending or ranging. For trending markets use moving averages and for ranging market use oscillators. It shows ADX values for multiple timeframes to help you decide which trading technique to use. Sometimes you'll see short-term trends against the H4 and D1 trend. It's up to you whether you trade in a ranging market. It seems to Tom Balfe that trading with the long-term trend is best. Having said that, the reason why Tom Balfe made this indicator is to let the trader decide at a glance what to do, or even to do nothing. Staying out of a market is a position too.

See the code at MetaEditor, please.

TA_1.14c.mq4

by Tom Balfe.

This indicator helps you trade by giving you two signals on multiple timeframes. It bases it's recommendations on RSI and stochastics.

5. Run MT4 platform.

6. In the upper Menu go to:

"Insert" -> "Indicators" -> "Custom".

You should be able to find there the indicator(s) you've added.

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
Thank you Forexcube, I will try it next week. The multi-timeframe reading can be very good ( with some of them ), but with most of them I found that CPU is on overload..... so I have been a bit wary of them, especially as I use MT4 only for charting and place my trades on Oanda.

As this has already been posted numerous times on other forums, I might as well recommend H. Liu`s currency strenght meter, simple but quite good as it was modified for less intense computer power.

Another kind of meter can be found in lawgirl´s thread, her MTF indicator basically measures RSI set to 3 on multiple timeframes. I have found this to be often even more accurate and real-time as those numbered or " arrow only " indicators.

I will have time tomorrow and next week to post charts and examples what I was trying to say.

A BIG thank you !

A group of interesting traders has ask me if I could make more an opening communication chat where all interested traders could take part immediately consecutive in my trading activities. This event could be that it'll produce costs. May be that I will do something when it will not alone produce costs but also save expenses. Actual it seems that I'm in a conference with a London group who have specializes in the fundamental analyses and in trading the news. This could be the perfect complement to what I'm doing. The pilot study is going on currently and if all being well and all will coming up to expectations, ...so it could be that in January 2011 it will be break the first ground.

Is your trading strategy more short term based? Have you also take a look at Weekly and Monthly chart? That may very well be that higher charts encourage your short frame analyses.

USDCHF, Daily, 2010 December 13

USDCHF, H4, 2010 December 13

USDCHF, H1, 2010 December 13

Self-explanatory!

Conclusion:

Trade the range at lower timeframes and the breakout at higher ones!

Daily is forming a triangle. Prices has touched the H4 lower line of BB. H4 and H1 CCI(14) are at the bottom. Set stop loss below the daily triangle, due to the possibility of a breakout downside. If so you have then at first take a look at the range (orange bottom line).

If the market price hold at 0.97/0.96 daily positive divergence might be intact,...a caused occasion for buying more longs.

Hope it helps!

Good morning Forexcube,

I am still going through the thread and sorting out possible questions. I like the CCI reaction very much, I was a RSI " fan " before.....

Your example : to buy @ 09:19 5 ( ! ) Lots eurusd and close it barely 20 pips later is high risk.

a) this is whipsaw time for me, a very good trader told me to wait for the typical end of major early move at around 10:00 GMT and then trade the correction. An alternative is to trade 1 hr before LO open, especially the last 5 min to the full hour is good.

b) where are the stops ?

c) eurusd has been in a risky mess, why not trade other pairs. Too many traders focusing on their 15 min chart on eu or gu and expect to make 100 pips every day.

My 2 cents, more questions/comments later.....

So the enter long orders at 8:40 and 8:50 wasn't overly clever! - yep,...really unprofessional!

CCI(14) has showing a top but the EMA Lines were going stright away deep upward.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---

Compensate and counterbalance all open high lot size trades if market will give you the chance.

So make up your market analyses at a lot of different currency pairs and time frames. There's no harm of you need 2 or 3 days for that! It's now your job to do it!

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
see #1167, please.

Set a time limit when you would have change all high sized loss order in a win. In two day? ,... may be in 1 week?,...by no later than 1 month?...

Okay you didn't know it in detail and the most part of the contracts should be dependend at the market environment. But you have taken your chart analyses and on the basis of your analyses you should come to a rating.

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
see #1172

see Step 1.

Don't wait that you could make any more profit when you let the trader further run in the win. It's not your task at the moment by minimizing the big lots of open orders.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
Minimize the loss (total amount) of the open trades.

see #1173, #1167, please.

Even better now.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
Repeat Step 1 and Step 2 so often you can do.

Example:

see, #1176 and #1177, please.

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Don't over-react.

You can close the first order AUDCAD 49.56 at #1177.

But this is only one 0.5 lot size. You've make your market analyses before. So no need to close it down. Let it run. Your account deposit looks much better now (-18'879.50$) compared with this one in the morning, see #1167, please (-36'329.51$). Isn't it?

...and be aware that the opened 6 Lot EURUSD and the 8.5 Lot USDCHF contracts are too much only for one single currency-pair. Look that you can make it smaller in the next days, may be today. (See also critical reflexions,  #1180).

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
Step 7 - Critical Reflexions.

E.G.

Weren't it too risky to close these high 24 Lot Hedging trades?

H4 was showing a divergence at the Pivotal DR1 1.3475.

Probabilities for a turn down seems to be great at that time by monitoring the M1/M5.

Market Tip

In Forex we don't have the burdon of financial statements  by itself. However, we can still analyze a currency's condition  (strength or weakness) based on a number of factors. Combined, these  give us a better indication of a particular trade's worthiness.

Forex Market isn't predictable - there are only different weighted pro and cons - so future market price should be more a matter of conjecture), you  should be familiar with a minimum:

(1) The currency's behavioral  characteristics, say how much does it move (hourly?, daily?, weekly?),  does it moves abruptly?, graduelly?, does it spike?;

(2) the  economies of the currency pairs (strong?, weak?, budget deficits or  surplius?);

(3) the general market trend (up, still, down);

(4) where  the current market price is relative to today's movement, yesterday's-,  last week's-, last month's-;

(5) how do the microcharts (M1, M5, M15,  M30, H1) relates to the macro- (4h, daily, weekly, monthly); and so on.

(6) Try to find out the currency-pairs at all hazards which could have better option for making a profit.

Market   Tip to connoted as trade examples - these are trades how  I would like   to realize it in the given market situation so to say a  display  windows  of some of my trades.

Kindest Regards

you could pointed out one possibility more,..., that

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
So if you trade M1, you have to take a look at M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily, the Pivotals and sometimes the Fibonaccis.

M1 Trading isn't a pleasure! You have to make much work before you go at M1 in the market.

That's fact!

You need concentrated attention.

Trade Example

Trade the daily pivotals at M5.

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
Fib has reached two times at 61.8.

May be it could be a favored option to trade the range at M5 and looking for a breakout outside the weekly triangle (#1232) or the daily 61.8 fib levels before going on with the trend and then coming back with the trades at the higher timeframes (Daily).

If price is likely to stay within the range or breakout the range, this  is where you really put speed of the market and momentum of price to  good use in your analysis.

With lots of speed and strong momentum, the range will likely be broken.  With little speed and weak momentum the range will likely hold and  continue.

Expert Advisor Programming "Creating Automated Trading Systems in MQL for MetaTrader 4" written by Andrew R. Young is in my room now.

Criticism

A great pity!

It's boring written, the code only in black and white, no colours, now images, and only 199 pages. Other programming books (like some of CC++) are written with scads of images, essentially more interesting, more powerful and importantly more imaginative, but this one from Andrew R.Young is soul-destruyingly boring!,.. not worth a cent. Most of them you can read at internet free and a considerable amount more. Here was someone to take small paints to do something.

Trading any market carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Thank's msmarple!

These are some little open trades (250.-$ real account) , just now, never mind that the market price could go further down for 80-150 pips. If so it could be one more beneficial event for some additional Enter Longs.

Forex Broker Tricks

April 2, 2009 by Hass67

If you are serious about starting forex trading than you should know the games youre your forex broker can play with you. Most of the small forex traders dont know these facts and are easily taken for a ride by unscrupulous forex brokers.

Retail forex market where small traders like you and I trade forex is different than the interbank forex market. Interbank forex market is where big banks, corporations, hedge fund and other institutional investors exchange currencies. It is only open to big players.

With the advent of internet, retail forex trading became popular. Forex brokers work as intermediaries between the retail traders and the interbank market. Forex brokers popularize retail fx trading by offering online margin accounts. But beware retail forex market is not highly regulated. Due to poor regulation forex brokers can do what they want with immunity.

You need to know the games; a forex broker can play with you. If you dont know what games a forex broker can play with you, you will never succeed at forex trading. Understand how the broker can trick you:

Pricing is Not Transparent: Being an OTC (Over the Counter) market, forex broker can quote prices that may not be fair but you have accept them or choose another broker. The prices that your forex broker is going to quote to you, is the price that you will get. You cannot do anything about it.

Encouraging Leverage: Your forex broker will encourage you to use a  high leverage like 100-1 or 200-1. Leverage is good when you are winning  but it will wipe you out in case of a loss. Most of the retail forex traders are amateurs and dont know how to handle leverage, they expose themselves and get wiped out in the market quickly. The more you lose the more your broker will make. Dont use too high leverage.

Trading against you: Your forex broker will most probably will be trading against you! Since, most of the retail trades are too small in size; your forex broker cannot immediately offset this position in the interbank market. This gives them the opportunity to trade against you. The more you lose, the more your broker makes.

Practices that are unfair: Forex brokers and Casinos have the same  mentality: they dont like winner. If you are winning too much, the house  will be stacked against you. Your forex broker may make the execution  of your trades very difficult or start denying the service to you. Your  trade may not execute due to slippage. There are many games the broker  will play against you so beware.

Once you know these facts, you can use a scorecard for evaluating different forex brokers...

Hi londonprince

Thank you for your kind words.

I must unfortunately admit that I'm not a friend of forex simulators or forward and backtesting systems. I like making the trade in the reality with real money. So I can better reflect all the irregularities around the forex market. It's life in reality. When I post a demo account via my "public PC" on this thread here then exclusive of security questions.

Forex Broker Scams

Forex traders need to know about their forex brokers if they want to  really start trading forex trading. There are many myths and scams that  need to be exposed. Many retail forex traders are too simpleton to  understand the games the forex brokers play with them.

Retail forex market is new and different from forex interbank market.  Forex interbank market is only open to big players like banks,  corporations, hedge funds, pension funds and other institutional  investors and deals with large currency transactions.

Retail forex market was developed after the advent of the internet.  Retail forex brokers offer online margin accounts to retail forex  traders like you and me who are small time players in a huge market.  Retail forex market is loosely regulated that lets the forex brokers  play games with small forex traders.

Know these games before you start your forex trading. The following  facts can help you understand some of the games that can be played  against you:

Pricing is Not Transparent: Being an OTC (Over the  Counter) market, forex broker can quote prices that may not be fair but  you have accept them or choose another broker. The prices that your  forex broker is going to quote to you, is the price that you will get.  You cannot do anything about it.

Leverage: Forex brokers let you trade forex with a  high leverage like 100-1 or 200-1. Rather they will encourage you to use  more leverage. Using leverage allows you to make high gains with a  small price movement but it destroys you when you are on the wrong side  of the market. Since most of the forex traders dont know how to trade.  Giving you high leverage lets your broker gain when you lose.

Brokers trade against you: Since most of the retail  forex trades are too small in size, forex broker is not immediately able  to offset this position in the interbank market. This provides them the  chance to trade against you. Most of the retail traders dont know how  to trade. So you lose and your broker wins.

Practices that are unfair: Forex brokers and Casinos  have the same mentality: they don’t like winners. If you are winning  too much, the house will be stacked against you. Your forex broker may  make the execution of your trades very difficult or start denying the  service to you. Your trade may not execute due to slippage. There are  many games the broker will play against you so beware.

Forex brokers are more of a marketing machine than market makers.  Forex brokers need a constant stream of new clients to keep making money  since most of the new traders dont survive longer than a few months.  Forex brokers spend vast sums of money on advertising to entice new  traders. If you go on Google and search any forex related keyword, you  will find most of the ads are by forex brokers. Forex brokers give many  incentives to you to start trading.

Forex brokers want you to trade more. They use many methods as  incentives to make you do that. One of the methods is to hold a Forex  Trading Contest by announcing cash prizes of $2000, $1000 and $500 for  the top three.  In order to win, many small traders get wiped out losing  their money. This is just a trick forex brokers use to make you trade  more. The more you trade, the more money your broker makes. This trick  is similar to a lottery.

Forex brokers are free to offer any price to their clients. Most of  the brokers get price quotes from the interbank market with a 1 pip or  even lower spread. To this pip spread they add 2 or 3 or even more pips  as the price quote to their clients. Just imagine by acting only as  middlemen between the interbank market and retail forex trader, forex  brokers make risk free profits of 3 to 4 pips on a round trip trade.

There is a practice used by forex brokers called Price Shading. For  example, if the broker is convinced that Euro is on an uptrend and its  price is going to rise, the broker will shade his price quote slightly  higher to take advantage of the likely increase in Euro price. One of  the classic tricks used by many brokers is to trip stop losses with a  single momentary blip. Brokers have all the information about stop  losses placed by their clients. So, if he finds many stop losses at a  certain level, there will be a momentary spike in the price feed that  will trip most of the stop losses.

You can’t do anything. It was a momentary spike, so small that it  only tripped the stop losses. You can never complain, your broker will  always say there was sudden big transaction in the interbank market or  his price feed is faster and better in reflecting the interbank rates.

Hi Forexcube,

you have some interestign concepts here, I'll like to learn somethigns from you as a novice trader, any help will do

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
Hi TenFX

The last example isn't something for traders at beginner levels. Really not!

Market prices were going at Pivotal Points and M1 and M5 was at the CCI(14) high. Often it's quite simple like this. The rest is grit and by experience. Often things come out so simple.

Before you intend to take this high risk be updated that you have make enough profit at your accounts, may be then it's better time to copy this high risk trading style.

May be I can invite you to read some examples referenced at #1.

The most part I trade extremely conservative.

Kindest regards

Well ive been thinking about you and looking a lot at the CCI divergence while i trade and going back seeing how it would work out, and it would seem it has a lot to it. I think the statements you post is possibly your best statements, but regardless you are one or the most honest and kind traders i have talked to here on FF. At the good times price bounces between my own signals and CCI divergence.

I am using, and have been for quite some time now envelopes, or rather i got to it in a strange fashion, i calcultated them through trial and error from MAs. Well anyway, how is your experience with the CCI divergence on M1?

I will post my template here so you can have a look if you like. Dashed lines are signals, depending on the volumes. I am sure you can see pretty much what they do, and why there is one that is thicker then the other two.

I use it on E/U M1.

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
Hi yaed

Thank you for this template. If you could post some examples here in  future we can discuss for all practical purposes. Think about it.

"...how is your experience with the CCI divergence on M1?"

The lower the timeframe the weaker the arguments.  In a strong uptrend it's better to go at M1 with the maintrend, even if M1 would show a negative divergence; (...and may be think at #2, #4, please).

Happy New Year!

EURUSD, Daily, 2011 January 05

We've got hidden bearish divergence.  This occurs when price  makes a lower high (LH), but the oscillator is making a higher high  (HH). By now you've probably guessed that this occurs in a downtrend.  When you see hidden bearish divergence, chances are that the pair will  continue to shoot lower and continue the downtrend.

Don't forget that the market is in a sideway movement and has reached the upper line of the range.

Fib:

Today the market price has touched the 38.2 level.

May be good chances for several shorts at lower time frames (H1/H4) and trade the M5/M15/M30 now and then (e.g. #1313).

Wish all of you success and happiness!

Hi mate!

your system looks very easy and very effective. I'm going to learn about it more and trade the TCT.

Just a question. What do you think about 15M TF trading with H4 Murray M. Lines setting? Isn't H4 too much for 15M?

I see H1 Murray Math are very often pretty close to trade between them.

Btw, the TCT entry signals (I've made some backtesting) are the best I've seen .

I usualy don't have a problem to recognize where the price is going but my entries suck as much as you can imagine. That is why I am still looking for a system which will fit me at the best level.

Thank you.

Does the position of prices relative to ema and the public?

And ive been thinking about it ever since. To judge from your statements you dont need any modification to your understanding of price, im only at 70-85% accuracy, so i would not want your better judgement clouded by my comparably fuzzy logic. At the moment, im working on taking price apart bit by bit and analyzing its every move, every nook and cranny, every possibility and impossibility. It was still only a couple of months since i started being profitable, so i cannot say i have your track record and confidence behind me. Anyway, remember to relax this weekend and stop thinking about trading for a while.

There is another matter of interest relating to this. Consider the fate of this thread:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post4297681

Consider this: Given a set of circumstances A, the outcome B is given. I am not sure why 155 posts was removed from that thread, but i think its important to note that it was. Consider also much of my trades, and yours as well although you dont utilize the same visualisation aid (indicators) is similiar to how 4qx traded, see where i am going with this?

Hello porfirio ,

Yes restraint is necessary to have when trading Cell Trading, not just wait for drawdown and properly close the warrant.

Now trading at M5 taymfree, left a couple of questions.

At a more senior taymfrey better pay attention to?

Does the position of price in relation to EMA and the public?

Does  the position indicator rsi at the entrance to the market +, -100, or  you can open the position when the rsi to be near 0, and cci near the  level of 200 or more?

Hello Forexcube , I hope you at this time to answer my questions

--------

Да выдержку надо иметь при торговле по Cell Trading , не только выжидать на просадках но и правильно закрывать ордера.

Сейчас торгую на M5 таймфрее , осталось пару вопросов.

На какой более старший таймфрей лучше обращать внимание ?

Имеет ли значение положение цены относительно EMA и каких ?

Имеет ли значение положение индикатора rsi при входе в рынок  +,-100 или можно открывать позиции когда rsi находиться вблизи 0 , а cci возле уровня 200 и более ?

Привет Forexcube , Я надеюсь вы в этот раз ответите на мои вопросы

Long Term Carry Trade

Trading the Majors "Euro Dollar & "Dollar Swissi"

with regards to their nature; "Correlation" (Weekly/Monthly) (see #1344, please) and the "Currency Index"(see #1343 ,please)

I think with these two majors you can make money without waiting if price stayed exactly the same for long periods of time.

Refresher

A carry trade involves borrowing or selling a financial instrument  with a low interest rate, then using it to purchase a financial  instrument with a higher interest rate. While you are paying the low interest rate on the financial  instrument you borrowed/sold, you are collecting higher interest on the  financial instrument you purchased. Thus your profit is the money you  collect from the interest rate differential.

HI Forexcube thanks for your reply, I have been going thru thr examples at #1 and read thru the Inside bar  posts, I should say your method is quite simple, and can be very productive. I have been able to perform 2 trades today practicing your system.

I have traded long on the GBPUSD twice with profit on the H1 with the CCI at Tops last week friday I did a short also using RSI

Today I have Traded 2 Longs on the GBPUSD with CCI at bottom

First trade I did not wait for RSI but RSI eventually crossed over

I took 20pips profit before a minor retracement

Second trade on the bounce of the retracement, I closed trade prematurely but made a nice 14pips profit.

Now i want to practice using the Pivot lines, in making my trades more profitable.

Sorry i havnt figured out how to uplaod the charts.

Daily Report: Euro Remains Pressured ahead of Bond Auctions

Euro remains broadly pressured in Asian session today as  markets are cautious ahead of peripheral government bond auctions this  week. In particular, Portugal, which's widely considered to be the most  likely country to seek bailout after Greece and Ireland, will sell as  much as EUR 1.25b debts this week. Spain and Italy will also have  respective bond auctions too. Technically, Euro is generally weak  against other major currencies. We're favoring more downside in EUR/USD  through 1.29 and EUR/GBP is expected to continue its decline towards 0.8  psychological level again. EUR/CHF and EUR/AUD are both expected to  make new record lows sooner or later.

Nice link. Thank you.

Topic: Carry Trades

I would invest 3/10 of all my intented trades of these two currency pairs last Monday (#1342).

Long USDCHF ~ 0,965

Long EURUSD ~ 1.2915

...and would invest 2/10 more if prices would go further down (e.g. EURUSD 1.25) and hold 5/10 in reserve (e.g. USDCHF 0.9/0.87).

Ratio  EURUSD/USDCHF: 1.0 / 1.5

On the meantime I would hedge all downs at H4 and Daily separately at 1/1 or 1/2 (say 1 carry part/two hedging parts), till 1/5.

I make my trading decision afterwards I have made a Multiple Time Frame Analyse.  Before I don't know which time frame I prefere for the market orders. The next one is I don't like to trade with a stop loss. Time Cell Trading is a trading concept which you can trade fast, simple and efficient at low level with stop loss and at an advanced level with or without any stop losses. The rest is Money- & Risk-Management. The last 25'000.-$ account had doubled within 10 days. If I have double an account I close it and open the next Account, due to the fact that I don't trade with a stop loss. My target is making 5-10 accounts net doubling per year. It could be that under some extreme volatile market environment over several days the complete deposit could been loosen, may be two or three times per year.

Trading without stop loss is the preferred concept to my trading personality  how to trade the market and how to multiply the profit. When I post Market Tips (see introduction at p.1, #1, please) here on this thread then it's in the most part of time without any stop loss filter. I have to hedge these orders several times in between times when the price would run in the counterpart direction.

Hope it helps

Kindest regards

Hi Gregory

"The economic situation in Europe..." that's sound like some fundamental data. I 'm a rank before a technical trader with a look at some fundamentals.

"...and many analysts predict..."

Here I have only to say that I'm not the crowd. Sorry, I preferre to built up my critical mind on myself and trade the currencies with my own analyses and not through other ones (like investment bankers, economic leaders...). I don't search the flock of sheep and I like to observe the market interline.

Kindest regards

Watch out!

...if you see results at investment bankers or other investment institutional like this.

So you can really hide a great loss in your profit sheet. This is WINDOW DRESSING!

These are only some Ger30Mar11 trades.

But

Today Ger30Mar11, 2011 January 13: H 7093 L 7045, max. 48 points difference (not much!).

It s pretty accurate using the divergence concept, I have been using it to trade 1min chart, by reading both 1min and 5min chart's cci, also adding a stochastic to find a entry point. Again, thx for ur education.

keep them coming.

Good diverg, but here !!

[quote=Gregory-1991;4311778]Hello Forexcube

Why did you decide what position to sell on the eur / usd will justify the risk?

The economic situation in Europe is improving, and many analysts predict a toast.

Hey Cube

The problem with CCI divergence i can see, is that it misses out on one candle, since i need to see a move towards the 0. Divergence is still a pretty nifty thing, but i have discovered it can be combined with setting a certain limit as to where price is very likely to continue do drop/climb if the CCI gets closer to 0.

Have you had any experience in such things, setting a limit in CCI as to where price will come home to MAs that is?

Here let me show you what i mean...

So red lines would for instance be nice places for shorts, based on a drop below the 140 line at the period 14, weighted close CCI. Have you tried anything like that?

--- 帖子 #1380 ---
Hi Forexcube,

Still following your thread with much interest.

I have 2 quick questions though.

Did you (and if so, why?) ditch the Murray Math indicator from your trading decisions?

And the last question is more out of pure interest, why do you keep restarting new demo accounts instead of running 1 or 2 demo accounts for a longer period? Having an account that has 6+ months of trading has so much more impact as a trading record than 10+ accounts that run for a short period of time. Just wondering about that.

Is it possible to get in touch, I might have something interesting.

Kind regards,

Sorry Gregory

The english translation machine seems to be so bad. I don't often understand the details in your questions. That's actual the main problem. You could post further on here and I'll give you an answer.

Hi Pilli

No, I use it further on. Murray Math seems to be clear I thought. I won't have any problems to put it on the charts again in the future. Charts seems to be clearer the fewer things are on it.

I like to trade with Non-Stop-Loss. Two or three times a year big capital players make a turmoil at the Forex Market so that most of these non-stop-accounts will gotten pulverize. The only reason! ....Ah, anymore, the other is more a security question.

You can mail a private message at first and in the following contact I can give you an e-mail, if I can to assume good intention. After that we can call.

Weekend Analysis: A Path To Forex Profits

by Selwyn Gishen (Contact Author | Biography)

There are three basic reasons for doing a weekend analysis. The first  reason is that you want  to establish a "big picture" view of a  particular market in which you are interested. Doing this analysis over  the weekend, when the markets are closed, is helpful because such an  analysis can be made when the markets are not in dynamic flux and,  therefore, you don't need to react to situations as they are unfolding.

Secondly, the analysis will help you to set  up your trading plans for the coming week, which in turn will help you  to decide what trading plans you might want to implement. Remember,  shooting from the hip can leave a hole in your pocket! Weekend analysis  should be more akin to an architect preparing a blue print from which he  will take the steps, based on his blue print, to construct the  different aspects of the building he's designed.

Finally, the  reason for undertaking a weekend analysis is to build a routine  preparation method that will help to build a trading plan in the area in  which you are focusing so you can establish the necessary mindset for  the upcoming week. A good analysis is how you can "psych" yourself up  for the oncoming trading activity. (Check out 9 Tricks Of the Successful Trader for more.)

Preparing for the Week
Since this is a forex  article, the emphasis is on the necessary preparation for trading forex  during the coming week. But the preparatory steps can also be used and  are helpful if you trade stocks, bonds or commodities.  It's important to remember that none of the markets are actually  separate, or trade in a vacuum. All the markets are interdependent, so  that in a global economy the purchase of bonds, equities, goods and  services all have an effect on the levels of supply and demand for  currencies. Therefore, the price levels of the various currencies will  vary when money flows around the world as investment searches for the highest and safest yields. (For a background, see our Forex Tutorial.)

Understand the Drivers

The  art of successful trading is partly due to an understanding of the  current relationships between markets and the reasons that these  relationships exist. It is important to understand the causative factors  that are in play at the moment. Remember, though, that these  relationships can and do change over time. Once you have a grasp on  the existing relationships, then a study of  price charts and the statements of the pundits, insiders, brokers and  news services can be either reinforcing or ignored depending on your particular reading of the circumstances.

For  example, a stock market recovery could be explained by investors who  are anticipating an economic recovery. These investors believe that  companies will have improved earnings  and, therefore, greater valuations in the future. Hence they believe  that now is a good time to buy! Or it can be that speculation, based on a  flood of liquidity,  is fueling momentum and that good old greed is pushing prices higher  and higher until all players are on board so that the selling can begin.

A weekend analysis should be a basis for an understanding of the circumstances currently in play. These are the true fundamentals. Therefore the first question to ask is, why? Why are these things happening? What are the drivers behind the market actions?

Technical Drivers

Many  technical analysts believe that patterns or certain price levels on  charts can also be the drivers of trader behavior. They believe that so  many traders are watching for these patterns that they become  self-fulfilling prophecies. There has long been a debate, for example,  whether a Fibonacci level is a number that is a measurement of some  natural force or whether it is valid just because so many people watch  for the number to occur and then trade accordingly. Whatever the reason,  there are certain patterns and levels that will trigger trader action.  (For more, see Can Technical Analysis Be Called A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?)

The News

The  news also fuels actions. Traders wait for the news releases to confirm  or deny their hypotheses and then enter or exit their trades. If these  news releases occur at certain technical levels then they attract even  more trader activity and can increase the odds of a successful trade.  Not every news release is always valid for timing a trade. Those  releases that occur at specific chart confluences can have a more  dramatic effect on the volatility of the market and will provide better  trading opportunities. (To learn more, see Trading On News Releases.)

Setting Up a Trading Plan
By  doing a weekend analysis, a trader can prepare for the coming week and,  depending on the type of trading he or she likes to do, such as scalping the news, or trading the five minute charts or waiting for a swing trade  setup, he or she will have a blueprint to guide his trading. The old  adage of "plan your trade – and trade your plan," is sage advice.

Chart the Indexes
It  is helpful for a trader to chart the important indexes for each market  on a longer time frame. This exercise can help a trader to determine  relationships between markets and whether a movement in one market is  inverse or in concert with the other.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend1.gif

Figure 1                               Source: netdania.com

As you can see in Figure 1, there is an inverse relationship between  gold and the dollar. As gold goes down in price, the dollar increases  and vice a versa.

For example, in 2009, gold was being driven to record highs. Was this move in response to the perception that paper money  was debasing so rapidly that there was a need to return to the hard  metal as a store of value? Or was this the result of cheap dollars  fueling a commodities boom? Or both? Could the speculators be promoting  the gold hedge concept to attract dollars from Main Street  into gold so that they can speculate on the momentum and then sell into  the strength once gold reaches certain levels? Speculation is a game  and how well it is played depends on the ability of the trader to  understand the driving factors.

Now that we know that gold has an  inverse relationship with the dollar, we can ask ourselves what will  happen if gold sells off, or what would happen to gold if the dollar  appreciates? We would expect an appreciating dollar to reduce the price  of gold. Could we also expect a sell off in gold to have an impact on  the dollar? Probably not, because many other commodities, stocks and  bonds all impact the dollar, not only gold. (Learn more in Using Technical Analysis In The Gold Markets.)

So  let us then turn to the dollar index chart to try and determine if  there is a potential trade set-up. In this instance we note that the  dollar has traded down to a level of 75.00, which is at the 127.8  extension of the previous upswing. It is also trading at a 78% retracement of the swing from March, 2008 through November, 2009.

This indicates a potentially strong resistance level for the dollar.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend2.gif                               Figure 2                               Source: netdania.com

The dollar index should bounce off of the 78% retracement from the  low of March 2008 to the high of April 2009. At this level it is worth  listening closely to the pundits as to how they explain why the dollar  should start increasing in value against other currencies, especially in  the light of the consensus at the time that the dollar was likely to  weaken against the basket of currencies due to the threat of future  inflation. At these levels it is worth watching the news and listening  to the experts to garner clues as to what the sentiment is. If the  markets are going to turn, sentiment will start to shift in favor of the  turn and a trader can capitalize on this fact.

Is There a Consensus in Other Markets?
By  charting other instruments on the same weekly or even monthly basis, we  can gain a perspective of whether or not the markets are reaching a  turning point consensus. Then we can take advantage of the consensus to  enter a trade in an instrument that will be affected by the turn. For  example, dollar yen indicates an oversold position with talk in the market place that the BOJ  could intervene to weaken the yen. Japanese exports are affected  because of the strong yen. Without any weakening of the yen, a Japanese  recovery was likely to be impaired. (Learn more in The U.S. Dollar And The Yen: An Interesting Partnership.)

Gold Chart Provides Interesting Perspective
The  gold chart indicates that a level is being reached at which many  traders could take profits. A cheap dollar has fueled a gold rally. The  dollar has enabled a carry trade in gold, but at some point there will  be profit taking and I would look to a Fibonacci level to time a sell off. (Check out Taking The Magic Out Of Fibonacci Numbers for more.)

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend3.gif

Figure 3                               Source: netdania.com

In summary, we see that the dollar index is bouncing at two strong  Fibonacci levels, while at the same time gold is trading to a 161.8  extension, which is also strong resistance.

Follow-up
Weekend Analysis: A Path To Forex Profits

To find a currency trade for the coming week, a look at whether  the  USDJPY indicates that there is support at around the 85 level. At  the  double bottom around 85.00 it would be worth placing an order in the   market to go long the USDJPY with a stop at say 84.50. Since there was   no sure fire way of knowing whether the USDJPY will trade lower than   84.00, one had to enter a trade with a tight stop and wait and see. If you get stopped out, wait for the appropriate signal on a shorter-term chart to take the trade again.

The chart below, Figure 4, which depicts the USDJPY, is a monthly showing a double bottom.   The currency was also trading down to a 161.8 extension of the wave   marked with a blue line. This adds to the possibility that there would   be a strong buying action of dollars against the yen at that level.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend4.gif

Figure 4                               Source: netdania.com

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend5.gif

Figure 5                               Source: netdania.com

On the weekly chart of the USDJPY, Figure 5, we can see a triple bottom.   Our analysis and radar is now heightened to a long USDJPY trade, which   we can take on a shorter time frame, depending on our personal   preferences. The longer-term charts are suggesting a possible bounce as   the dollar strengthens, gold weakens and the dollar gains against the   yen.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...e/Weekend6.gif

Figure 6

A trade could have been taken on the four-hour chart. In this case there is a 400 pip  move to the upside. This was a high odds trade and easy to detect. Not  every trade is so obvious!  If the move has already occurred, then the  question is whether to  chase the trade or not. Of course there are  trading systems that buy on  pullbacks into the trend and so on. Each  trader has to determine his own  methodology and test it over a period  of time to determine the  expectancy of the system. Consistency is what  counts. (To learn more,  read Devising A Medium-Term Forex Trading System.)

To Trade or Not to Trade
There is a much higher  chance of a successful trade if one can find  turning points on the  longer time frames, then switch down to a  shorter frame to fine-tune an  entry. The first trade can be at the  exact Fibonacci level or double  bottom as indicated on the longer term  chart, and if this fails then a  second opportunity will often occur on a  pullback or test of the support  level.

Look for the low hanging fruit and be patient. Patience,  discipline and  preparation will set you apart from traders who simply  trade on the  fly without any preparation.  (For more tips, read The Most Reliable Indicator You've Never Heard Of.)

Is there a buy-and-hold strategy in forex, or is the only way to make money by trading?

Typically  there are different ways to trade in most markets. Traders have been  classified into three groups, primarily based on the time frame they  prefer to trade. For simplicity, we can label these three groups as day traders, swing traders and position traders. Some people consider a position's trade or buy-and-hold strategy as an investment, but in reality it is just a long term trade.

Nevertheless, in the forex market,  one can hold a position for as long as a few minutes to a few or more  years. Depending on the goals of the trader, one can take a position  based on the fundamental economic trends in one country versus another.  For example, a long-term trade in the forex market, or a buy and hold  position, if one prefers that term, would have been good for someone who  had sold dollars to buy euros  back in the early 2000's and then held on to that position for a few  years. Suppose an American buys shares in a company in Europe, they will  have pay for those shares in euros, thus there is a requirement to  convert dollars into euros. Not only is the American speculating on the  growth of the European company, but also on the appreciation of the euro  against the dollar. In this example, the American may have benefited  from an appreciating value of the shares that he or she bought, but also  benefit from an appreciating currency. Of course, in the converse, had  someone in Europe bought shares in a company like General Motors (NYSE:GM),  they would have had to pay for those shares in dollars but would have  lost value in both the shares and the currency during the same time  period.

If one wants to buy and hold a currency, one would possibly sell a currency that pays a low interest rate, such as the yen and buy a currency that pays a high interest rate, such as the Australian dollar. This would be considered a carry trade,  where the trader will earn the interest differential between the two  currencies. While he knows how much interest he will receive, he does  not know how the two currencies will continue to perform against each  other.

Most of the Forex traders though, tend to be short term  traders, constantly timing the market swings in the hope of profiting  from doing so. (For more, see Forex Tutorial: The Forex Market.)

9 Tricks Of The Successful Trader

by Selwyn Gishen (Contact Author | Biography)

For all of its numbers, charts and ratios, trading is more art than  science. Just as in artistic endeavors, there is talent involved, but  talent will only take you so far. The best traders hone their skills  through practice and discipline. They perform self analysis to see what  drives their trades and learn how to keep fear and greed out of the  equation. In this article we'll look at nine steps a novice trader can  use to perfect his or her craft; for the experts out there, you might  just find some tips that will help you make smarter, more profitable  trades, too.

Step 1. Define your goals and  then choose a style of trading that is compatible with those goals. Be  sure your personality is a match for the style of trading you choose.

Before  you set out on any journey, it is imperative that you have some idea of  where your destination is and how you will get there. Consequently, it  is imperative that you have clear goals in mind as to what you would  like to achieve; you then have to be sure that your trading method is  capable of achieving these goals. Each type of trading style requires a  different approach and each style has a different risk profile, which  requires a different attitude and approach to trade successfully. For  example, if you cannot stomach going to sleep with an open position in the market then you might consider day trading. On the other hand, if you have funds that you think will benefit from the appreciation of a trade over a period of some months, then a position trader  is what you want to consider becoming. But no matter what style of  trading you choose, be sure that your personality fits the style of  trading you undertake. A personality mismatch will lead to stress and  certain losses. (For more, see Invest With A Thesis.)

Step 2. Choose  a broker with whom you feel comfortable but also one who offers a  trading platform that is appropriate for your style of trading.

It is important to choose a broker who offers  a trading platform that will allow you to do the analysis you require.  Choosing a reputable broker is of paramount importance and spending time  researching the differences between brokers will be very helpful. You  must know each broker's policies and how he or she goes about making a  market. For example, trading in the over-the-counter market or spot market  is different from trading the exchange-driven markets. In choosing a  broker, it is important to read the broker documentation. Know your  broker's policies. Also make sure that your broker's trading platform is  suitable for the analysis you want to do. For example, if you like to  trade off of Fibonacci numbers,  be sure the broker's platform can draw Fibonacci lines. A good broker  with a poor platform, or a good platform with a poor broker, can be a  problem. Make sure you get the best of both. (For related reading, see How To Pay Your Forex Broker.)

Step 3. Choose a methodology and then be consistent in its application.

Before  you enter any market as a trader, you need to have some idea of how you  will make decisions to execute your trades. You must know what  information you will need in order to make the appropriate decision  about whether to enter or exit a trade. Some people choose to look at  the underlying fundamentals of the company or economy, and then use a chart to determine the best time to execute the trade. Others use technical analysis;  as a result they will only use charts to time a trade. Remember that  fundamentals drive the trend in the long term, whereas chart patterns  may offer  trading opportunities in the short term. Whichever methodology you  choose, remember to be consistent. And be sure your methodology is  adaptive. Your system should keep up with the changing dynamics of a  market. (For related reading, see What is the difference between fundamental and technical analysis and Blending Technical And Fundamental Analysis.)

Step 4. Choose a longer time frame for direction analysis and a shorter time frame to time entry or exit.

Many  traders get confused because of conflicting information that occurs  when looking at charts in different time frames. What shows up as a  buying opportunity on a weekly chart could, in fact, show up as a sell  signal on an intraday chart. Therefore, if you are taking your basic  trading direction from a weekly chart and using a daily chart  to time entry, be sure to synchronize the two. In other words, if the  weekly chart is giving you a buy signal, wait until the daily chart also  confirms a buy signal. Keep your timing in sync.

Step 5. Calculate your expectancy.

Expectancy  is the formula you use to determine how reliable your system is. You  should go back in time and measure all your trades that were winners  versus all your trades that were losers. Then determine how profitable  your winning trades were versus how much your losing trades lost.

Take  a look at your last 10 trades. If you haven't made actual trades yet,  go back on your chart to where your system would have indicated that you  should enter and exit a trade. Determine if you would have made a  profit or a loss. Write these results down. Total all your winning  trades and divide the answer by the number of winning trades you made.  Here is the formula:

E= [1+ (W/L)] x P – 1

where:

W = Average Winning Trade
L = Average Losing Trade
P = Percentage Win Ratio

Example:
If  you made 10 trades and six of them were winning trades and four were  losing trades, your percentage win ratio would be 6/10 or 60%. If your  six trades made $2,400, then your average win would be $2,400/6 = $400.  If your losses were $1,200, then your average loss would be $1,200/4 =  $300. Apply these results to the formula and you get; E= [1+ (400/300)] x  0.6 - 1 = 0.40 or 40%. A positive 40% expectancy means that your system  will return you 40 cents per dollar over the long term.
Step 6. Focus on your trades and learn to love small losses.

Once you have funded your account, the most important thing to remember is that your money  is at risk. Therefore, your money should not be needed for living or to  pay bills etc. Consider your trading money as if it were vacation  money. Once the vacation is over your money is spent. Have the same  attitude toward trading. This will psychologically prepare you to accept  small losses, which is key to managing your risk. By focusing on your  trades and accepting small losses rather than constantly counting your  equity, you will be much more successful.

Secondly, only leverage your trades to a maximum risk of 2% of your total funds. In other words, if you have $10,000 in your trading account, never let any trade lose more than 2% of the account value, or $200. If your stops are farther away than 2% of your account, trade shorter time frames or decrease the leverage. (For further reading, see Leverage's Double-Edged Sword Need Not Cut Deep.)

Step 7. Build positive feedback loops.

A  positive feedback loop is created as a result of a well-executed trade  in accordance with your plan. When you plan a trade and then execute it  well, you form a positive feedback pattern. Success breeds success,  which in turn breeds confidence - especially if the trade is profitable.  Even if you take a small loss but do so in accordance with a planned  trade, then you will be building a positive feedback loop.

Step 8. Perform weekend analysis.

It  is always good to prepare in advance. On the weekend, when the markets  are closed, study weekly charts to look for patterns or news that could  affect your trade. Perhaps a pattern is making a double top  and the pundits and the news are suggesting a market reversal. This is a  kind of reflexivity where the pattern could be prompting the pundits  while the pundits are reinforcing the pattern. Or the pundits may be  telling you that the market is about to explode. Perhaps these are  pundits hoping to lure you into the market so that they can sell their  positions on increased liquidity.  These are the kinds of actions to look for to help you formulate your  upcoming trading week. In the cool light of objectivity, you will make  your best plans. Wait for your setups and learn to be patient. (For  information on determining what the market's telling you, read Listen To The Market, Not Its Pundits.)

If  the market does not reach your point of entry, learn to sit on your  hands. You might have to wait for the opportunity longer than you  anticipated. If you miss a trade, remember that there will always be  another. If you have patience and discipline you can become a good  trader. (To learn more, see Patience Is A Trader’s Virtue.)

Step 9. Keep a printed record.

Keeping  a printed record is one of the best learning tools a trader can have.  Print out a chart and list all the reasons for the trade, including the  fundamentals that sway your decisions. Mark the chart with your entry  and your exit points. Make any relevant comments on the chart. File this  record so you can refer to it over and over again. Note the emotional  reasons for taking action. Did you panic? Were you too greedy? Were you  full of anxiety? Note all these feelings on your record. It is only when  you can objectify your trades that you will develop the mental control  and discipline to execute according to your system instead of your  habits.

Bottom Line

The steps above will lead  you to a structured approach to trading and in return should help you  become a more refined trader. Trading is an art and the only way to  become increasingly proficient is through consistent and disciplined  practice. Remember the expression: the harder you practice the luckier  you'll get.

Well thanks. My public PC could have caught a virus, may be from someone of FF. So I have make a recover in the next days. This program makes "print scrn" and copy other things at the moment. They don't understand that I have my real accounts somewhere else but not at this public PC. (Stupid guy's!).

Hi PhAnTi?

For several weeks you have given me a link to your friend from England. Could it be that some virus transfers (e.g. "HiddenObject.Multi.Generic") was sent from him? From the timing and the appearance of the difficulties could it really be! May be it's necessarily that you e-mail me your right adress and your right name so we can discuss this topic to the end.

I have now to work over 1 day to recover all my data at this public PC. What a sh*t!

I'm not sure if I were willing to post this week may be the next time here again.

EURUSD, M1, 2011 January 19

M1 Trading - Example

If you trade M1 take a look at M5/M15 & H1/H4.

Price has nearly reached mR2 and the Murrey Math "Overshoot Level" [+1/8].

Enter short here and go out when CCI(14) is at the Bottom.

This market environment has had a higher probabilitiy for making a short profit. I like to go in the market with a higher risk (higher lot sizes) but only for a few minutes. In & Out! Extremely short. That's all. Then you can wait till the next day or the day after or so. Once two times a day it's seems okay for me but even not more.

Why here? Volatility has increase dramatically and the EMA Lines are getting narrower in conjunction with a round number 1.3500 and the mR2 pivotal point. All these "micro-market-events" ("MME's") might be powerful arguments.

Be aware: You can't trade this way all the day long! Then you could lose all your money!

I do not know whether you should learn Russian, there is nothing good in the post-Soviet space was not. Besides saying the money can be all or virtually all

Rather, I need to learn English, which I do

Хорошая доходность , жаль только что торгуете на демо счете "как я понял"

Почему вы не хотите открыть реальный счет ?

Не знаю стоит ли вам учить русский , нечего хорошего в странах пост советского пространства нет. Кроме поговорки за деньги можно все или практически все

Скорее мне надо выучить английский , что я и делаю

Hi Gregory-1991

The main reason for this Demo Account and this public PC is a security question. I don't think it's clever to publish some of your real accounts.

I think learning  Russian could be good for the international commitment like Mandarin too.

Hi FXcube,

how exactly do you use the "i-fractalsEx" indicator?

As I know, it repaints and uses 6 bars before and after of the actual price bar to draw the arrow. In my opinion it therefore cannot be used in live trading, only in seeing the extremes of price in the history more clearly.

Do you agree?

http://www.babypips.com/blogs/pipsyc...ystem.htmlDoes Your Personality Match Your System?

Posted 15:00 17 December 2010

Does Your Personality Match Your System?

In his book, "Mechanical Trading Systems: Pairing Trader Psychology  with Technical Analysis," author Richard Weissman identifies three basic  trader personality profiles: trend-following, mean-reversion, and day-trading types.

Trend-Following Systems

Weissman enumerates two traits necessary for successful trend-followers: patience and fortitude.

Trend-following mechanical systems  hopefully get traders in strong directional moves, and signals  typically form when the trend has already begun. A typical entry  strategy may be to buy at recent highs or sell at recent lows, in  anticipation that the price will make a new high or low later on. This  may seem counter-intuitive to the majority of traders who like to pick  "tops" and "bottoms," but that's what sets trend-followers apart from  the rest.

The strength of this method is that if you catch a strong trend, you  can come up with huge winning trades relative to your initial risk.  But  of course, no system is fool proof and there are tradeoffs to grabbing  potentially big wins.

As the saying goes, "markets range 70-80% of the time." That means  catching a strong trend can be rare, and sticking to a trend-following  system requires that you endure several small losses when your entry  signals have you jumping in when the market consolidates or pulls back.

To be a trend-following trader you must be comfortable with  potentially having a low win ratio, but as long as your winning trades  generate enough profits to outpace your losses, then that's all that  matters.

So the questions you have to ask yourself are, "do I have the mental fortitude to handle more losses than wins AND do I have the patience  to ride the winning trades to their full profit potential?"  If you  answered "yes" to these questions, or if you feel stressed having to  come up with numerous trade decisions in a day, then trend-following  mechanical systems may be the right entry/exit method for you.

Mean Reversion Systems

Aside from trend-following systems, there are systems that are based  on the "mean reversion" theory.   In terms of price action, the theory  states that on average, markets are more often trading within a range  than trend, and when the market goes beyond its average range of  historical volatility, it tends to fall back to the middle of that  range, or the "mean." These systems aim to look for probable reversal  points (i.e. tops and bottoms) where price movement could change  direction.

The major difference is that while trend following systems aim to  "ride the trend" for large profits, mean reversion systems normally have  an exit in mind based off key support or resistance levels.  This means  a lot more smaller winning trades.

A couple of indicators used in mean reversion systems are the ADX and Stochastic.  The ADX helps identify whether the market is in a trend or rangebound,  while the Stochastic indicates potential overbought and oversold  conditions that tend to precede a  reversal.

The key to utilizing a mean reversion system, especially during the  long-term timeframes, is maintaining rock solid discipline. Using this  method could put you in the market against a strong trend, which can be  psychologically difficult if it doesn't turn your way.  Also, there can  be many distractions and obstacles that cause psychological stress for a  trader, such as the media and other traders.  You must train yourself  to follow your system's rules no matter what and remember that the  strength of a mean reversion system is the high probability that markets  will stay in a range.

Day Trading Systems

Lastly, we have day trading systems. These can be trending or mean  reversion systems, but on a shorter time frame--Weissman cites that  these generate signals for trades that last 10 days or less. Market  junkies who have a knack for these kinds of fast-paced systems usually  look at the hourly time frame or lower to aim for smaller profits and  place tight stop losses.

According to Weissman, mechanical systems benefit short-term traders  the most as the frequency of making trade decisions arise. By using a  mechanical system that already outlines what entry and exit levels to  take with pre-determined risk-reward ratios, a day trader is somehow  relieved from stress.

However, this is not to say that intraday systems are all sugar, spice, and everything nice. The biggest drawdown  to using them is that they are labor-intensive. Traders have to be  glued to their screens during trading hours either to be ready to act on  valid signals or to monitor/adjust their trades.

Dealing with potentially volatile intraday market action, a trader  must be able to quickly make sound decisions. Mental agility is critical  for someone to master day trading systems and if you think that you  have the capacity to find Zen amid the chaos, you may want to try out an  intraday system.

So what's your trading personality?

You have to remember that regardless of what kind of system you're  using, the market will always find a way to put you in between a rock  and a hard place.  There will be times that you will have more losers  than winners, trades go quickly against you, or you'll have to let go of  some of your unrealized profits.

But knowing what you are comfortable with and finding the system or  method that matches your personality will help you better adapt to the  always-changing market environment.

So if you think that you aren't so good in calling shots under  pressure, perhaps you may want to stay away from short-term systems. On  the other hand, if you think you have the discipline to stick to your  plan even when price action goes against you, you may want to try out a  long-term mean reversion system.

So does your personality match the trading system that you are using? If not, how about checking out our Forex forums or MeetPips.com to find something new?  Good luck!

Being Positive is Not Enough

While a positive mental attitude is important, it is not enough.     Those of us who are in forex currency trading also need to be able to do the following:  Use a trading method that has an edge BUT only when all the pieces  come together to create a solid setup with a high probability of  success. Stay focused on attaining their goals and constantly thinking about winning.   Unless you have an approach that works over a period of time and stay  focused and disciplined in sticking with it, all the positive mental  attitude exercises will not help you.

To begin, you must go back to the most elementary question, 'What type of a forex trader do I want to become?'  A scalper, intraday, or a swing trader? Based on the above, what time frames will I trade? Will I use traditional lagging indicators or a forward looking approach? Do I look at other markets to gain clues for future FX price movements? Is my initial trading plan robust and does it hold up over a large sample size of trades? Does my trading approach only look at the market one dimensionally? Do I know how to properly assess risk and manage position size accordingly? Can I sit in front of my screen and fight the temptation to trade every zig and zag or "signal" from the forums?   If you are unsure about any of the answers from above, a positive mental attitude will not benefit you much.

Becoming a proficient trader is a journey that never ends, you simply  move on to different stages of understanding and effectiveness.

5 Common Mental Mistakes New Traders Make

Before you open a real live account it is important that you  familiarize yourself with the most common mental mistakes new traders  make. You'll  probably still make them anyway, but at least you'll  actually be aware you're making them which hopefully will make easier  for you to correct them.
1. Overconfidence

Trading for a living can be a dream come true, but it can also be a  nightmare. If believe trading is easy,  you're done before you even  started. Trading is not easy. Trading is hard. Real hard. It's hard to  consistently remain mentally focused and stay disciplined. Know that  going in and you increase your chances of success big time.
2. Lack of Emotional Control

Your mind always assumes the worse. It does that to protect you from  harm. Because there is a potential that you'll lose money and all the  mental anguish that brings, the mind tells you not to do a trade.

You have to learn how to override this self-protecting mechanism if  you want to be a trader. Talk to your mind. Tell it you are fine with  doing the trade. Remind it that have a stop placed and you will not be  harmed if it doesn't work out. Convince your mind that in order to make  money trading you need to take risks and the risks that you are taking  have been carefully planned and measured.
3. Fooling yourself

Once you are in a trade do not try and justify its merit. The market  does that for you. The final outcome of your trade should be a stop loss  triggered, breakeven, or profit taken Once the trade is completed,  don't dwell on it. Every trade is different and what worked this time  may fail next time. Review it briefly and go on to next trade. Focus on  the overall trading and don't spend too much time on each individual  trade. This will make you an excellent trader. Accept the outcome of  your trades. But don't accept not sticking to your game plan.
4. Jumping the gun

Traders are constantly jumping into the right position at the wrong  time because they're afraid they are going to miss it, especially at  market turning points. Don't be afraid to miss the first 25% of the  move; and get out after 75%. Catching 50% of a confirmed move will  produce awesome results. You will also not have to deal with getting  stopped out and then watch the price reverse and go in your direction.
5. Not Thinking in Probabilities

Accept your trade losses as being normal. Don't beat yourself up over  them or try to unnecessarily tinker with preset stop loss and take  profit. Don't expect to be right 100% of the time.

Positive Thinking Powers your Potential

Being successful, whether it's as a Forex trader, a business owner,  or even as a parent, takes a lot of personal development.  Day after day  you have to deal with many uncertainties, some known and many others  unknown.  You are continually tested by your surroundings (the currency  market, your employees or coworkers, your children), and how you react  before, during and after these challenges all play part in your success.

As currency traders we all have those days (or weeks) when things  just don't go our way.  Our losses are overshadowing our wins, and we  can't seem to consistently win.  We start to wonder if we can ever make  any "real" money and if becoming a full-time trader will ever be  realized.

"Why did I ever get into currency trading?  It's nothing but a stress  builder and a gigantic head ache.  Who am I kidding? I think my hair is  falling out!"

If you've been feeling this way and are asking yourself some of the  same questions, it's time to sit down and work on your positive  thinking.  Any successful trader will tell you that he has made the  mental decision to be as positive as possible in thinking, acting and  doing, and that having a positive mind is critical in overcoming the  setbacks brought on while trading.

So what can you do to become a better positive thinker?

Start off the morning by looking at yourself in the mirror and saying  "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and gosh darn it, people LIKE me!"   And say it just like Stuart Smiley from Saturday Night Live... with  enthusiasm!  No really, promoting yourself to YOU is a great first step  in the right direction.  It helps you get in the right mind set, and  helps you to start your day thinking positive thoughts.  If looking in a  mirror scares you, I'm sorry...try just saying it out loud to yourself.

Next, observe your negative thoughts and understand that only you can  change them.  Once you start ridding yourself of those thoughts, you  are thinking positively, while also creating a positive attitude.  The  market has its ups and downs.  Your trading will have the same.  Loses  are inevitable.  They happen to everyone.

Think and visualize yourself as already being a successful trader.   Imagine that your trading experience allows you to easily notice changes  in the market and react to them by making profitable trades.  Imagine  only positive results.  Imagine the wealth you've created and the  lifestyle it affords you.  This type of thinking will help reinforce the  ideas that first led you to the currency market and motivate you to  stick with it.

Another easy method to assist you in becoming a positive thinker is  to surround yourself with a positive environment.  This can be your work  space or the people around you.  The world is filled with doubters and  people who want to "help" you by destroying your dreams or shooting you  out of the sky.  Make it easier on YOU by surrounding yourself with  other positive thinkers who reassure and support your Forex trading.   And liven up your trading space so it's inviting and makes you want to  be there. Maybe it's time to replace this crusty keyboard?

Also help yourself by being a positive talker to others and about  youself.  Speaking positively fills your head with positive thoughts and  ideas.  Negative self-talk only helps to hinder your potential as a  trader and keeps you from growing.

Do your best to welcome the currency market's obstacles and view them  as your opportunities for profits and success.  Dealing with these  obstacles will only help you to create a better trading experience.   Small changes in the way you think about yourself, think about others  and think about trading will go a long way in your overall success as a  trader.

Hi Traderlarry

If I earn 2000.- $ then I have to capitalize my account ten times as much and not the other way round of RRR from 2:1 or 3:1 which you could read everywhere at broker sponsored Forex Literature & articles. For my trading style with my personality and my RR and MM it's useful to manage a reward-to-risk-ratio (which aren't set in stone) from 1:10 and not from 2:1 or 3:1 Why? Because I make much money more in this way, ...the only reason, heavy-duty!

...and PhAnTi's arguments  (see #1436, please) has losen ones objectivity completely.

He said "he doesnt play with SL"

Here I can only reply I don't play with SL I don't trade with SL, if so then only spare.

So I can only argue against once more: I don't play, I trade.

Second blackball: "His DD is impressive".

Drawdowns are per definition: "A drawdown is the reduction of one's capital after a series of losing trades". (http://www.babypips.com/school/drawd...-drawdown.html).

More precisely: There are two types of drawdown that are considered to be the important properties of expert advisors (for instance, in MetaTrader platform) — absolute drawdown and maximal drawdown.

Absolute drawdown is the difference between the initial deposit and the minimal point below the deposit level during all test period. It tells you how big your loss can become compared to the initial deposit during the trading. If this value was 0 during the test, then your deposit wasn’t at risk at all.

Maximal drawdown is the maximal difference between the local maximum extremum in your equity chart and the next local minimum extremum in your equity chart. It tells you how low your strategy can go after getting some profit. It can also be called a depth of a losing streak.

Excursus - in view of EA's aspects.

Generally it’s a good idea not to trade with EAs with the maximal drawdown higher than the profit. But I don’t recommend trading even with strategies or expert advisors that have maximal drawdown at levels higher than 25% of the net profit. Mind your own risk-to-reward ratio and don’t trade with EAs that don’t comply with it.

En passant

Unfortunately, the current version of MetaTrader 4 (Build 225), the strategy tester incorrectly calculates the drawdowns, so if you are testing your EAs, it’s better to calculate both the absolute drawdown and the maximum drawdown manually.

In my way of advanced trading style I prefere the equity and a drawdown is for me more  the difference between the balance of my account, and net balance of my account. The net balance takes into account open trades that are currency in profit, or currently in loss. If you account net balance is lower than your account balance, this is called drawdown.

Drawdowns are part of trading. The key to being a successful trader is coming up with trading plan that enables you to withstand these periods of large losses. And part of your trading plan is having risk management rules in place.

PhAnTi' describes my drawdowns as "impressive". I don't think so. I like to trade the currency pairs logical (less emotional). I like to think in theory of probability (likelihood) and in mathematical aspects during my trading sessions with regard at my risk- and money management and my TCT-concept. At my advanced level trading I don't think so that my "drawdowns" are impressive, due to the fact that I have another risk reward ratio concept of 1:10. (Extreme Example, see #1462, please). At my real accounts there aren't any problems precisely because you can remargin anytime which you can't at demo accounts. In the final analysis does that mean that the profit at the real accounts are still higher and that the most part of Forex Traders Accounts seems to be extremely undercapitalized.

Hope it clarifies things much more!

Kindest regards

FXcube

Risk/Reward Ratio

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg
What Does Risk/Reward Ratio Mean?

A  ratio used by many investors to compare the expected returns of an  investment to the amount of risk undertaken to capture these returns.  This ratio is calculated mathematically by dividing the amount of profit  the trader expects to have made when the position is closed (i.e. the  reward) by the amount he or she stands to lose if price moves  in the unexpected direction (i.e. the risk).

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg
Investopedia explains Risk/Reward Ratio

Let's  say a trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ Company at $20 and places a  stop-loss order at $15 to ensure that her losses will not exceed $500.  Let's also assume that this trader believes that the price of XYZ will  reach $30 in the next few months. In this case, the trader is willing to  risk $5 per share to make an expected return of $10 per share  after closing her position. Since the trader stands to make double the  amount that she has risked, she would be said to have a 2:1 risk/reward  ratio on that particular trade. The optimal risk/reward ratio differs  widely among trading strategies. Some trial and error is usually  required to determine which ratio is best for a given trading strategy.

Reward-to-Risk Ratio

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...or/falling.png  Another way you can increase your chances of profitability is to  trade when you have the potential to make 3 times more than you are  risking. If you give yourself a 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio, you have a  significantly greater chance of ending up profitable in the long run.

Take a look at this chart as an example:

10 Trades     Loss     Win           1     $1,000                 2           $3,000           3     $1,000                 4           $3,000           5     $1,000                 6           $3,000           7     $1,000                 8           $3,000           9     $1,000                 10           $3,000           Total     $5,000     $15,000        In this example, you can see that even if you only won 50% of your  trades, you would still make a profit of $10,000. Just remember that  whenever you trade with a good risk to reward ratio, your chances of  being profitable are much greater even if you have a lower win  percentage.
BUT...
And this is a big one, like Jennifer Lopez's behind... setting large  reward-to-risk ratio comes at a price. On the very surface, the concept  of putting a high reward-to-risk ratio sounds good, but think about how  it applies in actual trade scenarios.

Let's say you are a scalper and you only wish to risk 3 pips. Using a  3:1 reward to risk ratio, this means you need to get 9 pips. Right off  the bat, the odds are against you because you have to pay the spread.
http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/d...&cb=5708aa2b7d

If your broker offered a 2 pip spread on EUR/USD, you'll have to gain 11  pips instead, forcing you to take a difficult 4:1 reward to risk ratio.  Considering the exchange rate of EUR/USD could move 3 pips up and down  within a few seconds, you would be stopped out faster than you can say  "Uncle!"  If you were to reduce your position size, then you could widen your  stop to maintain your desired reward/risk ratio. Now, if you increased  the pips you wanted to risk to 50, you would need to gain 153 pips. By  doing this, you are able to bring your reward-to-risk ratio somewhere  nearer to your desired 3:1. Not so bad anymore, right?

In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren't set in stone. They  must be adjusted depending on the time frame, market environment, and  your entry/exit points.  A position trade could have a reward-to-risk  ratio as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.

Drawdown and Maximum Drawdown

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...er-coaster.png

So we know that money management will make us money in the long run,  but now we'd like to show you the other side of things. What would  happen if you didn't use money management rules?

Consider this example:

Let's say you have a $100,000 and you lose $50,000. What percentage of your account have you lost?

The answer is 50%.

Simple enough.

This is what traders call a drawdown.

A drawdown is the reduction of one's capital after a series of losing  trades. This is normally calculated by getting the difference between a  relative peak in equity capital minus a relative trough. Traders  normally note this down as a percentage of their trading account.

http://www.babypips.com/school/image...-to-trough.png
Losing Streak

http://www.babypips.com/school/images/junior/sos.png

In trading, we are always looking for an edge. That is the whole  reason why traders develop systems. A trading system that is 70%  profitable sounds like a very good edge to have. But just because your  trading system is 70% profitable, does that mean for every 100 trades  you make, you will win 7 out of every 10?

Not necessarily! How do you know which 70 out of those 100 trades will be winners?

The answer is that you don't. You could lose the first 30 trades in a  row and win the remaining 70. That would still give you a 70%  profitable system, but you have to ask yourself, "Would you still be in  the game if you lost 30 trades in a row?"

This is why money management is so important. No matter what system  you use, you will eventually have a losing streak. Even professional  poker players who make their living through poker go through horrible  losing streaks, and yet they still end up profitable.

The reason is that the good poker players practice money management  because they know that they will not win every tournament they play.  Instead, they only risk a small percentage of their total bankroll so  that they can survive those losing streaks.

This is what you must do as a trader. Drawdowns are part of trading.  The key to being a successful trader is coming up with trading plan that  enables you to withstand these periods of large losses. And part of  your trading plan is having risk management rules in place.

Only risk a small percentage of your "trading bankroll" so that you  can survive your losing streaks. Remember that if you practice strict  money management rules, you will become the casino and in the long run,  "you will always win."

In the real world, reward-to-risk ratios aren't set in stone. They  must  be adjusted depending on the time frame, market environment, and  your  entry/exit points.  A position trade could have a reward-to-risk  ratio  as high as 10:1 while a scalper could go for as little as 0.7:1.

&

Trading without Stop Loss  could demand a reward-to-risk-ratio around 1:10.

A risk-reward Ratio from 1:10 sound horrible if you read this at first.

If I think about that it seems for me more a realistical expectation.

Why?

If I make per day 5'000.-$ with a stable drawdown around 90'000.-$ then this drawdown is capitalized by over 50% after 9 trading days.

It's simple and profitable.

If I try to think more technically then the Risk-Reward-Ratio of 1:10 or 10:1 is for me only a question of perception. Then perception could be like this.

In                              psychology and the                              cognitive sciences,                             perception is the process of attaining                              awareness or understanding of                              sensory  information. It is                              a task far more complex than was imagined in the                              1950s and 1960s, when it was proclaimed that                              building perceiving machines would take about a                              decade, but, needless to say, that is still very far                              from reality. The word perception comes from                              the Latin perception-, percepio, , meaning                              "receiving, collecting, action of taking possession,                              apprehension with the mind or senses."

When presented with multiple ways to perceive things, it is our choice  of which we accept.  Below is a very common perception test:

http://img.sparknotes.com/101s/psych....face.vase.jpg

What  do you see?  Is there a vase, or two faces?  The answer is both.  Which  of the two options you see first is based on your perception of the  image.

Edwin Garrigues Boring (October 23, 1886-July 1, 1968) was an experimental psychologist who later became one of the first historians of psychology.

Life

From 1924 to 1949 Boring was director of the psychological laboratory at Harvard University, where his goal became to free psychology from its status as a subsection of the Department of Philosophy. Boring was successful and established an independent Department of Psychology in 1934. He emphasized the use of the experimental method to investigate psychological questions rather than the tools of philosophy.[1]

Among his studies on visual perception, Boring gave prominence to the ambiguous illusion depicting either a young woman or an old woman, which has often been referred to as the Boring Figure after the researcher.

He was president of the American Psychological Association in 1928.[2]

Young woman or an old woman?

Hi Gregory!

Yes of course, so you have to wait till the EMA-Lines crosses. I go often earlier in the market and hedge if orders are going further on in the counterpart direction. Concerning the Pivotal I'm in the market just now, and take the higher risk over.

Yes you're absolutely right!

Many thanks for the clarification.

Forex Trading & Sandboxes

Do they really have some common features?

Sandboxes  fascinate me. You can live in a concrete jungle yet right there in the  middle of city smog, metal swing sets and wooden benches is a box  containing sand imported from Rightly, who knows where?

Watching children at play in those sandboxes is especially delightful.  The sound of their giggles, the way they work so intently to build their  castles or other castle-like architecture with such greag focus they  don't see or hear what's going on around them. Adorable. Not so adorable  when you consider that as we Perfect into entrepreneurs, many of us  treat our business as However we were still playiny in the sandbox.

The sandbox feels safe. The boundaries or safe zones are clearly  identified by the four corners that make up the box itself. You can  bring tools with you when you enter the sandbox but once you're in, you  pretty much stick to playing with what you've got. There is no question  that you can have a successfful business in the safe zone. However, to  create wild success you've got to stop building sand castles and begin  building your empire!

Here are four steps (there are more!) to get you out of the safe zone and into the Wild Success Zone:

1. Know what you want.

Nothing is greater than having clarity of purpose - the reason you jump  Lacking of bed each morning anxious for Which  the day brings. As a  child you were asked, what do you want to be when you grow up? Now  that you're all grown up (well, not entirely I hope) ask yourself,- what  do I Inadequacy the rest of my life to stand for? Your personal brand,  business systems and overall structure are designed around the answer  to this quetsion.

2. Be clear on your motives.

I recently read that entrepreneurship is all about being of service and I  couldn't agree more. An entrepreneur has the Chance; fit to sniff out  what a market needs and/or wants, then creates a solution to satisfy  that need/want. If the solution does in fact satisfy the need (and  assuming a strong brand and promotion is in place), you're on your way  to hitting a home run. Do you ever feel like you're spinning your wheels  in your Trade? You might be stuck in the safe zone creating services  or products that you think your market wants. Your intention comes from  the right place but Whether you are truly going to serve others, you  must be clear on their needs first.

3. Shake it off.

There is a time and place for sticking with the tried and true. If you  want to achieve wild success, you must be willing to step out of the  safe zone and shake off what no longer serves you. As an entrepreneur,  you put your heart and soul into your business. After all, for many  small business entrepreneurs, you are your business. Just as the seasons  change, each year brings new insights, revelations and growth  opportunities. The persons' alliances and methods that once served you  may have changed seasons. Are you changing with it or are you getting in  the way of your own success?

4. Do it afraid!

Moving out off your comfort zone isn't easy. Frankly, only a select few  have the courage to step out of that sandbox. Is it scary? You bet! Is  it gratifying? Absolutely! What I've learned about fear is this: fear is  an emotion, a Sensation that you either let control you or you control  it. The Election to build more than sand castles is completely yours.  There are myriad of tools and resources to help you conquer the  Apprehend and play bigger than you thought possible. As secure as the  safe zone is, the wild Prosperity zone is so much better. Come on step  inside!

If you make a Multiple-Time-Frame Analyse often you have the same as described at #1471  as a Boring Figure (young woman or an old woman), isn't it?

To make a multiple time frame analyse more effective you have to do the job in the right way how to filter out the relevant data. That's as well as the case may be a question of perception.

See the Example below, please.

If you make 5'000.-$ a Day (with a 250'000.- $ Account) you have to capitalize your Negativ-Saldo (neg. RRR) after 10 Trading Days.

Mind Games – The Psychology of Forex Market Trading

When  it comes to trading on the Forex market, winning is a matter of the  mind rather than mind over matter. Any trader who’s been in the game for  any length of time will tell you that psychology has a lot to do with  both your own performance on the trading floor and with the way that the  market is moving. Playing a winning hand depends on knowing your own  mind – and understanding the way that psychology moves the market.

Studying the psychology of the market is nothing new. It doesn’t take  a genius to understand that any arena that rides and falls on decisions  made by people is going to be heavily influenced by the minds of  people. Few people take into account all the various levels of mind  games that motivate the market, though. If you keep your eye on the way  that psychology influences others – including the mass psychology of the  people that use the currency on a daily basis – but neglect to know  what moves you, you’re going to end up hurting your own position. The  best Forex coaches will tell you that before you can really become a  successful trader, you have to know yourself and the triggers that  influence you. Knowing those will help you overcome them or use them.  Are you saying ‘Huh?” about now? Believe me, I understand. I felt the  same way the first time that someone tried to explain how the mind games  we play with ourselves influence the trades and decisions that we make.  Let me break it down into more manageable pieces for you.

Anything involving winning or losing large sums of money becomes emotionally charged.

All right. You’ve heard that playing the market is a mathematical  game. Plug in the right numbers, make the right calculations and you’ll  come out ahead. So why is it that so many traders end up on the losing  end of the market? After all, everyone has access to the same numbers,  the same data, the same info – if it’s math, there’s only one right  answer, right?

The answer lies in interpretation. The numbers don’t lie, but your  mind does. Your hopes and fears can make you see things that just aren’t  there. When you invest in a currency, you’re investing more than just  money – you make an emotional investment. Being ‘right’ becomes  important. Being ‘wrong’ doesn’t just cost you money when you let  yourself be ruled by your emotions – it costs you pride. Why else would  you let a loser ride in the hope that it will bounce back? It’s that  little thing inside your head that says, “I KNOW I’m right on this,  dammit!”

Bottom line: You can’t keep emotions out of the picture, but you can learn not to let them control your decisions.

To most people, being right is more important than making money.

Here’s the deal. The way to make real money in the forex market is to  cut your losses short and let your winners ride. In order to do that,  you have GOT to accept that some of your trades are going to lose, cut  them loose and move on to another trade. You’ve got to accept that  picking a loser is NOT an indication of your self-worth, it’s not a  reflection on who you are. It’s simply a loss, and the best way to deal  with it is to stop losing money by moving on – and really move on.  Moving on means you don’t keep a running total of how many losses you’ve  had – that’s the way to paralyze yourself.  This brings us to the next  point:

Losing traders see loss as failure. Winning traders see loss as learning.

Not too long ago, my twelve year old son told me that before Thomas  Edison invented a working light bulb, he invented 100 light bulbs that  didn’t work. But he didn’t give up – because he knew that creating a  source of light from electricity was possible. He believed in his  overall theory – so when one design didn’t work, he simply knew that  he’d eliminated one possibility. Keep eliminating possibilities long  enough, and you’ll eventually find the possibility that works.

Winning traders see loss in the same way. They haven’t failed –  they’ve learned something new about the way that they and the market  work.

Winning traders can look at the big picture while playing in the small arena.

Suppose I told you that last year, I made 75 trades that lost money,  and 25 that made money. In the eyes of most people, that would make me a  pretty poor trader. I’m wrong 75% of the time. But what if I told you  that my average loss was $1000, but my average profit on a winning trade  was $10,000? That means that I lost $75,000 on trades – but I made  $250,000, making my overall profit $175,000.  It’s a pretty clear  numbers game – but how do you keep on trading when you’re losing in  trade after trade? Simple – just remember that one trade does not make  or break a trader. Focus on the trade at hand, follow the triggers that  you’ve set up – but define yourself by what really matters – the overall  record.

Hi Gregory-1991

I apologize that I don't make the name of my brokers public.

What I would recommend is EURUSD down long term around 1.37/1.40, Target: 1.25 this year & a Long Term Carry Trade GBPTRY Sell ~2.565, Target: 2.345. Temporary trades? "Ger30mar11" are given a great desin at H1/H4 Level with CCI(14) Tops & Bottoms and supplementary with divergence trading here. Last one you can find at the Broker Activtrades http://www.activtrades.co.uk/index.aspx.

Be aware that I don't trade without any stop loss, so it's absolutely equal for me if the price would run in the counterpart direction for a time. My trading concept allows me the waiting pending acceptance.

A Hidden Bullish Divergence might forces your decision for some enter longs ;-/

Hidden bullish divergence happens when price is making a higher low (HL), but the oscillator is showing a lower low (LL).

This can be seen when the pair is in an uptrend. Once price makes a  higher low, look and see if the oscillator does the same. If it doesn't  and makes a lower low, then we've got some hidden divergence in our  hands.

H1 & H4 make further out a strong case for trading it (see #1502, please).

Taking into consideration that Forex market spends up to 50% time in  non-trending, sideways state, the knowledge of how to deal with  range-bound markets becomes vital.

What is the simplest thing we know about the range-bound market?

...Its beginning is difficult to spot. Quite often by the time we  realize that the market is ranging we’ve already made few errors and  paid for it.

We'll use the main rule: if the market is not trending, always treat it as a ranging market.

Yeap thats what i do. Besides, either way is fine by me, as long as they keep volume below 90/min, above that and im biting my nails, not able to reach the keyboard.

Tuesdays have a strange rangyness to it, it looks to me like people are hawks on price at tuesdays, waiting for someone to do something so they can join in, more then usual on tuesdays. I think tuesdays has become the new monday, people dont trade much on mondays and instead do their main thing on tuesday, i think thats why it screws a bit with my calculations.

By the way id like to pick your brain on economy of the world in general, the euro, the dollar what you think about world leaders going around talking about the end of the dollar and a one world currency. Will Germany eventually be fed up with dragging the heavy load of southern european countries debt? What is the view of the public in Zurich on the euro, will it survive?

Hi Yaed

I apologize, I'm not the man for exchange views. It needs too much time, for discussing around the right crystall ball. I trade in my own reality which is here and now. I know there are a lot of intelligent economical conversations like WEF.

I think generally that the market could be depend this year at more uncontrollable events done by assassinations, national deficits and one or two abrupt FX Market crashes & political upheavals like Egypt presently, (as a consequence the higher oil prices over hundreds of pips at one day),... like a premonition of what was to come. (So may be an EURUSD 1.40 - 1.15/0.95).

In finance, volatility most frequently refers to the standard deviation of the continuously compounded returns of a financial instrument  within a specific time horizon. It is common for discussions to talk  about the volatility of a security's price, even while it is the  returns' volatility that is being measured. It is used to quantify the risk  of the financial instrument over the specified time period. Volatility  is normally expressed in annualized terms, and it may either be an  absolute number ($5) or a fraction of the mean (5%).

5 Steps For Trading In Forex Market Volatility

By Richard Lee

An  increase in market volatility often leads traders to find a  lot more trading  opportunities. The huge market usually swings lots of  potential for gain, but also for  loss, especially if traders do not  take the necessary precautions.

During times  of volatility, traders need to adjust their strategy to compensate for erratic  market. The FX Markets  also provides a great section on their site showing traders which  currency  pairs are experiencing the most and least volatility that day.

1.  Decrease in Leverage

During  times of extreme volatility, losses may seem traumatic. With  the average daily  pip movement increased in volatile times, traders  should be considering how  their leverage will affect their trades. At  a  one percent or even a half percent margin, investors should be mindful  of how  much leverage, or even the size position being traded, can  affect their  portfolio.

In normal market  conditions, placing a 2 lot position is fine when  you are looking to make about  50-100 pips. During a more  volatile  time, when the potential loss is 100-200 pips, it stops being an   effective risk to reward ratio. To compensate, traders should look to  taking on  smaller trading positions, in this case only one lot as  opposed to the average  2 lot position.

2.  Use Tighter Stops

Many  traders are hesitant to use tighter stops in volatile markets  because they see  the large swings increases the likelihood that the  position will be taken  out. Having tighter stops can also provide great  risk managers in times of  extreme volatility. For example,  on a  EUR/USD trade, rather than setting an 80 pip stop to protect your  position,  consider placing a 50-60 pip stop. This  will insure the  protection of your currency position and if the stop is broken,  there  is a higher likelihood that the trend will continue lower and the stop  took  you out before you could potentially lose more money.

The width of the stop  being set does depend on the currency pair  being traded, as some pairs have  wider ranges. In a Yen cross  like the  GBP/JPY or AUD/JPY, traders may be more likely to have wider stops as   their average daily range is 50% more than that of the EUR/USD.  With  that said, stops during volatile market  conditions should not be as  wide as before. Instead of a stop of 100 pips below entry,  traders may  consider a 25 pip reduction and have a 75 pip stop.

Below is a  chart showing the EUR/USD and the GBP/JPY on the same  very volatile day in the  forex market. The EUR/USD had an impressive  range of nearly 600 pips! The GBP/JPY  far dominated though with nearly a  2000 pip trading range.

3.  Be Selective with Trades

In  volatile market conditions, traders are often tempted to place an  increase in  trades as the market is going wild and they want to take  advantage of all the  trading opportunities. It is important to remember  that in volatile times,  losses are likely to be big. Before placing a  trade, assess risk  tolerance levels. How much risk is acceptable for  the trader both  psychologically and financially? It may  be a good idea  for a trader to shift their interest somewhere else until  things  settle down, instead of trading  a violent pair.

4.  Increase Discipline When Trading

During  all market conditions, traders should follow their  predetermined trading  strategy. During volatile market conditions, it  is important to use that same  level of restraint and self discipline.  Any  set stops, contingency plans or risk management benchmarks must be  adhered to  without hesitation. This  will help in defining how much  risk is taken and should price action be  uncontrollable.

5. Know Before You Go

It also helps a trader to know what is causing the current  spate of  volatility in the markets in order to be prepared for the  unexpected.   As such, an investor can  accommodate their strategy to the market  environment and not just the currency  pair being traded.  The first of  these  considerations is accounting for emotions in a market: is fear  currently  driving the market lower?  Or is it  buyer's mania that is  keeping the bullish tone alive?  Traders' overreaction and emotion tend  to  push markets to overextended targets.   This fact alone creates  volatility through simple supply and demand.

Volatility can also, and more than likely will, be sparked  by  economic events.  In this instance,  market participants may interpret  fundamental data differently and not as cut  and dry as the more novice  trader.  A  perfect example of this is usually monthly manufacturing  reports that are  released in pretty much all industrial economies.

The classic scenario has the market honed in  on a particular number  for the month.   However, traders young and old will sometimes wonder  why the market sold  off if manufacturing showed positive growth.   The  answer is simple.  The market  had a different interpretation and  positions were violently reshaped and  shifted.  These tend to create  great  opportunities for some and horrible memories for others. Below is  an hourly  chart of the EUR/USD during ISM Manufacturing for October 1,  2008. Here we can  see the huge price gap that occurred due to market  volatility as well as the  resulting trend.

http://images.tradingmarkets.com/200...o/1105Lee2.jpg

Panic and erratic momentum can additionally be found in  certain  market environments.  Not to be  confused with fear or greed, panic  selling and buying can create very choppy  and relatively untraceable  markets.   These conditions will lead some to flip flop their positions  while  leaving others gaping at the fact that the position was right,  only to be  stopped out prematurely.  These two  common examples will  create further panic and volatility as traders abandon  their own  individual strategy for the possibility of instant profits or  stoppage  revenge.  As a result, a vicious  cycle of volatility ensues until a  definitive market direction can be  established.

The simple rules above, and a task of getting to know the  current  trading environment, can empower every trader through the ranks.   Although some relate volatility with  difficult and untouchable markets,  opportunities continue to remain abound in  these less than attractive  conditions to those focused and fortunate.

By following these five simple steps, trading in volatile  market  conditions should be a little simpler. Remember to adjust leverage based   on volatility, stick to how much risk your trading plan already  determines, use  tight stops and don't jump into every trade that looks  good.

Forex Volatility Indicators

Volatility Indicators show the size and the magnitude of price fluctuations.

In any market there are periods of high volatility (high intensity) and low volatility (low intensity).

These periods come in waves: low volatility is replaced by increasing  volatility, while after a period of high volatility there comes a period  of low volatility and so on.

Volatility indicators measure the intensity of price fluctuations, providing an insight into the market activity level.

Volatility Indicators:
Average True Range (ATR)
Bollinger Bands (BB)

Bollinger Bands Width

Chaikin Volatility (CHV)

The methodology of using Volatility indicators

Low volatility suggest a very little interest in the price, but at  the same time it reminds that the market is resting before a new large  move

Low volatility periods are used to set up the breakout trades. For  example, when the bands of the Bollinger bands indicator squeeze tight,  Forex traders anticipate an explosive breakout way outside the bands  limit.

A rule of thumb is: a change in volatility leads to a change in price.

Another thing to remember about volatility is that while a low  volatility can hold for an extended period of time, high volatility is  not that durable and often disappears much sooner.

Yes i understand your view. Now on the note of volatility, as you posted some info in that just now and as we are seeing a lot of that right now i am wondering if you know any website that tries to make predictions of volatility/volume based on scheduled news and things like that? To me there is no real difference between volatility and volume, and i really need a way of at least giving me some indication of what volumes to expect during the day.

On another note i asked you a while ago if you used specific levels for CCI, watching if anything significant happens at these times. You told me you hadnt delved into that specifically. On that note i want to tell you that i use CCI 20, typical price with such levels at 190 and -190. Applied to E/U M1. So heres what it means to me: Beyond/above those levels price is strongly bought/sold, thats the basic interpretation. But thats not all: If this level is surpassed fast, often in one candle, then the re-entry is a key moment, the 190 is a decent reason to sell, the -190 is a decent reason to buy. Now i would not enter a trade based only on that, but watch it and you can see there is at least something to it. As you and i well know, you need more reasons then one to enter a trade, but it is a guideline i use as well as envelopes, moving averages, S/R and stochastic.

By the way i sometimes enter a trade, it goes well and i close it and afterwards i realise it was a CCI divergence, and then i think of you.

Anyway happy pipping meanwhile and ill check back with you in a while.

P.S. I see brent crude has just touched 102 USD, oh how the yankies will whine and dine over their "expensive" gasoline, here its about 2 USD/litre (13+SEK) because of our high taxes on gas.

Taking Advantage Of Central Bank Interventions

by Richard Lee (Contact Author | Biography)

It seems that every country's central bank   these days is involved in some sort of capital control over their   currency. Set aside from standard monetary and fiscal strategies, these   policies are used to keep domestic denominations under control while   keeping a country's growth stable. One of the most frequented strategies   used by policy makers is direct market intervention. Japan's central bank has used the strategy on more than one occasion. By printing Japanese yen   to sell, and buying back U.S. dollars, the Bank of Japan is  controlling  the value of its exchange rate against the American  currency. (To learn  more, see The U.S. Dollar And The Yen: An Interesting Partnership.)

But that's not the only method that is being used, and the Bank of Japan is certainly not the only one intervening in the FX market. So let's take a look at some other capital control strategies that are being used by global central banks and how to take advantage of such an opportunity.

Korea's Intervention

South Korea, with an export  economy similar to Japan's, is a country that has also been known to  intervene in the foreign exchange markets directly in order to control  the rise and fall of its currency, the South Korean won (KRW). But things have changed, and South Korea's  central bank is looking for additional means of control. An alternative  to applying direct intervention in the markets, government officials  and the Bank of Korea are beginning to audit banks and larger  institutions handling currency market transactions.

Aimed at curbing speculation, the regulations tighten requirements on the country's banks trading in large currency derivatives, potentially punishing those that are unprofessionally or improperly transacting in the market.

Aiding in the reduction of currency speculation, the strategy  increases government scrutiny over market positioning and would support  higher requirements on currency positions for foreign currency  speculators. All in all, the measure looks to gradually reduce interest  in the South Korean won as it becomes more costly to trade currency in  the country.

Another way to curb interest and speculation in a country's currency is through higher foreign investment taxes.

Brazil's Tax Change

The Brazilian government implemented measures in order to curb its own currency's speculation – aside from directly selling Brazilian reals and buying U.S. dollars. One such measure is to increase the foreign tax rate on fixed income (or bond) investments.  The tax rate would affect foreign investors attempting to take  advantage of a stronger BRL/USD exchange rate through large purchases of  Brazilian bond investments. Originally at 2%, the tax rate increased to  6% as of October 2010.

Increasing the country's foreign tax rate is going to make  transacting in Brazil more costly for speculators in banks and larger financial institutions  abroad – supporting a disinterest in the Brazilian currency and  decreasing the amount of "hot money" flowing into the Brazilian economy.  (To learn more, see The New World Of Emerging Market Currencies.)

Using Central Bank Interventions to Your Advantage

Global  central banks sometimes refer to strategies and tools that are already  at their disposal. We all know that market speculation accelerates when  central banks raise interest rates.  During these times, investors look to capture any yield difference  between their own currencies and higher yielding currencies. But, in  times of massive market speculation, central banks may be forced to  actually cut interest rates – hoping to deter any speculation on higher interest rates.

Central banks lowering interest rates are hoping to narrow the yield  differential with other economies – making it less attractive for  currency speculators attempting to take advantage of a wider yield  difference. But, how can one take advantage of these opportunities?

It's simple. Although central banks apply capital  controls on their domestic currencies, these policies tend to do little  damage to the overall trend. In the short term, the announcement will  temporarily shock markets. But, in the long run, the market ultimately  reverts back to its original path. (Learn more in Interest Rates Matter For Forex Traders.)

An Example of How to Profit

Announcements of  intervention offer great opportunities to initiate positions in the same  direction as the recent trend. Let's take a look at the direct  intervention efforts of the Bank of Japan on September 15, 2010.

In Figure 1, the USD/JPY exchange rate was moving lower since May  2010 on massive currency speculation. It was during this time that  traders bought Japanese yen and sold U.S. dollars on the news that China  was investing  in Japanese bonds. The momentum helped the Japanese yen appreciate  against the U.S. dollar from an exchange rate of about 95 per U.S.  dollar to 84 in a matter of three months.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank1.gif                               Figure 1

As a result of the yen's quick appreciation, the Bank of Japan  decided to intervene for the first time in six years. At 84, the USD/JPY  exchange rate was becoming too much for exporters to handle. The  stronger yen was making Japanese products uncompetitive overseas. The  announcement caused the USD/JPY currency pair to jump almost 300 pips overnight. In Figure 2, we can see the effects of intervention on our daily chart.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank2.gif                               Figure 2

Now, this is where it gets interesting. The intervention efforts by the Bank of Japan drove the currency to  test projected resistance (red line) dating back to the currency's  short-term top in May. Zooming in (Figure 3), we can see that the next  two days produced two dojis  just below support at 86.00 (red line). Dojis signify that momentum in  the market following the intervention is exhausted – a sign of  resistance failure.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank3.gif                               Figure 3

Attempting to enter into the current bearish trend, we place a short  entry at 85.50. This is just enough to confirm a breakdown in the  short-term price action while remaining just below the 86.00 support. A  corresponding stop is placed about 100-125 pips above our entry price -  just enough to keep us in the position.

As expected, the overall bearish USD/JPY market trend continued with  the pair dropping to support 80.25 before retracing a bit. This makes  the USD/JPY short trade profitable by a maximum of 525 pips –  maintaining a risk to reward ratio of almost five to one.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...ntralBank4.gif                               Figure 4
Bottom Line

With increased  speculation in the market, central banks will continue to apply capital  controls in order to control their currency's exchange rates. These  present great opportunities for retail investors  and traders to seize entries into longer-term trends – as intervention  scenarios rarely work for the policy makers.

Hi yead

Here're some Basics

Volume is volume of trades. In  exchange-based markets, discrete information about the quantity of  trades over delta t is available. In forex, however, one relies on price  ticks per delta t.

Momentum is rather subjective. In my case, I view momentum as how the  bullish moves compare to the bearish moves. If one side is bigger than  the other, the momentum is "heavier" towards one side.

Volatility is a measure of price displacement over delta t. I guess you  can also call it speed, as volatility does not tell you exactly where  price is going or if it is even going anywhere, for that matter. ATR is a  good measure of volatility and you'll notice that it changes throughout  the day as sessions begin and end.

You can google all these by yourself. I'm not your secretary!

e.g.

google search: "volume volatility forex" (287'000 results 0.22 sec.)

I won't waste time on it!

Think outside the Box

Stop  bothering me with the concepts of "2% stop loss" or the   "reward-to-risk-ratio". I can't understand it! I have a bias towards   other statistical parameters.

<Non-Stop-Loss-Concept>

See also p.20, #293; p.44,  #652 ;

I have my own beliefs in intellectual property rights and the laws which  govern the distribution of such, and will act accordingly. I will not  try and convince anyone of my stance.

The  most part of my trades are without any stop  loss. I don't like to  trade with crutches but with the addition of negative on balance!

Financial orientation - raw data

Try  to capitalize the bonanzas with 1:10, say if I make a daily profit  around 15'000.-$ so the minus input has to capitalize with 150'000.-$  (another example see, #1552) & the rest might be hedged.

Financial orientation - raw data

So often you could see open orders between -50'000.- and -180'000.-$ (negative on balance) at the account:
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Fore...000--day/77119

Financial orientation - raw data

The ratio "Open Trades" to "History" should be around 1:9. (The "History" shouldn't contain any loss orders)

Instruction:

1. Step -Target: Double (triple, quadruple) your money and withdraw all negative open orders above at the finish.

2. Step: Close the account at the finish & open a new account & make the same procedure as before.

3.  Step: Try to guide 7-15 accounts per year net into plus (net value: 700  x 1500%), say if 3 should completely wrecked, handle 10-18. (Maximum  open accounts almost of the same time: by a factor of 2 to 5).

Patience to Gain Knowledge through Study and Focus

Many new traders believe all you  need to profitably trade foreign currencies are charts, technical  indicators and a small bankroll. Most of them blow up (lose all their  money) within a few weeks or months; some are initially successful and  it takes as long as a year before they blow up. A tiny minority with  good money management skills, patience, and a market niche go on to be  successful traders. Armed with charts, technical indicators, and a small  bankroll, the chance of succeeding is probably 500 to 1.

To increase your chances of  success to near certainty requires knowledge; acquiring knowledge takes  hard work, study, dedication and focus. Compile your knowledge base  without taking any shortcuts, thereby assuring a solid foundation to  build upon.

See #1547

Think outside the Box

Financial orientation - raw data

Try  to capitalize the bonanzas (daily win, daily profit) with 1:10, say if I make a daily profit   around 9'000.-$ (Example 9'757.33$) so the minus input has to capitalize with 90'000.-$ (Example -77'734.22$)   & the rest might be hedged.

It's beneficial by compensate the -77'734.22$ with the "Equity" or "Free Margin" variable.

So it's not necessary to think in aspects of drawdowns (may be 2% or 5% and close then your losses). No!, ...no!, ...no! Really the wrong way for my understanding of profit taking! Your daily profit is only a flipside, a reverse, a drawback of the risky trades of your losses, say the other side of a stastistical parameter of your probability calculation,...a fortiori (as much more) as 90% of all "2%-achievable-loss-trades" might be running in a win sooner or later, so you have to concentrate exclusively of the negligible quantity by 10%, say if you have 50 open trades you have to manage only 5 "more dangerous" trades a little longer. Think a little about it and make up your mind without indoctrinate me.

Paradox Or Not?

Paradox is such a great looking word that I couldn’t resist it. I  must be a little odd or should I say weird but I just love the X at the  end and the way it sounds. Just don’t get me going about paradoxical! So  what is a paradox?

A paradox is a statement that contradicts itself. It is so much  easier to give an example rather than a load of words. A classic is ” I  always lie” if it is true then it must be false and is therefore a  paradox. Also, which came first, the chicken

http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...ll-234x300.jpg

Waterfall Paradox

or the egg?  Space, time and the universe are full of paradoxes and just go to show how weird the place that we live in is.

It has been said that there are no true paradoxes, only apparent  ones. It is certainly the case that many paradoxes come about when  language is badly applied to experience. These paradoxes show that our  language must be looked at more carefully. Finding the “resolution” of a  paradox means finding a way of talking about it so that it’s  paradoxical nature vanishes.

Here are a few paradoxes that I found particularly interesting.

Can Things Be Impossible For A God?

These paradoxes illustrate problems with omnipotence. Can God create  an object too heavy for him to lift? Or, forgeting the physical problems  entirely, can God ask a question too difficult for him to answer? And  was that the question?

This paradox treads on theological grounds, which brings in special  problems of heresy and damnation. Either God cannot in fact  do everything, or he can, but he chooses not to thus avoiding the  problem.

Lets Make 2=5 Well Perhaps

Here is an example of a paradoxical mathematical proof. Several such  proofs exist but all contain faults. The first line is taken as a given: A = B A+A = A+B (adding A to both sides) 2A = A+B (simplifying) 2A-2B = A+B-2B (subtracting 2B from both sides) 2A-2B = A-B (simplifying) 2(A-B) = 1(A-B) (factoring) 2 = 1 (cancelling)  Once it is established that 2=1, it is easy to prove that any other  pair of numbers are equal simply by multiplying and adding appropriate  numbers to both sides of the equation.’

http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...re-Paradox.jpg

Square Paradox

Proofs’ like this always have a fallacy. The fallacy in this one is  in the last step, when the (A-B) on both sides is cancelled. This is  division by zero, which is illegal in mathematics. That’s a pity isn’t  it I could have been a rich and famous man.

Zeno’s Paradoxes
Zeno’s  most popular paradox runs something like this, suppose you want to  cross the room, first you have to walk halfway across, then you have to  cross half the remaining distance, then half the remaining distance, and  so on. There are, eventually an infinite  number of distances you have to cross to get across the room, and this  is impossible to do in a finite time, therefore, all motion is  impossible.

The resolution of this paradox does not require calculus, It is only  necessary to point out that Zeno has assumed that the distance across  the room is infinitely divisible, but not infinitely extended. Therefore  the time required to cross it must also be infinitely divisible, and it  is not required that the time be infinitely extended. Whether space or  time are actually infinitely divisible may be a problem in modern  physics, but that’s way over Poor old Zeno’s head.

The Lying Cretin

This and the following several paradoxes rely on headache inducing phenomenon known as self-reference. The Lying Cretin, like Zeno’s Paradoxes, comes to us from the Ancient Greeks. One version of the Lying Cretin paradox occurs in the Bible-

“One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans  are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true. Titus  1:12-13″

http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...x--283x300.jpg

Starbucks paradox

The prophet in question was Epimenides, who said “all Cretins are  liars” when he was being interrogated by Athenians. The problem here is  that if what he says is true, then he, a Cretin, is always a liar, so  what he says is therefore false. There must, in fact, be at least one  Cretin who is not a liar. This is not quite a paradox, it is just an odd  way to lie. The writer’s claim that “this witness is true”, cannot be  correct. Lying Cretans: 1 – the Apostle Paul: 0.

The Barber Paradox

In a certain town lives a barber who has a peculiar rule by which he  operates. The barber cuts the hair of everyone who doesn’t cut their own  hair, and he doesn’t cut the hair of anyone who does cut their own  hair. Who cuts the barber’s hair?

The resolution to this is that the barber is bald (Or he uses hair remover). Alternately, no barber can follow such a rule.

The Librarian Paradox

This one is a little tricky to follow; there is a chief librarian who  is in charge of several libraries. He asks the librarians of each  library to prepare for him, in book form, a catalogue of all of the  books in their respective libraries. Each librarian is faced with a  dilemma. Since the catalogue is a book, should it be included in the  catalogue of books? Some decide yes, some decide no. When the chief  librarian receives all of the catalogues, he divides them into two  groups, those which list themselves, and those which don’t. There are  many of each kind, and the chief librarian sets out to catalogue the  catalogues.

He prepares one catalogue which lists all catalogues which list  themselves. Another lists all catalogues which do not list themselves.  Where is this last catalogue to be listed? If it does not list itself,  then it really should, but if it does, then it really shouldn’t.

The resolution is simple; the librarian cannot make a catalogue according to the stated rule.

Newcomb’s Paradox

You are taking part in an experiment. In front of you on a table are  two boxes, box A and box B. Box A is made of glass so you can see  inside, and it contains £1000. Box B is opaque and contains either  nothing or £1,000,000. You are

http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...gn-300x180.jpg

Paradox Sign

allowed to take either box B alone, or both box A and box B.

Here’s the catch, the people running the experiment claim to be able  to predict with astounding accuracy which of the two options you will go  for, and will have put the £1,000,000 in box B only if they predict  that you will only take box B. If they think you will take both then  they’ve left box B empty.

In the previous thousand experiments like this, their predictions  about what the subject will do have been correct… so, what do you do?  No, don’t run away.

One argument is that you’re just another subject, so if you take both  boxes you get £1000, if you take just box B then you get £1,000,000. So  take just box B.

On the other hand, either the money is sitting there in box B or it’s  not, so whatever is in box B, taking both means you get £1,000 more  than if you take just box B.

which box would you take?

Fermi’s Paradox

This Is a Very Well Known and common Paradox around the Internet and amongst alien conspiracists and organisations like SETI.

Fermi realized that any civilization with a little  rocket technology  and a small amount of expansion ambition could rapidly colonize the  entire Galaxy. Within ten million years, every star system could be  colonised. Ten million years may sound long, but in fact it’s quite  short compared with the age of the Galaxy, which is roughly ten thousand  million years. This doesn’t seem to have happened.

Fermi’s paradox asks,  where are they?

Drake’s equation shows that the galaxy should be colonised and makes  us ask Fermi’s question once again. The equation is usually written:

N = R* • fp • ne • fl • fi • fc • L

Don’t let all those symbols confuse you, Drake’s equation is just a  lot of different factors to do with the number of alien civilisations  and the different things that would affect them multiplied together.  These “things” are listed below. N = The number of civilisations in The Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable. R* =The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life. fp = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems. ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life. fl = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears. fi = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges. fc = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space. L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.  So Drake’s equation says there should be loads of aliens and Fermi’s paradox says well where are they Mr Drake??

Olber’s Paradox

Why is the night sky dark? The universe is rather big, well, we could   call it infinite which means, we will say, that there are infinite   stars. All those stars and all that light produced by those stars should   fill up the night sky with light. But It doesn’t, does it?

http://www.weirdwarp.com/wp-content/...oe-300x219.jpg

3d Tic Tac Toe

This paradox has been around a long time and a few explanations have occurred. De Chesaux and Lord Kelvin   (who gave his name to the temperature scale) suggested that there  might  be dust in between us and many of the stars, blocking out the  light  that we receive from them. However, absorbing dust would  eventually  cause an equilibrium, and emit as much radiation as it  absorbed. Even if  it was at a different wavelength, we would still  receive the same  amount of light as before.

Some astronomers thought that if the universe was expanding (as good   old Hubble showed that it is) light from distant stars could be   redshifted by the Doppler effect. While this effect provides a   contribution, it doesn’t account for enough light to darken the entire   sky, the left overs should still be detectable.

Benoit Mandelbrot   suggested that there is fractal distribution of galaxies. This would   mean that there was a lot of empty spaces between stars, and galaxies,   so the light coming from each direction would not add up to infinity.

The real explanation to Ober’s paradox   is that light takes time to travel and therefore it hasn’t reached us   yet and by the time all the light does reach us, the stars will have   died and others will have been born so the light can never make the   nights day.

EPR Paradox And Schrodinger Cat

I have covered these both before in a quantum physics post.

The EPR Paradox is a paradox  that was first suggested by Einstein who  proposed a thought experiment  that appeared to demonstrate quantum  mechanics to be an incomplete  theory.

Grandfather Paradox

Although a bit morbid, it demonstrates an interesting conundrum. If   you had access to a time machine, what would happen if you traveled back   in time and (let’s hope) accidentally killed Grandpa? What would  happen  to you? Your parents? Your kids?

Bilking Paradox

This violates causality all over the place, it is  an assertion of free  will which transcends the functionality of time  travel. It is best  explained by example, a man builds a time machine  from plans he  received from a mysterious person years before. The man  realizes that  the stranger was himself, using the time machine to travel  back and  give the plans to his younger self.

A bilking paradox would occur if the man built the machine, tested its reliability, and then refused to give himself the plans.

Interesting and mind bending, paradoxes keep us thinking. From Catch-22http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t...2&a=0099477319 “a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind”.

In this novel, this meant that an airman might be crazy and could be   grounded, all he had to do was ask. But if he did ask, he was deemed   sane and so had to keep flying. He might be crazy to fly more missions,   and sane if he didn’t – but if he was sane, he had to fly them. I  expect  this will not be airmen one day but spacemen.

3. Have you done some statistics about the winning percentage of the TCT? And Could you please share it for us? :-)

Hi hotjoey

I think in terms of probabilities, in likelihoods at most of my time when I make up a mind about the selection of currency-pairs (1st step).  CCI(14) filtered out the best ones clearly, fast & effectively. CCI(14) gives a fast optical orientation when I will make the time-consuming currency MTF analyzes in the sequel.

I-Fractals has been only used for an optical support (when the charts  are published) in hindsight. It could be that it repaint the things at  the chart. I wouldn't to attach too much importance on it. You can use  just as well "Insert" >  "Channels" > "Standard Deviation" in combination with the CCI(14) in order to obtain more powerful arguments for your trade decision.

If I would explain now the impact of chaos theory in combination with the probability theory, the CCI(14) & MM's I think I need a day for explaining it in detail. It can't be possible that you will lodge this claim.

You could often see such a typicall market situation at smaller timeframes (here M30) if at higher charts (daily, weekly, monthly) could the market develop a breakout.

May be we'll see that the market price could struggling around with little ups and little downs before will turning in a bigger trend (up or down). We don't know!

I'll trade with TCT some longs up (long term) and short downs (short term) in the meantime before a bigger trend at the higher timeframes will shape.

Forex Trading - Standard Deviation a Powerful Tool For Bigger Profits

By Sacha Tarkovsky

In Forex trading most new traders don't understand the concept of standard deviation. However if you understand it, you can gain greater insight into price movement and a huge edge in your quest for profits.Let's look at standard deviation in greater detail.

Standard deviation may seem a bit confusing at first, but it's totally logical.

Let's do the technical bit first and then look at why it is so important at the end of this article.

What is it?

Standard  deviation is a statistical term that provides an indication of the  volatility of any price and that includes forex prices. It measures how widely values (closing prices) are dispersed from the average. Dispersion is the difference between the actual value (closing price) and the average value (mean closing price). The  larger the difference between the closing prices and the average price,  the higher the standard deviation will be and therefore the volatility  of the market. The closer the closing prices are to the average  mean price, the lower the standard deviation and the volatility of the  currency is. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance, the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

High Standard Deviation values occur when the data item being analyzed is changing dramatically. On the other hand, low Standard Deviation values occur when prices are more stable. Major tops and bottoms are accompanied by high volatility as investors reflect the psychology of euphoria, greed and fear.

Why it is so useful?

All  short term price spikes in financial markets that move to far from the  mean price are unsustainable and are a reflection of human psychology.

The emotions of greed and fear are at work and eventually prices will move back toward the mean.

Keep this equation in mind:

Supply and demand fundamentals + investor psychology = Price movement.

A big rise in volatility away from the mean is a spike normally driven by emotion.

If  you can spot this you have a tool to take profits if you are trading in  the direction of the move or make a great contrary trade against the  volatility.

How to apply standard deviation easily.

If you understand standard deviation you can use it to your advantage.

A great way is to incorporate Bollinger bands in your trading and we will look at them in more detail in next article.

--- 帖子 #1587 ---
http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...deviation.html

Standard Deviation measures volatility  statistically. It shows the difference of the values from the average  one. The volatility as well as the standard deviation gets higher if the  closing prices and average closing prices differ considerably. If the  difference is insignificant the standard deviation and the volatility  are low.

The reversals of trends such as bottoms or tops of the market are  timed by high volatility levels. The new trends of prices growth after  some recessive period are sometimes timed by low volatility levels.

The square root taken from the variance which is the average from  mean squared deviations forms the Standard Deviation calculation.

The considerable change of the data under analysis, such as indicator  or prices, gives High Standard Deviation values. Stable prices form low  Standard Deviation values accordingly.

The most considerable tops are thought to go along with the  significant volatility that occurs due to processes of fear and euphoria  of investors. Considerable lows don't give much profit expectations,  that's why they generally pass calmer.

Topics related to Standard Deviation:  Standard Deviation Channel Standard Error Standard Error Bands Standard Error Channel

--- 帖子 #1588 ---
http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...n-channel.html

Two lines which are parallel to the Linear Regression Trendline correspond the Standard Deviation Channel. Their distance from LTR are x standard deviations.

Prices movement from tops to bottoms is objective. New highs are  created when the optimism of the market participants increases. New lows  become the result of the market participants' pessimism accordingly.

Markets are supposed to have the pricing point being equilibrium. The Standard Deviation Channel gives the sign of extremes falling in the same way as Linear Regression Trendline shows an equilibrium point.

The position of the point on the graph which is one standard  deviation above and below the LRT falls in 67% cases according to  statistics. Two standard deviations increase gives the 95% possibility  for the data do decrease between these lines.

--- 帖子 #1589 ---
http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...ard-error.html

The distance between the price of a security and Linear Regression Trendline gives the basis to measure Standard Error.  The trend is as strong, as close the price is to the Linear Regression  Trendline. The higher the distance is, the weaker and less reliable  trend is due to the high standard error.

High price volatility is indicated by high values of Standard Error. Trend modification is followed by an immediate standard error growth.

The combination of this indicator and the R-Squared is widely used.  R-Squared decrease along with Standard Error generally forecast trend  changes. The unusual values trending to a converging are the sign of  change.

Still a downward movement from the top is not the only direction of  the trend change as far as sideways fluctuations are supposed to be the  change either.

--- 帖子 #1590 ---
http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...ror-bands.html

The basis of Standard Error Bands is standard error  levels located higher or lower than Linear Regression Indicator.  Standard Error Bands developed by Jon Anderson are the variation of  envelope. That's why their outlook is close to Bollinger Bands though  their calculation differs. The plotting of Bollinger Bands is made a  standard deviation higher or lower than a moving average, whether the  lines drawn below or above linear regression plot are Standard Error  Bands.

The recommendations of Andersen are following values: the number of  periods is "21", smoothing at a 3-day simple moving average, standard  errors: "2". Another note is that unreliable results are made by taking  short time frames.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...derr-bands.png

Standard Error of the security gives the ground for Standard Error Bands  spacing. That's why the reliable trend can be seen when the distance  between the bands is very tight. Wide fluctuations and price volatility  is expected when the distance is big. The increasing distance after  being small is the sign of the trend losing its strength and a possible  reversal.

- Strong trend is indicated by tight bands.

- Wide distance between prices gives the freedom for prices fluctuations.

- Increasing distance between bands can be the sign of trend weakening and possible reversal.

- Prices follow the direction of the bands reversed after the lost trend.

- Standard Error Bands makes a good combination with the r-squared  indicator. A reliable trend existence is confirmed by high r-squared  value along with low bands' distance. A combination of low r-squared  value and wide bands' distance shows the trend weakening.

Generally speaking, the trend and its volatility are attempted to be  shown by Standard Error Bands. This indicator gets resulted in 3 plots.  The linear regression line showing the 21-period ending value is the  middle one.

Two standard errors added to the regression line's ending value result in the upper standard error band (the upper plot).

The subtraction of two standard errors from the linear regression  line's end value creates the lower standard error band (the lower plot).  Closing price may greatly influence the line values as well as error  bands. That's why it's necessary to draw the three bar (period) simple  moving average of the ending value of the regression line and the  standard errors.

Standard Error Bands have much in common with Bollinger bands, though  their interpretation differs. Trend directions along with its  volatility are represented by Standard Error Bands whether the  indication of Bollinger bands is average plotted price volatility.

One of the usage tactics of Standard Error Bands is monitoring the  distance reduction at the moment of both upward and downward price  movements. An easy price trend is supposed to occur in case this  situation takes place. A strong trend keeps the bands at the close  distance. The Linear Regression follows the increasing or decreasing  trend direction. The price reduction is indicated by widening Bands. A  trend completion may be signalized by the following Linear Regression  decrease.

Standard Deviation - Why it's So Important for Forex Traders

Standard deviation is a concept all Forex traders should  understand as part of their Forex education. In fact if you don’t  understand it and know how to factor it into your trading strategy you  are unlikely to win long term. Let’s look at it. Standard deviation is logical, easy to understand and will help you  time entries better and define targets for trades, as well as spotting  important trend reversals.

It’s a simple and powerful concept and all forex traders should know how it works and how to take advantage of it.

The real problem that traders have to overcome when trading forex is  overcoming volatile price moves that can stop them out to soon or with  losses – if you learn how to deal with standard deviation, you will  enter with better risk reward and get stopped out less often.

What is standard deviation?

Standard deviation is a statistical term that refers to and shows the  volatility of price in any currency. In essence standard deviation  measures how widely values are dispersed from the mean or average.

Dispersion is effectively the difference between the actual closing value price and the average value or mean closing price.

The larger the difference between the closing prices from the average  price, the higher the standard deviation and volatility of the currency  is. On the other hand - the closer the closing prices are to the  average mean price, the lower the standard deviation or volatility of  the currency is.

Technical Calculation

Here is the technical bit don’t worry if you find it a little  complicated we will simplify things in a minute – here is the  calculation:

Standard deviation the square root of the variance, and the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

High Standard Deviation is present when the price of the currency  studied is changing volatile and has large daily ranges. On the other  hand, low Standard Deviation values take places when currencies are  range trading or in consolidation i.e. when prices are more stable and  less volatile.

Spotting Big Contrary trades

Major tops and bottoms and important trend changes are accompanied by  high volatility as prices reflect the psychology of the participants  and greed and fear push prices away from the fundamentals.

If you look at any forex chart you will see price spikes caused by  human emotion and they are not sustainable and prices tend to return to  more realistic levels after periods of high volatility – you will often  here the term blow off top or bottom where prices make one last volatile  surge and reverse.

3 Important Ways to Use Standard Deviation

So how can you incorporate standard deviation in your forex trading? The answer is it is useful for:

1. Picking important market tops or bottoms i.e look for highly volatile prices that have spiked to far from the mean.

2. Targeting entries within trends - if for example, prices spike  away from the mean to far, they will fall back to the average  eventually. If the trend is strong you can target entry at the mean  price.

3. If prices are trading in a narrow range and suddenly high standard  deviation pushes prices away from the mean, you can trade with the  break.

If you want an easy tool to apply to help you apply standard  deviation in your trading - looking no further than the Bollinger band.  Most major chart services plot it and its easy to use – we don’t have  time to explain it all here so see our other articles.

The Real Enemy for Traders

Is not picking trend direction, it’s entering with the best risk  reward and dealing with volatility if you have understanding of standard  deviation you will be able to deal with the enemy of volatility,  harness and control it, and use it to achieve currency trading success.

Hi yaed

It's a great idea, but I don't think that some traders will give you the respect without due care for it.

I have sent you a PM.

Another great idea could be that several traders are open a private real account (everyone for himself) with a small deposit (so hackers shouldn't be interested in it) and publish the results at myfxbook.com.

Otherwise you can count me in there, please.

Hi Gregory

Really nice charts!

Keep up the good work!

The market price could go further up till 1.6870 since weekly CCI(14) isn't exactly at it's top. If so I'll trigger several M15 longs in the meantime.

I wish you success & happiness!

Best regards

FXcube

Welcome to John Bollinger's technical analysis and Bollinger Bands Forex website!

Bollinger Bands are a technical trading tool created by  John Bollinger in the early 1980s. They arose from the need for  adaptive trading bands and the observation that volatility was dynamic,  not static as was widely believed at the time.

The purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of  high and low. By definition prices are high at the upper band and low at  the lower band. This definition can aid in rigorous pattern recognition  and is useful in comparing price action to the action of indicators to  arrive at systematic trading decisions.

Over the past two decades, thousands of traders using technical analysis  have come to view Bollinger Bands as a most reliable tool for assessing  expected price action. Forex traders have been using Bollinger Bands  for years, but this is the only website dedicated to providing Bollinger  Band analytics for the forex market.

For in depth understanding of Bollinger Bands and to get the most from  this website we recommend you read John Bollinger's book "Bollinger on Bollinger Bands"

Basic Patterns

This section will cover some basic candlestick patterns, but first you should become familiar with some basic candlestick terms.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...c-patterns.gif

A long candle is a very long body when compared to other most recent candles.

A short candle is of course, just the opposite and usually indicates  consolidation. It occurs when trading was confined to a narrow range  during the period.   The term white bodies refer to periods of extreme buying pressure.

Black bodies refer to just the opposite, period of extreme selling pressures.

Long Days Pattern

Candlesticks in a long days pattern are shorter than  the actual body. They indicate the large differences between the price  at the time the market opened for the day and the price at which is  closed.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...long-days1.gif
http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...long-days2.gif

--- 帖子 #1615 ---

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...-patterns.html

Short Days Pattern

Candlesticks in short day patterns will be short  lines within a  short body. These lines represent the minimal changes  between prices  at the time the market opened for the day and the price  at closing.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...hort-days1.gif
http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...hort-days2.gif

Marubozu Pattern

A  Marubozu pattern indicates that there are no shadows present in the bodies.

A White Marubozu is represented by a long white body that doesn't   contain any shadows. It's usually the first indication of a bullish   trend, but can indicate the trend will continue or reverse.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...e-marubozu.gif

A Black Marubozu is represented with a long black body and generally   indicates a bearish continuation period or reversal pattern.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...k-marubozu.gif

--- 帖子 #1616 ---

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...-patterns.html

Spinning Tops Pattern

When the shadows are longer than the body itself, it's referred to as a Spinning Tops pattern.    In this type of market pattern, the color of the body isn't actually    important. The pattern is an indication that there is a lot of    indecision between the bearish and bullish market trends.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ning-tops1.gif
http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ning-tops2.gif

Stars and Rain Drops Patterns, along with reversal patterns are some of the more complicated patterns in the market.

A Star pattern forms whenever a small body peaks above the long body of the previous market day.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ticks/star.gif

A Rain Drop pattern depicts a drop; it appears when small bodies fall just below the lowest peaks on the long body of the previous day.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag.../rain-drop.gif

--- 帖子 #1617 ---
http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...-patterns.html

Continuation Patterns

In the candlestick theory, there are two main patterns that are continuous, the Falling Three Methods and the Rising Three Methods.
Falling Three Methods

A long black black day will occur in a downward trend and be followed  by three days of small real bodies that create a short upward trend.  However, by the fifth day, the bears will step in rather strongly and  cause the market to close at a new low rate. This small upward trend  that occurs between two long black days reflects the consistent behavior  of the investors taking a small break. This downward trend will usually  continue for a time. It denotes a bearish trend and has a high rate of  reliability.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ee-methods.gif

1) The first day will be a long black day.

2) The second, third, and fourth days that follow will have small  real bodies. The rates will remain within the range of the beginning day  and will follow a brief period of an upward trend.

3) The fifth day is a long black day. When the market closes on this  day, it will close at rates that  are below the rates the market closed  with on the first day.

Rising Three Methods

During an upward trend, a long white day will occur that is followed  with three days in which small real bodies have fallen into a short  downward trend. Again, this trend is indicative of the investors taking a  small break. At the close of the fifth day, the market will close at a  new high rate,  this results when because the bulls have came in strong.   This method also indicates a bullish trend and has a high reliability  rate.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ee-methods.gif

1) The first day will be a long white day.

2) The second, third, and fourth days that follow small real bodies.  The rates reflect a brief downward trend, but still remain within the  range that the market had on the first day.

3) The fifth day is a long white day. At closing time on this day,  the market will have rates that are above those on the first day of  closing.

Reversal Patterns

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...tterns-01.html

There are also several types of reversal candlestick patterns within Forex trading, as defined below. Dark Cloud Cover Engulfing Evening Star Harami Morning Star Doji Piercing Line Three Black Crows Three White Soldiers  Dark Cloud Cover Pattern

During an upward trend in the market gaps will begin to open, but  they are not stable and will lose ground falling below the midpoint of  the market the previous day. This pattern indicates the opportunity for  investors to capitalize at the opening of the market the next day. This  is actually a warning sign for bullish investors. This candlestick  pattern is the exact opposite of the Piercing Line pattern. This pattern  indicates a bullish trend and has a high reliability rate.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...loud-cover.gif A white body followed by a black body. The black body passes the midpoint of the prior white body. This candlestick pattern occurs in an uptrend.  Engulfing Pattern

This pattern occurs when a candle body of the days market completely  engulfs the body of the previous day. There are also several engulfing  patterns, white engulfing candles are bullish, black engulfing candles  are bearish. A bullish engulfing commonly occurs when there are short term bottoms and a bearish engulfing  will occur when the market is at the top. Many of the other  candlesticks, such as Dojis, Hammers and Hanging Man, require the  confirmation that a trend change has occurred that follows an engulfing  pattern.  This pattern indicates a bullish trend and has a high  reliability rate.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag.../engulfing.gif

When engulfing occurs in a downward trend, it indicates that the the  trend has lost momentum and bullish investors may be getting stronger.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...-engulfing.gif The first day's color indicates the trend of the trading day. The second real body should have the opposite color of the first real body. The second day's body should completely engulf the previous day's body.   When engulfing occurs during an upward trend, it  indicates the market will open with a new high. This high will be  followed by a high volume of sell-offs, that result in the day closing  at or below that of the previous days opening. This indicates that the  upward trend has suffered and became weak and the bearish investors may  be gaining some strength in the market. This pattern indicates a bullish  trend, but has only a moderate rate of reliability..

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...-engulfing.gif The first day's color indicates the trend of the trading day. The second real body should have the opposite color of the first real body. The second day's body should completely engulf the previous day's body.

http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...tterns-01.html

Single Candle Patterns

There are some types of single candle patterns in candlesticks' theory. They are the following:  Dragonfly Doji Gravestone Doji Hammers/ Hanging Man Hollow Red Candles Filled Black Candles  Doji's

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...ticks/doji.gif
Doji's are reversal candlesticks that are formed  when the market opens and closes at the same level. This pattern  indicates there is a lot of indecision in the prices of stock. Depending  on how long the shadows are and where they're located, Doji's can be  divided into different formations such as Doji, long legged Doji,  butterfly, gravestone and the 4 price Doji.

Doji's become more significant to the market when they appear after  and extended period of long bodied candles, whether they are bullish or  bearish and is confirmed with an engulfing. They follow a bullish trend  and only have a moderate rate of reliability.
Long-legged Doji

A long legged Doji candlestick forms when the stocks  open and close prices remain the same. This Doji is much more powerful  if it is preceded by small candles. It indicates a sudden burst of  popularity in a stock that previously hasn't been very popular, thus can  imply the beginning of a change in trend.
Dragonfly Doji

Dragonfly Doji's are Doji's that opened high in the  market, experienced a notable decline, but received enough support to  close at the same price at which it opened. They are often seen after  there has been a moderate decline and when they are confirmed with a  bullish engulfing, they are indicators of a bottom reversal.  Dragonfly  Doji's indicate a bullish trend that offers moderate reliability.

The Dragonfly Doji has a higher reliability rate associated with it than the Hammer does. The long lower shadow is about two to three times the size of the real body. There is very little upper shadow, or none at all. The real body is at the upper end of the trading range. The color of the real body is not important.  Gravestone Doji

Gravestone Doji's are the opposite of the Dragonfly  Doji and when confirmed with a bearish engulfing, are the top indicators  for a reversal. Appropriately named, they look like gravestone's and  could forecast doom for the stock. When the stock opens and closes at  the same level after Forex trading, it's referred to as 4 price Doji's.  This very rarely occurs and is generally only evident with securities  that are thinly traded. This is a bullish trend that provides investors  with moderate reliability.

http://www.forexrealm.com/forex-imag...stone-dogi.gif Small real body at the upper end of the trading range. Upper shadow usually at least three times as long as the real body. Very little lower shadow or none at all.

Whipsaw

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg
What Does Whipsaw Mean?

A  condition where a security's price heads in one direction, but then is  followed quickly by a movement in the opposite direction. The origins of  term is derived from the push and pull action used by lumberjacks to  cut wood with a type of saw with the same name.

http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg
Investopedia explains Whipsaw

There  are two types of whipsaw patterns. The first involves an  upward movement in the share price, which is then followed by a  drastic downward move, which causes the share's price to fall relative  to its original position. The second type involves the share price to  drop for a little while, and then suddenly, the price abruptly  surges towards positive gains relative to the stock's original position.

Whipsaws and Fake-outs

Some of the most frustrating  and costly market phenomena a trader is likely to see are whipsaws and  fake-outs. Actually these are pretty much the same thing, with the  difference that calling it a fake-out attributes a negative intention to  the market, essentially accusing it of messing with your head. And a  whipsaw or fake-out can indeed have a serious impact on your confidence  in yourself and your trading system. If you spend your days looking for  price break-outs and trends and instead you get a string of these nasty  up-and-down spikes, you may wonder why you got into trading in the first  place. The past couple weeks have been a vivid case-study in whipsaws  and fake-outs, which is why they seemed like a good topic for today.

So  what is a whipsaw/fake-out, exactly? It's a point in the market where  the price moves dramatically up or down, and in the early stages may  look identical to the start of a new trend. Then, instead of continuing  the trend or leveling off, it'll suddenly dive back down (or up, in the  case of a downward spike) to a price close to where it started. If  you've watched forex charts for any length of time, they've almost  certainly crossed your path. But if you're new to the currency markets,  or aren't sure exactly how to spot one, here are a couple from the past  week's EUR/USD market.

http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_...own-717104.JPG
http://www.forexforays.com/uploaded_...own-753234.JPGWhat  causes them? Well, almost by definition they are points when there is  insufficient momentum in a particular direction to sustain a trend.  Because market sentiment is ambivalent, divided fairly evenly between  longs and shorts, the price is unable to continue its break-out and  falls back to where it started. If you've placed your limit/take-profit  orders at an optimistic price point in anticipation of a strong trend,  you're likely to find the whipsaw comes nowhere near them and lands you  back within a few pips of your entry price, and a few pips poorer thanks  to spread costs.

The most dangerous whipsaws include price  spikes in both directions, which after convincing you to place a trade  in the direction of the first spike, then turn around and take out your  stop-losses with the second spike.

If we broaden the definition a little bit, stop-hunting  could be considered a type of whipsaw that's staged by a broker within  their own trading platform with the specific goal of hitting their  clients' stop-loss orders. If you see a whipsaw on your broker's charts  but not on anyone else's, chances are you got stop-hunted.

That's not to say you can't make money on a garden-variety whipsaw or fake-out; I have no idea if it's possible  during stop-hunting. If you're good at identifying markets in which  they're likely to emerge (like the current one), you can adjust your  trading strategy accordingly by placing your limit orders at levels  closer to the entry price than you would in a trending market. You might  also try combining these more modest limit orders with a tight trailing  stop to help prevent all your profits evaporating when the price  suddenly changes direction.

Or, if you're like me and find  whipsaws and fake-outs too nervewracking, unpredictable, and costly to  play with, you can work on filtering them out of your trading by  avoiding market conditions when they occur. In my experience these tend  to be in range-bound markets with low volatility and little notable  economic news to fuel a true break-out. I'm sure someone out there is  getting rich off these things, but it's definitely not me!Labels: Errors, Risks, Whipsaws

What is the best time of day to trade the EURO/USD

by admin on September 30, 2010

Q: What is the best time of day to trade the EURO/USD, and,  are there other currency pairs best trading hours somewhat the same as  the EURO/USD?

A: This all really depends on you. Do you want to trade UK, European  & U.S.A Sessions? Or do you just want to trade UK or USA Trading  sessions? Each session lasts approximately the same. Generally trading  opens when the stock market opens in the US, but trading in the UK  Starts at approximately 3AM EST (8AM GMT). European Sessions open 1 hour  later, at 9AM GMT and close One Hour later after UK Session. UK closes  around 5PM GMT. Some days earlier by an hour or two.

Which hours / sessions do I trade? Well, to be honest, when ever I’m  at the PC, some days I try to trade the UK Session as this session seems  to be the fastest session out both the UK & US Session.

As some of you may know, my hours are all messed up! Welcome to the world of trading Forex…lol

I’ll find myself awake at 2am ready to trade the UK Session, and I may  trade all the way through or at least keep my eyes peeled on previous  trades that were open for a day or so, all the way into the late  evening. Then you might find me saying “Hello, Morning all” on Skype, at  4pm cos I’ve just woke up…lol

Now as in which currency pair is my preferred pair to trade?

Well, what’s good for the Gander is not necessarily good for the Goose.

However, I do recommend for the time being to just concentrate on the  EUR/USD as this tends to move slower than GBP/USD and faster than  USD/JPY and a fair amount of pips can be made on the EUR/USD and a  perfect pair to practice on to get in early on a trade. Once you master  how to get into the EUR/USD at the right time, you can be looking at  around 120-200 pips for that day!

This takes time to master. I’m finding that my Students get in at the  right time, make a nice amount, ie, 40-60 pips, but jump out too soon.  But hey, one has to learn to crawl before one walks, right? When you  feel you want to spend less time analyzing the markets, practice on  finding those longer pip gains. Set your take profits and stop losses  appropriately, and sit back and let it rip!

Study any reactions in the market, why, if at any time, your stop  loss was triggered. Was it because you didn’t take all the aspects of  Technical Analysis into consideration? Or did you set your Stop Loss too  close to the opening price.

Personally, I set my Stop losses to around 150 pips. This will cater  for any fundamental news that can cause a Whip-Saw / Spike, a whip-saw  is a huge move the other way of the general anticipation of it’s current  direction your trade is going in; down or up.

You can also try practicing using the Trailing stop too. I’d set this  quite high, to around 650-750 points, which is equivalent to 65-75  pips. Once your trade is in profit by this amount, the stop loss will be  raised for AUTOMATICALLY! So even if the trade did come down by approx  30 pips and hit your stop loss, there’s no worries cos it’s already  booked in those 65-75 pips. http://forexcourse.ultimategoldencro...icon_smile.gif

Moving on. Have you noticed the AUD/USD? This is one of my favorite pairs…

Why?

Well, spend a day or so, just flipping back to your trading chart  windows with the Aussie Dollar in action. Don’t worry about trading it.  Just watch it. Watch as the EUR/USD & GBP/USD goes up, yup, the  AUD/USD goes up with it, but this is not what I’m asking. Notice  something?

If you did notice this, then well done! Notice how the GBP/USD and  EUR/USD goes up, or goes down and the AUD/USD follows it, but how  there’s less sporadicity going on. When the AUD/USD goes up or goes  down, it keeps going in that direction with hardly any pull back /  retracement like you will see with other major currency pairs. It’s also  a slow mover too, but once it goes in that direction by say, 50 pips  from a previous low, or a previous high on its way back down… LOOK OUT!  This puppy can pull in those dollars big time! http://forexcourse.ultimategoldencro...icon_smile.gif

I hope this helps.

All the best

Forexcube, i'm interested in knowing more about your trade management plan. Could you explain further details or point me in direction of some literature that might have influenced you?

--- 帖子 #1630 ---
Hi marx85

I don't have read excellent money management books since today and I have read many of these but no one of these could reflect my kind of trading in a realistical way. What a pity? May be I will write a MM/RM Book once time for advanced level traders.

Money Management

Formula: Capitalize-the-risk-ratio

A daily  profit about +30'183.30$ needs a capitalize-to-risk-ratio around 1:10  without any kind of stop loss trading, instead of the  risk-to-reward-ratio of 3:1 or 2:1 or so by trading the 2% stop loss  rule. So I have to manage the "equity" or the "free margin"  position around 300'000.-$ in plus (10 times more then the daily win).  My personality and my trading concept (say all the corpus rationale of  my fx-experience) allows to make a risk definition over the daily win  positions. May be it sounds stupid in one form or another, for me it's an intelligent cognition, simple, efficient & profitable.

It's very hard to use any form of Position Size Calculator (like http://www.earnforex.com/position-size-calculator),  that lets you to calculate the size of the position in units and lots  to accurately manage your risks, albeit it works with all major currency  pairs and crosses & even though it requires the minimum input  values, but allows you to tune it finely to your specific needs. I have  predominantly to realign at the 1:10 ratio, due to the fact that I  overcharge the trades in scalping times, where I generate some parts of  my daily win from short-term trades as well as you know during  longer-term trades are running on. I don't make comments which of these  open trades (usually 10% by comparing with all closes trades at the History file) are short dated, medium term or long range or  currency-cross-pairs, hedging pairs or so. A global formula is that I  use smaller lot sizes at long-term pairs and high lotsizes at  short-termed currency pairs. It depends a lot of times which probability  factor I could match a trade. E.g. if Daily, H4, H1 are signaled a  trend I tend to go in with a higher lotsize. A Bullish (Bearish)  Counterattack Pattern hasn't for me the same power of argument by  contrast with a Bullish Piercing Pattern (Dark Cloud Cover) or a Bullish  (Bearish) Engulfing Pattern & higher time frames have for me  general more power then PA's at smaller timeframes. I like more to think  in dynamical procedures everything flows, so item the currency market.  Determining the position size is more affected with the likelihood or a   probability factor. When I think the market didn't show a clear trend,  it's ranging I like to hedge some trades or select some overspeed  crossing pairs in the range of smaller lot sizes.

Deficit Management

by trading without any stop loss

I have to hedge (or double, triple, quadruple) the deficit or make with  other currency pairs a counterbalance in money management. It's more a  daily routine to compensate or equate the losses if there are no need of  any stop-loss in the forex landscape. What you need is to develop your  trading skills that you are able to do this if trades are running aginst  you, but it's not a critical factor concerning the determinant of the  daily wins. If the wins have a daily medium weight about 5'000.- you  need only 20 trading days to counterbalance a 100'000.-$ deficit. The  fewest currency traders think about it! Why? ...because they make more  losses then wins, ...contrary it's really easy for an advanced level  trader!

May be you could follow the same procedure with a new opened Demo 25'000.-$ Account here at board the next four weeks in place of the 250'000.-$ Account described as example above.

Kindest regards

FXcube

Thanks for your explanation Forexcube.

As I understand it, your hedging term refers to capital protection by maintaining a higher than 10:1 profit to loss ratio and not to hedge single trades on a loss. Or do you also incorporate the later on your trading?

This concept seems interesting but the floating losses could get bigger than expected if your open orders are to be all in one side of the table.

Example: 3 open shorts and 1 long, and then the market rallies up.

The only way i see you controlling this kind of risk is by offsetting all the open shorts with matching longs, or one could say, hedging the open trades individually.

Please take some more time to educate me.

Thanks again.

Well it seems i have been misunderstood.

I never wanted to criticize your trading style but to comprehend it. The fact that you reacted so severely to some of my affirmations, being accurate or not, proves me that your presence in this forum is to boast your own confidence by showing off with some demo results.

I really wanted to learn more about your trading, but if that's the attitude one gets, i think i'll prefer to stay quiet from now on, and just let you do your thing.

Thanks anyway.

May I say one last thing?

Don't be like that because of a comment of mine.

There are other users who will want to follow your posts.

But i guess to keep doing this or not is entirely up to you.

No harm was meant.

Best wishes.

U FKed that up big time Marx85..Why didnt u just shut yr mouth and watch and liste..U mite have learnt somthing..GEES.. the human being factor stuffs it every time.If u had read the thred u may i say may have understood why he posted demos..

--- 帖子 #1641 ---
I was shut until i asked for some help, yet the answer was not friendly.

My reaction was quick and uncalled for, but as you can see the flow of the conversation has been changed by post editing.

I know that my comeback response was incorrect of me.

And for that i apologize.

--- 帖子 #1642 ---
I would not either post statements of my live trading account, thats just asking for trouble. And i probably would not even post demo statements if i was trading a very specific way and/or very specific settings.

I have a friend hwo is not doing so good on his demos, he get to keep them forever, Alpari never close them. Mine usually are around for about a month and then i cant get access to them for some reason.

A short question that only experience can answer:

To which Time Zone do your set your pivots? In PivotsD indicator one can choose different time zones for daily pivots. Which ones work best? I guess either GMT or EST. Which one would you recommed?

And what time zone is the results of screens? For example the last screen for february 13?

Danke Dir!

Hell Who got to move Time Cell Trading on MultiCharts ??

--- 帖子 #1645 ---
wow just seen this thead for the first time and it looks GOLD.

I gotta lot of reading to do to catch up.

But quick question, the first pages of this thread shows MML they play an important role, and by the end of the thread I no longer see MML in any of the charts.

Has MML been thrown out ?

--- 帖子 #1646 ---
well I have been doing lots of tests on a similar system using MML and I have found similar results in terms of win ratio. I am getting around 70% on the majors. Certain pairs do better than others. And I do have stops ( basically next murrey line or when pattern invalidates )

The reason why I asked my question in the first place is that I found success with one particular MML and not the one being used here. I have found significant differences in performance based on which MML indicator is being used. The difference between 70% and 50% using MML on 4hr time frame is only a few trades.

So I was wandering if the author of this thread has given up on MML ?

--- 帖子 #1647 ---
maybe you get a max of 20 trades per year for each pair

Is there a EA Trading Robot for the Borowski News Trading System available??
