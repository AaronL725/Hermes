Hi trader, I uploaded your indicators, they look good. I would like to test an EA of this and back test it for results. Have you try to get it made yet? thanks

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thank you for sharing your system. I have no doubt it works because of it's similarity to the Vegas 4 hour model, and Dial's Knife system, both of which are very successful. The reason I appreciate your sharing is that it caused me to view the two abovementioned systems in a slightly different light. Your repeated mention of distance between the SMA's reminded me of the way Dial describes how every marble in a bag of a marbles is a potential winner and a potential loser and the probability of which it will be is a function of both selected trade direction and distance between the SMA's. I do have one question though. Are your two SMA's based on the close? I ask because in the Vegas and Knife systems the 55 is based on the median, while the 8 is based on the close. Thanks! Michele UU

Trader, Have you watched the signal indicator when it posts its signals what are the lag times on the bars the arrows show up? Due to fact 4 hour bar charts sometimes can be slower, while the market moves fast at times.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for the interest, I have to tell you that this is a basic and I did not elaborate it so much because I wanted let poeple develop and implement it as they like, this let them be congenial with the method. I will let you know if you have any specific question or need personal help to implement or filter, little by little I will add some additional indicators or templates or discuss examples that explain master entries and money managements. Just keep in mind that:1-We neglect most of the time the bar that bears arrow (signal indicator) 2-when the bar have a very high range (regarding currency pair) be aware because there would be an abnormal reason that it happned, normally there will be a retrace, in such cases enter in/after retracement 3-About the performance in fact we never trust so much to back tests, because the markets always change the behavior and for such shorter time periods any fund can be lost in a medium run, for example try thid method for recent GOLD chart, you see, it is very great, but the behavior of GOLD is complicated and different from forex 4-SMAs are on close, any other setting may differ slightly but the tenets are the same More in near future, Thanks all Ibo

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Ibo, For the benefit of those of us who don't use MT4, can you please explain your trend definitions? How do you define a blue, red or green candle? Please also tell us how you define an arrow point up? Thanks Simon

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I will complete this method in future, I have the plan to add trading tricks with this method almost one time per 2 weeks. Dr Rock! defining a trend in a specific time scale is one the most difficult works in trending markets, if somebody can do this easily he can be a millionaire just in some years. On the other hand reversal trading is better and more profitable, there are differences between trend following method and reversal method. This method is reversal type; in this method you are surier about the entry rather than trend following and the risk-reward ratio is higher too. So you don't need to define the trend you just pinpoint where trend reverse and then enter. Look at open/close prices and the 8SMA and then you can find out how the colors apear. Have a good day Ibo

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Ibo, I can't look at where the colours change because I don't have MT4. I wish to program it into Wealth-Lab developer so I need the definitions that you have used to code it into MT4. Thanks Simon

--- 帖子 #9 ---
MT4 is free, you shoud download from one of broker's site and install it, then copy the indivcators in experts/indicators where you have installed the MT4, then right click on the indicator that you want to know what it do, and choose modify, then you can see the definitions, calculations and functions and whatever you want to encode. Regards, Ibo

eurusdtrader, thanks for your post. still playing with it. it looks like vegas kinda provoked some other people to share their secrets. thanks to all of you, guys. what goes around comes around, right?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
ATTENTION: I will post complementry stuff and tricks that you see will work, this is just a starting and you should take time to discover the aspects, this is why I did not post whole in a time, I appreciate questions and research on method with photos, so dont keep them for yourself and let poeple enjoy your attempts, you will get more feed backs rather than your own works. I added one candle time indicator, you can get it and use for live monitoring and be aware when a 4hr candle will be closed (and you can enter that in your analysis) Happy trading Ibo

Why are there 2 different templates in your file? To me, they look the same. Why two? The difference is that one is with PP, you in some cases will need to use pivot points to see where is the resistances, supports and totally the important levels to put your stops and targets 2. What do you think if I use fibo lines from vegas 4-hour as exit points? Why you almost used the first part of vegas system but removed his idea of taking profits at fibo lines? I think one of the huge benefits of vegas system is that it is much easier to exit without second guessing. What is your concept of exit? Many systems are similar in basics but different in details, Vegas 4hr system is good, but its taking direction from weekly chart is not really so profitable, you will lose many of good opportunities. I mentioned the yellow line is the first target that you may use, targeting/risk management is the most important role in trading, I found this after many defeats in trading even with good methods, as I told this is a starting and I will expand it and will tell you many things with real examples, some of them are about money management during holding positions and where you should put stops/TPs. Please be patient but for the time being use whatever you like (I have told this too) 3. When you are saying (page 1): until candles are above or below the white line… you mean the whole candle or just the close? I will publish about this too in detail, but keep in mind when they are regularly are above white line, this is a good and less violate trend (like recent eurgbp moves) but when they are get far form white line they will retrace and touch that frequently until in one case cross it and reverse, in some cases when we don't have a decent trend you see that they cross the white line in some cases and are not decent, many green candles are so but shortly among prices, CLOSE PRICE is the most important, you should include that in most of your considerations or analysis 4. My always bottleneck is a proper entry and stop/loss. You are saying in PDF file: always trail the price with a good range. Could you please help me to understand what the good range is? I am really having problems with it. If you could give me some numbers for different currencies, I would be completely happy. I understand this is beyond the scope of just the questions about your method. For now, I am thinking 100 pips for GBP/USD, for example, is a good range. Or this is too much? I am getting tired of being stopped out but I do not want to overshoot either. It is not about pips or pairs, it is about corrections and the important major/minor levels that the price during its way come across or build, don't worry I will explain it in advance in future, just easily try to put your stop beyond the highest high/lowest low and trail it not by trailing stop 100 like this: When a correction done update your stop loss, go H1 and you will see it easily, use PP if they are close to these levels 5. What currencies you think are better to use with EJ? It does not matter, back to the history and see which you are relax with this method, when I were a newbie I used to minor trading because they are less violate, majors are more complicated but more profitable too, use pairs that have decent trends, you can think about markets except forex too, just check them out

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Well, I entered a long in the EUR thurs on my own system, and friday the EJ_4H gave a Long arrow, I took profits after 50 PIPS on 3 lots..... Thanks for the indicator, I think it will be a good one. Again, can someone modify the EA-Indicator to send out an EMAIL alert when an ARROR appears? This way when you get the alert YOU can decide to get onto the trade.... thanks

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Ok, eurusdtrader, here is my next set of questions: 1. I applied both templates to several currencies and only EUR/USD shows PPs, support and resistance lines. Is it me again, or I have to turn it somehow on? 2. I can see the time, I guess, to the close of the candle. You did not explain what to do with the time. I think you are planning to do it later, right? The time is not moving, it is stuck on 110 min 38 sec, and again, it is only on EUR/USD. 3. You said that the primary target is the cross with the yellow line (55 SMA). What is a secondary target if I don’t have PP, support and resistance on other charts? The opposite signal or the close of the candle on the opposite side of the white line? Your sell signal is a signal to enter a sell trade or exit the previous buy as well? 4. Please, correct me if I am wrong here: you are saying we will often miss the first candle, which is often a big one. This means we will be entering on the retracement. And this is best done by switching to the lower time frame (1H) and entering on the breakout. I would really appreciate if you could publish a chart to show me how you do it with your comments. Would you use just fibo or something trickier to define that entry point? If you were to use an Entry Stop where would you place it? To be continued and thank you again.

I will tell how to use traditional methods and chart patterns to minimize the risk and enter sooner than getting arrow signals About the alarm: it is already done, I will post the template in 24 hrs. 1.I applied both templates to several currencies and only EUR/USD shows PPs, support and resistance lines. Is it me again, or I have to turn it somehow on? Please update your weekly charts too, as you see I give example of many diverse pairs to show that this is not for a specific currency pair 2.I can see the time, I guess, to the close of the candle. You did not explain what to do with the time. I think you are planning to do it later, right? The time is not moving, it is stuck on 110 min 38 sec, and again, it is only on EUR/USD. It will be changed when changing the quotes (refresh), you are right about what it shows, just I intensively recommend WAIT FOR CLOSONG THE CANDLE , so in many cases that price move in your direction you will be rash to enter especially when you see the arrow signal and high momentum (fast moving price), but this is killer because before closing the current candle entering a position may harm your deposit as is so volatile and can change its direction just in some minutes. Please regard that we have many specific prices in a candle like opening, high, low, close and so on, but the close price is the most important and professionals always bring it into all their consideration 3.You said that the primary target is the cross with the yellow line (55 SMA). What is a secondary target if I don’t have PP, support and resistance on other charts? The opposite signal or the close of the candle on the opposite side of the white line? Your sell signal is a signal to enter a sell trade or exit the previous buy as well? I will publish more in detail about the targets, stops and risk management with this method in future, I see that all you are a bit rash to discover everything but market trading needs a GREAT PATIENCE; I appreciate your interests to explore the whole method. In reversal trading a buy position closes with a sell signal and vice versa, but all these signals are not eligible to enter, so shortly in most of the time a contrary signal is an exit signal but about entering short (sell) you should have enough reasons. (e.g. you are long and see a sell signal the it is better to exit but if you have knowledgeable about trading and money management you can hold the position but minimize the risk) 4.Please, correct me if I am wrong here: you are saying we will often miss the first candle, which is often a big one. This means we will be entering on the retracement. And this is best done by switching to the lower time frame (1H) and entering on the breakout. I would really appreciate if you could publish a chart to show me how you do it with your comments. Would you use just fibo or something trickier to define that entry point? If you were to use an Entry Stop where would you place it? All you want to know is the substantial part of trading knowledge that is enough to have a decent living with trading, but don’t worry friend, I will publish enough in future, just try to discover in your own because there is a possibility that you find out some tricks that I never could see. I try to send a bit more about them at this weekend. To be continued and thank you again.

ok eurusdtrader. i apply your last changes. what i have now is: you beautiful blue and red candles are gone and all candles are just green. I do have the pivot point and other lines, though. the time is not moving again. i also cannot attach ejsignal and ejtrend indicators. they are sitting there but nothing happens when i click on them, so i have no signals as well. is that what you wanted? thanks.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
it looks like the time is moving but kind of sporadically. i was also wondering: when i was replacing your finst ejsignal and ejtrend indicators, i removed both files: the file with a diamond and ex4 file. or i had to live ex4 files there? thanks

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Very nice strategy. It looks like Ibo has updated a few indicators and added one or two. This morning I reloaded the files from the first post, and everything seems to be working fine, including the bar colors, the pivots, and the clock. Good job Ibo.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hello, Thanks for sharing your system! So far it looks great. It combines most of the concepts I've seen in other MA systems. Your charts are very easy to read too. One thing about the charts. You say that the close price is very important but your red and green bars cover up the close price. Is this because the close price is part of the red/blue calculation? It's possible to show the bars through the histogram, as with the Heiken Ashi MT4 indicator. I can see the problem others mentioned about the timer but I'd call it pretty minor. I noticed in your document and in your posts you sometimes say "violate" instead of "volatile". I understand why, but it could get confusing The only other problem I had with the document is the blue-on-while text on some pages. I had a hard time reading it. Thanks again, I'll seriously check this out.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thank you eurusdtrader for providing this method. I am playing around it for the past few days and it seems to be very effective not only in the majors but also in crosses such as EUR/CAD,EUR/JPY,GBP/CHF, etc. The timing thing works well and the pivot point is very clear with your newly updated indicators. Still a lot of things to learn and discover about this method, and I look forward to your future updates and discussions.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I believe he does indeed mean "violate", not "volatile". He is talking about the shorter MA violating or breaching the longer one.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
The close prices are the tiny pins on each bar. On the blue bars it's the top pin, and on the red bars it's the bottom pin.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Great system! Would be very cool if anyone could develop a litttle script to send an email/alert when an arrow appear? Can this be possible? FT

fingotrader, you might want to check this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=4689

Hello All - My meaning was oscillation, so it was violates and definitely not volatile, anyway it was better to write a better verb and I really had not time to check my text plus I am not a native speaker of English and it is one of 6 languages that I have the acquaintance, either closer or nodding, Hereafter I will do check and anyway sorry for any misspelling or misleading sentences, please don’t hesitate to remind if there is any wrong, I believe there is no dumb question. - I get many messages, emails requesting more information, specific questions about many aspects, I again tell you please have patience, everything will be better than you can believe it. Most of friends are happy that could find a method that really works, as I saw there are different levels of knowledge among these guys and I have to think to cover the needs of all these different types. So if you read something that is so easy and clear or that is so obscure for you please don’t distress yourself and just never abandon hope, time will come that you will find out what I wanted to mention. - I don’t want to tell that preparing an alarm is not a good idea, just as a member I want to tell my opinion, forex is not a horse race, and it is like a marathon. So you really never be rash, knowing that at what moment the arrow signal gives alarm/appears is not important, because it has its own definition and it never get confirmed before closing the candle, when working H4 chart, you need a check each 4 hour and I will tell you that even you will find out how to estimate when the signal will come, for example yesterday majors rose sharply and many jumped in to trade, I never did, because I know always these is an opportunity to enter after original signal. You never need to catch all signals or the signals at the first moment; you should have a good understanding of the market, currency pairs and timing. I will cover them, so you really don’t need an alarm, I hate alarm, alarm is for emergency things, alarm means stress and stress will destroy your performance; this is not emergency work, it is a job, and it is 24/5, so if you want to make all your life an emergency you are free to do it. Decide which side you are, you are dedicating your life to forex or you are using forex to make your life better?! I was a bit frank of remarking these, it is just my opinions and I do apologize if this makes anybody inconvenient. - Please don’t regard all currency pairs if you can not cover all of them, I recommend follow 2 of them, one major and one minor, for example GBPUSD and EURJPY, after that you will get the correlations between currency pairs. I will explain it too in upcoming weeks. - some of friends are focusing on minor matters, you just try to focus on the great concepts of the markets, like patterns, resistance/supports, pivots, daily/weekly range, momentum, candle patterns and so on. When I say the close price is important you don’t need to know all about the close price and its relations with other aspects, let me simplify the matter, you don’t need monitoring 24/5, you don’t need lots of books, you don’t need the best facilities to trade better, you just need to know a simple way to make winner trades in a long run, we will do it, side by side and this will be happen with patience and perseverance. So when I don’t answer some questions clearly it is because I know you will find out that yourself and better than the way I explain in future after some experience. This weekend I will post some about the rest of this method. Have a nice day all buds Ibo

Euro, You mentioned you added one candle indicator, was this already done in your first post? If not please post the updated EA please. Also, I am interested in learning more from you and your trading style, I have been training myself for the last 4 years on the EUR/USD, and still have alot to learn. I agree with you to stick to 1 or 2 pairs to trade, it is too difficult to watch many pairs, this is where you can loss your ..... !! And please tell us where you reside, I am on the west coast of US. thanks E

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks Buddy I´ll check it out...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi Bigballer Attached is my finding when using this method on the GBP/USD pair. Please check the results for yourself. My results are quite conservative as i did not take any profits until i got a sell signal when going long(and vice versa). As with all trading methods, there is no Holy Grail. We all have to find out what works best for us. Happy Trading. MM

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi MM, I tried to open the attachment, but it did not open correctly...please check it. thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Terrific results MM. So you managed to get this strategy back in November? Or is this a backtest?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Good results. I got the system the same time as all. Just did a back test on my data. Am waiting for the additional material that Euro promised to upload later. Please note the conditions for entering and exiting a trade (as defined by EJ). Happy Trading MM

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi mmbmusa, Just for curiosity sake: if it is not very difficult, could you please explain me how to backtest anything in MT4? I tried to do it a couple of times, but it did not work for me. I am a regular computer user, so if you think it is doable and you are willing to spend some time, I would be happy to try to backtest something. If you could number the steps, like step 1, 2, 3 etc it would be great. If it involves some advanced knowledge, or takes too much of your time, than don’t worry about that. Maybe you know a good link that explains it in a simple language? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I think as in other threads it would be great to get some charts posted and get some feed back from Ibo and others, I'm sure it would help Ibo answer some questions and we will all learn from each other more easily. I have attached some screen shots and comments and would welcome Ibos' and other comments

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Sashazz I use a very different system but try the following: http://www.forex-tsd.com/3746-post20.html and http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...t4+programming Hope this helps. Attached also is a word document writen by Merlin. Hope this is helpful? MM

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Lindsay Please take a look at the attached word document (obtained from another member on this forum who was using it to explain the Vegas 4Hour Method). I found the explanation very helpful when trying to establish the point at which to enter a trade using the 8SMA. I couldn't really understand the turning up business (not really). I'll also be interested in Ibos take on this. Happy Trading MM

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hello all, Thanks for posting your system EJ! I'm new to trading... I'm looking at GBP/JPY at the moment and it looks like it might be in for a reversal. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I'm not sure about GBP/JPY...I am long on EUR/GBP at 0.6911, with a target of 0.6972. I've posted the chart. Any thoughts on this anyone?? (BTW, since I am long on EUR/GBP, I do indeed hope that GBP/JPY goes down)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
This is part of the knife system and the 8 bars back is the neutral line for the 8sma. I'm not sure on Ibo's thoughts on this as an entry criteria but would be interested to hear from him. I did not mention the turn of the 8sma in the charts posted, but I would use that as a condition of entry. I would be interested in an opinion on the other points I have mentioned referencing the distance from the 8 to the 55 SMA as conditions of entry as a a part of the Ibo system. Also the validity of the trend line in the EURCHF. Should we wait for a break of this line to enter (Trend lines rule ) This would then bring the 8SMA very near the 55SAM, and from what I uderstand from Ibo's pdf too close is no good as we won't have sufficient pips for a good trade if it retraces off the 55sma.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
My comments for what they are worth , are if you based your entry off the Ibo system then the entry should have been after the close of the 4hr bar with the arrow 0.6930. Also as mentioned in my post the proximity of the 8 and 5 sma's is a little close in comparison with eyeballing the history of the pairs. Also momentum looks a little flat at this stage although probably just consolidation and may well take off again. Good luck hope it goes.

Hello friends, When I was a child I liked to learn swimming, I tried to do that whenever and wherever I could. I did all the things that swimmers tried to learn me, how to float, how to breath, how to stroke but I scared of water, of getting soaked totally, of death, in fact I did not have the self-confidence, I was thinking there is something else that they did not tell me, there is a secret that I don’t now still, then I focus on minutiae much and much, but no response, no result, still failing to swim, then I told myself that am I ham-handed? The way of my swimming was right but there was something wrong with that, it was the belief that I can do it and I should take the bitter with the sweet. Very similar goes for trading, newbies and struggling traders know whatever that is enough to make money and trade profitably in a long run but they can not do it mostly, because always they are thinking that there is something that they need to know to start trading. I promise you that you will learn more than all your knowledge that ever have learned when you are one day rely on and believe in yourself. KISS , the old proverb: Keep It Simple and Stupid; the best systems are the simplest. I learned swimming when I never scared of water and drowning, so if you are scaring of losing and making mistakes then you never learn how to trade. I see many like to put themselves in trouble and make money with many struggles, yes, making money is not easy it is a hard work but hard work not impossible. I’d like to tell about simplicity and generality, please before reading something about markets look at that how it is general or it is simple, the general matters will waste your time, they give examples without mentioning what security (currency pair/symbol) they are talking, what time frame they are using, they say TREND, but trend means when the time frame has been mentioned. For the sake of simplicity let’s say the daily trend of eurusd is up and on H4 is up but on H1 is down and in M30 and M15 is down and in M5 and M1 is up (the prevailing trend) so it is foolish to tell the trend is up or down without remarking the time scale, and the behavior of symbols are very different, this is why many are professional just in 2/3 symbols and can not trade or at least don’t like trade other so when we say let’s say 20 pips, 8 bars, London Opening and so on, it is very different in each symbol. So this is general and will make you troubles, you will think that you don’t know enough. About the performance, you saw the work of MM, I thanked him, they seem excellent, but in real trading you can not get all of them, I call this performance mechanical or psych-free result. In real trading you will get confused and just simple rules will help you. This is not mathematic, nothing is 100% and we are not here to calculate something during the market hour, we are here to recognize and show our art of trading, don’t count pips, don’t count dollars, don’t count your dedicated time to monitor the market, don’t count the amount of your trades. It is not necessary you get in each day or have an open position to feel that you are making money. Most of time standing aside and doing nothing is making you money, because you don’t trade and then you don’t lose money. I was out completely previous week, because there was not any good set up to enter, many entered and lost or I saw they did many trades and at the end of week they had a bunch of winner and loser trades totally fruitless. The pain of a loser trade is more than the equivalent pleasure of a winner trade, so they were not break-even, they felt painfully and this is harmful for health, 1 pip in eurusd is almost 10 dollar in standard accounts but health is priceless. I just have published the best entry set up, I will tell many set ups that will enlighten your way to enter in any situation or avoid you to enter. One important thing need to be mentioned, It is about the amount/percentage of zooming on screen/charts. Please always look at charts sometimes with a good zoom out. You should see the trends, prevailing trends, major support and resistances and the tops and dips. Every day before checking the market look at the daily chart and sometimes weekly chart, I know that at first you can not understand anything from them, but I promise you that in a long term you will find a gut understanding of where price is going and then you will be so clever to find which signal is true or wrong. Dear friends please forgive me for being so clear in expressing my opinions, this is not maybe so decent but I really want to say that I never think that I give you rules or want to change your mind, I am just a member like all of you and will feel better if I am a bit of help for you. Good trading Ibo

Some people were talking about EURCHF. I went long based on the simultaneous break of a daily pin bar, pivot and 50 retrace. It's also a Knife trade if you use the pin bar instead of weekly trend direction. Euro's system shows blue bars so this backs it up. I'm a bit worried about a repeat of the recent downturn which would seem likely to happen just by eyeballing the chart. Someone mentioned going long on EURGBP. This is why you don't trade into resistance if you look at what happened since then. Set a buy stop on the other side of the MA next time GBP seems much stronger than CHF right now (USDCHF looks like a coming reversal), and Euro seems to be weakening, so EURCHF has a good chance I think. The problem is, it's a lot of time to spend on a trade that'll probably make less than 50 pips

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Ibo, are your system entering the on the retracement of GBP/USD or it somehow waiting for more confirmations of the downward move?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
oops... entering the trade, I wanted to say

1st trade using IBO system. So far Ibo's rules have kept me out of a number of trades I would have probably taken and lost on. Waiting for the bar to close has been a great piece of information and helped save me pips.The colour change and arrow indicators are a great visual aid and certainly help to gain a little confidence in trade entry. Surprisingly the time indicator (I thought redundant) is fantastic and has helped me feel in control and remain patient on waiting to enter a trade. So far Ibo's system just keeping me out of losing trades as been a huge benefit. Thanks Ibo. Any comments on the trade I posted would be welcome.

Sashazz am writing the following based on what i thinking after reading your quote above....please ALL read very carefully. Our only goal in trading should be to make MONEY. We establish our STYLE, we get a strategy/system that suits that STYLE and we back test the strategy/system to breaking point (on OUR data). We take it apart, put it back together, take it apart again and put it back together. We change this, change that, ask questions, ask more questions. We keep going until we have built incredible confidence in the system/strategy. We never trade a system until we have graded our performance on using the system (in my book, we should score 97% before even thinking about trading real money). We always WAIT for the MARKET to come to US. We are not GAMBLERS and should never chase a Setup or the market. Am writing the above because I can see some of us have not taken the time to understand or do the required homework on EJ’s 4Hrs method. What’s the difference between EJ’s 4Hr method and Vegas’s 4Hr Method? What were the creators of these strategies thinking? What can they see that we might not be seeing? What is their trading STYLE? When would they trade the strategies or stay out? WHY? Etc…. Happy Trading MM

mmbmusa, thanks for your comment. on the other note i just posted Sell Entry Order on 1.7798 on GBP/USD based on the EJ4 system. Any thoughts on that? Ibo, tell me if I am right or wrong, please?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
lindsay, i think your stop/loss is too big. if you look at risk/rev ratio here, it is a questional trade, to me. did you go to the lower time frame to fine tune it?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Sashazz, Based on my limited knowledge of Ibo's 4hr method, it looks like your GBPUSD trade was valid, so only time will tell if it was a good trade or not. We're getting some whipsawing right now, but that's to be expected. What about EUR/USD? Is anyone considering going short based on this method? We still have a couple of hours before the current 4-hr bar closes, but I want to get some opinions from the rest here. Given that there really is seemingly unlimited upside for EURUSD at this point, I'm a bit skittish about entering a short... Ibo states that we shouldn't care too much about the slope of the 55 SMA until the price starts to approach it, so that's the logic I'm going off of... - Ian

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Sashazz, the answer to your pm is in the VWVB Daily Chart Analysis thread post #594 thru #599. I am still not sure on my trend determination yet... hope that helps, Scott

--- 帖子 #54 ---
thanks iboerma. actually, i changed it after i published my numbers to 1.7786. Ibo! please, show how you did it or you still not in the trade? teach me please... i am eager to learn from you.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
thanks smjones, i checked them out before i pmed you. they are too conceptual, i would say, or maybe this is just my poor english. i was hoping for couple of examples with your notes. especially from you successful week that you published before - i think this was a textbook week. i envy you for the beauty of there execution there. it is a white envy, though. but no worries...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
sure, I will look through my notes and find that and get back to you... Scott

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Sashazz, I agree with you. I think the Vegas Wealth Builder system has some serious merit, but I found the interpretation of reversal candles, the use of multiple Fib levels based on currency pair and some other items left far too much to the imagination. The EJ model, at first glance, seems more intuitive and simple, though that is just my first impression. Some systems resonate with some traders while others don't. This is just my opinion. I look forward to learning more about this method with you all in the coming weeks... - Ian

I have a question for those of you, why are using MT4: There is a Fibonacci extension tool with the default values 61,8; 100; 161.8 I read somewhere before, and I did it this way: I added extensions to my regular Fibonacci tool, so that it draws retracements and extensions in one go at : 127. 2; 161.8; 2; 261.8. Why would the lines be at different places? And which one you think is correct? See yellow and magenta lines.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Ibo, Thanks so much for being generous with both your trading method and your willingness to help us all learn more about it. It looks very intriguing, to say the least. I did have one big question for you. In the introduction to the method in your PDF document, you state: " When yellow line (55SMA) has a positive slope means the major trend is up and we buy, when pointing down we go short (sell)". However, later in your EUR/USD trade example, you say " In this type of entry the slope of yellow must not be regarded except when price is getting closer to that, because it may rebound from that and continue its major trend that would be our exit point." What is your rule of thumb in determining whether or not to open a trade when the trading signal is in conflict with the direction of the 55 SMA? Do you just look at a timeframe above the 4H (say Daily) to confirm the trade signal? Thanks, Ian

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hello everybody, Ian you asked a good question. We don't play with lines/MAs. my meaning of this type of entry was the best entry setup, you should recognize a decent trend then expect a good reversal (good distance between lines), so now you ask what is a decent trend, I have a short answer wait 1 day more and read it tomorrow in EJ_4H Method Part II. Rgds Ibo

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Ibo, Sounds good. We'll look forward to your next installment. Regards, Ian

--- 帖子 #62 ---
A common response (from various MA systems I've read about) to the question of when not to trade toward the slow MA is (another question): Is it possible to tell the difference between a rebound off the slow MA versus a crossing of the MA, and still take some decent profit in the time it takes to react to the bad news? My definitions for these things include at least 8-12 hours while I might be away from my computer after I think the trade is going well, and/or a well-considered stoploss placement. It's hard to translate price into time, so... Some systems I've looked at don't consider entering the trade until both the price and fast MA fully cross or bounce off the slow MA, and then the price touches the fast MA and then starts to move in the desired direction. There's a lot of stuff to consider, but the stuff about fitting the system to your schedule is really important and is the main mistake I've been making lately. There's some advice floating around about only trading off daily or higher charts, and it makes more and more sense as time goes on.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Fib levels fall under the category of "probable support and resistance". I like trendlines and actual recent highs and lows better. The only lines that are correct are the ones you actually see the price reacting to. If several lines happen to be in the same place, one of them might be "correct" but you still need to see how price reacts to this level. Watch how price reacts to the fib levels. It will tend to bounce around within them. This is more to keep you out of trades than get you in them, which is good. If price crashes through or bounces hard off several fib levels drawn from different points, you might have something.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
USDJPY is tough. It's in a major squeeze going back several months, all about to start expanding. I'm playing daily trendline breakouts on this (hmm, it might have just broke upward as I'm writing this) but look at GBPUSD when it first started breaking out on the week of 4/2. It fully reversed, consolidated again, and then actually broke out. So be careful.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I don't want to monopolize the conversation, but there's a cool feature of the brightly colored EJ charts if you spread them out in an MT4 profile. You can easily see which trades are correlated. For example, AUDUSD, EURJPY, EURUSD, and GBPUSD are behaving about the same right now. USDCAD, USDJPY, and USDCHF are all doing pretty much the opposite. This looks like a good way to quickly judge the overall market and pick only the best pairs to trade while not getting overly invested in a single currency.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
hey Mike, my question was purely technical. i was and still am curious how other people are usning fibo lines on mt4. at least if we, as people who are interested in ej4 system, will be using it in the same way, then we all are on the same page, so i would guess it makes total sense to have it done the same way. Ibo, are you just using defaults as fibo lines or you have some special tricks here as well? why all of us would not adjust it the same way? i am suggesting to use only one tool, which will be creating both extensions and retracements. if you are interested i can publish my settings and then we all can come to some common solution. thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hello We will use most of instruments in trading, fibo is included. dont worry. I think I need more than 6 months to publish whole conceptions. I changed the background into white that kids print the document easily. It took my time almost 2 days to rewrite the document. I try to post part II late today. Yours, Ibo

I expect you would need some pretty big "Kahoona's" or wallet to trade effectively [/quote] Lindsay, I agree. Trading the higher timeframes (daily and above) is a luxury that many of us "little guys/gals" can't really afford without significant capital to enable us to absorb the inevitably higher drawdowns. Whipsawing at this level takes on a whole new meaning and really tests your psychological trading mettle. That's why I think the 4H timeframe is a happy medium between the 1H and the daily. You can easily see the trend on that level, but your range/whipsawing generally isn't astronomical. I use the Daily timeframe to confirm my trades at lower timeframes, but have had little success trading solely at that timeframe... Just my two cents on the issue. Ian

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks for your insight, Mike. I think the issue with many of the systems I've seen that require a touch of the slow/fast MAs is that you have given up a significant portion of pips waiting for it to happen. I'm all for being conservative in Forex and waiting for multiple confirmations before entering a trade, but I'm not convinced that the touch/bounce MA systems are any more reliable than the "slope change"/bar color change systems like the EJ-4H and the like. I also agree that trading on the daily and higher timeframes would be great - the trend is unmistakeable and gives you much more confidence in your trade - the downside is the fact that you need far more capital to absorb the greater drawdown and nerves of steel to wait out the big swings in price. Like you, I also think Ibo's colored bars are one of the coolest additions to the MT4 charts I've seen.

Hi everybody, Part II is available. I never had the time to check for proofreading, if there is a mistake either logical or grammatical please send me a private email that I revise it ASAP. wb stands for white background Rgds Ibo

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Ibo, i just downloaded your stuff. thank you. i can see new templates and indicators there. should i delete all i had before? will i still have pivot points? i cannot live without them now. thanks.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Ibo, where do you download it from ? thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
go to the very first page

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi traders, Keep all indicator and templates, use them in case that you need. when you need to use PP then up the template with pp and if you dont need then use plain templates. for saving your eye-sight health use black background. I just put the white back ground to facilitate printing. Please: 1- take a good rest during weekend (dont think about forex) 2- Try to find similar examples on other charts yourself. 3- Study the history much before asking any question, a peompt answer never work for you always. have a nice weekend Ibo

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Dear Eurusdtrader Thanks a 100 x million for a wonderful system. I appreciate your work and time that you put into this. This is what I have been searching for a long time. Enjoy your weekend. Kind regards. Nesalc

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I just read this thread. I can't rest in this weekend. I have to re-read it. The documents also. I will spend some time at the beach, but reading, of course. Thanx for sharing the system.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Nice work IBO, thanks for giving me loads of work to do this weekend . Have a nice one. MM

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Ibo, i think it would be great if you could every once in a while publish a "proper" entry and exit examples, the way you do it. it would be much easier to follow your system. what do you think? impatient

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thank you very much. I feel like I am learning a lot, thanks to you. One question about your newly uploaded indicators (Part II). The new template (Ej_4H_mp) that shows the pivot and S/R lines are at different levels than the original one (Ej_4H_wp) from part I. I am assuming you're using a different calculation... which one do you recommend we use? Thanks

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I don't know if this will help or not but you can overlay the 2 stochs into 1 window. Just set up the daily stoch, then drag then stock from the navigator window where upon it will show you the parameter window then adjust the settings for the 4 hr chart and press ok.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
thank you, lindsay. i have been trying to figure out how to do it for a long time and could not get it. i was experimenting with cci intensively and needed to combine 2 of them in the same window. you rock!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
lindsay, i thought maybe you know the answer to my other question as well: i've spent so much time playing with charts that i just cannot afford to lose them if something happens to my computer. when i am backing it all up, i usually copy experts, profiles, and templates folders. my thinking is that if i have to restore it all, these three are the folders i need in order to do restore it fast on another computer, if the need be. is that correct, or i have to copy something else, like settings, for example? thanks

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hey, Yeah, that's all you need. I have a laptop and a main pc that I use, and the way I restore the settings from one to another is by just archiving those directories into one file and copying them to the respective locations. D2T

--- 帖子 #85 ---
thanks driven2trade. for some reason i was thinking i might need config folder, too.

Euro, I just came across this thread and downloaded your information. First, Thanks for sharing your system and information with us. It looks very interesting to me and I wish to learn more about it. You have some great results on the GBP/USD pair. I do use Metatrader 4 and currently employ the Vegas Wealth Building Model. I still have to read through your documents, but wanted to follow-up on the MT4 scripts and the initial chart set-up. Can you or someone walk me through step 1: the chart set up. This is what I have done thus far for the GBP/USD pair: 1)Set-up a 4 hour chart 2)Overlaid on this chart the following: EJ_CandleTime, EJ_Signal, EJ_Trend I do not see the white SMA line or the yellow 55 SMA. Are these within the initial indicators? Do I need to configure the chart properties within MT4 at all..as far as the chart bar colors etc..? I also get some different colors showing up on the bars initally, but could edit them... Part II also has an indicator as well… I wanted to make sure I had the chart set-up correctly first, then I will get into the system itself. A suggestion: perhaps we can set-up a chart anaysis section on this thread and perhaps for the GPB/USD pair to start with and share our learning’s…this way we will all learn from each other… Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I THINK A CHART ANALYSIS SECTION WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA BUT PERHAPS WE COULD HANDLE 3 PAIRS, SAY GBPUSD, USDCHF AND PERHAPS FOR SOMETHING WITH A DIFFERENT PERSONALITY THE EURGBP. I HAVE SET MY CHARTS UP WITH THE SAME INDICATORS AS YOU HAVE PLUS THE FFTUNNEL 3.1. I HOPE THIS HELPS.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Mike, You can take a look at my picture, I am hoping this is what Ibo meant. The color of the time may be different, Ibo used blue in his second update but it seamed too dark to me, so I left yellow. Also, I changed the color of the stochastic lines. Use file EJ_Pivot_DWM from the first part to get pivot points. I think I had white line in the initial setup files. You can see in both downloads not only the indicators, but also templates. Use them, then if you install ej_4h_wp you will get it all plus pivot points. The picture Lindsay showed above has some extra lines, maybe from the knife system or something else, so you can take a look at mine. I did not add any extras here, only Ibo’s stuff. The only difference is that I put both stochastics in the same window using the trick lindsay showed above. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
lindsay, where could i read about fftunnel, please? thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I have been looking at the 34EMA as a stop placement when in a trade. If price closes above the 34 when selling or below when in a buy I would then exit the trade. I have manually backtested this and compared the results to getting out on a turn of the 8ma or a 30, 40, 50 pip trailing stop and have found that even though it gets a little scary some times I get far better rides sticking to the close above or below the 34 EMA. The areas where price consolidates or retraces a long move I would normally get stopped out and miss some good moves. With the 34 ema even though you give back some pips sometimes it still I beleive gives better overall results. Also I entered the USDCHF and USDJPY for buys from their most recent buy signals on the 20th of April and now looking at my 34 ema theory realise I should have stayed out. I'm not saying that to enter a trade that their should aways be across over the 34 ema it would to often give up too many pips. On the other hand it may be beneficial where there has been a long move waiting for price to cross the 34 to get out and sometimes to get in. I would really love some others to back test my theory and compare their own results on getting out on the price closing above or below the 34 EMA. I realise that my doing it manually can be subject to errors and subconcious bias.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
It was in the Private Forum but I was since posted somewhere in the FF, I looked but could not find where. The emas are 55 and 8 and the dotted lines are fib levels off the 55 ma showing possible overbought and oversold areas. You can adjust the fib levels in the properties box to either 1,2 or 3 depending upon the currencies tendencies and visually where price sits on the fibs most often.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
lindsay, if you are interested there is a whole good working trading system built on the WAVE - 34 emas on high, close, and low. see www.raghee.com i am experimenting with it now, too. she also wrote a book: Forex Trading for Maximum Profit. but this is entirely different topic, i guess.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Lindsay, Thanks for the FFTunnel. I had one version that show the trend on the weekly chrt, but this one is different! BTW, do you apply the appropriate risk model for the pair when using the Tunnel indicator? I am also up for three pair on the analysis... Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thanks Sashazz, yes this does help. I think I have everything set up exept for the ej_4h_dual stoch_wb.tpl (and other tpl files) how are these set up and used in Metatrader. My chart now looks similar to yours... Thanks MIke

--- 帖子 #95 ---
no problem

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes I do this visually looking for where price tends to consolidate on the fibs and where price tends to turn from an extreme fib

Hello Kids, 1- Read the first post again for instructions (this may help some newbies that have problems in setting up the method) 2- PROPER ENTRY: this is what we will work at least 6 months to find out how to enter properly. 3- About discussing trades by this method I agree, maybe this will help you to get closer to the method, but don't start another thread please, this may diversify the efforts. 4- I will cover how to trail the price, how to book your profits, how to manage your account and positions, how to minimize the risk, but friends all these will take its proper time, so don't hurry, I do not expect that you trade excellent at this time by this method, just if you use the best entry setup you are the best student. 5- You should keep it simple, don't try to enter more indicators to support some aspects, all aspects that you can not find at the time being, will be discussed in future. 6- Please forget pips/day, at least say pips/week. With this mehtod you are aiming intellectual targets like 100 pips, so don't think that you can seize 20 pips per day, try to trade one time a week but profitably and with less stress., expend the rest of your time to enjoy the life. If you can make 100 pips consistently per week I will show you that you will be a millionaire just in 2 years. So don't try to make more and more with working 24/7. This is not the way. 7- The methos of 34 EMA is working on M30 chart so please read number 9 below. 8- If you find or think of something usefull with this method (like indicators, tricks, templates and so on) before posting, please send me a private email describing your opinion and I will try it before publishing to avoid wasting the time of kids and perturbing their learning. 9- If you want that I shorten your way to win at least one year just please bear in mind that : A)All indicators in MT4 and most of custom indicators are useless, just some of them with their special setting are a bit of help; so don't waste your time to discover a magic from them. I just like Ichimoku because it is really predict the potential supports/resistances. B)Don't strive to trade smaller time frame than H4. All these were my personal opinions, I am maybe mistaken, I just told my own oipnions with all respects. Happy trading Ibo

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi ForexMike, As far as setting up the charts to look the way Ibo has them, I didn't fiddle with adding this indicator here or that one there, I just overlaid the appropriate template onto my chart. If you added Ibo's indicators and compiled them before overlaying the template, it should automatically add the correct indicators. If you find you want to add or remove one or more, you can do so at that point, but just adding the template to the chart should do the trick for most of what you need. Hope this helps, Ian

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Ibo, Thanks for posting part II of the method and continuing to share your insights with us. I definitely agree that we should strive to keep this thread as EJ_4H-centric as possible since that is why we all tuned in to begin with. If we have similar systems to share or off-topic items that would distract the newbie from learning this method, then I think we should all agree to keep those conversations outside of this thread. I know that doing this would make navigating ALL the threads on FF much easier and less daunting for those who haven't been part of the thread since the beginning. - Ian

--- 帖子 #100 ---
hi Ibo, thanks for your big letter. i have always been scared even to look at ichimoku so i would like to know what you know. btw, it was a big article about it in the Currency Trader last month, so now at least i know some basics. why would’t you personally publish, at least once a week, an "ideal" current trade with your comments? if you are busy it won't take much time because you are trading it anyway, right? for example, i am really curious if you jumped on GBP when it moved down last week and everybody was shorting it (including myself)? and thanks for the white background. impatient

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thank IBO...all great points: I think I am all set with the chart set-up… The daily chart analysis of a few pairs would be great so that we can learn from you and each others in a step by step by step manner. Constant daily analysis will over time allow us to perfect this system and enhance our trading and lifestyle. I will suggest the following: GBP/USD, USD/CHF, and I am open for a third pair: perhaps a cross such as EUR/GBP or EUR/CHF…or a more volitle pair such as GBP/JPY or GBP/CHF. I am excited and look forward to leaning more and studying this method. Thanks Again, Mike

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Ibo, From a sheer technical point of view , it looks like the USD bulls may be in line to take another run at buying up the dollar on Monday. EUR/USD and GBP/USD both show as overbought in the 4H and Daily stochastics and the price action looks to be retracing downward again. Same situation for the other USD pairs. Fundamentally, however, given that the interest-rate differential of the USD is steadily waning, that several countries (including Switzerland most recently) are divesting themselves of the dollar as the primary denomination of their currency reserves, and that the general macroeconomic health of the US seems to be less assured every day, I wonder how long even minor USD bullishness can last. The overriding trend is definitely bearish the dollar in my opinion. Ibo - What is your view on using technicals vs. fundamentals with the EJ_4H method? Do you integrate fundamentals within your trading or do you just let the price action dictate your trades 100%? What about big news releases - do you close out of your positions beforehand or just ride the storm? Thanks in advance, Ian

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Dear Traders, Fundamental aspects will be covered on time, at the time shortly I should tell you that forget them totally, Just for some being preserved don't enter a trade if there is a very important news on the way to be aired or take a very preserving risk management if you have some positions on. I have a suggestion about discussing daily trading oportunities or comments or forecast, I think it is better that if any member like to talk about such issues color-code it by dark blue (or another common agreed color) I see that many of kids are so eager to talk about taking positions and talking about them, I took gbp and audusd (short) and booked them with 0 and -15 pips, still gbp and eur has lower sentiment but this is business and price is king, I prefered to wait and see what is the price action on Monday. So your short trades on eur and gbp were right decisions, you have gotten right direction, but there are many times that market completely act contrary to the consensus. Rgds Ibo

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Sounds good IBO blue it is…and Ian, I agree with your assessment…I think the underlying dollar confidence is likely to remain weaker with increased concerns over the structural deficits. Therefore, I am bearish the dollar, and Bullish on the Pound, CAD, and AUD over the near term. Mike

Hi everybody, bigballer thanks for your suggestion, but as most of members were agreed with me, we preferably never start another group. I am sure this work will just distract us especially new members. I have received many emails demanding a signal sending service, friends, I know that there are many sites related to known associations/brokers that offer forex learning up to 2k and at least $500 and give you just some fruitless documents of very old indicators and general rules. I know that they offer you indicators that never has a good performance for hundreds of dollars. I am thinking about this matter that provide a signal service that needs an update just one time each 24hr. If I made a solid decision I will tell you in advance, but I think it will take time. At that service I should provide an online sessions to tell very detailed tricks. When I use tricks, it is not a secret, it is all about what all traders have in hand but some can filter the misleading aspect and extract proper views and some can not. Still I am not sure that I will discuss at all about the current situation of the market and opportunities or not. I afraid that this may not help you and harm your self-confidence, but I know that you should have trainers/teachers for all your life's aspects. If you have any discussion about this matter, please send me a message or a private email. Happy trading Ibo

Hi Ibo I think teaching people to trade for themselves has far more value than any signal service, once someone has learned the trading they do it for themselves, signals are always from someone else and you still need the discipline to follow the signals anyway. Good giving out the fantastic information you are giving and I think alot of people will be happy and eventually very wealthy. The above of coarse is just my oppinion. Happy learning and happy trding to all.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi Ibo, My 2 cents worth are that taking us through possible trades in the market and your analysis would be invaluable to all of us. As we have only just been introduced to your system and have a long way to go taking us through from the start to end of a trade would be fantastic. Should you in time professionalise your system and be rightfully compensated more power to you. From a selfish point of view, I only hope that we at the forum would recieve more of your generous tutoring.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Lindsay I think it would be nice for Ibo to take us through a trade or two but i don't think this will help anyone (really). We are traders and Ibo has given us a good tool to trade with. It is now down to each one to adapt this tool to their trading style. Ibo's trading style is very different to mine and am sure it is very different to yours. Discussing what we see/don't see on a chart will be great but walking people through trades.......NO NO. Cheerful Trading all MM

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I appreciate your comment but I know I am not yet a trader and a lot of others in the forum like me are new to it. So from that point of view I think any insights and viewpoints would be a tremendous aid to helping us developing a trading style.

Ibo, I dont know if you touched on this, what again is the number that appears to the right of the current bar: &lt; -- 208:16 ??? thanks

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I think that's the minutes remaining until the close of the bar.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
oh? it does not really count down.. If it does count down, it counts down weird

It does count down actually. And it changes only when there's a change in the price quote.

Hi All, New to forex (trading in general really) and this was one of the first sites and threads I've read - FANTASTIC!! Thanks Ibo. I'm now demoing this strategy. Based on a buy signal, and taking resistance at around 114.97 into consideration I entered a buy stop at 115.02 USDJPY long. I put a stop at 114.69 which is just below old resist/support at 114.75. The thing I wonder about is maybe I should have waited for some positive slope action on the daily stoch. Also based on the breakout of consolidation between 114.75 &amp; 114.29. Does this sound reasonable? Still waiting for gby,euro and the aud. Comments please. Snags.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Well, based on this system I personally don't agree with this trade for the following 3 reasons: 1.There is no space between the price and the 55EMA 2.The 55EMA is a very very strong downtrend, which means that it's not that wise to enter a long position. 3.Both long-term and short-term Stochastic Oscillators are in overbought area. I might rather wait for a rebound from the 55EMA and enter a short trade instead. Happy trading and welcome to forex.

I think that I would wait for a close above the 50% retracement of the prior high at 115.95 and the recent low. The pair have consolidated after a lengthy move down and the consolidation may well prove to be exhaustion. Retracing a long move is to be expected and the 50% area may be a strong resistance level and lead to a further downturn, that is why I would wait for a close above the 50% retracement

Hi Snags, I entered the same long USD/JPY trade you did at 114.98 and am still riding it at the current price of 115.18. USD/JPY took a serious drop and a correction is due. The 5-period stoch was nearing overbought when I went long, but we all know that can last as overbought for a while. In addition, the 30-period stoch is a far better indicator of potential for direction, and it was reading 6, which is in-line with value at the beginning of other corrections in the pair. I set my take-profit to 115.47 as I based it on possible resistance created from the daily low of 115.50, set on 03/20. Nevertheless, I'm keeping a close eye on the price, as I'm not convinced this pair has the momentum to even approach that resistance at this point... Yes, the 55SMA is heading down, but in my opinion, that's to be expected with the significant drop the pair took when it gapped down. I would like to hear Ibo's opinion on this trade as well, but I think it is in-line with the EJ_4H method rules. Keep in mind that Ibo wants us all to enter our trading comments in BLUE so they can be differentiated from his. This will make it easier for newbies to the thread to quickly review Ibo's entries from the rest of ours if they don't want to read all the banter right off the bat. Happy trading, Ian

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Rongshishong, I'm not sure what you mean when you say there's "no space between the price and the 55EMA". When I bought (and roughly when Snag bought), the price was at 114.98 and the 55EMA was at 117.03, making the difference 203 pips, which is more space than this pair has seen for quite a while... Yes, the 55EMA is moving down sharply, but because the pair gapped down so severely, I would hesitate to call this a true "downtrend" of any length as that is not confirmed on the Daily chart, so I personally ignored the slope of the 55EMA for this trade. My short-term Stoch was nearing overbought when I went long, but the long-term was at rock bottom (which is a far better indicator of overall direction than the short), so I'm confused as to what long-term Stoch you were reading. Take a look at 12/19/2005 on USD/JPY and you'll see a similar trading setup to the one we see today, which was good for around 100 pips. - Ian

Thanks for the input folks. Ian, The way you described it was the way I saw it also. How tight do you set your stops on these trades? When it got to 25 pips I moved mine to BE. Snags. BTW how do you include someone else's quote in a reply?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Just press the Quote button in the lower right corner of the person's post you want. Also, you can edit your own post with the button to the right of that... thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Sorry folks, I screw up something. I just found that I was looking at the 1H chart before. It was indeed a nice trade. The only problem I saw is that the short-term Sto is still in the overbought area. Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Anyone think we are at a Double Top in the EURUSD with this one? Pivots are at 123.00 respectively thanks

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I set my stop a bit too tight on this one, as I set a trailing stop of 20 pts and got stopped out after only 20 pips... I'm not entirely convinced of the momentum behind this correction, so I gave it a lot less room to breathe. Anyway, 20 pips is better than negative pips anyday...

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Yes, any PIP day is a good day. I got 125 for the day so far....on 0.5 microlots thanks

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Nice job on the pips, I think I got out of my USD/JPY trade just in time. Looks like it's starting to head south again, at least temporarily, as the 30-period stoch is still hanging out in 'oversold' territory...

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Good morning: New to this site. Can I get a clarification on "no space between"? Thanks Johnny

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Johnny, First, please read the two PDF files Ibo has made available on the first post of this thread to get an understanding of what the trading method is all about. He explains his approach there. In short, the 'no space between' comment was referring to the pip range between the price and the value of the 55 period moving average. Best, Ian

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Dear All Sorry for delay, I had a problem in connecting to the net and could not send promised issue on time. Stop Loss Placing although is a very important thing and there are several ways to do this but most of the time traders use a very simple and easy to place regarding some aspects that I will discuss later on. You can find out how you should place a surefire stop for an entry, you get 5-20 pips regarding your risk-reward ratio and the currency pair and some other aspects like the volatility the market and relations with PPs and fibo levels. It is not important that at the time you can get the best entry, everybody will have problems and mistakes in starting. please consider that YOU WILL LEARN WHEN YOU MAKE A MISTAKE. so if you are making mistakes don't distress yourself, just please refer to that and learn ONE THING from that, after some time you get better and better and at that time you have not much mistakes and then you will try for higher performances. Thanks all kids sent some stuff.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Dear Friends, Maybe I should tell you that this week really is not so technical, and there are many strange and non-technical moves, so if you see that you are so mistaken this is not because of your fault, this is because of a non-technical era, I can not speak so much about such issues, just wanted to mention not distress yourselve. Happy trading, Ibo

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Ibo, No doubt. I've been pretty much on the sidelines with the exception of a 20 pip USD/JPY and another AUD/USD 23 pip trade this week. Now that the Fed has laid their cards on the table saying they will take a temporary break from raising interest rates and the Euro was able to break out of its range, I think next week will prove more fruitful... Anyway, let's hope so! - Ian

--- 帖子 #147 ---
TimeFreedom, totally you made a good entry, but as I said there are many ways to put a proper stop loss, you should choose a reasonable range for each surrency pair and each trade, I am not specialist in gbpjpy, but I recommend try to keep yur stops as tight as you can, plus this week was one of the very non-technicals, very strong signals but very confilicting moves. Personally I still stayed out and just pose very surefire orders I agree with Ian, market will make nice opprotunities after comming back to its harmony. more technical comments will be discussed after publishing related lessons. Happy trading Ibo

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Ibo, Not trading or patience is something I need to work on. I am learning that waiting for the less risky setups are best. Live and learn. Thanks, TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #149 ---
TimeFreedom, You said the thing that I will tell in upcoming psychologic issues frequently, many learn how to trade but few learn how not to trade; there are some conditions that you should feel and stand aside, just be patient and wait for the best. 1 trade each week is enough, don't imagine that 100 pips is few. You should never think of the number of trades, the number of pips, you should think about performance. After months of experience I found out that the key to success is recognizing when to trade and when staying out even you have a very strong strategy/system. Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Timefreedom There are three actions that you will ask yourself on a daily basis as a trader: 1) Am i Buying? 2) Am i Selling? and 3) Should i Stand aside? The most difficult for most traders is number 3. Number 1&amp;2 require you to have a good strategy/system and to be disciplined enough to pull the trigger when you get a trading signal. Number 3 requires a great deal of 'Personal' discipline. You have to know how to wait for the right trades, you have to know how to wait for the market to show you where it is going and you need to have tremendous mental strength. Use your pain of loss to turn yourself into a better trader. Keeping records of your trades is a good starting point to developing the good discipline required to be a great trader. Happy Trading MM Ps. NEVER forget to place your stop losses.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
TimeFreedom, How many pips you got from GBPJPY? You may have more than 200 pips in your long position? If you see the EURJPY that has a similar trace to this pair, you can see than if you had sell position on that pair you would be in safe sidebefore buy signal, anyway this is the power of the best entry setup and reversal trading on H4. Have a nice weekend Ibo

Ibo i'd like to thank you for sharing your method that seems to be really good. I started yesterday testing it in a demo account and here's my open trades using EJ_4H method , i achieved more than 900 pips in less than 24hr http://img107.imageshack.us/img107/1861/screen9aq.jpg GBP/JPY = +223 pips EUR/JPY = +42 pips NZD/USD = +34 pips GBP/USD = +210 pips USD/CHF = +180 pips CHF/JPY = +101 pips EUR/CHF = +123 pips Total = 913 pips !!! I don't know may be it was a lucky day but if i will reach 1/10 of this performance every day on a real account i will be a very happy man

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Skyline, I am happy that you have seized such an incredible profit, I will cover the condition of market in Fridays and Mondays, but I think there are 2 things need to be mentionned: 1- Luck is with one who has the belief. 2-Of course in real trading this will be hard to seize such incredible pips just in 24 hours, but you can definitely seize more than what you want (1/10) with proper implementation and discipline. Keep in touch buddy, Have a nice weekend all guys, Ibo

--- 帖子 #154 ---
MM &amp; EURUSDTRADER, Thanks for your input. I think I am finally starting to use my discipline and wait for the right setup instead of trying to be in a trade every single trading day of the week. Thanks, Time Freedom

EURUSDTRADER, Originally I made two Buy trades on GBPJPY &amp; EURJPY. Got stopped out on GBPJPY with -137 pips. Re-entered on new signal and closed with +211 pips T/P. EURJPY is currently +84.

Hello Ishay, All that has been discussed on this system is in this thread. So you should start at the beginning of this thread and read it trough... Here is a good tutorial for MT4 and you can open a demo acoount there as well and the software is free.. http://www.strategybuilderfx.com/sfxmanual/ Have wonderful weekend... Scott

I'm working with Fxsol and GFT. Is the software they have similar to Meta Trader? They have no green bars and no arrows. Ishay

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Ishay, FXsol and GFT are using their proprietary platforms (GTS and DealBook respectivelly). These platforms provide nothing that would be similar to MQL/EA of MT4/3

--- 帖子 #160 ---
new to thread, great stuff and thanks to EJ. just to clarify there have been many references to the 55MA being EMA rather than SMA. From the PDFs I'm sure it's an SMA.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Ishay, Don't despair. Many download MetaTrader and use a demo price feed to do their analysis and then make their trades with their broker, using their proprietary platform. It is much more convenient to have MT4 be your trading platform when using systems like EJ_4H, but it's not the end of the world if you don't. Happy trading, Ian

Hello Friends 1-please don’t forget the blue color of texts discussing about positions and daily market. 2-Traders who use other platforms can register for a demo account of a broker who uses MT4 as its platform, up the method’s implements in the MT4 and trade on their platforms when their MT4 gives a signal that suits them. 3- Regarding many requests from members it is likely that I construct a private mentoring service, of course this will be limited in case of getting assured. (I think it will be 10 members totally). I am designing a very different and proper mentoring program for both newbies and struggling traders. This may be a very new method in mentoring focusing on personal abilities and experiences of the members. A pretest may be taken to recognition of the level and characteristics and needs of the member. More detailed in upcoming weeks. The free document parts will be OK but the private members will have premiums and some detailed information that won’t be discussed in that documents. 4- I will cover the price trailing in this method as I see this is a demand. Happy trading Ibo

Thank you for backtesting. Did you used the H4 timeframe? Did you used only the arrows and nothing else (for example no confirmation using MA slope or some other methods, no stoploss)? Did you used the defaut prameters or made some changes to them? I have written an EA to backtest these signals, but my results are diferent. See attached file - EUR/JPY March 2006 backtested. RoBiK

RoBik, Would you mind posting the EA you coded here? That's one thing I've been wanting to look at as well, but I don't have the coding skills to put an EA together with any sort of speed... Thanks, Ian

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Ibo, It would seem to me that the EJ_4H method is purposely built to take advantage of reversals in a ranging/lightly trending market. Given that all signs point to the beginning of what could be longer-term overall weakness in the USD across most currencies, we may find ourselves in a heavily trending market. Yes, there will some retracements that we can take advantage of, but in a heavily trending market, the price rarely crosses the 55SMA, but more often bounces off of it. Given that you DO NOT advise entering a long trade when the 8SMA is ABOVE the 55SMA (and vice-versa for SHORT trades), it would seem to me that we would be looking at very, very few "acceptable" trades using this method within a seriously trending market. Take a look at EUR/USD on the 4H chart from November, 2003 to January, 2004 or you can look at EUR/USD from October, 2004 to December, 2004. During these two time periods, the EUR was on a serious roll and we had, perhaps, 2 to 3 trade possibilities that met all the criteria for the EJ_4H method (e.g.: 8SMA below 55SMA and moving up, sufficient distance between 8SMA and 55SMA, etc.) Not being a trend trader myself, I'm hoping this same trendedness doesn't take over all the USD pairs, but I'm also a realist, and it looks like that well may happen. How do you reconcile the current trending market conditions with the EJ_4H method? Is there any room to enter long trades even though the 8SMA is ABOVE the 55SMA (since I don't anticipate seeing the 8SMA cross below the 55SMA that often)? If not, we may see little return using this method on USD pairs as we will not have many trading signals. and may have to just trade the crosses. Thoughts? - Ian

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Could you post your EA Robik? So i can try to adapt to my trading style to EJ I used H4 timeframe and only arrows. Furthermore my backtest was only manual so there was no stop loss , but simply i write down entry and exit value, so i have a short position then a long , then again a short and so on. It's quite simple to do this in EJ method 'cause there is arrows that tell us when to enter and exit from trade. Obviously when i'm a actual trade i put a large stop loss (about 100 pips) and adjust trailing when i hit important pips gain. However using this mechanical way to trade EJ method, since last 27 Apr i have 7 positions opened for a total of about 800-900 pips (just today i closed one position on gbp/jpy because trailing stop of 100 pips was reached in a retrace).

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Dear Ian and all friends, Thanks for your notes, it is good to mention and strive to discover the reality of everything. 1- Again you are rash, I just told the best entry setup, as you mentioned this is a reversal trading method and there are many setups that let you enter a position. On the other hand we have many securities to trade, moreover we are here to make money, it is not important that you trade EUR or GBP or Gold or any other symbol. Remember that I told you should get familiar with behavior of pairs. Majors totally are so skittish and volatile as well as forex is a very sensitive market. 2- I can not really learn all you need by this way, because everybody has his/her own demands and level, so this needs a proper private mentoring and following market for some month to see how we should act in any situation and get stronger to implement the method for ourselves. 3- If there is somebody who tells can learn a strong method to you just in a very short period I think he/she is maybe an imposter. I guess I need to publish at least 20 parts of my documents to reveal sufficient aspects of method to trade properly and profitably. Maybe at the time you are making money just with this few data, but my meaning of properly was so complex, some methods and most of time short term methods is so harmful to health. You will find out when it is late. Health is priceless. 4- If you just enter arrow signals in long run you will be winner but why in practice guys can not do this? It is because they neglect the emotion, stress, patience, daily news or rumors airing pressures, commentaries. Because they neglect proper risk management with the method. Because they are living in many different time zones and miss some opportunities, because they have different personality and lifestyle. I can enumerate more. 5- If this really works, why free, why I did not sell it? Making money is a need but until your income meets your needs, more than that will hurt you. Personally I like art of trading and when I see that I can make money when I want then I don’t have any desire to strive for more and more. We had many millionaire traders or maybe billionaire, but we have just one trader named W. D. Gann. I never want to say that I want to be famous; it is really never help me to be happy man. I feel I am happy really when I see that I am a bit of help for others. So, I have to differentiate between people who want to know much and appreciate and who just want to be a second-guesser. 6- Last but not least, all our methods are on the basis of trending principles so definitely all methods work on the basis of trending markets (supply and demand) 7- It is not so wise that you think you should trade all heavy trends because they are the ones you had to choose. There will be many like this that you will be in doubt to enter or not and when you are in doubt then stay out. The same goes for candles, when you see a candle with 100 pips of range you think that you could seize at least 70 pips of that just in 1 hour easily; but really they are ones you may be so careful to trade (Although in this method I have setups that seize them ) 8- I will explain the way to recognize very heavy and strong trends. But this is impossible by this way. It will be possible for private members in conjunction with market following for some months to see different situations of market and being ready for reversals or staying out in time and enjoying their life. 9- I attached 2 snaps to see how it was really so simple 1-2-3 pattern to enter with a breakout confirmation and manage your position, I believe all this trades were aggressive. Sorry for long letter, Good trading Ibo

I wanted to respond to the EUR/USD Trade and bring to light the USD/CHF pair as well. As the USD/CHF continued to decline, the EUR/USD continued to rise. We effectively have a cross over of the two pairs and research indicates that when this occurs we could see a move. As of right now according to the EJ method, I do see a reversal arrow on both those pairs. EUR/USD pointing down and crossing the 8SMA, and the USD/CHF point up and crossing the 8SMA. IBO, I think you make reference in your notes that it may be best to wait for at least two bars to cross over the line before entry to confirm the reversal. Also, I have a hypothetical question: Lets say I were to enter into a short trade of the EUR/USD pair. Price is currently 1.2567. The long term Stoch is at 94, but the short term Stoch is at 10. For a better entry would it be best to wait for that Short term Stoch to rise up before shorting? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #174 ---
ForexMike, Please refer to page 2 of EJ_4H Part I:" Two close is better and three is a charm. " Let's tell you again that please don'y play with old indicators so much, they are misleading and really never will show you the way that price will go. Theoritically your hypothesis is right and wise. we use small time periods to enter better place but in practice this is so far. All what I am trying to do is to show you how you can trade forex without any disruption in your life. By the way that you'r talking we should monitor the market all day long that is one of the worst works that I've ever seen. Eacj strategy needs a proper timing, you need just utmost 3/4 checks during day and even can manage positions very professionally than this and update one time each day. This is final goal that I guess private members can reach in a year. Happy trading, Ibo

Hi Ibo, No need to apologize for the long post. I think we are all very thankful you are sharing your method and knowledge with us, so the more information, the better... Based on the fact that you took (or would have taken) the last LONG trade in your 'eur02.gif' screen shot, where the 8SMA was above the 55SMA by a decent margin, I am assuming the EJ_4H system does allow such trades, within certain circumstances (e.g. a strongly trending market). I was confused about this previously, as your PDF #1 states that going LONG with the 8SMA above the 55SMA is not worth the risk... As you said, nothing is for sure in Forex and much depends on the trader's experience, the tone of the market, etc. so these types of trades must be evaluated within the broader context of the financial instrument. I'm looking forward to hearing more about your mentoring/private forum plans when you have them ready as it seems you have much to share. Regards, Ian

iboersma, Little by little I will explain the setups/triggers and other instruments that we should use to enter a position,we just started with the best entry setup to have a good starting and it has its own conditions. Other setups also have their own characteristics and surely instruments to be recognized. remember that I told price is the best indicator. firstly I told use 8/55SMA and candl colors and so on to get a signal then enter a trade. Afterward I explained how to use chart patterns or dual Stoch to get ready and enter with posing orders; I will make it more explicit in weeks,you will see that in last steps you will use the best setup just as a prompt being ready signal or a confirmation for a confluence of signals and events. I believe that lessons for public especially in such issues (trading) is not so effective, because we neglect knowledge, psychological aspects and many factors that I can not discuss here in advance. Again I repeat that as you see this is enough for you to make money, but if you want to be a very powerful professional in trading you should try hard and much. I want to design a plan to help members design their own methods using their personality and condition, so they will be powerful persons that can trade and get adapted to any market. If somebody claim that he/she can do this by pubic lessons I guess it is not fair. About private mentoring, it is not still 100%, you should keep in mind that this is very strict work and should be regarded carefully. It won't be a forum as I told it is impossible to help traders with same treatment. Each person should do his/her own exercises and the help is completely fitted to his/her level and knowledge. There will be a pretest and a questionnaire to get familiar with the member. Some questions may be asked extraordinary. The instrument mostly will be emailing or maybe chatting in case of being necessary. Yours, Ibo

Ibo, I was wondering if the Pivate mentoring was going to be by email, a web site or a seperate forum?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
IBO, Your thoughts: Last evening it appears we had reversal on the EUR/USD. Two red arrows appeared and were below the 8SMA. The overall trend is up here. I took a short was stopped out as the price subsequently raced to new highs. I noticed a blue arrow this morning, but that is now gone. Would you have taken that trade…? Since the trend was up on the weekly chart would you look only to go long? Or would you primarily look at current price movements? Thoughts appreciated.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
additionForexMike, You have to wait until the bar closes to get the 'correct' signal [re; the blue bar] and in my view the euro price was held up by the Weekly Pivot Points. IMHO bluemoon

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thanks for the feedback and for the chart! MIke

I just started experimenting with this system, but in back testing I've been putting my stops above the high/low of the trend. In this case, I'd have put my stop a few pips above the high of the 12:00 candle on 5/1 (1.2688). And I've been putting my limit at least as far as my stop. So far the results are very encouraging, but again this is just in back testing and I am very new to the system.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
That is good to put the stop. But keep in mind that the EUR is VERY strong right now, and you need to pay attention to news and what the banks are saying. DailyFX.com is a great source for that. They are saying that the EURUSD could go to 1.2750 - 1.2800......that would blow right past that stop! Just a thought

--- 帖子 #184 ---
That's what scares me about this system! I'm primarily a trend follower. The fact that this system is more of a "reversal spotter" got my attention. But I'm with you. I don't think I would consider a significant short trade against the EUR/USD right now.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hey I shorted the EUR this mourning at 5 am, but for 50 PIPS. I am all about the reversals also. But I time my trades...... I monitor my trades very carefully

Dear Traders, I think the reversal day that you are looking for will be Friday ,many of members are striving to catch the reversal but it has its own rules. I know that Tunnel trading strategy and VWB show a very good reversal but you are rash and can not catch this by 1/2 general rules. They are very good strategies and I appreciate them but timing...Please see the attachment. Rgds, Ibo

OK folks, In order to set up MT4 to work with the EJ_4H system, you need to: 1) Download ALL indicators, place them in your "Indicators" folder. 2) Open up each and every one of the indicators you downloaded via the MetaEditor (exclamation mark icon in top menu bar) in MT4. Save and compile each. This is key as they will not work unless you compile them. 3) Download all templates and put them in your main "Templates" folder. 4) Open up the currency charts you want to look at. 5) In each chart, go to the menu bar at the top of MT4 and click the "Charts" menu. From their select "Templates". You should see the EJ_4H templates you downloaded there. If not, select "Load Template" from the context menu and search for them. 6) Once you select the template you want (e.g.: EJ_4H_Dual_Stoch, etc.) the chart will change to show the colored bars and other indicator-related information. If you don't see some of the indicators, like the 4H countdown timer, go to the Indicators icon (green plus sign) on the top menu bar and then select the indicator you want to add. Much of the confusion about this lies with the fact that people don't realize that the indicators are loaded WITH the template. Hope this helps, Ian

--- 帖子 #197 ---
think the EURUSD reversal may have just begun. will wait for the arrow though. In terms of TPs with the EJ_4H system, what are people using. One could be the first green candle? Also, can anyone help me place vegas-type fibs on MT4? I'm having trouble placing them on the chart. Would also apreciate anyone else's backtesting particularly on cable.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
i assuming you are trying to put fibo lines around 55 SMA here, right? i was trying to do the same on my other charts, too, and just ended up using envelopes instead. but according with what Ibo teaches, he wants us to use different targets in his system. my understanding is that if you want to really get into the creator's vision, it is better to use a complete set of his recommendations. i found recently in one of the books about forex: first, you have to learn the rules, then you have to play by the rules, then you have to win by the rules, and only after that you can change the rules. although, myself i am always starting with breaking the rules and very often paying the price for that. cheers

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Thank you everyone for the conversation about the Euro/Usd it has been very helpful. I have been wondering about where to place stops and profit targets also for this system.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
H2M, This is outlined in the pdf. When I was first starting out in FX, I was constantly looking for indicators and others to place my SL's and TP's. (I'm not indicating that you are doing this but many typically look in this direction) In the guide, he outlines where to put the stops and gives a generous listing of ideas to use for profits such as fibos, wp's/mp's, trendline direction, etc. Maybe this will be of enrichment for some. Cheers to all, K P.s. Please take a look at the Eur/Usd (or others) with the 'WP Template' and zoom out a bit. On the EUR/USD, you'll see lots of activity (various resistance/support) around the pivot and midpivot 3. When a "correction" comes, I'd 1st look at the pivot as a TP and then on down.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Ktrade, Thanks a bunch. I will take a look. Holler2me

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Mind you pivots change all the time as well as fibos. See now if you were to put a fib on the EUR/USD from the 4/14 move, you'll see the 38 retracement is sitting beautifully on S1. This is another great location to keep an eye on. Of course this all provided that there isn't a major increase in the pair. (Although there will be most likely another great area such as this one is presenting) And don't forget to keep an eye on the price retracement levels back to the 55MA. Cheers, K

Hello all The 3rd document will be published during the next week, very likely before weekend. Watch out for reversal on Friday (there is nothing 100% in trading, just this is a potential of reversing) Have a nice day Ibo

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi Ibo, Are you basing your reversal prediction for Friday on the extreme oversold status of the USD combining with the institutional position squaring that takes place on Fridays? If not, can you share with us your rationale? Thanks, Ian

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hello iboersma I have some rationales, but as you see market does not act technical, if it does not reverse I really get confused, I did not get really what did you mean, you can send me your detail by email, this is a very simple trick than you can learn after some experience, I may publish it in upcoming parts but definitly will talk more about timing for private members, this is a part that needs to be discussed based on knowledge of the member Have a nice day, Ibo

Watch out for reversal on Friday (there is nothing 100% in trading, just this is a potential of reversing) Are looking at the 4h chart and which pairs? Johnny

--- 帖子 #207 ---
You don't need to monitor the price, you should find a good point to place your orders, reversal is about the majors. Still momentum is high and as you are hearing form media and some professionals some moves of the price is out of phase (non-technical without any solid reason), I personally am waiting for backing to the harmony. This on the basis of my thoughts is happen Saturday, so as that is off then we may have the reversal Friday or Monday. But nothing is 100%. Let's see. Our method is on H4, for controling your account at the time you should eye H4 chart, but for better entry or exit in the hours that momentum (speed) of price is high you can go down to H1 and do precisely what you need. Best, Ibo

Hello eurusdtrader, So far I have found your thread of interest. I have a couple of things I want to know more about and would be grateful for an answer:- 1. What is the cost of your private tuition group. 2. Do you have any solid evidence you can show that this trading method is profitable for example a brokers statement. Thanks for your contributions, volvo

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hello volvo, Thank you too for your kindness. This is a program that needs that you follow it for an enough period of time, it depends on the level of trader. Again I repeat that I still have not taken a 100% decision. Because it is not a goal for making money. If I wanted to make money I could sell this info that I contribute freely for thousands of dollars. I just want to have a handful of traders to make a very good community and have a good plan in mind to construct a mentoring system that you have not seen so far. All mentoring systems that I have seen are the same method of publishing information for public. There is not a close and very personal attention to the trader. You should not be apprehensive about the tuition because I will put two different level of mentoring for different level of traders. One will be enough cheap, in fact nothing in the world of traders. Traders show their performance just in some cases that they will manage funds. As I have told before, there could be traders even very newbies that can make money maybe better than me with this method. You can test it yourself and you can see that with some attention to the trading principles and discipline you can have a decent income. It is a gift from me. If you want that I give you signals, it is easy, just tell me that I can tell you what you should buy or sell. As a trader you should stand on your feet. There will be cases that I am wrong but you are thinking of a right direction. I still learn. I think with 50 years of study we can not get complete understanding of the market. I were very busy this week and will be more avaiable hereafter, wait for the third part this week. Have a nice weekend, Ibo

Ibo, I am trying to monitor several pairs with EJ4 method - most majors and several crosses. As of now (after the big Friday), all the majors are not ready for reversal and only Japanese crosses - GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY will go down after the rising wedge will break. Would you agree with that? Thanks.

zzz, Usually the price action of Mondays is a determining of weekly direction. Let's see this Monday. JPY related pairs have their own behavior. Most of time EUR,GBP and CHF (conversely) have the same or very similar action.Detailed info will be in a certain topic. Best, Ibo

Dear Friends, Unbelievably I finished the third part very sooner. You can get it from the first post. Best, Ibo

--- 帖子 #217 ---
IBO, Looking for an opportunity to learn from your analysis, so I attached a chart of the EUR/JPY and would like your feedback. The weekly trend on this pair is up; however, we had a major down trend in price on Friday. One can clearly see on the attached chart that the price blew through 8SMA (white line) as well as the support level 1, but it did not break support level 2. I missed this opportunity. The 55SMA which shows the main sentiment of the market still shows a slight bias to the upside, but is flattening. The price is now around the 55SMA. Regradless of the fact that the weekly trend is up, the 8 SMA is now sloping downward with a negative bias. If I understand your method correctly, I would be looking for an opportunity to go short, however, we are at the 55SMA and the support level 2 is not that far off. I do not really see a good opportunity here. If I see a green buy arrow (which we might if the price bounces off of the 55 or 2nd support level and retraces) I would not take the trade due to the fact that the risk reward it too great. The 8SMA is still above the 55SMA. According to your method, I really see two primary trade signals. Primary Long: 8SMA is Below 55SMA: Look for slope to turn positive and you get a green arrow Primary Short: 8SMA is ABOVE 55SMA: Look for slope to turn negative and look for a red arrow. In an situation where the 8SMA is ABOVE 55SMA (in the case of a long trade) and the trend is up would you look to buy on recent pullbacks? Perhaps not as a primary trade, but perhaps a secondary with a lower trade size? One may miss the initial primary trade signal and although the 8 has crossed the 55, there could still be considerable upside if the trend is in that direction. Would you agree? I am wondering if you can outline your primary and secondary (if applicable) trade signals again. Thoughts on this and/or additional analysis techniques welcome and appreciated. Mike

--- 帖子 #218 ---
IBO, A follow-up to my last message. This is a view of the EUR/USD 4-hour chart.A nice uptrend is evident. In the chart I drew attention to the most recent blew buy signal arrow. Although the 8SMA is above the 55SMA, would a long trade be entered here. I also follow the Vegas Wealth Building system, and this pair is trading at it most extreme fib level and keeping an eye at a potential reversal of the trend. Looking at the most recent trading price, one could make the argument that the trend will continue, and why not jump in and go long? Using the pivot points as a means of additional analysis, the first resistance level (R1) appears to me the major resistance level on both the daily and weekly charts. Any thoughts here... Thanks MIke

--- 帖子 #219 ---
hey ForexMike, how can you enter in the long trade in your last post if EUR/USD is at the end of the huge long run and everybody waits for it to reverse down?According to what I see, it may spyke a little bit up and then reverse down big time. This is where you have to enter if you want a fat profit. Cheers

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I agree, I am not buying, but just posted it to get feedback on this or any other pair where the 8SMA might be above the 55SMA. MIke

ForexMike, About EURJPY chart : Lots of issues needs to be discussed. 1- I will do the same exercises for private members, in fact they do like you and we will discuss. 2- I just tell you some that hope will help. - A long range candle often means non-technical market, or a vey important news or rumour and so on. Simply, stand aside. - Mondays and Fridays as the starting and finishing of the weekly business round are a little different form the rest. In fact they have its own characteristics. Shortly, Stand aside Mondays and look for a breakout/down at the end of session (most of time eauropean) - You were right about the majority of your talk. But Preferably you should get the direction by two stop orders (buy and sell) - At the time completely forget about the weekly trend, because it is very long time scale About EURUSD: One very simple but important rule, when you expect a reversal (I see as VWB here that all of kids look for) and it does not happen it means the trend is very strong and you should follow the trend. I will discuss in detail in the future. Have a nice weekend Ibo

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I have to add when we are in such situations (expecting reversal never happen and the trend continues) the best strategy to trade is to focus on day trading skills. I won't talk about this skills in this thread or in my documents beause it is not included.Just I will discuss with private members on the basis of need-to-know. So it depends on your ability to seize enough pips when you know the direction and this matter that the tred is strong enough. This is one of the easiest set-ups that you can trade. because price trends with daily steps. You should just take the daily projections. In fact this is the only condition that you can rely on daytrading and trend following dasics. Yours, Ibo

Looks like there was a potential reversal this morning on the AUD/USD, but the Reserve Banks increased interest rates to 5.75% from5.5% to curb inflationary pressure which helped move the AUD higher against the USD. Commodity prices trend will be important in the Short Term which if they remain strong will offer some near-term Aussie support. There seems to be a weaker capital flow into this currency which may prevent further AUD gains. The EUR, last time I check my charts this morning continued its run up – trend is still strong.. Mike

ForexMile, Thanks for your commentary. But seems you have forgotten the blue color coding. The next day is determining. today was bearish. Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Sorry about that You are correct! I am looking at the EUR chart and it did retrace, but the 55SMA and the long term Stoch are still pointing to an upward trend. Do we have a reveral are just a pullback? That is the question...we will have to wait and see... Mike

--- 帖子 #229 ---
ForexMike, This is the most important and popular and frequent question in both swing trading and reversal trading method. There are methods and tricks to see this. But totally you should get a confirmation, so look at the chart and first support to ruin. PS: You can change the color to blue (edit you previous post) Totally in this cases rely on the most reliable indicator (price) Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #230 ---
My opinon, any comments welcome

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Thanks IBO, Here is a most recent chart of the EUR/USD. Price did decline and is approaching the first pivot support level. The 55SMA still looks very positive and long term Stoch still very high. Let's see if the trend continues and the pair moves back-up. Will wait for the blue arrow for confirmation... Mike

--- 帖子 #232 ---
GBPUSD is similar to Euro but did not break the 50% retracement, no momentum is still a concern. AUDUSD looks a better move but still has some S/R issues, (but I did get in last night) I think the market may stay slow until the FOMC tommorow night

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Good feedback Lindsay...the pair could break lower to the 23 retracement - below that, I am not so sure due to the stong trend this pair has shown recently. We shall see... Thanks

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I agree with you

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Dear Friends, As you see in majors we are in the zone that price violates drastically and there are many misleading signals, this is because at the time price is errant and it should go higher or lower to confirm the direstion, as we are expecting the sell-off market eur should break through 1.2260 to confirm the reversal, otherwise we get assured that the uptrend is very strong. Untill now the reversal of Saturday (Monday) that I talk about is going to be confirmed. There are methods that we can recognize this zone, it is done using fibo and PP and some other patterns. Will be covered some in future and completely for private members. Happy trading, Ibo

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Ibo, Thanks for sharing your system with us. I am trying to learn how you trade with it. Could you explain how you decided on 1.2260 as the point to confirm the reversal. Why can't we use a break of 1.2650 or 1.2550 on EUR/USD as confirmation? Thanks

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thanks IBO, I will try to follow up with a chart later this evening or this weekend, but this morning, I did place a buy trade on the EUR/USD. Although the 8SMA was above the 55SMA, the price retraced a bit, and I felt, by anlayzing the slope of the 55, that the uptrend was very strong and would continue. The price declined right at the S1 pivot level and that is where I bought. The 4-hour Stoch also pointed to an uptrend. I just closed the trade with a 83 PIP gain... Regards, Mike

Mike, You were aggressive, I hope you were not exhausted that force some traders to go amok, it was a nice gain but I think you risked too much. This is a game of waiting at the time, please don't lose the game easily. We have crosses that look better to be eyed. Ibo

--- 帖子 #241 ---
bigballer, I have mentionned this I think before that totally forget about fundamental when you are using enough big time frames. Just some news can make flurries on market. Fundamental for stocks are so important. But when using enough technical instruments you just need to know if there is a very important news on the way? If yes you just take care otherwise they will mislead you. It is joky that some sites drastically want to interpret moves with fundamentals. Really it is not possible that for such trading types you indicate proper and exact levels to enter, to exit and to pose oders or stops. They are totally interpretable, means that good for nothing in practice. In other words, this is like mass and energy, in astronomical speeds, mass and energy are the same things. You are expecting a sell-off regarding GDP, on the chart you find a reversal pattern like double top. These are the same. I can read your mind that you now have a question: So we can nicely use the fundamental at least as a confirmation or a part of our strategy. In fact, theoritically you are right. But what about if you know that these are some that know the figures or tamper with them for many reasons? So thiese are the cases that you will lose just because of regarding intensively to fundamental. Remember that I told PRICE IS THE BEST INDICATOR. Because no body can cheat on it. I hope this helps, it's my personal opinion and any other suggestion or opinion is respectable. Happy trading, Ibo

Hi Ibo, In a previous post you showed an entry using a 123 chart a pattern as a confirmation entry. I was wondering if you have an opinion on which of the patterns work best as an entry or exit tool. Thanks Lindsay

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Lindsay, Patterns are the most reliable tools; some will be covered in the thread and detailed tricks will be published for private members regarding their basic knowledge. Detailed info confuse and dissapoint newbies, and simple do the same for experienced. Different education system is a need. But I think I will write some examples of 123 pattern to confirm the entry in the next part. Rgds, Ibo

I believe that the USD is still likely to continue down. For that reason I would not like to enter any trades long USD. I would rather miss some trades or trade with the trend until I get a real swing up from the dollar. The USD CHF is a good example of a tempting trade long USD that I choose for the time being to stay out of or short with the trend the next turn. Any comments welcome

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I've been faked out several times already by apparent pin bars. The best one was GBPUSD on 5/1. It hit my stop almost 5 pips exactly below the pin bar and then shot up to my stoploss. That was annoying. Of course, now the reversal signs are getting pretty clear. I don't think there is any dollar weakness left that hasn't been taken care of by this long anti-dollar trend. However, I'd say the market is sideways now. Most pairs haven't hit their major trendlines yet. I think I'll just buy low and sell high for a while. What's weird is that it looks like every single pair has reversal signals, even the ones that have nothing to do with the dollar. I like that EURGBP is going up; That's a much-needed correction.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hello, As many these days waiting for a reversal, I prefered to attach these snaps. As I told in previous posts, we should get a confirmation, just some pips of swoon can not determine that the reversal is in place.The first one (eur1) is H4 illustrates that we have a good channel and any breakout and close beyind the support of the channel and BEYOND YELLOW LINE could be a confirmation. look at the next picture (eur2) that is daily chart showing how the trend is decent, look at the swings and the retraces to the white line. the first support (that is stop loss for buyers) should break that we get enter short. Who could tell that how we can get a confirmation sooner that dont lose many initial pips of reversal trend? Rgds, Ibo

IBO, Thanks for the charts – they were very helpful to look at. In addition, I enjoyed reading part III. I will take a stab at your question regarding how one might get a confirmation sooner rather waiting for the price to break out of the channel. Although it would be best to wait until it did break the channel, one potential method is to study and understand price action and price bar analysis. One of the most important things the market can do during a trading day is to continue along the path of either hitting new highs or new lows for the day. This would also include assessing the speed and momentum of the price movement. This in conjunction with support and resistance may provide an early insight of a change in direction. Of course you also use proper trade entry techniques, tight stops and trailing stops if you think a reversal is taking place prior to the pricing breaking out of the channel. Mike

IBO, I posted a 4-H chart of the EUR/USD. You are going to yell at me again for being aggressive, but thought I would post my thought process and gain your feedback again. One can clearly see the purple arrows point to a downward trend – we had three price bars to the downside, but analyzing the price bars, I could see that the strength of that downturn was losing steam. Price hit the bottom channel and moved upward – then we got the blue buy arrow. Blue buy arrow, price losing momentum to the downside, failure to break the channel, and strong trend up. I bought the pair at at the blue upward arrow, and closed the position out at 1.2810 for a 97 pip gain. This seemed to be what you were eluding to in Part III - re-entry techniques? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hello Mike and Kids, Being aggressive is so good in cases that you take big profits with very tight stop ranges. I never yell at you of being aggressive, I just want to tell that you all, should respect your discipline and have reasons to enter. Reentering includs many methods, one is 123 pattern that is my favorite pattern. I will talk about this in upcoming parts but for private members in advance. Have a nice weekend, Ibo

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Enjoy the weekend as well, Take Care, Mike

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Ibo and others, Thanks so much for sharing this incredible information. I've just started to look at it and do my due diligence, but I have to say I'm very impressed and excited to learn more. Hopefully I can catch up my reading over the weekend and setup MT4 so that I can really follow along with the flow of the thread. Cope

Hello all, About the private mentoring I can not post here, if anybody is interested in please email me at [size=3][color=deepskyblue][b]ejeddi@gmail.com[/b][/color][/size] . Rgds, Ibo

Hello e-u-trader, hello all, unfortunatly i didn't manage to go through all postings and wondered, if anybody could - besides they are maybe already answered somewhere - give me a hand on those followin' questions, please. #1 In the first postin', there are EJ_4H_Methode_Part_I to III published. Am i supposed to use them all, are there different or is the last one the up-to-date version? #2 Is there any aqustic notification (possible), if metatrader in compination with those indicators finds a good entry point? #3 Is there any e-mail notification available? Since those entry points seem not to be so often, i'd rather would have an SMS-Alertion on my cellular than a chart i need to watch. An E-Mail would be redirected to my handy. #4 What's the users experience with that system so far? Does it work good, is it complicated or as easy to use as it seems like? Best regards and great respect for the work you've done. Please apologize, if i burst in the middle of a thread with those question. I'm just curious, 'cause it seems to me like i've maybe missed an interestin' candy in this forum i'd like to explore asap. best regards, Tony

--- 帖子 #259 ---
eurusdtrader has been very generous in showing everyone this nice system and has answered everyones questions. I think Ibo deserves to have the right to tell people he offers private training. Please email him for more information at ejeddi@gmail.com I would like to thank you Ibo for your fantastic contribution... Thanks Scott Sorry I do not know what color the type is supposed to be...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hello Tony, You'r welcome! The documents are parts of the method, not updated versions so you should read all them respectively. Please read the initial posts that get a closer acquaintance with the method, I can not judge how is the method. You are looking for a service rather than a method, so if you want to get signals easily try some and when you are satisfied register. This is a basical method and could be modified for the life style/taste of most of people. So accept the this gift and just try a bit, then you will find out what you should in time. Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Somebody needs to code an EA for this system. Or a alert for entries that will email you.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I can help to write the first draft but I need to be clear on the rules: 1) do we buy/sell immediately after arrow appears or should we wait until the bar closes? 2) should we use value of the arrow as stoploss or some other more reliable values? 3) what are the best pp or fibo levels should we use for taking profit? 4) is it a good exit stratety if we simply reverse the trade when the arrow in the opposite direction occurs? If I get clear answers to those questions, I should be able to write the EA.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
1)you should wait. 2)arrow is just a confirmation, there is no value for it. 3)you should trail the price then we have targets, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on. 4)No, you should wait for closing the bar with a contrary arrow. Good luck Ibo

Dear All, Private mentoring is not the end of this thread, I don't know why friends stopped posting. Maybe they are trying to discover new opportunities and new direction of the market this week. Look at the recent chart of eurusd, the main direction is up. The first main support is yellow line. If it breaks the price very likely will swoon or at least will flatten. any close above white line is esteemed a continuation indication and we can rebuy. Please check the PPs and fibo numbers. It will give you more indications. For better execution if you know H1 suitable indicators try them too. Have profitable week, Ibo

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thanks IBO for the chart… I have also attached a view of the 4-Hour chart of the EUR/USD Pair. Later last week, the price broke out of its current channel, but today it came back in. The green trend lines on my chart indicate the current channel. It analyzing the price action, it looks like the price is loosing some steam as it approaches the bottom of the channel and as the price retraced to the 61.8% Fibonacci level. The 4-H Stoch on is also very oversold (currently at 11.85) and as you indicated the trend is still very strong. I am waiting to see what happens, but looking out for a potential buying opportunity. Mike

--- 帖子 #266 ---
A view of the GBP/USD 4-Hour Chart… Look at the strong trend up and you can clearly see the nice channel. The price is approaching the bottom of the channel (the green line). The 4-H Stoch is also very oversold at 11.44. Will this pair bounce off of the bottom channel and move back up – thus presenting a possible buying opportunity? Something to keep an eye on… Mike

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Here is an updated chart of the EUR/USD as of this morning here on the east coast. The price did get a slight lift, but still in a bearish configuration. It has not closed below the green trendline. I do not have a position in this pair at the present time, but would be a buyer if I get the confirmation since the trend is still up. Mike

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Mike, You should regard the close below yellow line and look at the 3 recent bars that altogether they are bearish but STO is rising. Ibo

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Thanks IBO... You mentioned that if the price closed above the white line...that is the point for which to look for an opportunity to get back in and buy if the trend is up - correct? Mike

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Mike, The violance of the oil and gold prices had the influence on majors. It is an errant price at the time and nobody can tell the right direction, but a breakout/down is very likely in case of breaking the nearest support or resistance. This is a situation that you should think smaller time periods, in fact try to close your positions before reversing. Look at the H1 time frame. 55SMA is the resistance that is the final barrier for eur. But Making a new high is a harder work, if it can not then falls will occur and maybe we have some surge and tests. In this market the high and low of days and their breaking is so important. Most of the time they indicate the direction of the whole day. In other word when the low of the yesterday breaks then we should think short. Of course 55/8SMA are not the suitable MA for H1 chart. I will talk later on about the best MAs shortly in the thread and in advance for private members. Ibo

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Ibo, Looking at the latest GBP 4H chart, it made a small bounce from yesterday's sell off but seemingly met with strong resistance at the blue 38.2 fib level. I think there is a good chance for GBP to re-test yesterday's low. If successful, it should go all the way down to the green 38.2 fib line (below 1.86). What do you think? chinplant

--- 帖子 #272 ---
reduced activity probably due to the fact that for the past 3 weeks, the eagerly expected retracements only lasted 1 day yesterday. i must admit that there have been few trading opportunities since this thread started but lets hope the great setup will come soon which would give followers a chance to see the powerful money making method. be patient folks....

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Just wanted to add that I have been following your methods, and will continue too. Thanks for the great contribution.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
IBO, Attached is a current snapshot of the EUR/USD at 8:15 p.m EST. I currently do not have any open positions. I am analyzing this pair to determine a re-entry point. Here is my thought process – let me know if you agree or if you would approach this differently. The most recent blue arrow indicates a buying opportunity; however, we do not just jump in. In the case of this pair, I would feel comfortable buying this pair since the trend is still up and have not really seen any strong indication of a major reversal. I have found that I am more comfortable buying in this case if the short term stochastic is below the 20 range. In this view, we are currently at 73. For added analysis: the dark orange lines are that of a detrended price oscillator (custom indicator for MT4), which visually shows when the price will become overbought or oversold. I think that this indicator may provide a more accurate view of the overbought/oversold levels. Also just analyzing the current price of the last two bars, the price looks weak, but then again it is just the opening of the Asian markets. So from my view, I would buy only, but looking at this chart right now, I do not see a good entry point. Feel free to add anything… Thanks! Mike

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Mike, Wait to jump in until the CPI numbers tomorrow........ Or any trades OUT before numbers released..

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Good point! I think I will do that... Thanks, Mike

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hello all, Regarding biballer and Mike's discussion I have to tell you that: 1- Such indicators that make bands to show overybought/sold levels are useful for the hours of market that is not in a strong momentum and just sideways. You can easily use BB(Bollinger Bands) to buy at lower band and sell at higher band aiming few pips when price sideways. I tried this when I was a newbie and it worked. You can see the Vegas fib lines, why it is almost a month that don't work? Because it is not for a strong trending market. Of course on the basis of the strategy with that you should wait until market reverse and shows enough reversal indications. 2-Most of time market waits for a catalyst. Usually this is fundamental. In fact I am agree with bigballer, but keep in mind that its extent is day trading till a new trend in longer time frames forms. Mike you have a good common sens of the market. This is one of the best things that a trader could have. PS: I am sorry that I can not discuss most of the time in advance about the price action of the day. It is not included in my program for the thread.In fact it needs some prerequisits that is included in private mentoring. This is a long way that private members will be involved. Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Dear Members, I don't have a good feeling about the rating of this thread that in recent days somebody had a very negative opinion about the rating. It is some days that this irrtates me. It could be nice if I know what was the flaw of the thread? So if that/those guys tell me about that I should be very thankful. And members that had not any vote, please vote now. This may change my mind. Yours, Ibo

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Sure, I just voted, and voted way up for you Ibo. I would like to find out more about you and your history in the trading markets also!! But so far, anyone with negative remarks about you is just childish..... Dont let it bother you Ibo.... thanks

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I voted it high. Over the last 4 days or so I have read thorugh all the postings in this thread and am surprised that all this detailed information has been provided for free, this is not something we are used to seeing this day in age. I wouldn't worry about what a couple of people rate the thread knowing how mcuh positive feedback you have recevied.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I have been here since the start, although I have just been just reading, you have helped me a great deal. I appreciate it and every post that is here. I wouldn't understand why someone would be negative about you providing such good info. I for one have to say thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I've never rated a thread. If it's important, I'll rate this thread highly. This is one of what I think of as "golden threads" like the james16 or VWB threads, where people reveal their vast experience.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Ibo You will never please all the people all the time. I think you will be pleasing alot of people alot of the time. Keep up the good work, although I am someone who reads alot and does not really say much I think this thread is great.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
big yes to ibo.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
This is excellent thread. Thanks Ibo for started this thread and generously share you knowledge to all of us here. I really appreciate it. Just keep going man, I vote excellent for you! Happy trading all!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hah, I didn't notice that there's a tiny rating system at the bottom. This must be some kind of plug-in I voted for you.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
i made 20 pip profit by selling GBPUSD before european open - good exit otherwise it could be very painful. now with gold price goes above 700 again, GBP is gaining some strength but as long as it doesn't break the magic 1.9000 it could be simply a double top.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
what is the best 3-4 pair to trade with this sistem ?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Ibo, I only stumbled on to this thread last night and started reading it with great interest! I am a noob....no wait, let me re-phrase that...I am a SUPER NOOB and not ashamed of it, cause we all got to start somewhere. There are going to be lots of newbies like me stumbling onto this thread as time progresses and I am sure that they will appreciate your efforts as much as I do, from the little I have read on this thread support seems plentyful. Last night I only managed to read upto page 10 of this thread so am not quite sure what you are refering to (but believe me I will get there eventually ), but if you have been getting negative critisism and it is bothering you, rather concentrate on the comments made by those that are positively supporting you, and there seem to be many. You obviously started this thread to help people and quite frankly if all one's efforts turn out to only help one person in this entire world then those efforts have been worth it. Continue to support those that want it and let the others go. Enough already, before I depress myself. Now, where do I go to vote cause I can't find it . Just to say, I printed out your pdf's today and am heading off to read them now. Thanks again for all your efforts and hope to find the support when I return here after taking those lessons apart and putting them back together again. Good luck to all out there, Sage.

Hello Friends, Thank you all for your kindness. It seems that funnily many don't know where is the voting instrument. You can find that feature just below the page. You can see 5 starts. This shows the rating. If you click on it you can now vote. Everyday new members jump in and are rash to read everything in the thread. I don't blame them because it is a little strange and very interestig that they come across with something that they have looked everyday. You are welcome buds, BUT PLEASE READ THE FIRST PAGE CAREFULLY AND TRY TO RESPECT THE RULES . I see that some of our kids forget to color-code their texts about the daily talks about price action. Anyway the only thing that is perfect is God adn the other have their own flaws. I have a talk to newbies, Please don't shy to post or ask questions. I have gone in your shoes before,there is no dumb question. Fortunately this thread's members are of the very kind and generous members of the FF. ATB, Ibo

--- 帖子 #291 ---
as ibo is so generous in creating the thread to help all of us, i gave up a large portion of my sleep last night by creating this EA with following rules: 1) buy/sell at the current bar if a EJ_4H signal appears at the previous bar 2) exit if specified takeprofit/stoploss reached or reverse the order when opposite arrow appears hope other members can help me to test it. i attach the executable for now but if other members can provide some constructive feedbacks, i could consider to put the source code so that we could all work together to improve the EA. chinplant

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I just voted Thank you Senbanda

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Default settings?? thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
chinplant, shouldn't we have the buy/sell at next bar above the high/low of the signal bar since most times the next bar is typically a mini-correction bar? Thanks for your work. Oh, and by the way, I've always felt the rating system and # of posts should be done away with on these threads.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
default settings should work just fine although you can put your own stoploss or takeprofit if you wish. feel free to backtest it.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
good point, currently the EA trades immediately after the signal bar closes. what i could do is add an option so users can either trade at openning of new bar or follow your suggested strategy of placing stop orders upon breakout of high/low of previous bar.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Good idea.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
there was no MQ file in the download?????

--- 帖子 #299 ---
chinplant said he was only attaching the executable file at this time. You don't need the MQ file to try it out and provide feedback.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
It would be nice to have the MQ4 file so we could "look under the hood" to see the logic Chinplant is using in the EA...

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Well - I believe we're now seeing the long awaited reversal for the dollar... EUR/USD has fallen 200 pips in the first 4 hour bar alone. Ibo - any advice on how to trade this? We know that any unnaturally long bar needs to be dealt with in a careful manner, since a correction of such frothy trading is to be expected. The 30M chart's dual stochs are both showing oversold, while the 4H chart's stochs are heading down from overbought. My personal tack would be to wait until the price has corrected up (and the 30M stochs are back at 'overbought') then go short... - Ian

--- 帖子 #302 ---
agreed. lets sell on strength! the next a few bars will be critical, but since it has broken the yellow line, you can't go much wrong if you sell near the yellow 55sma line. of course, if you're an agreesive type, you could sell earlier.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
No doubt. I'm more of the conservative type (with my money, at least) so I'm going to hold out until I see some decent retracing back up. If it retraces back to the 38% Fib from this morning's 200-pip drop, that would end up being right around the 55SMA at approx. 1.2785... The test is if the price breaks the S1 pivot level since that is now resistance... In addition, there will be a lot of anxious sellers who've been waiting in the wings to short the EUR so the price may not get there, but like you said, only the next few bars will tell. - Ian

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hello After days now there is close below yellow line. I just add one thing to iboersma's comment. There are differences between supports and resistances regarding their importance. In fact they have types. Here price found a support at S1 weekly and is going to make a retrace. But any bounce does not means sell-off market. I have told this days ago. KEY LEVEL is 1.2660. I don't discuss why and how we should find the key levels, because it refers to the types of the sup/resis. Totally Ian has a good common sens of the market. SO, buyers look at close again above yellow line and sellers will be confirmed by any close below 1.2660. SO the zone between 1.2660 and 1.2690 is the errancy zone and each execution in this is not recommended. In fact you should watch out your positions when price is in this area to close in time if you see reversing signs. Chinplat, well done. I think it is better that you give some explanation on how the kids should use this and what are the parameters. If you don't like to publish it for public and just want to work with some programmers let me know then I will make an environment that you can complete it. Good trading, Ibo

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Ibo, Thanks for the insight. We will keep close eye on 1.2660 which is about 100 pips away. Also note that the angle of yellow is about to turn south. I have no problem to make it public as I'm a firm believer of knowledge sharing. It's my intention to work together to improve the EA so we will all be laughing to the bank. I attached it now to this thread. Any corrections, suggestions or enhancements by other co-traders will be most welcome. However, I do want to keep track of changes to avoid having too many versions flying around which severs no good to the method itself. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
chinplant, Thanks very much for the indicator. I tried to apply this to the chart, but it does not appear to work. Are you having this trouble as well? Thanks MIke

--- 帖子 #307 ---
IBO, I have a question...as an example, take a look at the attached GBP/USD chart. This is a 1-hour chart which shows a blue buy signal arrow. On the 4-hour chart, no blue arrow exists but the price action appears to be up at least in the immediate short term. Can I use a 8SMA / 55SMA on the 1 hour chart? How would you analyze this particular situation? To me, it would appear that we have some bullish action after today's sell off... Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Chinplant, Thanks for your hard work on the EA for EJ_4H. It looks great to me. I'm going to put it to work on some demo accounts I've got to see what results I get. I'll keep you posted... Regards, Ian

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hello Chinplant Even I cannot attach it to my chart. Senbanda

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Senbanda and others, You're going to have to be more specific about what you are doing to attach the EA as I had no problem attaching it to my charts. I would recommend grabbing the .mq4 (source code) that Chinplant just posted, saving it to your Experts directory in the MetaTrader directory, opening it up with MetaEditor, and compiling it. Once you do this, you should be able to see it in the MetaTrader Navigator pane under "Expert Advisors". If you can provide more detail about what you're doing, that will help us to help you... - Ian

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hello Ian I saved it to my computer and then attached it to C:/ProgramFiles/MetaTrader4/Experts/Indicators. I do not know any other way. When I attached EJ_4H trend and indicator before the above method worked. Your help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you Senbanda

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hello Ian and all, Totally forget the signals on smaller time frames, 55/8SMA as I have said before does not suitable for H1. This is a topic that I will cover generally for thread members and advancely for private members. I prefered make snaps to remind you some basics. In smaller time frames when you are expecting a swing then a break you should play 123 pattern, regarding important levels like fibo, PP and H/L swings.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
This is showing that Still we don't have any close below yellow line, so it is better to watch out this more.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
A confluence of at least 4 indicator. So you can see how it could be a key level.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
This is H1 chart. We just want to see the close below white line to confirm a sell signal.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Also Ichimoku illustrates a resistance at its band. All these were not signals, this is just a comment for Ian's question. ATB, Ibo

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Senbanda, Do this: 1) Download the .mq4 file that Chinplant posted yesterday for the EJ_4H EA. You will be prompted to either Save it or Open it. Select Open. Your computer should recognize it as a MetaTrader file and open your MetaEditor automatically. 2) You will now see the source code open in your MetaEditor application. 3) At the top of MetaEditor, you will see a File menu option. Click that and select Save As. Navigate to the Experts directory in your MetaTrader directory (not Indicators). Save it there. Now go to the top menu bar of MetaEditor and click the Compile button. At the bottom of the screen you should see a message after doing this that says "no errors". 4) Close and restart your MetaTrader application. 5) Go to the Expert Advisors section of your navigator panel and you should see the EJ_4H EA there. Let me know if this doesn't work for you. - Ian

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Ibo, I don't know much about the use of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator or how it actually functions, but it looks like it is a pretty accurate indicator of support and resistance. Can you explain your method of using this in addition to pivots and Fib levels for determining trade "breakouts" from resistance and support? Thanks, Ian

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Ian, Ichimolu is good for daily and higher charts. Its bands as form precedently sometimes is not bad to be checked. Never forget your analysis. PRICE is the best indicator. Always define channels and sup/resis. Then you have a field with signs, imagine that you have a city without traffic signs, what will happen? You will get confused. A simple trend line analysis is attached. Get the complete snap in the zipped format. Rgds, Ibo

Trend Lines

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hello Ian I think I got it. Does it show a line at1.2954 and a lower line at 1.2676? Thank you very much Sebanda

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks, Ibo. Yes, I do sometimes get lost in forest with all the myriad technical indicators there are out there. Thanks for reminding me of the value of re-focusing on the basics like trend lines. Best, Ian

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Senbanda, My EA doesn't show any lines when I load it. You will know that it loaded correctly by looking at the top RIGHT portion of your chart. If you loaded it, but either do not have the "Expert Advisor" toggle button on the top menu bar selected, or do not have the "Allow Live Trading" option selected in the Properties of the EA itself, you will see a little face with a frown . If you loaded it and have set it up to allow for live trading (via the Properties of the EA) and have the Expert Advisor button selected (on the top menu bar), the smiley face will have a big smile. Are you confusing the Expert Advisor with one of the indicators by chance? - Ian

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hello Ian Yes Smily face is there. May be the lines were drawn by me to find the Support and Resistance Thank you again Senbanda

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Can someone explain to me how the STOCH chart works? I read thorugh the part of the document that talks about it and have a general understanding but I would like a better explanation, else can someone point me in the right direction. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Ibo, Looks like we are now possibly in a channel going down..... It broke lower TREND line Resistance now is 1.2875ish ?? Please verify... thanks

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I don't have much experience with this, but if you look on your metatrader chart under the help category, then Analytics, then technical indicators; there's a list of the indicators that come with metatrader and their definitions. Here is what it says about the Stochastic Oscillator - Stochastic Oscillator The Stochastic Oscillator Technical Indicator compares where a security’s price closed relative to its price range over a given time period. The Stochastic Oscillator is displayed as two lines. The main line is called %K. The second line, called %D, is a Moving Average of %K. The %K line is usually displayed as a solid line and the %D line is usually displayed as a dotted line. There are several ways to interpret a Stochastic Oscillator. Three popular methods include: Buy when the Oscillator (either %K or %D) falls below a specific level (for example, 20) and then rises above that level. Sell when the Oscillator rises above a specific level (for example, 80) and then falls below that level; Buy when the %K line rises above the %D line and sell when the %K line falls below the %D line; Look for divergences. For instance: where prices are making a series of new highs and the Stochastic Oscillator is failing to surpass its previous highs. Calculation The Stochastic Oscillator has four variables: %K periods. This is the number of time periods used in the stochastic calculation; %K Slowing Periods. This value controls the internal smoothing of %K. A value of 1 is considered a fast stochastic; a value of 3 is considered a slow stochastic; %D periods. his is the number of time periods used when calculating a moving average of %K; %D method. The method (i.e., Exponential, Simple, Smoothed, or Weighted) that is used to calculate %D. The formula for %K is: %K = (CLOSE-LOW(%K))/(HIGH(%K)-LOW(%K))*100 Where: CLOSE — is today’s closing price; LOW(%K) — is the lowest low in %K periods; HIGH(%K) — is the highest high in %K periods. The %D moving average is calculated according to the formula: %D = SMA(%K, N) Where: N — is the smoothing period; SMA — is the Simple Moving Average .

Wouldn't we have to wait until the 8 MA is above the 55 MA to even consider a sell according to the design of the indicator?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Yes it is now!!! The pivot point that now appears on the chart is only 15 pips from what I estimated.... Well I made some nice pips of it... Hope some others did too thanks

Has anyone developed an indicator that alarms when a arrow shows up on the chart?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Here is a trade I took the other day: Bought on 5/18 @ 1.5494 and sold the morning of 5/18 1.5567 for a 73 pip gain. The red and green horizontal lines on the chart designate where I entered and sold. The green arrow shows the point at which I entered – second blue bar above the 8SMA (white line). This would be a buy signal per EJ’s method as the 8SMA (which is sloping up (white line) is below the 55SMA (yellow). Although the price crossed and closed above the 55SMA, I did not wish to stay in the trade for the price movement seemed to be loosing some steam, and the 55SMA is a resistance level. I could have put a trailing stop, just in case the price keep moving up, but just took the profit. As you can see the price came right back down to the 55SMA. Mike

Could someone explain once again what this indicator does? I am also still having some issues getting this to work. I followed the instructions but still having some issues. I use other indicators for MT4, but not sure why this one is giving me trouble. Once I am in metatrader and double click on this indicator - nothing happens. Usually, a text box would appear where you can select variables then it will be applied to the chart. Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Mike, it's not an indicator but an EA for autotrading. It's saved to your "experts" file - not your "experts- indicator" file. Save. restart, open navigator, find under experts and drag to your chart. You should see a happy face w/o smile. When the markets are open , you'll see a happy face in the top right corner of your screen telling you it's operational. Oh, make sure in your options settings you've allowed "live trading". k

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks for the follow-up K. Now..I have it working! . Does this send off an alarm when the variables are met..? How is this working for those that are using it? Thanks to Chinplant for putting this together and sharing... Mike

Here is a view of the USDJPY daily chart. Clearly this pair has been is a descending channel; however, as you can see, the price broke out of the channel. The signal is a buy. I am not advocating a buy here, but using this pair as an analysis. The red line (113.33) is meant to represent the last support level back in January. The question is, can the price get there? A view of the 4-hour chart is next..

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The price crossed above the yellow 55SMA line and the 8SMA is trending up. Again, can we get to the 113 level? Look at the last 3 blue bars…the price has closed at the 111.70 level on all three bars…looks like we are in consolidation mode. The STO is showing overbought..The price could retreat back downward….IBO, what additional anaysis can employ here...thanks!

Hello fellow traders, EJ_4H Method part IV is likely to be published until the next weekend (27/28 May). This is a bit different from the 3 previous because is a flash back to the main view of the system. This will give you some facts about the using systems and strategies and the differences between winner and loser traders. I fact this is one step upper that give you better view that how to enter, execute and exit. Complete aspects of the system that give you the ability that have a clear decision in any time of the market is the last step. After covering all needs for that we will have such back to the main question: How we should enter, manage and exit a trade? Wishing a nice weekend. Ibo

--- 帖子 #339 ---
my reading of the USDJPY chart above is that there may be a consolidation or slight retracemenut to the 55MA, but that an uptrend has begun, by virtue of the yellow line levelling off.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi Ibo Looking forward to the next part. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
eurusdtrader, I've been reading all your posts in this thread and particularly, i like your generousity. Thanks you and hope to read more..

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Is it worth using?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi What do you think about EUR/JPY? I think this one has posibilities. It has no signal on 4H but it has on 1 Hour. TIA

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I think both the EUJR/JPY and the GBP/JPY bare watching for a sell signal. Both are in a range pattern, the 8 MA has a nice distance from the 55 MA and both have been having lower highs and lower lows over the last 3-4 bars.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I think in the same way THX

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I agree..there may be an opportunity for a sell and something to keep an eye on. The price is currently resting on the 8SMA on the 4-H chart. Let see if it can break through...

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Tragapips, migamb and ForexMike, It is a very decent trend, you know the instruction that how to be prepared for such condition. try to draw the patterns and make relations among indications. Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I just saw now that you sold, if you see the attached chart again, you can see that still price is above 8SMA, this is aggressive and any close below 8SMA is a confirmation of downside. If you look you can see that you will lose 20-30 pips if choose sell below white line rather than selling aggressively. BTW Part IV that will be published this weekend will enlighten this set-up. In case that you use other additional indications that give the weight to one side, then I recommend using limit orders because they get the top and dips very excellent and need few pips of stops. Moreover in case of reversing you can get out with few pips or even break-even, Buy I think you know how you should be kin to estimate the reversal zone. Good trading, Ibo

--- 帖子 #349 ---
THX for your advice Eurusdtrader.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Please. Tell me about this one. Gbp/Jpy. I see a big ascending triangle. Price hit resistance 3 times and right now price is consolidating above a support line. We have a sell signal. So this is what I think: A buy order above R1 @ 211.20 and/or a sell order below S1 @ 220.00. Some comments please.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hello, You are doing well. But totally this is the last step that I will take to explain. There are many aspects that we should consider. I just attach some pitures explaining some points. In the pic 1 you can see that the nearest important level.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
You can see that the importance of this level is doubled because it is weekly central pivot too.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Although we have a reversal from a decent trend but the potential supports are so close to eachother,in case of a sel-off market the 61.8% that is 55SMA here will be the first target and you should regard the support trend line that is for a major trend, so I recommend close watching to trail your stop ASAP to break-even and close the position if you see any reversal candle bouncing form a support. But if you think that this is a pair that its candles are overlapping ones, you are right, in the run of a trend you can see that the price will retrace to white line, this is the time that you can enter short. BUT when price reached yellow line or support it is a better case because it is indicating a major trend signal and you have more chance to be a winner. NEVER forget the relations among the diverse pairs, EUR is like GBP so GBPJPY will be so similar to EURJPY, meaning that you can see EURJPY condition and if you don't see any supporting for that and market for EURJPY is sell-off this means that you have a good chance to sell rather than buy. Best, Ibo

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Fantastic. I just lost 50 pips on the GBP/JPY when it turned tail and headed north and took out my stop. Note to self - use wider stops... - Ian

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Dear Ian, I can not agree with your opinion totally, basically a range for stop loss is determined by 3 point: 1-Timescale that you trade 2-Currency pair 3-Risk-Reward Ratio Of course there are some minor points that you can consider but it is not necessary we talk about them at the time. ATB, Ibo

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I was wondering if theres a chat room for EJ 4H users, Sam

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hello everybody, Today we had a very slight moving market, this is because of the hesitation of sellers and buyers, most of traders believe that the eurusd will back soon to its uptrend. Anyway, 1.2880/90 is the strong resitance that medium term buyers are waiting for its break, if 1.2660 breaks we may have a very sell-off market. In case that price is near one of these levels (1.2660/90 as support and 1.2880/90 as resitance) eye closely to pose the stop orders and not lose the opportunity to catch the market sharp move. you can see the ranging market, before any breakout/down. We can play old game of buy at supports and sell at resistances. Support your trades by taking the other complementry like daily pivots and candle patterns. Good trading, Ibo

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Here is a trade I took this morning and just closed out this evening. I sold the CHFJPY pair at 92.43 and closed it at 91.91 for 52 PIPS. The price continued to decline a little further, but I took my profits at the 55SMA as I did not wish to hold any positions over the holiday weekend. I also got out because the pair looks like it is now very oversold according to the STO and other indicators. You can see the arrow signaling a sell and you can also see the preceding weak price action leading up to the decline. Mike

--- 帖子 #359 ---
i am new to forex. I have a question about weekly pivot points on your chart. Do they update automatically or do we have to update those manualy? Is there a place where i can see weekly pivots points instead of calculating those?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hello, You soould read the very first post, They are automatic , you should just always update your monthly and weekly charts, because they are the source DATA to draw the PPs. Ibo

--- 帖子 #361 ---
eurousdtrader, Thanks for sharing the Method. I read the post from start to finish and now testing it . Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hello Traders, Just I wanted to add: For weekly pivots it is enough that you onetime a week (preferably the first day) update the weekly chart. The same goes for monthly. Update the monthly chart first day of month and then you can use the proper monthly pivots for its 30 days. NOTE: Market is in a sideways and one of the key levels should break to start a new trend or continue the previous trend. Just you should keep in mind that targets must be limited and never aim for much pips. Preferably close your positions at the end of that day. The nest week should be a catalyst then we can plan for very profitable trades. ATB, Ibo

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hi, Can you explain how to update the charts? Ishay

--- 帖子 #364 ---
switch your current chart view to weekly and monthly for it to update then switch back to 4H

--- 帖子 #365 ---
What kind of stop/loss did you use for this test. Thanks for doing the work.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Skyline, in addition to the SL question for your testing, please include your TP paramenters used. Thanks, K

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Ishay, In MT4 when you are watching a chart say eurusd weekly then weekly chart for eurusd is updated. In other words if you want to update all the time scales for eurusd you should click the buttons of M1,M5,M15,M30,H1,H4,D1,W1, MN. So, just to update wekly and monthly charts you should push the W1 and MN button. Example: in the picture below the H4 chart will be updated.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Can anybody tell me clearly abt EJ-4H method....

--- 帖子 #369 ---
beantownthunder, go to the 1st post and check out the 3 documents posted. Lots of good stuff!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Could you please give us more information about risk reward ratio that you use for trading?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Ishay, risk-reward ratio is the proportion of stop loss to take profit. e.g. you enter a position with 20 pips of stop loss and 40 pips of take profit. Then the risk-reward ratio for this wil be: 20/40=0.5. The less, the better. Then The ratio depends on the target that you have in mind for your trades. targeting is a very vast issue in trading. So we need talk about the risk management and targeting method before. Have a nice weekend, Ibo

What is the ema_slope indicator, I do not see this indicator anywhere? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Thanks kalle7. I just got better with your help

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Mike The ema_slope indicator measures the slope of the EMA (exponential moving average) that one is using to trade and gives a positive or negative value on a degree/angle basis. Very similar to the CCI incicator with the + or - 100. Good visual (but this is an individual thing) Please note that this inidcator is not part of EJ_4HR method and is just an indicator that doubletop trades with. Hope this helps? Happy trading MM

--- 帖子 #388 ---
hello eurustrader, i like your EJ_4H method. It gives so many information to me to make any trade. One more thing, i really like your EJ_Signal.mq4 indicator. Can you add any sound to it when the signal(arrow) is appeared ? I think it will be the best indicator after this. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hello, You are welcome, I'd like to do many for you for free, but I dont have the time, I have my own works to be done, my new approches to markets, in high levels the techniques are very time consuming and you should keep abreast of news and breakthroughs. I wanted to make a community through private mentoring to empower them do many things. We have a solid schedule (remember the discipline for trading) and are try to make many new and great stuff and readings or services like signals or analysis for tradres. Best, Ibo

Hi all, Please find attached Ema_slope indicator. Although this is not part of the EJ_4HR trading method, i thought it would be great for those who want to have at this indicator. Remember to Keep It Simple . Happy trading MM

Could you please let me know how to install it in the method? Ishay

Save to your Experts ----Indicators file, restart your MT4 platform, find indicator in Custom Indicators and open. Arrows should appear on your chart. The default should already be set for "alarm on".

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thanks MM Would you know if one has to do anything with the angle threshold, Start or End EMA shift inputs? I just tried this and added this to my chart. I selected for the MA the 55 and placed it on the 4H chart. The indicator is a nice visual! Regards, Mike

Hi Guys, I would like to ask why when looking at a chart, which was loaded with the "ej 4h-dual stoch". template, in the indicators list there appears a list of seven windows with Stochastics, apart from the main chart? Is this some bug maybe? herty

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I'm a fan of pop-up alerts so I took the EMAAnglezeroalert MQ4 and changed the EMA's to EJ_4H's and put in a pop-up alert that should also make a sound. I wasn't the original coder of emaanglezero but I just modified it.

Dear All Friends, This is a friendly reminder: NO NEW THREAD FOR EJ_4H METHOD PLEASE! I thank all of our members that never follow the new threads started by the new members that unwittingly or forgetfully start new threads related to EJ_4H Method. Many thanks to FF moderator guys that always support me to make the best community here. NEW MEMBERS should attentively read the first post to be awarned of what to do and what not to do after joining us. As a very old agreement we never start a new thread and by this, we never distract the attention and focus on the method. We will do all our activities in the framework of this thread. ATB, Ibo

--- 帖子 #404 ---
i read the whole thread and all I see is renamed old indicators and some bla bla documents and the million dollar choice to wire some money for more info. i don't want to point fingers and helping others to spot setups and teach trading in general is a good concept but it must be done in a fair way. eurousdtrader, why don't you state that you use Vegas 4h method combined with ASCTrend/SilverTrend and ASCBars that have been around for a while? some sort of copyright note or reference would be advisable. i like that you teach your stuff in steps for a newbie to easily follow but I would reconsider giving you any money just for that. private mentoring sounds nice but who are you to teach? Vegas spent whole pages just to tell his story. i read your all 4 documents and it did not make sense that much and I am not even a professional trader. i do apreciate that you put some pieces to gether and show how to build a system from scratch to newbie. its better to learn this way than from $2000 closed code systems that bring nothing.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thanks for the opinion.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I didn't want to be the first one to say anything before but I did notice that the signal given was the same as silver trend indicator from the beginning. However, you can't accuse the EJ method of just re-using old indicators. It's the way that it was put together in a system and taught. Vegas method has different approach to the same idea and if people want to follow EJ's way ... then so be it. Private tutoring take up people's time and it's shouldn't be free. If this is a scam ... then it wouldn't last long. I myself wouldn't pay for this ... I would take the ideas already given out for free and try to make sense of it on my own.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
well, it does not matter that much where the indicators and signals are from and Ibo explains how to use them. maybe I was a bit too harsh in my previous post. i am currently working to implement all 3 Vegas methods into a decent EA with proper MM. As Vegas said somewhere he trades the method that best suits given situation and that it does not prefer neither 1h, 4h nor daily over each other. so my EA should deside which method to use in changing markets and how much to risk. A Bot will never outperform a skilled trader but it could prove itself to be self sufficient and that is what I am looking for at the moment. i don't have the time to stare at charts for 24/5 and even if I did I still would not want to do it. As Eurousdtrader said, short time frames are a lot of needless stress. however, the major problem and in my mind it is not addressed here enough is how to spot the wrong signals and exit in a timely fashion. probably Money Management will be discussed in the Part V+ documents. I need an EA to provide a base of building my FX trader career. Maybe it is possible, maybe not.

Hi everyone... The other day the server went down for a little while there were a few things that happened one was My access to the forum was limited and some of the threads were disturbed I noticed that the vote rating has dropped, so did the number of views, which should not be possible.. If it is not to much bother, could everyone who voted go and vote again. If the system accepts your vote and you already voted, the rating file could have been damaged... Or there could have been something that happened when I put two posts in this thread from extraneous threads... Thanks Much, Scott

--- 帖子 #411 ---
This is kind of an answer to the angry letter of piccolo. It is not that I am pro or anti, just a thought. I am interested to pick Ibo’s brain as much as I can, for example. One of the reasons is that he is definitely a foreigner so he thinks differently and may have an alternative view on the market. See, you knew all systems that Ibo presumably borrowed, and I am sure they were more than enough to make you a very rich and happy person already, if used properly. Then you are not busy any more because the market takes care of you. I am also working with another guy, who is consistently making dozens or even hundreds percents of his account every month. What he has on his charts? MACD with the basic settings, basic stochastics, PPs and 2 EMAs, and that is it. 10 pips a day, as he likes to say, and these tools is all you need to become a multimillionaire very fast. People who really succeeded developed something else, behind the scene knowledge, if you wish. Their secret is irrational. When they, for whatever reason, decide to share their secrets, read it through many times trying to get in between the lines. That is where the real secret is. It is not about what toys you use. It is about what is going on inside of you when you use them and no technology will help you here. Of course, this is just my humble opinion. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hello, Thanks for the notes, I think I have talked about this fact that I'd like to say 50 pips a week rather than 10 pips a day. When you tighten the numbers of the profits that you need to make for a living, you will have a trouble, because you will think that you have to get 10 pips each day and this will force you enter trades that are not good ones, why you don't say 1 trade a week with a target of about 100 pips or two trades a week with 50 pips of target for each? There is a big truth that we need to learn basics of day trading, because always we can not trade on higher time scales (like the recent market in majors) in a ranging market we have to day trade, get less pips but make several trades. Plus, all day trading concepts is a good tool to time the best entry when you are trading hogher time frames like H4 and daily. Close price is the most important price. Candle charts is one of the best charting methods that traders use. After closing each candle we usually have to check the type of candle (open/close price, range, is it a candle pattern like spinnig top, hammer, doji and so on). If you trade on hourly you have to check the market off every one hour during the sessions. In fact you will have a killing job and many traders (that I have seen) could not tolerate more than a year. Moreover smaller time scales are less technical and most of the time disappoint traders especially newbies that are interested in getting good results of what they have learned about trading forex. I recommend that you learn intraday trading basics but never develop your main strategy on smaller time scales. I hope this helps, Excuse me for this long letter, Best, Ibo

piccolo, What you need first is a good theripist, who can properly analyse your brain functions. I don't think you are capable enough for trading. The kind of mindless attack to IBO just shows how sick you are. Before analysing EA's and Indicators, Please go and test your mind in some good clinic..I don't think thats avaiable from where you coming .so please browse the net and test some method on yourself before coming here. IBO, Some people just don't get it. I know the pain it takes for a newbie to learn any new systems and here you are teaching the tricks of the trade for free. I'm ever gratefull to you for taking your time and sharing your thoughts. Please continue the great work....there are 100's like me who will vouch for the good work you are doing... Some people just can't fill themselves from taking ..never even saying a thankyou. Moderators, I know personal attacks are not allowed in here. I'm sorry for that...But the msg from piccolo is just too much insulting without knowing the facts of the thread starter. piccolo, You were not only harsh but unashamed on yourself, as if you were, you could have read the enire thread and asked for advice on EA.

Dear Friends, Thank you all for your kindly support. We have a very congenial and friendly group here and I am happy that I could be a bit of help. We never let others distort this friendship but this is life and different people have different thinkings. I have a friendly request: don't waste your time/life for such talks, we are here to learn from each other about trading. Let's forget the past and start off. ATB, Ibo

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi All (including piccolo), IBO is free to express himself and to share his knowledge the way he sees best. Mindless attack on the work of others is not to be encouraged. Ibo has spent a lot of time presenting his material and it is totally irrelevant where he got it from or whose system he is presenting. Even VEGAS [that Piccolo refers to] said in his documentations that people should take his idea(s) and run with it. No one system is perfect and people should be encouraged to think outside the box (as often as possible). Development comes from taking what someone has done and adjusting it to suit your style. I have constantly come across people (mainly like Piccolo) who attack the work(s) of others without offering positive solutions or ideas. They go from forum to forum with their eyes closed and attack anything that is similar to what they have read somewhere else. I find it strange that Piccolo also asks for later versions of EJ_4HR method documentations??? All this is not important, what matters is that we keep sharing and working together to become better at trading. Happy trading all and please lets get back to talking about the markets. Any ideas welcome. Lets stay FOCUSED MM

--- 帖子 #416 ---
i found envelopes around 55 SMA helping me to determine eisier what Ibo refers to as a good distance between the MAs. just zoom out every currency pair you trade and find the best fit for the last several moves. I always keep envelopes on my charts, they are like a roadmap. so, if a currency is sitting in the top zone, the buy is questioning, and the same goes for the downside. same idea as vegas's fibo lines, but to me much simpler and more obvious.

Hello I did reread my original post and did not find anything that bad but never mind, maybe I just had a boring day at the office and probably should check my brain next time I'm in New York as according to lavista4u we don't have medical facilities here. ( I don’t want to argue on that). I do appreciate Ibo’s work and effort and lets listen to mmbmusa and concentrate back on trading. Maybe in the weekend I’ll look at chinplant’s EA for Ibo’s system and try to improve it a bit (or if necessary start from scratch) for the benefit of us all. (now it just makes strange trades I wouldn’t open manually). As for a 4H method alerts on e-mail and sms are necessary. Cool off everybody and defend your bank account, not some lame discussions.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi everyone, I think the EA that Chinplant posted (I believe it was back on page 20 or 21 of this thread) definitely has good potential. I've been letting it run for the past couple of days, and so far it has been impressive. I've been exiting parts of the trades at specific target points manually, but it seems to do a good job of something that is most difficult for me. Finding an entry point. Has anybody else experimented with this? Thanks!

about ej_4h expert advisor... i am in live test from some week and i have +1100 pips , i use default setting in 10 pair (every with spread = or above 5 pips) is possible add a trailing stop to this expert ? p.s. sorry for my bad language :-)

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I've been using the default settings as well. A TSL would be great. I was wondering if you knew how it exited trades. I know that it waits for the bar to close with the indicator before it initiates an entry. How does it exit? When it first gets a signal in the opposite direction?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Can you post the EA you are using please thanks !!

EurUsdTrader, Which broker provides USDSGD data feed ?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Great thread. I especially found adding the envelopes to the 55 sma usefull. With the right setting it is quite accurate at determining exhaustion points that reinforce the entry criteria.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Well, I thought I was doing ok with the EJ_4H indicator until I saw it sit there and hemorrage over the GBP/JPY. Totally blew up my demo account. I thought I may have had something but obviously I still have no clue what I'm doing. I'll just shut up and sit on the sidelines from now on.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Many brokers, for example : www.alpari.org www.northfinance.com

--- 帖子 #436 ---
yes, it exits the moment first opposite arrow flashes (doesn't matter if it stays there).

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thanks Piccolo. I was thinking that after it kicks you out of the trade, it then re-enters the trade if the price goes back to the point where the opposite arrow disappears. Since the arrow from the previous bar's close is still there, it enters again? Then if the price triggers another indicator opposite it kicks you out again, losing the spread each time over and over. If that is the case, I guess the big question is do we want it to exit at the first opposite indication? If so, it should not re-enter when the opposite indicator disappears. Perhaps re-enter when the original signal reappears. Does this make sense? Thanks everybody

--- 帖子 #438 ---
http://www.powerbase.info/ej1.gif I'm thinking that the lime line looks enticing for a pending long position. Has anyone else been watching this?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
it's too early, don't throw yourself against a train.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
well, I think that we should exit way before the opposite arrow appears because it costs a lot of unrealized pips. I think eurotrader could pour some thoughts on this one. Anyways, re-entering on original signal reappearance (if opposite signal does not confirm) could prove interesting, I'll backtest it.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I totally agree that one should wait for a clearer signal. However, 1.27 will probably be a strong resistance for the pair but given that price may be at an exhaustion point it is probable that it will break. One strategy could be to do a scalp like entry near 1.2685 as it approaches the 1.2695 pivot and then tighten the stop to break even as soon as possible. Though, this would be quite an agressive entry, their should be enough momentum approaching the point to make this a good entry which could position for a break of the downward channel and pivot which are coincidentally aligned. The other strategy would be to put your order on the right side of the downward channel where most of the orders are likely to be.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
We really can not say a 100% instruction for entering opposit side, just I can say here that if the slope of 55SMA is steep then it is better never go to the contrary side, because fighting a trend is a sheer folly when you don't have anu other solid indication. Such indications are rare and they bear high risks, but when the market has a cyclical behavior then you can enter opposit side. Ibo

--- 帖子 #443 ---
what about exit? maybe on first sign of 8SMA slope change? or confirmed slope change? or just trail/tighten stop order.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Dear Members, As you can see recently eur broke through a support cloud. This happened after a killing ranging market. Moreover yesterday's fall was sharp. You should keep in mind that after very sharp moves usually traders hesitate to initiate any new trade or at least they never go opposit direction, Sharp moves happen because of very solid reasons and rarely they come back soon. Today was Friday and as the last day of the weekly business round and after a calm market in European session (that is the most active session) tradres prefered to stay aside, because they knew that after NY session there won't be any active market to move the price in their direction. Breaking such a long term sideways may be is a start of a new down trend and initiating a rash long positin, at least for today, was not a professional doing. Have a nice weekend, Ibo

--- 帖子 #445 ---
powerbase, it is funny: i kept 2 pairs of envelopes at first, too, but then decided there were too many lines and removed the inside pair. also, according to the Ibo strategy number 2 we do enter when the price sits at the very top, for example, if the 55SMA is pointing up. then, by moving up, 55 SMA creates new space for the price to move, so i would say in a sharp moving market it does not really help. i am also experimenting with an envelope around 8SMA to trail stops. if you zoom the whole thing out, you can find the setting that would keep you in the most of the resent trades and retracements. Keep them there, until they stop working and then readjust. It works only in the trending market: when the price goes up, it normally sits on the upline of the 8SMA envelope - then you drug your stop loss along the bottom envelope line and opposite for the downside move. i think envelope is a very simple and useful tool that, apparently, does not look very cool, so people are pursuing funnier looking toys instead. If you decide to play with stop/loss and 8 SMA envelope, please, tell me what you think. Again, those are only experiments for now, so be careful.

As a newbie myself I just want to thank you for putting the time and effort into each article. I just completed each article as well as every post in this thread. Your swimmer anecdote hit home with me as that is how I'm currently feeling. Like everybody else is seeing exaclty what I'm missing. I'm looking forward to my journey of learning.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I actually just started experimenting with the envelope for guaging exhaustion points on slow time frames and have not actually done an actual EJ trade yet, but look forward to testing the system. Today I simply scalped the market with a typical channel trade because of the weekend and unlikely reversal of trend. As far as envelopes are concerned I have found them usefull at faster time frames for guaging quick scalping opportunities. The reason I am looking to learn this system though is to make less trades and have less stress. This system seems very promising. I look forward to learning its ins and outs from IBO. Thanks again.

Thank you eurusdtrader for your work/input. As a newbie i've learnd a lot here!.

Hey guys. I've been following this thread for quite some time trying to absorb as much as possible. I am using TradeStation to create entry/exit points. Anyone else? Anyway, my main question is how do you guys handle channel areas. I define (as many do) a channel area when the 8 / 55 are within 50 pips of eachother. Thanks mrLogik

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Many of the answers you seek are listed on the first page of this thread. You should download the docs on the first page and then read and re-read each PDF. For example the timeframe we are using is 4 hour which is listed in the name of the method. EJ_ 4H method. Really though you should read the documents on the first page. I'm about as a big of a newbie on this board as there is and I have read them three times now and each time I find more answers.

ok, iam back again I read through the threat but dont know more as before. Now my questions, i hope you can answer 1. Why are there different parts? What is the difference? Do i need all parts? 2. What are pivot points / resistance / ea / lot(s)... all that terms (iam really sorry but i simply dont find a answer (even at google) 3. Could you in simple words (so that a beginner can understand it) explain how i set "take profit" and "stop loss" 4. Why is it called ej_ 4h ? Aren't the predictions in the 1min/15min/30min ... charts usefull/as good as the 4h? 5. Why is there a clock, what does it say? I think these are my first questions.

Hello all Friend, As far as you know, unfortunately we had a crash on FF server, there were some losts of the data and I came across with one about our thread. I talked to the admin and he kindly helped me in this way. I ask you to confirm that if I am wrong or right, you can send a private message to admin or moderators as well as cite here in our thread. Last time before server down, the view number of our thread was something around 36000. In fact it must be higher than 41k now. I have a request from members who frequently view the thread that inform the admin/moderators of this fact. Thanks for the help , Ibo

i really did, but i just dont understand what 8sma is, or what a decent trend line is.. its just to new to me, so need a little help inn all these terms, i hoped that you could help me.. so, do i just have to add the other parts to the first graph or do i have to put them on a new chart? And why are there so many tpl files? Why dont you answer my questions, and the questions of zzz in the beginning you answered. mike

--- 帖子 #464 ---
read a book on technical trading, please. there are newbie questiens and there are lazy questions based of your own ignorance. if you can't master the basics yourself, you won't master the trade. I bet when you enter a trade you ask everyone "where should I exit?" think for a moment why you want to become a trader and what are you willing to do to accomplish it. I don't want to discourage you but you just have to do the thinking yourself or sell ice cream till you can afford a mentor (although there is a lot of free good stuff laying around here and in other forums, websites, blogs).

how can you freakin make sense out of this method? There is no way of predicting when the market will go into whipsaw mode like it has been for the past 6 weeks with the usd pairs. So i am unable to make sense out of this mehtod if i were to follow it i would have been screwed. And the ma crosssing dont work. so frustrated b/c i have been at this for 15 yrs and evereyone who says there methods work really doesn't. All i need to know is how to spot a good trade and the pdf books really dont help. IUf i were to wait for stochasticsa tyo cross i would have missed many moves.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I am more of a scalp trader myself, but Ibo's method has been helping me to think more long term in my strategic trading. The best advice that I could give in making sense out of this method would be to use it in conjunction with channels, trendlines, support, and resistance levels. Also, pay close attention to how price reacts around the MA's. Usually, the best entries are at or near the MA's or at the channel borders.

you are funny bigballer. say, vegas is making tons of money with his system. can you repeat that? if yes, why you are here? people are making tons of money with simplest systems, but it is not mechanical. there is always a gut feeling that you have to develop in order to get what they do and unfortunately it takes time, lots of it. even if you run a trading robot, you have to know how to use it properly. most of knowledge in trading is irrational, nothing works like 1, 2, 3 and here is the result. you may find hundreds of discussions on different forums, or hundreds of trading ideas in books but no system will work for you right away. it might for some time, but then when the market situation changes, it will stop. i am sure you know all this, according to your previous posts. you don’t like it here? try somewhere else and see if you get much faster and much better consistent results. i am sure you tried vegas. did you make lots of money with his seemingly simple system, especially with a recent chop? so, tell me please does vegas system work or no? what would be a proof for you? vegas himself making money? i am sure he somehow does. can you repeat that?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
as I see it and as has been said thousand times.. there are people who will make money with any system and there are people who won't with da best systems around. it's all subjective and a good trader will override system calls and sometimes won't follow them. i give you a system, i give you a track record but you won't know that I don't take 30% of the calls seriously. and it really doesn't matter if Ibo is making money and how much. all systems and methods should be reviewed by yourself and keep only those with which YOU can make money.

Dear Friends, This is the last week that I post here and will stop posting from 23 June 2006 but never stop helping and answering your questions. I always appreciate your interest and will do my best if I could. This is not because that I want to make money with any program, I never have had such a purpose from the very first day. This is not because that some of members insulted me. They got their answers by other members. This is not because that some guys are going to change this thread into a court that I am the suspect of this court. I gave you something as a gift and never got anything. Nowhere in the world, are people addressed for gifts. This is not because that the moderators addressed my claim about the "views figure" of the thread as a deceit. As a rule of thumb a thread with more than 480 replies must have bigger number for views. I have ONE solid reason that today I reached. What is that is not our discussion. I just post this to thank all friends that showed interests and always helped me by encouraging and thanking. I also thank all that gave their not so friendly opinions about this thread or method or even me. I am happy to say that as our old talks I never stop helping and interested members never hesitate if they had any question. Just email me at [b]ejeddi@gmail.com[/b] and I would be happy to be a bit of help for you. Happy trading, Ibo

Kaki, forgive me, but I needed a good laugh again. As has been stated many times all over the forum, every system has to be tried and molded to one's own style of trading and every system is not for everybody. BUT The way you put this, almost sounded as if after fifteen years you don't know how to spot a good trade...but I know I am wrong in what I initially perceived because I'm sure at this stage you can spot them a mile away. It's good to be able to learn from the old hands around here. Thanks guys, a really great forum this and thanks ej for what you have shared here. Good luck to you for the future.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hello KAKI Sad to read about your frustrations. I am amazed at what you have written especially given that you have been trading for 15years (or being around trading for that long).

Thus far, since reading this thread and the previous, i have made good gains following the rules of the 4H system. Sorry to see you go. There are always many who will ridicule just to be noisy. for me the system works. just takes patience. when first trying it, i lost... but as time went on, and i began to understand the concept, i have now made steady gains. I used to scalp, and was happy with just 20 a day.... now i can set the trade, watch carefully, and make more per week while working for the other guy. Thanks for sharing.

Thanks Ibo, this really helps in making this wonderful system better. This is truly an extraordinary system! Thank you.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I have another question regarding entering during a trend. Part IV of the EJ_4H Method, shows clearly how one should go about in entering after a Retrace. My question is the position of the Stochs. Look at the attached Stochs. Earlier on they both showed an upward "long" position, and then later contradictory directions. Does this mean one can ignore them and enter a "short" position if the Sell Stop gets triggered?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Please keep in mind that Price is the best indicator so you should give more importance and priority to line study. Plus, old indicators like RSI, STOCH and so on have been designed for stock market primarily years ago and they can not be leading indications in forex market which has a considerable turn over in comparison with stock exchange market. Choose trades that are in the direction of main trend. As you can see short time EMA has crossed longer term one and the main trend is DOWN. Magenta bars' color confirms this fact. Last candles have bounded from EMA and have broken short term upside channel. Even you can fit a 1-2-3 pattern and all these indications call for a short trade. If you employ some line study techniques like fibo ratios I think you can find more reasons. One of the best usages of old indicators is divergence. A divergence + breakout indicate a probable trustable indication to enter a trade in the direction of the breakout. Old indicators will work better in range-bound market conditions. I hope this will help, Rgds, Ibo

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Thanks Ibo, it makes sense. Ok, I should have known, Price is King! Are these MA's Exponential, and not Simple, because I don't think I found these MA settings anywhere? Just to make 100% sure. Is it Exponential, applied to Median Price? Thanks, Linus

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Correction! I just found in the opening paragraph of the EJ_4H Method that it refers to the "Yellow 55SMA". So which one is better? SMA or EMA? Thanx

--- 帖子 #506 ---
SMA, but it does not matter if you want to check EMAs too. Stick to the conceptions not settings.

IBO, Thank you for all of the time you spent on this thread. I followed both the 4 hour tunnel and Dial's knife. The one thing I struggled with was how to determine the direction of the trade. You answered this question for me. Can you suggest some reading material on the 1- 2 - 3 set up? I see this mentioned and even charted but I still don't really understand it. Also you once asked for an English speaker to help proof read documents. Did you have another one in progress? Thanks Joe

^ How long have you been forward testing it, Rob?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I followed this system since Nov 2006. I did a lot of simulation and forward test it, using demo account until Dec 2006. Live trade it since Jan 2007 and my account has been increasing since then. This system fits my personality and lifestyle. My profitable trades are using the dual stochastics...especially when pairs went to overbought or oversold area and then reverses. Feb 26 to March 5 of GBP/JPY is heaven to me. Rick

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hello drick008, It's nice that you are successful now. It was your perseverance that made you successful. You have atuck to the rules and fit it for your personality. Patience is so important that many of young traders never follow. They waste their time in looking for a perfect one while there is no perfect one. It is interesting for me that you have applied the method for GBPJPY. Personally I think that this method does not suit for trading the pair. I wonder that you proved the opposite. Happy trading, Ibo

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I began using it on demo since early December and recently went live 5 weeks ago. I've been using EJ, with confirmation help from 4H MACD ("400 Pip/month"), and support/resistance to help me make decisions. So far it's provided me with nearly +1100 pips over the past 5 weeks, and averages +120pip/week since december. I've got nothing but praise for EJ. I would actually be sitting somewhere around +1600 pip if I was more disciplined. USD/CAD this week, GBP/JPY, and EUR/USD previously cost me around 500 Pips from trying to catch reversals instead of just making trades with the trend, oh well I'm learning still. Rob

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi eurusdtrader, Thanks for the compliment but I owe it to your system. When I started looking into Forex, around Jan. 2006, I was looking for a perfect system that will give me a perfect signal. I was wrong. I beleive an indicator or signal is just telling me their is an opportunity. The entry, managing, and exiting a trade is a skill that I had to master. Your notes gave me a lot of entry strategies. I even printed them out and highlighted a lot of lines, so during simulation I wrote down where I can get in and see if I'm right or not. From this, I learned how to add positions during a trend and how to get back in if the trend continues. GBP/JPY is the most profitable pair for me. Next is the GBP/USD. I see other pairs works fine but the return is much more on GBP/JPY and GBP/USD...pips-wise. I want to thank you and those who contributed to this thread. Rick
