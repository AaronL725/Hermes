I have been a member of FF for a while now and I have really been blessed with this great forum. I have met great people here on this forum and also learn a lot. As a token of my appreciation, I will like to share this simple system that I call bread and butter trade. This system is not for every trader, but if you find it useful, pls feel free to adapt it to your personality. Another thing I will like to say before I go to the system is that as a trader, you need to reduce the drawings on your charts to see price which is truely the best indicator. Forget about all your numerous lagging indicators, look at price, apply sup/res and you will do well. Another thing is that you should stop looking for the guru that will help you to be successful. The guru is you....yes, I mean you reading this. You are the best trader that can ever be....only if you belief. I have been trading this system for over 3 yrs now and it has consistently given profit. It can be used as a scalping method as well as for long term trades. It is not 100%, but you can adapt it as you like...remember, you are the best trader the world is waiting for. The System Pair: EURUSD. (I trade mainly eu but I am sure that it work on all pairs) Chart time frames: 1hr, 4hr and daily charts Indicator: 24ema applied to close. Rule: There are only 2 rules to remember. 1. When price is above 24ema (minimum of 20+ pips), and price starts to travel towards 24ema i.e. price is falling towards 24ema, set a buy limit at 24ema with anticipation that there will be a bounce back UP. Vice visa for sell. Target 10+ pips 2. When price is below 24ema and travelling UP towards 24ema, If price close above 24ema, Then open and close above 24ema, set a buy limit at 24ema anticipating a retest of 24ema for the journey UP. Vice visa for sell. Stop Loss: The stop loss is derived from rule 2 above. For Buy: When price close below 24ema, then open and close below 24ema, close the trade. For Sell: When price close above 24ema, then Open and close above 24ema, close the trade. Avoid News time. A picture to illustrate: [IMG]file:///C:/Users/IBUKUN%7E1/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot.png[/IMG][IMG]file:///C:/Users/IBUKUN%7E1/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.png[/IMG] UPDATE: Steve have been so kind to write an ea for this method. Pls find attached. The ea keep watching for the position of the 24ema and based on the distance you choose (bufferpips in the ea property), the limit order will be sent. 20 pips is the default. pls play around with the toy, but get the real foundation of the method manually first while you try the ea on demo. You are responsible for your own trade, so use responsibly. UPDATE 2: Steve updated the EA and added 2 script for us to test it out. Pls read post No: 55 for details but find below Steve's statement: The two scripts will read the EMA for you and send the appropriate limit order at that price. So long as you use the same magic numbers for scripts and EA, the EA will then monitor the trade for you and (should) move the trade fill price in line with the ema. Set StopTrading to 'true' and the ea will monitor and manage the existing trade, but not send a fresh one once the trade has closed or been deleted. The only update to the EA is to display the ticket number of the trade it is monitoring on your screen to confirm that it is working with the correct trade. Update 3: Squolou have been very kind to improve this strategy by making a dashboard. Pls find attached the dashboard. Update 4 Steve has done it again. He has come up with a multi pair trading ea for the bread and butter trades. Pls take it for a test and lets come up with the best optimisation for the robot. Chk out the detail intrustructions at: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...33#post4820733 Cheers.

Ibuk's motto is simple makes money. I have been with ibuk for a few months now and take these bounces when they come along. Basically when the price is far away from the 24 ema and it comes to touch it the trades are awesome. just leave limit orders and get filled very simple yet effective method. 1hr and above.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Looks like a prime candidate for an EA. Nice idea IBUK!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Could you explain the stop loss position again... the TP position is clear... a simple +10pips... I don't quite understand the SL position though? Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Rule: There are only 2 rules to remember. 1. When price is above 24ema (minimum of 20+ pips), and price starts to travel towards 24ema i.e. price is falling towards 24ema, set a buy limit at 24ema with anticipation that there will be a bounce back UP. Vice visa for sell. Target 10+ pips 2. When price is below 24ema and travelling UP towards 24ema, If price close above 24ema, Then open and close above 24ema, set a buy limit at 24ema anticipating a retest of 24ema for the journey UP. Vice visa for sell. Stop Loss: The stop loss is derived from rule 2 above. For Buy: When price close below 24ema, then open and close below 24ema, close the trade. For Sell: When price close above 24ema, then Open and close above 24ema, close the trade. Pls read the red letter very well.... read it twice and digest it. When a candle closes on the opposite side of your trade, you take note of the opening price (at the opposite side of the trade) and the closing price. If these 2 are on the opposite side of your trade, then close it. At this point you want to reverse your trade. You put a limit at the 24ema in anticipation of a retest. Try and keep it very simple. Hope this answer your question?? Ibuks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks Ibkus for your reply. I must be being thick today. On the EU chart for the 12:00 GMT trade on the 1hr you could enter a sell limit because the current market position was &gt;20pips from the EMA. That part I get. The 12 o'clock 1hr candle will open and close under the EMA. So I presume you close the limit order and enter a new one at the new EMA position for the 1 o'clock candle (if it meets the &gt;20pips rule). So far so good. My TP is 10pips from the sell limit order.. but I am still not understanding where to place the SL. Thanks for your patience Ibuks! You are very kind.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I'm going to code it up and see what happens... 80)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
@Ibuks Thanks! Looks like a brilliantly simple and clean-cut method. I will be surely checking it out! If I understand the concept correctly you don't place a stop loss (other than your usual emergency SL). You eyeball the trade and get out if one full candle (from high to low) closes on the wrong side of the EMA.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
You either place the order with no SL or the SL is far away as a sanity stop. The exact SL isn't a level you can know when you enter the trade. You exit when the price bar closes below the EMA. It might close far below the EMA or maybe closer but you have to wait for the bar to close to know.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
This is as simple and effective as it can get in fx trading...............great one ibk

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks for the guidance on the SL everyone... I'll give it a try. Would you adjust the pending order each hour to account for movement in the EMA?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I also watch EMA at this level. You just have to watch out for new trend(s) that is(are) developing. See example below:

--- 帖子 #13 ---
A moving average indicator showing price label would be very useful for this system. Anyone?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Here is an example trade which I normally trade. I avoid news like plague as nothing respects news...lol. You can treat the bread and butter trade as bounce or break. Bounce on the 24ema is the bread while the break of 24ema is the butter. With the bounce, you can get as much pips as you want if you manage your trade properly while the break can be a trend change that can give you lots of pips until you get another trend change. Remember, you need to own it and use it as it fits your personality but pls make it simple. The more complicated you ty to make it, the less pips you get and the more confused you are. Happy trading. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #15 ---
"set a buy limit at 24ema with anticipation that there will be a bounce back UP. Vice visa for sell. Target 10+ pips" Thank you for sharing your system. Could you please explain how you set a buy limit at the 24ema 1) since the ema is formed only when bar closes. How do you "catch the bounce" accurately, 2) do you use the previous 24 ema as reference and add/subtract a few pips? 3) SL is bar open and close "on the wrong side" of 24ema - that would mean that SL could be more than 10 pips (could even be very big) - so risk could be bigger than reward ( may not be 1:1) Do you have a maximum you let it run? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
sounds interesting, i'll give it a whirl on demo.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
If I'm not mistaken, that would be a whoppin' 50 pip loss ;-)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Pls see update on post 1. EA can be use to trade manually helping you identify the position of the 24ema. Play the bounce also remember you can play the breaks as well. The ea currently play the bounce, further update will play the breaks as well I belief. Happy trading. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi ibuk some obvious questions arise, as pointed out by laimonk. to set a limit order in advance , you need to guess the position of the 24ema in advance. the problem here is, you cannot accurately 'predict' the position of the 24 ema as it moves constantly and can indeed have huge moves on big price movements. the closing position could be way different then the point at which you set the limit order.. how do you deal with this and how do you set the limit order yourself. an illustrated example would be helpful.. i still dont understand the SL criteria. again if you can show an example please. lastly, it seems that this method only works well in a trending market, in a ranging market you will get stopped out many times ? also, what is the least number of pips distance the price needs to be at before the you can consider the bounce as valid. cheers

--- 帖子 #20 ---
couple of other things just sprang to mind: does there have to be a touch of the 24 ema. if not, then what is the lease distance it can be from the 24 ema before we can take a trade ? sometimes the price just follows the 24 ema very close by. so not much of a room to enter bounce trades.

--- 帖子 #21 ---

Ans: You set limit orders based on the last hourly candle when trading manually. With the ea, it monitor the position of the 24ema and draws a line when it is 20 pips from it (using the default). You can however set what you think you are comfortable with. i still dont understand the SL criteria. again if you can show an example please. Ans: Read the post with trade example again. lastly, it seems that this method only works well in a trending market, in a ranging market you will get stopped out many times ? Ans: During ranging market, if the distance travelled away from the 24ema is not up to 20 pips, no need to take a trade as there is no need to trade any bounce. You can set the 20pips higher if you are comfortable. Trade it according to your personality. also, what is the least number of pips distance the price needs to be at before the you can consider the bounce as valid. Ans: Minimum of 10 pips and that is why I said 10+ pips. I hope the answers suffices. Cheers. cheers[/quote]

EA has its first trade on my demo - EJ buy, H1.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
[/quote] ok. thanks . i got the SL bit now. it seems though, that one has to be glued to the computer all day to check for bounces. and indeed to check for stop losses if trade is triggered. due to work committments, thats a difficult thing to do for me. in your experience are the higher time frames, daily, 4 hourly as effective ? ea's arent my thing. i dont use those. attached chart shows two trades i randomly selected, both got stopped out. going back to my point of a ranging market not so good...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
the above shows bounce entry short - red line. stopped out - blue line. another bounce entry - green line. stopped out - brown line. where the trades taken correctly ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
steve i always find it difficult to get ea's to work on my mt4 (alpari) platform. is there a special way of installing them..?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
all, there appears to be a bounce long trade just come up on the eu 1 hr chart...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Go to tools&gt;options&gt;expert advisors make sure everything is checked except for Ask manual confirmation Confirm DLL function calls

--- 帖子 #28 ---
how do i load the ea on the chart i want ?. i have quite a few ea's already on the mt4...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
well, the long bounce trade on the eu turned out to be a loser ... thinking of shorting..

--- 帖子 #30 ---
There was a cad news, so i was not even at my desk to trade at all. Yes it was a looser. You need to get your discipline with it and I will advice you backtest it and see how it fits your personality. To sell, you now need to put a limit at the 24ema to sell the bounce which may give you your losses and more if played well. Good try....

--- 帖子 #31 ---
losing one trade is not an issue at all.... i lose and win many during the course of a week. for your info. i had immediately eneterd short after the loss. and quickly recovered +20 pips. was very lucky.. i then waited for a bounce to the 24ema, and entered another short. currently still in the short, and last time i checked it was up +5 pips. lets see how things go. i may leave the trade open until next week. only thing is though will have to pay weekend spread !! GRRRRR ...!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thats the spirit mate....

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Ibuks, Thanks for sharing. Simple and easy to understand trading system. I have tested the EA on my MT4 strategic Tester with 10 years data using default setting. So far the result has been negative. However if i zoom it down to 3-5 years, it is profitable depending on the different time frame. Do you use the default setting? What is the best setting in term of profit target and stop loss? There are several occasion that huge SL take away all the profit that been made. I will do more testing on the major currency pair and share my finding. Another reason for the different in result may be the spread of broker. I am testing them on Oanda MT4 platform. Anyone else doing testing of the EA, please do share your finding. I think if we can fine tune the setting, it can be a very good scalper.. Cheers.....

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi erelation, Very good mate. On the backtest, did you get 90% data quality? I have not tried to backtest it at all and as I mentioned in my post, I trade it manually. However, I will be very interested in trading with the ea if there is much interest and we can together work on the settings that will be very profitable. Try it on higher tf as well and try to optimise it as well to see the best results. I will also to to do some work on it and come up with the results I get. Thank you to trying.... Ibuks

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Some one just called my attention to USDJPY trade opportunity with the 24ema. This move would have given 2 or 3 opportunities with each netting a minimum of 20 pips. Chk it out on your favourite pair and see if you can get the bread and the butter on it. Below is the picture.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
The EA is throwing this error for me: OP_SELLLIMIT order send failed with error(131): invalid trade volume It's probably something obvious... can anyone tell me how to fix this? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Maybe the EA is trying to send a 0.01 order but your broker's smallest lotsize is 0.1? I guess it has something to be like that. Try changing the lotsize.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
24 Ema bounce trading is a very successful system if used wisely. Phillip Neil started a thread in 2007 which can be seen here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=11854 Thanks for simplifying it even more Ibuks. This is what I like about your approach: 1-The 20 pip buffer avoids us from entering in ranging markets. 2-Your Stop Loss idea, which is not a hard stop but more a time based one.(Price opens and closes above, below the ema) Will be following this thread..

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Many thanks The7 for coming along. One thing I have come to understand about trading system is that the more simple it is, the better chance that you can think it through yourself without any external guru. Unfortunately, the human mind is so complicated and we always want something complicated before it can really make sense. However, if you can truely understand that life itself is simple, yet complicated, the more complicated you make it, the more complicated you will see and approach it. If you take it simple, you will see it simple and it will come to you simple. One thing still stand out, you are the best trader that the world is waiting for....so why not look inward, adapt some of the stuff you have learnt, take ownership and make it your own.....or you will follow gurus for the rest of your trading life.....this is bad becos you have only made the world wait in vain for your brilliancy.....lol Happy trading and have a great week full of pips. PS: Pls chk the 24ema with your favourite pair, chk it on the 4hr,daily and wkly and you will be amazed what will jump at you. Cheers. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks Jules, it's working now The EA has a stoploss parameter, is this actually used as an emergency backstop? Does the EA actually follow IBUK's candle stop loss rule? I haven't had a loser today so I was wondering what to expect with the SL situation when it happens. Cheers all.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
1.) add a function double lotsNormalized(string symbol,double lots) to the EA: Inserted Code // examplecall: lotsNormalized(Symbol(),0.0009) double lotsNormalized(string symbol,double lots) { //--- int decimals; double minLots = MarketInfo(symbol,MODE_MINLOT); double maxLots = MarketInfo(symbol,MODE_MAXLOT); double lotStep = MarketInfo(symbol,MODE_LOTSTEP); if (lotStep == 0.001) decimals = 3; else if (lotStep == 0.01) decimals = 2; else if (lotStep == 0.10) decimals = 1; else if (lotStep == 1.00) decimals = 0; lots = NormalizeDouble(lots,decimals); if (lots &lt; minLots) lots = minLots; if (lots &gt; maxLots) lots = maxLots; return(lots); //--- } 2.) change code in ~ln 1034 as follows (add "//"): comment this out: double SendLots = Lot; insert this: Inserted Code double SendLots = lotsNormalized(Symbol(),Lot); That should solve the problem with the wrong-entered lots.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hehe. I love the idea that I should add idiot-proofing to lot-size selection. Priceless. Anybody without the ability to work out that the default lot size is not accepted by their criminal has no place using an EA; any such individual needs to visit Babypips and learning the basics long before tacking a trading robot.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
2 winners for the Usd/Jpy for around 45 pips, 1 still on the way..Using daily pivots as TP levels EDIT: 3rd winner in a row. 24 pips and out

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Here is a nice low risk high reward opportunity. Pending Sell limit with 140 pips TP EDIT: Cancelled this pendng sell limit due high spread, which is 8 with Oanda ..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
How about only taking long trades when the EMA is sloping up and short when the EMA is sloping down? If it's flat stay away - ranging market. Trade in the direction of the trend - has to lessen the number of loss trades???

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I dont like touching the Euro nowadays but couldnt resist this opportunity. Entered short, took 15 pips and got out before waiting my original S1 line..Again..Euro is unpredictable these times..

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello The7, it may be an offtopic question, but could you upload the version of the FFCal-Indicator your are using on the charts you published here? I have several versions (?) of that one, but nothing seems to be working properly. Would be great, thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here it is..Make sure you allow Dll imports to make it work...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
thank you very much, that helped me a lot! I did not know that there are so many versions of that indicator around here, so it was not easy to find exactly the one I need (e.g. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...49#post4433249 / http://www.forexfactory.com/misc.php...hments&amp;t=19293 ).

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Another quick 18 pips with the spike. U/J is giving us good pips, cash in while you can. Also worth to consider how price respects the dotted red line, which is the 50 Ema.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi, all I've been for a while in this forum but never posted a single message before. I was back-testing this EA in a visual mode and seems to me it opens buy and sell limit orders in the wrong way. Please see attached scan.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
There was a nice quick trade on GU at the last hrly bar. GU was falling hard, hit the 24ema and bounced back up netting 10 and more pips. How easy can it be?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
On EU, there was the first touch on the 24ema 2 bars ago that gave a good pip. The second touch was however a loss.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
This is a textbook trade on eu even in this choppy consolidation area. 1. Price closed below 24ema 2. Price opened and closed below 24ema 3. Set a sell limit @ 24ema (anticipating a retest of 24ema) 4. Trade trigered and going well. This is the butter part..lol... Happy trading

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Here are some toys to help us all along. The two scripts will read the EMA for you and send the appropriate limit order at that price. So long as you use the same magic numbers for scripts and EA, the EA will then monitor the trade for you and (should) move the trade fill price in line with the ema. Set StopTrading to 'true' and the ea will monitor and manage the existing trade, but not send a fresh one once the trade has closed or been deleted. The only update to the EA is to display the ticket number of the trade it is monitoring on your screen to confirm that it is working with the correct trade.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi, Steve Thanks a lot, going to test now

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks Steve.... its very much appreciated. Will put it to test and get back to u. I will also replace post 1 with these ones. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi, Pls download and test the new one on page 1. I just applied it to a chart and it did the right thing sending a sell limit @ the 24ema. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Just get an error with the latest ea, "order send failed error 130 invalid stops". That's on usdchf, and on gbpjpy and eurusd it sends correct orders, strange ! Just let you know guys, thanks for the amazing work

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Congratz Guys Great strategy and EA.....You guys make an excellent team.... Bot is off to a perfect start...... Have a great day whip

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks Hiredwhip, I just got back home and saw that the ea took the same trade I took on demo and posted earlier. Very fine start. Am glad u like the simple method...bread and butter...lol. Simple make money, complication confuses....lol Cheers. ibuks

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Ibuks, Thank you for for sharing this strategy. I tested this strategy for june manually navigating the chart for EUR/USD. The results are good. Also i took the same trade and made some pips. Not tested the EA. Will do it shortly. Could you please let me know which EA version is correct, i cam see one on page 1 and Page 4. Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi Netwatchpips, Am glad you like it. I only posted the same ea on page 4 to post 1 for easy finding. The ea posted on page 4 by Steve is exactly the same one on the post 1. Cheers and happy trading. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Had a 28 pip loss here..Hate only posting winners..

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Seems like pairs with higher Atr's are riskier to trade. G/J, E/U can be volatile so I am staying away..

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Here is an useful indicator that should go well with this system. It is a horizontal line that can be moved and dragged around and will give a sound alert when price reaches a certain point.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Here is a current EU trade.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi all, some time ago Ibuks PM'ed me asking for a "Dashboard" for his system. I coded one; here it is. It displays the distances from the H1,H4 and D1 24EMAs as default, for 23 different pairs. You can switch to display only the current pair, or the full list, and change them as you wish. I used also the same inputs as in Steve's EA so you won't be lost. Other inputs will be self-explanatory. The distances are displayed in one of 4 colors, depending if price is above/below the EMA, and inside/outside the EMA Band of "BufferPips" distance. When price is inside the 20 pips band, the distance is in bold so you can easily see which pairs/TF are in the "starting blocks". Hope this is close enough to what you wanted, Ibuks Attached Image Sq

--- 帖子 #69 ---
The EU sell is still going nicely...this is why I said 10 pips or more...take what you want...lol

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Great work on the coding. This is invaluable. IS there a way it can show on the dashboard if the market is ranging. Then we can see all the info in one go. Like how many candles back was the last touch of the ema? Or is this too much to ask

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks Squl, This is simply whaoo.... this tool alone can make trading this system even easier and u dont have to bird watch anything again... Thanks mate.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Oh wow. Fantastic. sq, you are the answer to our prayers. I feel a multi-trader coming on, taking its values from the screen labels. Shall I do it or do you want to?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks again squl, The image below is the dashboard showing eu only. Great work mate. Will add it to the first post. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Yea Steve, A multi- trader brewing up. Steve + Squalou = A winning combination. Bring it on mate. Cheers. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Very Nice SQ, This puppy works like a charm......Great idea Ibuks!!! whip

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Ibuk Great indicator, thanks for sharing. There may be an unintended feature. Whe the ema changed to 5 it gives different readings as you change timeframes. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
hey would any body mind posting their demo or live results using this system. I hope somebody would do that so we can check the system accuracy.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi every one, here one of my win trades using this sistem, i took 38 pips, at this moment if steel on it i had 130!!, but it´s better some in my pocket.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Trading live. Took 12 trades starting this week on 1 hour chart.9 winners, 3 losers. Take profit is next S/R line, SL as per rules if candles closes below-above 24 Ema. +149 pips, -55 pips.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Sure Steve, go ahead, you know how to do that with eyes shut already! cpu load on this one will remain very low even with 23 pairs on the go. I don't think you need to grab the indicator's reading text labels, just bring the multi-pair code in-house. There's really just one small part of useful core code : void GetPairTrends(double &amp;diffs[][], int &amp;trend[][]) will get you all the "diff" values. I'm sure you already get all that. Sing out if anything is unclear. Sq

--- 帖子 #81 ---
should not; the indi doesn't care about the chart's TF. You may have witnessed just a mt4 history refresh glitch -- it may take some time for mt4 to grab the needed history for all pairs and TF to get the correct (and then stable) MAs. Once it shows decent values, it will keep them stable whatever pair or TF you load the indi on; Switching the chart's TF where the indi is alerady loaded won't affect the printed results; Same thing when changing the chart's pair (drag and drop the pair name from the "Market Watch" window to the chart) (in multi-pair mode of course). SQ

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Squalou. Would it be possible to have FFcal,added to the Robot, so that we can avoid having trade taken Min's before the news and so on,please. Only if you think it would be feasible,and not too much hard work. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
There are so many ffcal indicators out there. And ffcal generally hogs the system at least in my experience. Just use one of the many out there.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Here is eu trade that setup today. 1st trade: 50 pips was available for grab. 2nd trade: looking like it will be a looser. Its still on..lets wait and see what happens. There was a bounce trade based on the daily yesterday with entry @ 1.4309. I hope someone caught that. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Ibuks, Did EA took the first trade. Some reason EA didn't took the first trade, but i did took the 2nd trade which is -30 pips now... Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Ibuks, Do you recommend any session for this strategy? Thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Some people are like wow this is too simple it cannot work.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
No guarantee this is bug-free, so do not go using it on any live accounts yet. Having said that, I pinched most of the useful code from sq's indi so much of it is bug-free. This is a multi-pair trader, so you drag a single instance of the bot onto a chart - any chart. Once it receives the first tick, the code goes into an endless loop that repeats once a second. Click and drag the 'Stop the robot' label to stop trading, then repeat with the start label to restart trading. You do not need the dashboard on your chart for the ea to run; having it on the chart will help confirm that it is taking trades correctly. Trade entry BnB uses BufferPips to tell it when to send the limit order: Buy limit: market is the corridor between BufferPipsand BufferPips x 2 above the ema. Sell limit: market is the corridor between BufferPipsand BufferPips x 2 below the ema. Once the limit order is sent, BnB monitors the ema once a minute, and moves the fill price of the trade in line with the changing ema. Trade exit Winners TakeProfit Manual closure Use mptm for more sophisticated management Losers A candle opening and closing on the 'wrong' side of ema. StopLoss. The default is an emergency stop in case of cataclysmic events/loss of contact with the account. Manual closure. Multiple time frame trading By default, BnB offers the same PairsToTrade and time frames as does sq's dashboard. It is possible to trade all three default time frames, or any that you input into PeriodsToTrade, by leaving AllowMultipleTimeFrameTrades at its default of 'true'. Allowing mtf trading throws up the possibility of there being a lot of trades open - this method does not go short of trading opportunities on a single chart, let along multi-pair multi-tf. It may be necessary to limit the pairs that we trade; we shall see. On demo, just let things run and see what happens. It is possible that BnB might end up trading the same pair in one direction on a shorter tf and the opposite on a longer one. US citizens will not be allowed to do this. TP and SL considerations As coded, these are one-size-fits-all inputs. It may turn out to be desirable to have tp/sl settings that are relevant to the time-frame being traded. It would not be hard to add this feature Ibuks, so give it some thought. Keeping track of BnB trades There are magic number and trade comment inputs available for use; those of you familiar with my work know my attitude to the information these convey to the crims and my reluctance to use them. Using magic numbers would be an ideal way for BnB to know which trades it owns and what tf they are trading, to avoid duplication. I have avoided their use by evoking Global Variables instead. Global Variables are software files that live in your platform folders and hold information that EA's, scripts and indi's need. You can view them by pressing the F3 key. GV's used by BnB have the trade ticket number as their 'name' and store the trade's time frame as their value. BnB cleans up after itself regularly. Just be aware that MT4 is utter, total, unmitigated crap and is not totally reliable in keeping these files. Check regularly to ensure that each trade has an associated GV and create one if not - otherwise you risk trade duplication. In conclusion Ibuks, if you upload this to post 1, I suggest you add a link to this post so the instructions are always easily available. Ok, let's see if this puppy has a decent tail to wag. NB always download the EA from post 1 rather than here; post 1 will hold the latest version.

Wow that was fast Steve Time to take it for a test run

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi Steve, What more can I say. Thanks so much. I will add it to the frist post. Cheers

--- 帖子 #91 ---
IBFX do not have all the default pairs; both the EA and the dashboard need an extra line of code to deal with incorrectly-entered pairs. I have added this to the files in my previous post. Coders, go to void GetPairTrends(double &amp;diffs[][], int &amp;trend[][]) and to this: Inserted Code for(i=0; i&lt;NoOfPairs; i++) { for(j=0; j&lt;NoOfPeriods; j++) add the extra line of code here: Inserted Code for(i=0; i&lt;NoOfPairs; i++) { [b]if (iClose(TradePair[i], PERIOD_H1, 0) == 0) continue;[/b] for(j=0; j&lt;NoOfPeriods; j++) to both ea and dashboard, then re-compile.

Here is my set up, only the pairs as listed, set for 1 Hour trades, only demo, no trades yet, I don't have VPS and this is Friday so not much time left for trading... but looks good so far, thanks guys (you could sell this stuff)

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Great piece of work Steve.....This one has the flexibility to be a real gem... Have a great weekend whip

--- 帖子 #94 ---
LOL, who's idea was this???

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Do you think it was wise to enter that trade with major U.S. news out this morning and more to come? You may also want to reconsider your stop loss. Your Risk/Reward is crap. Good thing you're trading on demo.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Tell that to the programmer and / or the originator of this system Yes, on demo, just seeing how it works, got to learn somehow bit of catching up to do now

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Oh, by the way, just in case you think I'm a total idiot, here is the robot I really trust with real $$$ no problems with risk rewards here

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Which EA is this?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Not calling you an idiot, just merely suggesting some trades need to be skipped during major economic news. I'm sure you already know this. As for the R:R, I understand why it is there, but don't agree with it. I would rather take small, more frequent losers because they are easier to overcome with a few nice winners. Nice 2nd trade btw. Good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
No problem, never said you called me anything, but some reading this might get the wrong idea, here is an update, and a view of that trade, got real problems now, where to exit?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Having looked at a lot of trading methods, what Ibuk has done here is produced a trend trading method. Price goes below the MA when you are in a down trend and above the MA in an uptrend. So basically you are entering a trade into an established trend or thats what you should be doing. So let look at how we might improve the system, using what we know as traders. This is the first ideal set up to look for when a 24 MA crosses a 50 MA on the hourly, the trend is now down. So as this is the hour chart I am looking for hourly swings. My TP would be double my risk so I am risking 84 pips and targeting 168. I also want to see movement ie in swing depth see here price moved away from the 50 MA then returned to it all in all a 90 pip move, this is very important for the system otherwise you get caught in congestions where the market is ranging through the MA. I was wondering would a trend channel be a useful filter in terms of giving direction say placed on the last three swings?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Many thanks to Ibuk, Steve and Squalou for sharing their valuable knowledge, experience and wisdom with us - very much appreciated. To help me understand the system, I have coded a simple indicator showing the 24 EMA line with an envelope band set at a default of 20 pips away from it. Portions of the code came from Squalou's dashboard. When you move your mouse over the envelopes, it will pop up the pip setting and price. Hope you guys find this useful. Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Attached is the latest version. ShowStats tells the bot to display the data with which it is working. I could not make sq's indi code work for me, so I have adapted the column/row stuff from one of the Basket With ... Balls ea's. You can chose your own colours and column/row start etc, so experiment to find the settings that suit your eyes. The distance from the EMA display colours are the same as those of sq's dashboard - goodness knows how. 'Spr' is the individual pair's spread. I include this so we can start to think about how to use this information. A one-size-fits-all max spread is a bit of a nonsense in a multi-pair trader. Maybe we need a max spread by groups setting, to interdict a potential trade, and delete an unfilled pending, when this figure is exceeded during the run-up to a major news release. We shall see. SendIdentifyingComments allows us to send the time frame with the trade as a comment, so we can more easily tell which one triggered the trade. We will want to turn this off if this ea ever goes live. Optional Filters In recent weeks, I have picked up a couple of really useful hints re scalping: from mysticgenie: if the market is above yesterday's pivot then the bias is long, otherwise the bias is short. from Ibuks: if the market is above the H4 open price then the bias is long, otherwise the bias is short. I have made much use of these and found them to be helpful. I have included them here; UseH4 and UseD1Pivot are the inputs that control these; note they are 'true' by default, so you must opt to turn them off. ShowStats will show the values the ea is working with. The D1 pivot calculation is (High + Low + Close) / 3. Note to coders I have added a new function - bool OptionalFilters(string symbol, int type); this is called from within void LookForTradingOpportunities() and contains the filters I describe earlier. The function works by returning 'true' if all the optional filters stack up, or 'false' if not. The H4/D1 filters live here. It is easy to add your own fav filters by inserting a call into the new function. Have fun playing. In conclusion At default, this ea takes umpteen trades that swamp the senses. I am going to cut the trading pairs down this week, and restrict myself to H1/H4 tf's - the majors, gj and a couple of others perhaps. It could be that the best way of limiting trading is to introduce the usual balance etc filters from all my other bots. We shall see.

Great Stuff Steve, Innovation at it’s finest….And always love to see that spread indicator…. Have a great week whip

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Whaooo..... Steve, can I ever keep up with u?? Great update and idea. What a way to start a new month.... I did a quick backtest of EU daily and if tp is set @ 20 pips, you get 100% winning rate in the last 2 yrs. But I need to do more testing and forward testing to see how true this can be. if anyone is very goodt at testing/backtesting, pls speak up and lets work out something. I trade only eu, but with this, I will try to set it up to trade a few more pairs. Many thanks mate. Have a great trading week and month everyone.... Ibuks

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Ibuks, you evolve your systems purely to trade EU. They may well only work with EU. I write 'only' as though this is a criticism. It is not. If your systems 'only' work with EU, then that is all the rest of us need. Everyone else: no harm in trying to extend into other markets - just don't expect them to be successful. EU has its own characteristics that Ibuks understands better than the rest of us because he concentrates on that market. Time will tell whether his system also applies to other markets.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Steve, You may be right. However, I have been getting so many reports from my friends that trade other mkts and the results they get is also similar even sometime better than what i am getting. The weird thing is that with the same principle, i trade S&amp;P, FTSE and NQ and I get exact same result and that leaves me to guess that it may work on any mkt, however, we need to individually work out how to filter trades for the particular mkt we trade. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hello Steve, I think there is a small bug in line 1190 (change is marked bold red): Inserted Code //Potential sell trades if (type == OP_SELL) { //H4 open price if (UseH4) { price = GetH4OpenPrice(symbol); if (bid &gt; price) return(false); }//if (UseH4) //D1 pivot if (UseD1Pivot) { pivot = GetD1Pivot(symbol); if (bid [b][size=3][color=red]&gt;[/color][/size][/b] pivot) return(false); }//if (UseD1Pivot) }//if (type == OP_SELL)

Fixing the bloop that fxdaytrader spotted threw up another bloop in the comment-adding code. Fixed in the original post and here as well. If in doubt, try throwing your hands up in despair. Hey ho.

Hi, you have 2 emas on your chart...which one is 24ema? If the yellow is 24ema, then....looking at the last 4 or 5 red candles....then the following would have happened: 1. Trade 1 to go long would have closed in a loss. 2. Trade 2 to sell the retest of 24ema would have given well over 100 pips. Hope this explains it? Cheers

Hi folks, do you get any trades with the new multipair version? I loaded it yesterday on my charts but nothing happened so far... Strange. Best regards!

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi, I was just looking at how to post the trades from my VPS. I configured it for eu,gu, gy,ej,uj,NU and AU yesterday evening. Waking up this morning...it has performed not badly at all. I set the use 4hr and daily pivot to false and tp at 20 pips and trading H1, H4 and daily. Closed a total of 157 pips so far. Will try to figure out how to post it here soon. Not a bad start at all. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Very nice system, thanks to you and steve for sharing. I was running the multi - pair trader and also did quite well. I don;t know what happen or if it was just me, a couple of trades went up and touched the 24, but did not take the trade , as for a GU trade last night. I believe it did not cover the ask price. and I had a winner going on gj and it went up pass the - 20 pips and returned to the 24 , but sold the sell order at the -20 pips , when it had a 100 sl? any thoughts Thanks Again, fishman356

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Here is a trade I took. When the bearish candle was painting, I was already thinking that it will be a looser. I waited it out and got my pips. Dont be afraid of the mkt...lol. Sometimes, I get losses, but it all comes down to the individual.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Wow! Great thanks again to Ibuk and Steve for sharing this automated system. I turned on the Steve's latest EA (no customization) and woke up (about 8 hours later) with the following: 21 trades ====== 17 wins 4 losers total pips gain: 344 maximum dd: -59 Very impressive indeed!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
hi All, I receive this msg in the journal. 2011.08.03 00:24:53 Ibuks Bread'nButter multi-pair auto-trader by SteveHopwood NZDUSD,H1: zero divide Is this normal? How do i know that the EA is working?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Good and very impressive start. I guess you are running for all pairs...right?? If u are very good on backtest, could u pls run a well documented one for optimisation? This will be very useful. For the divide by zero error, pls ensure that u spell the name of the pair correctly. why not start by trying it on 1pair first and make sure u download the lastest one. Cheers. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Do you trade the 1 H TF ? Perhaps another question ... I noticed that the EA opens 2 limit orders and not only one, why is that the case ?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
for me it opened not only 2 but dozens limit orders per currency pair ... very strange thing !

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I have the same problem with two brokers' demo system. The message is saying that the system is trying to divide a number by zero. Since I know that Steve is pretty good at coding and testing, the fault must be with the system I am testing it on, so I downloaded another one and then the error disappeared. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi every one, can some body teach me how to up load the EA, i have the file but i don´t know how to use it. Thank all of you

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Yes, I am running the EA ootb as some would say, i.e. out of the box. Sorry, as I am pretty new at metatrader and have not done any backtesting - I much prefer forward testing as the results are closer to live trading. Could someone reading this rise to IBuk's challenge and share with us? I like Steve's latest EA very much - it has clear SL/TP on every trade and by the look of the results so far, has a risk:reward ratio of 2:1 with a high win:loss ratio of 4:1 - pretty good numbers. Good Trading all!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
hello compliments for the work can you do it with trailingstop and without take profit?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi Dortmunder, Steve's EA trades H1,H4 and D1 by default - see snapshot. The comments shows tf in minutes - 60 = H1. To show the comments, you have to right click the labels at the top and select or click comments. Currently, the EA is trading all the time frames on the pairs that Steve has chosen. No open trades at the moment. Cheers

--- 帖子 #128 ---
What did you actually mean? Do you mean attaching the EA to the chart ot uploading EA to this thread? If you mean uploading the EA to the thread then you can click manage attachments on thread options and then upload.

Has anyone had a problem with gbp/jpy , opening up a trade correctly? I just had a sell order fill at 125.860 and had a tp of 20 pips, the ea opened the tp with about 2 pip, I manually reajusted the tp for 20 pips , but it seems that has far as I can tell this is the only pair I had with opening and closing trades.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Thank for this, i just up load the EA to my Chart, i want to ask, how can i change the number of lote? i want to trade 1L and the EA have 0.01. Thank´s again for your help

Excellent EA. Complimnets to IBUKS for the system and Steve Hopwood for the multitrader. I have encountered a problem with the Ea in that it is constantly opening multiple instances of trades on any time frame Does anyone have the same expereience? Does anyone know how to solve this problem? Nicastro

--- 帖子 #132 ---
The ea performed brilliantly again over the night closing 127pips. With this kind of performance, we may kiss manual trading goodbye...lol. But hopefully, mkt maker will not get this attention...lol. A word of advice to new traders: 1. Pls read the 1st post very well to avoid unnecessary questions. 2. If u are new to using EA, pls read some manuals/websites etc on how to use an EA. 3. Don't jump to trading it on live account. Forward test the EA, try and take the trades manually, understand the concept very well before making the bold step. Happy trading ...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Ibuks and everyone, Thanks for sharing your system, thanks too to Steve and Sq (merci beaucoup) for their wonderfull tools. I´m forward testing Multipair EA (OOTB), but this morning I had 3 big losses, with CHF pairs, I mean 130 pips each loss and TP set at 30 pips. Before deleting some pairs, I want to change some settings. I have noticed too better results with H4 than H1. So I´m testing now with hard SL=TP=50 pips, all pairs, H1, H4 and Daily. Let´s see how it goes....... Thanks again

--- 帖子 #134 ---
@Nicastro @Ibuks So what to do with the issue of constantly opening multiple instances of trades ? What's going wrong ?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Caillou..Which CHF pair had a 130 SL? Can you post a chart please? Thanx

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Interesting! I have much better results with H1 than H4. Results based on forwarding testing 1 day with default setting: 9 wins for H1 2 wins + 1 loss for H4 (net loss) 1 loss for D1 I took a closer look at the H4 loss which is on EURCAD H4. Over the displayed period(see chart attached), it showed 3 bounces and 5 pass-throughs, i.e. system does not work well in this picture. I am removing H4 and D1 trades from today to see how well it trades now. Good Trading to all!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Thanks Galen for posting these results. I am running it on EU,GU, EJ,NU,UJ,and AU on H1, H4 and daily. So far so good. If anyone is getting errors, pls read post 1 and also read Steve's comment on the EA. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi, Sure. I don´t remember exactly the third pair, it was a demo account deleted now and I´m running a new demo account with new settings but we have EUR/CHF H1 -122 pips and GBP/CHF H1 -163 pips. That´s why I´m testing now TP=SL=50 with H4 and Daily. Attached the charts

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Obviously, I would avoid taking these trades in live account because of CHF news at this time, but with or without news, I like more a best R:R.........

--- 帖子 #140 ---
There will be always spikes. News time or not. I am having better results by using 1 Atr for a SL and 2 X Atr as TP. Waiting for a candle open and close above, below the 24 Ema will bring big losses sometimes.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I agree with you, for me a possible SL= 2, 3, 4 or 5 X TP is totally unacceptable, but that's only my way of trading......

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Awesome EA, thanks to Ibuks, Squalou and Steve for making this possible: I'll try to give back my two cents by sharing my tests: I'm setting up 5 demos: - Default Pairs - EURNZD and AUDNZD (Too high spreads for my broker) Demo 1: No filters on; 30 pip TP and SL Demo 2: No filters on; 1.5xATR SL and 1xATR TP Demo 3: H4 Filter on; 30 pip TP and SL Demo 4: D1 Filter on; 30 pip TP and SL Demo 5: H4 Filter on; 1.5xATR SL and 1xATR TP Would anyone suggest any additions/modifications in order to make this test the most productive? I'll upload these demos to myfxbook account for you guys to see and track.

--- 帖子 #143 ---

Hello Galen. I like to comment on your chart which you claim was a loser on the H4 chart. You could actually make 330 pips with a proper money management. Please take a look at my chart and see for yourself how important MM is. Can you see how losing trades can turn to winners??

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi, Can u pls add just one more on the demo if it will not be too much of a problem. Add one demo with tp =20 pips and H4 and Daily pivot set to false. I will greatly appreciate this. Many thanks. Happy Trading

Hi The7, Your idea of fibs look great. Can u pls share how u do this...am sure it will be of great benefit to all. Thanks. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hello Squalou/Steve hopwood/all developers, Could someone help me modify squalou dashboard with few additional information? If we could have two more columns and display no of pips from open (i.e. EU moved +30 from daily open and GU moved +50 from daily open) and high/low of a pair for the day? The above information will help intraday traders to quickly know which pair has got good volume going and look for pullback to 24EMA and quickly target those pairs. Hope someone can include those to the dashboard. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Ibuks...I do use the Fib tool but the values have nothing to do with the Fib levels. I use Atr for my SL and TP's. With this tool, it is easy to measure distances from Entry to TP or SL. Go to Fib properties, use Level 0-Description Entry, Level1-Description SL, Level-1 Description X1, Level-2 Description X2. If say the Atr is 25, drag the SL from your entry 25 pips away, it automatically will tell you your 50 pips(2xAtr) level, or whatever your TP you like to choose..Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi The7, Thanks for commenting. I agree with you that a proper money management system with a positive expectation like what you are proposing is the way to go. If I am not wrong, the robot would have had 3 more SLs, however you will still net +165 pips off that chart. (2 X 4) + (-1 X 5) = 3 ATRs or 165(3x55) pips. Acostafulano, many thanks for sharing your forward testings with us, could you also include one with The7's settings. We would all be also very thankful if you could also give us your comments on how the various settings are doing from time to time. I have been using the default setting for SL and TP so far, would you share with us the code for CalculateTakeProfit and CalculateStopLoss that uses ATR? I would like very much to try The7's way for today. According to Mark Douglas, the Holy Grail to consistent winnings is executing perfectly a plan with an edge and money management - this could be it! Once again, many thanks to Ibuk, Steve and everyone here for sharing this very promising system.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello, can anyone help me to modify squalou's dashboard with below information? It could be very useful for other as well. Pips to open and high/low information is very profitable if you trade them properly.

hi steve i noticed that pips number for sl and tp are not the same for all the pairs, i mean i set tp 100 and sl 100 sometimes it stop at 10 pips and tp at 10 pips also, maybe because of the digits number on every cross...can you have a look ?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
well does one outweigh the other or is it 50 50 ?

Hi The7, what is the second line on your chart and how do you use it? Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #171 ---
The robot turned to the dark side! Multiple SLs on GBPUSD H1. Interesting that it has been behaving well for 3 days, then turned wild last night, give us lots of pip candies, then took it away just as fast, was there some event yesterday that spooked the robot? Fascinating!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
The second red line is a 50 Ema. Prices usually respects that line as much it does the 24. It gives me an idea of the overall trend.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
[quote=Galen;4843512]The robot turned to the dark side! Multiple SLs on GBPUSD H1..../quote] I can`t see "your" dark side... see attached, an actual screenshot. it nearly trippled the account since yesterday ;-) it is H1 only with a TP of 20 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi everyone In reply to Galen and Sgt.forex, could you please post the settings you are currently using? I want to understand if the differing EA behaviour from user-to-user is due to differences in settings, or differences in broker behaviour/price feed differences/other factors. I stoppped the bot yesterday because of some odd trade decisions. If we're all aligned on settings for a week or so, then we should be able to make some headway in identifying why the EA produces different results for some. Daft question also: Is everyone using the latest-and-greatest version? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
[quote=Sgt.forex;4843605] You dont see the dark side because you not looking at the pair(G/U) he was trading and had multiple losses.

It is not the system that has failed. It is a pair ot the Ea that started acting crazy. Thats why I dont trade live with EA's

[quote=Sgt.forex;4843605] Here you go... I have underlined the trade for you. Goes to show we need to be very careful with using EAs - it behaved on your platform, behaved for a few days on mine, then it went berserk! I agree with The7 that we should be cautious, we need to be keep testing the EA on the platform extensively before going live. Gremlins in the system?

@ Galen Interestingly, the rapid mutiple trades that ended in profit and the similarly rapid trades than ended in loss were all sells. This suggests to me that there is an issue with the sell side logic - perhaps a copy paste error? I will take a look, but I'm sure Steve will be able to spot it quickly. Invisible

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks Invisible, that is a pretty logical assumption. I am also looking at the mq4 double precision problem mentioned here : http://forum.mql4.com/14834 My current thinking is that there is a problem with the expression (TradeTf == tf) in the function DoesTradeExist(string symbol, int tf) as I am only using H1. I was about to print out the variables to see for myself if there are the same when trading stopped. I will spent some time learning strategy tester this weekend to see if I can print out these 2 variables during a run. Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
@ Galen I think comparing buy and sell logic may well reveal the issue. Invisible

--- 帖子 #182 ---
As programmed, Matt's O_R_CheckForHistory function gives up trying after x attempts to make an EA wait until the latest trade shows up in the trade history. I overrode this in the past, but appear to have lost this overriding - something to watch out for if any of you are using my EA shell as well as all my recent work. I have re-introduced code to overcome this. Have a look at bool SendSingleTrade(string symbol, int type, string comment, double lotsize, double price, double stop, double take) and see if you think this will do the job.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thanks Steve for the quick response and new code. Have a great weekend!

I wanted to share this trade taken yesterday, Friday evening. I took the trade in the pic using a buy limit and went out for a meeting. My reason for taking the trades are as follows: 1. 24ema bounce (Bread trade ) 2. 1.4150 are has been a strong support for a while I came back later in the day around 9:00pm (uk time) to see green. Will u call this luck or rookie's luck. All I will say is trade your plan and plan your trade. Have a great weekend. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Ibuks, thanks for sharing. Tested it a bit and of course last week was bad because of these crazy moves up and down but under "normal" marketconditions the system really works out. I set a SL of 30 pips and 10 pips TP, quite good but as I said not last week (of course). Next week I won't trade it either until market calms down a bit, crazy moves rihgt now, Jack

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I try to attach the dashboard but doesnt work only for current pairs not on all pairs could somebody explain why

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Nice setup for the first trade of the week. Entered with 2 lots. Will close 1 lot when it reaches 1 Atr, will let other lot run. Wish a bunch of pips for everyone for this week. Update 1: Price hit my 1 Atr, so I closed 1 lot with +37 pips. I will let second lot run. Update 2: Price closed above 24 Ema, so I closed the remaining second lot. Good Money Management can turn a losing trade to a winner. +23 pips and trade closed.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Here is another open trade from last week. Closed 1 lot already, so it is a free trade. +90 pips and counting.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
It's correct? thanks

--- 帖子 #190 ---
correct?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
suggestion? it's good pending order at 1.4278?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
For real? Used the OOTB ea with stunning results last week. Also starting a test with other important ma's this week, should be interesting.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi esquire, sorry but I didn't test it back last week but I tested it back now til 2011/01/11 here are the results: (1 hour trading, may be in real slightly better but not much because I used 1 hour candles but the tendency is clear) You should avoid trading one hour and a half before us open (dow jones open) ( I slipped it from the test to get better results) Then the trading results are follows with 10 pip TP und 30 pips SL and enter on hit the EMA 24 (so it'S bounce trading: If it comes from high on EMA24 then long and SL 30 pips under the EMA24 and TP above 10 pips of EMA24): Gain 1140 (114 trades) Lost 1020 Pips (34 trades) CR: 1,12 (without spread costs) That's far from good. I think you have to think about lots of other stuff to get good profit from that. Always remember: If you test a strategy test at least half a year to become results. For example the last 3 month were a bit better than Jan to Apr. May be the Author of this thread can tell a bit how to "select" trades. Greets Jack

--- 帖子 #194 ---
As most trading systems here: The key for success is the selection of the trade. The system alone mechanical doesn't work well. Yes you get profit if you trade at least half a year but you need additional filters. Look at Danyjoe Pic last post . See the problem ? Hour of trade is good, downdrive is ok, may be a bounce may be not. That'S the problem. Right now it worked out before SL 30 so it was a good one (chances were mechanically 55% equaled on 30SL/TP 10) . I admire the author of this thread if he is profitable with this strategy last years but it would be great if he could show the WIN/LOST ratio... I think it will be under 1.5 and that's ok but not outstanding. Mechanically without 1 and half hour before Dow Jones Open it's 1.10-1.15 .... greets Jack The beginning pic (CHART PAGE 1) is a phase were the system performs very well (also at my backtest) but it's only a short time frame !!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I've tested this ea to short to give you a well fundmented opinion. But as you can see in my results I have to say the system is very impressive untill now. I'll have to keep testing a couple of weeks to make sure it's that good, but i think a 6 month period is a bit too much. The fact that this system seems to work now may be result of certain market conditions, which might change somewhere in the future. Is it just me or isn't the ea mking any trades today by the way?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Do you really see a losing trade in a trading system as a "Problem"? Dannyjoe's 1st trade (U/C) is a big winner with 80 pips+ and counting. His second chart (U/Chf) turned to be a loser for him because he entered late. I entered the same pair few hours earlier and made +27 pips. Third chart which is the E/U was the only loser here. It always come to good money management. Cut your losses short, let your winners run.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi The7, no of course you are right. You cannot avoid losts but you can change parameter to tight SL and BIG TP still not gaining anything because of changing in chances. The C/R ratio on a trade say nothing about the outcome (eg. 30 TP / 10 SL 3:1) you can make it even 30 TP / 5 SL still no gain because the system is not working. (The one here works but not very well as I said 1,1: 1 but it's really hard to find a good one so I appreciate a lot that people share their thoughts here and their Ideas !) I try to analyze it the hard way. It has to stand different market conditions, than it's good. Greets Jack

--- 帖子 #198 ---
What's the mistake? someone can help me? thanks

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I have seen many good systems here on FF, being trashed because of EA's. People just turn on the EA, go fishing, come back in a week and look at there results:" Nah, this system doesnt work, look at the results". Ea's are good only when you manage them. Why would you leave the EA running if Bank of Japan intervenes the market, or any other major development happens? It doesnt work that way folks..Not fair to any system..

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Sometimes catching a signal late is a good thing. My red line is the 50 Ema, prices loves those lines just as it likes the 24 Ema. Short here with 2 lots, will close 1 lot when it reaches 1 Atr. Update 1 : That was quick. Price hit my 1 Atr, so I closed 1 lot with +33 pips. I have a free trade now. Will let it run.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi The7, how do you use the red line? may you write me some suggestion obout my today entries? on this page and previous?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Danyjoe, I wrote my opinion about your previous trades. You only had 1 loser with the E/U trade. Your last trade is a valid signal as well. Just make sure to use proper MM. If you do this you will prevail, I promise. My 50 Ema red line works great. It is just another S/R line that price respects.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
ok thanks Can I upload my charts.. and sometime you comment? I'm not using the EA now ... I want to learn manually.. with a good MM .. I'm learning what's the mistake in EU?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
There is no mistake in the E/U. You can not always win. You will have losers, it is a part of the game. Make sure when you lose, you lose small and win big..

--- 帖子 #205 ---
ok, i'm using fibonacci like in the photo of the chart... for SL and using e-trailing.. whitout TP ok?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Not sure what e-trailing is.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
advice not to use e-trailing?

I dont know what e-trailing is, never heard of it...

It's like letting your lawnmower go in a straight line, expecting it to mow your entire lawn and then being extremely surprised when it just runs to the other end of your garden and crashes into the fence. And I am not speaking about those scary Husqvarna autonomic robot types.

maybe I explained evil I did not realize that this post was direct to me .. I meant what was wrong I have done... In the Manual entry was not made ​​by EA that entry.. but from me I'm sorry for the misunderstanding

268 pips in 2 hours.....(with trailing stop..) great system! I hope that was not just luck see tomorrow....

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Danyjoe, great trades, well done! What settings do you use on the e-trailing EA? And how do you set your SL and TP 1/2 with the fib. retracement tool (values)? Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi I dont use the EA.. the Fibo are 0, 1, 2.618 and 4.236 good lucky

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Ok, thanks for the information. Then you used the Metatrader trailing stop...what pip settings did you take?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I'm still trying... and some work .. but not very well if you find a good one let me know that we test it together

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hmmm...just one more question for understanding: As seen in your charts before you had the e-trailing EA on your charts (top right)...so you used it or not?? A little confused now...

--- 帖子 #218 ---
dont works.. sometimes go and sometimes not.. maybe write me in private about e-trailing.. to not go OT

--- 帖子 #219 ---
We should stay away from trades like these. To many long wicks no direction whatsoever. Same thing goes for the E/U since last of July.

If the 1.0100 support line breaks, I might need extra storage for my pips :-) Already +115 pips and best of all, risk free trade.

First, I will like to say thanks to The7 for posting all his trades. As it is with any system, u need to own it and practice trading it manually to fully understand how u can adjust it to ur personality. The7, U are doing great and I am very impressed. So far, this week has been full of volatility with great opportunities so far. The dashboard has also given me the opportunity to start looking at other pairs with ease. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
i try many times to install the dashboard by FXDD but the dashboard doesnt work i put in indicators but doesnt work could somebody tell me why

--- 帖子 #229 ---
My short entry was a bit late but that's ok. 1 lot closed already, so it is a free ride. Who doesn't like that right? Update 1: Still in the trade. +64 pips so far. Free, risk free trade.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Took another short few minutes ago. Already in the green zone. I had 2 trades this morning, both ended with BE. First priority is:" Protect your capital, worry about profits later" Update 1: Price reached my 1st target, so closed 1 lot. Free ride too. Update 2: Price hit SL. But because I closed 1 lot before the SL, ended up breakeven.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
It is 11.30 pm here in Vancouver. So I better get some sleep. Green pips to everyone.

maybe it's better also to play the break , a reverse signal function can do the job......

hi there can you please tell me where is 24ema indicator on meta trader 4

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Closed my Usd/Jpy short trade. 1st lot +22 pips, 2n lot +34 pips.Total 56 pips.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
opened now what do you think?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I dont think price touched the 50 Ema. I entered the U/Chf earlier with the 24 bounce.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Closed this short trade with -17 pips loss. No need to wait till it hits my initial SL because price closed-opened above the 24 Ema. I like to cut my losses short.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Playing the break means catching the trade from the start. This is how most of us lose. It is safer to jump in after it starts, at least for me.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
are you running the ea ? or trading manually ? which tp/sl do you apply ?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi The7, do you think is best to enter just the price touches the Ema or when he gave a sign of reversal after a few pips? Here you would be entered on black line or green? thanks

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I am trading manually. Would never trade live with an EA.TP and SL is arbitary. I use 1 Atr as my SL.Enter with 2 lots, close 1 lot when price reaches my 1 ATR TP and let the second lot run till I feel. I get lot of BE trades but once I catch the big wave its 500-600 pips.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I dont trade reversals Dany. Just because price changed direction does not mean we have a new trend. But again, see what fits best for you. I wouldnt take the E/N trade. One the spread is too high, second on your chart price has no direction.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Entered short with touch of 50 Ema. Love to have a big wave before weekend. Update 1: Before I enter a trade, I always make sure if there is a trend on the daily charts. there are different ways to to it. Checking the Daily Rsi and making sure it is not between the 45-55 levels is one way. My GU trade shows 44 Rsi, so we might bump into a range but who knows.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
You can call me insane to ask a question like this but: "No matter what system you use, why are short trades safer than long ones.?" I asked this questions to myself since I met the Forex market:-) Is it physics???

--- 帖子 #247 ---
i would like to add the chance to take the break ( cross ) of the ema , so just the opposite... i found that this one works great when markets are ranging , but losing when they are trending, there are always pips after ema cross...don' t you think ?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Umm it's easier to fall than to climb? That's my best guess lol

--- 帖子 #249 ---
excuse my ignorance, 2 questions how do I see the daily RSI? how do you chosen in this chart the entry point and the SL? thanks

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Just put a Rsi on the daily chart, set levels to 44-55. If Rsi is between these levels it is said that price has no trend, so it is ranging. We want to stay away from those trades. My SL is based on 1xAtr.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
sorry but I am really newbie RSI=Relative Strength Index?? period? 10?? close?? What is 1xAtr?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Danny with all due respect I encourage you to go back to the basics before looking for any trading system. babypips.com is a good start. Thanks

--- 帖子 #253 ---
ok ok sorry you're right. now i found it, I will make some attempt with periods

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I guess, never had the feeling anyway Thanks steve and ibuk for this wonderfull simple system. It is going for non-stop profit ever since i put the ea on a chart.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
which are your settings ? tp and sl mainly

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi esquire, I tested the EA but took it off after a week as it was giving me consistent losses. How do you have yours set up?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Just look at my test: http://www.myfxbook.com/widget?id=14...=1&amp;color=green settings are TP=20 SL=100

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Same here, OOTB, force yourself not to look for one day and BAM!: profit Also like the fact - in contrast with steve's other profitable ea's, that this one uses a stoploss and thereby doesn't force you into a moment where you have to decide wheter to hedge, recover etc. Just decide to take the trade or not - or also let the ea do that part -, then the manage part is already pretty much worked out for you. Although i think some trailing stop does have quite some potential here instead of a static tp, will look at that later.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
@esquire @Sgt.forex Which EA version you use to get these impressive results and gains ? Any link to the post in this thread ? Or much easier it would be if you could post your EA/setfile ? I tried it but can't get good results so far ?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
@Sgt, esquire: Please let me get this clear from your setup. As I mentioned, got nowhere near that performance: - The EA is the one currently on post 1? -Is this performance OOTB, only changing TP:20 SL:100??, -everything else (all the default pairs, and H1,H4 and D1 Tf's) unchanged from OOTB? Please let me get this clear so I can set up a couple of demos and from there start tweaking and testing myself, Thanks

--- 帖子 #261 ---
It's the one from this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...95#post4844195 The other ones are sending the same trade multiple times. However steve changed something that stopped the bot from working, so i modded it a bit (see attached). That should work. I use tp = 30 btw. Note: just caught a couple of bad trades whiping almost all todays profit. It's no holy grail, it's just good

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I want no holy grail, I just want a good bot T_T Thanks a lot for your reply. Do you have your test on myfxbook?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Nope. Have to tell you that i didn't tested it fully for the last weeks, but a couple of times a run of several days, all in profit at the end. I think Sgt.forex' myfxbook tells the story however...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
It seems so, I'll set up a demo and share the link with you guys. @Sgt.Forex: I have a question tho... how come you got some trades that closed @ 22, +50, +70 pips if your TP was 20? could that be slippage in your favor?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
putting multi pairs functionality with multi time frame one in one code seems like a masterpiece to me.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hello traders, Hope u all had a great week. I have been looking at the idea suggested by The7 and I must admit that it is a brilliant idea. The idea is to use the hrly ATR as sl and then project using the fib tool to get the TP. Here is a trade I took just a few minutes ago. The ATR was 30 pips, I projected for TP1 as 150% from entry, TP2 as as 200% from entry etc...with reference to the ATR. The picture explain it better. I believe this can really help determine your risk before taking the trade and can be an alternative to my time based SL. I will try and explain this to Steve and see if we can incorporate it as an option in the EA. If squalou is around, is it possible to incorporate this into the dashboard? If yes, it will be an excellent tool. Many thanks. Thanks The7...great job. Keep it coming. Happy trading and have a lovely weekened. Ibuks

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Esquire, Thanks for the mod, will give it a try. I had nothing significant to report this week as the new robot did not trade as much for me. Did you get any trade multiple times after your mod? Nice trading The7! Have a great weekend all!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Guys, and IBUK in particluar- I wanted to thank you - this system truly rocks. I have been trading it manually of the past few days and I can say its ONE of the ways forward. I've sat here with an erection for most of the day. I was trading pippo before this and I uploaded the MM indictor which I left on there by accident, before adding the EMA line. Between these two indicators, I now have something which tells me when to enter the market (EMA line) and the probability of a bounce (depending upon where the market is in relation to the lines on the mm indicator - i know its not meant for that but I use it for that along with determining the size of my trades). The only improvement needed to the multi trading EA is a problem I am having with limit orders being constantly modified. The only thing we need now is something to help us eliminate the 'change in trend' issue. Also, i think the fibo/ATR suggestion given before will also add to the completion of this wonderful system. Well done guys.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
The "Change in Trend" issue, is actually not an issue. It is a fact that will be always present in the trading world. We don't know and never will know what will happen next. But if price moves in one direction and we have a retrace to the Ema, what is more likely to happen next you think? Obviously price will continue in the direction where it came from. We bet for probabilities. We don't predict. Surely price can continue towards the retrace and have a direction change. But this is less likely. Any type of filter, indicator will not change this fact. Losses will be always there. If we can't give to the market, we should not expect to have something back. If you insist on a confirmation once price hits the 24 ema on the 1 hour, go down to the 15 min. chart and watch the price. But again if you wait for a smaller timeframe confirmation, you might lose pips. TP and SL is arbitrary. Use your own style. I like to use 1 Atr for now but nothing is written in stone. More importantly for me is when I enter a trade, to BE first and worry about profits later.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I hear you buddy and I agree. Although there are indicators which tell us when a trend is about to run out of steam, this simple system is enough to generate a reasonable number of profitable pips. Thanks for taking the time out and replying anyway.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I like to summarize some strength points about this system. Which I personally believe gives us high probability trades. 1-We do not try to catch a trend from the start. Most systems fail because their idea is to jump into the trade from the beginning. Price unfortunately is more ranging then it is trending. This is why we get lots of losses. With this system, we wait for the trend to form and enter only on a retrace which is the best entry for whatever system you use. 2-We follow the trend and not trade against it. Most retrace systems are counter-trend systems and are too risky. 3-It can be used in any market. Might it be commodity, stocks etc. 4-It can be used in any timeframe. The longer the better surely. I like the 1 hour. Managing SL's on daily's do not fit my style. 5- You can trade this system from any computer without the need of having a platform like the Mt4. From your office, gym etc. 6- No lagging indicators. Please feel free to add your own input. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I do not know if this may interest you .. these are my yesterday and today trades, I'm trading with Ibuks rules in first page, looking when the price is 20 pips above or under the EMA and taking 10 pips in bounce.. Of 15 trades.. 13 positive! Since I look many cross.. I use the EA to help me to follow all.. I use the EA only to help me to find the set up.. when it warns of a possible set-up I control that the prices respect the ema, I control that 24Ema and 50Ema are parallels and if the bounce will go long or short, beacuse the EA often puts them in the opposite side. everything is equal and the same of rules described by Ibuks I just added the EA to help me keep everything under control If you are interested I keep you updated on next week

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Great results Danny. Just make sure to watch your EA once in a while. Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Ibuks mentioned he had traded this strategy successfully for three years. And the tp in the original strategy is 10+ pips, not fixed 10 pips. So if you backtest it using fixed 10 pips, the system may not work. and it's also hard to write a EA because the tp rules are not clear. The tp' rule is not clear, everyone can get different result in the same trade. About The7's system, sl=1*ATR, tp=1*ATR and 2*ATR. It's clear. have anybody backtested this? what's the results.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I have back tested trading this strategy with 10 pips profit and stop as per instructions on first page and it just ends up break even. As soon as you think you are making a profit a large stop comes and wipes it all out. That is the results for this SIMPLE system. If you are making a profit my guess it you are not following instructions on the main page but have complictaed the system which goes against the instructions. My opinion is that this system as stated on the front page will not result in profit.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Ibuks has asked me to add ATR stop loss and take profit, so here it is. It is impossible to give users a lot of inputs flexibility in a multi-pair, multi-tf robot. You have a sl multiplier and a tp multiplier, and can specify the Atr period and shift. Also, I have not been able to check the code as multi-pair ea's cannot be tested in strategy tester. Sing out if bugs surface tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Thanks Steve and welcome back. Will put it on the first page once I get home. To answer to some of the reservations expressed by some traders on the 10+ pips issue and the sl, pls read below carefully. When I said 10+ pips, I meant 10 pips or more. I hope that is clarified now? On the sl, this is a time based exit strategy which some traders are not disciplined enough to follow or even understand. The bread and butter like I said in my first post is not for everyone. If u are not ready to own it, practice and bring out how u trade it to suit ur own personality, u will only be wasting ur time. If u will spend time to trade and watch this simple strategy, u will notice that it sometimes catches the beginning of a trend/ reversals. 2 Fridays ago, I showed an example of how I used a 16 pip sl to catch almost 150 pips reward. The idea brought up by The7 is an option and I believe it came out of The7 taking ownership of the system to map out what is brilliant for him and also great for sharing it. That is why I requested for it to be incorporated into the ea. We can only know the effect after testing it. Finally, I trade the strategy personally with multiple lots and I believe our risks differs. When I initially asked Steve to help out with an ea, I told him exactly how I was trading it but the issues of taking multiple lot sizes on mt4 made us settled for a single trade. I understand however that the same thing can be achieved using mtpm from Steve. Don't ask me how...pls as I don't know myself. I still trade manually and the ea is really helping me to start looking at trading more pairs with the strategy. Sup/res also play a major role in all these. Combine sup/res to this simple strategy and u will not be far from a successful trading strategy. I hope this answer the concerns. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Never had the intention to take ownership of this thread. Sorry if I made it look this way. Ibuks showed us how to make money with pointing out a very easy S/R line. How we manage this money is up to the individual. Use what best suits you and manage your TP and SL's accordingly. Nothing is written in stone.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
This is not what Ibuks meant - the opposite in fact. What he was describing was how you have 'taken ownership' of his system for yourself - you have adapted it to your own personal trading style. He is congratulating you for having done so. It is the failure of individuals to take ownership of the umpteen systems offered here at FF that means most traders are unsuccessful in following them. As a general thingy guys, always read the thread starter's posts with care. Skimming them generally leads to mis-understanding. Guess how I know?

Hi The7, You are doing very well and taking ownership of the system is what i meant not taking over the thread. To be candid, I don't even mind at all if u take ownership of the thread. The whole idea here is to be able to share and contribute to the community. By sharing, u get better insight and contributions from others and the system can even get better. The7...I congratulate u in the way u have adapted the system to suit ur personality and I encourage u to pls go ahead and don't let anything stop u. Ride on mate.

Hello! I am a Newbie in this, only trading for 4 months, but I follow most thread in this forum with enthusiasm... (and I am getting less and less sleep becasue of it!). My question is for SteveHopwood, who does most of those interesting EAs, or someone else with MT4 programming capabilities, like Squolou with his excelent dashboard: Is there a way to add other stuff to this Indicator? I mean, I can add Gold and Silver besides the usual Forex currencies, but I can't find a way of add US_Oil/UK_Oil, or CFD Indexes like AUS200 or US30. Of course I tried to add "AUS200" to the "Pair to Trade", but without positive results. I know that they are too volatile and dangerous etc, but an experiment would hurt much in a demo account. Thank you.

Hi Steve &amp; Ibuks, Many thanks again for sharing. The latest robot seems to be ticking along now. As I was watching the CADJPY H1 pair, it seems that I would have taken a long position manually as the bid price retraces back to the 24EMA. It was also above the H4 open and D1 pivot - see attached. However as the spread for the pair is 6 pips, it was never triggered as the ask price never reached it - the ask line is 6 pips away on the chart) Sell limit orders are fine as they would hit the bid price to open - it only affects buy limit orders as the chart only shows bid prices. Ibuks, I know you said on the first page to set the buy limit at the 24EMA value, should we add the spread to the buy limit orders or leave it as is? Have a great week trading guys!

Dunno whats wrong here for me - but the bot from post #261 is opening multiple trades (10-20 per currency pair) - broker: GOMarkets (Europe) - on the other hand the last bot from post #276 doesnt open any trade: Broker IBFX AU ? So whats wrong ?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
same for me , don't open trades, i am with alpari uk

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Good morning! Taken 20 pips a few minutes ago with eurusd and eurjpy now I'm still waiting for EURJPY and EURUSD like in pics

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Just a thought but have you changed the default setting of DisplayOnly_NotTrading from true to false? I had same problem so made the change, not taking any trades as of yet as the conditions are not right but from the code if set to true will not look for trades. Hope this helps Mike

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I was watching this setup, but didn't enter. What other confirmation did you have to buy? Was it only the EMA24 crossover?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi, i just read the hole thread and made my first demo-trades (one winner, one loser). for me the biggest problem is a suitable target and sl. the original sl could be very much if something happens in this crazy fx-world. the idea with the adr is a nice thing but doesnt give me a nice feeling in the moment (because lot of range markets so the movement is missing). the problem with the 100 sl and 10 or 20 target is after some winners if you have one loser.... does anybody has a good idea for that? but the "system" is nice and easy. i like it sorry for my english. its only school-english and a long time ago thanks tom

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I think it's a retracement model..maybe can give better results combine with other indicator like Fib ? so it have confluence factor before we enter the trade..just my idea anyway.. Good luck

--- 帖子 #290 ---
guys.. something strange has just happened - the overall trend of e/d is up (W, D and H). However, a sell limit was generated on my demo and filled earlier today (which has now been stopped out at a loss). Is this a possible bug with the autotrader EA?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
First of all, many thanks to Ibuks, Steve, Squalou &amp; The7 for putting together what looks like a very exciting EA. I've found a trait that might become a problem, paticularly with smaller brokers. With all pairs enabled, the EA is sending 4+ order modification requests per second. Is there any chance we can sleep that process 30 seconds or so? Possibly make it a variable to allow a trader to a ccommodate a criminal that continues to complain. I haven't received a nasty-gram from my broker yet, but I'm pretty sure they're working on it. Thanks!! Franko

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Dont think criminals will start complaining about that. Anyway, easy to solve, open de mql code and search for Sleep(1000);//One second And change the 1000 into something else (30000 if you want a 30 sec sleep for example) @warsteiner72 thought about this, but ddon't know a good solution yet. I did came to the conclusion that the 100 pip sl should almost never get hit - i did a couple of times with me, but that was caused by a broken internet connection. The close position if closed, opened and closed under the ma like described in post 1 will almost always do the trick, the other sl is just in case the market goes wild. About tp, i think trailing should do a good trick here, i don't know what kind of trailing, perhaps a shifted short ma (SMA 10 shift 5 or similar). Sometimes it catches the start of a good trend, where trailing can convert 30 pip profit into 200. Well, lots of stuff to think about Anybody already tried running the ea multiple times on the same platform? Want to try other important ma's like the ones in ken's topic, but the platform crashes right after adding the second bot. Any solutions? Cheers

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi Steve, Trading seems to be working well - 11 trades since I started yesterday, 6 wins, 5 losers, 100 pips gain. There may be bugs in the calculations of SL and TP. Of the 11 trades, 5 have TP Multiplier of less than 1, it should be closer to 2. I have examined 2 pairs in particular, although profitable, both have TP Multiplier of less than 1 (see yellow highlights in attached): EURJPY: EXPECTED ATR SL 0.27, ACTUAL SL 0.40 EXPECTED ATR TP 0.54, ACTUAL SL 0.32 EXPECTED TP MULTIPLIER 2, ACTUAL 0.80 EURCAD: same issues, both would have hit the expected TP. Looking at the code, ATR was calculated fresh for both SL and TP, could this be where the bugs are? In spite of this, the robot is chugging along fine.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I will call this EU trade my winner trade for the day. I set a buy limit @ the 24ema, went out for about 2 hrs. Came back to get over 150 pips closed (1lot closed for 15 pips, another lot closed for 100 pips and another closed for 150 pips). I still have a small one running with 50 pips trailing. This is the kind of trade we all pray for. But do they happen everytime?... NO. However, they happen often. The key is to keep at it until u can master the way u can best play it. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
If you're playing with your B&amp;B settings, you'll find yourself deleting a lot of pending orders. I found this EA... http://codebase.mql4.com/7731 You HAVE to go through all of the options, set Magic Number to 0 &amp; save a .set file (couldn't upload my .set file for some reason) for it to work properly. Hope this helps! Franko

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Good trade Ibuks!, i would like to thank you for this amazing strategy and Mr. Steve of course for incorporating it into an EA, and The 7, Esquire, Danny, and all you guys who contributed to this thread. Thanks guys! Anybody catch the GBP/CHF, and AUD/CHF trades...very nice indeed PS: I like how you guys protect your profit by partial closing trades and moving stoploss to breakeven. I'm going to start doing that myself. Could this be possibly incorporated into the EA in the future? Anyway thanks again for the strategy and all the feedback!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
another one.. the overall trend of Eurgbp is up - D, W and H. But a sell order was triggered, filled and is now in some DD... As I described previously - when IBUK mentioned his buy of the day - the autotrader placed a sell on my platform! I knew it should have been a buy. Anyone else getting that...?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Nice Trading Ibuks Attached is a picture of how the robot demo traded the same pair, got 35 pips. Given that the robot did all my work, I am happy with 35 pips. If the TP was based on the candle low, the position would still be open Very nice system and very promising robot!

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Seems like the bug is only on my version of the EA. Galen, are you using the autotrader or the bounce EA? Are you using Steve's updated version from ealier today?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Yes, I always use the latest and greatest version for forward testing. You need to check the various parameters and change it to your liking before you turn it on - by default it does not trade - the safety catch is on Change DisplayOnly_NotTrading to false if you want it to trade.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Right ! I switched it to "false" - trading begann immediately !

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Viv, Is this the trade you're referring to? If so, it looks like it was taken from the Daily chart (1440 in the comments), and it looks to be consistent with the strategy. Franko

--- 帖子 #303 ---
How strange. I never changed it to false... and its working!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Yes - that's it. Sorry for being a twat guys. Still debating on the best time frame here... But one thing.. the eurusd trade from earlier on ... the trend is up for the daily but it still generated a sell... Oh well..

--- 帖子 #305 ---
thanks for the tip...fixed

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi Laimonk, I think by looking at the first two bottoms of the bounce within a trend, you will realize that all the others bottoms of the trend are in a straight line (in line with the first two until the trend is broken). This you could consider as a support for the trend. You could then extented the line in advance to consider where you will place your buy limit for the next bounce. The opposite would hold for sell. Note however that I have been following these FX patterns for a couples years now but have not found a good trading strategy that works for me. I am planning to follow this post on "Bread and Butter" and hoping that their strategy will work out. It looks positive so far based on the comments. By the way, this is my first post "ever" on any forum, so wish me luck and I will keep you posted. Newbie 2011

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I have looked at the code and cannot see anything wrong - does not mean there is not anything wrong, just that I cannot see it.

Here also, I have looked at the code and cannot see anything wrong - does not mean there is not anything wrong, just that I cannot see it.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Ibuks, looks like a great strategy and potential here. This type of system is my style of trading, which is reversal based upon entry. Also, enjoy counter or range trading. From reading the thread, I have made a few conclusions for my testing. First, if any of you follow the 10.0 Nanningbob thread on counter trend trading, Bob has defined volatility of pairs into categories. For this test, since we are looking for a reversal and our exit (loss) is based on the candle after the 24EMA break, I am looking for low volatile pairs. Secondly, if the 24EMA holds, planning on using the 2x ATR target hoping over the next few days it bounces up the EMA. Below are the specific parameters I am changing from the EA for the test: 1. Traded Pairs - USDCAD, USDJPY, NZDJPY, EURGBP, CADJPY, AUDNZD, GBPUSD, GBPCAD, AUDUSD, AUDJPY, NZDUSD This gives me a good distribution of majors, as well as I am avoiding the EUR (except for the EURGBP) and CHF pairs at this point, due to the recent volatility issues with both of those. 2. Use TP at 2x ATR, SL at 1x ATR. If the trade survives for 24 hours, SL is moved to +5 Pips/BE. I did not see a BE function in the EA, so this would be a manual process. At times, if the pair stalls prior to the target due to support/resistance, occasionally will take profit, but in most cases I plan to be patient and use the EMA for support to achieve target. 3. Test from 8/15 to 9/14, then analyze results for conclusions on the next round of testing. So, only changes I am making are the pairs traded, use of BE after 24 hours and an occasional TP prior to 2x ATR target. If you want to follow along, I have create a myfxbook account for tracking, link is below. $2,500 balance, trading .01 lots. Looks fun and interested to see the results. Hope to get 150-200 trades for analysis. http://www.myfxbook.com/members/geor...-system/149197 George

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Also, thanks to Steve for his great work! I am using his latest update in Post #110. One last criteria I am using in the testing is avoiding major news events. For example, if the GBP has retail sales (I live in the US) prior to retiring for the evening, I will pull off the GBP pairs until the next morning and the event has passed. Same with interest rate announcements, NFP, etc. It will take some management, but just a tweak to the EA each day to avoid entries during major news events.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Steve, I think I found the problem, I was looking at the USDCAD H1 pending order on the chart, the TP:SL ratio looked wrong, TP was very close to the sell limit price and SL was far away, so I manually deleted the pending order. Immediately, the new pending order appeared with the right 2TP:1SL ratio. Eureka! UpdateFillPrices() only updated the price. As both TP and SL stayed the same, changing the price also changed the TP:SL ratio for each pair. This could be the reason for the varying TP:SL ratios for the reported 11 trades yesterday. Just thinking out loud, if we are using ATR as SL, do we still need to use LookForTradeClosures()?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Exactly my point... take ownership of the strategy, find ur niche and run with it. Sharing ur niche can help u finetune it as others may give u suggestions u never noticed. However, avoid nay sayers. Take in all critics and ignore anything that try to pull u down. Welldone mate. Happy trading.

Should it read if (TakeProfit &gt; 0) take = CalculateTakeProfit(symbol, OP_SELL, price, tf); //SL if (StopLoss &gt; 0) stop = CalculateStopLoss(symbol, OP_SELL, price, tf); or if (TakeProfit &gt; 0 || UseAtrTakeProfit) take = CalculateTakeProfit(symbol, OP_SELL, price, tf); //SL if (StopLoss &gt; 0 || UseAtrStopLoss) stop = CalculateStopLoss(symbol, OP_SELL, price, tf); and should UpdateFillPrices() have a section to re-calc stop loss and take profit if (!delete) { int tf = GlobalVariableGet(GlobalVariableName(cc) ); int digits = MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(), MODE_DIGITS); double price = NormalizeDouble(GetMa(OrderSymbol(), tf, MaPeriod, MaShift, MaMethod, MaAppliedPrice, 0), digits); if (price != OrderOpenPrice() ) { double take, stop; int type = OrderType(); if (type == OP_SELL || type == OP_SELLLIMIT || type == OP_SELLSTOP) { // TP if (TakeProfit &gt; 0 || UseAtrTakeProfit) take = CalculateTakeProfit(OrderSymbol(), OP_SELL, price, tf); //SL if (StopLoss &gt; 0 || UseAtrStopLoss) stop = CalculateStopLoss(OrderSymbol(), OP_SELL, price, tf); } else { // TP if (TakeProfit &gt; 0 || UseAtrTakeProfit) take = CalculateTakeProfit(OrderSymbol(), OP_BUY, price, tf); // SL if (StopLoss &gt; 0 || UseAtrStopLoss) stop = CalculateStopLoss(OrderSymbol(), OP_BUY, price, tf); } // if (type == OP_SELL || type == OP_SELLLIMIT || type == OP_SELLSTOP) bool result = OrderModify(OrderTicket(), price, stop , take, OrderExpiration(), CLR_NONE); if (!result) OldPriceUpdateBars = 0; }//if (price != OrderOpenPrice() ) }//if (!delete) Love the technique, very simple and makes regular points. Thanks. Zak

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Zak, Any chance you could post your updated version of the EA? I'm no coder &amp; my attempts to update the code failed, as my updated version won't compile - 3 errors &amp; 2 warnings - one of which was, "What are you doing here, you don't know how to write code!" I was stunned! 8-) Franko

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi I made a quick and dirty version to test the ATR feature only, it does not take into account any other friendly features like setting different TP/SL and other time frames. I did this for testing H1 timeframe and the ATR TP/SL feature. Changes made: 1. Spread added to buy limit orders. 2. ATR TP/SL hardcoded into orders (only atr will work). 3. UpdateFillOrders will update TP/SL based on latest ATR. Bugs noted - current robot does not like updating GBPJBY TP/SL, still working on it. Please use Steve's latest version when it comes out as I will be testing that too. Cheers Good Trading guys!

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Franko I would honestly wait until Steve has a look as I do not know if the changes I have made are what he intended. If they are then I have no doubt he will add it to the version in post #1.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
suggestion?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Interesting comparison!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I think this... suggestions?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Cheers zak. Much appreciated. Guys, download zak's update if you are using ATR for stops and tp's.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
i sound really pathetic - but is it possible to update the same changes done in the autobot to the other bot so that we can use the same strategy on individual pairs? My metatrader allows me to use stocks and commoditites. Actually, do you think its possible to add an option if the bot can be an autotrader or an individual one or is there no point - it would avoid you having to to update changes to two bots in the future?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Simply have one pair in the PairsToTrade list - I am only demoing this on EU at the mo, as I found trading lots of pairs led to losers.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Below is a great example of where I decided to take profit prior to the 2x target, as explained in my testing criteria. You see we had a nice run up and well above the 24 EMA, however look at all the resistance on the 4H chart at 1.6470. Entered at 1.6271, Exited at 1.6458, with the profit target sitting at 1.6549. This would be a case of taking the 187 Pips vs. taking a chance to get the other 91. This was the 4th run at 1.6470 and looks to be holding as of now and strong resistance. So far, this is the only profit trade I have manually pulled off. Wish all good trading... George

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Ahhhhh yes! Now why didnt I think of that..... Gonna see if it works if I put in some stocks and crude oil in the 'paitstotrade' list...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I think this.. and EURCHF..

--- 帖子 #326 ---
is anyone getting many trades with Zak's version? I've had 1 eurjpy trade so far, which is open. It appears to have missed a couple of trades where I would have traded it manually - anyone else?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks Zak, I will add this to the first page once I get the chance to be at my desk. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thanks to all contributors here for another simple but powerful system - but particular comments on the dashboard which gives a great overview of the market. I'd like to highlight 2 further uses of this: 1. On the 5M timeframe it is excellent for highlighting momentum trades Philip Nell has documented one version of a 5M momentum system, I have also been using Jim Pruitt's MAX system. The table highlights good entries - you may want to reduce to 20/21 EMA. 2. Later in the day its good for retracements/pinbars on H4. Look for high distances from the 24 EMA for possible retracements. I have made a lot of pips retracing GBPCHF today

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Great observation. Thats part of the taking ownership process. welldone mate and I wish you many more pips. Kindly show some of the trades and how u use it....that will be greatly appreciated. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Here are the details of that GBPCHF trade. My chart has EMA24 in yellow, EMA50 dotted red and EMA200 dotted turquoise. My adapted version of the dashboard shows +10 to -10 trades in yellow and shorter timeframes as well. Here the dashboard identified a large H4 movement from EMA24, I confirmed that on the GBPCHF chart - the white dotted curve of my regression indicator also confirmed that the price was likely to drop (Look at I-Regr indicator for regression analysis). The 2 trades on my live micro account gave me 162 pips. You'll also notice how the trade 30261111 bounced strongly off EMA50 just before reaching my 1.3020 target and was closed manually for 63 pips less!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Ibuks, I appreciate the advice and thanks for the system idea. It is only 3 days, but +896 pips to start! The market is a bit range bound now, which helps with the low volatility pairs I am using. Hopefully, we will get some good trending in the market in Sept and we can evaluate those results. I have had a few questions and found a few errors, so thought I would update my parameters from those questions: 1. Traded Pairs - USDCAD, USDJPY, NZDJPY, EURGBP, CADJPY, AUDNZD, GBPUSD, GBPCAD, AUDUSD, AUDJPY, NZDUSD, AUDCAD (missed this one on the first post) - 12 total pairs 2. Use TP at 2x ATR, SL at 1x ATR. If the trade survives for 24 hours, SL is moved to +5 Pips/BE. I did not see a BE function in the EA, so this would be a manual process. At times, if the pair stalls prior to the target due to support/resistance, occasionally will take profit, but in most cases I plan to be patient and use the EMA for support to achieve target. - I have provided an example of when I will take profit vs. waiting for 2x ATR on post #323. 3. EA used - it is not from Post #110 as I originally stated, but from post #276, which is the last EA update from Steve. 4. Timeframes - 1H, 4H, 1D 5. Starting Account Balance - $2,500, 0.01 Lot Size 6. Test dates are from 8/15 to 9/14, then analyze results for conclusions on the next round of testing. So, I am not changing anything in the methodology until 9/15. Hope that answers a few more questions out there. Happy trading to all... George

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Yesterday I described a use of an adapted B'n B dashboard in 5M momentum trading. Here's an example around London open this morning. Here are the steps: 1. Look for a trade with 0 in 5M column - ie sitting on EMA20 2. Bring up the chart - in this case EURCHF 3. Confirm that there is high probability price will rise - look at the signals box on left, regression indicator (dotted channel) and general PA 4. Set sensible SL/TP - with positive R:R 5. 23 pips in 5 minutes Another example of making small adaptations to a very useful indicator

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi Mandj19, Welldone mate...very nice adaptation. I trade only the 1hr, 4hr and daily. I belief traders that love lower tf can look at this adaptation. Very welldone and keep the pips flowing. Happy trading

Hi guys! I was trying this EA and now at lunch I realized I was having a tsunami of alert messages of breaking points and stop losses not going through. The problem is that I am using Steve's MPTM to control curencies overall, with stop losses and break evens, etc. And with this EA they are fighting each other like mad! I can't figure out a way to switch of this EA's stop loss, is that not possible? I even put Stop Los to zero, Switched "Use ATR" off and all and nothing worked. If this is not possible, could you please add a parameter like "Use Stop Loss True/False" or something? Thank you. PS: If there is another solution, please enlighten me in the good direction, as I can't remember anything right now besides stop using MTPM, which I don't want to.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I have been asked for more details about my two charts (GBPCHF and EURCHF trades): 1. The summary indicator on top left is Signal Bars V71. Good for a general summary - it is well known and you can look it up. 2. The regression indicator: Look at www.mql4.com then codebase then indicators then find regression analysis v2 by barmenteros. Similar to I-Regr which is well documented. Creates a channel based on last N candles. 3. I use EMA20 (or 24)for position - in this method we are looking for price to be on this line then EMA50 and EMA200 for buy/sell direction. If price is on line it is distance 0 in the dashboard table. Remember indicators are always just a guide - the regression indicator in particular should not be used in isolation. Also strict money management as always.

"Dear client, Our server logs show excessive amount activity on your trading account and this is causing unreasonable load to the servers. It is most likely due to an EA sending too many requests.

Hi Bullrun, Are u running the ea on ur live account already? You get such an email only if u are running it on live account...I shld think. I have never received such email and I have it running on several demo accounts with different settings. If u are already on live account....u must be very very brave...lol. I will advice u try and trade it manually very well first b4 trusting ur live account to an ea....experience has taught me well...lol

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I agree with IBUK here. Personally, I think this strategy is amazing. However, the EA needs some attention I think - its not as profotable as it could be. Just my personal opinion. I have had some good luck on demo with this method (not the EA). I look at the Daily and 4H chart trends and then only place my orders at the EMA line in the direction of the overall trend on the 1H chart. I get less losses (probably less trades too, but thats not the poiny). This method is different to the original but we are making this our own :-)

--- 帖子 #339 ---
It's due to the fact that the ea keeps modifing the trade as the ma changes value - which is almost all the time. This can partly be solved by going into the code and change "sleep(1000)" into something like sleep(60000) (instead of 1 sec it will now be idle for 60 sec).

Hello FF traders. I have been following this thread, and went back to the beginning to try to understand. I have stopped trading the Euro/USD, a prior favorite of mine, because it has been stuck in a range for so long. I have moved onto gold, crude, and Russell, but I would like to get back to currencies. This group seems to have some impressive results with this system. Can the auto signals be generated using Ninjatrader v7.7? Is there a link where one can download the ATM and/or indicators, or is it totally manual input of the settings? Thanks in advance. Cad.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi cadrmn, I agree with u on eu, it's been in a range. However, if u carefully trade it with sup/res, u will still get ur pips and catch some nice cool pips. U can get 24ema on any trading platform, ninja, trade station etc. However, if u are talking about the ea, then...u may have to write it for ur own trading platform. The 24ema strategy aka bread and butter works on any financial instruments. It works on es, ym, ftse, dow, russel, etc and guess what, it works on stocks. It's simple, easy and no complicated stuff. I however advice that u take note of sup/res to get the best out of the strategy. But first understand the simplicity first. Don't complicate it. I wish u d very best. Happy trading.

Hi, Ibuks, This warning message is from my finfx demo. I am also surprised to get such a warning email from a demo account. In fact I got two emails warning because I am running 2 demos. I have changed sleep 1000 to 60000 and will see if this will reduce the load. I also turn off the ShowStats hopefully will help reduce the load. Well, I haven't dare to run it on live account yet but I have been thinking next week to put it on a live account with 0.01 lots with 20TP and 100SL. I haven't got any luck with 2xATR TP and 1xATR SL because SL is too frequent and Equity graph kept falling. Now I am trying to use 1xATR TP and 2xATR SL to see how it goes. I think this EA got great potential. Thanks for sharing this system with us.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Had some pennies left on an micro account, so started to trading this one live there. It trutly is amazing. I did test it on demo with the atr stuff, but that doesn't work out great. My theory is that, when trading manually, you pick the best trades so you need small sl's and big tp's. When trading all of the bounces, like the ea does, price often pushes quite a bit beyond the ma before retreating (20-50 pips). Besides you should consider using different stops/tp's for different timeframes. Now it's doing sl = 100 for all timeframes. On H1 it's perfect, almost never get's hit and a perfect saver when the markets go crazy. For D1 trades on the other hand, it's not uncommon to push far beyond those 100 pips before retracing. I think something like sl = 500, tp = 150 would be better. This is the main reason i only trade H1 (which is the best performing untill now).

Steve, i made this indicator that at the begin of the bar, will calculate where the price will hit the ma. Not sure if it's bugfree (weekend-can't test it now), but i think it does the trick. Hope you can find some time to implement this, i think it will save huge data and CPU recources for the ea. Cheers, Simon

--- 帖子 #345 ---
George, Thanks for sharing your setup &amp; results. Are you using the Optional Filters, H4 &amp; D1 Pivot? Thanks!! BTW, if anybody copies George's Trading Pairs list, make sure you remove the spaces (all spaces), otherwise the EA will just trade (and display) the first pair. Cheers! Franko

Hi, I tried using the auto trading EA on EURUSD 15min chart using 21ema bounce. I have set the take profit to 10pips, as the candle closes, the EA will update the entry price limit order according to the moving average. However i find that after the limit order has been updated, the take profit remains the same as the initial order's Take Profit price. Can an adjustment be done for the EA to move the Take Profit price as well?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Franko, I have the H4 and Daily pivots marked as "true" on the EA. I did not change those and so they were OOTB from Steve's last version. Best of trading to you.. George

Thanks for the reply Ibuks. Stay profitable !

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Good Morning Ibuks. Is there a place where I can download this indicator / strategy, or at least find the setting parameters and how to set them up? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi, after demoing the EA for 3 weeks, i can tell you the best tradeable pairs (till now) MyFxbook log: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/sgtforex/bounce/144979 You also can look for the best pairs by your own... I think the best pairs are: CAD/CHF (won 5 of 5) CAD/JPY EUR/JPY EUR/USD GBP/CHF USD/CAD cheers

Sgt, I am new to this room, but not new to trading. I have stopped trading the Euro while it has been rangebound for the past few weeks, but am interested in the currency strategy being discussed here, as it seems that traders are having success with it. Can you tell me if there is any ONE place that I can either download the strategy / indicators, or at least read a piece on how to set it up in NinjaTrader? Thanks, and stay profitable !

--- 帖子 #352 ---
hi Sgt... awesome results. are your settings for the EA out of the box?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi cadrmn, The 24ema is a standard indicator with any trading platform. EMA stands for exponential moving average. Nothing special to download. On your ninja platform, apply 24ema and u are ready to trade bread and butter. As easy as that. Hope this helps. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Sgt.Forex, Many thanks for this info. I hope someone will make use of this info and profit from it. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I'm going live with very small lots - had great results on a demo. I'm using Sgt. Forex's list for now, will grow the list as the account grows. I'm running OOTB, .02 lot size, No TP &amp; 2xATR SL, which rarely ever gets hit. For those just joining in on the fun, please keep in mind 2 traits of this EA: 1. It takes a while (at least a day or so) to take any trades (limit orders should go in very quickly, but actual trades take much longer), as this EA lays a bed of traps &amp; waits patiently for its victim. 2. With no TP, you will see an early draw down as unsuccessful trades are taken, then sluffed off. Have patience &amp; keep your lot sizes conservative. It can take days for profitable trades to fill in. Fingers Crossed!! Thanks again to all of the contributers - I will be sharing my results. Franko

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Very impressed that you have tested it and find value in it. I wish you all the best and pls keep us posted on development. I am still trading it manually, however, the ea has greatly helped me to do other pairs which I have never done before. Kudos to all contributors. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I've been monitoring it lately, and found some weird bug. Although I can't find it in the code, trades almost never close when the bar opens &amp; closes at the wrong side of the bar.. Anybody got the same error?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Thanks Ibuks. I actually have a 13, 24, and 50 ema that I use. I like to see the faster cross the slower, and I have been watching the general rule being discussed here. If I understand correctly, it seems to be a retracement back to the 24 ema to look for price pattern that supports an entry. I understand the Average True Range as well. I guess the confusing part to me is programming my strategy to generate the signals that everyone seems to be talking about. I am interested in the EA programming that needs to take place. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I've found a simple way to replicate The7's "TP on half the trade at 1xATR, let the other half run." I was running BnB on one terminal, No TP, letting the trades run, but I've seen more than a few trades retrace, giving back all of their profits. I'm now running BnB on two instances of MT4, with different magic numbers. One copy has TP=1xATR &amp; one copy has no TP. BTW, if you simply Copy a MT4 folder, then Paste it into a new location, it will run perfectly - only needs to be "Installed" once, and can be copied as many times as needed after that. I did make sure to clear out all Global Variables (Tools -&gt; Global Variables) before starting the second instance of BnB. Hope this helps. Franko

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Esquire, I haven't found any trades that fit that description yet - make sure you're looking at the correct time frame (enable comments to see the TF the trades was placed on). A trade that doesn't appear to follow the strategy on a 60 Minute chart will look completely different on a H4 or D1 chart. Franko

--- 帖子 #361 ---
....i noticed that if it's automated something like 50 percent of the trades get in profit , the others play the break, they cross the ema and go in the opposite direction . is it possible to develop a multipair basket version ?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I've started to have a play around with this idea using MPTM basket feature, i let the EA open the trades as usual but then use MPTM to manage the basket using a trailing stop of 75% once $15 is reached on a $1k demo account. So far results not been too great but to be honest i set it up and let alone whilst playing around with all the other goodies on offer at the moment from Steve. I have turned off basket feature at moment to see if it fairs better and so far it seems to be, see last couple of trades. I am using OOTB using ATR SL and TP. http://www.myfxbook.com/members/mag_...-butter/153085 Mike

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Here are some trades I took. One of the major requirement you need for this strategy and any other strategy for that matter is patience. This particular strategy teaches you to be patient, wait for price to come to you and stop chasing price. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi Can I ask please, re:Trade 3 do you use your judgment for stops? or have a fixed amount?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Instead of using a stop loss and closing a trade out early, has anyone considered using nanningbob's recovery method or something similar instead?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi, Pls read the first post again. Trade 3 was closed becos the stop loss criteria was met. The signal candle closed above 24ema, the next candle open above 24ema and closed above 24ema. It also led to Trade 4 as a limit order to buy @ 24ema was placed. Hope it is clear? Happy trading

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Sorry, I had read that rule. Would you place an emergency stop, would you use a fixed amount or swing hi/lo?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi Ibuks, Firstly, I want to say thank you for your nice strategy. My I ask you, after trade number 2 but before trade number 3, why dont you put a buy limit again, if you place buy limit again, it would be a lost trade, right ? if you have some reason why dont you place a buy limit again, can you share with us the logic behind it? Thank you

--- 帖子 #369 ---
No, I just follow the rule. Its a time based rule and u need discipline to follow it.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi, I love 1st touch best. I was not even around when that trade happened. But, I had my limits ready and trailing stop. It was a risk I was willing to take. I did not know there was going to be a news...but am glad it worked out Also as a rule, i usually wait for price to travel away from the 24ema by at least 20 pips b4 i can consider another trade. Just try to learn it and keep at it until u understand it. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #371 ---
How much do you typically trail by? Is it fixed or do you vary based on pair/volatility? I like this method, manually, though currently not managed to make much with the system i have been bouncing around initial deposit using the EA multipair. I have just changes my setting again so we shall see. I have MPTM applying trailing stops and BE as of today to give it a try. Thanks to you, Steve and Squalou for all the tools and method. Mike http://www.myfxbook.com/members/mag_...-butter/153085

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Ibuks, Sorry to ask you more question =) .. hopefully you dont get angry at me in the picture, the candle that has been marked as trade 2 is where trade 2 buy limit order has been triggered right? and the candle after that is the take profit candle. but the price on that candle also has travelled more than 20 pips ( around 30 pips ) from ema. but I still confused why you dont consider putting buy limit order on that candle? or you dont like to place buy limit order on the same candle as the take profit candle ? is 1st touch means if price let say crossed ema 24 from bellow ema and closed above ema 24, and then if next candle touch ema24, you would categorise it as 1st touch right ? ( with the assumption that price already travelled more than 20 pips ) thanks a lot for your help

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I said I was not around when the trade happens. If i was around, I will definately not trade a news candle.... Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I usually trail when am not on around to trail manually. Becos i trade eu maily, I just trail by 15-21 pips. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Cool, thanks and good luck

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Ibuks - So if I have this right, could you please let me know. Let's call this trade "bullish" for the purpose of this example. Price is rising. It moves at least 24 pips ABOVE my 24 ema, then retraces (possibly forming a swing high before retracing) to touch the 24 ema. I can now START to look for an entry. Is it safe to assume that my ema's should be sloped up? Now price starts to move back up. Is the entry once price candle crosses the newly formed swing high? Is the entry some other technical level? If so, please define. What timeframe works best? If anyone else can address this, that is fine as well. Seems like a fantastic strategy for the swing trader. Thanks so much !

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Cadrmn, If u have noticed, I have tried to avoid using complicated technical terms in order to avoid confusing anyone. Try and see this strategy as simple as it is. Swing high, swing low, ema pointing up or pointing down etc will further complicate the system for u. Take time to read post 1 again. 1. What is the value of the 24ema 2. Is price above or below the 24ema? Start with this simple stuff before u try to complicate it. I understand that the human mind is a very complicated stuff, but why not decoupled urself for once, look at it as simple as it is and try to make sense of it. If u can do this, u will begin to see the relevancy of simplicity and once u truly understand it, u can start to add other stuff u love to it. As u learn to make things simple, u will realize that this strategy will eventually help u to: 1. Understand PA (Price Action) 2. Wait for price to come to you instead of chasing after it 3. Teach u patient Remember that the strategy is bread and butter which in the real sense is actually bounce or break. Play the bounce while it is there and if it breaks, then enjoy the break. It is however going to be simple to see and understand if u see it that way. This is just a very quick response and I hope it helps. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Ibuks, Thanks for the response. That works for me !

Thanks Ibuks,

Below is an example of a trade I missed some few minutes ago. Earlier today, I set the limit at 24ema and was away from my desk. By the time I came back, price came close to the 24ema, which have also now moved up above my initial limit buy. Price hit 24ema and bounce back with more than 30- 40 pips available for grab and even more if this current move still go on. This is where the ea comes into place. The ea on the demo however took the same trade and closed in profit for 20 pips. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I was blessed to be around just some few minutes ago to catch this eu trade. After missing the previous 24ema trade, I adjusted my limit buy to reflect the latest 24ema position and I kept chking every hr. Just got back and noticed that I was filled and first tp already hit. Nice and easy...no need for complicated analysis. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Take a look at this trade taken today. I came online late to trade and saw eu falling hard. I waited for the candle to finish and set my limit to sell. The rest is history now. Is this a chance trade, was I lucky to be at my desk at this time? Or is it just beginner's luck?? I guess the pips reward will tell. The picture say it all. If I was online earlier, the picture may have been different. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Ibuks, thanks your effort and sharing about this strategy, what is your opinion , the strategy through stev EA that why cannot get profitable performance , what is the major issue compare to your manual trading? Regard.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Devonfgu, Use the machine advantage. Put the ea on a demo and use it to get u started to study the strategy. With the ea on a demo, I have been trying 2 other pairs which will be come part of what i trade when am happy. However, I could not focus on more than 1 pair b4, but the ea is gradually letting me loose. I also post some of these trades to help other fully understand the strategy. I also think the problem of mt4 also contributed to the failure of the ea so far. But as far as I am concern, the ea is a winner as it is helping me see what I would ordinarily not see if i was trading manually. My advice, trade it manually first and then use the ea to ur advantage as best as u can. I also remember Steve saying somewhere on his thread that there is no set and forget ea....am I right Steve??....lol. Maybe this is a case in time. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
hello all these are my last 10 days.. I'm working as I had written a few weeks ago with rules of Ibuks in first post and the fibo The7 Work 2-3 hours a day or less.. only manual, very very simple at least 35 pips a day(today 130.. last week I was on vacation) I will keep you also updated the next few weeks, ask if you need The advice to you is do not try to complicate it by believing that it can not be so much simpler..

Hi Ibuks, I am a little bit confused here.In the first page it says: 2. When price is below 24ema and travelling UP towards 24ema, If price close above 24ema, Then open and close above 24ema , set a buy limit at 24ema anticipating a retest of 24ema for the journey UP. Vice visa for sell. But here you didn't wait for 1 candle to open and close below 24ma. Would explain it why? Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi Mike, I hope u read my statement ' If I was online earlier, the picture may have been different'. That explains it all. If I was online earlier, the scenerio would have been different as I would have been in the earlier bounce trade which will be a loss and then reversing the trade may have giving the necessary pips. I came online when the candle was breaking down and that is the point at which my trading started for the day. In effect, price was below 24ema and i waited at the 24ema to catch the bus to the south. This is the reason individually, we need to master and tweak it to suit ur personalities. Trading the same thing for over 3 years have taught me some lessons I could probably not be able to explain it all...but am sure u can get ur niche as well trading it just like The7. I got an email of someone that only trade this strategy between Frankfurt and NY sessions only becos he think that is d best time for him to get good trades and he trades more than 1 pair. I hope this help? Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks for explanation.I know exactly what are you talking about Ibuks. These are the stuff which needs time and practice to master it like you. Well done buddy. Mike

Hi Ibuks, Super system. Simple to boot! I'll start testing post 11 sept. I notice that tp is 10+ pips.

From my post #331, decided to take off trades prior to NFP tomorrow, as avoiding major news events like NFP would really be one to avoid. To date, prior to this NFP event, I have only taken 2 trades off the table for profits, so most of the results are completely automated. A bit of a bumpy ride, but since Aug 15, sitting at +1,771 Pips. Mid next week, I am planning to start looking at the data to begin building framework of the criteria for a complete analysis on Sept 15. Should be interesting to break it down and come to some conclusions for the next test. Good trading to all... George

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I did not get any trade on eu last wk Thursday and I had adjusted my sell limits several times waiting for price to come to me. Friday, being NFP, I left my Thursday limit sell and did not amend it again expecting news to get eu to rally up to my sell limit. True to expectation, news came out, pushed price to my sell limit and BAAAAM.... got my wish. Still riding the bus now. I wish u a happy trading week.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi, Sorry for the late response. Try and check the ea properties again. Make sure stop trading is not set to false. I will however advice that you learn to trade it properly first manually so that you will be able to undestand the logic behind the strategy. Happy trading.

Hi, Today is a great example of waiting for price to come to you. EU price fell all through asian session...and guess what held it??... 24ema. Price hit the 24ema while I was sleeping, and until I woke up, it was still holding it. Patience was handsomely rewarded later. Wait for price....dont chase price. Hope u caught some of it....?? Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi, Pls see the pic below that highlights a couple of trades. Trade 1: This was a buy limit expecting a bounce from the 24ema. it was a loss. Trade 2: At the failure of trade 1, a sell limit was set at 24ema. This was a nice winner. Trade 3: A sell limit at the 24ema, also a winner Trade 4: This was a sell limit, a loss. Trade 5: This was a reverse trade of trade 4. At the failure of trade 4, a buy limit was set at the 24ema. It was a winner. Trade 6: Another buy limit which turned out to be a winner. Trade 7: This is particularly interesting. Becos of fomc, i avoided trading and waited for the news candle on the hrly to close. A sell limit was set at the 24 ema, price retraced to pick the trade up and a huge winner it turned out to be. total of 7 trades, 2 loss and 5 wins. If you look at the trades very well, the losses are minimal compared to the winners. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Nicely done! I like the simplicity.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi Ibuks. I've been following this thread with interest. Have you tried dropping a 200 EMA onto your chart? It takes just as much patience to wait for the right setup, but when the 24 crosses the 200, it is usually a good entry, especially if it coincides with the setup discussed in this thread. I look for this on my faster timeframes, mainly 21 and 13 Range charts. I'll try to post some charts when I get to trading Monday morning. Happy Trading !

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Cadmn, It will be great to see your chart.... Are u talking about range chart?? Ibuks

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Yes Ibuks, I generally use range charts. Pretty tough to have the patience to wait for the pattern to develop on the longer timeframes, as I do not hold overnight positions. But VERY effective on the 21 and 13 range charts. I'll upload some charts this week.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Yea...it will be great to know how u get ur range chart...will love to test. I have also have good success on renko charts as well...but will love to try out range charts as well. Do u have ur range chart on mt4 or some other platform? The range chart I get on mt4 is not that reliable. Pls share if u have any good one. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I use Ninja Trader, but should be able to get a range chart on any platform. When you set up your timeframe, from the drop down menu, just choose "range", same as you would choose other timeframes like, "daily", "hour", "minute" etc. Here is a 21 Range chart. The solid line is the 24 EMA and the large dotted line is the 200 EMA. You can obviously see the two crosses, and the move after the cross. Right now, which is the farthest right portion of the chart, it looks like we may get a bullish cross on this chart. Faster timeframes already crossed.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Then again? This is where patience paid off. 21 Range cross never happened.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
ibuk when you say the price has to rebound back to the 24ema, does it have to touch the 24 ema or cross over it ? if not, how close does it have to be before we can take it as the the price is in line with 24ema ? in a buy example say the price is above 24 ema. it then retraces to the 24 ema. after the close of the candle that retraces to 24 ema, we enter a buy on the open of next candle, right ? now, it can also be the case that when we enter a buy this candle can keep on going down the 24ema instead of rising. in such a case we wait for that candle to close. and then we close our buy position and on the opening of the next candle we enter a sell ? is the above correct ? ta

If someone knows another dashboard please send the link here. Thank you

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Anyone still using this method? I have seen a lot of folks present results from back tests they have done but if you trade this as I do, those back tests can be deceiving. That's because an hourly candle can look like it hit the 24 EMA and then kept going and so to0 did the next candle without reversing What you won't see in that back test is that often that candle actually retraced 10+ pips. If you want more accurate back test results then use the attached indicator and on a 5M or even 1M chart to see what really happens within that hourly candle. And get a more accurate idea of whether or not your target is reached. If you look at the chart attached you will see the M-Candles indicator. Note that i use this on 5M chart with a 288 EMA which is a 24 EMA on the 1H chart

hello sir can you share this indicator thank you

Good Day ! I am a newcomer to this excellent forum and wish to become a long term member of this community. I also saw this topic where trading is really simplified, and really appeals to me. However I noted that none of the EAs are working on my terminal. Could anybody help by posting a working version? Thanks in advance. Cheers.
