Hello Traders: I am a long time lurker at Forex Factory and I would like to open a thread to discuss a Profitable Trading Strategy that I have been using for more than 1 year. I have been hesitant to Post in the past regarding this Trading Method as it employs a “Semi-Martingale” position sizing and most of the Threads that I have read on “Martingale” methods here at Forex Factory advise against this concept. The basic premise of the Strategy is not entirely new, nor do I claim that it is 100% original, however, I have “made it my own” and found a way to trade it profitably. Having said that, I am willing to share the Strategy, but I would first like to determine the level of interest that Factory Members would have concerning such a method. If interest is strong, I am willing to invest the time necessary to explain the method in detail. I will share the basic concepts of the Strategy below and await feedback from Members. INTRODUCTION: The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy Having actively traded the FOREX Market for more than 5 years, I have learned that PREDICTING what the Market will do, particularly in the short-term, is virtually impossible. We can certainly have an idea of what MIGHT occur, however, we can never be sure. Probability is the key along with a system that helps to exploit this probability. The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy does not rely on our being consistently correct on the Market's direction, but enables us to profit both when we are RIGHT and also when we are WRONG. The Strategy relies on volatility, not on making correct predictions. This is essentially a Day Trading Strategy with trades generally lasting less than a day or two at most. The Strategy can be traded manually on virtually any Broker's Platform, however, you would need to be at the Trade Terminal constantly to manage and monitor your position, therefore, I highly recommend using a MetaTrader 4 Broker along with my "FXTradepro Manager" Expert Advisor (EA), which I have had programed for me by a professional Coder. Unlike many EA's, the FXTradepro Manager does not trade as a fully automated system. What it does is trade the System or more precisely, MANAGE and monitor our position once we have decided on a solid entry. Essentially, we tell the EA when to enter the market and once that is done the EA will do the rest until the conclusion of the trade. The Concept: The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy is a probability (expectancy) based System using what I call a "Sequence Of Trades" that runs until a Profit Target is ultimately reached. Below I will break down this idea into the pertinent details: 1) We open a trade (set the EA) based upon our Entry criteria. For example, we open a BUY on EURUSD at 1.3500. Our Stop Loss is set to 10 Pips at 1.3490 and our Take Profit is set to 40 Pips at 1.3540. This is called our INITIAL ENTRY in the Sequence. 2) If our Take Profit is hit we then wait for a new Entry Signal and begin again. 3) If our Stop Loss is hit, then our next trade would be a SELL (assuming our first trade was a Buy as above) which we would enter at Market Price as soon as our Stop Loss is triggered. This new Sell position would have the same Take Profit = 40 and Stop Loss = 10 settings as the Initial Entry. This Sequence Of Trades continues each time our Stop Loss is hit, with the resulting trade going in the opposite direction of the previous trade. The Sequence Of Trades is complete whenever a Take Profit is reached. When using the FXTradepro Manager Expert Advisor, the EA will automatically open and close all trades once we set it for the Initial Entry. http://aycu35.webshots.com/image/249...1327585_rs.jpg 4). In the above example our Initial Entry was a Buy. Alternately, if our Initial Entry had been a Sell, then the next trade in the Sequence Of Trades would be a Buy, with a 10 pip Stop Loss, and a Take Profit of 40. To summarize the above: A Sequence Of Trades means that each time our Stop Loss is hit, the next trade would be: In the opposite direction The Stop Loss and Take Profit settings would remain the same as our Initial Entry at TP=40 and SL=10 for all trades in the Sequence Lot sizes increase as follows: http://aycu31.webshots.com/image/245...5862261_rs.jpg In Summary, the Sequence Of Trades continues, Buying or Selling, while increasing Lot sizes on each position until the Take Profit is ultimately hit. We never have more than 1 position open at a time during a Sequence Of Trades (unless we are trading more than 1 pair at a time). In my experience trading the Strategy over a period of more than a year and using highly selective entries, the vast majority of my trades close by the 12th entry or sooner, leaving plenty of room for unexpected market events. The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy - Trade Example: Below is a Chart that shows how the Strategy works on a EURUSD Trade. The Take Profit and Stop Loss Settings were the Default Settings of TP=40 &amp; SL=10. The "Sequence Of Trades" was set at 24 Entries using the following Lot Size progression: 0.1 - 0.1 - 0.2 - 0.3 - 0.4 - 0.6 - 0.8 - 1.1 - 1.5 - 2.0 - 2.7 - 3.6 - 4.7 - 6.2 - 8.0 - 10.2 - 13.0 - 16.5 - 20.8 - 26.3 - 33.1 - 41.6 - 52.2 - 65.5. http://aycu35.webshots.com/image/249...4349205_rs.jpg This Trade hit the Profit Target on the 5th Entry in the Sequence with a 0.4 Lot position size. The first 4 trades in the Sequence, with 0.1, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 Lot position sizes respectively, were stopped out with a 10 Pip Stop Loss on each trade. Here is how the Trade worked out PROFITABLY starting the Sequence Of Trades with 0.1 Standard Lot which equals 10,000 Units (1 Mini Lot): #1 - Initial Entry - SELL 0.1 Lot: SL hit -10 Pips @ $1. per Pip = -$10. #2 - 2nd Entry - BUY 0.1 Lot: SL hit - 10 Pips @ $1. per Pip = -$10. #3 - 3rd Entry - SELL 0.2 Lots: SL hit - 10 Pips @ $2. per Pip = -$20. #4 - 4th Entry - BUY 0.3 Lot: SL hit - 10 Pips @ $3. per Pip = -$30. #5 - 5th Entry - SELL 0.4 Lots: TP hit +40 Pips @ $4. per Pip = +$160. TOTAL = $160 - $70 in aggregate losses = $90 PROFIT for the Sequence Currency Pairs to Trade: The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy can be traded on virtually any Currency pair. Since my Stops are tight on each trade (10 pips), I generally prefer to trade Pairs with a pip spread of 5 or less. For pairs with a bigger spread, TP and SL settings, as well as the Sequence of Lot Sizing, need to be modified to accommodate the larger spread. Expert Advisor &amp; Indicators: I will post the .ex4 version of my Expert Advisor if there is a suitable amount of interest in the concepts that I have outlined above. There are also several Indicators that I keep on my Charts, however, I focus mainly on Price Action, Support and Resistance and Average Daily Range to decide when to enter the Market and begin a Sequence Of Trades. The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy will not make anyone a millionaire overnight or provide the ridiculously high annual returns that many Traders are hoping for, however, I have been able to make consistent gains using a method that I AM COMFORTABLE with. Please Post your comments and let me know if anyone is interested in learning more about this method. If interest is strong, I will invest the time to continue in more detail and consider the possibility of starting a Journal detailing my Entries and Results Thanks, Dan

You have made an excellent presentation. I would not trade your system, but I'm certain there will be a lot of interest on this forum. Good luck with it.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Nice presentation.. Why would anyone need an EA for this? Couldn't a person just toss a coin? Heads buy, tails sell? I am not being flippant, I am just concerned about any Marty type system including the D'Lambre and others... Perhaps you could post some actual trading results...

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Billbss and Scott: Thanks for your brief comments. Scott: This is a Stop and Reverse System and sometimes it can be difficult to enter orders and trades quickly especially during volatile Market periods. The EA that I had created for the Strategy handles all trade entries once I have told it when to enter the Initial Entry in my Sequence Of Trades. As far as Random Entry goes, It can be traded that way, however, I have found it too risky. I have had the most consistent results using a DISCRETIONARY entry for the Initial trade in my Sequence. The idea here is to enter at a place or time when we are less likely to get caught in a tight range. I hope this makes things a bit clearer. Dan

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi Please continue with the method and we will try it and the EA on a demo account as usual; during which time zone do you normally start the initial entry?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
FXTradepro I believe there are lots of traders worldwide making money in the fx market by applying similar methods. Keep on posting on this subject. Nothing wrong with what you are presenting here.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yes I like the sound of this, can you please post more regarding entries and profit/loss ratio? What time frames are best for this system?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks for the answer.. Yes, lets have a look. It would be an interesting discussion... Thanks again,

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello Howard............And Thank You for your encouragement. If interest in this Strategy continues to mount, I will post the EA and additional information on how I trade this. To answer your question, I do NOT generally set the EA to trade at a specific time, although it does have an input for a Timed Entry, which I do use sometimes. I typically review 7 currency pairs and determine when to start the Sequence based upon my analysis of the current price action. I have had very good success entering the Initial Entry as follows; SELL at Resistance or BUY at support on a 30 minute chart. I like to see a period of consolidation also prior to entering the Sequence. I will post more on this as this thread develops. I hope this information helps. Dan { Link Removed }

Sorry Scott........I didn't realize that I violated any rules. Won't happen again. Dan

Hello Random and Guess: Thank you both for posting. A complete explanation of the Strategy with charts and graphs, etc., is quite a large undertaking. I am hopeful that there will be enough interest from Factory Members over the next day or two to warrant the expenditure of time required on my part to detail the Strategy properly. I am working on some information right now to include. Please feel free to PM me if I can assist you in any way. Everyone......Please continue to Post your initial thoughts on what I have outlined in the first Post. I am working on the information to fully explain the Strategy and I want to make sure that anyone interested understands what I have presented so far. Dan

Hi there Dan Thanks for sharing You have made a very clear explanation. Ths looks like a new version of the bless_5th system. I´ve been working around bless last few days and started to make it profitable using a variation from Cuda. It will be interesting to make this variation and see where it goes. I personaly would use Hectors EMAs or rainbow to get into trades, so EA will run on autopilot. I hope i will build it this weekend. I´m working of six different projects at moment so, i can´t promiss anything. It would be easier if you posted your EA code. Anyway, martingales and d´alambert are not the most popular methods for real trading. One would have to stop somewhere on the growth process and when it happens.. the house, the car and the wife goes with it. Cheers Carllos

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Carllos.....Thanks for dropping in. I agree that Martingale money management can be a problem, but I have lessened my exposure by using a highly modified version of that idea. Personally, I am not fond of fully automated entry systems and I have been able to make this concept work mainly because I am pretty selective about my Initial Entry. The vast majority of my trades close by the 12th entry in a Sequence Of Trades (usually even sooner than that) and I have designed my Money Management to enable as many as 24 entries, so I feel very comfortable most of the time. The nice thing about the Strategy I trade is that I can adapt to Market conditions especially as that pertains to an Entry criteria. This is something that an automated entry system cannot do as well as an experienced Trader. This is just my personal opinion from my own experience and I wish you luck with your ideas and trading. Regards, Dan

Isn't it just a SAR integrated breakout system off a discretionary "offset"? I don't understand the reason for the martinggale-ish scaling up. Just seems unecessary escalation of risk to me. I know it's to try and overcome all prior failed trades at once, but exposure towards full blowout simply rises exponentially as well. IMHO the r/r edge (1:4 at 50% chance for direction to simplify)should manage the profit, not exponentially larger risk taking. Not that this sort of system appeals to me at all, just tossing some initial thoughts out there.

Ahh.. I was waiting for someone to post this strategy as I have been trading it for a few months... the problem with this system is that anyone using an ea with mt4 as I have been doing will get screwed by the broker. The broker will widen their spread even when volatility is normal to spreads as high as 32 pips (this week with ibfx with gbpusd) and even if this is done for a few seconds, it will open and close several multilot trades within a single tick and you are out several hundred and even thousand pips... believe me, it works wonderful on demos when spreads stay low but everyday, all mt4 brokers will widen spreads on live accounts to insane amounts to screw people using these types of systems....Stop and think, if your sl is like 10-20 pips and the spread wides to 20, every tick your ea is opening a multilot trade and it is being closed by sl.. within seconds, you are down A LOT!!! Luckily, i was only down 500 or so pips since I had a safeguard for spreads in my ea... be very careful trading this live with an ea!!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
igotswansons, Keep in mind that the past two weeks have not been your usual market behavior and therefore all FX brokers were widening the spreads. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #17 ---
SeekingLight.....The Strategy is essentially a BreakOut System; the concept being that we can win whichever way the Market goes on the BO. In essence I do overcome "all prior failed trades" and yes, my exposure does increase at each subsequent entry. The risk however, in my mind, comes down to PROBABILITIES. Will my Sequence Of Trades hit a Target that is 40 Pips in my chosen direction OR 50 Pips in the other direction BEFORE it ranges back and forth hitting my 10 Pip stop more than 10, 15 or even 20 times. I have been able to mitigate that from happening with 100% accuracy by being selective about entries. I certainly understand your point but for me the system has proven effective. Dan

--- 帖子 #18 ---
igotswansons....I do trade this system LIVE and yes, spread widening can be a concern. This week in particular was unusually volatile in that regard and at the end of the day, the system actually profited MORE. I had a couple of trades on GBPUSD that would normally have closed on the 3rd or 4th entry and because of spread widening issues these trades closed at 8 Entries and at 12 Entries, still far from the 24 Entry Level that causes the system to blow up. What I have done is figured the lot size increases so that the Profit at each level is a bit more than the previous level. The trade that closed at the 8th Entry profited by $190. and the 12th Entry trade closed up $460. This is on a Standard account starting the Sequence as outlined in the first Post. Do not misunderstand me, I agree that spread widening can be an issue, however, a few erroneous spikes by the typical MT4 Broker will not generally kill my system in the manner that I trade it. All good comments so far, I appreciate everyones input. Thanks, Dan

FXTRadepro: You have started this post in an interesting manner. I am interested to observe this thread. So, I think, we have generated enough responses to make you show the next card..just kidding..We are waiting.... Thanks, FX_California

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hey FX_California, I am working on getting things outlined in a clear manner. It's interesting, in that things that are so clear to me as someone who is intimate with the Strategy, are sometimes difficult to explain in a written form, especially since we have Traders on the Forum with varying levels of experience. So far it looks like we have about 4 or 5 people that are actually interested in this Method. I hope that there are more out there so that my time spent in preparing the information is well worth the effort. Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I like this type of trading and have studied this and "grid" trading much in the past. My theory is the same: very difficult to "predict" markets, so you should trade in a "reactionary" approach. Have you looked at averaging down before actually placing a reverse trade? I am very interested in averaging down because this too takes advantage of the volatility. It also has the advantage of keeping the original trade open and having that trade work for you without starting over on the spread. Its just a thought and I may be out in left field, but what about averaging down a few trades before actually placing the reverse trade? Especially if your original trade is with a heavily trending market. If you look at the EUR the last 6 years, the heavy traders were all buying on dips and making a lot of money doing it. Not a lot of brain surgery. The key of course is trading small to outlast runs against you. Just some thoughts, but I like this style of trading.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
athalon7, Thank you for your thoughts. Averaging down (or dollar cost averaging as it is also known) is a technique that I have used in the past although NOT in relation to the FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy that I am discussing in this Thread. While that idea can be useful, I would prefer to keep the discussion (at least at this point in the Thread), focused on the actual Strategy that I am Trading. By the way, my Method does very well in Trending Markets, it is the VERY TIGHT Ranges that we try to avoid. Regards, Dan

Please review POST #1 before proceeding. It is important that you understand the Basics of the Strategy as illustrated in Post #1. OK, Folks......Here comes some of the tricky stuff.....I hope that I've presented things clearly! LEVERAGE and MARGIN - The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy: An understanding of Leverage and Margin is essential when trading the FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy . Since an integral feature of the Strategy is the increasing of Lot Sizes (semi-martingale), calculations are required to make certain that enough Margin is available in your Trading Account to complete an entire Sequence Of Trades . It is important to understand that although we are Trading only 1 position at a time using the Strategy, we need to view the entire Sequence Of Trades as a single position for Margin purposes . Although we will not often need to cover an entire Sequence of up to 24 trades, we must be prepared for that possibility in order to avoid a Margin Call. The size of a Trading Account needed to trade the Strategy is dependent upon several issues: The Broker's Leverage and Margin Policy - Every Broker has different rules and Leverage options which are selected by the Individual Trader. The most common are 100:1, 200:1 and sometimes even 400:1. For our purposes in trading the FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy it is best to take advantage of the HIGHEST available Leverage offered by the Broker even though we will not often need to use it. The HIGHER the available Leverage then the SMALLER your Account Balance will need to be. Type of Account - Mini Accounts, Standard Accounts and Universal Accounts (Mini &amp; Standard Lot sizes in the same Account). - Most Mini Accounts are available at up to 200:1 and sometimes 400:1 Leverage, and most Standard Accounts are offered at 100:1 Leverage. Some Broker's do offer Standard or Universal Accounts at 200:1 Leverage and it is possible to find situations where 400:1 is obtainable. Does the Broker permit odd Lot Sizes? - For example, can you trade Mini Lots in a Standard Account or Micro Lots in a Mini Account? For our purposes this flexible feature is VERY IMPORTANT. Target and Stop Loss Settings - The larger the SL setting used, then the larger the TP must be. This is basic to the Strategy. Subsequently, the larger the settings, then the larger your Account will need to be. I recommend using the default settings in the FXTradepro Manager Expert Advisor which is set with a SL of 10 pips and a TP of 40 pips unless you are Trading a Currency Pair with a Pip Spread of greater than 5. Sequence Of Trades - The number of entries that we set the FXTradepro Manager EA to trade before taking a loss on the entire Sequence is a major consideration in regard to Leverage and Margin issues. Using a 24 Entry Sequence is theoretically safer than using a 10 or 12 Entry Sequence as the likelihood of reaching our target is certainly greater, however, the more entries that we require in our Sequence then the larger an Account must be. Lot Sizes used in the Sequence - The Lot Size of the Initial Entry in a Sequence along with TP and SL settings, the number of entries in the Sequence and our Profit goals will determine Lot Sizes throughout the entire Sequence Of Trades. The larger the Initial Entry and thus the Profit goal, then the larger an Account must be. I recommend using the default settings in the EA starting the Sequence with 0.1 Standard Lots (which is equivalent to 1 Mini Lot of 10,000 Units) for a Standard or Universal Account or .01 Lots (which is equivalent to 1 MICRO Lot of 1,000 Units) for a Mini Account. While this may seem a bit complicated and confusing to you at this point, I will spell everything out so that you will have a clear understanding of these concepts. I will break this information down by the type of MT4 Accounts that are recommended to trade the Strategy and illustrate, through the use of the FXTradepro Manager Calculator , issues such as Account Size, SL and TP Settings, as well as settings for the number of entries in a Sequence Of Trades. The examples provided are with the settings I trade with and I suggest that you use the information in the TABLES below to aid you when setting up your FXTradepro Manager EA . Understanding the FXTradepro Manager Calculator: TABLE 1.0 below is a screenshot of the Calculator that I developed to determine the various settings for use in trading the FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy using the FXTradepro Manager EA , which I will provide in a future Posting. http://aycu26.webshots.com/image/220...1134763_rs.jpg TABLE 1.0 - FXTradepro Manager Calculator - STANDARD or UNIVERSAL Account with Mini Lots Permitted - 200:1 Leverage TABLE 1.0 above details calculations for a Standard or Universal Account with 200:1 Leverage with a Broker that permits Mini Lots. These calculations provide us with the settings for the External Parameters in the FXTradepro Manager EA , as well as calculations of Profits and Losses in a Sequence Of Trades, minimum Account size and other Margin and Leverage considerations. Below I will illustrate the important details and how you apply them to your Trading. Required Margin Field: http://aycu18.webshots.com/image/242...5828397_rs.jpg Required Margin is determined by the Leverage and Margin requirements of your Broker. On a Standard or Universal Account, if you have 100:1 Leverage then you would need $1000. in your Account to open each 1.0 Lot position of 100,000 Units. 200:1 would require $500. per position and 400:1 would require $250. The example in TABLE 1.0 is for 200:1 Leverage, thus the figure indicated in the Required Margin Field is $500. You will find a reference of typical MT4 Broker Margin Requirements listed in the Account Size Information field (see below). http://aycu06.webshots.com/image/242...4561063_rs.jpg TP and SL Settings: http://aycu35.webshots.com/image/243...6290780_rs.jpg StopLoss = 10 Pips Take Profit = 40 Pips We set these Values in the Expert Advisor. Note that these are the default settings in the EA and the settings I use. http://aycu28.webshots.com/image/245...2467293_rs.jpg NOTE: These TP and SL settings are for Trades on Currency Pairs with a Pip Spread of 5 or LESS. If you wish to trade Pairs with a LARGER Pip Spread, please Contact me and I can calculate the settings that you will need. CONTINUED IN THE NEXT POST..........................

Sequence Of Trades = 24 Entries with Lot Sizing as follows: http://aycu36.webshots.com/image/244...4968378_rs.jpg We set these Values in the Expert Advisor. Note that these are the default settings in the EA and the settings I use. http://aycu07.webshots.com/image/230...8105582_rs.jpg Using the FXTradepro Manager Calculator to determine Profits, DrawDown, Losses and Account Size: Using the example of a Standard or Universal Account with 200:1 Leverage with a Broker that permits Mini Lots, I will illustrate some important considerations in TABLE 1.1 below. http://aycu08.webshots.com/image/239...4895033_rs.jpg TABLE 1.1 - STANDARD or UNIVERSAL Account with Mini Lots Permitted - 200:1 Leverage In reviewing the calculations in TABLE 1.1 we can determine the following: Profit Column - Illustrates how much Profit will be realized at each Entry in a Sequence. For example - If our TP is hit at the 15th Entry in a Sequence (#1) the Profit = $770. over and above the AGGREGATE losses on the first 14 trades in the Sequence. DrawDown Column - Illustrates the AGGREGATE Losses at each Entry in a Sequence. For example - If our SL is hit 14 times and then our TP is hit on the 15th Entry (#1), our aggregate losses at the 14th Entry would be -$2,430. When our TP is then hit on the 15th Entry the Profit would over take our aggregate losses by $770. NOTE: The above Profit and DrawDown figures are for USD Denominated Pairs such as EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD. In a Standard Account note that 1.0 Lots = 100,000 Units of Currency = $10. per Pip in Value on these USD Denominated Pairs, however, Pairs such as USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD have a LOWER Dollar Value per Pip. Account Size Information - With an Account Balance of $7,230. (#1) enough Margin is available to trade a 15 Entry Sequence Of Trades. With an Account Balance of $12,050. (#3) enough Margin is available to trade a 17 Entry Sequence Of Trades. As you can see from TABLE 1.1 with a larger Account Balance more Margin is available for a greater number of entries in a Sequence Of Trades. Generally speaking, the more "room" we have in order to trade with a higher number of entries in a Sequence then the less chance there is that the entire Sequence will close at a loss. Typically, my trades close before the 12th Entry, however, there have been rare situations particularly during quieter Market periods where a Sequence has gone to more than 12 Entries. For this reason I prefer to have the ability to sustain a Sequence as far as my Account Balance will take me and therefore Trade with a fairly large Account. To illustrate this point further, if you have an Account Balance of $31,770. (#5) you would be able to sustain a Sequence Of Trades to the 21st Entry. I have yet to see a Trade close at a loss at the 21st Entry, but the possibility does exist. Understand that your overall risk is directly related to the size of your Account and the number of entries that you Trade in a Sequence. Now that you know how to read and interprete the FXTradepro Manager Calculator , I will provide additional calculations for Standard and Universal Accounts with Margin availability at 100:1 and 400:1 in TABLES 1.2 and 1.3 that follow. In TABLES 1.4 and 1.5 in the next Post, I will provide calculations for Mini Accounts. STANDARD Account with Mini Lots Permitted - also known as a UNIVERSAL Account: (see TABLES 1.0 and 1.1 above and TABLES 1.2 and 1.3 below) A Broker's Platform that permits trading in the following Lot Size increments: 1.0 Lots = 100,000 Units = $10. per Pip 0.1 Lots = 10,000 Units = $1. per Pip http://aycu21.webshots.com/image/226...7606328_rs.jpg TABLE 1.2 - STANDARD or UNIVERSAL Account with Mini Lots Permitted - 100:1 Leverage http://aycu09.webshots.com/image/245...5863343_rs.jpg TABLE 1.3 - STANDARD or UNIVERSAL Account with Mini Lots Permitted - 400:1 Leverage CONTINUED IN THE NEXT POST.................................

MINI Account with Micro Lots Permitted: (see TABLES 1.4 and 1.5 below) A Broker's Platform that permits trading in the following Lot Size increments: 0.1 Lots = 10,000 Units = $1. per Pip .01 Lots = 1,000 Units = $0.10 per Pip 1.0 Lots = 100,000 Units = $10. per Pip http://aycu11.webshots.com/image/240...5553562_rs.jpg TABLE 1.4 - MINI Account with Micro Lots Permitted - 200:1 Leverage http://aycu04.webshots.com/image/218...9080170_rs.jpg TABLE 1.5 - MINI Account with Micro Lots Permitted - 400:1 Leverage A Final Thought - When trading the FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy it is favorable for us to trade with a Broker that offers High Leverage along with flexibility in permitted Lot Sizing. Broker's that offer Universal Accounts or Standard Accounts with Mini Lot capabilities and those offering Mini Accounts with Micro Lot capabilities are our Broker's of choice. Please post your questions or contact me if you require clarification of anything in this Post. Dan EDIT: FYI - I Trade the Strategy LIVE at a popular MT4 Broker on a Standard Account with 400:1 Leverage. I was able to obtain this level of Leverage simply by requesting it from the Broker and stating that I understood the risks involved.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thanks Dan Really very good presentation. From all the tables I understand that a safe account size to launch a 0.1 lot initial entry would be around $100,000 in order to withstand the full sequence of 24.

Hi Fxtraderpro, Just finished reading the thread and it seems very interesting. Congratulations to you though, on taking the time to actually prepare the posts with the tables and posting them. I am sure as a trader, you spend enough time in front of the computer, and the last thing you want to do is spend more time after trading!! I just hope this does not go down the line of presenting a lot of information, but when it comes to the crunch factor, it suddenly becomes for sale. After thinking about it, it does seem to be a very well thought out strategy. But I think there is a lot more that remains to be "disclosed". Especially the specifics of entry. The way I read it is,you are basically waiting for the price to break out of a 10pip "range". Time frame once you entered would be basically irrelevant, but getting the entry time frame would be critical. Judging with your tables, this is would not be a strategy that actually makes you a decent amount of % return per capital at risk!! Would you care to share what sort of percentage returns based on the leverage you have recommended, are you acheiving. I look forward to reading more of your posts and giving your ea a try. Regards, K.

howard, As I mentioned at the end of my last Post, I trade this LIVE at a popular MT4 Broker where I was able to obtain 400:1 Leverage. I do NOT generally need 400:1, however, this does permit me to Trade the Strategy "safely" with an account size of just under $50,000 (see TABLE 1.3 in Post #24). You are correct that a $100,000 account would be necessary at 100:1 to be able to handle a complete Sequence of 24 Entries. Understand, that it is possible to Trade this with a considerably smaller account if one would determine that a 20 Entry Sequence (or even less) was suitable to the individual Trader. Personally, I prefer to have the ability to last up to 24, although I have never needed to last that long. Dan

kermut, Thank you for your comments. There actually is not that much more to disclose in the way I trade this, except for the EA that I use to manage my Trades which I will be Posting shortly. Other than the Money Management concepts, this is not a complicated Strategy. Once the MM and the associated risk is understood and accepted by a Trader, trading the Method is a matter of finding an Initial Entry that attempts to avoids a tight 10 Pip range before moving either 40 Pips in our selected direction or 50 Pips in the opposite direction. The nice thing about the Strategy is that in allows me to be "wrong" about my directional choice. Also, how many times have you had a trade start to go against you (stopping you out) and then move your way OR start to move your way and then completely reverse? This Method allows a Trader to profit either way. Regarding the specifics for entry, there are many ways to play this. You need to understand that this is not so much a Strategy that says do A,B &amp; C, as it is a METHOD of executing a Trading Plan. What I look for in terms of an Entry Signal, is typically an area of Support or Resistance with the idea that a either a Breakout or a Retracement will occur at one of these areas. I consider the general volatility of the Pair I am looking at and also the Average Daily Range for past few days and weeks. I also consider whether there are any economic releases during the day that could make the Pair move. Remember that I am looking for a 40 to 50 Pip move to occur BEFORE my 10 Pip Stop is hit more than up to 24 times and I try and focus on entering when the PROBABILITY that my target will be hit is higher than my stop being hit that often. Having stated the above, I am sure that there are many Trend following entry signals that a Trader could use effectively to trade this Method. The S and R concept is just what I use and have found effective. For your reference I look at several timeframes from 5 Minute to 4 Hour, however, I generally draw my S &amp; R areas on a 30 Minute Chart. Regarding returns....I am of the OPINION that many who frequent these boards are under the impression that a Forex Trader can "Trade for a Living" starting with a $5K - $10K Account. Now, perhaps there are some that are doing this or have done that, but I am not one of those "lucky few". What I can say is that a 100%+ annual return is achievable in my experience. Dan

Hello all......I am attaching the EA to this Post along with some information on how to set this up in MT4 for those who are not that familiar with the Platform. Please note that the EA Posted is something that I paid a professional programmer to code for me and that I wish to retain control over for the time being. For this reason, I have decided not to share the code, so please do not ask me to.....Thanks, Dan The FXTradepro Manager Expert Advisor: I use the FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy every day and would find it almost impossible to do so without using my FXTradepro Manager Expert Advisor . I do not personally believe in using fully automated Trading Systems, however, using a "robot" to MANAGE trades that are made using my own signals and discretion for entry has made a big difference in my Trading results. The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy can be traded manually, however, you would need to be at the Trade Terminal constantly to manage and monitor your positions. Therefore, I highly recommend using the Expert Advisor (EA) which is included in this Post. The MetaTrader 4 Platform (MT4), which is available FREE from many Forex Brokers and MarketMakers, permits trading with the Expert Advisor. Expert Advisor: Please download from the bottom of this Post FXTradepro Manager 24 - SEPT 2007 This EA will EXPIRE and no longer function on October 5, 2007 at 23:59 Broker Server Time. A version for use in the month of October 2007 will be available on this Forum beginning October 1, 2007. How to Add the EA to your MT4 Platform: This next step assumes that you have the MT4 Platform installed on your Computer. If you do not, then please sign up for a DEMO with a Broker that offers the Platform. After you have downloaded the EA from the bottom of this Post, you need to COPY the Expert into the "EXPERTS" folder in your MT4 Platform. Here is a quick and easy way to accomplish that.[*] Right click on the SHORTCUT Icon of your Brokers MT4 Platform[*] Select PROPERTIES [*] Click the FIND TARGET (or Open File Location) Button on the Shortcut TAB[*] Locate the EXPERTS Folder in the Window and open it[*] Drag the FXTradepro Manager EA into the EXPERTS Folder [*] Close all Windows[*] Start up your MT4 Platform You should now find the EA in the MetaTrader NAVIGATOR window on the left-hand side of the Trading Platform listed under Expert Advisors . If you need further assistance with setting any of this up, please post your questions or email me and I will help you through the process. EA Settings and Loading the EA to Trade: In order to set-up the Expert Advisor to Trade for the first time you will need to do the following. Double-Click on the EA in the NAVIGATOR window and a Dialog Box will open showing the COMMON Tab in the window. Please review the Illustration below and make certain that your settings match these. http://aycu29.webshots.com/image/217...3610403_rs.jpg When you are finished matching the settings in the COMMON Tab , click OK In order to set up the EA to begin Trading there are several External Variable settings that we can modify to meet specific needs. I will outline each variable in this Post and provide the settings that I generally use. To view these setting double-click on the EA in the Navigator window which opens up the EA Dialog Box, select the INPUTS Tab and you will see the following fields which we will modify as needed. http://aycu06.webshots.com/image/229...5598451_rs.jpg http://aycu06.webshots.com/image/254...5718429_rs.jpg http://aycu21.webshots.com/image/247...9496840_rs.jpg http://aycu03.webshots.com/image/240...7711056_rs.jpg Once you have set the External Variables you can then set the EA on your chart to begin a Trade by clicking "ok". Again, if you need further assistance with setting any of this up, please post your questions or email me and I will help you through the process. Charts and Indicators: In the next post I will explain how to set up your charts in MT4 with the various Indicators I use.

fxtradepro, thanks for posting the system for FREE..........for a moment, i thought you were trying to sell the EA ............ i remember seeing someone posting a method very similar this strategy at another forum - the guy says you will eventually land on the right side of the trend (at least for the short term) so maybe can manually adjust the TP ? if i'm not wrong, the results of this system will favour a trending market rather than a ranging one ?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Does Sept 24 mean this EA is a trial and has a expiry date?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
The indicators I am Posting were NOT created by me and many are available publicly. In some cases I have modified them for my own use and I have changed all the names to include “FXTradepro” for the sake of continuity with the Strategy. MT4 Charts and Indicators: I use the following Chart set-up and Indicators on my MT4 Platform. The Indicators I use are available for download at the bottom of this Post. Additionally, I have included a TEMPLATE for you to use so that once you have added the Indicators to your MT4 Platform you will have the same set-up that I have on my Charts. I will explain how to set this all up in this Post. You do not need to use my set-up to Trade with the FXTradepro Manager EA . Remember, the EA is not fully automated in that we select the Initial Entry to begin the Sequence Of Trades . You may set your Charting up however you like. I include the Indicators and Template here for those who wish to look at the same Charts as I do. Chart Set-Up: I prefer Candlestick Charts, however, this is a personal preference Time Frame: I use Multiple Time Frames from 5 minute to Daily, however, my main chart is a 30 minute Time Frame. Indicators: Please download from the bottom of this Post. These are the Indicators I have on my Charts. I DO NOT really use them for entry signals but rather to give me a feel for what is going on in the Market (along with Price, which is the KING of all Indicators). As I indicated above previously, you do not need these Indicators to trade the Strategy and you can use any Indicators that you like or prefer. FXTradepro ADR (Average Daily Range) Indicator FXTradepro SuperTrend w/Alert FXTradepro SuperTrend Histogram FXTradepro T or R (Trend or Range) Indicator FXTradepro Candle Closing Time FXTradepro Clock FXTradepro Chart Template How to Add the Indicators to your MT4 Platform: After you have downloaded the Indicators and Chart Template, you need to put them in the proper location in your MT4 Platform. The Indicators go in the INDICATORS Folder which is located inside the EXPERTS Folder and the Template goes in the TEMPLATES Folder , which is in the same area as the EXPERTS Folder . Here is a quick and easy way to accomplish this. For the Indicators: Right click on the SHORTCUT Icon of your Brokers MT4 Platform Select PROPERTIES Click the FIND TARGET (or Open File Location)Button on the Shortcut TAB Locate the EXPERTS Folder in the window and open it Locate the INDICATORS Folder in the window and open it Drag all the Indicators into the INDICATORS Folder (not the Template) For the Template: Right click on the SHORTCUT Icon of your Brokers MT4 Platform Select PROPERTIES Click the FIND TARGET (or Open File Location) Button on the Shortcut TAB Locate the TEMPLATES Folder in the window and open it Drag the FXTradepro Chart Template into the TEMPLATES Folder Close all Windows &amp; Start up your MT4 Platform Setting Up Your Charts with the Indicators &amp; Template: Now that you have the Indicators and Template loaded into the MT4 Platform, this is what you do to get everything set on a Chart. Open a new Chart from the FILE Menu on the Platform Once the Chart is open, right click on the Chart. A pull-down menu will appear. Select TEMPLATE. Another pull-down sub-menu will appear. Select FXTradepro Chart Template . Now you should have the same Chart showing as I do. You can do this same procedure for any Currency Pair that you wish to follow. Below, I have Posted a picture of the Chart set-up along with the Indicators and Template. http://aycu37.webshots.com/image/234...4960362_rs.jpg If you need further assistance with setting any of this up, please post your questions or email me and I will help you through the process. Dan

Scott, 24 is part of the EA name. FXTradepro Manager 24 (for 24 Entry Levels). As noted in the EA and Indicators Post the posted version will expire on October 5th, at which time I will post another working version. I hope this does not pose any problem. Dan

--- 帖子 #35 ---
findcount, You can adjust the TP manually if you desire. I do not do this however. Regarding Trending or Ranging Markets....Trending is excellent and Ranging can be ok, assuming that the range is greater than 50 Pips for my set-up. I hope this helps.... Dan

Ok, I am going to cut to the chase here. I am a moderator as I am sure you know... This is a very nice presentation and I thank you for it... Very professional. However, Self Promotion is not allowed here at FF without prior approval from the Admin, so if this is not a promotion, that is just great and you are to be commended.. If it is a way of building a following and then charging for the services, that would be considered self promotion and would cause the thread to be deleted and the member to be banned. I am just laying my cards out, so we understand each other I mean nothing other than that. It would just be a shame to lead people down a path and then discontinue that. So, do I have your assurance that this is not the case? If so, this could develop into a very interesting thread, if not, in all fairness, I do not want to waste your valuable time... Thanks for your understanding in this,

I'm sure your system of determining entry is why you've been successful with this system, rather than the money management aspect of it. The money management strategy sounds a whole like like the 'foolproof' system I created for playing Roulette at the Casino a few years back! I won for ages using this system, but unfortunately then blew up my entire accumulated winnings and the money I had initially started with on one run of 14 reds in a row. Standard probability theory states that the odds of 14 reds coming up in a row is something in the vicinity of 87178291200 to 1, but it still happened. In the end, each entry in my case was a 50/50 event, and that's what I lost track of. In the case of your trading system, each seperate event is way further stacked in favour of hitting your stop loss unless your entries are really good and have really good reasons for them. Please don't take this as my trying to warn the original poster away from this system, because if his system for determining entries is good, then he will make money. I'm warning people who want to fully automate this or just treat it like a coin toss that there is every chance that your entire account will be blown up at some point when the laws of probability just decide it's time to bite you on the ass. Look back to my Roulette example to see what I'm talking about there. It's the same thing. As is the case with any system, it can only be successful because of discretion and all of the intangibles that help traders decide what a good entry is and what a bad entry is. If the market is really choppy, there is EVERY chance you will lose and lose a lot unless you are careful with that initial entry.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Scott, I understand your position. I was, for a time, considering a paid service but have decided against it as I prefer to spend my time trading. That decision has prompted me to Post the Strategy here at Forex Factory. If enough people show an interest, I will continue. Understand, however, that there are those who would take this information and try to Sell it as there own, so as a precaution I will not Post my EA Code or any open version of the EA, as I do wish to retain some control over it. If this poses any problems, please let me know and we can close the thread now. Regards, Dan

Thank you so much for being up front with me... This will be fine... and have a great weekend Regards,

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Very good point nathbear...... I agree that this should NOT be fully automated and that a discretionary entry is the key to success. The point being that the discretionary entry does not always need to be 100% correct to be successful. What I try and do is stay away from entering at a point where the Market seems to be ranging tightly and where that condition is likely to continue for awhile. I am careful about when and how I start a Sequence Of Trades and do not Trade simply because I like or need the action. I Trade when I believe that an opportunity exists for my Strategy to profit. Thanks, Dan

Thank you Scott..........And a GREAT Weekend to you too. Dan

Good Lord I've posted nearly this exact same strategy twice on this forum: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...395#post178395 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=31337 This thread has a five star rating, but when I originally posted this Merlin moved it to the "Beginner Q &amp; A" thread. Burgerking made nearly the exact same EA, and it's posted on that thread.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
tdion, Welcome.....It is said that great minds think alike and neither you or I are the first to come up with this basic concept. As I stated in my first Post... "The basic premise of the Strategy is not entirely new, nor do I claim that it is 100% original, however, I have “made it my own” and found a way to trade it profitably" ..... I hope you will contribute something useful here. Dan

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I just find it amusing that it is suddenly en vogue. Your presentation was more professional than mine, which probably made a better sell. Well Burgerking claims to make up to 1% a day trading GBP/USD w/ the semi-Martingale EA he made (called the BurgerHedge EA if I remember correctly.) Although highly improbable, I have found occasions where meltdown could have occured. The purpose of the Blackbeard's Grid was to push the TP out VERY far.... so that the lot size remains extremely small on the recoups, thus keeping drawdowns very low.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Very interesting thread . Fxtradepro made it very easy to understand the concept of this system. good job and thanks for sharing your hard work. I will certainly try your ea and post my result next week.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
gambler997 and everyone, Please remember that the EA is only a MANAGER of the Sequence Of Trades. You must look for a pair that you believe will hit 40 Pips in your selected direction or 50 Pips in the OPPOSITE direction while attempting to avoid a tight 10 Pip range. DO NOT ENTER RANDOMLY ! I hope that I have been clear on this point. Dan

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes I know this is why it's so interesting.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
tdion, I am not sure that we can consider this "Style" of Trading "en vogue" just yet. By my count there are really only about 8 - 10 Members that appear to want to try the Strategy. Also, in my testing and Live Trading of the Strategy I found that generally speaking the larger TP of 40 has worked as well for me or better than a smaller TP setting of 25. It's true that a 25 Pip TP will get hit sooner, however, I have found that most of the trades that hit the 25 Pip Target eventually went on to 40 Pips or more. The larger TP value also created a better Return for the same relative DrawDown with a 10 Pip Stop. Thanks for your comments... Dan

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks gambler997..........I am glad this point was clear to you. Dan

this auto system is breaking the first rule to automated trading system: #1 Absolute Capital Preservation. #2 should be profitability. like someone mentioned, you might think, hey i will never get 13 reds in a row, the likelihood of that is low. believe me, it WILL happen, and your account will be wiped clean. its not hard to achieve something like high 90%+ success rate, its capital preservation that is important. so far, i've never seen a 90%+ system that was able to keep money protected reasonably. all my past system revolved around that high success rate, yet i couldn't fix that one possible but very rare trade that would kill my account. anyways, good stuff.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
What is the difference in just closing out your position and reversing??? You are just locking in loses when you buy after a sell... it does nothing but help you pretend you did not just assume a loss.. I did not read through the whole strategy so I apologize if I am missing a critical point here, but if the strategy is the same thing I came across a while ago (which I am almost sure it is just from the illustrations) then it is a death sentence for any trader who tries to do this in the long run

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I think the Semi-Martingale strategy is great. However, theoretically I suppose one could have 25 consecutive trades go against him/her. I think a way to protect capital preservation &amp; offset the risk of 25 bad trades is to do what I would call a "leap frog" trend martingale. For example, instead of selling each trade at the 10 Pip stop-loss, let it ride through the next corrresponding retracement. At which point, the corresponding trade, which would be only two trades away, would be twice the original trade. Also, at that point you would sell the original position. This liquidates your initial trade at no profit-no loss, but frees up your capital &amp; in effect transfers the profit potential to the next corresponding trade, which is only two trades away. I am new to the forex market; however, I'm quite familar to the options market and I am trying to learn this arena quickly. However, a major criteria for me to trade in the forex market is to enure that I can make a profit while hedging my position. I don't think a better method (safer &amp; more profitable) than what I'm trying to lay-out exists. I have not tried this method, the "leap frog" trending martingale. However, perhaps it can take the Semi-Martingale strategy to the next level. Please let me know if I'm off target... Thanks, Walt

Hello jjk2......The Strategy is NOT an "automated trading system".

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hello superdezign.................Perhaps you should read the entire Thread before commenting. We do close our previous position when we reverse direction and we do realize the loss. The aggregate losses are overtaken when we eventually hit our target. Dan

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Walt, Thanks for your comments. I agree that it is possible that one could lose 25 times in a row and perhaps that will eventually happen to me. So far it has not. In my opinion, Trading is about PROBABILITIES and what I attempt to do is work that belief in my favor. I am not saying that your idea does not have merit, because it may very well be a good idea. I try to keep things as simple as possible with my Trading so that I can focus on making good choices. Remember that I always have the ability to STOP a Sequence Of Trades and assume a loss at any stage in the progression. I do not say that anyone should Trade this blindly. One must understand the System and work the Market as such. Dan

--- 帖子 #56 ---
FXTradepro, Other than the EURUSD, do you know of any other pair that works well with this strategy. I believe a volatile pair, such as GBPJPY would work well with a TP of 80 and a SL of 30.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hello jones247, A TP of 80 and a SL of 30 would require a different Lot Size Sequence than I am Trading. An 80/20 set-up would use the same Lot Sizing that I use at 40/10, however, you would need a Larger Account to handle the Margin to a 24 Entry Sequence. I do not Trade GBPJPY but I am sure that there are many different combinations of Pairs and Settings that would be effective. I monitor the following 7 Pairs and always use the 40/10 set-up; The pairs are EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD. Also, for your information, a larger SL will also require a Larger Account to sustain a Sequence to a high number of Entries. Dan

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Man, this thread is getting longer quicker than I had thought. A very good presentation of your system fxtraderpro. The main thing i can deduce from your posts is that patience is key. As with any other method of trading, where patience is impt, and one has to let the trade come to them, rather than chasing one, the same principles apply to this. What I like about it is that you do not need to be correct in your initial entry, as you have stated. As far as results go, just breaking even in one's first year of trading would be a huge achievement. There are several places I think this strategy could work, eg major market open times, pivot levels. Pairs like eur/usd, gbp/usd are pretty good at respecting pivots, in normal market conditions. Though i am a happy scalper atm, diversification is good, so I look forward to applying your strategy next week. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I don't know what happened to my post... Did I do something wrong???

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hello kermut and thanks for dropping in. Your comments are correct and appreciated. Patience in selecting the Initial Entry is important. I have had good success with both EURUSD and GBPUSD. Dan

--- 帖子 #61 ---
hello again jones247, I am not sure I understand what you are talking about above? Did you Post something that was removed? Dan

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hello Dan, Thank you for your presentation and sharing your EA with us. Keep up the good work! Questions: 1) When EA gets to the 24th sequence, the lots would be 65.5. However, with a mini account @ InterbankFX, they do not allow to trade more than 50 lots, and hence EA will get "invalid trade volume" error when it gets to 24th sequence and will not be able to place that trade. How do we handle this situation? 2) When I trade GBPJPY, the spreads = 9 at IBFX. What should TP &amp; SL be set to? 3) With a mini account and leverage 1:400, what are the sequence of lots to be set in the Multi-lots section of EA? 4) When EA stops trading after hitting TP, how do you activate EA again for the next trade entry? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
See the thread "Martingale EA. Almost Can't Lose. Read post # 39, 50 &amp; 52 (especially #52). I think that BurgerKIng &amp; FXTradepro understand the opportunity for this strategy. Although his EA doubles up, which demands greater money management. I will e-mail BurgerKing and invite him to this thread, as I believe he will add excellent value to it.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi FxTrade, your idea is very nice and i think most people think about doing this but they didn't improve the system, so let's try to make this workout. I think that 10 pips SL is too little, i think we might let the trade run setting like 25 SL and 60 TP for G/U since we have a 100+ ATR. Did you tried a bigger SL and TP? I'm waitting to Sunday open so i can test your EA. BTW, thanks for the EA and Indicators and congrats for the professional presentation. Regards

Hello EATrader......I will try and answer your questions: 1) I have prepared some information about using the Strategy on an IBFX Mini Account (and also on their Standard Account - see below). These TABLES are for use with my standard TP &amp; SL Settings of 40/10 but should address your question about what to do in regard to their 50 Mini-Lot restriction. INTERBANKFX - A Broker with an Unusual MT4 Platform IBFX's MT4 Platform is uniquely different than MOST other MT4 Platforms and offers some additional flexibility in Lot Size configuration which has an effect on Margin and Leverage considerations. An IBFX Standard Account permits the following Lot Size increments: 1.0 Lots = 100,000 Units = $10. per Pip 0.1 Lots = 10,000 Units = $1. per Pip .01 Lots = 1,000 Units = $0.10 per Pip As you can see IBFX offers MICRO Lots of 1,000 Units on their Standard Account. Most other MT4 Broker's DO NOT. This means that an IBFX Standard Account can be used with a SMALLER Account Balance as compared to a typical Standard Account because of this Lot Size flexibility. Please review TABLE 1.6 below and notice that the Mini and Micro Lot capabilities of the IBFX MT4 Platform enables us to Trade at 1/2 the normal position size of a regular Standard Account. It is true that Profits would also be smaller using this set-up, however, for those wishing to trade the Strategy with less funds, IBFX offers a good option. Generally, IBFX offers 100:1 on their Standard Account and you can also trade our regular Lot Sequence configuration as detailed in TABLE 1.2 in the Leverage and Margin Post. http://aycu22.webshots.com/image/230...0686020_rs.jpg TABLE 1.6 - IBFX STANDARD Account with Standard, Mini &amp; Micro Lots Permitted - 100:1 Leverage IBFX also has an unusual method of Lot Sizing on their Mini Account Platform that permits the following Lot Size increments: 1.0 Lots = 10,000 Units = $1. per Pip 0.1 Lots = 1,000 Units = $0.10 per Pip .01 Lots = 100 Units = $0.01 per Pip (Nano Lots) Notice that in an IBFX Mini Acount a Lot Size of 1.0 = 10,000 Units and NOT 100,000 Units as it does on most other MT4 Broker's Platforms. Additionally, they permit the use of NANO Lots of 100 Units which can be useful when LIVE Testing the Platform and Strategy. Also, IBFX calculates Margin Requirements so that $50 in Margin is required to open each 1.0 Mini Lot position at 200:1 Leverage. When Trading at IBFX on their Mini Account Platform and using our default Lot Sizing in a Sequence Of Trades you must be aware of the following restriction. IBFX's Mini Account does not permit Lot Sizes of more than 50 Mini Lots PER CLICK. What this means is that the FXTradepro Manager EA cannot enter any positions that are greater than 50 Mini Lots. The results of this restriction is that our standard Sequence Of Trades when trading a Mini Account at IBFX is reduced to a MAXIMUM of 22 Entries regardless of our Account Size. In this case we set the Lot Size Parameters to "0" in MLot23 and MLot24 of the EA. Please review TABLE 1.7 below for details regarding the use of the Strategy with an IBFX Mini Account at 200:1 Leverage. TABLE 1.8 details an IBFX Mini Account at 400:1. http://aycu03.webshots.com/image/242...2269501_rs.jpg TABLE 1.7 - IBFX MINI Account with Mini, Micro &amp; Nano Lots Permitted - 200:1 Leverage http://aycu19.webshots.com/image/246...1203786_rs.jpg TABLE 1.8 - IBFX MINI Account with Mini, Micro &amp; Nano Lots Permitted - 400:1 Leverage 2) I don't Trade GBPJPY and I am not familiar with the "personality" of this Pair, however, I would guess that a SL of maybe 20 would be more suitable since I understand that this Pair is quite volatile. If you or someone else can tell me what they feel (based upon some experience) would be a suitable SL then I should be able to calculate a Lot Size Sequence for that Pair. Also, please note that the TP SHOULD be at least 2x-4x the SL setting. 3) See TABLE 1.8 above 4) After a Target has been hit, the EA will go to a Hibernate Mode (if Hibernate is set to TRUE). To restart the EA you would remove it from the Chart, change the Magic Number and then re-attach to the Chart setting your Entry Parameter for either a Timed Entry, A Price Entry or an Immediate Entry. As a side note, if Hibernate is set to FALSE, the EA will automatically restart the Sequence at the MLOT1 sizing and continue the Sequence automatically. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AND ALWAYS KEEP HIBERNATE SET TO TRUE. I hope you understand these points. Dan

Hi BGazzoni, I have tried many different settings all with reasonable success. The 10 Pip SL is pretty tight but after trying many things I seem to like this the best, BUT only for pairs with a Spread or 5 or Less (less is better of course). You must understand that the Larger the SL is than the Larger your Account will need to be in order to sustain the Sequence to 24 Entries. I have stuck with 10 for that reason and because it works for me. By the way, I Trade GBPUSD often with the 40/10 setting and it has worked well. Remember that I focus on the INITIAL ENTRY placement and try to avoid getting caught in a tight range and whipsawed too many times. Dan

--- 帖子 #67 ---
jones247.........Correct me if I am wrong but it looks to me like BurgerKing was Hedging and not taking any loss and closing all Buys and Sells at the same time when his Target was hit. If this is the case, I have also Traded that way and find that taking the losses at each level in the progression, as we are discussing here, to be much better in regards to Lot Sizing and Margin Usage. As far as your emailing BK.....all are invited. Dan

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hello Dan, Thanks for your helpful answers. Follow up questions: 1) I think SL 20 and TP 40-80 for GBPJPY should be suitable. Please calculate a lot size sequence for this pair so I can test EA on Monday. 2) You stated that "After a Target has been hit, the EA will go to a Hibernate Mode (if Hibernate is set to TRUE). To restart the EA you would remove it from the Chart, change the Magic Number..." Why do we need to change the Magic Number? Since you remove it from the chart and re-attach, the Magic Number has already been reset. In other words, once we remove EA from the chart, EA is not going to remember the last Magic Number when we re-attach. It will start as a new EA. I don't understand this part. Thanks. 2) I don't Trade GBPJPY and I am not familiar with the "personality" of this Pair, however, I would guess that a SL of maybe 20 would be more suitable since I understand that this Pair is quite volatile. If you or someone else can tell me what they feel (based upon some experience) would be a suitable SL then I should be able to calculate a Lot Size Sequence for that Pair. Also, please note that the TP SHOULD be at least 2x-4x the SL setting. 4) After a Target has been hit, the EA will go to a Hibernate Mode (if Hibernate is set to TRUE). To restart the EA you would remove it from the Chart, change the Magic Number and then re-attach to the Chart setting your Entry Parameter for either a Timed Entry, A Price Entry or an Immediate Entry. As a side note, if Hibernate is set to FALSE, the EA will automatically restart the Sequence at the MLOT1 sizing and continue the Sequence automatically. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AND ALWAYS KEEP HIBERNATE SET TO TRUE. I hope you understand these points. Dan[/quote]

First i would like to say that 20 pips SL on Gbp/Jpy is giving your money away, it might be at least 40 (forgetting the 9 pips spread), just my oppinion. I just said to get a bigger SL and TP would provide us to be wrong with more space, cause 10 pips is to little and if you discount the spread at Cable on IBFX your stop would be just 6 pips, so you have to get a really nice entry point. And the pairs you mentioned most of them have a trend so 60 pips wouldn't be so hard to get. I'm just saying that cause i'm most of swing trader and i can't get the exactly entry point, but i have a nice r:r. Well, i'll start trying on sunday with my own settings so we could compare the results. Thanks again and have a good weekend

Hi very nicwe work . Quick question up to what sequence of trade this system will still be profitable. Ex give 2 example if target hit at 5 sequence you will be stil in profit of $ 90 How about if your target hit at 7 , 8 , 9, 10 ,11 ,12 ----or the worse 15 16 17 18 etc. Can you give the loss and profit for each sequence from 6-24 for $0.10 , $1.00 or $10 (per pips) value I am not lazy I did some calculation but not sure I did it correct. I asked you this favour for All traders. keep up the good works

--- 帖子 #71 ---
EATrader, Here is a TABLE detailing an 80 Pip TP and 20 Pip SL. The Lot Sizing works out to the same as my Standard 40/10 settings because the ratio is the same. Because of the larger SL, however, a larger account is needed to Trade with these settings. The TABLE below is for an IBFX Mini Account at 400:1 Leverage. Regarding the Magic Number question, I always change it and this is what I was told to do by the programmer who did this for me. I do not know anything about coding so I can't give you a better answer and perhaps you are right on this point. http://aycu10.webshots.com/image/226...7294222_rs.jpg

Hi Dan, Interesting variation on an old theme, and an excellent presentation of your system. I like this type of trading tool (and you obviously use it in the context of a tool only), since it allows the trader to dumb down the trading risk considerably at point of trade entry (as long as they have a specific trade entry plan). The tool takes care of the exit and the MM nicely. Several Questions: 1/ You mentioned the returns you are generating are approximately 100% per annum. This is an excellent return. Can you tell us how often you are running the EA per day (on average) to achieve this? 2/ Can you please elaborate on your decision criteria for entry based on group of indicators you are using (and have also kindly provided for us)? 3/ Can you please clarify how the system/ EA reacts to the broker blowing out the spread, to say 20 pips for ~3 minutes, during volatile news releases? I saw some comment on this in a post earlier but I am still trying to understand how it actually has affected your live trading...presumablely you get a number of rapid/instant open, close, reverse direction, open, close, reverse direction .... causing some build up of loosing trades??? Yet your response was that it didn't cause you too much of a problem... can you please explain further. (Obvioulsy one solution is not to trade with the EA until the spreads have settled down again....) As previoulsy discussed the key to longevity for this type of 'marty' trading is the entry decision - the tool merely lowers the risk of being wrong. The nature of the 'risk structure' (i.e. the Martingale approach) and the system itself means that getting the entry correct is really the only critical issue. It is easy to see why you have been successful using this tool - since for most traders the entry is (relatively speaking) the easy part to work out, and the more difficult parts are the MM and the exit (mainly due to self imposed psychological pressures). Looking forward to your response to my questions. Well done. Tim

shows that great minds think alike ! since both of you not charging any money for this, right ? so importantly, the method must work.........in fact it will work but one must have deep pockets or the profits will be too small.......... also, balls of TITANIUM are needed. to keep the faith is most important for this method. those trying this out must have very strong discipline and faith.

I won't reinvest profit in this system because, One day your initial deposit will be probably all lost but the odds are so small. You will probably make a lot more money before . You must have some experience to trade system like that. avoiding big news and only trading during volatile hour and I think you will have some serious success with this system. I trade forex for more than 4 years and I tried and created a lot of systems but this one is by far the most logical. Most trader have good strategy but poor money management, if so this ea is for you. sorry for my bad english but my first language is french.

Here is how the Trade worked out PROFITABLY starting the Sequence Of Trades with 0.1 Standard Lot which equals 10,000 Units (1 Mini Lot): THIS WHAT I MEAN #1 - Initial Entry - SELL 0.1 Lot: SL hit -10 Pips @ $1. per Pip = -$10. #2 - 2nd Entry - BUY 0.1 Lot: SL hit - 10 Pips @ $1. per Pip = -$10. #3 - 3rd Entry - SELL 0.2 Lots: SL hit - 10 Pips @ $2. per Pip = -$20. #4 - 4th Entry - BUY 0.3 Lot: SL hit - 10 Pips @ $3. per Pip = -$30. #5 - 5th Entry - SELL 0.4 Lots: TP hit +40 Pips @ $4. per Pip = +$160. TOTAL = $160 - $70 in aggregate losses = $90 PROFIT for the Sequence # 6 what will be your profit here it target hit at # 6 entry #7 '' " # 7 entry 8, 9, 10 , 11, 12 , 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 what will be your profit/loss for each of these entry (if target hit either one) can you make a chart please. Becasue the chart you give not reflect your example. entry: 1 -$10---or 40+ 2. -$10--or 40+ 3.-$20---or 80+ 4.- $ 30 ---or 120 if you continue u will see that if you your target hit at 10entry = 9lots*40=360 - lot1---lot 8 = 10+10+20+30+40+50+60+70+80=370 360-370 = -10 so form the 10 sequence or entry or trade you will be at lost. Please let me know if I did the math correct

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hello again zamamib, I don't think you are calculating this correctly....Please see the TABLE below: This is a Standard Account with 400:1 Leverage and Mini Lot Trading Permitted. http://aycu12.webshots.com/image/243...6647255_rs.jpg If you read this TABLE from LEFT TO RIGHT you will see exactly what the calculations are for a 10 Pip SL and a 40 Pip TP. At the 6th entry if the TP is hit then the NET Profit after the AGGREGATE Losses of the first 5 Trades in the Sequence is +$130.00 . If the SL was hit at the 6th Entry then the Aggregate Losses (or the DrawDown if you will) is -$170.00 . Let's say for example that this trade keeps losing until the 12th Entry. That would mean that after the 11th Entry hits the SL then the AGGREGATE Losses to that point would be -$980.00 , however, when the TP hits at the 12th Entry the GAINS would overtake the previous Loss by +$460.00 I hope this explains things more clearly to you. Dan

Hello Dan, When I attached the EA on a chart, there are errors "Error opening SELL order: 4109" &amp; "Error opening BUY order: 4109". These errors continually appears in the "Experts" tab. Is there a bug in the EA? Here's what I did. I attached the EA on a chart but uncheck "Allow live trading" because I'm not ready for an entry yet. EA just sits there waiting. However, it keeps generate these errors. Another thing I notice is that the comment printed on the upper left corner saying that "FXTradepro Manger is Trading", but this is misleading because EA is not really trading. The "Allow live trading" is unchecked so how can it be trading? Please explain. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
EATrader.....The Expert works fine on my Platforms and the Platforms of several of my Friends. Why would you uncheck "Allow Live Trading"? DO NOT uncheck allow LIVE Trading. Set it up just as I have detailed in previous Posts. Also, DO not attach to a Chart until you have set one of the Entry Option Parameters, such as Timed Entry or Price Entry....If both of these are set to False the EA will open a Trade after the first tick when applied to your Chart. Try it again.... Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Dan, The reason I uncheck "Allow Live Trading" because I'm not ready to enter the market yet but want EA to be ready on the chart. So when I have an entry or ready to enter the market, then only at that point that I would attach EA on the chart for immediate opening? And after that trade is finished, then I would remove EA from chart and then when I have another entry, I'd attach EA on the chart again? Is this how it should work? Thanks.

I just finished reading this and i think that your presentation is very well thought out. I am trading a similar strategy live for the past 2 weeks after demo for a few months. I only trade e/u with this strategy with stop 20 and tp 20. Direction is determined by open of new day.I have determined the MM a bit differently and have yet to trade more than 5 lots. Congrats on your work so far.

I opened a new thread for jones247 for his interesting idea on minimizing risk, because it deserves a more in depth discussion than it can receive in this thread. It is located here... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=43344 Thanks,

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Gambler, Whilst I agree with your comments on the whole, I am always interested in the general comments that come out whenever a Martingale type trading sequence is proposed. Really your comment about the account blowing up using this method of risk management in a strategy plan - can be applied to any trading system. If, for example, I have a trading system that runs a 60% winning ratio, I still run the risk of blowing up the account just as easily - if my Risk Management approach is poor, e.g. I trade 10% of my account on each trade. Now the chance of making 10 failures in a row (and thus going a long way towards blowing up this account) is 0.4^10 = 0.01 or 1%....probably no less a risk than Dan actually operates with. Dans entry criteria is the key to his success, coupled with the risk management system he is employing - and which he has been good enough to share with us - but also his MONEY MANAGEMENT, which he has based off the broker leverage as a starting point (in other words even if your broker offers you 400:1 you may choose to work off a safer level of risk and trade under say 100:1 or 50:1 equivalent leverage - and thus run a lower net drawdown at any given point on the martingale sequence). I guess my point is that a martingale risk management approach is: (a) only part of the system...don't loose sight of this, (b) is smart - because it lifts the trader out of many of the pyschological trading traps (by creating a defined risk management plan....that can be managed simply by choosing what level of money management you wish to employ), (c) creates a focus on the risk aspects of a trading plan - which is always healthy - since it forces the trader to PLAN there money management carefully. All too often people ring the alarm bells on a Martingale (or even the anti-martingale) risk management methodology - because they forget it is only one component of the trading plan....and not the trading plan itself. The cool thing about the very fact that it does cause people to rush to write up a post attacking this approach (I am not saying you are attacking this method Gambler) - is the very reason why it is, IMO, a smart approach...BECAUSE it focuses us onto the real risk of trading when often we develop a trading approach and really don't truely focus on the risks involved. So a martingale sequence always manages to bring us back to a risk focus, but the smart trader uses it to his(her) advantage, and is not afraid of the consequences of the risk taken (when properly deployed). Tim

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Nice post Tim.....Very well said. Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Without any offence, just ASKING, what is the PROBABILITY of such a sequence that zeros your account with this kind of money managment approach? (ps: As a side note I do know what I am talking about, check my profile) My models are similar that is i take less care about the importance of the entry and more about the exit, position management, static and dynamic risk control (in short money management)

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello bullrock, I am not sure how we would calculate the Probability that you ask about, however, I can say this - Having traded the Strategy for more than a year, just about every day, while being selective about when I enter the Market , I have yet to blow up an Account. Also, note that if that did occur the Account would not go to Zero, however, a very large loss would occur. Dan

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thank you for your proper answer... When I meant to zero I am refering to the situation what you have described. When an investor sees such that "a very large loss" occured almost certainly the account will be zero due to a complete withdrawal and closure. Your system is interesting but for example it is inappropriate to my personality or style for the reason you have described. I am a person who like steady returns with low drwadowns and controlled risk without the risk of having a large loss. I am always looking for more smaller gains with very small losses. Also for example myself when I have a loss I reduce the risk on the next trade. But that's ME and I am happy with that. The method you described is good for YOU as it should otherwise you wouldn't have traded it for a year, would you? Have a pipstatic day.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Also (this would need another thread) I am trdaing GBP/JPY as follows I buy every 5 pips. tp is@25 pips. no SL at all. Use the interest rate to close trades. Money management is very important.. I have been trading since 16 months now with a 1-2% return a month... Interested I will let you know more. I do this on a small research account. So far doing well... I survived the recent sell off as well.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Just to give everyone an idea of how I trade this - following are 2 Trades that I took overnight. These were placed on 2 separate Accounts as I only trade 1 Sequence per Account at any given time. AUDUSD - at around 11 PM EST last night I set the EA to enter using the PRICE ENTRY option, setting the price parameter to .8000 to start a Sequence Of Trades with a SELL Entry - This looked to me like a Resistance area and also is a Round Number at which significant price action generally occurs. The EA opened the SELL Entry once .8000 was reached at 3:35 AM EST and the Initial Entry was filled. The Sequence closed in Profit on the 2nd Entry at 3:49 AM Initial Entry - .10 Lots - Stopped at a 10 Pip Loss = -$10. 2nd Entry - .10 Lots - TP hit at +40 Pips Gain = +$40. NET GAIN = +$30. http://aycu24.webshots.com/image/263...2842376_rs.jpg USDJPY - Also at around 11 PM EST last night I set the EA to enter using the PRICE ENTRY option, setting the price parameter to 115.00 to start a Sequence Of Trades with a SELL Entry - This also looked to me like a Resistance area and also is a Round Number at which significant price action generally occurs. The EA opened the SELL Entry once 115.00 was reached at 3:28 AM EST and the Initial Entry was filled. The Sequence closed in Profit on the 4th Entry at 4:08 AM. Initial Entry - .10 Lots - Stopped at a 10 Pip Loss = -$8.69 2nd Entry - .10 Lots - TP hit at a 10 Pip Loss = -$8.70 3rd Entry - .20 Lots - TP hit at a 10 Pip Loss = -$17.39 4th Entry - .30 Lots - TP hit at +40 Pips Gain = +$103.96 NET GAIN = +$69.18 http://aycu38.webshots.com/image/252...2781653_rs.jpg I hope this is helpful to those who are interested. Dan BY THE WAY - You will notice that on BOTH Trades above, I was NOT CORRECT on my directional Choice. What was important to me was that the likelihood of price either retracing significantly or breaking through the Resistance at the Round Numbers was very high.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Sounds to me like you are doing One Directional Grid Trading - Not my cup of tea but I appreciate your offer to share. Also glad to hear that you are doing well. Good Trading! Dan

Hi Dan Wow It's very interesting you trade this system for more than a year. A long time ago i tried to develope a martingale system but I was not enough smart to create a system like that. What I like with this system Is I enter a trade and lets the ea make all the hard work. thanks you Have a good Day all Ps: I have already win on usd/Jpy l

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thankfully that is just one of my experimental stuffs. 1 of my many models. But interesting. Your method caught my attention because I am always looking for money management techniques and the S/R type of trading and BO is behind my success. The other real accounts I have. I am happy that you are successfull as well. Just be cautious...

Thanks for the contribution gambler997............ Dan

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Please remember folks, I have been trading a system very similar to this for a little bit on demo and went live not too long ago. A system like this needs monitoring especially if you leave it up to an ea to run the orders. Make sure to avoid shifty brokers and news events as they will kill your account with the spread widening. I am not taking away from the system as I am still trading it and looking for alternatives to my ea but just making a warning for those planning on going live with the ea.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I don't know if it is possible to insert a protection in the code for spread widening. When you run an ea like this on a live account, you must have a backup battery for your computer and modem or a power generator. A very reliable broker and internet provider to. But I would not let the ea run if I leave up. too much risky I think

--- 帖子 #106 ---
One of the reasons I had the EA made to trade to 24 levels was to offer some protection against the Broker issues. Regarding power back-up etc, these are issues for all EA's and robots and that is why I had the stops and TP's hard coded so that they exist on the Broker's Server. Dan

--- 帖子 #107 ---
im demoing this since last night on the gbpusd and so far im at 14 level and close to profit. the thing is... because gbpusd is 4 spread it gets stop out more often. I will try eurusd with 2 spread. anyways, i like this system. ive been trading the martingale system successfully so far on the usdcad only for 8 weeks on a live acct. i'm up 33% so far.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
closed for profit at the 14 level!!! i will trade only the European session.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Smaller spreads are a bit easier to deal with, but entering the Initial Entry in the Sequence at the "Best" time/place will help in keeping the number of entries in the Sequence down. Try to avoid a tight range by entering with a SELL at or just above a Resistance point OR by entering a BUY at or just below a Support area - also look to Trade when the market is poised for a move. I rarely get to 14 Entries and I trade GBPUSD often. Dan

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Nice criss.......Level 14 is not the end of the world....You still had 10 Levels to go. The European session has been good to me but I still only trade it when I see an OPPORTUNITY. Select your Trades carefully, that is what will help you avoid the worst case scenario. Dan

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I'm testing the EA also, and i have modified SL and TP for some pairs. GBP/USD - TP=60 SL=25 Spread=4 Level closed=2 USD/JPY - TP=60 SL=20 Spread=3 Level Closed=3 USD/CAD - TP=55 SL=25 Spread=4 Level Closed=3 EUR/USD - TP=40 SL=10 Spread=2 CURRENT LEVEL=6 USD/CHF - TP=50 SL=15 Spread=4 CURRENT LEVEL=12 As I said before, i think a bigger SL and TP would give more space to the trade take the right direction and it wouldn't open so many positions. Well i'll continue testing it's going very good, at least the ones who had bigger SL and TP let's see the others. Regards

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Just remember that when you change the TP and SL settings from my default settings of 40/10 that you MUST recalculate the Lot Sizing Sequence and Margin requirements, otherwise you WILL have a problem. Also, you should not just enter for the sake of Trading. I understand that you are testing but, for example, I would not Trade EURUSD and USDCHF today as they are both stuck in a tight range. Remember that this is a METHOD of executing a Trading Plan and must be used accordingly. Dan

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I know Dan, i just made that cause i want to see the worst case scenario About the lot size i'll do some math today and i'll let you know. Bruno

Hi Dan, Was just wondering, I like your spreadie, I take it's a spreadsheet, do you mind sharing that with us, you can protect or something, just to play about. I think it is a very good strat, as he stated, how many times have you entered the market and it's gone against you and then for it to go in the direction intended! It's happen to loads of time, and this is a live account. I think people can play with SL and TP and depending, i mean I would be happy with TP set to 25 and SL with 10. 20 pips a day, 400 pips a month, not too bad, I guess. Any way I 2 pence worth. Though I will be monitoring this thread with interest like others! Keep it up Dan, sorry I don't mean to be rude and this has been addressed by yourself and the Mod, but I hope you will release the EA without time limitation, as I don't want to play about with the code, but I think this could be a successful system and with playing about with TP and SL (as everyone has different views on what is good for them) this could work! Keep up the good work! Thanks, Guess Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hello Guess.....I did not Post the Spreadsheet/Calculator previously because it may require some explanation to use. Also, I was trying to focus on the Set-Up I use and not get too complicated for those who are newer to the basic concepts of the Strategy. I WILL Post the Spreadsheet now at the bottom of this Post. Please note that I created this SS in OpenOffice and not MS Excel and I have Posted both an OpenOffice version and an Excel version that I converted via OpenOffice in the attached ZIP file. Because of the conversion, I hope that there are no issues for Excel users. Dan

--- 帖子 #117 ---
As Fxtraderpro has said several times, entry price is key. To everyone experimenting with different pairs (since we know it works well on gbp/usd, as fxtraderpro is trading on it), I suggest you look at eur/jpy. It has all the explosive moves of gbp/jpy, with less than half the spread. Get a pivot indicator, and have a look at 1H chart for support and resistance levels. This is a very good method of managing a trade. You just got to enter around the right area. Only thing is, you will not make much $$ per pip as opposed to some other methods. Other methods, 40 pips per day will make you very good returns, but here 40 pips will give you a modest return. Much better than the bank still. Cheers, K.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
What other methods are you referencing? How would their probability profile compare to this one?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Jones, The reason I say this is because, take a look at this $s required in the account required to trade the entire sequence, as recommended by fxtraderpro. Eg. I think to trade at 400:1 margin, you need alteast 20K. Now, we start off trading at less than 1x leverage. In the first few sequences, if our tp is hit at 40pips, the $$ returns are less than if we are trading at say 5x lev eg for PhillipNel's 5M system, or linuxtroll's rainbow etc Don't get me wrong, the more I think about this trade management strategy, the more I like it, and I think it is a brilliant method when you have a large value in your account, as the returns are going to be very very consistent, but modest. I look forward to using this EA, sometime in the near future. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
kermut.......The problem with most people wanting to get into Trading the FX Market is that many think they can Trade for Living starting with very Small Accounts. Perhaps some can. I have not been able to accomplish that. True, I am not boasting about 1% a day or more as many systems claim, however, in any other Market annual returns of 50%-100% would be considered fantastic. Also, there are ways to trade this Strategy/Method with alternate Lot Sizing, a smaller Account and Larger Profits but there is MORE RISK in doing so. One could change the parameters so that a Sequence of Trades does not last as long as the 24 Levels I am discussing and work out calculations that are acceptable to them. Just my opinion........And thanks for your contributions. Dan

--- 帖子 #121 ---
FXTradepro, Do you trade this system full-time? Also, which brokers do you use?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
HI Kermut, I think you will find this method will return exceptional profits if you get your entry part of the strategy plan correct. Reason: 1/ Dan has already stated that he is doing between 4-10 trades per week using this method. This seems very realistic to me. 2/ He also stated that he averages a close in profit after 8 trade sequences of his martingale risk management system. This also sounds very realistic to me. So at 8th close he will make $190 per trade and if you assume an average number of trades per week as 7 (half his range mentioned above) = $1330 per week. This equates to $69,160 per annum !!!!! Now if you are a risk freak you may choose to trade this approach with a 400:1 leverage which means you will need $47,525 per standard account. This gives you a net return of 145% per annum. If you choose to trade this approach with a 200:1 leverage which means you will need $63,900 per standard account. This gives you a net return of 108% per annum. If you choose to trade this approach with a 100:1 leverage which means you will need $96,650 per standard account. This gives you a net return of 72% per annum. Please explain why you consider these as 'modest' returns.....??? Tim PS All this information has been provided by Dan.... when you piece it together like this, I think his trading plan and returns are excellent.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I Trade Full-Time - about 90% this system and a bit of scalping/short term Trading, mostly for kicks. I also have other sources of income but I make the vast majority of my Living Trading FX. I am not sure if I am able to discuss which Brokers I use but if you email me I would be happy to share some information. Regards, Dan

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Since the discussion seems to have turned to Profits and Returns, I would like to caution readers that whatever claims anyone makes on these Public Forums (myself included) should be taken "with a grain of salt". The best way for people to understand the potential of this is to Trade the System on Demo at first, and then on a "smallish" Mini/Micro Account with a suitable Broker. Only over time can one really establish was can be done. I have Traded and "tweaked" this Strategy for some time and have found what I feel is a good way to Trade that fits my personality and goals. As I stated in my first Post - "The FXTradepro Forex Trading Strategy will not make anyone a millionaire overnight or provide the ridiculously high annual returns that many Traders are hoping for, however, I have been able to make consistent gains using a method that I AM COMFORTABLE with." Dan

Totally agree with you Dan. I was infact one of them. thought I could start with 5K and make that into 100k (absolutely possible, over a longer period of time) quickly and then just trade full time off the resultant profits. Lol, like they say, "If only I knew then what I know now". It is like anything new, got to either learn the hard way, or from the mistakes of others. Usually it is the hard way, as can't relate to the mistake until it is personally made. You are correct, making variations to get a bigger return, would entail more risk, and in this business, risk = reward. I love auslanco's quote " a person who enters the market 10 times to make his 100pips" has more risk than the person who enters the market once to make his 100pips. Quite correct to an extent. Trading is so dynamic and fluid, there is a timeframe and a system for every personality. It is just a matter of being honest with oneself and deciding what sort of personality you are. It has been said time and time again, systems don't make the equity curve grow, the trader does. I guess, one thing that could be incorporated into the trade management is a trailing stop, or close partial position at 40 pips and bring the remainder to a net positive pip position such that if it is hit, it will still yield a profit greater than the loss. But this is all something that a individual trader would have to experiment with. I like this system, but feel it would be more suited to a larger account size, with modest returns. I know traders make more than 100%/yr every year. And they are not all using the same strategy!! Still looking forward to using your ea in the near future. Regards, K.

Intelligent comments kermut.....I'm glad you came aboard. Dan

I apologize Dan, it seems that I may have contributed to this thread taking a course that you did not intend it to. Since I actually do like this trade management system, I shall not post on any other tangents and concentrate on the actual system itself. Ok, now lets get back on track and make some pips!!! Regards, K.

No Problem kermut........Your comments are well thought out and appreciated. Dan

What would be a less risky position... GBP/USD with a SL-10 &amp; TP-40, or GBP/JPY with a SL-20 &amp; TP-80 or GBP/JPY with a SL-30 &amp; TP-120. Although they're all on a 1:4 ratio, I assume you may have a feel for the number of sequences before a break-out occurs. I assume that the spread simply reduces the TP accordingly (for example, with a TP of 80, having a spread of 9 pips, then the net profit would be 71 pips minus the SL sequences)...

Hi FXTradepro can you tell me who your programmer is i have a system that has to be programmed so pls send the details to my pm leon

--- 帖子 #131 ---
jones247..........I don't trade GBP/JPY so it is difficult for me to respond to your question. I use the 40/10 set-up on 7 pairs, as I indicated in a previous Post, because this is what has worked for me and also I know, based upon the Average Daily Range, that I will normally be out of the Trade in a few hours to a day at most. All of this is based upon entering under the conditions I like, of course. I never enter blindly. I am not sure that I am following your question about the Spread reducing the TP or if that even needs to be a concern. You might take a look at the FXTradepro Manager Calculator that I Posted earlier and run some of the numbers on GBPJPY if you are interested in that Pair. Another good idea would be to run the EA on GBPJPY on a Demo Account using the various parameters that you mention and see what you can determine by WATCHING. Experience is the best teacher in my opinion and there are no real shortcuts. Remember to use the Calculator to assist you in determining Lot Sizing and Account Size and let me know if I can help. Regards, Dan

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Ive read the entire thread, and find aspects of this method very positive. I did download and run the EA, on EURAUD and the first trade ran 12 stops before a margin call happened. That was my fault, for not being able to pick entries. Right now (asian session) there seems to be a lot of consolidation, so i guess its not a good time to start using this method.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
You need to review everything again....If you got a Margin call at the 12th level then your Account was not large enough. These are important concepts so don't take any shortcuts. Consolidation can be ok so long as you set the Initial Entry OUTSIDE of the consolidation. Reread everything.... Dan

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Easyforex, What is the spread on eur/aud. From memory on mt4, it is usually more than 5 pips. As stated earlier, the entire sequence is based on pairs with spread less than 5 pips. Anything higher, would require lot size to be re-calculated. Cheers, K.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks, Dan...

To further clarify how I trade this System - Here is a Trade that I set-up last night which triggered and closed in profit overnight. EURUSD - at around 11 PM EST last night I set the EA to enter using the PRICE ENTRY option, setting the price parameter to 1.3459 to start a Sequence Of Trades with a BUY Entry - 1.3459 looked to me like a SUPPORT Area. The EA opened the BUY Entry once 1.3459 was reached at 5:29 AM EST and the Initial Entry was filled. The Sequence closed in Profit on the INITIAL Entry at 6:59 AM Initial Entry - .10 Lots - TP hit at +40 Pips Gain = +$40. NET GAIN = +$40. http://aycu33.webshots.com/image/230...6878257_rs.jpg

the ea work like a charm. We have nothing to say exclude thank s for all the nice work you have done. You answer question rapidly with an well detailed explanation. Personally I set the ea to open a trade each night just before london open on eur/usd and I trade usd/jpy when I see an good oportunity .

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Glad it's working for you gambler997......Others have traded my Strategy at the London Open with success also. I prefer that certain other conditions exist as well, as a safety precaution. Basically, I still look for Support or Resistance going into a Sequence. Regards, Dan

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Dan, How do you determine the ideal support or resistance points to enter the sequence? Would you consider using candle sticks or macd or some other indicator to determine the proper entry points? Perhaps using one of the other strategies in this forum to determine the right entry point would be a good strategy. Then use your model if the trade went against the individual. What do you think? Also, would you be willing to consider a SL on every third sequence at a price above the entry point? I think this will lessen the required lots needed for a profit in the following sequence. Therefore you can then choose to extend your sequence beyond 24 or increase the lots (which includes profits) at each sequence. My only concern with this system is that the longer you remain in the sequence the greater the potential loss &amp; the profit potential as a percentage of potential loss declines at an alarmingly increasing rate. Any thoughts from anyone on how to soften the blow after the 16th sequence, for example? Nevertheless, this is a great system for success. However, one failure may be irrevocable... and that is the MAJOR hurdle! Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hello Dan, You said you trade 7 pairs. Which 7 currency pairs that you trade daily? Which pairs work well with the EA? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi jones.....I will answer your questions as best as I can - in RED below: Dan

--- 帖子 #145 ---
EATrader.........Actually, I said that I MONITOR 7 Pairs...They are as I stated previously, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD &amp; NZDUSD. I only take 1 or 2 Trades a day with this set-up and only when I feel conditions are right. Remember that the EA is only a TOOL to manage your trades, it does not make the decisions for us. I hope this is helpful. Dan

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hi Dan, Yes I was wondering if you could provide the EA with no time limit, as I want to go live with this? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Past week was very special, brokers was just protecting themselves and that is fair... Also, it's not because there is no volatility that the spread will not increases ! If there is noone on the market and you have a book allmost empty if some orders 30 pip away one of each other, the broker will also widen it's spread. Try to put yourself in the place of the broker. You are a market provider for ppl wanting to buy orange @ 2$ and ppl wanting to sell orange @ 3$ and you said to your customers that bid/ask difference would not be higher than 1/4$. What do you do ? Do you provide your customer with a 2.375 ask - 2.625 and get screwed both side each time an order is passed or do you increase your spread ?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I ran the EA on the USD/JPY last night around 11 pm central time. It went to the 4th step before it took off and made some profit. I bailed out a little before the 40 pip TP. I was able to lock in 30 pips manualy.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
hi jimbo, Taking profits early is fine, but sometimes fear is our enemy and our emotions must be dealt with. I rarely close early unless I see something that tells me the trade could turn bad, especially at an early position such as the 4th Entry. The beauty of this Method, however, is that we as Traders have a choice as it is not fully automated. Glad it's working for you. Dan

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Here is a Chart of a Trade I took last night (Tuesday)..... USDCAD - At around 7 PM EST last night I set the EA to enter using the PRICE ENTRY option, setting the price parameter to 1.0653 to start a Sequence Of Trades with a SELL Entry - This looked to me like a Resistance area. The EA opened the SELL Entry once 1.0653 was reached at 8:40 PM EST and the Initial Entry was filled. The Sequence closed in Profit on the 5th Entry at 2:42 AM Wednesday. Initial Entry - .10 Lots - Stopped at a 10 Pip Loss = -$9.38 2nd Entry - .10 Lots - Stopped at a 10 Pip Loss = -$9.39 3rd Entry - .20 Lots - Stopped at a 10 Pip Loss = -$18.77 4th Entry - .30 Lots - Stopped at a 10 Pip Loss = -$28.18 5th Entry - .40 Lots - TP hit at +40 Pips Gain = +$150.84 NET GAIN = +$85.12 http://aycu14.webshots.com/image/268...9159549_rs.jpg Good Trading to ALL Dan

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi, i started yesterday a new approach with this system. I made the lots bigger, also SL and TP too. Here are the SL and TP for each currency: EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY, AUD/USD - SL=25 TP=60 GBP/USD - SL=33 TP=80 GBP/JPY - SL=66 TP=160 Lots size: Initial Entry = MLOT1 0,2 2nd Entry = MLOT2 0,4 3rd Entry = MLOT3 0,6 4th Entry = MLOT4 0,9 5th Entry = MLOT5 1,3 6th Entry = MLOT6 1,9 7th Entry = MLOT7 2,7 8th Entry = MLOT8 3,9 9th Entry = MLOT9 5,6 10th Entry = MLOT10 8 11th Entry = MLOT11 11,5 12th Entry = MLOT12 16,7 13th Entry = MLOT13 24 14th Entry = MLOT14 34,5 15th Entry = MLOT15 49 Note that the risk is higher but i think the system will close under the 10th entry. And i attached the statement from yesterday. The system is very nice, and i think the better session to get into this is the European cause it can go either way and you'll profit the same way. I'll continue testing, what do you guys think about this way? See ya

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi BGazzoni, There are many ways to play this. I have not looked at your calculations yet, but I am also testing some variations for shorter term trades using different parameters and smaller targets. I also believe that it is possible to Swing Trade this with something like a 25 Pip SL and a 100 Pip TP, but that is not really my style. I prefer mid to short term exposure to the Market whenever possible. What I can say is this. Having the ability to last 24 entries gives me greater comfort even though I do not really need to be able to last this number of levels. A comfortable Trader makes less mistakes. I encourage you to test any theories and let us know what you find. Still, good solid entries are the key. Just my opinions as alway.... Dan

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi BGazonni, How much capital reserve do you have in this example? By the 15th entry how much capital would you have at risk to lose? I believe your risk/reward (capital amount at risk/profit amount) would be extremely high by the 15th entry point. What if you needed to "bail-out" after the 15th entry point (i.e. approaching margin call), what would you do? Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi Walt, for this example you need $6,500 trading mini-account with 200:1. You are right about the risk/r been extremely high, but the higher SL and TP will take much more time to get fill, so it will open less trades (levels). And the bigger SL and TP will search for the trend and when it does i'll have a profit believe me. And to get to the 15th level the market must be in sideways for more than a week (I don't remember when this happened). The way i'm doing this settings is because i'm a swing trader and i really like to let the profits run (cause i believe the trend is my friend ) I didn't understand your last question, i'm sorry english is not my 1st language. Regards all. PS: Dan if you don't fell confortable with me putting my settings here let me know

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hey BGaz......You can share your settings here. No Problem at all. So long as we stick with the basic premise of the Strategy, new ideas are welcomed. The beauty of this Method is that it permits a high level of discretion and every Trader can modify to meet their own level of comfort. Personally, I have had good success with my settings and it fits my style of Trading. Others are free to do what they will. Dan

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Glad to hear that. I'll come back latter see ya

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi BGazzoni, How could you need only $6,500? Your 15th entry was 49 lots. Would you not need $12,250 at that point? Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I ran it again last night on the same pair, starting at 10 pm Central time. This time I let it run until it hit the TP of 40 pips. It went to the 7th level before it took off. I think I needed to time my entry a little better, I actually entered near the middle while it was ranging between 3 cycles (15 pip H/L).

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Jimbo.............7th Level is not really a concern to me. But do try and focus on your entries. Entering in the middle of a tight range is not the best. On a Standard Account using the 10/40 set-up the Aggregate Losses (DrawDown) were only -$170 when your SL was hit on the 6th entry. Your TP at the 7th Entry was $150. OVER AND ABOVE those aggregate losses, so the Risk Reward at that point is not bad, assuming that you are using my settings. Keep at it.... Dan

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Maybe it's better to enter after 10 bounces WOULD HAVE occured. You enter only after a reistance is exchausting over time.... Yes, I like that idea.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
tdion....Not sure what you mean by this. Can you clarify? Dan

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi Dan finally i can post due to technical problems. i follow your thread from the beginning and I must admitt I really like this style of trading. I found couple simillar systems but with different TP on other forums. System 10/10 - SL 10 and TP 10 looks good. One of the cons is that you can afford only for 10 entries. Your option with 40 pips TP looks even better. However on some pairs 40 pips may be to high. Lets take a look on eur/usd. You posted screenshot with eur/usd on one of your posts. As we can see ADR is 59 and IMO it's too small for our strategy. Pairs like gbp/usd usd/jpy seem to be ok, but we have to always check ADR. What I like in this method is that you don't have to be precisly with your entry and you don't need indicators to trade succesfully. You still got 24 entries to hit your TP. Now I wonder if you enter the market randomly, I still think that you got the chance to profit before 24-th entry. Before I read that you enter the market during special conditions (looking for support leveles etc.) my idea was simillar to what tidion wrote on post before. We have to find the pair where price was in the range 10 pips and still didn't hit 40 pips TP. For this 10 pip range we set up buy order - top of the range and sell order- bottom of the range. Lets say that the price was in this range and hit buy and sell 10 times. The next hit we enter the market. So now for us it will be 1-st entry but looking at the chart it will really be 11-th entry. This way we can go 34 entries before price will hit TP (10 entries before we entered market and 24 of ours). This is a good way for those wo are affraid that 24 entries can be not enough. Your idea with entering the market at important levels is very good, but I think you won't go further than 10 entires. In this method of MM: further you go-more money you can make. Once again this is a great system and I'll be keeping eye on it

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi Walt, as I said, it's a MINI-account and 200:1 leverage. So 1 lot you need $50 to open * 49 lots = $2450 than you add the drawdown and you get $6480. Hope this answer your question. Regards, Bruno

--- 帖子 #164 ---
4 trades in 3 days 3 of them close on the 1 first sequence 1 on the third Not very stressful for the moment . I love this system.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks, Bruno...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Gambler, How did you determine your appropriate entry points? thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hello DB07....Thanks for your comments. I agree with much of what you have said below. I added a few comments in RED below - also I just sent you an email: Dan

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I set Time entry option for Eur/usd to 7:44 (interbank time) check statement And for usd/Jpy I use break out ,trend line, fibo for the moment I only trade this two pair.I'm looking eur/jpy also (spread 4) But for this one I will modify tp and sl .

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Suppose you are not in the market. The price is bouncing back and forth within the range. After it bounces 10 times without hitting the Take Profit, you enter because you feel a breakout is nearing. The person that entered 10 bounces ago is in drawdown, while you have a fresh 24 (is that right?) bounces ahead of you. So in reality, the price would have to bounce a total of 34 times for a margin call, which is highly unlikely. In the said strategy, you are monitoring all pairs that have failed to hit take profits in their 10 first chances.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I get the idea......Sounds like a pretty good idea except that you may have trouble finding many entries. I do look for a set-up that is something like this. I believe that there are many options in regard to good entries. Dan

Hi, I have just download the EA. Some questions?? 1) If we used this on a live account, does that means we need to get the EA from Fxtrader each time it expires?? 2) Is is advisable to run on many pairs of currency?? I know the account must have enough margin to run.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thanks for sharing your idea and EA. Would it be possible to have a copy of the EA that does not expire? I personal would like to test it for a while and if all goes well then trade live starting with micro lots.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
i agree..not very interesting to spend time testing an expert that has an expiration date....

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Guys, I think what he is expressing here is the concept. He has laid that out completely.. If you really want an EA, write one. this is really a simple concept and very easy to code. I do not blame FXtraderpro for not wanting his EA bootlegged... He actually was quite generous in giving out the entire method in a very well laid out format. It is a little disingenuous to say otherwise of him... but then, some are still looking for the something for nothing pot of gold...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
hi, thanks for the system bro..... try on demo... using microlots today.... profitable i will demo it for nxweeks... ... i`m using barry support n resistance indi for entry

--- 帖子 #177 ---
so this system can be used on most currency pairs......... any rule regarding entry ? or just enter buy/sell randomly ? so after hitting TP, do i start all over again or just i profitable trade a day ?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
FXTRADEPRO, i think whatever u depend on for ur entry are totally "blind", there are no indicators can guarantee the entry. whatever the "indicators" been told are what the price told the indicators. i.e., u trade 365 times per day, and u still don't know which of them will terminate u (max 24 entrys), or let's say within 5 years. so why u r not trying to entry a new trade after ur win one by one? it gives u more opporunities to win and still remains the same risk. one lose will be make up by these # of trades. or r u willing to take another 1 year let's say to make up ur lost? think about it.

Hi, i used the ea for usd/jpy pair. i used the price entry option . I set a sell order at a certain price and select false for initial order long in your ea. the ea come out with the message ready for the next tick. But after the next tick is in place, it come out with the message, price is out of range and the order is disabled. Any idea what have went wrong? My timeframe is 15mins. Thanks

--- 帖子 #181 ---
but, the EA don't have the feature of entry a new buy/sell order after a win.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
FX, Thanks for posting this. I'll definitely help you test it further. Let me know if you would like me to post results...I will start Tonight when the market opens and run the EA at my own discretionary entry style. I think I have an idea of when to run the EA.............thanks again... P.S. What will happen if I set the EA to only take long's or short's? I'm thinking more along the lines of adding a 2nd level strategy feature in terms of hedging this method....

--- 帖子 #183 ---
chuthry......You should be using the Price Entry option when the place that you want to enter the Market is away from the current Market price. So let's say current market Price is 116.50 on USDJPY if you want to go Short at this price you would use the Immediate Entry option and set both Time Entry and Price Entry to FALSE. If you wanted to go short at let's say 116.70 (which is 20 pips above the current price in this example) you would set Price Entry to TRUE and enter 116.70 (+ the spread) and then set the EA on the chart. When the next tick occurs the EA will begin BUT you would get the message stating that New Orders are Disabled. That message will remain until the market reaches your specified Entry Price. When your price is reached the EA will place the first SELL Trade. The New Orders Disabled message will remain until the 2nd Entry Trade is opened. This is how the Expert works. I hope this helps.... Dan

--- 帖子 #184 ---
feeder2000............If you want the EA to automatically begin a new Sequence after a Take Profit Target is hit, then you would set the HIBERNATE Parameter to FALSE. I do not recommend Trading the Strategy that way, but when set to FALSE the EA will open a new Sequence right after closing the previous one, assuming that you entered originally using the Immediate Entry Option. If the Time Entry Option is used the EA would begin again once the SAME time originally set is reached. If the Price Entry Option is used the EA would begin again IF and when the same price level is reached. Dan

Hello X.Oden.........See my reply to you in RED below: Dan

Thank you all for the quick reply. There are only two broker available in our country. 1 is Plauskifx Foriegn Exchange, base in Delaware USA and the other is Performance Foriegn Exhange. They are both charging 10pipis spread plus $70 commission. Wanted to change my broker (plauskifx) but I really don't know how to do it. Doing Business with any broker located accross the sea sounds like a big PROBLEM to me, if some broblem occur with broker located abroad, It seems to me merely not possible to reach them. It will be a great help for newbie if some veteran member could enlighten me (not just for me but also for other member who are new to forex) on how to find a honest and trusted broker. IBFX is more preferred as it exactly uses GMT time. Sorry for the engglish grammar. Thanks, Rene

In determining entry points, Bollinger Bands might help. Wait for a constriction of bands to enter. Just a thought. Any back tests yet? Pippo

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hello Pippo........There are many different set-ups that can be effective and I am sure that some Traders work with B-bands. I have used them in my past Trading. Again the goal is to try and stay away from a tightly ranging Market and find a place and time when the Market is likely to move either 40 pips in our selected direction or 50 pips in the opposite direction. Regarding back-testing. I am not a believer in this practice. Besides, you cannot backtest an EA that had a discretionary entry. As I understand it (and I could be wrong here), backtesting is most suited to fully automated systems, which this is not. This is a Method.... Just my opinions as always... Dan

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yes, tightly ranging markets are to be avoided. We do not trade when BBs are tightly constricted. We might enter as price breaks out BBs when BB bandwidth&lt;.0015 at some critical price level. This could be tested. Just a thought.

Hi again Pippo.....YES, I am glad you understand. I encourage you to test this idea and let us know what works for you. Dan

Hello Traders............I see that the EA has been downloaded more than 240 times, yet only a few people have Posted any comments and questions. Let's hear from some new people who are trying this Strategy out. All are welcome. Dan

High Spread is a real account killer. I've observed a spread gone up to 10 pips and it pulled the account drawdown to 65.5 lots within a SECOND... It's only a Demo acct. And so the spread of GBP/USD is going up and down also. Extra careful of the Spread should be undertaken. Request: Would it be helpful to make the Spread text on the chart more bigger FONT? Thanks, Renefx

Hi Dan, I just ran across your system last night. I would like to thank you for posting it along with your great presentation. It is very clear and well written. I will be testing it out the next week or so. After which I should have some feedback. Thanks again, StrangeGuy

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Thanks StrangeGuy, Let me know if you need any assisatnce. Dan

--- 帖子 #216 ---
have u ever tried the reverse? Enter 0.5, then scale in until u reach 1 unit. AS for stop loss, use a scale out as the trend moves against u. So that 0.5 will become 0.3, then 0.2 then 0.1 until u reach a rock bottom.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Denmark, What do you mean by this? Can you give a sequential example against a specific pair. Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hello Dan, I like your EA and the strategy. Even Cramer (related to stocks) suggests a modified Martingale strategy, that he calls "wide scale" purchasing as the stock drops in value, but does not talk about purchase on the rise. While the EA works well when it is managing the trading, I am having a problem with the EA not trading past Level 13. A copy of my trading history is attached (fortunately in a demo account). In the history, you will notice that the trade stopped 3 times at that level (one completed successfully at that level and did not have to continue past Level 13). I should note that I am using an Interbank FX mini demo account, so I had to multiply the level values by 10. I admit I would pay to use an EA like this, especially if it were supported, but I also read the interchange about "selling" in this forum. However, I don't understand why this is a problem because I have seen other threads where EAs are being sold. Thanks! Leland

I really like this style of trading as a concept. What strategies like this boil down to is this: The market has to behave very specifically for the concept to lose money. As we all know algorithims change and the market can indeed behave very strangly and differently. My two cents is this: No EA can work without constant intervention. For whatever reason, the behavior of the Forex does not lend itself to patterns. Maybe ask the guys as MIT why but thats for another discussion. So the concept must be coupled with 1 or 2 indicators plus a "pull the plug" moment to save equity. I love the idea of averaging down, especially if the market is still favoring the original trade. I suggested this earlier and was nixed (which is fine, I trade on my own), but thought I would bring it up again. Also Candlestick patterns. The more I study the Forex the more I am convinced candlestick patterns are highly underestimated and probably the most powerful technical indicator out there. Just my two cents, but averaging down when the situation warrants plus the use of candlestick patterns are things I have successfully "demo'd" while I perfect my own strategies. I still will follow the post no matter which direction it takes though.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hello Mr. D, Not sure what you mean here exactly and how it can pertain to the Strategy. Can you clarify for me giving a specific example. I look forward to hearing from you on this. Dan

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Leland......It looks to me like you are trading on an IBFX Mini Account. That being the case, IBFX does not permit more than 50 Mini-Lots per "click", so the EA tries to enter anything over 50, but the server soes not accept it. If you look back as some previous Posts, this is discussed and I included some TABLES specifically detailing how to Trade my set-up on an IBFX Mini Account. I hope this helps.... Dan

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I think hes talking about averaging down until you get to 1 full lot moving against you. At that point use the reversal trade as the market by now is in a full fledge run against your original trade. I think thats it. Either that or place a smaller trade in the opposite direction and leave your original trade open, which saves on spread. Take the profit on the second trade and wait for price to move back toward the original.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hello Dan, That makes sense. Thanks for the quick reply. I'll either change to a standard account or try your "mini" modifications. Thanks! Leland

I thought the only money management system that should be traded on a situation with a positive expectaion is anti martingale ones. You are just waiting for small probability event to blow your account. Several such events in a row? Why not, if you wait long enought... Escalating risk to the height of tower of babylon doesnt look wise.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Alexander....I might agree with you if I was using a Random Entry, however, all Trading is about probabilities to my mind. With experience most can learn to avoid those situations where 24 losers in a row might occur. Also, this EA can be turned OFF at some point during the Sequence if one gets caught in a very tight range. It can later be turned ON again and it will pick up the Sequence where it left off. It is precisely the discretionary nature of the way I trade this method that makes it successful. Dan

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Ok, fair enough, let me play devil's advocate if you dont mind.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
That is true, however what we deal with in trading is with non predictive probabilites i.e. unlike in coin tossing situation we cant never know the probabilities.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
While I agree that we cannot predict direction or predict with 100% accuracy that a particular currency pair will cover it's Average Daily Range or even a portion of its ADR during a particular Trading Day, the fact is - we don't need to. The Strategy does enable us to use our discretion in an attempt to filter out those conditions that can make a Sequence Of Trades turn out badly. Further, we can stop a Sequence at any time if negative conditions persist. These are the things that help create the EDGE that every Trader needs. I Trade this successfully and perhaps I will eventually blow up an Account. At this point I would still be way ahead of the game if that did occur. Again, I appreciate your point of view and it should be noted and repeated that ALL Trading has RISK. Traders must be aware and accept that fact before using any System, Strategy or Method. Dan

I like to initiate the trade in the quite hours before the European Markets open for the EUR/USD and around 10 pm central time for USD/JPY. This has worked for me this past 2 weeks. I am 8 for 8 on my trades. The highest level I have gone to was Level 7.

hey FXTradepro, instead of 10/40 i'm trying 50/200 on eurjpy; and the lots start at .05 instead of .1. it has been 2 days only but in profit so far. when and where will you post the updated EA...considering sept is tomorrow? thnx

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Keep us posted criss on your EURJPY idea. The EA Posted on this Thread will not expire until October 5th, 2007. It is noted in the Post that contains the EA. I will Post new versions if interest continues. Dan

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Dan &amp; Others, How about expanding the SL &amp; TP, then close-out 50% of the lot size at the midpoint between entry price and SL. Once it reaches the SL, then close-out the remaing 50% position. For example, instead of a SL-10 &amp; TP-40 for EUR/USD, make it a SL-15 &amp; TP-60. If you entered 1 lot long at 1.3620, when it goes down to 1.3613, then close-out 0.5 lot. Once it gets to 1.3605, then close-out the remaining 0.5 lot and open a short (sell) position at 1.3605. Follow the same sequence if the short position goes against you. Do you think this will reduce the capital exposure risk relative to the rate/amount of return? thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Here's a statement if anyone is interested.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I would to start with the following anecdote: Two man were called: a statistician and a physicist. All were given 100k and a task of predicting a horse that comes first in horse racing. A stastician came with a sophisticated statistic model of the past history of horses, the condition of the track, the alignment of moon and start etc. The physicist said: « I had used your 100k to build a model, a perfect sphere representing a horse in vacuum.» Let me show you my perfect shpere in vacuum: Lets talk of the system generating entry signals for your system of martingale positioning. Lets forget about the martingale build up for now. Imagine this system's success rate (i.e. the percent of profitable trades) to be 99% (it might sound like science fiction but for the sake of argument it would do) hower you are not using anti-martingale money management (for example risking 2% of your account on each trade aka fixed fractional money management) therefore you are not letting geometric growth in the account to take place since you have a fixed entry lottage (0.1 lots in your examples). With one trade a day your catch is 40 bucks a day (trading EURUSD) which is almost 14k a year instead of several times more had you used anti-martingale money management. There is a little problem however, you cant sleep well, you can not entertain yourself with friends because of that one loosing trade out of hundred trades. The nighmares; we know, we can understand; the greed, the red eyes et cetera. You simply can not tolerate one loosing trade in a hundred. You therefore invent intra-galactic super-puper system based on martingale strategies (so popular in gambling world i wouldnt even have my name assosiated with it not to be ashamed). So here we have it, a 99% correct strategy, fixed risk on every trade even for such profitable strategy and a martingale strategy for 1 percent of wrong trades. You dont have to be rocket scientist to figure out that during that 1% of wrong trades you can go wrong. Very wrong. Eat up profit of many days trading you 99% correct stategy. Do you catch my drift? The only reason gamblers trade martingales is not because they want to change the odds, thats impossible, its because they have the negative expectation of the entry method, they want to take advatage, whatever it means, of streaks, therefore the only way to trade your martingale system is when you have inadeaquate entry system. Period. I had not talked of break even needed return because your strategy is essentialy day trading one and many, many, many pips are eaten up by spread.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Your statement about the 1 trade per day and $40 in profit is incorrect. If you review the TABLES provided earlier in this thread you will see that Profits increase as a Sequence Of Trades progresses. The Risk/Reward is considerably better than you imply. I appreciate you voicing your concerns, however, in doing so I think it would be helpful to fully understand the Strategy and concepts I have presented. Dan

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I did not say that. If you read carefuly i was discussing the entry system on its own, without the martingale build up. Later in the post however i added martingale for that 1 imaginary loosing trade in a 100.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I hope you didnt get the idea of me trying to destroy your system publicly, i just want to understand such methods in general and therefore present my ideas that i try to make logicaly sound, i might even throw in some maths to to generalize my argument. If i will find your system strong i would be the first one to trade it, so far however i did not see any proof that it is as profitable as you claim. Obviously until such proofs are presented it is very hard to fight even light-weight critisism of your system.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Alexander......I have presented a Strategy that I trade profitably and have no need or desire to prove my success to anyone. I merely share a concept that has worked well for me and ask Traders to decide for themselves if this is something that they would like to try. Every Trader will have different results from any Trading method and this is no different. I feel that this method of Trading has given me the edge I need to remain successful. I do not trade it blindly, and I understand and accept the risks. Anyone Trading Forex should do the same regardless of the method used. Dan

--- 帖子 #242 ---

This is correct. I suggest you study and read the entire thread. All you questions should be answered. Dan

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi Dan, Thanks again for sharing. After working with the system for a few short days I have found one thing I would like to see added. Personally, I would like to have an option to have the system stop once a certain MLOT number is reached. “Max MLOTs” defaulted to “24” if you like. If I had this option in the settings I would set it to 17. If trade of MLOT17 was not successful then I would want the EA to hibernate. I would manually control the trading of lots higher than this number once the market has stopped its ranging, large spreads or whatever has caused it to get to this point. I understand that your EA is designed to go all the way to 24 but please consider this modification in your next release. From my view point, it would enhance and add more flexibility for the trader to adapt the EA to his/her style and trading preference. Thanks, StrangeGuy

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi FXTradepro, I come to know of your thread just a few hours ago from another forum and have just completed reading all the 17 pages of posts. I will be downloading the EA and taking time to try out your strategy. From the presentation by you and your forward live tests , I want to thank you for sharing with all of us. Rgds/Tks Vincent

--- 帖子 #249 ---
StrangeGuy...........If you want the Sequence to stop at the 17th Level, just program a "0" for all the MLots after that in the EA External Parameters dialog box. You can also change the Lot Sizes in the Sequence if you like. I hope this helps..... Dan

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanks Vincent....You are very welcome. Dan

Dan, I am setting up a new demo account to test your strategy. Correct me if I am wrong.... I am using mini a/c of $3500.00 at 200:1 leverage, using 0.1 lot , trading 7 pairs. Right or wrong? Appreciate your answer. Tks Vincent

--- 帖子 #252 ---
As an ex-martingale roulette 'junky' (Saw another guy in this thread aswell) I'm obviously attracted to this system. Now let me just chime in with a few of my thoughts from a roulette Martingale POV, havent read the whole thread yet. - In roulette martingale there is 1 thing that will kill you long-term: The pesky little Zero on the wheel. What does this zero mean? The zero means Profit/Commission/Spread for the casino! - In roulette martingale there is 1 thing that limits your survival chance: Each table has a min/max bet amount. Now then how does this relate to forex? - Spread is the biggest killer of all-time in forex (get a 100% spread rebate and I guess all traders on this forum would be rich). Therefor I would suggest to not use this system with pairs that have a lower ADR:spread ratio then 35. Only EURJPY seems suitable for this system, since it's spread is only 2 and the ADR is 150-250. (that is if you use 10pip SL and 40pip TP). It would even better to trade Futures since then your spread is only 1pip. Do it on one of the indices futures; Dow up 100pnts = 400 price movements at .25pnts each and .25pnts spread =&gt; 400 ADR:Spread ratio. Now that's more like it (instead of ~40-50 for EurUSD spot forex). - In forex you can wager an 'unlimited' amount so this greatly ups your survival chance. However; Your semi-martingale system Improves in profit after each sequence, and this characteristic greatly reduces your survival chance. There is another characteristic of Forex vs. Roulette that will give you an advantage; For instance if you keep betting in 1 trend direction (like keep betting on Red in roulette) the next trade will have a Higher chance to succeed since trends are not sustained forever (people want to take profit or fresh buyers/sellers step in). In the contrary to Roulette in which your chance to succeed will remain a little less then 50%, for every single bet no matter the wheel gave 100% Black in the last 100spins. So I like your concept but I'm looking to change 2 things so it suits my trading/martingale experience; - Only bet in the direction of the trend &amp; keep betting at it using like; 1/2ADR TP and 1/5ADR SL. - Change the lot size increments so that it gives me the same profit for each Bet stage.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
FrankS, the zeros on the Roulette wheel will kill you whether you employ a martingale betting strategy or not. If there is one zero on the wheel, the house edge against you is 1/37 = 2.70%; if there are two zeros, the house edge against you is 2/38 = 5.26%. This expectancy does not change, no matter what betting system is applied: flat bets, martingale, anti-martingale, whatever. In mathematical terms, expectancy and MM operate completely independently of each other. The same necessarily applies to trading. You're correct in saying that costs (spread) have the same effect as the zero on the Roulette wheel, in that they make trading a negative expectancy game. Hence it's necessary to develop and implement a method of entries and exits that turns this expectancy around. Whatever betting (position sizing) is used is irrelevant, unless it can be shown that there is serial correlation between trades, i.e. that wins and losses are not distributed randomly. I suspect that traders turn to the martingale (or systems that progressively increase bet size) because they find it difficult to stomach losses, hence they want to return to breakeven as quickly as possible. These systems may work for a while, but escalating bet size increases risk in the sense these systems are less able to sustain a sequence of losses than flat betting (i.e. consistent position sizing). For example, at 2% flat bet size, it will take 50 losses to blow out an account. However, if one starts at 2% and (for example) doubles bet size following each losing trade, then the losses are 2%, 4%, 8%, 16%, etc, i.e. a sequence of only 6 losses will cause blowout. Even if bet size is escalated less drastically, the number of losses will still be less than with flat bet size. Starting bet size at (for example) 0.2% instead of 2% allows a larger number of losses, but it reduces win sizes by a factor of 10 in the same way as loss sizes are likewise reduced. With trading, I see two functions of position sizing: 1. Keep position sizes small , to preserve capital as long as possible, allowing the account to survive a sequence of losses long enough for a positive expectancy method to ultimately prevail. 2. Keep position sizes as consistent as possible. Obviously one doesn't want to be in the situation where (for example) one trade where 10% capital was risked, that happens to result in a loss, undo all the gains made by 5 winning trades, where only 2% was risked. I don't wish to seem a big-head know-it-all, but I believe that these mathematical truisms are self-evident, and apply in any activity whose outcomes involve uncertainty. I respectfully challenge anybody to choose any betting system they wish, and provide a mathematical proof as to how it can improve (or otherwise alter) expectancy. David

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Here's a thought...If you do not like the system... DO NOT trade it and move on! I am 9 for 9 as of this morning using this system. Last night's trade was the EUR/USD and it went to level 6 before hitting the TP. Pocketed $130. Enough said.....

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Which Broker are you set-up with? The above does not sound 100% correct but let me know. Dan

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Dan, Broker is Fastbrokers. Pip value is $1 for a 0.1lot. Vincent

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Vincent......Here is the TABLE for use with a Mini-Account 200:1 leverage. You will require MICRO Lots to trade the full Sequence on a Mini Account, meaning 0.01 = $0.10. I don't know if Fastbrokers permits this, but you should ask them. The last column on the Right tells you how much funds you need to Trade the Strategy as I have outlined in this Thread. For example, you will need $6,390. to Trade to the 24th Level and you Trade only 1 pair at a time with this amount of funds. I hope you understand better now. Good Trading!

Does anyone know the best way to protect against the drawdowns as one moves through the progressions. Perhaps there's a way to scalp from the ranging action with a high degree of direction certainty, or enter 10 pip TP going in the opposite direction... Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Dan, Great thread! thanks for all the time you have put in! Do you have a percentage breakdown of each level that a target is hit. For example; how many trades close at level 1, level 2 etc.... Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hello JRSW........Welcome to the Thread! I am sorry but I have not calculated the percentages you ask for. Remember that the Entry Criteria used is very subjective so everyone will have different results. Having said that, MOST of my Sequences close before the 10th Entry but I have had many go longer and 1 that went as high as 20. When re-evaluating the ones that went to a high number of Entries I have learned that many times I should have waited to start my Sequence until more volatile conditions were present. I hope this helps you. Dan

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Dan, Okay, I understand. I will check with Fastbrokers on the 0.01 lot. Thanks Vincent

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Please evaluate the merits of this strategy as a way to reduce the impact of drawdowns (i.e. $31k blowout)... What if I were to enter into a short position with a TP of 10 pips and a long position with a TP of 10 pips, each with a SL of 25 pips. This would occur simultaneously with the FXTradepro EA. The idea is to profit from the retracements (ranging action) and offset the loses from the stop &amp; reverse of each progression. Once the TP occurs, I would then open a position to replace the closed one. It would be great if I had an EA for this process. Is there anyone who can write such an EA? Your thoughts... thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #263 ---
you know david smith

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Just a quick note to thank you, Dan, for posting this Strategy. I just found the link yesterday and have completed reading all the posts. Whew! Lots of folks have lots of ideas, but for now, I'm going to stick with the originator on this one. Learned a long time ago that the franshisor has a lot more experience with his product than the franshisee! This one looks like a "Keeper" May the Forex be with you all, Joe M.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
dan, is there any way we can lower the take profit and still come out on top even if we get deep into a sequence?? i think i may have a solution for everyone, im very experienced with martingale systems...see if we can change the take profit from 40 to either 20 or 30 at least, i havent done the math yet to see if it works mathematically yet, we may have to lower the number of entries from 24 to something a little lower, let me know.....

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I know about him... I don't know him personally. thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #267 ---
dan, will this work mathematically?? sequence, .01 initial entry .01 .02 .03 .05 .08 .13 .21 .34 .55 .89 1.44 2.33 3.77 6.10 with a 10 pip stop loss and a 20 pip take profit??if it doesnt, using this sequence, what the lowest take profit we can use that will work?? if it does i have an excellent suggestion to make this real safe....

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi Tiago, I believe the FXTradepro calculator can be downloaded and used with your suggested parameters to determine the outcome. The attachment is located in an earlier post from Dan. thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #269 ---
This is a FIB Sequence which can work with a 10 Pip SL and TP of 20. As Walter suggested, please download the FXTradepro Manager CALCULATOR from a previous Post and you can see how these settings work out. Then, please come back and share your ideas.... Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Walt, I have played with your idea on my Dans model, and plugged it into my failure calculation model for these progression sequences. Unfortunately the failure calc model does not deal with TP's that are smaller than SL's, this is becvause the progression sequences just don't work out for a martingale style progression with the variables set in this fashion. However on hte progression model I was able to play it out to about 5 progression sequences - and condisering that the SL is greater than the TP - then your failure rate (upon random entry) will likely be very low (with a 5 prog sequence). Tim

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Joe, Just a comment on your belief surrounding this system. I agree that the owner usually has the upper hand when it comes to the knowledge of there own system. However in this case Dans knowledge is not so much in his EA and his progression model - as in his skill at entering the market at a reasonable position to obtain enough volatility to ensure he gets a good level close out in profit on his progression. The EA merely gives him "room" to be wrong. He uses it as a tool not a system in itself!!! So if you are suggesting to just trade with his progression don't think that you are acting in a safe manner - unless you get some teaching from Dan as to exactly how he enters the market. Otherwise I would suggest you work out your own progression based on the associated risk that is relavant to YOUR entry technique. Beginners beware with Martingale (Joe I am not suggesting you are a beginner). This is a first rate tool, but without understanding how to apply it - could be very dangerous to your bank balance. See Dans private forum for more indepth mathematical analysis of the risks Tim

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Tim, Well said. Vincent

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Excellent Post Tim......You input is always appreciated. Dan

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi tiago, Go look at Dans private forum - we have been playing with the variables for a while on that forum. The risk model I have loaded up on that forum will show you exactly the likely failure you will get depending on what variables you plug in. I can tell you now that varying the SL has the most significant impact. Obviously the three variables being the SL, TP, and the No. of progressions. The size of trades per progression also effects the net profitability of the sequence (but not the definative risk). Tim

--- 帖子 #275 ---
HI tiago, I have calculated your progression models risk (based on a random entry) as 1 failure per 5364 trades of the system (EA). (Based on the Euro/USD since it has the smallest spread). I took the liberty of extending your sequnce out to the 19th prog level - beyond this the numbers go crazy. This is a very good risk compared to Dans original progression sequence of 1:159 (assuming a random entry). But of course Dan's skill lies in the way he enters the market initially and so it is not random. However, although your progression runs less risk it also produces far less average profit. $221 per trade on average compared to Dans $632 (again assuming Dans entry to be random to achieve the average across his progression). The other point I will make about your progression is that (paradoxically) if you attempt to enter the market with a system that is reasonably accurate at picking the direction, and much more importantly for a Marty progression sequence - the increased market volatility, then you will do much worse than the average of $221. You will only achieve this average on using a random entry. The reason for this is the fact that your first ~10 levels of the progression produce very poor profits compared to Dans. At the end of the day - the progression you propose will do nicely over the long term as it will drift to the average profit when given enough trades. So your real ROI on random entry will be a very reasonable 227% (assuming one trade per day 220 day per year traded). And your failure chance trading this often will be 1 "blowout" per 24.4 years. I am sure that there will be many people who could live with that. However I think there are much better progression sequences IMO. See Dans private forum for some further ideas. Tim

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi Tim, I appreciate your response. Please understand that my intent is to simultaneously trade the FXTradepro semi-marty system with the TP - 10 pips &amp; SL - 30 pips as a hedge against the drawdowns for each progression. Also, I probably would not use a marty style for the hedge against the drawdowns. Instead, I would enter two 1 lot entries (1 long &amp; 1 short). Once each hedge closes, I would continue to open a new one for the given direction (long or short) that closed out. Hopefully this makes sense... your thoughts... Thanks, Walt

Hi all.........Yesterday, this thread had a 5 Star Rating (ever since the Thread began) and today it's gone! I wonder what happened. Does anyone know how that works? Dan

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Tim, I agree that just trading the progression is a risky proposition indeed, (see my GBP/JPY example below) but the entry method is very plainly given in the previous posts of setting up resistance and support levels and buying and selling accordingly. That followed by the suggested SL and TP levels Dan has tested and has proven over time to be the optimal settings makes this a pretty solid trading technique. To follow what someone has already tested through a great deal of time and money deserves to be heeded. A lot of folks want to put their 'spin' on something that is already working very well. Yes, this system lends itself to flexibility, and we are all able to change it accordingly. My point is that for me, I will follow what has been laid out by the originator for the time being. As I get more familiar with the nuances of the strategy, maybe then I will venture out into the unknown realms. Following blindly indeed soes not work, for example, I opened a GBP/JPY trade last night thinking that a 400:1 ratio would cover any contengencies, but much to my surprise when I looked at it this morning, the profit had vanished and my trading account had been reduced to a steaming pile of dog doo! Fortunately, it is only a demo account! So the point being, a good entry at the proper time of day will make this strategy work, but it seems that poor timing is a bit risky. The good part about this system is that one doesn't have to be right about the direction of the first trade. It seems that often times it works out anyway. Best of luck, and may the Forex be with you all! Joe M.

hey tim, ive been trading forex for 8 years and i consider myself a professional full-time trader, i have come up with a beautiful martingale system that actually does great in all market conditions...the reason for this is i have a custom indicator that is so beautifully accurate and i use it on a 1 minute timeframe, the results of this indicator are literally incredible and it doesnt repaint...using this indicator one could easily determine market direction for each independent sequence, i use this indicator right now with my grid and its producing a phenominal amount of money on my live trading accounts....the only thing is i dont know how to code, hopefully in dan's private forum there is someone that knows how to code and we can produce something special, let me know......tiago

tiago.....Why not share the Indicator. I would love to see what you have. Regards, Dan

I went back and looked through the thread log and there is not anything unusual. I remember this happened about a year ago to another thread. Never figured out what caused it... I recast my 5 star rating and the system accepted it. That means somehow it lost the totals... So could eveyone who voted, please just revote? Not sure what else to do... That seemed to work on the other thread.

Any suggestions on hedge trades to offset the loss on each progression? Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #287 ---
How would a hedge trade offest the loss? Or do you mean taking out a position in a basket of curencies? If you mean just buying and selling the same currency, you are just prolonging the pain. and eating up margin and paying for your broker's kid's college fund.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
The hedge idea is to take advantage of the retracements that occur with the FXTradepro semi-martingale S&amp;R strategy. Simply scalping 5 - 10 pips during each progression. For example, if the FXTradepro initial entry is long, we understand that the SL = 10 &amp; TP = 40, based on Dan's posts. Often times the trades will S&amp;R through 7 -10 progressions or more. My idea is to take the opposite position of each progression. Therefore, if the progression loses 10 pips, then the hedged trade will gain 10 pips. I would set the hedged trade as follows: SL - 20 &amp; TP - 10 or SL - 25 &amp; TP - 15... always in the opposite position to the the FXTradepro marty position. Your thoughts... Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I'm trying to mitigate the devasting impact of a massive blowout drawdown if a trade goes beyond 24 progressions... I'm open to any better suggestions... Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #290 ---
jones, one way to successfully do it is to have a great indicator on the shortest time frame possible with high inputs in order to capture huge moves very quickly......you can also use this concept for a grid strategy successfully by placing only longs when the indicator is UP and switching to only SHORTS when the indicator is down.......think about it...

I trade exactly using Don method on GU, UJ and EJ pair Just find the best time to enter. Start on 4 Sept until 6 Sept Close Profit $101,1 I'm using IBFX strandart_mini_micro account The result so far so good. Thanks don for sharing this method. PS: I rate again the 5 star

Thanks duyduy..........I am glad you joined us. Dan

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I just don't see it. That is still trading on hope. eventually you will have to close out one side or the other and the the big loss is still there, plus all the extra broker costs. What if the market does not ocsillate as you are hoping for with the hedge? Further, why trade this approach in the first place if you filter out the only way it can be profitable and that is by having a move in the market at the correct time and in the correct direction.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I agree with Scott on this point........ Dan

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Walt, I think the only logical way to mitigate the impact of the blowout is this: Assuming that you enter the market at a certain time when volatility is high, take your setup and slip it into 5 positions. So for example if your progression called for a base capital requirement of $30,000, then you would split this into 5 trades the same progression sequence - but scaled down - with $6,000 base capital each. Now you then set the price entry to spread the entries say ~10 pips apart, ranging from the first entry point for the first progression. This will mean that you will effectively have a very high likelihood of only one in 5 of the progressions blowing out (if any at all), and there is virtually no chance the broker can play with the numbers to catch your worst case scenario...especially with 5 seperate progression sequences operating at once at different price points. (I guess you'd have to run 5 platforms and point them all at your same live account so you can run 5 EA's ...but if you want the safty - it would be well worth it.) Tim

So how did everybody do last week trying out the Strategy? Let's keep the discussion going folks.... Dan

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Would like to post my results from trading last week. It was my first week using the strategy, I was very happy to see it work so well. In addition to GBPUSD, I tried a couple of different pairs, namely the EURJPY and the GBPJPY. While the volatility is excellent, I found that the times of lower volatility and smaller swings were devastating to an underfunded account. So I did a bit more research with the spreadsheet program, re-allocated the lot sizes to reflect the leverage and account size and voilà! The blowouts have not returned. On my account where I'm running GBPUSD IBFX STD MINI Setup, did quite well, even through the non-farm announcement on Friday. So even with IBEX widening the spread, as is their habit during non-farm announcement, FXTradePro Manager is working to perfection. At this rate, I will be comfortable enough to trade with my live account in a week or so. Hope this helps the group. Thanks again, Dan for sharing this with us. Joe M.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hello Joe M.......I am glad you are enjoying the Strategy. Always trade carefully to try and stay away from those quiet ranging periods. Dan

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hello Everyone...........Just closed a profitable Sequence on GBPUSD that I set to open SHORT at 2.0314 last night at 10 PM EST. The Sequence closed at the 7th Entry at around 11 AM today for $150. profit. Here is the Chart..... http://aycu10.webshots.com/image/256...8746412_rs.jpg Good Trading to All !!! Dan

--- 帖子 #300 ---
As of this moment, the FXTradepro Manager EA has been downloaded 391 times, yet only a handful of Traders have commented on its use. Come on folks....Let's hear what you have been doing with this tool. Thanks all, Dan

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Dan, Have you tried turning off the hibernation mode on the JPY crosses and let it trade for the week and close up shop on Friday? If so, can you please share your experiences? Also, what are your intentions for the FF members after the EA expires on 9/24? Thanks, lcfxtrader

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I have stated many times that I do NOT run the EA with Hibernate set to FALSE. It is, in my opinion, much too risky and I prefer to maintain control of my Initial Entry in the Sequence. This Tool was never really designed to be fully automated and I trade it as such. Regarding the EA, I will continue to Post updated versions as long as there is a reasonable amount of interest from Factory Members. It will also be available at the Private Forum (of which you are a Member lcfxtrader). By the way, the current EA expires on October 5th at 00:00 (Broker Server Time) and not on September 24th. Regards, Dan

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi Dan, I think the traders are busy making money with your EA so that's the reason why they don't have time to post :-) The key to this EA is to have a decent entry or as good entry as possible. Users are trying to figure out the entry. Finding a good entry is not easy. One false move and then get caught in a range can increase the progression level quite high which lead to large drawdown. Thus, good entry is crucial to be successful with this EA. Perhaps, someone can post with method or technique to find good entry (it doesn't have to be the absolute best which is impossible). [/i]

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I'm focusing on the timing of my entry. Trying to determine the appropriate price point and direction is virtually impossible. Correct me if I'm wrong Dan, but I understand that this impossibility is the basis of why you developed this system. Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I have determined that it would be too risky to go past the 15th or 16th progression. Also, for the 1st 4 progressions I enter at 0.01 pips. By the 15th progression I'm only risking 5.4% of my capital. Furthermore, the capital requirement is only $31.9k, as opposed to $47.5k by entering the first 4 progessions at 0.01 pips each. Even with a "blowout" as much as 5% of the time, this would still be very profitable... and I would sleep easier at night knowing only $1,582 is at risk (15 progressions) for a total drawdown vs. having a potential drawdown of more than $31k. Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Based on the London market's volatility, I believe entering at or after 11:00 PM (EST) will ensure a breakout before a blowout, providing that no major news is being released during the trade sequences. I'll let you know how this turns out... Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi there, You are not alone making money on this stuff, I have friends who trade a far riskier model with dynamically changing TP and SL settings, and there is only one problem with all these systems: depending on how fast you accelerate the lot increases, you may face closed margins sooner than regained losses. It only takes ONE sequence-of-failed-trades to bring this sort of system down, and it can eat away the money you've made over several months in one day. But stop and reverse (as you are using it) on discretionary entries is going to put the odds in your favor. My suggestion is to make all the entries and exits discretionary, even if you do a stop-reverse yourself. This would then mean that you are trading normally with the hope of not getting 15 losses in a row, and making up some losses on the way. Best of luck, -P

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi Walt...........My comments are below: Dan

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hello Plutonite..............Thanks for dropping in. Yes, there are risks, however, I agree and have been successful using a discretionary entry for the Initial Entry in the Sequence. Regarding using a MANUAL approach - It is possible to trade it that way, however, the EA enables us to get away from the Trade Terminal as sometimes these Trades take some time to mature. Thanks for the input. Dan

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Dan, Sorry, I've got not much to report for last week's trades because I started off with the incorrect lot size and I witness the terminal's journal showing "not enough money" when the progression reached level 16. I have since learned and now demoing with fresh account. I also would like to take this opportunity to thank Dan for sharing this fantastic method with all of us. Vincent

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I agree... this is an AWESOME system that is fundamentally simply and practical. It's based on the most critical aspect of trading - Price Action. Kudos to you Dan for your time and effort in sharing this system. I believe that with good Money Management this system is an almost can't miss! Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hey Vincent and Walt............Thanks for the kind words. I am grateful for my success and happy to share. Trade carefully and you will succeed as well. Please feel free to Post at the Private Forum as well. Dan

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi EATrader......Yes, unlike many other Strategies, with this the TIME/PLACE of the Initial Entry is paramount. However, having the ability to trade to 24 Levels really puts the odds in our favor, I believe. I am a big fan of using Support and Resistance area's as GENERALLY one of 2 things happen at these levels. Either price will break through the S/R area or price will retrace. Try locating these area's on a 30 Minute or 1 Hour Chart and see what happens at these important levels. Also, a neat little trick that we can use if we get caught too long in a tight range and begin to feel uncomfortable is to TOGGLE the EA off on the MT4 Platform (do not remove the EA) and then we can turn it back ON when the market starts to move out of the range. The EA will pick the Sequence up where it left off at that point. I hope this is useful to you! Dan

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi FXTradepro, I have one suggestion for your EA - why don't you use Buy/Sell Stop orders for the reverse direction. For example if you enter Long on 2.0210 put a Short Sell Stop order on 2.0200. If you use only market orders and the market goes fast you might miss some pips before you get in a trade. P.S. Geat system by the way

--- 帖子 #315 ---
FXTradepro, so you're getting 40 pips profit every day ? i've never played with gbp/usd before so very ignorant........ so how much would i be risking on the very 1st trade......... mmmm.........if i start small...it's safer but the profit is less........unless there's always more than 1 profitable trade per day ?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi findcount.........Pretty much everything is spelled out here. Generally, I take at LEAST 1 Trade per day but I wouldn't characterize it as a "40 pips profit every day" because the Strategy accounts for larger gains dollar-wise as the Sequence continues. Review the Thread carefully and you will see that this has all been discussed. Dan

--- 帖子 #317 ---
hey fxtradepro, playing with your EA for 2 weeks now i find, as you trade it, the best entry is around S&amp;R areas and the opening of the EURO markets. thank you for your contribution and simplicity of the EA!

Hello everybody, hello fxtraderpro, i like your strategy, and forward testing it w 4 pairs (low spread, default setup). I think that a breakeven in place of tp could be more profitable (why exit a trade if it's a winner). The BE could have an increment (let's say 5 pips). Anyway it's a good strategy and i thank you for sharing it.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I forward test it for 2 weeks now. This is the 1st time happened..

Please post a screen shot of your chart with the EA in place. Do you have a smiley face in the upper right hand corner?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
My biggest problem with this system so far is that it is TOO SUCCESSFUL!!! I usually hit my TP by the 2nd or 3rd progression. Even if it advanced to the 4th progresson, such nightly returns will only yield a 21% return against a capital reserve of $47.5k. However, if my capital reserve is only $11.3K, then my effective annual return is 88%, assuming that I go fund only to 18 progressions and don't experience a blowout. thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Imagine TOO Successful, LOL.....Walt, what are you basing your entry criteria on? And also, what Pairs are you trading? Dan

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Thanks for this strategy! I had a look at the Cable and it looks very promising if you use a good entry. BTW: I did not download your EA but just wanted to say hello. I don't use MT4 in combination with EA's, I do it all manually. Regards - Xaron

Hi Dan, I'm mostly trading GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY. Walt

thank for your offer to help i figured it out i just need to learn mt4

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi Walt, GBP/JPY &amp; EUR/JPY have been in range for this week so SL has been hit quite often, how high does your progression level reach to (Mine got up to 15)? What do you base your entry on? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi dan excellent presentation and strategy.have been demoing the EA for a couple of days-very good results.thanks for sharing kanis uk

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hello Plutonite......Can you please elaborate on the above idea? Why do you think that trading this concept manually would be beneficial? Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #336 ---
As a matter of fact last night my TP was reached on the GBPJPY on the 1st progression (SL-24, TP-100); however, I also traded GBPUSD, which reach my TP on the 17th progression (SL-12, TP-50). Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Nicely traded on GBPJPY......GBPUSD was caught in a pretty tight range last night. The safety of a 24 entry Sequence is what helps in situations like that. At 17 Entries, your profit should have been pretty good. Dan

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Absolutely... Just think, I was considering reducing my trades to only 15 progressions. I'm considering the probability of a shorter ratio than 1:4. Perhaps 1:2.5 would create breakouts much sooner, depending on the currency pair. For example, GBPUSD needed to exceed a range of 50 pips (actually my SL was 12 &amp; my TP was 50... so I needed 62 pips). However, at a ratio of 1:2.5, having a SL of 10 would demand a TP of 25. This would have resulted in a breakout by the 10th progression instead of the 17 progression. The problem is that the margin requirement would increase materially. Walt

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Walt.....As a long time user of this Method, I have tried many different combinations and parameters. What you say above is correct and Traders can decide what settings are best for them. I probably have tried them all and settled on the settings I have provided in this Thread but other combinations can also work. Dan

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thanks for this contribution FxTraderPro, I am testing your EA with good results with microlots in IBFX (10 positions opened until now= 100% gained) but I would like to ask you some questions: - In IBFX the spread in GBP/JPY is 9 or 10 pips, so if I want to trade this pair I can't: as soon as it opens the position is closed. - Can you tell me the calculations if I want to change the settings from the defaults SL 10 and TP 40 to this one: SL: 20 TP: 50 . Or what do you think that would be the best TP and calculations with 20 SL? I would thank you a lot if you can tell me these calculations in standard account, minilots and microlots. You can do it by PM if you want. I also saw that it works with more than 1 pair at once. Keep on this wonderful thread and congratulations

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Your Very Welcome Joselb......Regarding calculations for GBPJPY - I don't trade this pair BUT in order to us the EA with the Lot Sizing I use, you would need a TP of 80 with a 20 Pips SL. You can recalculate Lot Sizing yourself using any combination of settings by downloading and using the FXTradepro Manager Calculator found in Post #116. Let me know if you have any further questions. Dan

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thanks for your fast answer and your help Dan

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Great that you use openoffice too Only one question: I change the leverage, SL and/or TP in this calculator but the lots are the same: 0,01... , must they be changed in some manner?. I thought that changing the SL or TP the lots would be different to gain in the next lot what you lost before in a bad trade. Thanks again Dan.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
If you modify the SL and TP and Leverage settings you must then "play" with the Lot Size Calculations (in the gold fields) to figure out settings that are appropriate. Just give it a try and things should become clear to you. Dan

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Ok, I understand it now Today 3 more trades gained with IBFX microlots: eur/jpy, gbp/usd and usd/jpy I think that opening a position with these pairs half an hour before and after the opening of London Market works because as you know there is so much volatility in that hour

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi Joselb, Just thought I'd stick my nose in on your discussion with Dan about what parameters to trade using GBP/JPY. Here is a statistical analysis of your options based on what you guys are hatching for a progression plan: [Note: these probabilities are based on a RANDOM entry pattern. Of course you are not going to entry randomly so you won't run this level of risk, and so if you run a smart entry method you will probably improve your chances of success - like Dan does for his progression. HOWEVER these probabilities are very useful to compare since if you trade using them with an identical entry method then the failure probabilites are definitely comparable .] Dan suggested you look at using SL = 20, TP = 80, and (presumably) 24 progression levels, trading GBP/JPY (assuming a 9 pip spread). Your failure probability will be 1:35 Dans progression runs a ( random ) entry failure probability of 1:66 (assuming Dan runs it on Euro/USD). So effectively Dan backs his trading experience for his entry method and runs an "insurance policy" that gives him many more chances of being right - at the end of the day. Hence compared to Dans progression you would be running nearly twice the risk if you traded both progressions with an identical entry method . Just a note: A progression set up with a SL = 12, TP = 39, Prog levels = 21 (and a max lot usage out to ~45-50 lots), trading the Euro/USD with a 2 pip spread, will give you a failure probability of 1:98 and a profit per year of about 100% return depending on how you set out the lots to be traded on each progression. (Also assumes for comparative analysis that you would trade the EA once per day 250 days of the year). So this is significantly less risky than Dans progression - assuming once again that you traded the progressions with an identical entry method (be it Dans or otherwise). But of course the above progression setup would produce much less profit over a year than Dans ... but I could live with 100% p.a. and a lot less risk (assuming I can come up with a good entry method). Conclusion: 1/ Don't be fooled into thinking that just because GBP/JPY offers greater volatility, that it will more likely get to the TP, it won't. You will end up with comparitively more risk to achieve the same profit compared to trading Euro/USD. (Trading the Euro/USD just seems more risky sometimes because you are often sitting in a trade for a lot longer because it is slow to get to the TP....) 2/ Any pair with a spread over 2 starts gearing much higher risk (based on a random start point), relative to low spread pairs. 3/ The variation of Stop Loss has considerably more impact on your probability of failure compared to the variation of the TP. So the greater the SL the better (ie lower failure probability) ... but of course this comes at a price since the Tp and/or lots traded (which translates into the number of progression levels) will have to be altered ...which will impact on profit.... 4/ Dans progression calculation spreadsheet is very good - since it forces you to carefully balance all the variables - and you can't "cheat". It will always produce a relative balance between profit and risk that you cannot escape. So be careful about trading the higher volatile pairs. After all by their very nature this is why brokers give them such large spreads . I do not believe there is any advantage in trading them using this type of EA, only greater risk. Tim

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thanks for your calculations and your effort timmy although I must tell you my opinion about it and it's that I think that it's almost impossible to predict with 100% accuracy this percentage, but you can be right in a good percentage. I think that FxTradePro's calculations with SL 10 and TP 40 (and no more than 5 spread in the pairs to trade) are great and I am sure that he tested it during 1 year before sharing with all of us. And I agree with you that gbp/jpy is not good because I am risking a lot with that 9 or 10 spread. In fact I decided not to trade this pair with this EA and moving instead to eur/jpy (4 pips spread and high movements). I am testing now gbp/usd, usd/jpy and eur/jpy. I hate the slow movement of eur/usd and the few volatility in this pair but I agree with you that it's a more stable pair with only 2 pips spread Thanks timmy.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Your weolcome joselb. ......And sure, probabilities are only that - probabilities. You can have that failure tomorrow or you could have it in 3 years time - but you will have one at some time with this type of system (and don't get me wrong I love these type of systems). The trick too it is that our entry technique allows us a much greater chance of not having one for a long time (and we have made a nice fat profit by the time we do). So I'd rather take a progression with a lower chance of failure and mix that in with a good entry system, than one with a higher chance of failure and the same entry system.... but that is just my preference. And I agree we cannot predict these things to 100% accuracy - that was not what I was attempting to do. I was giving you the simple comparitive probability of failure with the various progression setups we each have been looking at. It is not about calculating that you will have a failure precisely every 66 or 98 trades... it is merely a comparison so you have a basis to work off. Obviously we don't trade in a perfectly functioning market - especially not with the brokers we have to deal with on a day to day basis. I think once you add your entry method - and as long as this method is consistant, you can use the probabilities to give a general comparitive guideline. If Dans entry technique is good enough - which it seems to be from what he has stated to date - then it is simply a matter of tactical choice whether he trades it with a risky, high profit progression, or a low risk, lower profit progression. And just because Dans progression set up has worked for him for a year or more, that does not mean it will be "safe" for you or me to trade it - since it is the entry technique that he uses that makes it much more safe.... To trade it as efficiently as Dan you need to trade it precisely the way he does, or come up with your own smart entry system. So I think having an understanding of the risks we choose to operate this excellent EA with is very useful in that we can start by removing progression setups that are simply too risky for our taste, or not profitable enough, or likely to take too long to complete etc etc, and then we can forward test appropriately.

I'm new to this thread, I've not read every post so my apologies if this has already been discussed. Has a D'Alembert progression been considered?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi FXTradepro, Thanks for your excellent posts and technique. I am searching and trying out some similar Martigale methods. My main focus is to reduce the number of progression and lot size. I like your progression most so far. One of the ways, as some one here mentioned, is to trade only one direction, for example, ONLY BUY LONG, when price go down just cut loss and wait for buying long signal to appear and buy long again. In this case you can sustain longer price fluctuation with the same amount of fund. See example below, it use FIB progress with basic lot size of 15000 units(Interactive Brokers). I am using smartquant. May be I should try MT4 brokers to play micro lot for experiement. How can I get your EA source code so that I can modify to add new features to make it more robust?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Did you use the progression you described on thread # 319?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hello TickJob.....Trading this in 1 direction is really a completely different concept to what I am doing. One of the main concepts presented here is that we assume that we cannot predict the Markets direction with any certainty (in the short term). Trading in 1 direction assumes the opposite...... Dan

--- 帖子 #353 ---
No, I used 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... I will be trying #319 progression.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Actually with direction or no direction the concepts are still the same when come to this martigale thing because both are assuming that we are likely to be wrong in guessing, and so we need to so many progression. Hence, the key thing is to be able to sustain as long price fluctuation as possible

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Yes. I do agree with you here in some respects, however, Trading this in just 1 direction means that eventually you need to have been correct on that Initial direction. For my Method it's great if our direction is correct BUT if we get a break the other way we are still going to be profitable. Dan

Hello Everyone......It seems very quiet on this Thread the past few days, yet, almost 500 people have downloaded the Expert. Let's hear from some new people trying the Strategy......Or is everyone losing interest? Dan

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Not losing interest...just being quite... Had a winner on the GBP/USD last night. Started the EA up around 10 pm last night and it closed out at the 5th level ($90+), after the London market opened up. Did not really look too close at it before I left for work, but it just checked to se if it closed over night. Pretty steady program that works out for me each day.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Dan, I don't think it's a matter of losing interest, but rather a issue of risk &amp; reward. This is an excellent system with only two potential downsides. Most other systems have numerous downsides. The only two issues ("downsides") are: (1) if a breakout occurs within the first 7 progressions, there's not a lot of money to be made... as compared to other systems and strategies for a night's effort; (2) this system forces one to contemplate the probability of a drawndown of 50% of your capital reserves (i.e. Margin Requirement). Although the odds are that it will not happen with proper entry, and one could have 24 consecutive losses with other systems (which would create a similar cummulative drawdown impact), this system forces one to acknowledge this fact up front. If there was a way to emphasize the ROI of this system and offset the drawdown impact through the progressions, I believe this would be the most popular and powerful thread on this site... IMHO... Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Walt....You are correct, and if you ever figure out that issue you will certainly have found the Holy Grail. It does not exist unfortunately. Also,for some very odd reason there are a very large number of people drawn to Forex because they think they can get rich with a Small Bank Account and very little risk. IMHO, this is not the case, at least not for me personally. Gains in this Strategy can be both large AND small, however, the average can be quite respectable when Traded over a period of time. My comments earlier about not so many people participating in the discussion is simply because such a large number of EA's have been downloaded and I assume that many more are trying the Strategy out. It would be nice to hear from some of them... Always appreciate your comments Walt. Dan

which pair will work better than gbp/usd ? will gbp/jpy be more 'trendy' with less whipsaws work better ?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I use EUR/JPY only at the moment. The spread for GBP/JPY is too big for me using the standard settings of 10/40. BTW: GBP/USD works great, too. It depends on the entry. Don't ever use a random one! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #364 ---
FXTradePro: I have been thinking long and hard about this strategy, and have come to some conclusions. I think this thread is the best place to post the idea: It is common sense that drawdown is the killer in this strategy. So how can we eliminate drawdown? Very simple. Place orders within a few pips of each other. Now before you grimmace, think about this for a minute. Suppose you start with 0.1 lots...... EUR 1.3305 L 0.1 EUR 1.3303 S 0.2 EUR 1.3305 L 0.2 EUR 1.3303 S 0.2 on to 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 eventually to cover the drawdown of the other side. The drawdown is so well contained when you make the channel tight. The EURUSD's spread is 1 pip on ECNs when you can get choice. So look at those proposed entries... what is the worst DD that can happen? Not much at all. You will open craploads of orders in both directions.... but ultimately price will pull away and you can cash in. Suppose price moves away from this 2 pip channel and comes back.... you just keep going until a satisfactory TP is met. I like this idea. -T PS) This might be particularly effective during the Asian session, away from volatile news sessions where spread can widen on news.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Even with a one pip spread you will get stopped out very, very often (Take a look at a tick chart and you see it). Even using a 10 pips spread is sometimes dangerous. A lesser spread doesn't mean a lesser drawdown! Others here made the math and came to the conclusion that a 20 pips spread is often safer using this strategy. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hello Dan (FXTradePro), first i want to say: Thank you very much! secondly i have a question: Would it be possible to built in a function like: if you have 40 pips in your pockets then set stoploss to breakeven(in this case 40 pips) and start trailing stop. Hibernation function should be possible, too. I have started testing Time Entry (7 am GMT ). all the best haubentaucher

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Did you think about sitting out during the first several bounces on the pair, and then starting? As Dan said earlier, there won't be nearly as many signals, but you could have your EA waiting for these bounces on several pairs.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
TDion....I agree with Xaron here. I still prefer the 10 pip stop but one could use 20 with a TP of 80 and still use my Standard Sequence Progression. You would need a larger Account that way. If you trade this with a 20 pips stop and less than an 80 pip TP, the lots sizes would need to be recalculated and it would be difficult to make the Strategy have the ability to last 24 Entries because of margin requirements. Dan

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I tried that... the problem was that I was winning early. I even tried 0.01 pips instead of 0.1 pips; however, I was reaching my TP by the 3rd ro 4th progession, which isn't much money for a night's trading effort. For those who would consider trading GBPJPY, I have found much success with my SL=25 &amp; TP=100. As long as you keep the ratio 1:4, you're fine. Personally, as a rule of thumb my SL s/b at least 2.5 times more than my spread. For example, if the currency has a 4 pip spread, then my SL s/b 10 pips. Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #370 ---
This is a viable idea, but it would trade less often. Waiting for some consolidation and letting it range for a bit is a pretty safe entry method, however, these opportunities present less often. The problem being that we never know how long the Pair will range and we will miss some opportunities. Dan

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Walt.......You are still TOO successful?....LOL. Steady profits are fine, when you are comfortable just trade with a Larger Account and the money will follow. Also, looks to me like 25/100 on GBPJPY could be very good. Dan

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi haubentaucher..........I understand what you are saying, however, I will not be modifying the EA. You could do this manually once your above condition is met. That is, remove the EA, modify your stop and trail in MT4. Actually, you could probably do the above without removing the EA, but you should certainly test that idea. Dan

--- 帖子 #373 ---
TickJob..............Please Post your trading concepts in a SEPARATE Thread. What you are presenting is not what we are doing with the FXTradepro Strategy. Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Another night another winner w/ GBP/USD. Set it in play at 11 pm last night. Went to level 5 again before hitting the TP.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
The problem is "Murphy's Law"... I imagine the moment I increase by lot size (for example, instead of 0.1 for the 1st progression, I increase it to 1.0 - 10 times), that's when it'll run to the 20th progression. Nonetheless, whether it's $100 per night or $1,000 per night, the ROI is still the same. For example the standard lot account requires a capital balance of $47,525 (based upon SL-10 &amp; TP-40). This is a ROI of about 44%, based on 210 trading opportunities per year. A ROI OF 44% IS EXCEPTIONAL IN ANY OTHER INVESTMENT ARENA; however, considering the time, effort &amp; risk, the forex market has a higher expectation. If I increase my lot sizes, then I would need to proportionately increase by capital reserves. Therefore, my ROI will remain at 44%. Sorry for the ramble... Walt

--- 帖子 #376 ---
The 20th Entry will make you LARGE profit by the way and I do way better than 44% annual ROI. Perhaps your entries are just better than mine...LOL. Anyway, I certainly understand your concerns and perhaps the Strategy is not for you in this case, however, you certainly cannot assume that ALL your trades will close at an early position in the Sequence. Trade this for some time and you will see that your average will be considerably higher. Dan

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hey guys, I just wanted to ask a simple question regarding time entry. When you choose Time Entry, do you put in the time as GMT time? Also, when the Time entry is initiated and you have Hibernation set to True does it stay in the progression until it completes and if the progression is still running will the EA open another position at the prescribed time the next day?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hello mer.......For Time Entry it is your BROKER'S SERVER TIME. Regarding HIBERNATE - this EA was not designed to trade as an automated system and I always Trade with hibernate set to TRUE, however, if Hibernate is set to FALSE, it SHOULD open a new Sequence at the time you set everyday, assuming that the previous Sequence of Trades has closed in profit from the day before. I have not tested this as I don't trade it that way, but I believe that it should work that way. Having said that, I really must stress that this EA was designed as a TOOL to Trade my Strategy the way that I Trade it and that I really do not recommend running it as fully automated. Dan

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I tested eur/usd but I did it with my laptop and I had to disconnect it. What I found when I entered again is that EA was working again: good!, I didn't know it, but I saw that the next lot was different, I mean that if the next lot should have been for example the third progression's lot then it began with the fourth progression... Perhaps I must try again but I would like to know what happens exactly if you turn off your computer and then you switch on again. I will continue testing this great EA.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
DO NOT TURN THE COMPUTER OFF when you are in a Sequence Of Trades. ALL EA's must have the PC on and running to work. They do not operate when the PC is turned off or if you close your MT4 Platform. OK, now if you do experience a power outage or internet connection failure, then the EA won't be able to run. When you do come back online the EA will likely skip 1 Entry in the progression if this happens. Now, you CAN toggle the EA off in the middle of a Sequence (you do this on the MT4 platform) and in this case the EA would continue from where you left off when you decide to turn it back on. I hope this is clear now... Dan

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi FXtradepro, Sorry if this entry sounds negative but I think everyone should look at all sides. First let me say, Thank You for all the work you shared with the rest of us in this forum. My issues with this system follow... Las Vegas loves gamblers who double their bet each time they loose because no one has unlimited cash to wait out the times where you have many losses in a row. Those times can wipe out your profits from years of trading. I did a little statistical calculation; let’s assume that there is a 50/50 chance that the price change could go with or against you. Let’s also assume we will follow the price change every 5 pips. Finally for easy of use, lets say the commission is a total of 5 pips round trip. This means our profit target is 45 pips and our stop loss is 5 pips. OK, the results I got testing the first 9 price movements (price had to go your way each movement to reach your profit target), I got the following stats: 1 – reached profit target. 23 – reached stop loss 126 – did not reach either target. Of the 126, the average position was 1.5 pips (closer to stop target than profit target). I’m curious why some traders here WANT the sequence of trades to be high? Do you really want to be risking $5,000 on the 23rd entry to make back $1,500 in profit when the odds are more than 23 to 1 against you? Finally, if I had a losing trade 23 times in a row, I would be looking at my strategies and be trading fewer lots, not more.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I really must tell you that in my opinion boiling everything down to a mathimatical equation just does not mean very much - also, we do not double down as is the case with Martingale Gambling. The real question here is DO YOU BELIEVE that you can find a place and time to enter the Market where price will go 40 pips in your selected direction or 50 pips in the opposite direction before hitting a 10 pip SL more that about 20 times. Look at your charts and you will find many such opportunities to do just this. Statistics have their place, but there are too many variables in the Forex Market to calculate such probabilities with any accuracy. Also, your numbers seem way out of line. I have yet to reach a 24th entry in more than 350 Trades. Dan

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Dan, Thank you for the opportunity to comment. For you, this system probably works great, you must have a good entry strategy. My comments are for the 80%+ of the people that lose money in this market. I did not say your system doubles the lot size each time, but the concept is the same. Just doesn't sound logical to me to increase the size of your lot when your on a losing streak. As for the stats question as opposed to " I believe I will make 40 pips". Your a better trader than I if you can make a profit by what you believe will happen. I assume then, that you dont use any indicators (as they are statistical in nature and indicators use equations). As for the stats being out of line, I understand that you would think that as you are making money on your system. the numbers would change if your success rate was more than 50/50 or your commission was less than 5 pips. My first email was meant to get people thinking of both sides of the coin and what could happen. Finally I realize equations don't mean anything to you but for those that are used to making $100 when they get thier profit target on the 6th entry then are down $20,000 - $30,000 one day, they should know the reality of it. Are they really ready to risk another another 2,000 when they lost 18 in a row? Again, to me it makes more sense increase your lot size when you get good at trading, when your strategy makes money in smaller lot sizes. Not increase you lot sizes when your doing badly. Dan, dont get me wrong, you are doing a great job of presenting your strategy, much more then most people do. But isnt there room here to see the worse case senerio? Shouldn't people consider the profit to risk ratio? Do you really want people to believe that it is just as likely to hit 45 pip profit as 5 pip stop loss or even more so?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Again...It seems to me that you want to boil all Trading down to statistics and YES, people should be fully aware of the risks involved in this and any System. In fact, the calculations I have presented in this Thread certainly bring those risks to the forefront and I am not asking anyone to trade the way that I do or to follow me blindly. I merely presented a Strategy that works well for me. Traders can make up their own minds as to whether the Risk/Reward suits their tolerance. Dan

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi Brib, With all due respect, I think you're off base on this one. Dan's system makes complete sense statistically. When considering the laws of probability, there simply is no better system than this one. With any system, if one were to lose 23 times in a row and expect to eventually make a profit to offset the loses, it would put the individual at risk for losing as much as this system. Regarding the laws of statistical probability (i.e. "odds" for or against a certain event), let us consider the following: - In all probability, the current day's opening price is at or near the prior day's closing price. - In all probability, a given currency pair will range 100 or more pips per day from its opening price. - In all probability, the most volitale time of the market is between 2:00 AM EST &amp; 10:00AM EST - In all actuality, at least one directional trend within a 100 pip range will be at least 50 pips. With the laws of probabilty, coupled with good money management &amp; a smart entry strategy, this by far is the closest thing to the "holy grail". For some, good MM may mean to allow risking only 5% of capital (i.e. only 14 progressions); whereas others may consider good MM to go to 65% of capital (24 progressions) because the statisical probability of a 24 progression blowout is xx% less likely than a 14 progression blowout (I don't know the statisical odds between 14 progressions and 24 progressions, but it can be quantifiable ascertained with backtesting with a specific entry strategy). Walt

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi Dan, Yep, your presentation was very good in showing the drawdown calculations. My intention is not to get into a fight here, only expressing my opinion. Any strategy I come up with starts with an observation of the market, then I confirm that observation with stats (backtesting, foreward testing, different timeframes or currencies, different indicators, etc.) I use those stats to decide what and when to trade. Perhaps we can agree to disagree. I like to confirm and my beliefs with statistics from my testing. You it seems are comfortable with devising and following strategies based on beliefs, without testing or using any statistical analysis. I give you credit, I wish I could be successful using your methodology, but, I can't. I would caution other traders who might not be as experienced as you in that methodology.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
The laws of statisical probabilty confirms that with a good entry strategy and good MM, odds are that one will not experience a blowout in over 400 trades. As Dan stated, he has entered more than 350 trades and never exceeded 24 progessions. That is EXTREMELY POWERFUL. Which other system can make such an assertion? Walt

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Even if a blowout were to occur after 400+ trades, one would have already earned twice as much in profits more the amount of the loss... Walt

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Ok, that is enough. the point and counter point have been made. Anything more would just be a arguement. I see nothing new in these recent posts, so lets end it here with the agreement to disagree. Moderator.

I suggest that anyone looking at this Strategy take a close look at Support and Resistance areas on a 30 Minute Chart and see what generally occurs at these areas. Typically, price will either retrace or Break at these price points. Now if we enter our Initial Entry in a Sequence just outside of these ranges (ie - SELL just above resistance or BUY just below support), often we can avoid having our stop hit an excessive number of times. Now, if we hold off on entering the Sequence until a time that we suspect volatility will increase, for example the UK Session, then we can additionally increase our potential for a good trade. Focus on trying to find the TIME &amp; PLACE to enter when the Market is poised to move either 40 pips in your selected direction or 50 pips in the opposite direction - Support and Resistance fits that criteria well. Dan

Thanks jones, great explanation. Yes, this is a risky method, but the whole life is a risk and the forex market even riskier. This strategy isn't usable for everyone, that's for sure. Noone can predict the future or in which direction the price will move, but we can predict where on which points the price will move faster. These points are usually support/resistance zones. Why does there show up nice movements on these points? Because a lot of stop and limit order are at these levels... We don't know if it will go up or down there but we now, there will be some nice movement. Regards - Xaron

Hi Dan. Let me jump on the bandwagon and thank you for your inordinate amount of time and effort to bring us this semi-automated/discretionary system. I’ve just finished going through 27 pages of posts. I’m a newbie to FX but have spent a lot of time with stock and Index trading (with varying degrees of successes and blow outs). I’m currently going through the Babypips.com lessons and have several books I’m devouring. Do you (or anyone) have any suggestions on the best sites to open a demo account so that I can get my brain around the EA using the MT software? I saw someone was using IBFX. Do they offer a demo account? I’m currently at work and can’t access their site. Again thanks! Tom

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Welcome Tom.........I trade with IBFX and they do have a Demo for you to test on. There are many other MT4 Broker's as well. I hope you get something out of joining us here. Dan

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I'm trying the EA along with Swiss Army Knife (attached) for a scalper. Running on multi-pairs, hibernate "OFF", set on "BUY", so it simply runs all the time. Preset has been changed to nano-lots. Swiss Army Knife is set to close all open positions when aggregate profit reaches $1.00. Then the cycle repeats. We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Now there is an unusual approach! Just remember that the EA has not really been tested in a HIBERNATE = FALSE mode as I do not Trade the Strategy that way. I also do not Trade with a Random Entry. Let us know how you are doing. Dan

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Well, it's not going to work. The mandatory magic number reset stops the process. Onward..

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi Tom, I can recommend Alpari as MT4 broker. They have a never expiring demo account (you have to log in at least once in 90 days) and a very good data feed and reliable servers. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #403 ---
FXTradepro, you said in post #378 Then you said in post #400 I'm a little confused Do you trade with Hibernate on or off?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Also by the way I am 2 for 2 with trades closed using EUR/JPY at 10/40 and GBP/JPY at 25/100. EUR/JPY closed at level 8 and GBP/JPY at level 1. I tried out timed entries with Hibernation ON with the EUR/JPY right at the beginning of the Asian session yesterday and adjusted the GBP/JPY to start up a couple of hours before London open. I will try and and play with times in the next week or so to see what happens. I'm also looking at the possibility of using Muerry Levels as possible entry points as well. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hibernation is set to true , so the EA will stop after reaching the tp. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Although the spreads in IBFX are high, it's great in a real account and with this method because IBFX offer microlots in a miniaccount

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Mr Xaron, was that you at Oanda forum ? by the way, how's Alpari ? i've only heard of them recently ! hope they're as reliable as their servers........ if you don't mind, do they offer accounts in other currencies other than USD ? can a trailstop be run on their servers like FXCM ??? sorry for so many questions.......

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Yes, that's me on the Oanda forum as well. Alpari has very reliable servers and is one of the best MT4 brokers in my opinion with tight spreads. The only drawback (not for me): They don't accept US citizens yet. They offer accounts in EUR (I use an euro account), GBP, CHF and USD. I haven't used trailing stops so far, I guess they come from MT? If yes, then they will work. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #409 ---
anyone tried if keeping the TP same as SL at 10 pips but doubling the units bought each progression ? or is that even more risky despite the lower TP having higher chance of being hit ?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
If u gona double the lots each roung then u'r gonna be using a martingale system, and thats not good until u have a good technical analyses of the trade and margin to continue doubling if it happens any thuing that wasn't on your plans hehehe

--- 帖子 #411 ---
My error there..........I alway set HIBERNATE = TRUE - sorry! I have corrected this in the earlier Post. Dan

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I'm using a simple strategy that's similar to FXtardepro strategy, i was using this strategy since nov/05 but i was doing mannualy , so goto thanks to Fxtradepro for sharing his ea with us, the strategy that i'm using it's simple i'm only entering on big news that have a range of 40+ pips on the first 30minuts after the news release, an setting the lots as martingale, ie. 1,2,4,8,16,32.. since i'm using this strategy the maximum number of trades that have to be opened was 6trades. It sims riskly but, i use about 0,5%of the margin as initial lot on a mini account so, the results it's like this: Usually it take 3 trades do close on the tp so it like this that happens, te's take as example an mini aacount with 5K, so lets go to the example: 0.25 closed on sl -10pips -2,50USD 0.50 closed on sl -10pips -5,00USD 1.00 closed on sl -10pips -10USD 2.00 closed on tp +40pips +80USD total = 62,50USD it seems that isn't a great result, but 62,50USD it's more than 1% of the account balance. We have abou 4 great news at least on a month that have movs bigger than 40pips, so its abou 4trades that u would do one a month, so ussualy trqade on usdjpy and gbpusd cause of the spread and the range that it haves, i trade only in this 2 at the same time and no more pairs, to limit the risks of the trade, só if u make 4 trades on this 2 pair a month u will to about 8trades monthly and generaty a profit between 4 and 10% of your account balance, i'm ussing this stratey on my live account since nov/05 and that's the results that i'm habing with it, u can test on a demo account to as see by yourself hehehehe.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Interesting approach.....I have also Traded this type of set up at News time in the past, but I am not currently doing that as I am careful about Trading during spread widening at my Broker I am curious as to what MT4 Broker you are using for this concept. Dan

--- 帖子 #414 ---
SO....Where are any new people? Let's hear from you...520 downloads of the EA - I know you are out there....LOL Dan

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Well, I downloaded it, but I don't technically consider myself as "new." I am just usually quite and don't ask a lot of questions. Just read and read and try to figure out what is happening for bothering with useless and overasked questions. But, at the moment, I am forward testing the EA on an IBFX account, running 24 hours a day. Plan was to let it run for atleast 30-45 days to see how it holds up, and this it the normal thing I do with any new ideas/theories that come out. I currently have 7 copies of IBFX open right now, just to do tests on multiple things. So, hopefully in a month or so, if it does well, or does horribly, I will try to post the full results. Have fun and enjoy trading. Adam Abrahamson

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thanks for the comments Adam.....Just remember that this EA is a Tool and was not designed for automated 24/7 Trading. I am not sure how you are using it from your Post, but let us know....... and Good Trading to you. Dan

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Yes, I am aware. I even downloaded your full template, to try and get an idea of when a better time to start the initial entry would be. I also, attached one of my home built systems (something I tried to discuss about a year or so ago on the forums), which gives me pretty solid entry times using 4 different moving averages. So, I will be using it on a seperate account to decide when to enter the trade, too. Again, hope to see how it goes. Adam Abrahamson

--- 帖子 #418 ---
OK...GOOD LUCK and let me know how you are doing. Dan

--- 帖子 #419 ---
this is driving me crazy Dan! everytime a sequence starts it doesn't progress according to what i have it just keeps opening .25, .25, .25, .25 etc. all this is messing my live trades up. i dont understand this! what to do?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
i don't get this! it is working on my demo but not my damn live acct. does anybody know why this is happening?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hmm... have you changed the magic number value? Have you removed and reattached the EA to the chart? The chart where the EA runs on must be open all the time... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi ggarbuio , Mind to share which 4 major news you are trading? Best wishes! SF

--- 帖子 #423 ---
criss.....I really don't know why you are having this issue. Remove the EA from the chart and reapply and change the Magic number. Perhaps you should try and download the EA again - maybe something happened there. You might also try and clear the Global Variables on your MT4 Platform although I am not certain that this will help, but it's worth a try. I am sorry, but this is not an issue that I have ever seen on my IBFX Live Platform or have I heard about from anyone else. Dan

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Did he turn on EA trading in his live account from the Tools/Options/Expert Adivsors menu. at the top of the screen?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Firstly, thanks Fxtradepro for sharing your ideas and trading plan. You made it clear enough to everyone to understand and at same time professionally presented . . . I have something to share concerning entry points which seem to be a questionable point over this thread. If we classified your system into the Volatility driven category then, the best entry points will be at low volatility times expecting increasing volatility in either price directions which is the objective of Fxtradepro strategy. I recommend here 2 available technical indicators on MT4 as follows: - Bollinger bands 10,2 - Standard deviation 10 IMO, the best times for entry are when Bollinger 2 bands are closer to eachother than average and SD at its lowest values over last 50-100 bars. I usually expect a breakout at the direction of middle BB band (not a must ). Just food for thought. Think about. Hani

Today: eur/jpy: +40 pips (sl:10, tp:40) Time: 09:57 GMT (IBFX), Sell 162.10 - 161.70, closed at 11:13 (second progression) gbp/usd: working yet...

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I'm using on usdgbp usdjpy gbpusd adn usdchf, also using sometimes on eurjpy

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello Hani......I will take a look at your suggestion to see what I find. BB's can be a good Indicator of expected Volatility. I have used them in the past in my Trading. Dan

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I'm consistently successful with GBPJPY... This is the result of my last trade: entry @ 2:35 GMT; closed @ 11:14 GMT... 12th progression... SL-25, TP-105... The only problem is the maximum capital margin reserves needed to protect against 24 progressions. Based on the FXTradepro calculator, I would need about 94,250 (although I belive that the cross currency valuation would actual require about $82,000)... Nonetheless, the point is that my captial requirement for this currency pair is much more substantial than the traditional SL-10 &amp; TP-40 strategy for pairs with lower spreads . As a rule of thumb, my SL s/b at least 2.5 times greater than the spread. Of course, as a positive offset, the profits are proportionately higher in accordance to the capital reserve requirements. Walt

All TRUE Walt..........Continued success ! Dan

--- 帖子 #431 ---
ggarbuio........I think seafront was asking WHICH Specific News Events you trade with this Method. Care to share....? Dan

--- 帖子 #432 ---
FxTradePro: I believe i remember reading on the earlier pages, that you purchased this EA. Did you hire someone to "code" it for you, or did you actually purchase it from another company. Only reason I ask, is because as I said earlier, I was hoping to try it by intergrating it with my (my own built) EA. It is a trend-follow EA, and works a good portion of the time, but when it is wrong, the market usually moves against it 50-100pips. My objective was to have my coding, inserted with your money management, so that my code opened the trade (timing), then have your money-management take over. Basically, making it a walk-away type of system. If you purchased it from another company, would you be willing to send me private message, and tell me who it is through, because I would like to purchase a copy from them so that I can view/change the code. Again, this is what I do for a living. I sit at home, and watch trades all day and read forums. It's a cozy, boring life, and I like to try new things. If you "hired" someone to code it for you, then nevermind, and i completely understand how you would want to keep it to yourself. If that is the case, I am either going to have to figure out if I can have my EA running, and have it call onto yours when a trade opens, or either just code the money management system and try to mimic the semi-mart setup. Restating: If either you, or a hired person coded it, ignore all of this, because I understand how it feels to have people messing with your work. I put my EA for testing about a year and a half ago, and was flooded with non-stop people saying that I should change things, add things, not working on their machines, etc, etc, etc, etc. But, if you bought it from a retailer, I would love to get a copy of it so I can interject my own code to tell it when to open/close. Thank you, Adam Abrahamson

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Adam.....This EA was coded FOR ME by various programmers that I hired over the course of many months. I have also done some very minor tinkering myself to get it just right. I am glad you understand that I am not going to share the code. Dan

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hey Dan, Been very intrigued by this MONEY MGT TOOL since I came across this thread yesterday. I finally had enuf spare time to read all 29 pages, and I figure I'm download #521......or most likely higher!!! I've been trading pivots, support, resistance on Daily and Weekly candles as my bread and butter for several months now, and I think this will improve my already profitable work, but as stated on many ocassions, it will not turn me into an instant millionaire.....maybe just a McDollarnaire (Is Burger King reading this...no posts from him ) Anyway, I've set it up on a demo to get the feel for it, then I will be trying it modestly (as in micro-minis) on my live support/resistance trades very soon, and I will report in. And don't worry about all those critics, they're just pissed b/c they were some of those that THOUGHT they could retire early with a $2k account!!! J/K boys and girls.....don't come for my head Thanks for the clear thoughts, and very well assembled, and maintained thread. -Jim from Minnesooooooota

Two more trades taken today. I tried to do a timed entry on EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY at 6:00 GMT, a couple of hours before the London open this morning. I had my Hibernate set to true but the EA did not open any trades so, as a test, I reset the EA to open at 18:00 GMT today with the hibernation off and it opened the trades with no problem. My EUR/JPY closed at 00:44 on the 11th progression for $302.82 profit + $15.63 swap. My GBP/JPY closed just a few minutes ago at 01:31 on the 8th progression for $408.75 profit and $29.44 swap. I will try again this morning around 6:00 GMT to see if it opens a timed entry with the hibernate set to true, otherwise I will leave it set to false. 4 trades total for a profit of $1,007.24, not bad for two days work!!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Just cleared 40 TP in only 2 progression on the AUD/USD. 6pm CST is a good time to trade this pair long, so I set my first buy entry 5 pips about the 6pm close price .8652. 1st entry was a sell, for a 10 pip loss, then the 2nd entry missed the stop by 1 pip, then never looked back. +30 net in 1 hr 45 mins. I will be looking for another good entry on the GBP/USD during London later.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Nice Trading...........The Timed Entry option should certainly work with HIBERNATE = TRUE, make sure all your other settings are correct and that you always change the Magic Number for every new Sequence opened. I use it that way with no problems. Dan

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi again learning....I took the same Trade on AUDUSD - Initial Entry Short. My entry was a little different, however, and my TP did not hit on the rise. The progression continued and finally closed at the 11th Entry as AUD retraced. Dan

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Indeed. -Jim

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi FXTradepro, Thanks for sharing the strategy. I spent some serious hours testing it using tick data from gain captical (millions of ticks, using hand made VB/SQL program to run tests). Pair: EUR/JPY from 1/2006 to 8/2007. Tried all sorts of tp, sl &amp; timed entries (japan open, london open, ny open etc.). Maximum progressions: 20 (i know you can do much better with discretion rather than time entry);most trades finish in up to 14 progressions. A couple of "trades" last several days (maybe it was during some of bank holidays! didn't look into it as i am lazzy at looking charts). Also tried "stop loss" after certain number of progressions and only managed to break even. Overall, it has hope in long run (with luck and bit skill and big heart). Better than throwing money to lottery or trading hundrends of indicators. Cheers SF

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hi Seafront, Could you tell us how many trades hit the 20th progression from 1/2006 to 8/2007?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
didn't keep all trades as many combinations were tried. roughly remember 20 progressions got hit 1 or 2 times; 15 to 19 got 4 or 6 times. that is why i said there is hope...

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks for the input BUT just remember that as I've mentioned continuously, this Strategy works best for me with a DISCRETIONARY Initial Entry. Also, there are things that one can do if we get caught in a tight range and the progression levels get to the high side, such as turning the EA off and resuming the Sequence once the tight range is broken. You still need to know HOW to Trade to be successful. This Method just enables us to make some "mistakes" along the way and still be profitable. Dan

--- 帖子 #446 ---
First of all, I appreciate for your posting very deeply! And I have a question in the situation of computer off (ex. Computer shutdown or Internet connection off ) What can i do in this situation?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Welcome jphole......PC shutdown or Internet connection issues are a concern for ALL Expert Advisors and not just the FXTradepro Manager EA. That is why I had the SL and TP Levels coded so that they exist on your Broker's Server. In the event of a Internet or PC failure 1 of 2 things will occur. Either your SL will be hit and the next Level in the Sequence will NOT be able to open or your TP will be hit. If the TP is hit then there is no problem. If the SL is hit then there will not be any new Levels opened until your connection is restored. At that point the EA will pick up the Sequence from where it left off (it MAY skip 1 Level sometimes when power is lost). I have had this happen to me once and things worked out fine. It certainly could be an issue if this connection failure occurs at a deep level in the progression. Remember that there is always risk in Internet Trading of any kind. Dan

--- 帖子 #448 ---
So..in that situation, I just only rerun MT4 platform and reactivate EA? or do something more? Pardon my ignorance for EA system.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Trades today: eur/jpy: 12:04-12:52 (IBFX GMT) Buy 162.38 - 162.78 Profit in the fith progression +40 gbp/usd: 13:13-15:24 (IBFX GMT) Buy 2.0169 - 2.0209 Profit in the third progression +40

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Yes...Just activate the Platform and the EA SHOULD resume. If the EA does NOT resume for some odd reason, you can remove the EA and reload it BUT you would need to change the Lot Sizes so that the Initial Entry begins at the Lot Size that is next in your existing Sequence and continue from there. Since the Strategy allows for many levels these issues can be worked through without too much concern. I hope this is clear.... Dan

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hey Dan, I love numbers, but ironically, I'm no statistician. I'm not suggesting monkeying with your parameters, but just wondering what the quick and dirty answer would be as to why the 2nd progression lot size is the same as the 1st? I guess my thought was it would increase........maybe not double, but maybe a half a lot? Again, I'm sure there is a great reason why this is less efficient, just wondering what the net effect is, as I assume you already have the answer . Thanks, Jim BTW- made + 40 = $480 in 8 progression GBP/USD overnite!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi Jim, there is no need to increase the lot size in the 2nd progression because of the TP40 and SL10. If you increase the lot size in the 2nd progression you have to increase the following position sizes, too. That way you would end up with a higher lot size in the higher progression levels which is more risky. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hey Jim............Xaron gave you the correct answer ! Thanks Xaron! Dan

--- 帖子 #454 ---
You are right about the later progressions, but I thought maybe it would go 1, 1.5 then 2 lots on the 3rd trade, but from a basic perception, what's the difference? you lost $10 in the first trade and would net $50 vs. $30 if the 2nd progression worked out.................don't spend that extra $20 all in one place!! Of course, if the 2nd is a loss, you are out $5 (a net of $15 more on winners vs. losers). I would think however, over time, there are far more trades that go to the 3rd level and beyond, so that net of $15 would get gobbled up fast. See, I knew there was a reason!! Thanks for making me think it through, Jim

--- 帖子 #455 ---
two trades today: Both entered at 6:00 GMT. EUR/JPY at 10/40 and GBP/JPY at 25/100. EUR/JPY closed@ 8:12 GMT on the 11th progression for a profit of $307.30 GBP/JPY closed@ 8:15 GMT on the 7th progression for a profit of $322.99 6 total trades for a profit of $1,637.50

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Jim....Locate, download and play around with the FXTradepro Manager Calculator which is in this thread or at the Private Forum and you will get a good understanding of the relationship of Lot Size, Progressions, Profits and Losses etc...It is a good exercise to see how these things relate to the Strategy. Dan

--- 帖子 #457 ---
You're doing well mer.....Keep us posted, especially on the GBPJPY trades as I don't generally keep an eye on that pair. Dan

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi FXTradepro, 100% agree to what you say. My stats is based on blinded time entry. Just to foresee the possible worse situation so one can get prepared before jumping in. Have a nice weekend! SF

Today i have some questions for IBFX I'm trading now in demo account very well So i' going to open live account at IBFX But can I use this EA in both Mini account and Standard account? and can i trade Micro lots(0.01) in both Mini account and Standard account? Waiting for reply, thanks

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Walt, Here are some stats to consider with your approach. Running GBP/JPY with an SL = 25 (assuming 9 pip spread), TP = 105, and a prog level out to 24, you will have a risk of failure at 1:23 , assuming you just entered randomly - which I know you are not but it does serve as a comparison since if you traded Dans progression in the exact same manner the comparitive risk is 1:66 ... which is much safer! Conclusion - why trade GBP/JPY!!!!!!!! You are taking on nearly three times the risk than you would if you just traded using your entry method and Dans original progression sequence. You may be making more profit since your progression requires at least twice the capital outlay compared to what Dans does - so I doubt your releative return is that much better, and any additional profit is relative to the risk you take. If is also false to assume it is a good pair to trade because of its volatility - the brokers compensate by increasing the spread - so you have actually had to compensate for this by increasing your SL - which in turn forces you to increase your TP to get a meaningful progression sequence - and a reasonable profit curve. So forget the idea that you are going to make more, or gain better volatility that will improve your odds. In fact you are trading with much more risk when trading the GBP/JPY and the progression sequence you suggest. If you want to assess which pairs are best to trade- then a possible way to rank them is to look at what I call the "Risk Coefficent" (RC) - that is the Average Daily Range (over ~10 days) divided by the broker spread. The higher the RC the better the pair is to trade from a (theoretical) risk versus volatility perspective. So for example: Euro/USD = 70/2 = 35 GBP/USD = 150/4 = 37.5 Euro/JPY = 165/4 = 41.25 GBP/JPY = 290/9 = 32 So you can see there are probably better pairs to trade than GBP/JPY. Tim

am i right to say this....... 1) i long at 1.1000.......then got stopped out at 1.0990 2) i now short at 1.0990.......and need to go down to 1.0950 for the TP of 40pips, right ? ( so i need price to move 50 pips in the right direction after suffering a stoploss ? ) this can be done manually, right ? i was tempted to try it out as it can give daily profits but seems to need a big a/c to give USD100 daily profit...........also the fear of an extended choppy market might kill me off.........

--- 帖子 #465 ---
You are right. And yes, this can be done manually. I did this at Oanda . It needs heavy screen time especially in the beginning of a trade sequence. Regards - Xaron

I try this semi-martingale on YM(Dow mini) with one of trend indicator for entry signal and get the following result since July07, I still think that stock index future is a better instrument to trade

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Just wanted to say thanks for your hard work and for sharing your system. Also, thank you to everyone else who has shared their results and possible modifications. I have been tinkering with my own similar system for awhile now and reading this thread has really helped me to see that I was on the right track. My problem is I was trading manually and because I'm not able to be in front of the computer from the start of the European open to the NY close every day, I missed many breakout opportunities. Your EA will be an incredible help with this! I will be using it to demo trade for now, but will probably move up to micro-lots in my live account after I'm sure I have it running properly. Then to mini-lots where I hope to see the success that others in this thread are enjoying. I'd also appreciate it if you'd PM or email me your private forum so I may join all of you there as well. Thanks again!

Hello FXTRADEPRO, I just came across this thread, and I like what I see so far. I have two questions though. One, how do you change the magic number? Is it some random digits or do I have to pm you each time for a new set of numbers? Two, I have some difficulties getting the EA to trade at a preset time, maybe because I don't know the right way to put it. What, for instance is the GMT for London Open? If I want to preset the EA to trade during this time how do I do it? I'm in the EST. Sorry some questions sound dumb. Thanks

I have had some success on demo account using: TP =100 SL =100 GBPJPY 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 etc Maximum trades before profit for the past 4-5 weeks = 4

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Interesting results......Obviously you need to double the Lots in the Sequence because of the large SL. Subsequently, you would not be able to last as many progressions as my standard set-up, however, with such a large SL, you would not likely need as many. Keep us posted... Dan

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I'm about to test this system with a swing trader's methodology. In other words, instead of SL-10, TP-40 with GBPUSD, I am using the following for GBPUSD: SL-75, TP-150, with a semi-martingale position sizing. I not certain whether to begin with 0.1 lots or 1.0 lots. I typically will enter after the 3rd consecutive daily retracement. Walt

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Walt..........The Strategy is certainly adaptable to a Swing Trading Methodology. I personally don't think that your SL should be so big but that is an individual choice. Also, a smaller SL will enable you to sustain more potential progressions with less funds. Just some food for thought. Let us know how this works out for you. Dan

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi Walt, Just a quick comment - I think you would need to be able to work out your lots sequence for this progression to run at least to the 10th level to ensure a reasonable success level (chance of failure is 1:44 if randomly entered with 10 level progression, compared to Dans original of 1:66 if you were to trade it randomly...and of course the same odds apply if you trade both these progressions yourself with exactly the same entry method). I assume you will be taking the initial trade in the direction of the primary trend after the three days of retracement. And your testing of this entry method gives you a greater than 50% success rate when traded with an SL of 75 and a TP of 150. If this is the case then this type of structured entry method would considerably improve your trading odds as opposed to a random entry. Note: One thought on these larger 'swing' size progression sequences - at least you won't have the high stress levels associated with tight SL levels and the price action "burning" through 4 or 5 levels quickly. So this type of swing progression sequence trading can be much better from a pyscological perspective. Keep us posted on results. Tim

Unfortunate for me i lost $650 in a EURJPY trade. It went as high as 18th progression and came to 1 pip from take profit. I opened a trade at 162.34 on 9/21. As you can see on the chart there is a lot of resistance there and pushed upwards then retreated. I just thought i let you guys know.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Sorry for your loss Bruno.......Since you did not Post a Chart I cannot see your Entry. What would have happened if you had enough margin for 24 Entries? Also, as a suggestion, when you get caught in a tight range you always have the option of turning the EA off for awhile until price breaks the range. The EA will continue the Sequence when you turn it back on. Keep at it.... Dan

--- 帖子 #484 ---
hey Fxtradepro, it wouldn't have survived the 24th progression. And i'm not always around to turn off EA it needed.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Bruno, What time did you enter this trade on Friday? I wonder why you let this one go over the weekend? Looks like you had several chances to get out at least B/E by the end of the Europe session...... Thoughts? -Jim

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Firstly I use IBFX demo account for testing and trade seven pairs which IBFX offers less than 5pip spreads . EUR/JPY ended 22th entry~WOW (I use random entry.. no analysis no thinking, for testing) but anyone knows how to attatch *.htm or *.jpg file?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Trading of this nature requires monitoring (especially with a tight stop).....Personally, I would not Trade if I could not be available to keep an eye on things every couple of hours. That's just me, others may have differing opinions. Dan

--- 帖子 #488 ---
the arrow on my chart is where it got me in. i was watching all those hours and i thought it would go up. i did keep the trade open through the weekend and i thought it would move up. what can i say.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
i agree with you. unfortunately i'm learning the hard way.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I've been trading over 2 years and feel that you have to adapt to the market. Yes I have a active account which brings in positive gains. In my opinion you should have three different technical indicators that shows direction, strength, and breakouts. Look, the market will either be ranging, or trending. The indicators you use should show what the market is doing. Example: Strong direction + strong strength = trending market. Weakening direction + weakening strength = trend reversal or ranging market. Your success will depend on your technical indicators and your understanding of fundamentals. Will semi-martingale strategy work? It's probable but I wouldn't use it. Just seems to risky.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hello Texas......I agree that we need to adapt to an ever changing market. Fortunately, this Strategy is not automated and allows Traders to adapt. I've stated many times that this is a TOOL that I use to execute my Trading Plan. Part of my plan is to adapt to market conditions and I can do that by carefully selecting my entry points, changing my EA parameters, NOT Trading when conditions seem unclear and turning the EA off if I get caught in a bad situation. Discretion is the Key and anyone reading this thread must understand that concept. Dan

Whew, had me a scare today on EUR/JPY! I put in my normal timed entry at 6:00 GMT and let her ride and went all the way to the 24th entry! It could've been because Mondays are a statistically slow trading day, who knows. Luckily price went my way and it closed out for a nice profit of $1579.88. I'm thinking because of the volatility of the pair of adjusting my settings to 15 stop and 60 TP instead of 10/40 and moving my entry time to 7 or 8 GMT. I'm pretty much stuck to a timed entry as I do work another job and need my beauty sleep. Anyone with any other ideas or options? My GBP/JPY closed out on the 16th progression for a profit of $1827.94. I'm also testing out NZD/USD with settings of 12 48 because of a higher spread. FXTradepro, I also found a possible way to stretch out past 24 progressions but your coder will have to add a feature to the EA. On my EUR/JPY I had opened another chart and added a Breakeven EA that brings the stop to breakeven after X number of pips that you choose. Here's an example, let's say you are on EUR/USD at progression level 17 (13 lots), and your target is 40 pips the Breakeven EA is set to 30 pips. When price has hit the 30 pip mark and the EA has moved your stop and then price goes against you and stops you out, what you would have is a trade with no loss instead of a -$1300.00 loss. Currently the FXTradepro Manager EA just goes to the next progression level in line. If possible, what would be cool is if the FXTradepro Manager EA could be coded to include the Breakeven EA coding and then be able open another trade at that same progression level . Basically what has happened is you just just received a free trade and an extra progression level!! :surprised Even if it can't be merged in with your EA this can save a lot of money for those who are using the FXTradepro Manager EA now. Any thoughts?

mer....A Timed Entry alone, without some other reason to enter a Sequence can be dangerous, as you have now seen. I really do suggest that everyone pick their Initial Entry very carefully. Today was not a very active day in the Market (except for GBPUSD) as most pairs did not make their ADR (at least for the 7 pairs I track) - as a hint, I have noticed that when there are not any News Releases for a particular day (speeches don't count for me), that often these days produce very limited volatility - as such, I often stay away. This is not a rule, but something I have noticed. Regarding the EA - I have no plans to alter the code of the EA, mainly because of the fact that I am a fulltime Trader and am always near my charts when I have a Sequence in progress. As a matter of fact - did you know that you can manually alter your "HARD" stop and TP on your MT4 Platform while the FXTradepro Manager is running? You may be able to figure out a way to use this information to your benefit to achieve a similar result to what you describe above. Remember that I use the FXTradepro Manager as a Trading Tool and I prefer not to complicate the code by adding features that I will not likely use. Remember, you always have the option of trying to have a similar EA coded if there are certain functions that you would like. Personally I have no interest in spending my time on the further testing of any such Tool. For me, I prefer to explore the best way to Trade with the Tools that I have (and that I know are tested and work well). Thanks for your input.... Dan

I had a couple of nice and easy Trades today: USDJPY opened at around Midnight EST - Closed at 8th Entry +$167.10 GBPUSD opened at around 9 AM this morning - Closed at 3rd Entry +$60.00 I took the GBPUSD trade this morning even though there was a News Release for USD at 10 AM because I liked the Price Action this morning. When spreads widened for the News at IBFX my trade was already +30 pips and the TP hit just as the News did. Dan

--- 帖子 #495 ---
In news time spread, widens more than 10 pips I think SL doesn't work and only TP set at 40? If then, the EA lose control over the unlimited loss? I have to set SL manually ?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
jp.....I don't generally trade during News, however, if I understand your question, then it depends. Most Brokers do not allow stops to be placed inside the spread. So what happens if you are in a Sequence and the spread widens for News is this: Usually your stop would be hit and then the EA will attempt to place the next Entry in the Sequence. While the spread is wide, the Broker will not accept the order with a 10 pip stop. The EA will keep trying to place the order. When spreads return, the next entry in the Sequence will be opened. Did you experience something else? Also - What I do if I am in a Sequence at News Time and my progression is higher than I am comfortable with then I would TOGGLE the EA OFF on the MT4 Platform and wait for spreads to return to normal. Then I would TOGGLE the EA back on at that point. Dan

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Firstly pardon my ugly english You understand what i mean exatly! And I haven not experienced yet (now trading in demo only) but just worry Thank you for your answer P.S. How can i TOGGLE the EA on od off ?

--- 帖子 #498 ---
At the TOP of your MT4 Platform (toolbar) there is a BUTTON called Expert Advisors with a small Icon. If it is Green then it is ON...Click it and it turns RED and this will disable the EA until you turn it back on. Leave the EA on your chart, DO NOT REMOVE IT. I hope this helps... Dan

Ok Folks.....The FXTradepro Manager EA has been downloaded 617 times in a month or so. Looks to me like alot of people are looking at this Method. The people who have been Posting here are ALL wonderful, BUT, let's hear from some NEW people also. I know you are out there.... Dan

--- 帖子 #501 ---
This semi-martingale will reduce the number of progression if you let the support/resistance to form first, then enter buy when it break support, or enter sell when it break resistance.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hi Dan, When you toggle off the EA and wait for spreads to return to normal, the stoploss could have been hit and say you were at 8th level or higher which would be quite a loss. By the time the spreads return to normal, the price could have move far away and so now you had to find a way to enter again and what if this time market were in a range and kept on hitting stoploss which increase the progress level from 8th to much higher level and hence more drawdown. How do you handle this situation? Even when spreads return to normal, how do know when to get back in? Wait for support &amp; resistance again? But at this time, the progression level already high and hence you won't have much chances left to recover.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hi Dan, I think there are a lot of guys who just download everything they can get and never visit this thread again. Anyway, thanks for that great approach again! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #504 ---
EATrader..........What you say about price moving away during News is potentially correct and I cannot give you any FORMULA to handle this type of situation. I was merely describing how I sometimes handle a Trade if I get caught in a Sequence when spreads widen. Also for your information, I don't consider the 8th Level as "Quite a Loss" but everyone will have differing opinions about this I guess. Regarding your question about knowing when to get back in.....Again, this is so highly discretionary that it is difficult to explain, however, for example, I might restart the EA on the RETRACE of the Spike when spreads have returned to normal.....I really can't give more details because every Trade is different. Having said this...understand that I generally stay out of the Market during News. The best way for you to learn how to handle spread widening is to practice OR to stay out of the Market during these periods. Dan

You are probably right Xaron......... Thanks, Dan

Today trading 3 pairs: gbp/usd, usd/jpy and eur/jpy GBP/USD: Open in the 5th progression at 11:30 GMT: 2.0131, closed at 2.0171 (12:30): 40 pips EUR/JPY: Open in the 4th progression at 12:30 GMT: 162.76, closed at 163.16 (13:56): 40 pips USD/JPY: Working

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I had a strange occurance with the EA today. I entered a buy position with gbpjpy at 3:03 GMT (11:03 PM EST last night). At 8:48 GMT the sequence progressed to the 10th entry (2 lots). This entry closed at 11:30 GMT because the SL was reached. The problem is with what happened next . At 11:30 GMT the next entry opened at 8 lots. However, it should have opened at 2.7 lots. I don't understand why it jumped from the 10th entry (2 lots) to the 15th entry (8 lots). There was no time gap between the close of the 10th entry and the opening of the 15th entry, so I don't think that I lost internet connection... but I'm not sure. Does anyone have any ideas on what may have caused this anomaly? P.S. this glitch earned me $3,727.91 (SL-25, TP-100); however, things could have gone badly against me... as in an account "blow up" if I needed the additional 5 entries between the 10th entry and the 15th entry in order to reach my TP this given sequence. Walt

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Very strange indeed Walt......I have NEVER seen an occurrence of what you describe. I have seen the EA skip 1 progression BUT only when power was lost or my connection went down. I really have NO IDEA and I bet it is a one time thing. A possible solution - and this is why I like to keep an eye on my trades - is that you could have stopped the EA and reprogrammed the Sequence so that the first trade opened would have been the 2.7 Lots. Of course, you would have needed to be available to notice this. Again, I must stress that even though this has been very well tried and tested, things can happen and it is good practice to check on your Sequence periodically. Dan

--- 帖子 #509 ---
I appreciate the advise Dan. However, if the best time to trade is during the London market, how you do cope with the difference in time. In other words, when would you have time to sleep??? Walt

--- 帖子 #510 ---
When money is riding....I don't sleep much (LOL)...That's what weekends are for. Remember, I trade fulltime. But seriously, What happened to you has NEVER happened to me so I have no idea what occurred. Have you looked at the LOGS on the MT4 Platform (Journal and/or experts tabs). That may provide some clues as to what happened. Dan

sorry if this has been answered, but I have loaded the EA and all indicators, once I decide on my entry do I just enter this manually, select new order and leave stop loss and TP at 0 in Mt4 ETC then the EA does the rest?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hello Safire............ALL Trades INCLUDING the Initial Entry are handled by the EA. You have 3 options for entry once you decide you want to start a Sequence Of Trades. 1) Immediate Entry (opens the first Trade on the first Tick after the EA is applied to the Chart. 2) Timed Entry - (Opens the first Trade at a specified time - Your BROKER's Server Time). 3) Price Entry (Open the first Trade at a specified price). Please review the instructions provided in the earlier Posts and let me know if you need any more advice. Dan

Yes Dan, I was nervous ha ha Today: GBP/USD, closed in the first progression : 2007-09-28 - 10:07 - Buy - 2.0293 2007-09-28 - 12:06 - closed - 2.0333 Total: 40 pips

Set up the EA on the GBP/USD last night around 11pm. Entered as LONG at 2.0235. The TP closed out at 2.0275. Went to the 5th Level with a total profit of $90. I have not run this in a couple days, but it still is a constant money maker if you plan out where you want your entries. Great work again to FXTRADEPRO for this program....

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Thanks Jimbo..........Stick with it! Dan

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Man...Going to the 21st level!!!! If you have the bank to do it more power to you, but I really try to place my entries an hour or so before the Euro/ London markets opens. Usually there is a big enough move after the open that it will hit the TP level without jacking up the progressions. One thing I do use from the indicators that were provided by FXTRADEPRO was the "ADR". It has to be at least 70 or greater for that pair before I will place the EA on it.

Another 40 pips on the GBP overnite.......1 progression on the break of a previous high at 2.0298.

I just received an e-mail from FXTradepro now saying he is going to have to charge everyone to use his EA as of January 1st,2008! If everybody remembered in post #36 Scott the moderator asked him this: And he responded by saying he wasn't going to charge people for using it. I don't know about everyone else, But this has turned into an obviously blatant self promotion in my opinion. Dan, if you feel your expenses for keeping your website running (which in not an elaborate web site by any means) warrants you charge everyone a $249.00 a year subscription fee, you can keep it to yourself. Please remove me from your FXTradepro forums and do not send me any more e-mails regarding your Ea as I will be sending a copy of this post to the moderators. I hope everyone sees what he is doing and will no longer follow his threads or visit his website.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hello mer.........The email you received was sent to and directed at my PRIVATE FORUM Members and not this Thread at Forex Factory (So Sorry to mention the PF here Scott). As a Member of our Private Group you certainly would have received that correspondence. As you have requested, I have canceled your FREE Membership. Please note that I had every intention of continuing to Post the EA and about the Method/Strategy here, however, in light of your inflammatory remarks perhaps I should not continue. Let it be known that in large part, the Membership of My Private Forum IS NOT comprised of people that have found me here at FFactory and I feel that what I do at the Private Forum has absolutely no bearing on my status here. I have not approached anyone directly at Forex Factory to purchase anything from me and I had every intention of continuing to Post my EA in this Thread. Unfortunately, people like you have given me a "bad taste". I will leave it to Scott and the other Moderators here to decide if this Thread should continue. If they decide it should not, then I will certainly abide by that decision. Dan

I am a member of Dans private forum - and as such have had the benefit of Dans detailed experience with this EA. Sorry Dan if I am breaking a little of your confidence here but I felt it worthwhile. I know for a fact that Dan has advanced versions of the EA as I am part of the testing group. No doubt members of Dans private forum will in time have these versions made available to them. I am personally testing (in conjunction with Dans testing program) an addition to the EA that gives it a further HUGE advantage. And as far as I understood the new version(s) will only be made available to members in the private forum - at a reasonable cost...of which I am happy to pay. Some of you may well be able to build these EA's, most can't, and in my 5 years of full time trading, I have found that many are crap. Dans is robust and professionally developed - and with a proper trading plan you can make consistent profits (even building in a possible partial blowout of your account). Having got to know Dan, I can say that one of the key reasons Dan is charging on the PRIVATE forum is because he is only keen to have those on board there who appreciate value. I think you can all see from his replies that he is a no nonsense guy and he sticks to his focus on the topic. So all the free loaders ...get over yourselves, and either move on, stick around this board for general comment, or join a committed group on the private forum. Tim

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I'm sorry but what part of this statement is not understood? How do you think he gets members to his site, by teasing and promoting for free here, enough said. And Timmy, I am far from a freeloader, I have paid thousands of dollars on EA's and for acct. management services over the years. The point is when someone says to a moderator he's not going to charge a fee for his EA, then invites everyone to his "private" forum then decides to charge everyone, it's the same as self promotion on this forum, plain and simple.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hmm... don't be so angry. The strategy is clear, there are no secrets. It's easy to put this into an own EA. I just have to thank him to share this strategy. The EA is not the most important part of this - just my opinion. Regards - Xaron

mer.......To be clear on this I will say that over the past few weeks some people have added Links from their Blogs to my PF and the response has been huge. I was not prepared for that situation and as such need a way to weed out the curious onlookers from the Serious Traders. I am sorry that you do not like the solution. I really don't think that this is the place to discuss your problems with this. Besides, I am still not asking anyone at FFactory for anything. Let's please move on and let Scott and the Moderators decide what to do. Dan

I've read several posts here from people worrying about the EUR/JPY going so deep into the progression. Here's some information I hope will help. I've spent the past week doing a statistical analysis of this money management system along with the viability of pairs to trade. What it boils down to is that the EUR/JPY is actually the BEST pair suited to this style of trading. HOWEVER, you can not use a 10 pip stop loss. This pair is FAR too volatile (a good thing for the system) for a 10 pip stop. You must increase it to at least 20 pips, and also increase the take profit to 80 pips to keep the 4-1 RR ratio in tact. If you reduce the ratio, your profits will not be large enough to cancel out your losses. The second thing is, if you don't understand the economic news, don't trade this system. After checking the dates of some posts and some charts that were posted, some of you are experiencing problems because you are trading on days before or during major news. If you're unfamiliar with how news effects the Forex, you must start following along with the calendar here on FF, it's the best. To get you started, you should NEVER trade this system the day before a day with two orange or one red "impact" icons on the calendar on either of the currency pair you're trading. The market will definitely range tightly for sometimes more than a day in this situation. Therefore your 10 pip stop will get hit too often, and even though the adjusted ratio of 20-80 might not get stopped out as often, it has almost no prayer of hitting the 80 pip t/p. This is a general rule of thumb, but will probably help you filter out most of those over 20 progressions. Also, you need to understand that the huge USD releases like Non-Farm Payroll will affect ALL pairs. The nice thing about EUR/JPY is it has fewer volatile news releases than a pair like GBP/USD (the second best pair for this system, BTW) so you can trade it more often. Sorry for the "basics" for those of you who understand news, but I hate to read posts by people losing money in their trades when there's a simple answer. Remember, preparing to trade can also mean sitting on the sidelines... maybe even for days at a time.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Almost forgot... one more thing. This progression is robust enough to withstand even the news events with the 20/80 settings on the EUR/JPY... I only ran into one time in two years of backtesting tick by tick data where it wasn't. However, if you don't have the stomach for those 20+ progressions, stay away from before big news!

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thanks Haystack, I guess you're right. What about a sl of 15 and a tp of 60 for the EUR/JPY. What do your backtests say there? Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi Xaron- 15 pip s/l on this pair (EUR/JPY) is also too tight. 20 seems to be the smallest I could use without experiencing too many stops during any "normal" (not pre-news) ranging times. These times include "off market hours" of after NY close and before London open (if the trade doesn't hit t/p by the end of the NY session). Just a reminder to everyone... this is not a trading system in itself, but in essence a stop and reverse that helps you win a trade if the market reverses on you. Part of the success of this progression is that you need a tight enough stop to put you back in the trade quickly enough to capture enough pips in the opposite direction in your 4-1 RR ratio. Just making your stop loss as big as you're comfortable with, or that your account size can handle will not work. Using too big a stop loss will keep you from getting back in the trade in the right direction soon enough. This is a delicate balance designed around the ADR of the pair, and it changes depending on which pair you are trading. I've found that 20-80 works best for the EUR/JPY, and the EUR/JPY pair works best for this progression system. Of course this could all change tomorrow or next week if the ADR of the pair changes enough. As with any system (or component of a system) you should understand EXACTLY what you are doing before risking any real money. Good luck (and of course skill) to everyone... may the pips be with you!

I am a new member but I have been following this thread daily for a while. I thank Dan for presenting his Forex strategy with an accompanying EA. Some here seem to be concerned about the fact that Dan may be benefiting from this in his private forum. Frankly, I was never naive as to think he wasn't. But he has done us a great service by presenting this Forex startegy publicly. This strategy can be tested and traded manually. I vote to keep the thread going. I would not be here otherwise. coldrunner

--- 帖子 #533 ---
The ideas and methods being discussed in this thread have helped me advance one of my own systems much faster than I could have without it. While working on my own system, I've used the method laid out here and made many adjustments, like changing the progression so that it carries less risk and extends past 24 levels, doing a lot of research and math to determine which pairs suit the method, and optimizing the stop loss and take profit for those pairs that I've found are best suited for it. (A word of advice... Dan's method will not work for just any pair with a 4 pip or less spread). Dan's EA was a big help with the backtesting, which I used to have to do by hand. I don't have to tell you how excruciating that is. While some of you who joined Dan's private forum may be upset that Dan has asked you to pay for the EA after January 1st, let it go. He did do a lot of work and if he decides he wants to do this, he's not holding a gun to your head. He didn't solicit in this thread, and he didn't email his solicitation to anyone through FF. This method can be used manually, although you'd have to make some adjustments. You can also do what Dan did and code an EA or hire someone to code it for you... he was nice enough to give you everything you needed to know with the current EA (except the code of course ). He's also been nice enough to respond quickly to any questions regarding it. Just my 2 pips worth... but I hope that this thread remains active. I intend to continue to use the ideas and experiences being shared here to my own benefit... and I hope the contributions that I make will be to the benefit of others... that's what this forum is all about!

Hi Tim, I appreciate your technical/statistical abilities. By far, you have been the most statistically oriented person in this thread. The ratio of average daily range to spread is an excellent approach. However, in your calculations I believe that when you consider the average daily range, it would be an incorrect assumption to use the "mean" average. Instead the "mode" average is best because it determines the "range frequency" or the range that accurs most freqently. Let me explain... Although the EUR/JPY has a ratio of 41.25 (with an average range of 165) and the GBP/JPY has a ratio of 32 (with an average range of 290), if the most frequent daily range over a given period of time is 118 for EUR/JPY and 275 for GBP/JPY, then the ratio for GBP/JPY is higher than EUR/JPY (30.56 vs. 29.50). Food for thought... Thanks, Walt

Walt, I've also done extensive research, math and backtesting on many pairs, and without going into all of the details (which include many formulas, some of which are proprietary) I can assure you that the EUR/JPY is a better pair (in fact the best pair) to trade. Tim's simple analysis is correct... no matter how you slice it, the fact is the more than double the spread of the GBP/JPY eats into your Risk/Reward ratio too much. And if you increase the t/p to compensate for it, even by only a few pips, you only increase your chances of hitting the s/l before the t/p and increase the number of progressions needed for a winning trade. In other words, trading the GBP/JPY instead of the EUR/JPY will only increase your risk of ruin. You are much better off trading the EUR/JPY or GBP/USD even though the ADR is lower. Please read my earlier posts regarding the best adjustment to the s/l and t/p on the EUR/JPY. If you insist on trading the GBP/JPY using this method, you should find a broker that offers the pair at a lower spread, preferably 5 or 6 pips.

Haystack and Coldrunner.....Thanks for the kind words ! Haystack.....You have a very good understanding of the Strategy and your input is greatly appreciated. Let's hope they allow us to keep the Thread going. Dan

I emphatically support Dan's efforts (pay or no pay)... I have benefited from the information shared herein. Dan, understand that there are many of us that want this thread to continue. The information here and in the private forum is invaluable. Personally, I believe it is fair and appropriate for you to be compensated for the information provided, if that's your preference. BTW... what are the new and improved EA features that Timmy was eluding to in an earlier post that he's assisting with? Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Thanks Walt....We are testing a Spread Monitor option that would enable the EA to PAUSE when the Spread exceeds a specified number and then resume when Spreads return to normal. I think the benefit of this is obvious assuming that we can get the function to work properly. So far, so good............Can't say more on this yet. Thanks again for your support Walt.....Gotta run now....Be back Tomorrow! Dan

Thanks Haystack for your advise... However, I'd like to mention that I'm working on applying this system to a swing trader method. In testing GBPUSD I observed that over the last 8 years (2063 daily charts) that there is almost a 50/50 split between ranging days and trending days. For clarity, a ranging day is when today's price direction is opposite of yesterday's price direction; however, a trending day is when today's price direction is the same as yesterday's price direction. Actually the results are: trending - 52% of the time; ranging - 48% of the time. Using the FXTradepro semi-martingale would be excellent for swing trading in this dymanic. The only challenge is the SL and TP. Currently I setting my SL @ 50 or 75 and TP @ 100 or 150, depending on the currency pair. For GBBUSD, I'm inclinced to use SL-75 &amp; TP - 150. This is the potential problem: With a 2:1 r/r ratio I can extend about 5 progressions comfortably before my money management becomes problematic. However, if I wait for two consecutive trend days before I enter a position, then that increases the likelihood of obtaining my TP within 5 progressions. Furthermore, I set my long entry at a support point materially below the day's open if my trend entry order is buy; and I set my short entry at a resistance point materially above the day's open if my trend entry order is sell. At the end of the day, even if I did not obtain my TP, but have gained from a trending position, then I will close my position. Thereafter, at the start of the new day I will open with a trend position with a cushion (support or resistance) entry order. The missing link is this: I need to determine how many times over the last 8 years did any pair have more than 7 or more consecutive ranging days. If I can get assistance with that then I think applying this system to swing trading would be exceptionally successful. I think this form of swing trading with the FXTradepro system can yeild more than 400 pips per month. Your thoughts.... Walt

Haystack, Good work. I agree with your analysis also. I have written the probability formula to work out your risk for any progression ...I think I did this on Dans private forum and not on this one. So you can find it there - it is not hard to use. If you haven't done your own formula (which, from your comments you may have), then you can get it on the private forum. The probability of failure (assuming random entry) for Euro/JPY with a 4 pip spread and SL=20, TP = 80, and using 24 progressions....is 1:66 . Using Sl = 10, TP = 40 instead gives you a probability of failure of 1:22 (this is in fact Dans random risk everytime he trades his standard progression using any pair with a 4 pip spread. Of course Dan does not enter randomly so his odds improve). So you are absolutely correct 20/80 is significantly better. Whilst at the same time allowing you to run Dans identical progression sequence if that is what you want to do. (However the downside is that you will likely spend more time in the market with the EA running...and as you will see from my comments below - there is some advantages to being out of the market quickly.) So there is a major difference. (By the way Walt using SL = 15 and TP = 60 would give you 1:45 so you are have better odds than 10/40 but not as good as Haystacks 20/80) Now of course these odds only relate to a random entry BUT they are also important if we are comparing different progression settings IF WE USE THE SAME IDENTICAL ENTRY METHOD FOR EACH SETTING. It is clear that this type of trading is best employed during uni-directional volatility in the market .... in other words when the market is moving in one direction with good volatility. The best times for this is around the news releases. As soon as the news release is out, if there is a decent deviation from the expected then we get this situation occuring. We wait for the brokers to lower the spread to normal (this is important to ensure that your odds remain the same as you initially built your progression sequence for), then activate the EA. I have built a news trading progression that runs odds of 1:26 with a TP = 14 pips. Now the balance of variables that we can manipulate for these progressions,for me, is this: 1/ I am happy to accept the higher risk (which is actually better than Dans progression - based on random entry) since I will only trade this progression when the news release gives a reasonable deviation from the norm...producing good sustained price action. As a result the real risk is much better than 1:26 since I start my EA in the same direction as the fundamental market movement that the news release creates.... so I have created an edge to trade with giving better odds. 2/ I am in and out of the market often within minutes because of my small TP. 3/ I am able to activate the EA a second, or even third time, within a big news release move. I plan on doing this whenever I close on level 1 of my progression. In other words I allow the market volatility to dictate when I should stop. So I treat the progression levels themselves as a kind of filter. 4. Trading only around the news allows me to plan my week.... I can almost guarantee a profit every time I run this EA and as there are usually at least ~3 good market moving news events each week I can probably get at least 5 runs of the EA. Now my setup makes me on average about $100 per run of the EA. Go figure..... 5. Now here is the kicker .....because I am able to schedule these trades - and I am in and out of the market quickly - it means I can use this account for other trading systems in between trading this method.... and so this method makes my account returns super efficient. So this works out at a return of about 75% p.a., based on the required account size to cover all the progression levels. For some of you this may seem like a small return - but for any full time trader who has been doing this game for real for any length of time - they would be happy to add this little baby to there trading portfolio.... and remember you can trade other systems around this system if you are in and out quickly. Tim

Interesting Walt - I like this concept also. (The track you are following is almost opposite to my fast in/ fast out approach.) So lets consider the numbers. Firstly I suspect that if you do your analysis over a longer period than 8 years that you will find the trending to ranging (by your definition) moves even closer to 50/50. So is there may be little advantage gained in looking for an edge in the expectation of either one of these states being present more often than the other. You mentioned that you prefer the use of an SL = 75 and a TP = 150 using GBP/USD (assuming a 4 pip spread), and going out to 5 progressions. Firstly your odds are very similar no matter what pair you are using a 4 pip spread will give you random entry odds of 1: 6.6 and a 10 pip spread will give you odds of 1: 5.5 . These are very low odds so I think you must have a very good edge to trade this type of progression and/or restructure your sequence to include more progresion levels. But I think that there is some merit in looking at using the EA for longer time periods IF we can establish a decent edge in the market to achieve this. Tim

Hi Walt- I can appreciate your wanting to trade this on the "Ninja beast". At first glance, it seems like it would be the best option, considering it is by far the most volatile pair with the largest ADR. However, the statistics and math don't change no matter how you enter the trade (except for helping keep the progression to the lowest number possible) and how long you're considering holding the trade. In fact, my posts regarding the EUR/JPY could be considered more than "day trading" since sometimes it takes a few days for the trades to close out, even at 80 pip t/p. Not often, but there are times where it would. The fault in your plan is two fold. The odds of risk of ruin are enormous in a 5 progression series, even with a good entry. Again, without going into all of the "mumbo jumbo" that I use to calculate this, you need to know that for the "degree of certainty" to reach 99.9% (as close as you'll get to 100% in real life applications of statistics) in what you are describing, your entry method would have to have an EXTREMELY stable win rate of OVER 75%. Otherwise you will very quickly reach that 6th progression and lose your shirt (or whatever you've allocated to lose. Even with that 75% system, you'd still reach that 6th level, maybe even before you've made an overall profit. In fact, even with a system that wins 90% of the time, you would still hit that 6th level. It seems logical to me that if you have an entry method that is consistently 75%-90%, you wouldn't need to use this progression method. You could just risk a percentage of your account on every trade and let your 2-1 RR ratio and compounding grow your account. The second fault is in your 2-1 RR ratio. It is the reason why the steps in your progression are so large and can only withstand 5 levels. To be able to use this method, you have to use a larger RR ratio and a larger progression level. Only then do you stand a chance of turning a profit before you hit that loss. That's something else everyone reading this thread needs to understand... this method is not a "holy grail". You will lose sooner or later... that's a mathematical fact. The goal is to lower the probabilities (by choice of currency pair, ADR, volatility, optimizing s/l and t/p, and entry method) enough to put the odds in your favor of making that profit before the loss occurs. Conversely, the win rate of the system of entry on the method as it is presented in this thread could be as low as 25-30% and still have a good chance of giving you a positive return before reaching ruin. Obviously, the higher the win percentage of the system, the more that chance of a profit before busting the progression increases. Please understand that I'm not trying to kill your dream, just using my background in studying odds and probabilities to help you with your research. It's my belief, backed with solid statistical study, that the best way to use this progression is to take it out to the highest progression possible for the risk you are willing to take with the money you have in your account (I'll be allowing up to 20% of my account) using a 4-1 RR ratio, and accepting the "small" returns it will give you. No matter how you try to twist it around, you'll never make large returns on this method unless you are trading a million dollar account. I hope this helps you, and if you have any other questions about this info, let me know... Jim

I noticed after posting my reply that the first time you were talking about GBP/JPY and in your last post you mentioned GBP/USD. The concept of the 5 level progression won't work on this pair either (in fact, it won't work on any pair). Everything written in the above post goes for the "Cable" too... except for the fact that the lower spread on this pair will not eat into the RR ratio as much and therefore it should not reach the limit of the progression as quickly.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I want to add this for anyone reading this thread and considering taking the method out to further progressions by increasing the Reward/Risk ratio to 5-1 or 6-1... don't bother. I ran the numbers on this and the take profits on a system like this would be far too large for even the pairs with the largest daily range. Your best bet is to use a 4-1 RR ratio!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Timmy &amp; Haystack... thanks for your detailed and analytical comments. However, can you tell me the amount of times over the last 8 years that any currency pair had 7 or more consecutive days of ranging (retracements)? I believe that the statistical truth behind this question will actually determine the probability of wins and losses. My hypothesis is that such an occurance only happens 2 - 3 times per year. If I enter 50 trades per year with this system and lose only 2 - 3 times, that's a win ratio of 94% to 96%. The key is proper MM. Walt

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Walt- In theory you are correct. However the demon that you are not entering into the equation is standard deviation. I didn't mention this in my explanations because it starts to get technical. To put it simply, even though you may be able to achieve that "degree of certainty" of 99.9%, there's no guarantee that .1% of the time your losing streak won't go to 10 or even 110. In fact, even with a win rate of over 90%, your risk of ruin is still quite large with a progression of only 5 levels after you factor in standard deviation. And waiting for that first or second "loss" to occur in the series before entering your trade doesn't help. It assumes prior knowledge of how long the losing streak will be, and that the losses that follow when added will not be greater than the limit of your progression. The only thing you guarantee yourself by doing this is you'll be waiting longer to enter your trades which may increase the amount of physical time it takes to reach ruin (by waiting to enter you'll take fewer trades), but it won't increase your profits. You're just as well off entering when you get whatever your signal is. Even waiting for that .1% losing streak to end and then entering doesn't guarantee that you won't hit another .1% losing streak right away, only to go twice as long next time without one. If the scenario you are proposing is true, you shouldn't be using a progression to increase your lots during losses. You should be trading fixed lots and accepting the returns you get with the 2-1 RR ratio. As you said yourself, the key is proper money management. You already have a complete system, there's no need for the added risk of increasing your lot size after a loss. Accept your losses and if your win rate is more than 90% and your RR ratio is 2-1 than it's very likely you'll recover your loss in your very next trade. The best use of the method in this thread is to take a "losing" system with a less than 50% win rate and allow you a chance to make a profit before reaching ruin (the end of the progression levels), or as a "protection" or "hedge" against the market turning against you in the short term and stopping you out. Positive win rates of the type you're describing have no need for a progression like this. You're only increasing your chance of taking a larger than needed loss. Jim

Haystack, Great posts!! You are adding real value to this thread! I have a progression that I am considering trading straight after major news releases once I know the fundmental direction of the markets based off the news event. I will set the EA going in that direction...in theory giving me good chance of uni-directional market movement. The EA will simply act as a hedge in case I am wrong in the very short term. However because I do not want to be in the trade forever - I have come up with a progression setup as follows: SL= 13, TP = 14, prog levels = 8 (limited by a max lot use of ~50 lots), trading GBP/USD with 4 pip spread. And I would blow 51% of my account if I loose. I get a failure probability of 1:26 (based on a random entry) or slightly more than 96% winning rate. I expect that trading with the news will greatly improve my odds. Now this setup has less risk than Dans 4:1 reward/risk setup,(ie SL=10, TP=40) since his probability of failure is 1:21.5 (this failure probablility relates to pairs traded with a 4 pip spread, if he traded the Euro/USD with 2 pip spread then the odds improve to 1:66) Yet I only go out to 8 prog levels, whereas Dans standard setup goes out to 24. Also if Dan had a blowout he would blow 65.5% of his account, compared to 51% that i would. So my question to you: Is the 4:1 reward/risk ratio the best (most efficient) ratio as you suggest??? My setup out performs Dans 4:1 r/r at a statistical level - and if I was to do as you say and max out the progression levels it would always out perform it as long as the other variables stay relevant. (And as I have been trading the news for over 2 years I am confident that I can gain an edge during these releases. But this is beside the point.) Your comments please. Tim

Tim- The reason why the 4-1 RR ratio works best in Dan’s method is that it allows your take profit to stay within the daily range of the best pairs and keeps your stop loss big enough to not get stopped out too often during “normal” (not pre-news) ranging, but small enough to “stop and reverse” in time if the trade goes against you. The reason that Dan’s system may not outperform your system according to how you do your calculations has nothing to do with the RR ratio… it has to do with how Dan calculates his progressions. He is choosing to take on more risk as the progressions increase on the basis that he believes he WILL win by the 24th progression. In other words, he’s creating an expectation of a larger payoff the longer he waits for a trade to close. This can also help compensate for any time a trade doesn’t close out in a timely fashion. He makes more money to make up for a trade he might have missed taking while waiting for the current trade to close out. You have to remember that even though you’re losing less money in your system in the event of a “bust”, your profits per trade may also be smaller than Dan’s. That’s where the RR ratio comes in. The adjustments I’ve made to Dan’s system minimize the risk, but also lower the profit potential. I prefer to accept lower returns and keep my risk low… it’s just my style of trading. It allows me to use this stop and reverse strategy while not having to risk as much money (just like your progression does), or it can also allow me to take the progression out a few more steps while still risking the same amount of money that Dan is for 24 steps. Either way, my risk is lower. You have to understand that the failure probabilities you are calculating are not set in stone… they’re general guidelines. You’re not taking into consideration that trading pairs like the EUR/USD with a system like this is riskier than a “normal” trade with a RR of 1.5-1 or 2-1. The reason is that even though the spread is lower, the ADR of the pair is too low to be able to handle a 4-1 RR ratio. Therefore you must use larger steps in your progression to compensate for a lower RR ratio. Larger steps in turn mean fewer levels in the progression before you hit the “house limit” the broker puts on lot size, or you reach your risk threshold, which in turn means a higher risk of ruin. This is what I mean when I say that you can’t “eyeball” a pair like EUR/USD or GBP/JPY and assume they will work well just because they have a lower spread or a higher volatility. There are many variables that you have to consider before deciding which pair to use a stop and reverse system on. And once you decide you have a good currency pair, you must optimize those variables within your control to further increase your odds. My only immediate concern with your news plan is, does your broker offer fixed spreads during news releases? I’ve seen spreads on the GBP/USD get as large as 15-20 pips during news on my broker which would render your plan ineffective… and the spread can remain that wide for long after the release is out. (This doesn’t bother me as I don’t trade the news). Your order probably wouldn’t be filled until well after the spike and well into the retracement (if there is a retracement). Depending on the movement, by the time you’re able to enter even though you know the direction of the market, you may not be able to eek out enough pips to hit your t/p depending on how unexpected (or expected as the case may be) the news release was. In reality this may increase your failure probability considerably. If you’re comfortable your broker and your system meet the above requirements, your method would need an extremely stable entry with a greater than 67% win rate to withstand your 8 step progression on average. Again, I would recommend not using a progression system if your entry method meets this criteria. Even with a roughly 1-1 RR ratio (13 pip s/l and 14 pip t/p) your system should be profitable in the long run and you only increase your risk of loss by using a progression. To sum this up for everyone… in general, any progression with fewer than a dozen levels will need an entry method with a greater than 50% win rate to have a chance of being successful. That’s why those systems don’t make any sense… you already have a positive expected outcome in the long run. Why would you increase your risk by adding the progression method to your trading system? Hope this helps… Jim

Dan, if you feel your expenses for keeping your website running (which in not an elaborate web site by any means) warrants you charge everyone a $249.00 a year subscription fee, you can keep it to yourself. Please remove me from your FXTradepro forums and do not send me any more e-mails regarding your Ea as I will be sending a copy of this post to the moderators. I hope everyone sees what he is doing and will no longer follow his threads or visit his website.[/quote] So, are u angry b/c this EA is the path to ur financial freedom and it will cost u too much? I guess the moral dilemma here is whether Dan should of not created the thread at all...........if he hadn't, would u be better or worse off? I get the standards of anti-self-promotion here, but please, we have unuf newbie info on this site that informs people there is no holy grail.......Dan is not promoting some holy grail system, but a hands-off $$ management TOOL. This exact tool can be employed manually, or even coded personally (with some thought, work, help, etc,) so is paying for this convenience the end of the world? Anyway, I have a few opinions for Dan, but I'll put those in the PF, coz I think that is the best place for it. Long story short, I don't know that I will make this my complete and ultimate MM "TOOL", but I'm glad Dan opened my eyes further to an all not too new concept. My opinion is that the thread should carry out its natural progression (hey, an unexpected pun based on the EA)......if no one is interested in what Dan has to say, then no one will post any longer.......

Hi Haystack, First paragraph comments: ok, I understand your points but I am not sure about your logic... You state that the the 4-1 r/r works is because it allows the progression to stay within the daily range. I always consider the "risk range" of a possible progression setup which is similar to how you look at it. In other words I look at the total range of 2*TP plus the SL (since the trade can go in either direction plus the stop loss), and then I consider the current situation of the currency pair that I wish to trade. I ask myself will it fall within the daily range footprint. However you suggest that the 4-1 r/r works because it falls within the daily range...this seems flawed thinking to me considering that the trade could be taken at any point on the daily range so where is the relevance of the ADR as you describe it. I use the ADR to filter out trades if the price action is close to the extreme of this range only (and volatility is low). I do not accept that the r/r has nothing to do with the performance of one progression set up versus another... since the risk (SL) and reward (TP) AND the number of progression levels are totally related (assuming a house limit on lots and a committed capital). The fact that a certain progression runs 10/40 allows for a specific number of levels and profits(assuming that you are limited by captial). So all the variables are interrelated. I am well aware of the relationship between profits and r/r and the progression levels. I have built many progressions in an attempt to optimise this. Third paragraph comments: Of course I am aware that the failure probabilities that I calculate are not set in stone.....if i did not realise this I don't think I'd be trading now . They merely serve as a basis for comparitive analysis. I have stated this in many posts. I see no problem trading the Euro/USD with my progression setup with an SL = 13, and a TP= 14. This give me a total "risk range" of just 41 pips - so this falls well within the ADR. You say (refering to Euro/USD) " Therefore you must use larger steps in your progression to compensate for a lower RR ratio. Larger steps in turn mean fewer levels in the progression before you hit the “house limit” the broker puts on lot size, or you reach your risk threshold, which in turn means a higher risk of ruin." You are right that the progression set up with a lower r/r will be forced to have fewer steps (levels) but this does not neccessarily make it more risky compared to say trading Euro/JPY. Since a good entry system for the Euro/USD using the same progression set up as with the Euro/JPY will have a lower risk (since lower spread).....if your 'risk range' is within the ADR range of both pairs .... Fourth paragraph comments: I have been trading news releases for a long time - for a living. I have seen spreads on some of my Currenex platforms balloon out to over 100 pips at times!! So I, and the group I trade the news with, are very risk averse around news trading - especially when we are trading very big numbers. But your comments are well said here - however I am only looking for specific set ups where I know the market will continue to move in the fundamental direction after the spread has shrunk back to normal. I can usually find these at least 2 - 6 times a week. Fifth paragraph comments: Good point - is it worth using the EA at all if we have a good enough win ratio??? How did you work out that my progression would need a win ratio of 67% with 8 progressions? Sixth paragraph comments: You state " general, any progression with fewer than a dozen levels will need an entry method with a greater than 50% win rate to have a chance of being successful." Why is this??? Since the levels are but one component of calculating the risk, and the SL and TP (the r/r) will also influence the probability of failure - and in the right ratio can still give a better chance of success with lower levels than 12.... or am I missing something??? Please explain this further (feel free to use math if you need too). Do you use some sort of random entry method, with many progressions, and minimal risk, and with very low profits???? Tim

Hi Tim- I guess I was a little tired when I wrote my reply to you and wasn't very clear in my communication. Let me try to clear it up. You asked me how your system compared to Dan's. When I was discussing the 4-1 RR ratio, it was as it applies to Dan's system... not just in any trade. Just that any ratio larger than that wouldn't work for his system as the "proper settings" for the t/p and s/l become too large and therefore the stop and reverse it is designed to use will start to fall outside the ADR of any viable currency pair, therefore increasing your risk of loss. The 4-1 RR is the "point of diminishing returns" for Dan's system. Also, I believe you're using unconventional terminology. The "RR" I'm referring to is the "Risk/Reward" ratio as most call it... I have a tendency to call it the "Reward/Risk" ratio since that's the order the numbers are listed. In other words, in a 4-1 RR, you're risking 1 unit of your account for a chance to win 4. All progression systems are built around this. I know that you understand this concept after reading the rest of your post... I just think you misunderstood what I was trying to communicate when I said "RR". As far as the number being outside of the daily range, I'm not making ANY assumptions about where the trade begins. Remember, Dan's system is a "stop and reverse" system where the trade can be won in either direction, not just one. Your statement that the trade can be entered into halfway in the range is flawed... the system can stop and reverse at any time and doesn't neccessarily have to close out within one day. You are assuming there can not be a breakout from the daily range in either direction. While this is true much of the time, it does happen and in fact Dan's system is built around breakouts. As far as the rest of the "RR" confusion in the rest of the post, I'm sure this clears that up. I might suggest though that by applying a finite "risk range" as you call it to your currency pairs is flawed. You are imposing your own beliefs on how large a number or set of numbers can be in a given situation. This is impossible! There wouldn't ever be a need for calculating probabilities if it was as easy as dividing your spread into the ADR. Yes, this gives you a good general idea of how things may turn out... but you are leaving out way too many variables to have any degree of certainty. BTW, I'm not doubting your skill at news trading, just making sure I'm aware of all of the variables involved before giving you a "risk assessment" . Even though I'm aware of how news trading works, I prefer to use the news information to help me understand how the market may (notice I said may, not will) react in the long term. Again, this spreads my "risk" to a lower level... see a pattern here? I believe the "RR" answer would also answer your confusion about how the EUR/USD is riskier than the EUR/JPY in Dan's system, but just in case it doesn't, here's how it works. If the optimal settings for the stop and reverse on Dan's system are 20 s/l - 80 t/p on the EUR/JPY and the ADR is 120 and the settings for the EUR/USD need to be 15 - 60 with an ADR of 65, do you see how your risk increases? Even though the Reward/Risk ratio is the same at 4-1, you are approaching the ADR much faster in the EUR/USD than the EUR/JPY. To put it simply, you'll need to experience a breakout on the EUR/USD far more often to be successful. By definition this increases your risk. To have any success with the EUR/USD, the ADR would probably require a 3/1 Reward Risk ratio, which would mean larger steps in a shorter progression... increasing your risk of ruin. As to how I come up with the win percentage on a given progression system... I don't... the universe does. Even though you have an entry method that may help reduce the risk of your trade being wrong, there are still certain probabilites that dictate the outcome in a given number of trials... or trades. Like I said to Walt, even with a degree of certainty of 99.9% there is no way to know how long that .1% losing streak will be. It could be the next number in a progression... it could skip the next number and go out a million places or more... you just don't know. How I'm able to give you a general idea of how much of a winning rate you need is by taking the only constant, which is the number of your progression, and calculate the probablities of how often your system may reach the end. In your system it's easy... with a Reward/Risk of just about 1-1, it's like a coin toss... a 50-50 proposition. And in a 50-50 propostion, you have a 99.9% degree of certainty of reaching a progression of about 10-12. In other words, you will hit 8 or 9 times many times... as you approach that number of 10, 11 or 12 (or 3,743 LOL). That's why your 8 level progression would still lose. In effect, you are flipping a coin until you factor in your entry method's win rate. Now I understand your win rate may be high... but this doesn't do anything to guarantee you more profit in a progression... it only means you MAY be able to withstand a deeper progression for a longer period of time. The amount of each win would still be a fixed amount dependant upon the calculation of the progression. In other words, it may take you longer to lose or "bust the progression". But even this isn't a guarantee. You could bust the progression on your very first trade. This is why you don't want to use a progression component in a positive expectancy system (a system with a win rate of more than 50%). It's like playing Russian roulette... everything may be fine for a period of time... until the bullet shows up in the chamber... which it will. As far as the system I'm testing, it's not a random entry. It's a method of entering by time in the direction of a current trend. I have however backtested the system with a random entry, and it does perform quite well... but there is still no guarantee that it won't lose before you show an overall profit . This is a mathematical fact. Sooner or later that "outlyer" number in the progression will catch up with you... you just have to do everything you can to put the odds in your favor of accumulating more wins before it does. That's why you must optimize every conceivable variable that may affect the outcome. I hope this clears things up. If you have any other questions, please email me through FF as I don't want to post too many long winded posts about specific questions outside of Dan's method. Jim

Thank you very much for providing the EA again. It is indeed unique. Can the EA be applied to a pair twice on the same account? If so how? Can one determine the direction of the first trade order ie long or short?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hello aelimian..........You should be able to apply the EA to the same currency pair 2x on the same Account, although I have not tested it as such. The way to do that would be to use 2 separate charts of the same pair and attach the EA to each chart using a different Magic Number for each Sequence. Regarding your question about selecting direction - You can select the direction for the Initial Entry in the Sequence - Please see Post #30 for instructions on setting up the EA. After you select the direction for the Initial Entry the EA will use an alternating stop and reverse pattern for buy and sell throughout the progression. I hope this answers your questions.... Dan

Hi Haystack, [quote]: "Your statement that the trade can be entered into halfway in the range is flawed... the system can stop and reverse at any time and doesn't neccessarily have to close out within one day. You are assuming there can not be a breakout from the daily range in either direction. While this is true much of the time, it does happen and in fact Dan's system is built around breakouts." Mate I can tell you, you have seriously confused yourself (or maybe I didn't write it clearly). I make no such assumptions ... you do, in writing this. Further more I have been experimenting with this EA for some time now, specifically with breakout methodologys, and am comfortable with the stop and reverse dynamics of this EA in relation to all the variables ....including ADR. [quote]: "I might suggest though that by applying a finite "risk range" as you call it to your currency pairs is flawed. You are imposing your own beliefs on how large a number or set of numbers can be in a given situation. This is impossible!" The 'risk range' (for want of a name) is simply the possible extent that the trade could go in either direction from the point of entry - sorry if the name has confused you. It has nothing to do with my beliefs or anything else you are suggesting here....??? It merely serves to give me a guide as to whether the possible extent of the trade will fall within the ADR for that day, at that time.... as I stated I use it in the context as a filter. You might want to read my post again. [quote]: "but you are leaving out way too many variables to have any degree of certainty." Hahaha....I like this bit. For a start feel free to look up the random probability formula in Dans private forum... it will help you understand the math behind the points you are trying to make. (The formula is accurate in its random probability calculation - for comparitive analysis). I accept that it does not factor in the daily ADR... but I do not see the ADR as big a contributor to the risk as you do. Certainly I am wary of it and use it to filter trades sometimes...but please feel free to add the weighting of the ADR into the probabilities calculations. I think you need to read all the discussion in both forums - we do discuss ADR as an important factor. [quote]: "I believe the "RR" answer would also answer your confusion about how the EUR/USD is riskier than the EUR/JPY in Dan's system, but just in case it doesn't, here's how it works. If the optimal settings for the stop and reverse on Dan's system are 20 s/l - 80 t/p on the EUR/JPY and the ADR is 120 and the settings for the EUR/USD need to be 15 - 60 with an ADR of 65, do you see how your risk increases?

To have any success with the EUR/USD, the ADR would probably require a 3/1 Reward Risk ratio, which would mean larger steps in a shorter progression... increasing your risk of ruin." Sorry, no confusion on my part with what you are saying, below is the math behind what you are trying to describe. I think the spread is set by the brokers (in some degree) relative to the volatility of that particular pair - hence the spread could be a (partial) surrogate for the ADR of the particular pair. (But as I point out in a previous post [talking about the 'risk coefficient'], that is not that accurate, and the coefficent shows Euro/JPY as much better in terms of ADR to trade. So I agree with your comments with regards to which pair(s) are better to trade....but from a different perspective: Your theorectical probability of failure for the Euro/JPY with SL = 20, TP=80, spread = 4, Levels = 24 you would be 1:66 . For the Euro/USD the probability of failure using a SL = 15, TP = 60, Spread = 2pips, and Prog Levels = 24, would be 1:45 (This assumes random entry for both, or entry using the same method - for comparitive analysis.) So obviously you require a change in the progression levels and an increase in your risk of ruin as you say. And certainly the ADR might have an influence on the trades - and this might be a high possibility if you were to take your trade towards the extreme of the days range. (These probabilities are fact....just like tossing a coin, albeit theorectical, since in a real world where, as you mention, chance can make you a big profit or a big loss from the moment you begin trading this system.) I guess at the end of the day, all else aside, I accept your arguement that ADR will influence the trade risk to a lesser or greater degree, depending on the combination of the variables for the system setup, that you employ. So lets move on. Tim

Hi, I was wondering if I was allowed to indicate my disquiete over the way this Dan fellow has used these threads and FF to gain a bit of 'market' for his EA? I only joined his thread a couple of days ago with a view to assessing the system. I was welcomed and visited the site that looks much under-used. The next e-mail says 'I can't afford you people, you have to pay'! I wasn't aware that sites were so costly. My hobby is music hall, a UK historical music genre and have a site at a small cost to myself but a great service to others - excuse me getting off the point. Today comes the next e-mail offering a 'life-time' EA for even more money. I have expressed my views in a private e-mail to him using a couple of what I believe to be American expressions indicating the composition of the inner body, ie what he is full of. I apologise if this post is considered out of order by the Mods and I will understand if it is removed. Phreddy None of the above detracts from the EA itself.

(The formula is accurate in its random probability calculation - for comparitive analysis). I accept that it does not factor in the daily ADR... but I do not see the ADR as big a contributor to the risk as you do." Tim... I already understand the math behind the points I make, "mate". I have been calculating probabilities in real world situations for over 20 years quite successfully. In fact, I sometimes use my abilities as a consultant in areas like the gaming and insurance industries. The reason I don't post all of the calculations is this is a forum for forex traders... not a forum for differential or integral calculus. I think it benefits the reader if I use general terminology and explanations that won't put them to sleep. If I remember, you're the one who didn't understand how to figure how much of a winning percentage an entry method of a system would need to reach a certain progression level. I had to help you see this about your own system you're considering developing... so please don't lecture me about math by pointing me toward a high school algebra formula. While I'm glad to see that you're applying your knowledge of math to your trading, and even questioning the answers that I'm giving you, you must understand that your insistance to ignore certain variables of the trade that can affect its outcome will quickly be your demise. If you can not accept that the pair with the lowest pip spread is not automatically the best pair to trade in a stop and reverse progression, then there is nothing I can tell you and no calculation I can perform that will make any difference. Your "failure probability" calculation is only a way of showing a stop loss will be hit faster because the spread is larger. It's only one small part of an analysis, not the complete analysis. It CAN help rule out whether a spread can be too large to be successful in Dan's method, but it CAN'T tell you how a given currency pair may perform. It's a fine first step in deciding whether a pair is worth investigating further or eliminating as a choice to trade... but that's it... nothing more. Let's be responsible... your treating it like it's the answer to which pairs to trade could cause someone reading these posts to rush to judgement and lose A LOT of money. And finally... any practical application of a mathematical progression (not just the one we're discussing here in this method) is NOT a closed system (and by system I mean "universe", not "trading system" so there are no more misunderstandings about terminology). If they were, then companies wouldn't need mathematicians and statisticians to perform risk assesments. Even something as simple as a coin toss isn't without variable risk. Is the coin unfairly weighted? Does it have two heads or two tails instead of one of each? Without using your ability to think and consider the variables you are heading for disaster. And the ADR is one of the first variables that needs to be considered when selecting a currency pair to trade so that you can be sure your intended trading method even has the slightest chance to succeed. This goes not just for Dan's progression component, but for any complete technical trading system too. What do you think banks and other institutional traders are doing when they trade pivots??? To put yourself in the best position to benefit from Dan's method in the short term, you have to start thinking very carefully about what else may affect the "universe" of the trade... some of which I've described in my previous posts. There are far too many besides the entry method and you shouldn't be so quick to discount them. The more you take into account, the better your odds of still having a profit once you reach ruin with this progression. Otherwise, just save your time and enter randomly and let the math catch up with you... in other words, take your chances. I hope you'll consider what I've written in this post to be for your own (and your money's) best interest. If not, go back and read post #528 and see what got me involved in this discussion in the first place. I'm not trying to get into a p!ssing contest with you here... that's why in my last post I offered to answer your questions through email... just trying to help a fellow trader. Best of luck (and skill) to you in your quest to refine Dan's method to fit your trading. Jim

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Haystack, Look, I am sure your 20 years of statistical consulting puts you in good stead to make the statements you do. I have been trading for nearly as long and for a number of these years I have lived full time off my trading income. I have learnt never to treat this game as black and white. So again your assumptions about how I treat this progression system are incorrect - I do not ignore other variables, I just look at them differently from you. For a person who obviously has a lot to offer - you are too wrapped up in your own sense of superiority, arrogance, and your patronising approach to the discussion makes it difficult to learn anything from you. It's a shame because as this is the way I make my living - I am always interested in learning more. Tim

Hi FXTradepro I read thru yr thread and am quite intriqued by yr trading tool. Can I check if you use the same settings for ALL your currentlly observed pairs for trading? ie takeprofit=40, stoploss=10 ronaldosim

--- 帖子 #563 ---
What if you only increased your position size enough to get back what you lost in stop losses plus the original amount you would have made on the first trade had it worked. your rr would be a bit out of wack but this would greatly extend the # of times you could reverse, thus length of time to blow up. I don't have access to a spreadsheet, could someone do this and see how many progressions we could get this way. I hope this makes sense thanks wdbaker

--- 帖子 #564 ---
how about make it a "aways in" system? i mean just enter at any random time and let it go for the rest of your life, is there a way to make a EA and check the results? also instead of TP at 40 , how about when it hit +40 you change the SL 10 pips away again humm it may generate tons of signals right? im trying to fidn a way to check the results, is not easy since im a vttrader user

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Helllo wdbaker....I have looked at what you suggest in the past and found that it does not really help that much. Also, I prefer to profit a bit more the deeper I get into a Sequence. There are many ways to play this and feel free to PM or email me if you want a copy of the FXTradepro Manager Calculator. Dan Hi hazz......In my experience it is not a good idea to trade this concept as an "always in the market" system. The Strategy will lose that way although it will likely win much of the time. The key to this Method is entering a Sequence of Trades at a time/place that attempts to avoid a tightly ranging market. As an "always in" system, you cannot accomplish that. Dan

Hi Dan, Than you very much for sharing your strategy and EA. I came across this thread just yesterday and took me few hours to completly go through the entire thread (skipping some here and there). I am new to trading and forex. I always wanted to develope a strategy which does not depend on the trade direction. I tried couple of anti-martingale based automated trading strategies of my own but was not successful. I started beliving this type of trading (ignoring the price direction) might not be possible at all... FORTUNATLEY I happend to see this thread and learn lot of things from here. I did not download your EA as of yet but will do so tomorrow and start using it in demo. Once again THANK YOU for sharing this strategy.

If anyone is still interested in this Trading Strategy - I have been Trading EURJPY with a 30 Pip SL and 120 Pip TP with very good success using the Standard progression Sequence up to a maximum of 20 levels. So far I have not had a Sequence exceed the 9th level and I have been finding the set-up to be very low stress. Most Sequences have been closing well before the 6th Entry. This concept should appeal to those more interested in Swing-Type Trading Method.s If you want to give the EA a try please contact me via Email or PM. Regards, Dan

I have been using the same probabilities on a break and bounce. I would have 2 to a max of 4 trades a day. Usualy around 2 trades. I use the same concept. I have a lot size for an entry and increase the lot with each winning trade. The loosing trade lots stay the same. What I am looking for is 2 winning trads in a row. Its not a large account growth but steady growth with minumum risk. I think the problem with this system is the entry. I see no real method of getting the trade. I would love to see an AE that would do my style and mabe be more aggresive doing more trades.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi, Can you expand on your methodology. For example, how do you define your break or bounce point? What is your factor that you increase lot size by after each win? Do you currently set the orders as stop and reverse (on the bounce failure), and follow on orders for the break win (assuming that your trade setup for that day was for a win on a break)???? Does your second trade reflect the break or bounce success of the first trade? etc etc. What are your (live?) results like and over what period??? Thanks Tim

With North Finance you must use a LARGER Stop than 10 Pips. They require a SL of 10 Pips + the spread. This is a limitation of their platform. If you use a larger SL then your TP must be changed to 4x the SL to use my Standard Lot Size progression. For example a 15 pip SL would require a 60 Pip TP. Dan

i love the sysytem i do have one modification though i would have a start over point.... for example i wuold go back to trade number 1 after 10 consecutive losses.... i would suck it up and take a loss and start over if i never got a win aand was on my 11th trade.... in other words i view 10 losses as a big stop loss..... just a thought.... or maybe i would at least lower the lost sizxe after 10 losses or else its too risky

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hello dagoods...........Interestingly, I am now also using a modified version of this Strategy that Trades to the 7th Level and takes a loss there (similar to your idea) if the TP is not hit. This is in addition to the Original Method. I will send you an email with some additional information about that. Dan

--- 帖子 #585 ---
look forward to it...also i would think this method would work much better on a trading startegy that actually has a better than 50% success ratio...for example any of the trading methods that recieve five stars on forex factory... in the trading systems section...then you could bve reasonably assured that you wont get 10 losses in a row unless there is an anamoly of the method like 1 in 100 times and hopefully by that time you have banked profits and taken plenty of money out of your trading account....also i think maybe it works better on scalping methods with tight sl and tp since most of us dont have unlimited bankrolll..... but the key is to use it with a good strategy rather than flip a coin or a losing strategy with a negative expectation to begin with... no offense to the creator of this thread but i dislike his strategy..... seems like it loses more than it wins....better to use semi-martingale on a winning strategy i think.... IMO.... i think a strategy that pust stop buy or stop sell trades is best at or near fivb levels or support and resitance levels then you can bank a quic 12 pips as it breatest those levels or something like that...or just use nicotinas strategy or auslancos but those both have BIG stop lossess so maybe they are not suited for this...but the point is that it may work well with a winning strategy....maybe an ema sma cross strategy or something..something that is 51% to win at least and NEVER has 10 losses in a row on 10 year backtests on ea.....my 2 cents ....make an ea and send it to me so i can get filthy rich will ya!

--- 帖子 #586 ---
If you've actually read through this Thread you would understand that I do not use or recommend a RANDOM Entry criteria. I agree that any good Trend Following method should work well with this Strategy. Dan

--- 帖子 #587 ---
ok dan thanks for the correction.... was confused i guess at what i read... my apologies... may we inquire as to what your best set ups are then?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Dan, Why bother with reversal entries, if you use this with trend following? Just take only the entries that go the direction of the trend... adding position sizing and reentering after stopouts.... exactly the same as Jacko's AH method but with semi-martingale size. ??thoughts??

--- 帖子 #589 ---
jackos? dont know that one you have a link? what strategies do you have that have at least 60% win ratio over time consistently?

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Your idea has some merit tdion and this concept can work, however, I have found that the Stop &amp; Reverse aspect of my set-up works better for me as many times the market reverses unexpectedly. Really, what I try to do is to enter at a time and place where the Pair has the ability to hit either the Buy Target OR the Sell Target within the Trading Day. This means that I pay attention to the ADR as well as what appears to be the prevailing trend. This Method enables me to be wrong on direction and still end up in profit. Right now I am playing with a set-up that does not exceed the 7th Level in the progression, win or lose. I am using a much wider SL &amp; TP than the original concept and my risk of blowing an Account is diminished. This set-up enables me to Trade with a much smaller Account size and provides much larger Profits per Sequence of Trades. This means that I need to win 3 out of 4 Sequence of Trades to remain profitable. If anyone is interested in that idea please PM or email me. Dan

I'd like to hear more about this entry criteria of yours

--- 帖子 #593 ---
So would I .....

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hello Gentlemen......My Entry criteria is an "always evolving" matter since I rely primarily upon Price Action and S/R Areas. I do not believe that a technical signal exists that would be as reliable as my own 2 eyes. I trade what I see. Of course, this is my personal opinion. Remember that I am not trying so much to determine the trend or direction as much as I am attempting to AVOID a fairly TIGHT Range. This is essentially a BreakOut Strategy with a few twists. At this point, I am Trading this method to a maximum of 7 levels, win or lose and I am using a TP to SL Ratio of 4:1 (ie: 30 Pip SL / 120 Pip TP or 20 Pip SL / 80 Pip TP depending on the Pair and considering ADR etc). I focus not so much on whether my initial direction is correct but rather that the Pair being traded has room to move either up or down to one of the specified target areas. So S/R areas are important as a way to measure (along with ADR) just how far the currency can move in the day. I also have been looking at a Multiple EMA (3,5,7,9,11,13 &amp; 21,24,27,30,33,36 &amp; 55) set-up that I like that assists me in reading Price Action and I continue to use S/R zones as a guide as to whether my targets can be reached. It's a bit more art than science, however, these things are working for me. Dan

This is the first time I read this thread. But the system isnt new to me; in fact, I already have done just the same last Apr as posted in this forum. Martingale is an exercise in "Extreme" Money Management to be successful. You can expect 100% chance of win everyday as long as you practice Extreme Money management. Your return is small but consistent; to make $20-$60 a day, you will need an equity of at least $5K and a broker that allows 0 Hedged Margin . Hmm.. 20~60 a day on a $5k account? thats not bad. After a month, thats $400~$1200 on a $5K; a lot easier/safer than full hedged carry trading.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Thanks for the contribution BK......Regarding the Original Method discussed in this Thread I completely agree with you. I have traded the 24 Progression Level Strategy for almost 2 years with very good success. The only issue I have with it is that it requires us to have a fairly large Account with our Broker (to make a decent full-time wage) and in light of the many issues regarding Safety Of Funds with these Brokers I have modified the Method to a much more aggressive set-up. This aggressive set-up requires much less funds and trades the Stop &amp; Reverse concept to a maximum of 7 Levels, win or lose. Generally speaking, if you can Trade the concept to 4 Winning Progressions for every 1 Losing Progression, you can be profitable. I traded the 7 Level set-up for the past month and was able to double a $10K LIVE Account in that period. Dan

One last thing I forgot to mention: Broker will love you for doing this! You are placing so many BUY and SELL positions each day, they are collecting a lot of pips in spread, they will make you #1 valued customer! Now either that is good because of the pips they earn, or bad because you are always making money out of them. Im still reading this thread from the start, and am currently at page 6 where my Hedged Martingale was mentioned. Yes, my system was using Hedge and closes all only when it hits profit. The reason for this is the Margin. As you'd see, some brokers offer 0 Hedged Margin: ie if you have 1 Lot Buy and 1 Lot Sell, you use 0 margin/equity in maintaining those two positions. The problem with Hedged Martingale however is that the Lot size in the the sequence grows a lot faster than FXTradepro's sequence. I personally havent dont extensive study into FXTradepro's martingale system but comparing the lower lot size growth curve, it appears that FXTradepro's have better control of equity. I now remembered why i stopped doing my Hedged Martingale: 1) I dont have a full time computer. I had it running around 2AM EST until it closes. 2) My broker then, Royal FX (RTFX) would not allow me putting a BUY/SELL stop orders near news time, so it thwarts the whole system! 3) I closed that account - I was in need of money. $2500 -&gt; $2900 after 2 months; not all profits from doing the Martingale though. I had a script instead of EA. Reason: EA croaks when your connection to broker is interrupted; while scripts will continue running.

Sure no problems, I have a moto, help others to help yourself... giving is better than receiving (in the right context ) For me... I'm sorry but I don't to want to take attention away from the thread... but it has to be said... and it shows your true colours... and as much as I would not like to help you and if I could... I STILL WOULD. But anyhow... for the peeps... keep an eyeout... I will try to get the code done for this and will leave you guys to it in another thread. Dan/All... Have a great christmas and new year. Regards, Guess

Each system has its flaws. This one and all the other Martingale type system flawed when that single last trade occurs to kill you. FXTradepro suggest to have enough equity to trade up to level 24. If you lose on Level 24, then it suggests that you lost all 24! What is the chance of losing 24 straight trades? The odd is 1 in 2^24 or 1 in 16777216. Its 1 in 17 Million ! How unlucky can you be to be this unlucky? As unlucky as someone lucky to win the Slot Machine or Lottery. Of course, 24 levels will require a huge amount of equity; you may want to be more conservative with the lot size growth curve.. Buttom line of this strategy is to keep trading until you win (no matter how small that will be).

Bk, The Lucky 7 set up FXTraderpro uses now and refers to below uses just a 7 level progression that results in about equal wins on each of the 7 levels. Its assumed of course that the seventh bet will be lost occasionally but now the average win is huge in comparison. I like how he attracted a lot of interest through his kindness and got people statistically brainstorming to refine things to the point of this Lucky Seven. He's obviously a businessman too and has expressed his ability to sell his ea. Nothing wrong with that after he's given a lot. I'm a directional trader but'll try the stop loss, target price and progression he's using with my trading to increase my average win and motivate me to make quality trades for more doe! Merry Christmas Everyone!

Hi Dan I am interested in your ea. Can you email to me, so that I can forward test it. Or can you give me to your private forum?

In an effort to end this Thread on a more positive note, I would like to share an email I received today from a Member here at Forex Factory: It is comments such as this that has made the time I have spent here worthwhile. The discussion regarding the Strategy will continue BUT not at Forex Factory. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you would care to participate. This is my final Post here - I wish everyone well...... Dan

This message was posted as a report by Gridtrader : Reason for reporting: Please delete Additional report notes: In respect to the other trader FXTradepro and via our conversations of late, I would like to request that from this post forward be removed from the thread. Him and I have solved the mishap and have found the culprit that created these unfortunate posts to occur. Please except my apologizes. I do not want to discredit FXTradepro, nor would I want that to be done to me. Thank you in advance. GridTrader I am posting this report, because so much damage was done to FXTradepro and caused him to close his thread when the accusations were not true.

THANK YOU SCOTT - For Posting this..... Dan

Hi Dan, Your idea looks very very good. I know that martingale will always kill you but your original system stops at the 24th entry. We have theorically a 1:17million possibility to face this unlucky event (not considering the more possibilities gave by using appropriate trading system). Not bad, but it will be profitable? If we have a 1:200 margin on a 7000€ account we can estimate an average of profit. I suppose it is about 10€ per trade. I follow your instruction as displayed on post 25. How much trade does we win to cover the -3115€ loss if we lose one hypotetical 24th final entry? 3115€ / 10€ = 312 trades If we win all trades at the first target (earn per trade: 4€): We need to win 780 trades to cover a one big bad progression. But this is the worst condition ever! You see I need to win almost 312 trades (it's an average!!!) to stay on break even. I'm very interested to try out this system and i wanna be helpful, can you send me the full original "24th entry" EA and the "7th entry" EA to me with a little explaination of your "7th entry" system? Thank you very much, Retal1ator

My Friend, May i test your EA, sent to me; trintoro@gmail.com . thanks

I no longer Trade this Strategy - Although I was very profitable using this Method for several years. I now Trade a Manual Strategy which I developed which is much safer and does not utilize any Martingale money management. Please feel free to email me if you want to know more about that. Regards, Dan

Come on?? What this guys been doing here has to be a banning offence? Constantly fishing for people to PM him so he can direct them to whatever site or service. Im going to flag him anyway so that the mods can have a think. Profitable for several years but your still trying to sell stuff? Oh my. Love and kisses, Leon PS, In the above post he says hes been profitable with this method for several years, but at the begining of the thread he says only one year.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
People like you are the reason I no longer spend much time at Forex Factory, Leon. If you have nothing more constructive to add then I suggest you keep your opinions to yourself. I do NOT fish for people to PM me - Many Members here have come to me on their own. This thread had been CLOSED by me many months ago. I have no idea how or why or by whom it was reopened. I simply find that responding to someone when they ask a question of me is the RESPECTABLE thing to do. I have nothing more to add and suggest to the Mods that this Thread be CLOSED again. Dan

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I never asked you to add anything, bye. The reason many people have come to him on their own is because they trust and think he is the man who is going to make their dreems come true. And him &amp; I both know that he cant do that for them. To everyone in the Factory, please use your head a little. This guy stinks.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Ma man, what do you need to do to make this indicator work on a MT4 demo account?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Did I miss the section in this thread where you guys talk about the spread? If you buy at 1.3000 with a TP at 1.3040 and SL at 1.2990, when price goes down to 1.2990, depending on if you use the bid or the ask, the buy order will close at 1.2990 and the sell order will trigger at 1.2988, or the sell order will trigger at 1.2990 at which point the buy order will terminate at 1.2992. The problem there is if price goes back up, it's going up on a sell order, but price never even touched 1.2990 so you should not even be short right now. I don't see how you won't lose 2 pips on every "leg" of this system. (Assuming EURUSD with 2 pips spread)

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Bump for answer to this question?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
bump for answer to that question

--- 帖子 #624 ---
You are a bit confused. If you are currently LONG @ 1.3000 and the BID price goes down to your STOP LOSS level of 1.2990, your STOP LOSS order will be executed @ 1.2990 and your new SHORT position will be executed at the same BID price of 1.2990. There is no loss on the trade due to the spread.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Thanks for the reply. You're right. I don't know why I didn't realize that there's no loss on the spread until I read your reply. Each time you're just buying or selling more than the previous time. I think I was confusing it in my head with a similar strategy that involves simultaneous buying and selling and DOES have a loss on the spread at each leg. Thanks for pointing out my error.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi, can I ask you, what was your maximum open possition? I mean, which level in tab did you achieve?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I'm interested in this if you still check this thread ever

--- 帖子 #628 ---
For all intents and purposes, this strategy was devised during the times when EURUSD seldom move more than 60 pips a day thus the TP of 40 pips and SL of just 10. Nowaways, we commonly see 150pips daily range; having 40 and 10 will be both too conservative (for the 40 pips TP) and too aggressive (for the 10 pips SL). It should be increased for today's condition.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
I was running some simulations with a variation of this strategy on futures. It gets super expensive very quickly. One poster said they did it with the YM... I'm curious how because if you start with 1 contract (the lowest possible), at level 10 you will be buying 20 contracts and at level 20 you will be buying 263 contracts (and 655 at level 24).

--- 帖子 #630 ---
bump for discussion of this strategy in the futures market

--- 帖子 #631 ---
this is a crap system, i tell this so that new comers don't waste time here. this system can be successful, but key is not this dumb martingale of 20+ steps. key is to fine-tune EVERY entry. use a technical indicator/filter to determine next entry's direction. and if 4 or 5 steps still losing, stop it. and 1 lose kills many wins. one cannot just stop and reverse, one can easily stop and reverse to implosion. dumb system, again.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I wanna know what happened to the "Lucky 7" sequence of trades? We have gone from a Lucky Seven to a Lucky 24?! I'm laughing so hard it hurts Better yet it can be yours for $19.95 a month

With Labor Day coming up this weekend I've spent the last couple of weeks reading and catching up on the different forums. A lot of traders are whining about ea's not doing well and they're all upset. Well, duh, try taking the summer off like the big boys do and you won't have ea trading issues and losses. I'll get back to trading a week from Tuesday and the ea's I use will be performing with profits until next summer starts. So, if you guys can't think of any ways to fix the low summer volatility, then crawl back in your holes and stop biting the hand that feeds you.

I used a similar technique with the rulette...it works because it's a smoother martingale (it's not doubling lots every time).. Yes...virtually it works and perhaps markets are a little bit more predictable then a roulette...the only advice that i want to give is: 1. To trade this you need a very big capital (you will never know when you will have a gain)...with a big capital you will win in the long run... 2. You need a " heart of stone " when you have to trade 65 lots (not if you have a 1.000K capital ) 3. If you want to trade this... NEVER change the martingale sequence Just my opinion

--- 帖子 #635 ---
What is your technique that you use ?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Has anyone tested this system ? I found an other indicator in a differant thread

hi i appreciate if someone who have system calculator in post #116 send it to my email china0098@gmail.com i couldn`t download it and it gives some error but may someone have it in his computer. regards shahram

Hy Haystack, I found this thread recently and I found it very interesting but I agree with you that the original progression is too risky. Could you please share with me your own progression that you said that diminish the risk? Thanks before hand.

I posted source code for a similar EA in 'Bet on the Direction', that I named fxRoulette. I'd be interested in seeing the source for this.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I am using this method successfully but closing on pin bars and MA crosses on M5. Much better than normal TP and SL.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Solution: open an account with OANDA ,adjust your lot size to: whatever your budget allows. Start your series with say 10 cents.. Test. Increase. Once you make some $, then put a pack on the side, and risk that. And so on.. Game can be endless, provided you adjust your math. I like the idea of forexpro....actually I believe , MM and position size are the only answer,( not the billion indicators around) ...pick any half decent system, then add a semi martingale...adjust the math around it precisely, with carefull position size...it should make $. Otherwise,without semi martingale, chances are, (if you are good), you will barely BE...that´s the nature of FOREX. It will meander around your stop or trailing stop forever, eating the sweet profits of your last 2 positive trades. My humble ideas, after 10000 plus trades, 10 years...BE..lost time...50 diferent systems tested... Take care..

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Cuchuflito, Per your comments have you been converted to semi-martingale strategies?

Hi FxTradePro, I mean Dan and all Folks on this Forums who positively contributed. I completed reading the entire thread and fair to remark here that while in the middle of the reading, one some posts I anticipated that Dan would soon close this forum and this what happened by the time I reached the end of this Forum. Credit goes to those pessimist and negative remarks some people have contributed to force a decent person to quit. Dan, Please accept, my sincere thanks and deepest appreciation for your generosity on sharing your system, your decency in patiently replying to queries and your willingness to help people improve their trading. Though, Fourm is quite old, however, when I started reading it I had interests in it due to the fact that I also have the similar conclusion in FX Market what Dan has tried to explain to us all. While reading the Threads, I also ran some searches on Google for FxTradePro EA and found a version. Over the weekend and I back tested it with Random and continuous orders. Conclusion: I am sure there were a lot of positive thing that FxTradePro would have shared with us if we have respected his system and his views, which some of us did not. As a gesture and tribute to the creator of this thread, for all those interested I am posting my back test results to prove that what this Strategy has Resulted in RANDOM order processing from 01/01/2007 to 20/09/2010. This Proves the FxTradePro point that the key is when you start your order and for starting the order, this is not the system. This system is to Manage your Trade decision and catch the probability of it with this approach. I am attaching the result here. however, I do not encourage or mean to influence anyone to start trading this strategy with Random Order Processing. I did Random Order Processing to prove that even with random order processing this system has produced nice profit. That means, if we start our Trade with a Nice Trade Signal Indicator "i.e. FxTradePro" already provided that too in this thread. then this strategy can result in profitability. On a final note, I am again thankful to FxTradePro (i.e. Dan) for his contribution and efforts to try to help those who needed. Here are my Back Testing Results: EA used is found and downloaded from another thread and it executes only 7 orders in progression. On Each exhaust I kept changing the Global Variable to 1 to allow EA to keep executing. The Order processing was RANDOM and continuous, that means the moment EA started the Order processing started too, till the time the testing ended. Data used, I used 01/01/2007 to 20/09/2010 data. Time Frame: Is not of any importance as the EA was to keep creating RANDOM orders from start to end during Test. The results: Please find attached. I hope this helps people interested and proves the fact that FxTradePro tries to explain to us all. Kind Regards ForexZAK

ForexZak, I it possible to direct me to the version of the EA you refer to? Many thanks, timhazelhurst@gmail.com

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Yes, interesting system, and that EA also looks interesting. Could you give us a clue which thread you found it on? I can't see it... Charlie

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi, Great thread. Thanks Dan for all your time on this. Since it's been a long time since anyone has posted I'm not sure if you are still making the ea available. If you are, how do I go about downloading it and paying for it. Thanks, jas

--- 帖子 #650 ---
If someone can give a good entry strategy I am willing to code an EA for the lucky7 system. Just tell me exactly what you would like the EA to do.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
You can use my sequencer EA if you want to trade this.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Xaron, very interesting, could you please include a user guide for this strategy or at least the sequence embedded? TBH

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi, I manually trade a very similar system to this with a few differences regarding my entry and exits. First, I only take trades at the beginning of the London and New York sessions opening trades at the beginning of the day and looking to close them towards the end - typically when we enter the "London close" period. I use Bollinger Bands to measure volatility and identify inside candles as my points of reference to go either long or short on the 8-hour and 4-hour charts. I also trade this during event risk. There is a lot of consideration given to the timing of the entries and I only commit no more than 5% of my capital to making a breakout set-up work. I don't just aim for a specific pip target but let my winning trades run (I need a reason to get out) taking into consideration the tendency for highs and lows to occur at the beginning or end of trading day, week and month but I never allow a profitable position to turn into a loser - protect your capital. Never forget you are trading the price and not an indicator, oscillator or your opinion. Let the market (or price action) lead you and be willing to take the trade in both directions. With some discretion and experience this is a very profitable strategy and the returns are relatively high. All the best in your trading. Sean.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Hi Xaron Can you please add, in your sequencer, in EntryOptions entry by price/ma crossover. From down to up buy. From up to down sell. EA should use this entry only as (one time deal) start-up position and do the rest same as for all other types of entry. And if possible EA should not open other orders (i.e. if we trade multiple-pairs) until Trading Sequence has finished on current one. I am asking this because I am trading for quite some time nice MA system and I see this as possibility to improve it and if successful would like to share it with rest of you guys. Best Regards GFP

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Thanks For your Sequence EA. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #657 ---
so how many millionaires have this method created ?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
hello FXTradepro, i have always thinking about a stragtegy like that, using the concept martingale but modified in forex like u did with -10pip +40pip and the lot 0.1 - 0.1 - 0.2 - 0.3 - 0.4 ... i have a question , now we are on 2013 and ur post was created on 2007 so far 6 years, what happen still make a profit or not ? this method can be used on etoro ? and if u have an etoro account can i see ur profile ? thinx for your effort

--- 帖子 #659 ---
yes what happened? the EA is out of date and not working. pleas come back and chat

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Hi, I'm very curious on the track record of this strategy, with some of the excellent modifications later suggested by the members... Is there any way to reach Dan the originator or one of the other members who actually did go ahead with the idea described here, which I believe has excellent promise, so kind of surprised this thread has gone silent for the last 3-4 years ?.. Best, Vispilio
