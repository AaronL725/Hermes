This is a compilation of a few threads and countless of hours of programing by many other individuals. Especially Cobras THV thread. The other thread is Flag Trading the Trend by Divergence. I've combined the aspects of these two threads with a Doda Donchian Channel. This will not be an ongoing thread. It's simply my trading sytem and style and wanted to share. I dont have time to answer alot of questions. Will there be losers yes but there will be many more winners. Trade consistently with lot size and follow rules. Sound money management is a must. For you to win someone else must lose money. In no way am I trying to take credit for anyone else's hard work. I Have been studying and listening and winning and losing money. These are my best odds of winning in forex. Due to time constraints i'm on the 1 minute chart. Trade times US 8-11:30 EST and London 3-6 am EST. I set Buy and Sell stop orders with entry off the Donchian Channels, my Stop loss determines my Take Profit with a 1 to 1 Reward risk ratio. I let the market enter my trade and let it determine my outcome. When I get involved my emotions, feelings, intuition screw me up. To learn more about the indicators go to Cobras THV Thread. I also suggest reading Flag Trading the Trend thread also. I've posted 3 trades from today with rules. I was in the market for a total of 9 minutes for 30 pips today. I have an alert that calls me when conditions are right and I head to my pc. Tired of staring at candles for 12 hours a day. But I think of it as going through boot camp for the last 2 years. Lost plenty of money in beginning but slowly gained it back. One thing I learned when in profit stay in profit. Break even is better then a loss and another trade will come along. Rules 1. Trend change 2. Unity 5,15,30,60 Min TF 3. Retrace or Flag from Donchian Channel 4. Set Order at Upper or Lower Channel 5. Set SL at high or low of retrace 6. Optional Set TP at 1 to 1 reward to risk ratio minus spread or TP at first Candle color change Everything in zip file in Appropriate folders 2 original and new early entry template Please read up on woodie CCI and patterns for entries. The original system is still good if not better then early entry. Use caution on early entries.

I marked third trade but didn't take due to still in 2nd trade

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thanks for sharing. However, IMHO that's a rather busy chart you got there with redundancies that could be omitted, don't you think?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Marked 5 Trades didn't take first trade due to no new lower low but had new lower high. Within trade times and had Unity with 5,15,30,60 min TF. Didn't take 3rd trade either it didn't break Donchian channel and 5 min TF changed

Hi Jtee1, your system looks very interesting, thanks for sharing. Can you post also your indicators set and a template? Thanks

Indicators

--- 帖子 #7 ---
hi, JTee1. thx for sharing. what are these arrows in the chart, they are extremely accurate, do you put them by hand? coz they don´t appears in my chart after install all the indis and templates. bye.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
These are a zig zag indicator and only help me count the waves in a trend the current arrow constantly repaints, until a good move the opposite way.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Once I have 10 pips or higher I get itchy finger. 12.3 pips profit

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I have Script set and waiting for another turn up preset lot of .3 and SL and TP of 12.5 pips

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Market lost momentum. Price usually shoots through donchian channel. Price Bounced of of resistance MR3. Im usually in trade less then 5 minute I got back to even and closed. Was posting and didn't get to script set and got in 3 pips late and .5 lot which i trade same lot of .3 consistently. While this is high probability trading. You must read up on threads Cobra THV. Support and Resistance. Money Management. Psychology of trading. Demo Trade then make decision . Never go live until your confident of what your doing. Or you'll make bad decisions like i did in the beginning. I bailed on winning trades and hung in with the losing trades hoping, wishing, they would turn around.

15.2 pips

--- 帖子 #13 ---
1st trade 12.4 pips 2nd trade .5 pips 3rd trade 15.2 pips

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Nice system! Here's my first day: Should have bailed out on that first trade sooner, resulted in -12. Second worked out better, was in drawdown for a while, and should have taken profit at MR1, but held on. When it hit MR1 a fourth time, I was about to close but by then two red dots had appeared on the H1 slow, so I decided to let it ride. Went down to the daily pivot, where I closed for +41 pips. Trade entries are marked with a check, exits with a X. Could you mark where your entries and exits are?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I marked trades, hope this helps. Your second trade was a little early 4 me but you hung in there. My entries are usually right on the donchian line. Second trade was late, I didn't get buy script set in time and got in 3 pips late

--- 帖子 #16 ---
You take the trade as PA crosses an extension of the Donchian line?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Great work, amazing system... Thank you very much for sharing. The signals seem to be very accurate, I can't believe my eyes! Best wishes to you!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Yes Delage once price retraces I have a script that i set for buy or sell stop right at the donchian extension. It eliminates draw down.It's a drag and drop script.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Well, I'll be darned. I'll try in out. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
tq sharing...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
what do you do when you get in a trade? but the price does not go in your favour but has not touched your stoploss? but the 5 min trix shows that you should exit the trade as it is signaling in the opposite direction?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Get out when 5 min tf changes if the candle is closed when not in Profit. If you could post your example it would help. If in profit their is many ways to handle this close 50% and Set SL to BE to see if trend will continue, because I'm sure u have noticed trends continuing and 5 and even 15 changes opposite. But price will usually move sideways if its continuing and gonna keep going. I will try to find example and post.

Very interesting. I'll be reading up on this and putting it to work in a few weeks. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Just took 10 out of the eur/usd thankyou JTee1

--- 帖子 #49 ---
But I'm a little confused about the template. The one you have on page one does not look like yours. Should I download the indis and build it myself from the one you uploaded? Thanks.... later: I have been trying to copy your template, as the one labeled "1 min thv flag trading" has caused two different broker demo platforms to crash. I tried dragging the indis over, and they look OK, but my THV4MTFtrix shows all green so perhaps I need to adjust the settings. I think I will give up for the night.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Fun setup indeed...very promising, but would you please post a new template that is like your screen shots? The one posted is not yet accurate..thanks! Brian

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Very interesting system. Please post how you get the call to your phone. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Just copied template and here it is.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
You can see from the members posting trades how the posted template differs from your version...the exact donchian settings and an entire indicator is missing from the bottom, among a few other things..just if you want to see the differences. All the best Brian

--- 帖子 #54 ---
First loss in two weeks, broke my own rule of no trading 30 min prior and 15 after news. but i didn't break my other rule of don't move SL.

Golden1 the ravi fx fisher for some reason doesnt load with ttemplate from what a few others have said. I dont use it for this method. I also here that the donchian channel has to be reloaded and I have settings for this posted Ty for bringing it to my attention and hope this helps. If you get loaded could u please post a screen shot for me. TY Sir

--- 帖子 #57 ---
All the same settings just removed some redundant indicators and ones that did not pertain to trading this system and I don't use to make a trade decision. Hopefully this will help with loading issues. New template is in the opening post.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
http://www.toolsfortradingtheforex.com/ One clicker the free version is adequate it will let you see up to six orders on seperate currencies and can close several trades on one currency at one time and flips through your metatrader charts for you. I use this when price is to close to donchian channel to set a buy or sell stop. You can preset order volumes and preset SL and TP if u like. Great for scalping! Happy trading

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Thanks JTeel for changing the template. Forgive me if this is really obvious, but I do not see the Donchian Channel settings posted. posted later: The template keeps crashing my platform. I will try to build it myself.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Here is the pic of new template let me know if you have any issues. Again same settings just cleaned up.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Well, both my thvmt4trix are all green. They do not change. Is there a place where I can see the proper settings? Thanks, Michael

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Even though I don't have the unity thing working right, I just made 13 in eu. It was very obvious that a downtrend was in progress. I still don't know how to work the script, so I did it manually. What I like about this system is we have to wait for a good trend.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Can't believe I'm the only one here tonight. I just figured out how to use the script. Now my only problem is getting the THV TRIX unity indi to show both green and red.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
which currencies you trade ?what settings of donchian channel? thank you.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
E/U

--- 帖子 #66 ---
only E/U?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I just prefer EU but i have traded EJ GU UJ UC

--- 帖子 #68 ---
After I posted last night I did one more. I like this system a lot, thanks for posting it. But I am still guessing as to whether or not we are in a good trend. My THVMTF is still showing all green no matter what I do. Also, the template kept crashing my platforms from 3 different brokers! To get it to work, I had to download fresh demo accts, and rename them to their own folders. I can no longer access my old demos. Three different brokers and I cannot bring up the platforms! Am I the only one having these problems? Could someone please post the settings for the THVMTF "unity" indi? This is all worth it if I can come close to your results. Meanwhile I am doing well just waiting for a trend change, a definite committed movement, pullback, then a break of the Donchian channel. I set mine to 20 as in your picture, but mine has four other parameters. Of course basically we are just taking the break of a previous High or Low on a 1 minute during a committed trend, so we could probably do this system without any indicators at all.... But they sure help!!! Thanks Michael

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi alllivemind, I had a similar problem to you with my THV4 TRIX MTF indicator not working, to fix it I change my ePeriod setting. Go to the indicators properties and on the input tab scroll down to the ePeriod value, mine are set to the following; ePeriod1 5 ePeriod1Type 0 ePeriod2 15 ePeriod2Type 1 ePeriod3 30 ePeriod3Type 1 ePeriod4 60 ePeriod4Type 1 Hope this helps Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Chances are you are missing a supporting indicator. Click on the experts tab in the terminal window. You will see if any errors are being generated. It should tell you which (if any) indicators you are missing.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Well, Thanks for taking the time to help, StLeon, but my settings were already what you posted. There are two windows, one with 60 and 240 TF. I erased that window for now. When I erase both the platform works much better.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks Cypr3ss, I got one error, repeating in different time frames: 2011.05.11 21:45:34Cannot open file 'C rogram FilesTotallyFX MetaTrader5expertsindicatorsTHV4 Trix called.ex4' on the EURUSDfx,H1 I loaded the THV trix on, but it made no difference.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
allivemind your so right! I agree with you if you just trade the 1 2 3 pattern and break of donchian channel. There are more entries and good trades my personal trading is away from pc until it calls me and is a very short scalp trade. Yesterday prime example of a gr8 move on e/u but by my exact rules many were missed but other currencies ej had some gr8 trades per rules. I do take other trades outside of rules and earlier entries off of a 1 2 3 pattern which has been in use forever. But i take with a 1/3 of what my usual trade is. I do and i dont want to post examples just not to muddy the waters for new new traders. This will work on any TF Look at the 1 hour for example with out the Trix indicator and if you stay with 200 ma trend youll do fine. Just not my cup of tea. I personally try to limit my time trading then play tennis. Many feel it's crazy to trade the 1 min. You be the judge, you seem to have a good grasp of movement without indicators which we all no lag thats why i wait for retrace and move again through previous move low. Im a firm believer in harmony of market for trading. I'm sorry for problems your having with indicators.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
There are several Trix indicators used in the THV systems,,,,lots of different flavors. You specifically need the THV4 Trix called.ex4 indicator. See attached. Once you add it, check the experts tabs to see if you are seeing any more error. Also just to be sure.... you are using metatrader 4 ...right?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
He's using Metatrader 5, by the looks of his directory. The mystery of the 'damaged' template is solved!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hey it Works!! And what is mysterious is that I put the trix from Cypr3ss (thank you very much!) and when I brought up the platform everything worked great and I didn't even drag the indi on to the screen! Apparently it just needs to be in the Platform's library. Now I can put my attention on figuring out what are the best trades, lol. Thanks to all that tried to help, as it was really driving me nuts. If I didn't love this system I wouldn't care...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
What is really bizarre is that I had 5 platforms (3 different brokers) that would not even come up anymore! I put that indi into the folders, and now they all come up! Realize, none of these had the indi dragged over to the screen. Thanks again Cypr3ss!@!

Hello every trader What this indicator number one

--- 帖子 #79 ---
3 wins EU

--- 帖子 #80 ---
13.8 pips

--- 帖子 #81 ---
It was basically a CCI but was renamed Retracement finder. It has an RSI on top of it. The red and green bar signals when price is within 2.4 pips of 10 SMA. Read more about it in Divergences thread Flag trading the trend they trade on 5 minute TF. Divergence is highly accurate with trades. He has some webinars that he puts on well worth the time.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
thank you

JTee1, I am very inspired by this system and have a few technical questions: 1. I like the buy script but I can only seem to get buy orders. If above, a stop. If below, a limit. I have tried to change the order type form 1 to 2 and to 0. So please let me know how to do a sell with the script. 2. I would like to know the exact way to enter. You have stated that you enter right at the Donchian channel line. Lets say that line is 1.4120, as it was on a good EU trade this evening. The highest high of price was 1.41199. If I drag the entry line of the script to 1.4120, I will actually enter the trade before it breaks at about 1.4118, because of the spread. Do you allow for the spread? If your spread is 2 pips would you drag the order to 4122? Quite a few systems want to actually break out from the high or the channel. So do you wait for the break or just the matching top? I have been waiting for a break of .5-1 pip, But you have more experience with this. It actually seems to me after only 4 days of doing this that matching the previous high is good enough when all the lights are green. Also, I have noticed that the Donchian Channel is usually a few tenths of a pip above the price high. What do you think? Thanks, Michael

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Michael For a sell stop drag script below market price to the price u set and price then Drag and reverse TP and SL lines to opposite sides then hit ok. As far as my entry I typically set right on donchian for entry. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #85 ---
No trading until 10:15 for me to much news then market may decide what it wants to do. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #86 ---
This is Cad sell and had EU buy. Had wrong setting on EU had first trix set to 5 fast instead of 5 slow. My bad

--- 帖子 #87 ---
When u get a 5 slow retrace i set Entry at lowest low of that trend and wait for market to come to me. I didn't have to guess it showed me what market sentiment is.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
OK, Thanks! I have the script working on both sides now. So just to be clear on my example, if the high of price is 1.41199 and the D channel is 1.4120, you are entering a buy stop for 4120, which is the ask price. The bid price when you enter, which for almost everyone is also the price on our charts, will be 1.4118 or 19, which means you are in not only before the break, but before high is even reached. Of course on sells, the entry will be at or very near the bid price or chart low, rather than a 1-2 pips earlier. This is very counter - intuitive for me, but hey, you are getting great results so I will try it! Thanks, Michael

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hi thx for your support and help but i have a question what this indicator &amp; plz upload it

--- 帖子 #90 ---
hi Is for you

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I had a great night! Made over 40 pips, but took two positions on most trades. I am going to post my first chart, but I would rather post a losing trade as I think I will learn more. I put a blue arrow on the entry. The "unity" was all green. JTee1, would anything have kept you out of this trade? There was news, but light news for GBP, not EU.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi alllivemind While waiting for Jtee reply. Once suggestion would be to watch the entry in relation to the last "high/fractal" (in the case of an uptrend) that was formed. In this case the "high" was close to a significant pivot (R1), you would notice that earlier the R1 level was tested 3 times but failed to cross over. So i would wait for the the candle to close above this line(and confirm the movement up) before I enter. One bit of advice on the THV thread, was to always remember that the indicators confirm entry, but we also need to watch how price interacts with S&amp;R Levels

--- 帖子 #93 ---
*Had a question, but I just found the answer so I erased my question.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Allivemind Cypr3ss has your answer I would have either let price broke The R1 then waited for retrace. or taken an early entry at 1 pip above the 9:28 candle which is the first Green Ret Setup and 1 minute Fast trix green combo. I'll post chart. Early entry allowed a good 10 pips to R1. If you noticed my cad BE a week ago same scenario, R1 staring me in face I was lucky to BE. JT

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I normally Scalp .3 lot trades. On a 123 trade I usually trade .1 lot and is a longer trade. I will normally be in this trade before a scalp trade if i'm at my pc. It's a simple pattern and can be seen and traded on any timeframe. The MTF trix is not a part of this trade but as you see on this blowup it timed the 4 TF about perfect and was the largest initial move. It will usually get you in on 3 MTF lights. I Use the zig zag arrows as my point count and as u can see there is mini 123's within larger 123 but price must break break previous swing and set a new HH and HL for uptrend then retrace or the opposite LH and LLfor downtrend then retrace. This trade is at trend change only. Set script then wait for price to come to you. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Cheers JTee for this system - I have seen many trading systems in the past that basically waited until all timeframes agreed and then entered the trade - and I have been looking at ways to combine this with the flag trading method. This system does it quite well. I will probably trade this system on the 5min over 5 or 6 of the currencies with which I can get the best spread, but I am having success on the 1min so we will see. Why did you choose the donchian entry over the traditional flag entry of +-50 +-10 - it looks like you basically enter at the same time on the 1m as you would get an entry on the 5min - is this why? Have you tested that this is better than taking the traditional flag entry on the 1min? It seems to me either performs okay - which is why i ask. Thanks again mate - you have done well!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I see a set of indies with a template was posted early on in this thread but then there were indies that were removed. Can someone pls tell me exactly which indicators are being used atm and is the template on page 1 the most up to date one being used?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks! JTee1, Are you saying you entered 1/3 (or 1/4, if you entered another .3 later) of your position at the red line? Simply because you went from 3 green to four green at what seemed to be a pt #3 of the 1-2-3? I am going to analyze tonight's chart, which is very choppy. I did manage to make about 18 pips though, using this system. Michael edit: last night looks very difficult to number, and the breakouts don't go far. Just a choppy night, or a good night to take off!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi JTee1, Firstly thanks for sharing a great system, i love it. I enjoyed your post about the 1 2 3 trades and was just wondering what your zig zag indicator values are, mine are set at Depth 12 - Deviation 5 - Backstep 3. Do you use similar settings? Once again thanks JTee1 for sharing. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
StLeon Yes these are my settings. Glad to be of help. JTee

--- 帖子 #101 ---
BJ1 Template on 1st page is template that is all you need for rules. There were some traders having problem with loading so I stripped extra indi's out. But any of the 3 templates will work and all have the same settings. Hope this helps. Happy Trading JTee

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Sarythsaya You've done your homework yes the donchian break on the 1 min is very close to a lot of the 5 min Flag Break with + 50 rule on flag trading the trend. They have just recently revised their rules to take more trades. I have not looked into all the changes yet. Their trades usually have a bigger SL and target then on the 1 minute. I find i get more trades on the 1 minute its more just my style. I also am away from pc and wait till i here the Alert v 17 call me and market is usually in a decent move. I have used pro act charts in the past the proprietary signal they have coincides a lot of times with the 4 tf alert and they wait for 50% retrace and enter. There charts are $200 per month but the trading room with James Harrison was priceless. He has taught me more then anyone. I would recommend them anytime. They have a two week free trial and that gets you access to trading room. Happy Trading JTee

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Jeff. I have Alert v17 now. Can you explain which settings you need to set for the THV MTF to call?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
alllivemind Entry at break of donchian on 123 trades which ussualy have only 3 of the 4 lights it just happened to turn the 4th lite before entry. but I have script set at .1 lot and labeled 123 trade on preset of the buy script. I would set script to .3 lot on next retrace and break of donchian if all 4 tf are still same color or in harmony. If you can send me a markup of what you seen as 123, I'm not sure what currency you were trading and I'll mark it up also. so were on the same page.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks!

Hello, Is this good setup to short? 1 minute chart EUR/USD

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I really like this strategy. I've already made several successful trades over the last week. One thing that I'd like to add, is that I have a separate 5 min chart with the donchian channel on it. This gives me a feel for some more significant levels and waves. Also, if you're doing any kind of wave analysis, I try to get in on the 3rd wave. If its not on that wave, I don't typically trade it.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Doman Yes that is the essence of flag trading a trend. Any TF will do. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Toafdawg always good idea to be aware of higher TF. Are you looking at 3rd wave on 1 min TF or 5 min? Happy Trading JTee1

Thanks And that getting out on B/E was luck of patience or it was legit? :-)

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Jtee. Do you have any stats on your trading this method? Things like winning % and avg #pips per trade. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Nothing wrong with B/E but i stayed in for a win but you got in later for a win. I had already setup trade with 3 lights for a 123 trade when i got 4 greens right before entry. I would've stayed but i've been wrong before. Happy trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #122 ---
24 wins and 3 losses by the rules of 4 lights. I also dont trade daily due to my schedule and I take other trades as well and no trades during news. Ave pip take around 9.7 pips per trade. One trade today on EU after all news, Patience is key. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #123 ---
12.5 pips 25 wins 3 losses

--- 帖子 #124 ---
These trades they would be all wins becouse of huge SL .... Any comments on this?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Short answer yes Huge SL i dont think they are but every ones own perception is their reality. Money management of 2% max SL on any one trade. I'm usually at .8 to 1.5% SL I would have taken first trade 15.1 SL 13.1 TP and stayed for 52 minutes until TP of 13.1 was hit. I would only have taken 1 trade and moved SL with each new donchian lower break i would move SL to new Lower High of donchian. Remember were on 1 minute and going to the well to many times it will eventually dry up. Happy Trading JTee1

I have been practicing this system a while now, and took my first live just now for nice 16pips, it has gone further but I closed on first sign of M1 trix turning green, TP always the difficulty in trading for me so far, but still +16 I'm happy

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Spacepip Good entry. Remember is all this is a set of lagging indicators, price can always spike the opposite way whenever big money comes in. Is all this is is a high percentage trade and we are grabbing a very small percentage of the move. Nothing more nothing less. Practice good money management and you should do well. Stay away from news 30 min prior 15 min after. Patience is the key. I know it will look like you miss some good moves but that's when you get the spikes against you also. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #132 ---
May I ask, what does 3 lights means?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Where would you set up your SL and why? Thank you

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Your charts look like lovely Christmas trees, if you think that you can win using one minute charts and a 1x1 win loss ratio you are going to burn your ass not your fingers. Good luck, cause that is what you will need.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
It does not matter if you have 1x1 RATIO or 1X5 RATIO becouse if you have 1x1 probability of reaching TP is 50% but in 1x5 RATIO it is only 20%

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Doman From what i see there wasn't a valid entry yet on the chart yet. We had all four tf in harmony but there was no break of the donchian channel. Give me a currency and GMT time and i will let you know were sl and tp was and loser or winner by rules. News is always a factor and i don't take trades with news releases coming out from 30 min prior to 15min after. The broker time on your screenshot can vary depending on location of broker, so i cant tell actual time of trade. If you also noticed the mtftrix will become innacurate after several days passing. Its best to track trades daily. I believe rules are very clear for entry and exit on first post, but i am more then willing to help if you get me more info. SL is set at the previous high or low of flag before break of donchian channel with 5min Slow 15, 30, 60 min fast mtftrix all same color. Happy Trading JTee1

I trade FXDD and I trust your metatraders are showing a difference. I have had same template on several metatraders and there would be a slight difference, but nothing to that extreme. Leads me to believe there may be some incorrect data some where on one of the metatraders you have. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Doman Got your private message on trade times on your post. Here's answer I wouldn't have taken trade due to no break of previous high on downtrend then retrace and break of donchian. There was a break of previous high but other conditions were not right. I'll post chart and when i would've took trade by rules. There was no clear trend but I would have been looking for a good 123 entry. Hope this helps. Happy Trading JTee1

7 pip Trade 12.3 SL 10.5 TP Bailed at 7 pips but would've made 10.5 pips

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Thank you for new charts. Each you chart is very informative for me.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
interesting, i took a trade on this earlier, 24 pips was sl i i set 24 pips as tp. But i moved the sl up everytime the donchian channel made a new vertical line, i came out in the end hitting my sl at only -2pips. BUT it did run to the full +24 in the end but of course i was no longer in the trade, so i might not move the sl on the next one and see how it does.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Doman Look at post #4 its very similar to trade we just discussed we had harmony with 4 time frames but we were in a wedge consolidation. We needed a break of previous low and some price movement. Then we got a retrace and break of donchian channel. Price movement is the best indicator we can use. The Donchian Channel is just a visual of where price stopped and retraced away from. Break of channel is just a continuation of trend. Our Sl gets us out when price is making a new high or low going against our trend. The 4 TF harmony is a time when Percentage of wins are higher. All together its just a set of rules to trade by and win loss ratio is on my side. Look at 1 hr chart and break of donchian with trend. Add up the win loss ratio there. patience is a virtue. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Dean Kenny I marked you entry in yellow and entry by rules in orange. I wait for a retrace and set buy or sell script and wait for price to continue through Donchian. Either way the trade didn't make a 1 to 1 ratio minus spread. They both were good trades and in profit. But with that said you were in profit 15.7 pips and 8 pips from target. Mine was in profit 10.7 pips profit and less then 1 pip away from target. I dont trade during news time and miss some good trades but I also miss the spikes which can kill you on 1 minute TF. I posted a trade that was after news. It had a clear move down, 4tf harmony, then retrace, then break of donchian, then profit. It is in post #149 Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Nice charts..Having success with them. Do you have an EA that sets TP or do you just go for one to one ratio? Wondered if you were setting TP based on ATR? Thanks!! Keep it up

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Goldenboy I posted a script i use once i get 4 tf harmony and a retrace I set a buy or sell script. SL determines target. I set sl at high of retrace and tp at 1 to 1 ratio minus spread. Once you drag script onto chart at entry price you can drag tp (green line) and sl (red line) where they need to be then hit ok. I have a preset file of .3 lots and 12.5 sl and tp gets me close then drag sl and tp to exact price. Most trades are in the teens 10 to 15 pips. Happy Trading JTee1

Hello JTee1 ! You did a truly titanic work, bringing together several trading setup. A low bow to you. I trade using CCI indicator at 1 hour time frame, and for the last six months watching THV at 5 minute and 1 minute chart. At CCI, I swing, but sometimes scalping EUR 5 minute Thrix THV. I read your thread on the forum, I liked your set-up for trading and realized what I needed for a stable intra-day scalping because the results of a 5 minute I was so-so, step forward and two steps back. You have a good setup. I do not understand why Fisher Ravi, and just do not understand how to use RSI, for this has removed these indicators, and added his favorite CCI with the parameters 30, which corresponds to the half-hour intervals. There you are http://savepic.net/1499054m.jpg I beg pardon for bad english, translator Google

Daytrader Prior move of 45 pips in 5 minutes would have scared me. I would have been looking for a good retrace which u had on trade #1 But more important i would be looking for a market correction of the news spike before continued move in direction. I probably would have been a break even for me after 9 pips on trade #1. I dont like to trade when market moves that much in 5 minutes. Happy Trading JTee1

If anyone is following Divergences Flag Trading the Trend, just to let you know he has had a rule change and has been entering on the 1 min chart after 15 min confirmation. Its worth the reading and his webinar of last friday is up. My hats off to Divergence he has gone the extra mile for everyone. The 1 Min Chart has always rocked for me short and sweet. I will use his rule of 2.4 pips from 10 MA on second entries within the 5 ,15,30,60 min harmony. Gets you in much sooner. I'm working on a 15 min Donchian with 1 min entry It looks very promising. But I'm still using old faithful. I'm up 8.9 % on 8 days of trading this month. and 10% last month on 12 days trading. Trading has to take second place to Contracting

--- 帖子 #165 ---
There is no only one 2.4 rule. But what JTEE mentioned means you go to trade when the price is as close as 2.4 from Moving avarage 10 in retrace. If it is further then 2.4 you dont take a trade.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I read post 94, but did not attach much importance to him because it was interesting to find out just about trade in the breakdown Donchian channel and because I do not like aggressive entries . And is now studying a branch the Flag Trading the Trends and I find it interesting points that can add stability to the trading. Suddenly they are on a minute chart For two years I use the CCI indicator of trading, and I consider it the most interesting and flexible enough. Parameter 8 for CCI is too short even for a 5 minute chart, not to mention one minute, these are its properties. Too short a time to calculate the indicator will not remove the price noise and light will often cross the zero line, giving the wrong signals to the input. For the 5 minute chart proven over the years setting CCI 14. For one minute chart I picked up the option 30, which calculates CCI over 30 previous bars, a half-hour trend. I use mainly the zero line, zero line reject and crossing the zero line after good pattern(nine grandfather patterns CCI). For scalping enough, but a shorter option will cause the spin as a squirrel in a cage for 1 minute. This is just my opinion. Just think about it. sorry a little off-topic !!! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Greetings Daytrader I rely more on the MTF Trix for permission to trade and see the 8 CCI as just the earliest entry point. I like to wait for the break of donchian channel as entry point. I could never enter on an 8 CCI only. I believe we all can see trends but we have to pick and entry and exit strategy. The 8 CCI is earlier then the 14 CCI and the 8 CCI is usually earlier then the break of a Donchian Channel. They all have there merits and pitfalls. They will help us and fail us. As for my thread it is simply my style of trading that fits my time constraints and has worked for me. I'm usually estimating jobs on my computer and wait for alert to call me. Then i look for entry. I've stared at to many candles for to long of a time. As far as my trades posted Friday in Divergences thread they were based more on his rules and I'm trying to keep with his rules in his thread, but also trying to clarify when we are experiencing a pullback vs a retrace. I believe the mtf Trix will help with this. I've seen failed trades posted while I made positive trades during same time within 10 minutes or so of each other. They bought at what looked like retrace and entry signal was given, but was during a larger pullback. While a pullback was warranted at that time, we've also seen larger trends keep going without a pullback until later. Look at post 4737 by thefallguy on divergences thread and I will post my trade entry. I'm always willing to listen and learn. When we think we know it all, I believe that's when we can be the most lost. Best mentoring I've ever experienced is pro act charts. ( James Harris) Access to their trading room and live trading and a mentor calling what, when and why. Happy Trading JTee1

Hi there. Would like to ask, what does the Green Box which appears on the chart indicate? Another would be, I already set up the 'ay-donchian-channel" to 15m. But as i look through screenshots posted, it would appear that the donchian channels are somewhat tighter? Is the another donchian channel setup? Thanks in advance for clarification

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Patient Pip I don't really concern myself to much with the 1 hr slow and 4 hr fast trix, more concerned with price action as you mentioned. As far as 3 tf's aligning there is definitely some good moves. After watching and charting for to many months, i came to the conclusion that these were the highest probability trades. I'm looking to make 1 trade a day and not chase the market. But let the market come to me. For example tomorrow i know i will be trading between 10:15 and 11:30 EST due to news releases. I will turn my speaker on then and wait for a call for permission to trade. Today I had more time and have been looking at an alternative trade strategy that aligns with Divergences flag trading, but uses same filters as my template but still incorporates my strategy all in the same template. So far it has been very successful with more trades but has a little more draw down. I like a clear entry and exit strategy. Happy Trading JTee1

Yea, I just realized that the donchian was a little different. I have two donchian. One is called ay-donchian-channel and the other is called DonchianChannel-mql-fileM.

Yes, it made it though. My SL TP is set at 15:15 minus spread. I was just wondering if what i did was right or wrong. :/

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Konata Read first post of rules and look at chart posted as to where TP and SL determined. I almost always trade sl is set by retrace low or high dpending on buy or sell, TP is subtract spread from SL and that is your target. This way whatever time you trade low volume or high volume times, the market movement determines your Target. I like high volume trading times. I will post chart of your trade time and proper settings and where entry sl and tp i would set.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
This would qualify for trade it was outside of 30 min prior to news release. I didnt take this one. It was 38 minutes before news release and I didn't start trading until 10:15 after all news releases. If in trade before news and have not hit target 30 min prior I will usually close out trade 10 min prior to release. Biggest issue with 30 min prior to news is price will stall especially 10-15 minutes prior. Then Reuters releases news 2 min earlier then publicized time for its subscribers and this is usually when spikes occur. Spikes usually 5 min prior to 5 min after news. I like 15 min after to see if trend will be affected by news outcome and if it aligns with or against trend. my 2 cents worth, some of you know it some don't. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I know several people have had same issue. Chances are you are missing a supporting indicator. Click on the experts tab in the terminal window. You will see if any errors are being generated. It should tell you which (if any) indicators you are missing. There are several Trix indicators used in the THV systems,,,,lots of different flavors. You specifically need the THV4 Trix called.ex4 indicator. See attached. Once you add it, check the experts tabs to see if you are seeing any more error. Are you using metatrader 4 or 5. metatrader 4 is what u need Hope this helps JTee1

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I trade between 2pm - 4am my time, which is +800 GMT. So yeah, its definitely in the range you specified. Just wondering, i'm using a indicator called "Retracement Finder" to look for retracements. I notice you are using one called CCI? Would like to get a little more info and add that to my chart and see the difference between the two... Thanks

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Retracement finder is a cci just renamed. Take a look at Divergence Thread Flag Trading the Trend. It's normally at the bottom of my thread under similar threads. They have more info on it and several versions you can download there. When trading i usually enter on break of donchian, but if there is a larger pullback I will at times take early entry on cross of 10 MA and CCI cross 0 line going back to trend. I have posted several trades with label of early entry. Hope this helps JTee1

Jtee, I notice you have "20" for the Donchian period. The Donchian Channel indy I'm using has five fields. ChannelPeriod: 20 EMAPeriod: 120 StartEMAShift: 6 ENDEMAShift: 0 AngleTreshold: .32 Are these the right settings?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
BJ1 These are correct if you notice the real small arrows on your chart at the outer bands of the donchian channel. These show up when the Angle Threshold is exceeded. Happy Trading

hi jtee was looking at this one and would like to ask u about yr opinion.... would u take this one? what i was concerned about was 100 pip drop in 1 h and the green was 5M row... //sometimes i think i look at too many things// prons and cons of this trade would b appreciated //blue dotted horizontals are 50's// thx

--- 帖子 #224 ---
What was exact time of trade, just helps me find things quicker and my mtf is showing a slight difference if i'm looking around the right time Thanks JTee1

Patient Pip Retracement Was about 25% of initial move. I would have trade it for sure but I would also managed it closely once i was in. I'll post my strategy for 4mtf with 5 min against me.

JTee1 May be lack of sleep but I am terribly confused why my chart doesn't match yours. I downloaded all indicators (and with the zip files there are boucoup of them!) and the templet on page 1 you say is the current one. Yet when I download it (see attachment) my chart doesn't have the indicators you are using and some other things are missing too. It would help so much (me at least) if you could post the templet you are presently using so I can follow your charts and instructions. I'm a scalper from way back and I'm itching to get my teeth around your system as I know from experience it can be very profitable. I just want my charts w/indicators to match yours. Any clarity will be greatly appreciated!

Dear Sir, Today I had such a situation. MTF area between two vertical green lines was red. I made SELL (shown in the figure). Put the Stop Loss. But then the price turned around and I took a Stop Loss. After that, I changed timeframe on the M5, then back to the M1 and MTF changed color (as it looks in the picture now), three green bands and the lower band is red. Questions: Did you have a situation where the MTF changed color? Do I put the Stop Loss? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thank you.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi! First, you went to the fifth wave in my opinion and the price was 130 pips down, why jump into the passing train Second, do not forget that in one hour 12 candles for 5 minutes, and 60 candles in one minute. Because of this, changing the color of the indicator (I can not answer because I do not understand the meaning of phrases. Russian )) ) Third, see this post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...28#post4723828 this indicator to check the MTF. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Muhe As far as MTF repainting it will on the last couple of candles but not much more than that. Also history will repaint after a day or so but can recreated by actually having a chart open of the 4 tf used and double checked with the actual THV trix in each time frame for past performance. SL is described in detail in the original post, I personally use the previous high or low of retracement and 1 to 1 ratio minus spread for Profit target. On your trade It didn't meet criteria for trade. Also at 11:30 EST or 15:30 GMT US session slows down for lunch and end of london session. I am very leary of taking trade at this time. I believe in previous post i have traded at this time but took 1/3 my normal position. Daytrader UA also had some sound advice 130 pips and trends do end and combination of time 11:30 lunch, whatever system you are trading. Swing traders and Longer term traders may ride out a low volume trading time and hold a position. I'm in and out and looking for 1% a day. Hind sight can be 20/20 Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Muhe Here is what i seen overall. All trades are a risk. Trend seemed to be over, got a bounce off trend line, then broke previous low, then received signal. Market said down 4 different times and i took it. What i did do was leave a lot of pips on the table with that trade and left content and didn't try to over indulge myself. Patience plus lack of greed leaves you healthy, wealthy and wise. It wasn't just 4 red lights and take the trade. Hope this makes sense. Happy Trading JTee1

hi blackstack, this zigzag pointer indicator show the arrows. hope that helps. cheers

--- 帖子 #253 ---
here this morning again, the indicator repaint. so you can only trigger the trade at the red line after the big candle break the channnel and close at 1.4041 and not at 1.4052 the channel break, then at this moment the indicator not show red. but after all you refresh the chart then it looks like wonderful 4 candle before already all red for a go. but the real world is not easy

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Yes the very initial move you very rarely catch and the indy does repaint a few minutes, especially at spikes in price. This is why i wait for 4 tf unity then retrace and then i usually set a stop order while price retraces from donchian and wait for order to fill or not. Rule 2 then rule 3 then rule 4 Rules 1. Trend change 2. Unity 5,15,30,60 Min TF 3. Retrace or Flag from Donchian Channel 4. Set Buy Stop at Upper Channel 5. Set SL at low of retrace 6. Optional Set TP at 1 to 1 reward to risk ratio minus spread or TP at first Candle color change Hope this helps JTee1

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Tritan Last 3 months have been 10% return with a 85% win ratio. I only trade part time due to other commitments and 8-10 trading days per month. I'm working and trying to get a business up and running. Remember wait for 4 time frame unity then retrace and break of donchian channel. Some were getting in at onset of 4 tf unity then it would retrace on then immediately. Good luck JTee1

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Is this correct? Or am I missing something? -edit- Also, the EA seems to alert every second :-/ -edit- You seem to ignore the first rule yourself, since you posted a lot of trades where the trend did not change?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Yes entry was good and exit was good also. There is several exit strategies and that is one of them. Did u have a 1 to 1 minus spread profit ratio at onset of trade? Looks like you were real close to a 1 to 1 win ratio, which i prefer when i trade. Happy trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Oh thanks Finally I'm getting something right here... What do you mean by 1 to 1 minus spread profit ratio? Could you mean that, if the SL was 15p away, means TP at 15p as well? (1:1) Sorry, I guess I'm a little slow. Another thing I'm curious about is, as time goes, say for a short trend, the Donchian channel top will continue to drop. Do I adjust my Stop-Loss to the new lower high, or does it remain as where my entry donchian high was? Also, I notice that THV4 MFTrix repaints when i switch to another time frame and back to M1. Do i force the repaint, or just keep it at how it paints on M1? Thanks

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I attempted another trade today but I think I failed on my SL and moved to BE when I was up +6p. I'm not sure if its part of the plan or is there a strat to prevent this from happening ;P Nothing to cry about. BE is still profit for me. But would like tips/hints/feedback to gain more. Thanks~! http://my.jetscreenshot.com/demo/20110816-leji-51kb.jpg

I took another entry slightly later. This time I held back on setting my BE so quickly and gained 18p from that. Here is a screenshot. http://my.jetscreenshot.com/demo/20110816-xmac-51kb.jpg

(1:1) Sorry, I guess I'm a little slow. You got it 15 pip sl equals 15 pip tp minus whatever your spread is, which fxdd is usually 2 pips so tp is 13 pips Another thing I'm curious about is, as time goes, say for a short trend, the Donchian channel top will continue to drop. Do I adjust my Stop-Loss to the new lower high, or does it remain as where my entry donchian high was? This is the premise of donchian traders, break of outer line and sl is middle line or other outer line. I move to BE at 2/3 of target and always close with 1 or 2 pip profit with one clicker tool Also, I notice that THV4 MFTrix repaints when i switch to another time frame and back to M1. Do i force the repaint, or just keep it at how it paints on M1? I keep seperate 15 min chart open and i dont refresh 1 min chart Thanks [/quote] Your welcome Happy Trading JTee1

Your welcome Happy Trading JTee1 [/quote] Thank you for the clarification! Um, yea, I usually set SL to lower Donchian Channel line, and the distance pip in between entry and SL will be my TP as well. But I TP early when I see red bar, or i move my SL line 5 pips below TP and increase TP line if it is going strong. What are your thoughts on that? :/ So its 2/3 from target to BE. Noted! ^_^ Could you explain what the 15m window does? Thanks again for your help!

Here is another 20pips i took off the day. I waited for a retrace before putting in a buy-stop order. It just shot up suddenly and TP-ed so quickly, I couldn't do anything. 20-pip TP was set because of the distance between SL and Entry = 20p as well.

Thanks non-the-less. On the other hand, does anyone know how to force repaint the trix? I kinda missed an entry of 50pips because it didn't repaint properly when i didn't switch it, but after switching the timeframe to 5m and back to 1m, it repainted so nicely that I would have entered. :/ I'm still confused if I should force repaint the Trix.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
hi konata imho, those few repainted ones dont make dif. of life and death. i recklicked from 1 to 5 and back,,,few differed,,,, there is no system that is black and white,,there is always to judge the look/structure of it.... u never leave pips on the table if u win, nobody knows whats next. time will get us better

Your welcome It's simply one way to trade and probably not the best, but I've not had a month under 10% profit and only trading part time due to other commitments. I'm in and out, happy and content, I owe a lot to Mr. Harris from ProAct Traders. While they have a propriotary Charting system based on 10 min charts. They catch the middle of a move after some good movement. They provide good mentoring in their trading room. He would call many other trades that were not related to their charts. He taught me how to take smaller trades on a 123 setup and as a moved continued I would have gained capital to put on larger trades for free. Best wishes JTee1

Price will usually show some respect. Best trade is with room to move to next level. I will usually set SL at high of retrace but if S&amp;R doesn't give me room to get a 1 to 1 return I set TP right before next level or skip trade and wait for break and bounce off of last S &amp; R or in between level broke.

I Always keep a 1 minute chart zoomed all the way out for clear view of the whole trading session. Gives clearer pic of trend at my trades we had 5 hours of down trend showing on 1 min chart. We had sideways market before US open and market had 3 choices sideways up or down. It took down and i believed it. For those who say you cant see trend on 1 minute here it is. Purple and white is 15 min donchian channel. Most 4 TF harmoniy trades on 1 minute will be on outside of break of 15 min Donchian. With that being said first trade today was not on outside of 15 min' and I would have taken it due to market open but well aware of head fakes at this time also. But price did continue on after SL taken out. Winning Trades were taken with trend after breakout of wedge or flag then 4 TF Harmony then retrace then break of Donchian. Except the losing trade at London open did not break wedge and did not break previous high and was staring into resistance. Inside 15 min donchian. But still would have probably taken due to 4 tf harmony and lower high then break of donchian. A lot to consider but its worth considering. My last 3 trades in green equal 7 percent growth. Pink trade was Konatas in London session I need sleep Red trade was trade I probably would have taken on london open if trading Notice failed trades outside of market hours JTee1 Whew!

I don't see issue with london session. I actually prefer it overall. I've been looking at 1 minute chart for close to 3 years now. To me if you zoom it all the way out the trends are clear. to me you see the moves earlier and can get in earlier and out sooner. I watch that exclusively then bring up other chart for setting script. All markets and all sessions will range from time to time I've got my 1% on a ranging day of 50 pips . I pay close attention to ATR at time of trade and when i get to ATR with TP i get an itchy finger. If SL is 20 due to retrace and ATR 14 i would not let it go much less then that at first sign of opposite movement. Watch S &amp; R Levels draw your flags and wedges on zoomed out chart and it becomes clearer. Take a failed trade and examine it and the reason will usually show itself. Today,s London session prime example still downtrend and in wedge with Resistance staring at you. It did have 4 tf harmony and break of donchian. Look at the new days S &amp; R levels and take them back to the the 18th and you'll see how they were established. Go to a 5 min chart zoomed all the way out and the head on the 17th and shoulder on 16th and 18th. I'm not into patterns to much other then consolidation points and breakouts of them then wait for 4tf harmony. Many will look to more down movement from that pattern but i wouldn't trade it. look at 1 HR zoomed out and R3 is at a 3 month high also. I would look for a bounce off it if we get back up there. Price would have to hit it and break back and retest it and 123 we go. Best of luck! JTee1

I hate to be a kill joy but here is reality folks. For those who want to trade. Sad but true. For those who fail to plan or fail to follow a plan. Destiny awaits you. Money management is a must. Rules must be established and adhered to. Trade consistently. Demo for a year A trend will last longer then any retrace Some say forex is like gambling, I'm conservative and only bet 1-2% on 4 of a kind 5,15,30,60 min TF harmony EA's = Empty account Your Broker will give you a margin call at 25% to entice you to put more in and try to recover. I don't live to trade! I work a job for a living. I am trying to get a business up and running also. Trading can be enjoyable and profitable with a plan and right setup. I look at news and plan my day the night before to trade after news is over My pc calls me when conditions are right for trading. I wait for retrace set script. Market comes to me i don't chase the market. I enjoy trying to help others, I would be nowhere without the help of others. I have gave credit to the people who have helped me.

If they do have strong, determined momentum, they will break through without looking back. These pairs, that tend to obey the rules, are the more predictable ones. Not all of them are. Here is a ranked list of the top 5, with characteristics of every one of them. The nature of currency pairs tends to shift over time. Some move up the list, while others lose their charm and move down and sometimes out of the list. This is due to many factors, that change. This is an updated list, made towards the beginning of Q3: USD/CHF : The Swiss franc moved to the top. Interventions by the SNB belong to the past, despite the recent strength. The pair tends to break to an all-time low, then range back to the previous low. The ranges are very distinct. A break to the upside will likely meet another previous low. AUD/USD : The Australian dollar still isn’t in its good old days, but the performance is definitely improving. Resistance lines tend to work in a smoother manner than support lines, but they also work well. EUR/GBP : The cross tends to move in ranges, with relatively clear barriers. The narrower ranges made it somewhat harder, but it seems to return to wider ranges. NZD/USD : The recent strength of the kiwi, a currency sometimes overlooked by traders, made its moves much more predictable. This applies to support and resistance lines alike. GBP/USD : While the ranges are wider (and so should stops be), the lines are rather distinctive, especially towards the borders of the long term wide range. This pair closes the list. http://cdn1.forexcrunch.com/wp-conte...1524024_XS.jpg Are you trading any of these pairs? Do you find them predictable or rather unpredictable? As you can see, two major pairs are missing from the list. USD/JPY was never a fun pair. It can move in very frustrating narrow ranges and break lines in very slow and annoying manners. Also the most popular pair, EUR/USD , is missing . The Greek crisis, with the flood of news around it, make trading on this pair quite choppy. This pair had better days, that might return when things calm down.

Unfortunately I came from work too late (16.45 p.m.) I missed all the fun from 16.20 p.m. I know it was risky for me, especially as i not had confirmation of entry..

Hello everyone ! I am looking for a "catch me if you can " Trailing Stop EA To explain better: a "aggressive" TS in "fast" movements. the stop price is not using a fixed amount (5~15 pips TP ), but always at low (or high) of the last candle sets. The rule for the TP price after the open order (sell/buy) are secondary for me. SL is usual: 10 pips . time max. for open orders: 2 ~ 15 min. Some mates of mine from Romania experiences on this. What I found out from them: is based more on price action &amp; THV4. Their rule is: Do not be afraid to lose 3 ~ 5 orders (max2~8 pips SL) until you catch the wave ! (max M1-M5 !!!! ) Of course they are not gamblers . P.S.-as example my previous post (check pdf...) thank you. bfree

38.5 pips on 3 trades. The only trades available per rules all winners. No if's, and's, or's or but's. Notice first trade on why i get out with a 1 to 1 ratio minus spread.

Stefan Trying to catch earlier entries, which is talked about earlier in thread. Earlier discussion was familiar to Divergence flag trading trend. Thanks to Divergence. Missing to many entries if you go by exact rules 8 CCI break of 50 level and 2.4 pip distance to 10 ma. Recently I have been looking in to the turbo cci 30 cci for trend 8 cci entry (again familiar to Divergence entry) Thanks to Daytrader UA Thanks go to Cobra THV folks also. Combining more info on 1 chart http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=127271 Thanks ProAct Traders also. Great mentoring, gr8 charts. http://proacttraders.com/content/winning-trade Thanks Forex Factory Woodies CCI patterns http://www.trading-naked.com/woodie8_patterns.htm I still believe original rules are a very high percentage trade, and gr8 trading. But with all rules intact Market hours, no news, also reasonable rate of return. Otherwise get in and get out, I don't go for long term trades. Will post more info with indicators. I'm using early entry only with 4tf Harmony. Market has the most movement at this time I studied original rules for close to a year. I have full confidence in them. I was posting in flag trading the trends thread when they were 5 min time frame. It was suggested i start my own thread due to Time Frame and entrance difference, so I did. Which I understand. Thinking out loud my Ultimate goal is early entry less lots and add to trade at original entry. 1 to 1.5 or 2 SL TP ratio Hope this answered your questions Happy Trading JTee1

http://forexmagnates.com/us-forex-br...ty-comparison/ Oanda stands out. Is that due to more savvy traders or better trading environment. Their spreads are definately high at news time. I've seen their spreads on E/U over 10 pips at news time. I wouldn't trade with those spreads that could be part of it also. Keeps more traders out of news volatility! You decide JTee1

The template and indicators don't make my chart look anythign like the examples. Could anyone please upload their setup, with the appropriate files placed in the appropriate folders? Thanks!

If you just took the 8:30 news trade that was positive for US and would result in a sell of E/U there went all your stops. Just another example of why I stay out of news. I didn't even set script when I had 4 TF harmony just prior to news release. While this number was less then previous numbers it was better then expected.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi JTee1 I want to clarify something, I should not trade 30 minutes before the news come out. And I should trade 15 minutes later, after the news came out. Is this correct? How to set your stop loss? Do you use the upper donchian level as your SL when you open sell position and vice versa when you open buy? Thanks

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Took second trade only due to news at first trade. Both were winners with either entry. (early or original) TP was calculated the original way low of retrace from donchian then 1 to 1 ratio minus spread. JTee1

I posted early entry off of 8 CCI slingshot back to zero compared to normal entries. Today's results looked better w early entries, less draw down and more momentum going into trade. Getting in earlier then the 8 CCI retracement finder on bottom of chart. Entry 1 pip below close of zero line candle. Requires fast entry and suggest one clicker tool. Something to think about. Happy Trading JTee1

TY for posting your trade. You got it and well played. Happy Trading JTee1

CCI indicator is the impulse indicator which shows impulse in prices. He is ahead of all other indicators at 1-3 bar. For this feature I like it. on the inputs on your screenshot much earlier and with a slow CCI 30 which shows the 30 minute trend inputs to slingshot turbo will be very reliable, when the CCI 30 is coming to the zero line in the range of + -50, given the harmony of the 4 time.

Hey JT, was wondering how you're doing. I've been using your method with success. Thanks for starting the thread.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Toafdawg Glad to hear of your success. Its a good visual trading system some need it and some don't. As for me 7% gain this month on 8 trading days . 7 full winners 1 Break Even and no losses, the break even went on to be a winner, Human error i guess. Should be up 8% but I'm not complaining though. I wish i had the initiative to get up and trade the London session. I've been working to much and not trading enough. Have you been taking early entries or normal entry? I've been taking early entries when possible, sometimes price is on the doorstep of donchian channel or breaks through donchian at 8cci entry signal Keep me informed and your welcome. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I have a tough time getting up for the better times as well. I live in California, so I'm asleep during some prime trades. I've been trying to do watch for early entries, but I'm not entirely familiar with CCI patterns. But I've found that the original rules work. I still try to catch the 3rd wave, and avoid later waves. I do pass by some winners, but its what I'm comfortable with. Keep posting, I love learning from your trades.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I was wondering if you have a simple template to watch on the 5 minute chart? The chart you have posted recently gives me a headache Nice work though! I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
MMM Great thred

--- 帖子 #386 ---
LOL yes 1 min TF can be busy. Not sure what parameters you were looking for exactly. But here is a template for 5 min, it has adjustable TF Donchian channel. Set 0 for current tf or any higher time frame you want. If you want 1 minute TF donchian on 5 min chart just adjust channel value to 4. Hope this helps.

One question, how did your method do for the Euro? Especially during the US session this past Thursday and Friday? It was a wreck on the 5 minute TF. (Chop Suey!!) Do you think you could post a pic showing where you would have gotten in or out? I have only the US session available to trade and most days it is just from 8am est -12pm. Thanks! I find this very helpful.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
4 london trades and 1 us session. All winners per rules. Pop Quiz Do you see the counter trend trades?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Goldenboy Here is Thursday 2 london and no us trades. Both trades were winners per rules. It also kept you out of us session. Which sucked as you already know. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks for the charts. I do some trades that are questionable to me..only looks like it would have worked out for several pips and if you had target of 10-15, it might have otherwise turned against you for small loss. I've posted a chart I have for Friday. Does this look correct to you? TY

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Sorry bout' the double pic. I'm posting another one for Thursday.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Here is Thursday on the 5min TF

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I compared Charts and they look the same. JTee1

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hey JTee1, I appreciate your responses. These all would have been good entries..what are your exits? Touch of pivots or do you have a 10pip and out goal? How would you have know to stay in to ride the longer trades? I myself use a set 10 pip 1st TP and then let the rest run. But my SL is a solid 30 pip SL due to my own money management rules. Just curious, I think the exit is more important than the entry. What say you? -GB

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Exits are by original post 1 to 1 ratio minus spread, I use high or low of retrace as sl and set tp according to 1 to 1 ratio. I will close out 1/2 of position and let ride at times but not typically. I will usually only take 1 trade a day. I'm looking for high percentage trade. I am looking to trade full time in 9 months when I retire. I avoid all news 30 min prior and 10-15 mins post news I look for 1% gain daily and I'm usually done for the day. Just because I have other things i need to do. As far as longer term trades I have rode the 1 min chart for 60 pips before i get a heiken Ashi Candle color change which is usually my exit on the remaining position I have open or the 5 min slow trix color change. But typically i close my position at tp and would rather make another entry at next break of Donchian and avoid retraces as much as possible. I would rather trade 1 lot for 15 pips then .1 lot for 150 pips if you know what i mean. I just feel I got a better chance to win. My pc Alerts me to 4 tf harmony then I wait for a retrace and set a stop order script and let price come to me. My SL on 1 min tf is usually 12 to 20 pips, so tp is usually the same. I use a script to trade by risk percentage and it will set tp to same percentage value. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #396 ---
It seems to me that trades with a SL less than 12 pips mostly end up as losses, so maybe it's better to avoid such trades generally and pick out those with larger SL?

--- 帖子 #397 ---

What time of day was this trade, EST or GMT? JTee1

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi JTee, it was EST. I've been using your system for about four weeks now with success (mainly normal entries), but in my humble perception trades with a stoploss less than 10-12 pips often end up as losses

--- 帖子 #403 ---
What was exact est time my chart looks a little different then yours on the MTF trix just wanted to make sure we were on same page? Not sure off the time offset with your broker. It does repaint some and this may be the difference. A trader Must be confident in whatever system you trade and there will always be losers in any system. JTee1

--- 帖子 #404 ---
What do you feel is the best time frame suited for your style of trading? do you think the 1 minute is better or gives more accurate signals? I have limited time in the morning, usually 8am EST to 12pm EST..to trade with. It seems I would be fine just going for 10 pips a time or should I let the Cavemanager EA with the ATR targets work for me? Hey thanks..getting some good results

--- 帖子 #405 ---
No system can be bulletproof, we all know that but your THV/Flagging compilation gives me proftable trades in the majority of cases The exact est time was "2011.10.04 | 04:02". This was the live screenshot and this is how it looks today on my chart:

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Now after refreshing my chart I see this (no MTF harmony), but while live trading there was MTF harmony.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Marian Yes trade was by exact rules and a loser. MTF Trix only goes back so many bars in history. But this was the trade i thought you were talking about. My next question is did you get in on earlier retrace and break of donchian with 4 tf harmony at red line? I marked your entry in white. I have a 5 min mtf trix up on my chart i posted.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I used the 1 min TF today with my trading. Now, do you trade news at all? No NFP?,,I think I saw you stay out for 30 minutes before and 15 after? Guess I didn't follow that, but the system worked magic today. I walked away with over 113 pips following this! How did you come up with this template? Thanks again, I will post some of my trades in the future, maybe it can help others!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
No, I didn't get in on earlier retrace, because at that time I had no MTF harmony on my chart, H1 fast was still green.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
News time has been when I've had my losers due to spikes. Price usually corrected and went my way but has hit my sl first. Again many thanks to THV Cobra TEAM the MTF Trix is the heart of system, Donchian just sets entry price at low or high before retrace and price must continue in direction of trend. Thanks to PROACT traders and James Harris for mentoring. As far as 1 min TF gives earliest entry and exit signal. Yes please post winners and losers, will help all. As you can see I post very few losers and that is due to being very selective and I have missed some good trades due to news. Congrats to your success. Happy Trading JTee1

Goldenboy 4 TF Harmony then retrace, Then i set my stop order. Then manage trade after break of Donchian. The MTF trix lags as most indicators, price is the real indicator. Higher Highs and lows = more buyers. There was an 86 minute struggle to get to 4 TF Harmony. And yes the the first 60 minutes was a dojo candle on the 1 hour chart classic buyer seller struggle. 15 min chart was up and breaking out of struggle. Hope this Helps, but i only watch one minute chart. It paints a nice portrait of the market for me. Happy Trading JTee1

I appreciate your reply and the time you take to help me/us.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Your welcome

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Marian I try not to trade right into resistance or support. Again trade was by rules, but i would have been counting waves also, by my count you bought in wave 5 at Resistence. I let price break through resistance and wait to see if it will turn into support then a break of donchian. News and S&amp;R have been my losers. I typically take 1 trade a day and go for 1 percent gain and then I'm done. As they say i wait for all the stars to align, I need a good setup no s&amp;r level and if its 7 or 8 pips away that is my target. Then no trades 30 min prior or 10 to 15 minutes after. I miss many a good trade but I have very few losers. My goal is 1% a day. Fear and Greed are our two worst enemies. I don't want bragging rights for 300 pips a day. Just 1% a day and that beats any investment strategy I know of. If i can do that in 10 minutes time that's even better. I know 24 hrs ahead of time the time of day I will be trading and if pc calls me during news time i don't even look at it. 10/12/11 8:40 est to 11:30 full trade then 2:40 pm est the first trade available and only the first at 1/2 my normal trade. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Patience + good setup . I want the Highest percentage trade or no trade. I miss many a good trades when one rule is not in place. 10 hr session on 1 min tf and only 2 to 4 possible trades on average you will need patience. But again I narrow my times the day before and let my pc call me with 4 tf Harmony as my only alert to possible trade.

Here is the trade time i spoke of yesterday. As Charlie Sheen says WINNING. I just had to say it. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thank you, JTee1, for your explanation, this helps very much. As I see now, you do not trade 30 min prior news / 10 to 15 min after news at all. Not only if the FF calender says that news is regarding to EUR or USD but also if news is regarding to other currencies such as CAD. And it is important to respect pivot levels and to learn patience Today I found one entry and it ended up as a winner because I did not move SL to BE. I entered after 30-40 pips down movement after a little retrace. It would be interesting to read what you think about this entry, was it to risky?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Well played sir. Our trades mean nothing to the market at least as far as moving the market. The banks pushed that first 30 to 40 pips move. we are just waiting for it to slow down and hitching a ride when we can. This same trade can be executed without any indicators. I know we are on the 1 minute but zoom your chart as small as possible and look at the wedge the market dropped out of and even broke the low of the day. The chart i marked up is 10 hours in the green box, 600 one min candles. or 40 fifteen min candles. This is the basis for Pro ACT Charts and trading system, jump in on breakout candles and wait for retrace and enter. They use a proprietary charting system based on 10 min charts.

Great, that makes sense Did you take that trade at 04:20 EST yesterday even though there were news at 04:30 EST according to the FF calendar ( UK/Trade Balance )? Today I could not find a good entry between all those r&amp;s levels. Do you take a trade even if there is only a little trix retracement like today at 09:18 EST on cable? I did not dare to enter but it would be a winner:

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hey JTee1, could you check this? Where would a good place have been to put entry? I added a MTF stochastics. Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #425 ---
JTee1, you say you don't trade 30 mins' before or until 15 past news. What news? All or just the major news announcements? Also, how are you using Ultra-stochastic indi on your charts? Thanks..keep it up! GB

Marian I did not take trade yesterday at 4:20, in chart was just illustrating 1 min triggers and how it was coinciding on 15 min chart. Breaking of a high or low of the day. As far as entries in S&amp; R levels yes if i have 7 to 8 pips breathing room i will take trade and watch carefully a color change of Heiken Ashi candle while straddling a S&amp;R level will cause me to set to BE quickly or maybe exit. E/U had a little better retracement at same time period. Lower spread also. Again 9:18 trade was new High of the day and slight stall or retrace after break of R2 and continuation with 15 pips room to next resistance at MR3. Most good runs will be in an overbought or oversold condition, much as the 1 min trix was approaching. This happens frequently in a 4 tf Harmony. Price action is our best indicator when it retraces from donchian channel and breaks through again after making a new high or low of the day with 4 TF Harmony, believe it. Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #427 ---
At the retrace where you placed the Question mark. 4 TF Harmony. new high of day, then retrace, break of donchian, 15 pips to next Resistence . Price I marked on 15 min chart coincides with entry at Question mark .

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Had to hit the forex ATM before work today. Got in 1 bar earlier then early entry after nice move . I had 15 pip to next Resistance at MR1 which had already been broke then retrace for early entry. Very little trading this month due to other commitments, sorry but job and trying to get my own thing up and running is time consuming. Asian market is when i'm home and to slow for me. 3% today Happy Trading JTee1

This mornings trade on 15 min chart any one seeing a pattern of winning trades. I know were on the 1 min chart but what are we basing our decisions off of. A little Sarcasm in this post due to private messages I get regarding 1 min trading and I will lose my ass trading 1 min TF. All decisions to trade are based from Higher TF and good movement then retrace then enter. I've been posting a 15 min chart showing where trades show up there also. To many people want a buy and sell button handed to them and no evaluation and no risk and all winners. Well good luck, losses are part of the game, pick an indicator do the math and probabilities of success to loss ratio and trade it. This thread is setup to not stare at charts all day, let pc call you when conditions are right, then make an evaluation off of your forex knowledge. I do not take every trade nor should you. To many trades outside of rules and times to trade and wonder what happened. 1. Four green lights and go. no 2. 4 tf harmony of higher tf charts. yes 3. Set at pc and watch one minute candles all day. no 4. Predetermined trade times by news calender, and Alert calls you to pc for right conditions. yes 5. Chase market. no 6. Wait for retrace after a decent move when we predetermined it may breakout, and set stop orders for market to come to you. yes 7. Two possible entries early and break of previous high or low for trend to continue . 8. Manage trade. yes 9.Are we confident in our trading system. I am, and if your not you should be or no trading 10. Is this the best and only trading system. No Happy Trading JTee1

Hi JTee1, Thanks for sharing this very interesting method. I've just joined the thread and gave a quick overview along it. Think I've understood the basics but I've a couple of question. As you can see from the first image tonight I was alerted for the harmony, so I prepared my pending order. But, after a few minutes M15 became green again. Had I to pass this trade? In second image (assuming the first answer was NOT)I modified the pending order because donchian went a little up.... Is it right? or I had to mantain the first order? In third image price made new highs, and 15 min &amp; 5 min were still green, so I scratched the trade.... It's right? I'm using Jtee System template, because the standard one freezes my MT4 (Alpari UK live), and loaded AIO indi I found in indies folder. Could you explain me this indi or refer to a post for it? Thanks! Azad

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Short answer is i like to see previous low broke so i would leave sell stop at original location, as long as there is room to next S&amp;R level and the trend was down and seemed to be in a pullback instead of retrace . Most likely 4 tf harmony would pick right back up at your sell stop. Was this in london open or franfurt? Apologies for delay in answering you. I like the first 4 tf harmony after a major news release. Seems to be my best trade. JTee1

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Not my best entry went 11 pips against me then I added .25 lot trade at next CCI Entry. total 21 pips 13 @ .25 lot and 8 at 1 full lot. Happy Trading JTee1

HI JTee1 , i just made +5 pips according to the rule u have set.. have a look at it.... is there anything wrong in it then please tell me..entered at donchian channel 1.3311,tp 1.3318 which is at S1 line and stoploss -7pips.. i forgot to place chart of another 5 successful scalp in US session +2,+10,+12,+9,+8.. its been a good day on demo getting more confidence

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi All I'm trying to get everything set up to follow this system but I have a question about the "alert" file that is in the "expert" folder of the download. Exactly where do you copy this file to in MT4? Is this the alert that sounds when all 4 timeframes come into alignment? Thanks. Mark

--- 帖子 #447 ---
yes it has to copy in expert folder in MT4.. and alert sounds when all lights turn either green or red...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Shariqforex When in profit stay in profit, and it looks like you have. Confidence is the key cut your losers and trade lot sizes your comfortable with and trading can be a breeze. Nice trading day sir! Looks like you played it by the rules for entry, tp and sl is personal preference. What was time EST of this trade? Happy Trading JTee1

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I have been following the thread from the start and for whatever reason, few people have joined in for what I see as one of the few systems that contains all of the ingredients for success. Specific time window, Price Action, MTF, S&amp;R with the channels, etc. I never miss an update on this thread to confirm my thoughts. I am working on a certain level of automation beyond the harmony of the MTF Trix. Once I get to where I want to be, I will post it. Great job. KingHigh

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi Shariqforex Thanks for the help. I get the alerts now. Not sure why the alert says "THV4 trix called AUSUSD,H1:initialized" when all timeframes come into agreement but never the less it works so all is well. Thanks. Hi also to you KingHigh I totally agree with you. This seems like a pretty good strategy to me although I only found it a few days ago. Made three trades tonight, all winners. Only traded half size due to being off hours. I'm using the early entry flavor with a small twist of ensuring you have a strong close HA candle(no wick pointing opposite direction of trade) before entry. I will try to post a chart at some point when I'm a little more comfortable with the strategy. Would be interested in your automation ideas also. Thanks for sharing and many thanks to JTee1 for doing a very good job of explaining his system so very well with all the chart examples and such. I look forward to many more posts on this thread. Thanks to all. Mark

Hi Jtee, Thanks for your reply, the time for that trade was 1:45 am EST which was suppose to be the end of tokyo session.. I live in new delhi so my time u can say (est +10:30 or gmt +5:30).. As far my tp and sl is concerned i m very much comfortable with risk and reward ratio of 1:1 and your system work all the time.. and i am still looking for loosing trade so that i can ask u what went wrong to learn more... i used THV trading earlier but always had a prob with sl and tp because i bail out earlier in winning trade and wait for bounce back in loosing trade. If i get consistency the same way then it will be achievement for me as a newbie.. One thing i want to ask. Do u apply 2.4 pip rule of flag trading in ur system?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I think this alert comes when fast trix cross slower trix.. just check whether the sound file alert on trix cross is false or true.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
shariqforex I've tried to turn off all alerts except for the Trix MTF so I would not have any alarms unless all TF come into harmony like JTee1 suggested. I havn't had enough screen time yet to be for sure but I think that's the way it's working now. By the way...very nice having to wait for a bad trade to figure out what went wrong! Thanks. Mark

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Welcome to shariqforex , markd85 , Aztrader2, KingHigh, sorry not been around much. Work full time and trying to bid work for my startup company. I trade very early in am if and only right after news releases. Ty for those helping others, we all start somewhere. I have done well with this system, its a visual system as most people are visual learners. To many systems are arbitrary and its easy to say I wouldn't have taken that losing trade due to this reason. A loss is part of the game, just keep your trade size to a level where you wont freak out if a trade goes against you. That was my problem in beginning. My first day live trading I took 9 trades all went on to be $ 150.00 winners each without hitting my Stop Loss, but i Bailed early and turned 8 of the 9 into losers. I lost $450.00 my first day instead of making $ 1350.00. my acct was down 9%. By the end of the week i was down 30 % or $1500.00 I regrouped and reduced my lot size and trading became easier. I slowly recouped my money and became more confident. Let my mistake be your lesson. JTee1

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Here my trade +14 pip half an hour before close of asian session i.e around 1:30 est... Entered at 1.3321..sl at red arrow 1.3335 and tp at 1.3307 according to 1:1 ratio... altough price came and touch 1.3308 and bouce but i kept it didnt find any reason to bail out as we always see the sell off at the end of tokyo session... and i was already short.. but didnt like the way it travelled to tp.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Shariq Very nice trades. You probably already know this but if you want to clean up your chart I think you need to put the "font" file in your windows "font" folder. That should make the charts on the right hand side appear and get rid of the squiglly lines! Good trades. Mark

Hi JTee1. I have only just found this thread, and as I tend to concentrate on flag trading I was very interested in your thread. I have spent a long, long time going through the thread by 'Divergence' which is similar. Thank you all for all the very useful information that has been posted. I see that most of you seem to trade using Meta Trader, I am on the Oanda Fx trade platform. I think the indicators used are similar, but could you please confirm that I can trade this method without using Meta trader. Robert.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I could tell you anything, and I would not take any ones word the only way to have confidence in any trading style or system is to Demo it. This is the only way I trade, but this is what I have arrived at after 3 years of searching and demo and live trading. The first two years were demo. Therefore I have faith in my system for me. There is many styles and ways to trade. This is the compilation of many traders work and knowledge. I just put together what worked for me. I'm looking forward to when I can trade full time. It works for me the rules are there. Please read up on the psychology of trading. Going from Demo to live is not easy unless you have a lot of faith in system and good money management practices.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Thanks can you give me a clue if you say something i must trust you atleast so i can demotrade it. But if you say it has not worked so good or one can not live on it it is waist of time. If you will u can pm me. Best regards

JTee1, I am glad to see that this method is still alive. I spent alot of time last year trying to automate the detection of strong possible trades beyond the harmony alert. Got sidetracked somewhere and now I see again that maybe I should get back in the saddle. Your strategy has a really good (right) balance between indicators and price action IMHO. Keep it up. KingHigh

If you like scalping, its not for everyone. Its been good to me.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi JTee. Hope you don't mind me dropping in. I am developing my own THV based scalping methodology to dissimilar to yours. As you say earlier in the thread everyone must develop there own style. A system thaT works for one person may bE completely useless for someone else just because we are all individuals who process information differently and react in different ways to any given set of stimuli. So to take the THV system and make it work one has to work out how you are going to use the THV tools and what else you will use in conjunction with it. The more experienced a trader you are the less reliant you will be on systems and indicators. There is a guy called David Fuller who just looks at raw charts and trades off them. No noise, just pure price action. Your chart set up is interesting. I tend to flick between charts as I like the big picture. The difficulty is juggling between charts and the multiple pairs I like to follow. Are you dedicating one screen per pair? The other area I struggle in in the scalping business is waiting. Boredom gets the better of me and I force trades before proper signals develop. Would be interested if you had similar issues on your journey and what you did to conquer this. Although I scalp profitably overall I am not yet satisfied with my performance. I am resolved not to go live with my interpretation of THV until I consistently trade making 300 pips within strict drawdown limit of 10% and capital increase of 30% all within a four week window. Would be interested to know if you view that as plausible given your experience with your system.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Revoli don't mind at all if you drop in. System works best in London and US sessions with some success in the Asian session. I trade strictly EURUS it usually has good movement in session and the London session seems the most consistent of the 3 trading times. The psychology of trading was my biggest hurdle. Demo to live was tough. First day 9 trades for $150 TP $150 SL, 8 trades were winners and 1 loser by the system outlined in the first page of the forum. By all means I should have $1200-$150=$1050 total gain on a $5000 acct. Long story short I freaked out and lost $450 that day due to me second guessing the system and bailing early. Within two weeks time my acct was down to $3200. I took one week off regrouped and started trading .3 lot vs 1 full lot. $50TP $50SL and within a month I recouped my losses and regained my confidence. Conquering boredom The THV Alerts me to 4 TF harmony. When I hear alert I come to pc and wait for a retrace and a movement back to trend and a set a buy or sell stop at break of the donchian channel. I don't spend all day staring at candles and when I put a trade on I let it ride. This keeps me from getting Bored and trigger happy and trying to second guess or force a trade. I could trade with just THV alert and donchian channel. This is trend trading but getting in when market really moves. You and I and everyone else is always looking to better their trading, but this can be a hinderence to our trading. We will always have are share of losing trades and everyone is looking for the Holy Grail and nobody wants to lose. Someone has to lose for us to win and vice versa. Perfect system its not Right for everybody no Works for me

--- 帖子 #494 ---
JTee Thanks for the reply. All knowledge is useful, its working out what to do with the stuff thats important! Another question, I am trying to get alerts to an iphone from THV signals, inspired by your scripts. I would like to do this using the MT4 notification service that is lightning fast and simple. Have you looked at this at all? The other option is email alerts which I think is probably configurable from your templates but it is very messy and to do this I would need to install an dedicated email server to get through all the security issues and ports that email providers with push mail services require! Means I would not need to be in the office all day . I am reading through your thread, its good stuff, well done. I have lots more reading to do so will save all other queries..... Regards Post script: I have configured the email option for MT4 using a thing called hmailserver, info here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...52#post6502152 I now need to reach into your scripts somehow to get them to send the appropriate email alerts. The only one that appears to have email alert capability is THV Trix v4.01. What I really want is to be able to get alerts MissPips MTF indicator lines up all green or all red. To do that I would need the code, don't suppose you have it?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Update - Sorry, didn't mean to bombard your thread like this, but you might find this useful. Misspips released a later version of her MTF indicator (Swiss Army Toolset etc) as there were bugs in previous versions. Also the new one does have email alert capability! So I now get an email every time the four bars all turn the same colour which brings me into the office where I can then monitor potential trade entries. Superb! Time to get the hammock out and just wait. Oh I attach the updated indicator allcourtesy of the excellent Misspips. Hope that helps people. Just using your template and this alert systems I placed six trades today taking 140 pips and I managed to go and watch son number two play rugby for 2 hours in the key trading times. It would be significantly more but I bottled it a bit early on last three trades. Stunning result. Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #496 ---
The EA Alert v17 has an email true false switch, but I have not used. I believe when set to true it notifies metatrader to email you. I have not used this function but its there in the Alert. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Thanks for your input and congrats on your success today. Whatever system you use it must be used consistently to measure success or failure. I spent 2 years 12 hrs a day staring at charts, setting my alarm clock for London session then US then Asian. Now Its nice to get an email or have your pc call you for optimum conditions and then make a decision when to enter and exit then I walk away. I'm content with 1% to 2% a day in US Session. Your local banker cant come close to that if lucky you get 2% a year. US traders can setup a self directed IRA for tax free trading and watch it grow. JTee1

Variant to initial rules, looking for more scalp trades. Marked entries with SL and TP. Some of the larger trades just missed 1 to 1 minus spread TP. The variant is with 5 slow, 15 fast, 15, slow, 30 fast MTF Trix setting. Other then that most of initial rules are the same. I know this isn't every ones style of trading and that's ok. I'm ADHD and love it. JTee1

Trading Patterns are present in any tf the only difference is the target and sl are larger as the time frame increases. I would rather trade larger lot size for a very brief period. Again not for everyone. Try ProAct charts demo and set in with their mentors for a month free. I sat in the US session for 4 months and it was worth every dollar I spent. I am not affiliated in anyway with ProAct charts, just a satisfied customer. The teach harmony in the market across multiple time frames. No trading in between moving averages, market is undecided and we should be also. Nothing discussed hear is new or exceptional, just different indicators showing what went on in the past and possibly what will happen on a predictable basis. Some days more accurate then others.

Greed and fear are very strong forces in forex trading, that impact all forex traders, even the most seasoned ones. Here is how greed is seen in forex trading, and how you can take advantage of others’ greed. Enlarging Position Sizes After trading for some time, you begin feeling confident. Greed creeps in and you enlarge your positions in order to make more money. Risk? What risk? You neglect the larger risk as you only see the larger profits. This is the fast lane to erasing your account: many traders tend to enlarge their position sizes at a disproportionate manner, at sizes that are much larger than the profit that they gained in their accounts. With money management rules forgotten, liquidating the account can happen within a few bad trades. Holding on to a position for too long You carefully planned your trade and entered a position. And now, the market does precisely what you had expected it to do and moves in your direction. Great! However, you didn’t place a Take Profit order or the pair didn’t just reach it. It’s close, but it didn’t reach it yet. So, do you “let your winner run” and not settle for a partial profit? Greed tells you to do so, and fear tells you to close your trade. A compromise could be moving the Stop Loss order to the break even point, or to some profit. Too many traders tend to do nothing – let the positions float and hope the price will reach their Take Profit or continue moving in their direction forever. This may end in a market reversal and a losing trade. Taking advantage of others’ greed As aforementioned, many winning trades aren’t materialized, and they continue to float. When these open trades are accumulated in a certain direction, these trades will eventually have to closed. When this happens, the market moves in the opposite direction.

Ranging day, good day not to trade at least the US session. There were several decent sells and buys today but I look for a break of previous highs and lows. This system does pretty well in a ranging market also. But that's easy to say when you see the whole day of history in front of you. I see one huge wedge for today, I may take an Asian session breakout of the wedge but .1 lots only. I like to gamble but only when I can see there face across the table from me. 4 of a kind 5,15,30,60 min Harmony!! Sure bet! JTee1

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks! I just like going with the immediate trend and price coming to my stop order and the market opening my trade and market determining the outcome. I've second guessed myself out of to much money in the past. Most people cant handle a loss and they freak out. I'm up 18% this month with very little trading. Imminent news and Support or resistance that has been hit and proved itself recently is the only reason I wouldn't take a trade in the London or US session.

4 trade entry's on a ranging day. Perfect example of we are never guaranteed a trend continuation. All 4 were winners by the rules on a very ranging day. They were not large trades but they weren't losers either. Greed can be our worst enemy in trading. JTee1

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Why do you take away spread from your target ? for example you have a stop of 10 and a target of 8 ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #573 ---
The pulse or waves in the market are cyclical in nature. While nothing is guaranteed the retracements and pulse forward are typically a 1 to 2 ratio ( say 10 pips retrace then 20 pips forward this has to happen for a trend) and since my stop order is placed at a 1 to 1 ratio ( retrace say 10 pips then 10 pips forward I have 10 pips remaining to target. More then anything its my style of trading in and out with quick profit because nothing is guaranteed. I consider the spread as a cost of doing business. Just look at last Friday we will never be able to predict the absolute perfect entry or exit. But we took our profit out in the middle of a move. It is very easy to see missed profit when all the candles for the day are in front of you and you look back at the end of the day. Looking back at all my trades there was plenty more to be gained by staying in and could still be profitable on a 1 to 2 ratio. It could be used for the breakout trade entry of all the sessions with a move to break even at the 1 to 1 win ratio and a trailing stop of the initial gain ( but trailing stops have taken most of my profit before). More then anything I wanted a concrete system that had rules that were definite and definable for me to do a statistical analysis on. Many traders will or do say I wouldn't have stayed in due to this or that and is to arbitrary. Why I have not taken trades due to my gut feeling and I was usually sorry because it went on to be a winner. When the price breaks the previous high or low its telling us where the market is headed, we just have to manage the trade. My goal is not to have the largest trade but a steady profit progression. Fridays have been the days I lose trades on, and I usually stay away from US session. I hope this helps

Tough morning had 4 trades 2 I set to BE plus a couple bucks but they retraced after good profit the other 2 broke out and I closed early time to go to work.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Nice trade David.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Do you have a specific technical criteria for setting BE ? HA color change maybe ?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I wanted to ask the same.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
All trades today were early entries with 4 trix tf harmony(5 fast, 15 fast,15 slow, 30 fast)established. All went $ 50 to $70 in profit then BE set or best BE I can set with SL script I drag on screen for fast SL set. I don't like posting my trades that are not per exact rules. I don't want to confuse traders that may be new to trading. If you make 1 trade a day for 20 days and you are consistent with Lot size and TP and SL and win 11 and lose 9 trades it would be considered a profitable system. I made 24 % last month and I am up 20% this month. Yes original rules state several exit strategies, color change of HA candles or color change of 5 slow trix at close of candle only for longer trades. I added the smoothed Heiken Ashi candles for possible longer trends. My best advice is when in profit stay in profit, my goal is not the biggest trade but consistent growth. I would rather make 4 dollars and close trade and re-enter market again then go negative. My buy and sell stop script is set at 15 sl and 15 TP for 1 lot, I adjust SL immediately when I set script to retrace level then adjust TP to same distance minus spread. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
$52 or 1.04% Asian trade

If its not a problem, I will post my trades, according to this strategy. I hope I can lear from it.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
$121.00 or 2.42 % I marked SL in red as trade progressed once price retraced and moved up I drag SL script into place and locked profit. While I know it could hit and close trade at least it will be a winner.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
JTee1, where can I find the SL and TP drag and drop script?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Thanks a lot Jteee. I have another question Do you consider the FPV line to be a trend filter at all ? ie if price above FPV, only take longs, if below, only shorts ? And basically, would you avoid this EJ setup (see scrshot) ? FPV to close too price imo ?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Here you go! Good luck!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Niepce on the FPV I don't use it as a trend filter for sell or buy I use the price bouncing off it or any other Support or resistance line then I respect it. What I like about the 4 tf harmony is price movement and it usually moves when there is harmony. I couldn't help but notice you are using the older template of 5Slow,15Fast,30Fast and 60Fast trix. I have been using the 5 slow 15 fast and slow and 30 fast trix. I get more trades and usually in a little earlier on the good moves. But the old template has been real good to me also. Can you send me another screen shot with mtf trick, and time of trade so I can evaluate prior highs and lows because mtf trix and prior price action is the heart of the system. Best of luck!

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Found the EJ Trade time in question. All 3 trades had New lower highs and lower lows at entries which signify downtrend continuing. We had a 5 slow trix retracement then a continuation. These are some of the best trades.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Cheers thanks JTee1

Hello,I'm glad that traders like you give your system free for testing and download. Test thy system a few months and is really profitable and it works. However, if the rules. :-) Test it on E / U, A / U, G / U So it took me a while before I fully understood it and focused in different versions. Suppose combined with each different version is probably not perfect, that the different versions are configured so that together corresponded. Do not ask, some things do not add me to the chart and in the choice I have is gray, I intended that India and temp. They also somewhere else? And finally .... Any new insights? :-D Thanks a lot, I had long sought system (I can not program .. yet ..), which is intended to scalping is a clear, simple, and no indicator million.

I do not like noise in the 1 minute chart. That's why I removed the standard time frame, and moved to the outside of the time charts. I want to show range bar chart, which is all the bars are 5 points from minimum to maximum. In my view such a mapping chart has made an analysis of the market cleaner and not as tough as the chart Renko. I do not want agitate to come to my church, just look to trade with the other side. http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/235...angeeurusd.gif

Daytrader I've had no success in getting range bars for metatrader 4 to work. Would welcome any help in this matter. I've been rather lazy in trading, I didn't trade for a good year due to work situation. I will be retiring full time soon and am looking forward to trading full time. I missed Fridays trade my speakers were off and didn't here alert while getting ready for work. I appreciate you not wanting to agitate, but I welcome your opinion, scalping fits my personality type. I do believe range bars give a more honest view of market and timed candles can distort market view. But with that said I've adapted pretty well at reading market to an 80% win rate while keeping with sound money management . If traders can overcome their fears and emotions it can be enjoyable and profitable. Thank you Sir Your opinion always welcome here!

Why Breakouts? Regardless of Time frame a previous high or low or consolidation is the same on a 1 min through a 1 hour time frame most of the time. When price breaks it, every trader regardless off their perspective time frame see it and the majority jump on the band wagon. This creates more volume and price moves, and then more traders jumping in. This is why banks create the head fakes that we jump on and try to ride, then they close and reverse and take your money. This is why I usually get in and out before they start thinning the herd. At the end of the day I usually walk away with some change and very few losses. But I take very few trades on a one minute chart throughout the day. I need the perfect storm! Flip a coin for buy and sell and if you take the same trade you will be close to break even at the end of the year, statistically speaking. (Disclaimer Don't try it) Find the right times to trade and some technical analysis and your odds increase. Get over the fear and don't get greedy with some sound money management is another plus. I'm the first to admit I leave a lot on the table on my exits, but I have a pretty good entry. I've tried longer term trading and have had some $600 winners but some $300 losers also. Most of us know this but do we practice it? Rant or Rave you decide.

I am not sure to understand the new template correctly. you are using the CCI 100/-100 thresholds for early entries ? In some of your recent screenshots, i don't see the 4 trix aligned, no more respect of the donchian?

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Three templates 3 TF 5,15,30 TF with retrace and break of 1 min 20 donchian channel 4 TF 5,15,30,60 TF with retrace and break of 1 min 20 donchian channel Early Entry with either temp above using CCI retrace and enter on 8 CCI break of 0 and I like to see wattah explosion same color as 170 CCI or reducing from retrace. I trade breakout trades both ways with sell and buy stops at openings and consolidation periods ,regardless of indicators. Like earlier today after lunch. I still like the original template and break of donchian the best. Sorry for confusion cci

I bet the DT is over. Note, it's not a forecast, don't claim to read the stars. Just a bet. Using your CCITHV template, I really prefer these early CCI entries, over the Donchian break. This "Waddah Attar" is quite good. Im watching my "wealth" increase tick by tick ^^ However, I am not sure the PVA indicator is useful, for me, so far...

--- 帖子 #735 ---
I agree, conditions suck today, at least on the low spread pairs.. I like your system, thanks for your work. I don't think I'm very good at it yet, but practicing. See if you like this indicator. I do. It shows different aspects of trend activity kind of ingeniously..It seems to compliment the Waddah Atar pretty well also..

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Unsustainable move need major correction then trade. Afternoon is approaching I am out of this mess. Just my take on it

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Steve it looks interesting, look for patterns, at openings of market. I love buy and sell stops and letting the market come to me. Stay with 15 min trend at minimum and the break of previous highs and lows. Watch CCI and don't get in a trade at overbought or oversold areas. I also like to have a break of 5 min donchian and break of 1 min donchian simultaneously. I know I am in the trend then. Anticipate the move to overbought and oversold areas. That's were the money is and the stop orders come in handy.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Ok JTee thanks for the advice. I'll keep working at it.. I'm not completely used to watching for indications across so many indicators, counting 1,2,3's, looking at multi TF's all at the same time and so forth.. Thus the practice to try and get it all together without getting turned around.. Much easier at least when the market is actually moving me thinks...Green pips to you..

hello traders,, can any post with good screen shots for explaining with trade enter and exit method.. still i can;t found better method for enter and exit ,...but hope this template working best ,,,, JTee1 pls give good explaining for us using screen shots ... as well as tell me pls wat is best template among this ?? thanks u very much ...

--- 帖子 #765 ---
hello JTee1 hope u will reply me when u see this posts .... can u tell me pls ,, where is the place should i put font folder? hope u will reply Soon... thanks u very much sharing this great template..

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Font goes in windows font

--- 帖子 #767 ---
us fantasy Post 1 is all the explanation for all templates. 4 tf harmony then retrace and then break of Donchian channel is the safest entry. There are some early entry templates to use also. I suggest the original template 1 min thv flag trading. At 3-5 pips profit I move to break even. If stopped out at Break EvenI look for re-entry. Define trend on 15 min tf at minimum for safest trading. My latest trading has been with the renko candles and is price only without a timeframe. So charts may look a little different. It filters out a lot of the noise. I stick by the original thread though. Always looking to better my trading. Sorry for delay.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
JTee1 thank you for ur reply...... i will read and practice again and again... hope template working best,,,,,, are u recommend this template for gold trading ?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Have not traded gold.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
ok JTee1 thanks..... can we use this template +Ea for auto trading system....? currently i received sound and notice command only from Ea ... but i saw ur first post image showing trade ""opened by scripted """.. so can u tell me pls is this template+ea can use for auto trading????

--- 帖子 #771 ---
No ea function, but I use a buy or sell stop script that I set when price retraces away from donchian channel. I then set a preset script with sl and tp at the high or low of donchian channel. Then I let price action come to me.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
wow.. great mate.... can u like to share it here??.... last few years i waste more money with forex, so last year start to learn this ,, reading blogs and etc, so could u pls share it ???

--- 帖子 #774 ---
JTee1 thank u very much mate... ...

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Trade on 1 min but keep an eye on weekly picture with 15 min chart at all times. Previous trend clearly seen and heavy resistance. Need a 1,2,3 pattern above resistance to go long again. I'm I sell mode for now, market will have to prove to me otherwise.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Tuesday what I will be looking for. Just a breakout of a Monday lower volume day, and in conjunction with 430 or 830 news release. Will it happen who knows, just use wise money management. Will probably straddle trade news release with oco scalp trade and tight stops.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
dear JTee1 are u doing manually trading or ea trading ? i mean u shared ea /..... as well as can tell me which time frame is the best working time frame for the template... because i earn some time very good .... and very fast ... but some time i got caught to the template... but i know template is very good for trading ... pls give answer? as well as tel me which pair working perfectly with this mtf indicator? thanks

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Manual trading with mostly stop or limit orders. I just keep eye on resistance and support on 15 min tf and look at market over 7-10 days for trends and major S&amp;R levels. Keep an eye on CCI overbought and oversold conditions with S&amp;R levels for reversals.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
ok thanks.......im still find some good pair......

--- 帖子 #780 ---
hi JTee1 i got very good signals mean while trading... it is awesome... as we as i love sound alert ...bcoz i used many sound alert before,but all are give fake signals to me... this signal can trust more than 90% .... so we can enter the trade with confidence ...as well as mtf 5.15.60 it is awesome .... when news release time we can use this .....still im find many things hidden in the template... after all explore i plan to share it under this thread, then newbie can success soon ....i like to thanks once again JTee1..... i need to use this gold .... so i invite u test with gold

Hi Jtee1 I came across your thread a week or so with great interest and have been monitoring and trading your system with small lots The market is very slow and for me it seems to be giving a few false signals. Could I ask, is it your opinion that you should wait for the mtf to eastablish a few ( all greens for L and a few all reds for S ) yesterday (Tuesday) there was some movement on a few pairs which resulted for me as all positive results but today it was slow and for me gave a few bad trades. One last think, could you clarify which mtf indi is the best to use for 1mtf . I know they are posted on the first page but there seems to be a few posted through the thread and also could you clarify the chi settings again what you use for the 1mtf I thank you in advance and please keep your thread going as your system shows great potential Reagards

--- 帖子 #794 ---

U/J was good to me today. $352.00 3 trades. See chart

--- 帖子 #796 ---
First of all welcome. Secondly every system will have losing trades. While I do take other trades outside of the system and some are posted here. I hope you have read the first post as all rules are there for the early entry system and traditional entry at the break of the donchian channel after 4 tf harmony. I do look for breakouts at market opens and news time, these are some of the best trading moves for scalp trading. While I usually go for 15 pips I do cut some trades short when price stalls. I have probably cut to many winners short. But nothing is guaranteed in forex. Indicators are just showing us past market behavior. The cci settings are fast 8 slow 34. Good luck and best regards.

--- 帖子 #797 ---

--- 帖子 #806 ---
From post 797 to here were scalp trades with simple trend line bounce or break and and cci validation along with Waddah Attar explosion indicator and close order script dropped on chart when I get 20 or 30 dollars. post 797 was Asian open and I held on to it expecting a little bit of a breakout. post 798 fit a classic trade of thread but I bailed early. Four buys would have went the 150.00 if I let them run. But since they overlapped each other I probably wouldn't have taken them all. The sells were retracement trades. The 5th buy may or may not make the 150 and it was a classic thread trade. Its all fun and games until someone has a margin call.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
I look for trades at opening of markets and after news releases. Many times the 4 tf harmony and retrace and break of donchian signal can be at the very end of trend during low volatility trading times. I trade this system from 3-6:30 am est 8:30 - 11:30 am est and 8-10 pm est. Preferably the London open with us open 2nd choice then lastly Asian session. The other periods you don't have the extreme moves and many times it is at the end of a move. With that said if you time all your entries with the Waddah Attar explosion indicator, I believe you will always find yourself in profit soon and then my friend its just trade management from there. This indicator will give you an entry and exit popup. I use it for entry signal only and exit when in profit or move sl to be. No loss is a great thing. I get stopped out on some good moves but it also lets you trade for free. Hope this helps

Took this trade before work. Three time frame harmony for $84.00 and above trades on galaxy note phone. 4% total for day JTee1

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Here are the 4 trades for Friday. I threw on the tdi and 15 min trix indicators. While I traded price action mainly with macd confirmation, notice the similarities of the trades. 1. TDI slow was trend sloping with trade, then fast TDI retrace and break of slow TDI. 2. 15 min fast trix signified a change of trend. 3. MACD the only indicator I had up at trade times showed lower lows and highs with a confirmation of movement back to trend. 4. Most important was price action prior lower lows and lower highs for sells. Combined with power bar or dojo candles. This is coming from an ex indicator junkie. Again all educated guesses that without sound money management would turn into losers at some time. I still stand by the original thread and its profitability when traded during the volatile trading periods only. JTee1

Well played my friend. While this system has been very good to me, some people have issues with it. I'm glad your getting the hang of it. It will definitely get you in on the big moves of the day. Will there be losses, of course. I eliminate most losses with BE after 5 pips, but this will eliminate some winners also, but I look at re-entries if BE takes me out.

Thanks J Tee for the ideas I find they are great ...the only problem is trailing the trade and the stop hunting....the good thing a bout the 1 min chart, is that you can see in front of your eyes how the robot hunts the stops....wash and rinse every 5 minutes...every second fractal get´s spiked and away we go.... It´s actually amazing how the big boys perfected their game....ready to wipe every single edge....100 billon US traded day in day out, and the Federal rteserve owns the shop...no wonder they have power...this is the biggest rigged casino on earth.... What I want to do is try to learn to pick those spikes, "somehow"....and follow their bloody trail....I think the secret of success in this game lies hidden in the big boys cheating systems....

That's why I'm in and out short term trades set break even quick and tp quicker and maybe let some ride if its with a 2 or more day trend. Nothings guaranteed and if we think it is were only fooling ourselves. Take yesterdays unemployment release spike down opposite of what news release findings were. At 8:28 I got news release early. I bought E/U after spike down and returning up. Just to get better price. To many times this happens but knowing this happens we can use to our advantage. I like to trade 11:45 to 12:45 est against trend at second sign of reversal the big boys closing out trades before lunch and price retracing.

My current project renko bars. Definitely less noise and a predictive nature to set stop orders due to 5 pip bars

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Then, what should I do?

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Can you share this?

--- 帖子 #865 ---
The fonts in the unzipped folders you downloaded should go into here.

Quick snapshot of settings and rules. Buy above cloud sell below cloud. Waddah attar explosion above trend line average. Stop orders can be placed in a predictive manner of 5 pip increments when approaching cloud for trend continuation and bounce off of cloud.

US open Breakout trades conforming to 3 TF or 4 TF harmony per system. Some are reversal trades from London, some are continuation trades. All are breakout trades from London consolidation to US open.

Typically don't trade after 12 but the 2 pm news release pulled me in.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Check this out guys! 1 M Eurusd it´s so interesting to read the Big boys hands , easy after the fact though! Their trading takes care of all the macd, EW, Fiboetc... crowd out there, dilligently reading their books and making calculations on their 5000 U$ softwares. To me these Big Boys are the best traders, and they are the best people to learn from....they try to be stealth, it takes them a lot of effort to move the prices to where they know all the stops are waiting though...sitting ducks... My 2 cents.. Good trading...

So your "cloud" is Dragon SonicR? I am interesed by "the cloud". Can you post this indy and his settings? In the present I use Ichimoku and Coral as a filters.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
I was looking for a trading system that can put me on the profit track after blowing my account 4 times. I am fed up now with refilling my account. My problem is that I close the trade very early when its in profit but I keep it running if its in loss wishing and waiting that it will come to break even. But this never happens. Due to my job and time constraints, its not possible for me to attend the PC when the conditions are optimum for 1 Minute THV falg trading. What help I need for you guys is that, can an EA of this system will be able to help me? Please help me.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
- The man who invented it and the original thread from which I borrowed it Here's separate Dragon :-) black and white Yes, yes, Ichimoku is good too

--- 帖子 #897 ---
As for me, its very difficult to sumarize all the filters to open a possition. It seems that the strategy could work without stohastic.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
asian and london trades.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Hello, you need to look for such a system that suits you at work. Try SonicR need to TF60 - 240 .. This is not EA, but pretty handmade :-) (if I stupidly translated so sorry :-))

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Hey, it's just not, Stoch is the main indicator, of course, would be to replace it with another, or to follow only Dode, but Stoch determines the light inputs. Then this person must have nakoukané, like everywhere :-)

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Adjusted preference, to make it more clear, for any input ..... Main remains Stoch, added RSI (filt as possible, but it is in testing phase) in the background even additional (much gray) base remains the same shop at the trend by Stoch (check suppliers and RSI)

--- 帖子 #902 ---
John what size renko bars are you using?

--- 帖子 #903 ---
3 good entries on original system

Jtee1 I hope that in the near future I will also trade fulltime, one account I have vymyzal, but only fault of their own, and now I'm putting together money and thinking about going abroad, but not accumulating capital, I was not stressed. Otherwise, thanks :-) You're going too well

JTee1: I have a question about Red candle color trade change close in the original 1 min THV Flag trading. Do we close the trade on the HA(Heiken Ashi) candle color change or on the PA(Price Action) candle color change? Looking forward for your reply.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
jtee: i will prefer to see trades taken from proper charts not from mobile.. please take care of that..

--- 帖子 #652 ---
hi! JTee1, I look forward to you to come back full-time trader's identity, continue to share your great experience and knowledge! Greetings from China.(I'm sorry my English from google.)

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi! I am using this strategy right now and i have a doubt. My doubt is: Do you put a order of sell at the same level that a low of the day? In the picture you can see the situation.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi JTee1, Your trading system is looking like charts on proacttraders.com. Are you also using fractals to define the spaces big enough for trading?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
zig zag pointer but very similar to fractals. Most trades of mine lately are news trades and scalps. Just feel more comfortable with news and market movement where the big boys will move market ahead of news in opposite direction to get a better price. Figure direction out and wait for a good retrace for better price also

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Ty ;-)

--- 帖子 #657 ---
hi friends, i want to ask anyone still useing this system ????

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Same question, is anyobody still using this system and which template and indis are the one in use right now?
