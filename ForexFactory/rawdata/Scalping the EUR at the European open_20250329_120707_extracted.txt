Here is a trading system that can produce 100 pips at the European open (7 - 8 am GMT) by trading a basket of four EUR pairs. Observation of price action reveals that when the EUR/USD pair moves, to too do other currencies that are in synergy with the EUR/USD pair. Why trade the EUR/USD only when a 25 pip scalp on four synchronized pairs will meet the target of 100 pips. The set up rules are simple, and if followed will produce the desired result. Note: This strategy works best when EUR/USD and EUR/JPY are trending up or down. The strategy is no good when the Euro is channeling sideways. There are three essential criteria that need to be synchronized for the best possible outcome. They are: EUR is strong against all other currencies for long trades. (Weakest for short trades). All chosen EUR pairs are trending in the same direction. The 7 am candle for each selected pair on a 15 M time frame are all pointing in the same direction (up for longs and down for shorts). Here are the strategic steps to follow: At 6:30 am (GMT) check the currency strengths using a simple H/L leader list as shown in the example chart below (EUR pairs are coloured blue). If the EUR/USD is in the upper quadrant of the list and is seen to be rising since midnight (GMT) the indication is to go long. If the pair is in the lower quadrant then the indication is to go short. Best results are when the EUR pairs are grouped together at the top (for long trades) or at the bottom (for short trades). Important note 1 : If price has reached a new high or a significant resistance level there is a very high probability that price will retrace. Watch the 7 am candle for the signal to go short. Check the major trend using 100 MA on a 15 Minute chart. Use a 20 MA, 50 MA and 100 MA moving averages and daily pivots. Make sure that the four pairs you have chosen are moving in synchronicity ( they all have the same shape and trend) . If the trend is up go long and if the trend is down go short. Best results are when price is above the daily pivot, 100 MA and 50 MA for long trades and below these indicators for shorts. Important note 2 : If you can't identify a strong trend or price is channeling sideways - stay out. Wait for the 07:00 - 07:15 am candle. If the candle points in the same direction as the trend on all four pairs then trade in that direction. Important note 3 : If there is no agreement in all four pairs of the direction of the 7 am candle - stay out. Do not trade. There will normally be a bullish bar at about 7 am for long trades or a bearish bar for shorts. This is your primary indicator. You can catch it with a stop order. If you miss it, wait for the pullback. I have learned to call this 7 am bar the ' truth ' bar. Whatever else may be happening with any other indicator, this 7 am bar will point in the direction of the coming move, but only if there is agreement with all your selected pairs . The simple strategy is to follow the direction it points to get into your position. Which pair you choose to trade is up to you. When there is good synchronicity I personally trade all four selected pairs. After the 7 am bar, there is often a pullback or a pause until about 7:30 ( sometimes as late as 07:45 ) when the move will resume right through to a spike at 08:00 am. You can be cautious by placing a buy stop order above the last bar of the pullback on a 15 M chart, or a sell stop order below the rising pullback for shorts. If you are using a 5 M time frame, the pullbacks can be a bit scary, but consider the action of throwing a ball. You bring your arm back before you throw, and this is a similar action. The stop orders will remove any risk if the pullback turns out to be a reversal, which is unlikely if you do follow the direction of the 7 am 'truth' bar. I use a 25 pip target with a 20 pip stop for a scalp trade. Never hold onto a position when there is a pending high impact news release or you will get stopped out by a whipsaw. Perfect set-ups for this strategy don't appear every day, but as time progresses I shall post examples of good trades where the set-up criteria have been met, together with examples of when to stay out. Any questions you may have should be answered simply by looking at the charts posted. Polite notice: Please check past charts for answers to your questions rather than clutter the thread with continuous questions. Thank you for taking an interest and I hope and trust that this thread will be useful to you all. ( It will only if you follow the strategic rules ). If it works for you please give your vote in the poll and pass it on to others. Successful trading to all. The chart for 18th shows 4 pairs with the currency strength list, but the strong GBP meant that momentum was lacking, but the second chart for the 17th shows good momentum and a closer look at the 7 am 'truth' bar.

For those of you viewing this morning the EUR is set to continue its rally. I have already opened long trades on the EUR/USD, EUR/NZD, EUR/AUD and EUR/JPY. 20 pip stop and 100 pip target.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you for sharing this strategy. I attempted it this morning with EURAUD +26 pips I didn't trade EURCAD but was watching and it was a nice little scalp as well! Will attempt tomorrow with a EUR basket.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Nice one. Thanks for taking the chance. I'll post copies of today's charts in a mo.

Interesting. thanks for sharing.

Good morning. Here are the charts for this morning to show entry points and the 8 am spike. USD was a bit strong this morning and EUR/USD didn't perform well, but all others did. This demonstrates the value of trading a basket, and shows how the strategy works. Profit taken - day's work done. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Interesting ideas here. What would be a suggestion for checking the currency strengths as a leader board? Is it possible in MT4?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks for sharing this strategy Terence, i like to learn from you thanks alot!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I don't use MT4, but I would guess that any trading platform worth it would have some facility for showing pairs on a strength scale, perhaps by the % move for the trading day.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks tellboy. MT4 doesn't seem possible but I do have it on my IG platform so shouldn't be an issue for me.

Here is the EUR/USD chart for this morning, Thursday 20th April 2017. It shows clearly how the strategy works. The pull back can be a bit scary on the 5 m time frame, so to alleviate anxiety it is wise to place a buy stop order above the last bar. This will catch the up move, but if price carries on down you will lose nothing. This first chart shows the scalp strategy at work on the EUR/USD. The second chart shows how price moved after the scalp on all four pairs. Notice how I was stopped out on a down spike on the EUR/AUD. That is because I didn't use a buy stop for my entry. That's a good lesson for all of us. The second chart also shows the value of taking the first scalp and then staying in the market for a longer trade.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks for sharing mate, Have you tested this at the new york open on usd pairs?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanks tellboy to show us this system. Does anybody know an mt4 indicator to sort the currencies by "%Chg"?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
investing.com has a good live list that you can sort by % changed

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks Hazza88, is a good list but there are far to many pairs. Perhaps a small mq4-dashboard would be cool.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Yeah there are, please let me know if you find one, thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
http://www.actionforex.com/markets/top-movers on this site there is a top10 movers of the day. It can help but a dashboard would be the best for sure.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
how do you handle news at the opening?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Stay out when there is a pending news release. You will get stopped out.

Interesting! Subscribed. Thanks TellBoy

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Interesting system. Hope make good pips with this one

--- 帖子 #27 ---
This might be a solution at the moment. Thanks to the creater.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
an great example of the euro session trade, waiting for a pullback and get into the trade, as mister Terence says, place a buy stop above the pullback candle. as this system is so easy and simple you can easily master this and only spend 2 hours max on the chart. which means alot of spare time. Thanks for sharing Mister Terence. Looking forward to use this alot more and share this withl the community. ~Robin van Delft

gdwales: Post 5 lists his 20Pip stop loss and 100 Pip target.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
5:1 RR is really good but a 100pip target is very big for this kind of strategy. The price reverses a lot of the time

--- 帖子 #33 ---
When a currency is rallying as fast as this I find it useful to open two positions (with buy stops above a pullback). One position has a 20 pip target and the other a much larger one at perhaps 50 or 100, depending on the pair. In my experience the EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD and EUR/JPY can often accommodate at 100 pips target, as I made today on EUR/JPY. It all depends on the strength of market sentiment with momentum. Today's charts are an excellent example. These rallies are not every day, and when they do come along we need to know how to trade them. I think (guess) that we could see a continuation tomorrow to round the week off. If you are cautious use paper trading. Happy trading to all.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I am happy to keep my trading to an early session only, as I have other things to do, but try it if you like and see if it works.

I will be looking at this system myself tomorrow morning, As I trade the London open Always like to contribute so here is an indicator, Attached File(s) Currency Meter .ex4 55 KB | 603 downloads

--- 帖子 #37 ---
It makes no difference what time frame you are using. I am in London time zone, so 6:30 is the same in all charts. I use the 30 M time frame to identify the major trend, then go to 15 M for timing the pull back for entry. You could use 10 or 5 M if that is your preference. The most important factor in choosing your pairs to trade is that they must all be in sync , that is all rising (for long trades) or all falling (for short trades). Don't choose a pair that is out of sync. You could start by going to the 30 M time frame and look at the top four pairs if they are all clumped together for one currency (i.e. EUR). Or you may choose to go with a group of GPB pairs if GBP is the top currency for the day. This will all become clear as we progress. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
What actual time is the London open? Is it 9 am?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
As far as I know it's 8 o'clock opening Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I thought so. That explains the 8 am spike. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
No EUR trades today. None of the strategic criteria have been met and there is no synchronicity for EUR pairs.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes , is right . I will try to put some buy on USD , to test that .

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I've been trading fx for about 6 yrs &amp; have found the london open is generally the most consistent profit taking system ive used. If your there at the right time early as tellboy explained) &amp; then your out safely at non stretched levels ! The thing with the new york open is its mingled with the london market open &amp; is mostly active during the london market activity which does make it a very dodgy time to trade especially at the open. And the new york open usually reverses the original london open trend sentiment as banks etc have to trigger others stop orders so they can trade against them &amp; soak up others money for there moves to happen. Watch out for the 8.00am european news releases when trading the london open because they can instantly reverse a seemingly stable, strong move that you could be trading with ! If you can trade with those news releases then thats another feather in your cap ! But obviously much safer to stay out then. Another smoother time to trade is during news free asian session. Heres a link to a very reactive currency strength meter thats better to use with a %change currency list. http://www.currencynewstrading.com/3...ter-explained/

Today none of the two essential criteria for the successful execution of this scalping strategy for the London open (8 am UK time) were met. Here are the EUR charts for today to illustrate the example. The 50 MAs are crossing the 100 and this suggests a pause at support for a return to rally next week or a possible reversal. Notice the absence of clear directional signals at 6 and 7 am and the conflicting directions of the MAs as price moved sideways in indecision. Checking these charts at 10 am shows a move down from the pivots, which is ok for the day trader, but not for the 8 am scalper. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

which platform are you using

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I am using pro real time through the broker IG Index .

--- 帖子 #47 ---
do you set your trades at breakeven at an specific level?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I set two targets, one at 50 pips and one at 100. When momentum stalls before the first 50 pip target I exit and let the other run on. If it looks like reversing I'll exit before it returns to break even. It all depends on momentum.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
If you follow the strategy strictly it will be profitable. Don't try to 'make' it work. If you follow the instructions it will work by itself. The stops and limits you set are up to you, and that comes from experience. The strength of the move will determine the profit. I won't wish you 'good luck' because chance has nothing to do with it. I'll wish you 'good trading'.

Conflicting signals for the EUR this morning. Price gapped up over the weekend and began to retrace to fill the gap until 3 am when it showed its hammer bar. At 6:30 the currency strength list showed the EUR at the bottom, which is an indicator to go short. Therefore there was conflict with the trend indicators on the 30 M chart. This conflict says 'stay out'. The first chart shows four pairs on the 30 M time frame showing the gap-up and the EUR at the bottom of the list. The second chart on a 15 M time frame shows the result of the conflict with the absence of a spike at 8 am. Price continues sideways pending the German news release at 9 am. Another reason to stay out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good morning, I'm starting to testing the Strategy. I also live in Europe, so the Strategy fits very well to my Trading Plan. For what do you use the pivot points? greetings

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I don't calculate the pivot points myself, but leave that to my software to do it automatically.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Here are two charts to illustrate price action on the EUR pairs this morning. The upper chart shows the major trend on the 30 M time frame with clear indicators for a continuing trend to the upside. NZD pairs came bottom of the list (in yellow ) with GBP (green) at the top. Although I recommend staying out of trading if the EUR pairs (coloured blue) are not grouped together at the top of the leader board, it is useful to bear in mind that when GBP moves so does EUR. So I was confident enough to apply the entry strategy and the result is shown in the lower 15 M chart where you can see that I made a profit of 131.

I applied the strategy to Gbp pairs , and the result is very nice . Thx !

I have made 50 Pips only. But nevertheless a nice day

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Are you saying you set buy trades for the four EU pairs. I can understand you setting a buy trade for EUR/NZD &amp; EUR/CAD they are in the top five. But I don't understand why you had EUR/USD &amp; EUR/AUD Am I missing something. PS. It seems to be a great system, And I'm not criticising you, I just like to have things clear in my mind. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
When a major currency moves, it moves against all other currencies, albeit it with variable momentum. The choice of pairs to trade is largely dependant on personal experience of which ones yield the best profits. In my own personal experience the USD, CAD and JPY tend to move in synchronicity with each other. Of these three the JPY tends to produce the highest yield in pips. CAD has a tendency to have a wide spread and can move sharply in a pullback. I have lost a lot of pips with CAD in long trades. EUR, CHF and GBP are synchronised and rarely drop out of sync, so there is no point in pairing them for trading. That's another reason why the system works as well with GBP if that is your major currency of choice. You will notice in recent charts that I have placed EUR/JPY beneath EUR/USD, and EUR/NZD is beneath EUR/AUD. The reason for this is that USD and JPY have synchronicity when EUR moves against them, and likewise with AUD and NZD. When one moves so does the other. It may seam like watching paint dry to non believers, but watch them and you'll see what I mean. Happy pairs watching.

Heads up you Guys. I have just taken a snap of the four pairs I traded this morning for the 8 am scalp. Now look at what happened over the course of the day. EUR is on a rally. Some say its because of the French presidential election. Whatever it is, its causing confidence in the EUR to rise rapidly. I will admit that I was a little cautious this morning and exited all my trades with a good profit above the target of 100 pips. But these rallies are suggesting that it would be advantageous to exit one trade on each pair with a scalp profit and leave one position running with a target of 100 and a trailing stop of 25 pips. What do you say? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Personally, I believe that they are doing to the Euro what they did to the Pound. Just before the referendum. If you look at the charts for the Pound. They drove it up all night long and then they sell sell sell everyone jumps on the bus and the pound goes down. That brings me to the Euro the night before the election, which was a Sunday night the euro jumped up and I believe it's going to carry on going up until the election. At which point if mrs la pen wins they can drive it down sell sell sell. They have nothing to lose because they've already drove it up. Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Tellboy the 100 pip target is a great idea but i think a trailing stop will cut the profits alot. It should be better to set the stop at 25+ to be and eventually at +50 to 20 because most of the trades will need some time to fill the target. Today as example we got a big retrace in every currency we´re trading with a stop at be the target would be hit. with a stop lets say every 20 pips behind the price we got stoped out. If im wrong please correct me.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I agree. I have adjusted my trailing stops to 25/100 to see how useful it is under current conditions. Trailing stops are always tricky, and I think its better to move the stop up manually if you are sitting in front of the chart. But for those who have to leave their workstation for another profession, only trial and error will provide a working T/S strategy. It's all a matter for personal preference.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes like you said a few post before, the strength of the move definite the Stop and target and when we have to get out. time will tell whats the best management. But glued to the charts is never the best opinion^^ if we can catch some 100 pip winners a week we have a big edge and that very constantly. A day like today with 3x 100 Pip winner would be a 15R day and that is really huge if you ask me. An Idea could be. We put our target at the highest or deepest Pivot for the day for example. But sometime the pivot is not 100 pips away from the entry.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I think you are right. The big banks can manipulate these currencies and exploit the political sentiment. I am seriously considering opening a long position at the next pullback and just let it run until it spikes up before the banks pull the rug and sell short. We need to keep an eye on the French news.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Jamie, Sorry for the late reply. I only trade mornings and have other things to do during the day. In answer to your question, I use pivots as one of the trend measuring tools on the 30 M time frame where they are plotted for every day. Look at my examples. Then on the lower time frame chart, the daily pivot is often used as a platform to bounce the pullback off. I used to call this strategy the 'daily pivot bounce', but it doesn't happen every time, especially when the pullback is too weak to reach it. The important use of the daily pivot is that it marks a significant support level for pullbacks early in the day. When price is above the pivot and MAs are rising then its usually safe to go long. That's why I use daily pivots. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Good morning EUR scalpers. Here is the 30 M chart at 6 am (GMT). Watch for the pullback. See the lower chart for the outcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The 15 M chart at 08:40 shows how a pullback can go a long way down due to profit taking. This is the value of placing a buy stop order above the last bar on a 5 M or 15 M time frame chart. When the move carries on down it means you don't get stopped out with the pullback. But there is more: When the buy stop is not triggered, we could see all pairs settle back down to a support level after the recent rally. Therefore be very cautious. In retrospect lets have another look at the 15 M chart showing price action at 7:45. This last bar, just prior to the 8 am bar is the real key . On all charts where the 8 am spike is long it will be noticed that the 7:45 bar is edging to the upside, but this morning it edged to the downside which in fact indicated a bearish down spike at 8 am. Where we can be deceived into thinking that the 8 am move will be in line with bullish expectations, the 7:45 bar will tell us the truth . When it moved down it is not a pullback. Pullbacks occurr from the 7 am up move and retrace where we place a buy stop above each preceding bar in order to catch the 8 am bull spike. But when the stop is not triggered then we can witness what we thought was a pullback turning into a retracement. Critical price action traders will catch this move with a short trade. I wasn't paying attention and missed it. We'll take another look at the EUR/USD further down this thread. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good morning. No pivot to bump off?

Let's have a closer look at what happened with EUR/USD this morning. When the buy stop is not triggered on the pullback, we could see some pairs settle back down to a support level after the recent rally. Therefore be very cautious. In retrospect lets have another look at the 15 M chart showing price action at 7 am. This bar is the real key . On all charts where the 8 am spike is long it will be noticed that the 7:45 bar is edging to the upside, but this morning it plunged to the downside, crossing the 20 MA which in fact indicated a bearish down spike at 8 am. Where we can be deceived into thinking that the 8 am move will be in line with bullish expectations, the 7:45 bar will tell us the truth . When it moved down it is not a pullback. Pullbacks occurr from the 7 am up move and retrace where we place a buy stop above each preceding bar in order to catch the 8 am bull spike. But when the 7 am bar is bearish and the stop is not triggered then we can witness what we thought was a pullback turning into a retracement. Critical price action traders will catch this move with a short trade. I wasn't paying attention and missed it. In future, after a strong rally up to a previous high, look at the 7 am signal, then the bear bar crossing the 20 MA with a vengeance and then the down move of 75 pips. It isn't subtle. It's a strong signal to go short on this pair. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A powerful down move can crash right through the pivot. See the chart above.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
EUR synchronicity has returned after the retracement on the EUR/USD yesterday. Is that a precursor to a retracement across all EUR pairs?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Here are three charts for this morning, showing the synchronicity of a continued move to the upside on the first chart - the 30 M. Changing to a 5 M chart (2nd chart) to check the 6 and 7 am signals. All MAs are in sync with the low strength in the list, so these indicators suggest a move to the downside from the major trend. Price continued to fall until the 7:30 bar was the turning point to indicate that the pullback from the major trend on the 30 M chart had reached its bottom. On the final outcome we have a 15 M chart showing the outcome. We can see that the EUR/AUD pivot provided an excellent support. Confirmation of a bull spike at 8 came with the 7:45 bull bar. These three charts clearly illustrate the principle of a retracement from the major trend that can suggest a move to the downside, but in reality is a pullback that presents us with a good opportunity to go long with the major trend.

Thank you for the suggestion. I will be posting a full week's activity on my selected EUR pairs at the weekend showing the value of the indicators I use, and more importantly the significant pullback entry points for each day. It already looks interesting and informative, but we still have one more day's trading before the weekend. I will post my 30 M charts in the morning for you all to see what we are dealing with. Happy trading to all.

Thank you for getting back to me so quickly. I've been trying to find a currency meter like yours. All week. I know you trade with IC market and they give you the currency meter with your trading platform. I trade with tickmill mt4 because their spread is only one point on eur/usd. Trouble is, without a currency meter I can't trade the way you describe. Looking forward to your charts and any tips you may have at weekend. Thank you

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I am testing the value of currency metres as a tool in an entry strategy, and I am becoming increasingly sceptical of their true value, as we shall see when I post the entry points for scalps for the week. On the point of pip spreads , even with a spread of 4 or 5 pips, this is reduced when entering a trade when its relatively quiet, and what does it matter anyway if you are going to make anything between 20 to 50 pips on a single scalp?

Here is the opening scenario on the 30 M time frame for 6 am Friday 28th April 2017, followed by a 5 M chart with the outcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the information colected during the course of this past week, we are able to discuss the follow: The usefullness of a currency strength indicator. The use of major support and resistance (indicated by the horizontal purple lines). What determines the decision on the direction to trade. The key bar to indicate the direction of the coming spike. When to enter the trade. Have a pleasant weekend.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Here are the 30 M charts for the week for discussion, showing the trade entry signals. What I find most interesting is that the 7 am bar is the key that indicates the scalp move to take. During the course of this past week there was only one short trade indicated. The upper chart shows four selected pairs for the whole week. The lower chart EUR/USD, which is used as the major pair key (meaning that when this pair moves so do the others) is presented on its own.

Let's have a review and discussion on price action for scalping the EUR during the past week. It can be seen on all charts above that the 7 am candle is the key to the direction of the forthcoming spike to be scalped. It can also be seen that on one occassion (Weds) the spike is in a counter-trend direction that turned out to be a significant retracement all the way back to major support. This down move was precipitated by reaching the major resistance at 10,950 and a double top. A high reading on the currency strength indicator can often indicate a sharp return to the downside. This can create confusion, non-entry or a loss if the retracement is misconstrued as a possible pullback, and it is these situations that we need to resolve if we are to make our pip target every day. It is these, and similar occassions when the direction of the potential spike is not clearly indicated, that we have to be very cautious and wait to see what the 7 am candle on a 5 M chart has to say. Therefore, during the coming week I shall capture the 7 am candle the moment it occurs and post it to the thread asp. At the close of each session I shall post the result for the day showing the potential trade outcome with a measurement of pips scored and the time taken. Then, at the end of the week I shall post the week's findings with all entry and exit points and the pips scored. During the coming week use your paper trading account and see how well it compares with the end-of-week report posted here. Any comments or suggestions are welcomed. Have a good weekend.

Hi Tellboy. Thank you for posting your strategy. English isn't my native language so excuse me for possible mistakes. I have a question about some aspect of your strategy: what's the point of basket trading in this particular case? It means, if you want to trade on EUR morning breakout, and you choose 4 pairs to trade, each one with "x" lots entry. Isn't it preferable simply to trade EURUSD (as more volatile than EURAUD for example) and make "4x"lots entry?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
That's good question. The reason is that sometimes, when the USD is strong, EUR/USD doesn't breakout, but all the other pairs do. There is an example of this I posted on 19th April in this thread to illustrate it. Thank you for asking.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Monday 1st May. Bank holiday in the UK, and the 30 M chart shows EUR/USD in the bottom half of the currency strenth list. AUD is strong and JPY is weakest. Synergy between the pairs indicates them all edging sideways and showing no signs of trending yet. Therefore there are no signals for us to take an interest, so let's see what happens anyway. Here's the chart at just before 6 am (GMT+1). The lower chart is the 5 M time frame illustrating the inconsistancy in the market. It is only when there is uniformity that the signals to trade are in sync. Notice the inconsistancy in the 7 am 'truth' candle. When they are pointing in opposite directions there is too much risk in opening any position. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi tellboy you got a great thread going on here. One Question when you look at the '7 am' truth candle which time frame do you use?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
5 M is the simple answer, but it can also be seen on 10 or 15. Even better on the 30 M - see the next post.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
As a matter of interest, here is the value of the 'truth' candle at 7 am on the 30 M time frame even when there is no synchronicity between the pairs on the left EUR/USD, EUR/JPY and the pairs on the right EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD. It can clearly be seen that the USD and JPY move in tandem against the EUR, as do the AUD and NZD. Interesting isn't it? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here is a good example of when to stay out of the trade. Firstly, on the 30 M chart there is no uniformity in the shape and trends of all four pairs. (Ignore the currency strengths in the list on the left of the charts because this was not captured at 6 am). There is inconsistancy in the patterns between those on the left and those on the right of the 30 M charts. Secondly there was a surprise bull spike on EUR/USD and EUR/JPY at 6 am. Thirdly, looking at the 15 M charts below we can see that there is inconsistancy in the 7 am candle. There was a bull candle on EUR/JPY, EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD, but not on the EUR/USD, which is our key pair. The bull candle on the AUD and NZD was far too close to a resistance level on their retracement from a strong downtrend overnight. We should only take notice when there is consistancy in all pairs with the 7 am 'truth' candle, by using the EUR/USD as our benchmark. With no synchronised price action on these three essential criteria, this all indicates to remain out of the market. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thank you for your reply. Also i am getting the hang of '7 am' truth candle and how to plan the trade depending on the synchronicity of that candle with all four pairs, wanted to ask then what about the '7:45 am' candle should we ignore it or is it of any value?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
The idea is to catch the upward move with a buy stop order after 7 am. A succesful move will show at 7:45 and it should be safe to enter.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
My entry EURAUD, also EURNZD rally did move really well great breakout also.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
We had a choice today due to the strength of USD and weakness of AUD. All EUR pairs were at the top of the strength list, but there was inconsistancy between the pairs on the left and those on the right. With the knowledge that USD, JPY and CAD move in sync against EUR, I substituted NZD with CAD. The lower illistration shows the 5 M charts with the 7 am 'truth' candle and the final outcome if those candles were followed. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I like this system but a few questions: If at 6:30 GMT the EUR/USD is in the upper quadrant The trend is up so you are looking for long trades BUT the 7:00 truth bar red/bearish what do you do? Do you only take the pairs that have bullish truth candles for long trades?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
In such circumstances there is a choice, as was clearly illustrated today. When the EUR/USD is high on the list and the trend has reached a new high or a significant level of resistance we can expect it to retrace. The first good indicator of a retracement is about 6 am with the first bear candle. It would be wise to place a sell stop order below in order to catch the 7 am bear candle. Conversely, the AUD and NZD were still in an upward trend and if this is the choice then it would be wise to place a buy stop order to catch the 7 am bull candle. I hope this makes it clear.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Where should we place the buy or stop orders? Is it at the start of 8 am candle?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
No. The 7 am candle points in the direction of the trade. You can wait for a sight pullback from the 7 am candle to place your stop order or enter straight after it. The objective is to catch the 8 am scalp. If you wait for it you may miss it or get caught with a wide spread.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
At 6:30 am (GMT) check the currency strengths using a simple H/L leader list as shown in the example chart below. If the EUR/USD is in the upper quadrant of the list and is seen to be rising since midnight (GMT+1) the indication is to go long. If the pair is in the lower quadrant then the indication is to go short. Best results are when the EUR pairs are grouped together at the top (for long trades) or at the bottom (for short trades). I guess there is some flexibility to the steps. I've taken only taken trades when all the steps check out. If the EUR is strong, I have only gone long and only took long trades on the pairs that showed a bullish candle at the 5min 7am. I've done well just following them, just refining the strategy. Thanks Tellboy!!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Here is another example of where there is conflict and indecision in the market, which is not ideal for scalping on all four pairs with this system. The 30 M charts shows non-synchronicity in the trend patterns with the 100 MA as our guide. EUR/USD shows a retracement from a low up towards the daily pivot, so we could expect a down move to resume the direction of the 100 MA. EUR/JPY is touching a resistance level. As USD and JPY tend to move in sync with each other against EUR we could expect EUR/JPY to go short. The conflict comes in with the weakness in the AUD and NZD. The conflict is the high probability that EUR/USD and EUR/JPY will short, but EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD are indicating a continued up move. Further conflict is shown in the differences in the 7 am candles of AUD and NZD. Under these circumstances the wise scalper would stay out, but the risk taker would place a sell stop order below EUR/USD and EUR/JPY. The lower 15 M chart shows where price on these two pairs broke the 5 M MA to give a short scalp prior to 8 am. Indecision in the market at 8 am maintained price on all pairs in a holding position.

Tellboy, thank you for your answer. Now it's clear.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
With three of our pairs, EUR/USD, EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD touching a new high this morning at a significant resistance level, a retracement was no suprise. See the upper chart taken at 6 am. The 7 am candle, shown on the lower 5 M charts was true to form as it indicated the down move on all pairs. Best returns are shown on EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD. So, what lessons can we learn from today? Whe price reached a new high at a significant resistance level it is a good indication to retrace. The 7 am candle is the 'truth' indicator. Trust it.

Here are the 30 M charts for the four selected pairs for the past week showing the 7 am candle for each pair on each day. This will enable us to discuss the value of the 7 am candle as it apears on the 30 M charts. We could pose the following questions, bearing in mind that the objective is a morning scalp and not a long-term trade for the day: What is the value of a bear candle at 7 am on a rising trend? What value are conflicting candles on different pairs? The lower chart shows the value of following the 7 am candle for EUR/USD alone.

Hi there EUR scalpers. Here are the charts for this morning, Monday 8th May 2017. You could not ask for a better example of this strategy at work. This is how it looks when the best trades are made. Is this worthy of discussion or what? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #105 ---
There is no doubt. Using your currency meter gives you an advantage. The trouble I have and probably some of the others. We are all trading using MT4. And we do not have a currency meter. And the two currency meters I have been using are not that good. I think to trade your method you have to use your broker. I think you said it was IC markets . The trouble is I have found there demo site not to my liking but that's just my opinion, I will still carry on watching your thread. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I've been demo trading this strategy and I love it! but a few things: 1. I've been using the 5min candle at 7am as the truth bar but I find I'm missing a lot of the trades. Last night the EURUSD 5 min candle at 7am painted a doji so I didn't take trades. 2. Sometimes the pairs are in the top quadrant but the 7am truth bar indicates you should go short. Vice versa. So I'm conflicted and decide not to take trades. 3. Sometimes 1 pair is not synchronized with the other pairs so I end up not taking any trades. I think one pair last night appeared to be trending up to me so again I didn't take any trades.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Perfect charts there are so many pips to grab if you guys traded with these charts. Love this strategy. Thanks tellboy.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
dont really need the strength meter really but just focus on the the '7am' candle and the how the charts sync with each other.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
use the 30m for '7am' candle.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
The charts posted by the OP are from IG Markets. I used them some years ago before moving to MT4 brokers. I much prefer MT4. We just need peeps that are MT4 traders to post their charts using this idea, so that we can make it work on MT4. Price movement is the same after all. Can I confirm I have marked your 7am candle correctly using a GMT +3 broker? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #111 ---
The example charts I posted yesterday illustrated a perfect performance of this strategy. Now, today we have a perfect example of conflicting signals that tell us to stay out and avoid any risk. There are a few issues and questions that need to be addressed, and I will be addressing them when time permits, but right now I am travelling from UK to the US and may not be able to find the time. Meanwhile please feel free to comment on the value of a currency strength meter and the value of co-ordinated or conflicting signals at 7 am. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I stopped using MT4 because I didn't like it, but you can still use all the same indicators like moving averages and pivot points, etc. One of the reasons I prefer IG Index, is because of the currency pair list that shows the strongest to weakest pairs. It is a great help as the first indicator, but it isn't the be-all and end-all. More important is the trend synchronicity between the pairs. See yesterday's (Monday 8th May) for a perfect example of what I mean about trend synchronicity. They are all the same. Now compare that with what happened today (Tues 9th May) and see just how different the trend patterns are on those four pairs. Today was a day to keep out because the trends were not in sync and the 7 am candles showed conflict and indecision in the market. You may also notice that I did not show the currency pair strength list for Monday, and there was a very good reason for that. All EUR pairs showed strength at the top of the list, and that is an indication to go long. BUT, when price reached a new high and a significant resistance level there is a very high probability that price will fall and you need to go short, and that is precisely what happened. This is why I am constantly asking the question 'what is the value of a currency strength meter'?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
The 15 M candle at 7 am is the best in my opinion. It absorbs 'noise' of the 5 m time frame and gives a clearer and more positive signal. The 30 M time frame is too long and it leaves the entry too late.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
It 'looks' right because the correct candle is indicated, but I am confused by the time on your chart. My 7 am candle is at GMT+1 (British Summer time). Does this help?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
It is wise to stay out of the trade when there is conflict and indecision. Don't be disheartened if you think you see a missed opportunity. It is better to avoid the risk if you are undecided. Now look at the example of Monday 8th May for just how good it can turn out when all the strategic steps are followed. These trades don't happen every day, but when they do you will see it now that you know what to look for.

Me saying GMT +3 didn't help as it becomes GMT +2 with your British Summer Time. I would seem to align with redfan though, rather than seeing GMT +1. Not that it matters so long as we line up the same candle you are using. I concur with your thoughts on currency strength meters and find it more useful to look at "currency sync". I have been looking for Eur, Jpy or USD pairs to be in sync, to see which currency is dominant, be it strength or weakness. I am interested in your idea for watching a particular time, ie 7am bar for the euro. If I have my times right (as above) this is one hour before the UK opens and when the German market opens?

Just looking at your charts. I thought that we synchronised EUR/USD with EUR/JPY it appears you have the EUR/USD with EUR/CAD?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Yes, I do that sometimes to see of there is synchronicity with CAD. Sometimes it is a better pair than with JPY. We have to be flexible. This is why robots don't work. There has to be flexibility built into the system or if its too rigid there will be too few opportunities. This morning there was no synchronicity anywhere, so it was not wise to take a trade.

Let's have a quick look at the EUR/USD 30 M chart for the past week. It shows us why we have had a flat week with so few possible trades. The pair has been trundling along in a non-productive sideways channel. This can't go on, so let's see what next week brings. I have placed alerts to let us know when price breaks out of the channel.

Hello Tellboy, I must commend you for being active at the age of 70. This strategy is different yet similar to the london open straddle, which from my experience wins 60 % of the time with a 1:1 risk (excluding spread). So it is slow, yet reliable in the long run in my opinion. How does your strategies results match up so far to those numbers?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I must confess that I have only just returned to trading after a long absence. I therefore have no record of reliability. You have reminded me that this is something I should give my attention to. Thank you for the reminder.

I wonder if someone could make a EA basket of four pairs, so you could pick any four pairs you wanted in the EA basket. For instance. EUR/USD EUR/JPY EUR/AUD EUR/NZD It would work like this, Pick 4 pairs that are synchronised. Allow it to trade automatically at any time You pick. London open New York open for instance, The EA would automatically detect when your 4 pairs were at the top of the list In the currency meter, it would also detect the 50 moving average. So if the moving average was above the price it would be a sell trade and below the price a buy trade, So if you're four pairs were at the top of the list. and the 50 moving average below the price, It would place 4 X buy trades with trailing stop, Allow it to automatically close any one of the pairs . If that pairs started to go down the list. Or the moving average go against it, It would be nice if the EA had money management break even. Sell 4 X trades would be generated if you're four pairs were at the bottom of the list, and the moving average above the price allowing the EA to close anyone of the the pairs Also allow it to be manually traded using three buttons (Buy button) (Sell botton) (Close button). All with the same rules as above, I believe synchronisation is important and we will have to find the best pairs that mirror each other. Just an idea I live in hope

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I see that a lot has been written on other threads concerning EAs for basket trading. You may like to investigate them to find out what works and what doesn't. Good luck in your search.

Here are two sets of charts for the EUR pairs this morning. The first shows the situation at about 6:30 and the lower shows the outcome. We can see that there is inconsistency between the pairs on the left and the pairs on the right. This means it is not a good day to trade the scalp for the EUR. That is unless you wanted to trade in the direction of the 7 am candle and catch scalps in both directions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #142 ---
A very nice set up this morning resulting in a good series of scalps. See the set up on the first set of charts, followed by the outcome on the lower set. There was some inconsistency with the 7 am candle on the 15 M time frame, but EUR/USD paved the way with the correct direction. This is an excellent example of how good the system is if the rules are followed. Caution is needed when EUR/USD reaches a significant resistance level, as it did this morning, but when the pair held its position and did not retrace then all the signs were in place for a good set of bull scalps that enabled the target of 100 pips to be easily exceeded. Entry on all pairs should always be executed with stop orders, just in case. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello Tellboy,i tried this stuff out last week friday till today...positive returns so far,i made 300+ pips today only. my observation is that you are limiting yourself by placing too many rules...do's and don't. i will post how i use your idea around 5am to 7am Gmt+1,that's the period i check the currency performance and also when i also enter the trade. NICE ONE.

Thanks for posting and explaining the charts everyday tellboy. Monday and Tuesday charts were beautiful to trade and make loads of pips, today on the other hand was a obvious 'stay out' shout but still managed a few pips. Strategy works great can't remember the last time i lost using this system kind of gives a direction to trade the rest of the day '7 am' candle is gold.

from the pics,the marked painted red area shows usd to be showing good and strong performance while only the circled audusd area is the only place where usd wasn't showing good performance...the yellow marked painted area shows where jpy seem to be showing weak performance across the board. now that made me chose to trade usdjpy which is marked later with a green too. i will just have to wait for a buy opportunity. Now,as at the time of typing this price was at 111.01...i am not supposed to buy here but rather 110.80. now lets assume i bought now at 111.01 which i just did. i hope this works now,that's how i have been using this...to add other pairs,i just look at stronger performing pair and cross with the jpy pair like that AUD and EUR. i will just long uj,aj and ej.

Today's conflicting 7 am candles gave a good indication of the sideways price action to come for the day. There were no useful price moves from 7 to 8 where we could grab a scalp. The first group of charts shows the inconsistency between the pairs, and the lower charts show the inconsistency with the 7 am candles. Therefore these charts illustrate when price channels sideways and when there is little profit to be had with speculation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is a review of EUR/USD for this week so far on the 30 M time frame where we can see the value of the 7 am candle to predict a good scalp. The 7 am candle let us down on only one day (Wednesday) when it was out of sync with the 7 am candle on the other three pairs (not shown). For me this clearly illustrates the value of the 7 am candle for scalping when it is synchronized with other EUR pairs. Some of you may also be aware of the value of the 7 am candle in predicting a longer trade with a higher target of 50 or 100 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

i waited too long before closing the trade because i was up around 80pips on the 3 trades before moving to b.e ...i will just have a set target of 50pips daily with this style of trading while still trend trading the way i trade. This idea by tellboy is perfect.

Here are the charts for Friday 19th May. Where there may be indecision it may be wise to stay with a 30 M time frame and use the 7 am candle for a definitive direction if all pairs agree at 7 to 7:30 am. The first set of charts show the situation at 06:30 (GMT+1), and the lower set shows the outcome where I made a total of £187. This confirms the value to me of the 7 am candle on a 30 M time frame, together with the patience to let the positions run on for the day.

How do you manage your trade? Do you have a trailing stop or use a strict profit target? Was testing this on the 15 minute chart at the time of entry and used 2:1 (20 stop / 40 target) and it would have hit my targets. Strategy works very well if you're patient and don't try to force the synch between the charts. Interested to see how to manage this to get the most profit. Will look at testing this all next week before putting on a live trade.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi there Doanut. The answer to your question is all a matter of personal preference. I usually expect a scalp of 25 pips on each pair, but USD often gives the lowest whilst AUD and NZD can give more. Lately I am opening two positions, one with a 25 pip target that is adjusted to just below the next resistance level and the other with a 100 pip target for a longer all-day trade if momentum is present. I never use a trailing stop, and prefer to shift my stop manually.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Monday 22nd May and the 7 am candle on all four pairs stays true to form with its prediction of direction. But going short against the major trend can be a bit scary, and there aren't usually too many pips to be gained unless the USD is particularly strong. This morning it was the NZD that showed its strength, followed by the AUD. Conservative scalpers would have stayed out, and brave ones would have taken the shorts. Once again this strategy demonstrates the value of synchronicity between pairs and the validity of the 7 am candle, especially on the 30 M time frame. Trust it.

EUR pairs have lost their synchronicity as this morning's charts will testify. Where there is no synchronicity the risks are too high and it is best to stay out of the market.

Hi, Thought I would test this methodology. Today's EUR pairs didn't look that great so I tried GBPUSD, GBPJPY, GBPNZD and GBPAUD. I put pending orders below the 8:00 am candles and let it run. All triggered except GBPJPY and yielded 25 pips each. A very encouraging result so I will test some more next week before committing any real money.

Here is a review of this past week for EUR/USD showing how the pair is stuck in a sideways channel. A breakout from this channel should give us some synchronicity to trade with. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GBPJPY would have triggered in the US session and hit profit but I had deleted the order.

Here are the charts for Monday 29th May, which is a bank holiday in the UK. All indicators point to a bearish EUR, so we would be looking to go short when the 7 am candles indicate so. However, we can see that there is inconsistency in the 7 am candles, and this would suggest a retracement against the main trend. These indicators suggest staying out of trading. Let us remind ourselves of the essential criteria for successful trades - all indicators need to be synchronized in agreement. The charts below illustrate the principle clearly.

Good morning Tellboy when looking at 7 AM candle on your charts. Is it the candle with the arrow pointing to it. Thank you

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Yes. The arrow points to the 7 am candle and indicates its direction.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Are you always basing the 7 am candle on the 30 minute time frame? i.e. you will not get confirmation of this candle until 7:30?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Tellboy waiting for your analysis regarding todays charts. eurusd and eurjpy were nicely synchronised today m15 m30 were bearish still price went up?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I think that there's been a lot of Euro positive news flow today. That can change the picture in a hurry

--- 帖子 #181 ---
It might be the reason for that upward move other than that its a very strange up move in a strong downward trend on the eurusd

--- 帖子 #182 ---
It looks like EUR may have touched a bottom and is on the rise again. This morning showed strength coming back into the EUR. The 7 am candle showed its directional value on EUR/USD and EUR/JPY, but a strong NZD held that pair back. Not much momentum in the market today, but 63 pips captured.

Thursday 1st June 2017. Not a good day for scalping the EUR today due to resistance levels on all pairs and bearish candles at 7 am on all pairs. Remember the essential criteria are that the 7 am candles should be synchronized with the direction of the main trend. Going short against the trend is always tricky and can take too long to gain any profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Are you using any other indicators to determine the trend, The reason I'm asking is EUR/USD we started with a red candle at 7 o'clock, and apart from the green candle at 7:30 o'clock it carried on going down, The EUR/JPY just seem to go sideways till 1 o'clock and then we had a blip and now it's back sideways movement, I know the rules say these two pairs should be synchronised, but it's pretty hard to stay out of the trade. Anyway, thanks for your great work. I've learnt a lot from the synchronisation of these two pairs, hope you keep the good work up, thank you

--- 帖子 #185 ---
The major trend is determined by the 30 M time frame. When there is synchronicity with the 30 M time frame on all pairs is when we can expect a synchronized move on all pairs at 7 am on the 15 M time frame. This is the true measure of a good signal for entering the trades. However, where there is no synchronicity on the 30 M time frame and when the 7 am candles are out of sync with each other is a significant indication to stay out of the market. Below is a another good example of when to stay out. Note : For clarification on when to enter for good scalps it may be helpful to go back through this thread for a revision on how good indicators look. Charts for Friday 2nd June 2017.

It has been a tricky week with lots of indecision in the market for EUR. Here is a snapshot of the week for EUR/USD showing the best opportunity on Wednesday for a 25 pip scalp. It may also be useful to note the sharp retracement spike on Tuesday that signaled a strong bounce back to the upside. These sharp dips are always very useful to look out for. Have a good weekend.

Hi there, interesting thread. There was just a couple of things that I'm not sure about. I've read through the whole thread but it seems that the ruleset is a bit unclear. From what I can gather; - You are looking at the strength meter for EUR pairs to be high for bullish trades and low for bearish but this isn't too important if the 30 min trends are aligned. - You look at the 30 min and are looking for your 4 pairs to be trending in the same direction - You normally use 5 or more commonly 15 min charts for entry - You are looking for a 7am bar and you are looking for all charts to agree - You then enter with a buy or sell stop above the high or low of this bar Is this right? One thing that confuses me though is that it seems like you don't always use exactly the 7:00am bar, sometimes it is the 6:55am bar (for example on your trades on May 5th). Is this something that you'll do on the 5min chart only and are you looking for a significant bar between 6 and 7, or 7 and 8? Or must it be within 10 mins of 7am? Or was this a mistake? The other thing that you seem to do is that if there is not a trend in the same direction on all of your charts you will still enter a trade if you can see agreement with the 7am candles on the 30 min timeframe and this is the only time you'll use 30 min for the entry bar. Is this accurate? Thanks for the thread, and I look forward to testing this.

There are too many questions here for me to answer in one go. Your own discretion and choice of time frame, from your own experience of paper trading this system will answer your own questions. Suffice it to say that each day teaches us a new lesson about this trading system. Opportunities for good trades are fewer than we would like them to be, and this system teaches us when to stay out of the market as much as it teaches us when to take a trade. Today, Monday 5th June is a good example of where conflicting signals tell us to stay out of the market. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Tuesday 6th June. There is no synchronicity for EUR today. Both NZD and JPY are showing strength in the market. I am staying out again today. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Although this thread is primarily focused on scalping the EUR pairs, the strategy works perfectly well for all other pairs. Today, Tuesday 6th June is a perfect example of the strategy working with NZD pairs. Notice how all NZD pairs are grouped together at the top of the currency strength list and how they are all synchronized. There was a pullback from 7:15 to 7:45 when the rally continued on all pairs. Earlier observations of how the NZD moves suggests that the rally will continue for the rest of the day. This is good for traders who like to run with their positions.

Wednesday 7th June. The day started with a bull news spike for AUD which paved the way for a serious move to the downside for all EUR pairs. Look at the currency pairs strength list on the left of the charts below. It will clearly be seen that all AUD pairs are grouped together at the top of the list. This simple fact is a clear indication that the AUD is going to lead the market today.

Hi Tellboy Thanks for the thread, I have only traded it for the last 3 mornings but the results are very promising. Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Terence! Great system you have here. I've been testing it for the last couple of weeks with great results. I usually check up to 6 EUR pairs and select the most promising ones (same trends, same 7am candles,etc) I usually end up working with just 4 pairs just like you, never more than that. But sometimes I get just 2 or 3 pairs with the right indications and leave the other ones out and it works. So I Wanted to ask you this: Why do you need 4 pairs to match (the trend, and 7 am candle) and not just trade 3 pairs for example if they meet the criteria?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi Attached is this mornings trade which was successful, if i could grow a pair of balls and let them run a little longer it would have been even more successful. Not sure it would meet all your criteria but it does seem to be working.Morning routine as follows. 1 Check for any news release 2 Check which currency is strongest/weakest 3 look for similar patterns across chosen currency on 30m 4 wait for 30 min candle to agree with strength table 5 place stop orders on 5 min chart above/below pull back 20SL 25TP 6 Monitor trade. (Then lose your bottle when chart looks a little bearish and cash early)this bit needs work. Thanks again for the system

Thursday 8th June. Following yesterday's bear move for EUR pairs, today sees a consolidating sideways channel along the 11,250 support level for EUR/USD. Notice the conflicting 7 am candles that indicate indecision in the market. This is yet another very good example of when to remain out of the market and not take any risks.

In answer to your question - it is entirely up to you. You seem to be making the right choices, and it is refreshing to hear from someone who uses their own initiative and is not reliant on a robotic system. We all need to think for ourselves.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
This is an excellent summary of the strategy. Nice one.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Excellent! I would like to add two things: 1/ Start early (if you're in Europe!) around 6.30am is good 2/ One can trade the pull backs by using an EA with SL, TS and TP set up so that you can't chicken out because it's all automated. I use it because I have the same problem I use this currency strength indi which is constantly on my chart and it works really well (attached)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
With a Target of only 25 pips is it really worth the effort to add a trailing stop? I do add a 10 pip trailing stop only after it has hit 50 pips (this way I know I would have locked at least 2%). I do add the following to the strategy: - Move the entry on the close of each 5-minute candle until it triggers. (more management, but ensures you enter at the lowest point possible to give your trade enough room to breathe). - Use the 30M chart to confirm synchronicity across the pairs. - Set a soft target at 40 pips (2:1) and if prices continue to move in the direction move your stop once it hits 50 pips with 10 pip trailing stop. - Swap out pairs if required to get sync as the strategy is very flexible. - Happy to trade 2 or 3 if they are in sync. You don't need all 4. - Draw key support/resistance on the charts and don't trade directly into them. Thanks to @tellboy for the strategy. It has really added another dimension to my trading.

An end of week review of EUR/USD is always useful to see how valuable the 7 am candle is as a primary indicator. Most days in this past week showed indecision for EUR at 7 am, except for Tuesday. For all other days the significant price movements came later during the morning. So, for the 7 - 8 am scalper, is this information useful? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Enjoy your weekend.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Tellboy, Just to clarify, I saw strength in EUR base on the currency strength meter. However the 7am bar on the 30 mins chart for all 4 pairs were a bearish candle. Can you explain how you decide to long these pairs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #209 ---
That's a tricky one to answer. Sometimes the 7 am candle can indicate the pullback. To be safe it is wise to place the buy stop order above the last bar close on a 5 m time frame. If the pullback turns out to be a retracement then you will stay out. Quite often the strength of a move on any one of the pairs and the momentum will give an entry on the buy stop. Then all others will follow. It's all a matter of learning through experience. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thanks for the feedback. So I'm guessing we should follow the currency strength direction as priority followed by 7am candle.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Correct, that is unless the down move is very strong, as often happens when price reaches a new high or a significant resistance level. Check back through this thread for examples.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Tuesday 13th June. Strong bear moves can be halted with a retracement at significant support levels, as today's example illustrates. On all four pairs shown below, the 7 am candle indicated a reversal to the upside. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good morning tellboy. Im following this thread with interest because I never had a " Lo-open"system that works. Your rules are good to handle and well written IMO. The intraday system I use is MA based and starts after london open.( the dance/Choros) I also have a couple of questions: When " 7am/true candle " is pointing in the other direction dont you stay "out" and wait for a good entry the coming days? No need to be in the market when the conditions are not given or ? "quote page 1 of this thread" EUR is strong against all other currencies for long trades. (Weakest for short trades). All chosen EUR pairs are trending in the same direction. The 7 am candle for each selected pair on a 5, 10 or 15 M time frame are all pointing in the same direction (up for longs and down for shorts)." The yesterdays entry wasn t a entry by rules, or am I wrong? - Specially this question I tried to ask per PM to bring no imbalance to your nice thread. (but its not possible.. private settings) So what entry would you recomment for today? Stay tuned Guido

--- 帖子 #214 ---
The conservative trader would stay out because the 7 am candle is in opposition to the main trend. But the risk-taker may take the trade in the direction of the 7 am candles if they are all pointing in the same direction, as they did today which resulted in a very strong retracement against the main trend.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Thx for clarification, was helpful. Stay tuned Guido

Thursday 16th June. There was synchronicity with EUR/USD, EUR/CAD, EUR/JPY and EUR/AUD this morning, but with NZD falling out of sync. Application of the essential rules of the strategy today would have yielded a good result, as the charts below will testify. The trick is to place your stop entry in the direction of the trend below the pullback. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I don't quite see how there was a clear trade today? The 7 o'clock candles doesn't look particular bearish to me and doesn't look that synchronized either?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Friday 16th June. It is always a bit unnerving when a strong 7 am candle points against the main trend. EUR/JPY paved the way today and EUR/USD followed with a bit of momentum to cross the daily pivot. AUD and NZD were in conflict and therefore not good trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It is true that there is no telling when the circumstances are right for a good scalp, but when synchronicity is there, then it is guaranteed to give excellent results. It's a bit like fishing. You can sit by a river or pond all day and catch nothing, and on another day the fish are biting. If market dynamics were the same every day then we would all be millionaires, but market dynamics dictate that we must be patient and wait the for synchronicity to fall into place.

End of week, Friday 23rd June. It hasn't been a brilliant week for EUR scalping has it, but every day teaches us a new lesson. Have a look at this past week for the EUR/USD on the 30 m time frame and judge the value of the 7 am candle and its usefulness as a directional indicator relative to the major trend. Any thoughts anyone? I am on my way driving overland from UK to Crete. I wonder what you all are doing. Whatever it is - have a great weekend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Greece.. such a lovely place. Wish you a wonderful weekend as well Stay tuned Guido Yes.. the tuesday candlein EU. You are 30 min early. But all in all its a really nice and good view! EJ looks a bit different Stay tuned Guido

--- 帖子 #229 ---
The 7 am candle on the EUR/USD for Tuesday is worthy of note. It spiked up against the major trend, which was a good indicator that price would reverse back in line with the major trend. In fact, the 7 am candle turned out to be the pullback for a throw downwards. If we follow the rules and place our stop order above the 7 am candle (for a buy) then we will not be caught in a losing trade. But if we wait until 7:30 and follow market sentiment then we will scalp a short. That all depends, of course, if all other pairs are behaving in similar fashion. Remember, when EUR move against the USD it will normally do the same with JPY and others. Happy trading next week.

Good morning. I think you got me wrong.. Here´s the 7 am (GMT) candle .. I´m sure you wouldn t buy the 7 am candle on tuesday. You simply marked the 6.30 am candle.. but it´s one candle (30 min) too early. Stay tuned Guido

Can't really put a number on it. I had a week where 4 out of 5 days were good entries, then the week after nothing. Just stick to your guns and take profit consistently. I for one didn't see any synchronicity between the EUR, but today I did take GBP bucket. 15 minute time frame with the entry on 4pm (my 7am truth candle / 1 hour before london open) https://www.tradingview.com/x/sGEHwn5a/ I have a strict 2:1 (40 target / 20 stop). 3 hit target - +6% (120 pips) 1 hit loss - 1% (20 pips) Hope this helps.

Friday 30th June. A tricky day today with all EUR pairs on the bottom of the strength list indicating weakness.

Monday 3rd July and loads of conflict in the EUR market today. This chart was taken at 7:15 showing the conflicting signals of the 7 am candle on the 15 m charts. There is inconsistency in the major trends with the strong USD pushing EUR/USD down, but in conflict with EUR/JPY indicating a continuation to the upside. A weak NZD indicates EUR/NZD to the upside, but EUR/CAD wants to go down. Too much conflict and indecision means stay out of the market this morning. The fire emoji indicates staying our or you could get burned. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Tuesday 4th July and loads of conflict with the EUR pairs this morning. The whole scenario was pre-empted by a drop in EUR/USD and EUR/JPY at 6 am. By 7 am on the 15 m time frame price had bounced off significant support levels and the 7 am candles tentatively indicated a pullback to the upside against the main trend. ( Always tricky ). At the same time EUR/NZD and EUR/CAD, both trending down had hit support levels. Altogether this scenario would have been very risky to trade, so the advice here, with no synchronicity anywhere to be seen, would be to stay out and observe, or just go back to bed. Risk being burned if you trade this scenario. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Wednesday 5th July. EUR has been bearish for a week or so and may have reached a bottom at 11350 with EUR/USD. All pairs showing a swing across the 100 ma on the 15 m charts with EUR/JPY and EUR/NZD taking the lead, not with a strong EUR, but with weak JPJ and NZD. Look at the currency strength leader board to see the JPY and NZD weak against all other currencies. JPY and NZD would have been a good basket trade currencies today. The 7 am candles proved to be a reliable indicator, with the notable exception of EUR/NZD which actually turned out to be a good scalp from 8 am. (Sometimes we have to wait until 8 or after to catch the scalp). Not a bad day with a few small scalps taken. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thursday 6th July and it would appear that market dynamics have shifted our 7 am 'truth' candle to 7:30. The first indicator of a move to the upside was given by a universal weakness in the JPY at 6 am. It pulled back a touch until 7 am when it showed us a hammer. Confirmation of a bullish direction came at 7:30 on EUR/JPY and EUR/USD. Agreement came at 7:45 with EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD when it was time to enter trades with all four pairs. A good day.

Friday 7th July, and after the rally of yesterday little was expected for today. A weak NZD showed the first indication of a reinforcement to the upside at around 6 am where price bounced away from its daily pivot. The 7 am candle all indicated a bullish sentiment with the exception of the EUR/AUD due to a strong AUD. Pullbacks from AUD and NZD were a bit scary and required nerves of steel for those who took positions indicated by the 'slightly' bullish sentiment. Not a good scalping day, but it was worth a few pips for the cautious and patient who waited until after 8 am to take a little profit. I'll give this day just one Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is the end of week review for EUR/USD on a 30 m time frame. Notice the 7 am candles for their directional value. You may notice the a bearish bar at 6:30 often reverses to a bull bar at 7 and is then reinforced at 7:30. Correct me if I am wrong, but would it be wise to fade the 6:30 bear candle and go long to catch the 7 am bull bar and then go large with the reinforcement at 7:15 or 7:30? Worth a test next week?

Monday 10th July and a bit of a scary day for EUR scalpers. A strong AUD combined with a weak JPY put EUR pairs in conflict with each other and EUR/USD clinging between 11,400 and its daily pivot. This was a day for subtle price action on the positive sentiment of EUR traders at the open. Following strictly to the rules of the strategy we would be inclined to resist entering the market, but EUR/AUD gave us a hammer at 6:30 supported by a EUR/JPY bull candle at 6:30. Not a particularly good day for scalping, but EUR pairs are still rising as I write at 8:22. I'll give today just two Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I checked all 4 candles at 7.30 they were all red. The min we hit 8.00 They all turned green, at 8.30 they all turned red. I quickly bought at 8.00 and was out for 8.15 with a very good profit.

Tuesday 11th July. This was the scenario at 6 am this morning. We can see clear divergences in the synchronicity between USD and JPY and between AUD and NZD. I don't see any possibility of a clear trading direction from these patterns at this time, so I'm being cautious to watch what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is becoming increasingly evident that the EUR/JPY pair are an important indication of what is to come for other EUR pairs. A strong 7 am bull candle was supported by similar on the EUR/USD pair, even though it was, strictly speaking, counter-trend. The bull move was later reinforced by AUD and NZD at 7:45. So, by using caution with buy stops above the pullbacks on all pairs we came out with a reasonable profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Wednesday 12th July and EUR/USD reached spitting distance from a new high at 11,500 after yesterday's rally for all EUR pairs. Reaching a new high is usually a pretty sure sign that price will retrace to the downside, and EUR/JPY paved the way by plunging through its daily pivot overnight. Reinforcement of the down move came with 7 am candles on all pairs, that is after EUR/USD broke its 20 ma. It is always tricky when the indicators go against the main trend, but that's how market sentiment works and we have to go with the flow or stay out. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Friday 14th July and another scenario of mixed messages with no synchronicity in EUR pairs. When USD and JPY are out of sync with each other it is never a good sign. For EUR/USD and EUR/JPY the 7 am candle was indecisive whilst for AUD and NZD the signal was misleading in the immediate short term. These are all signals to not take any risks and stay out of the market. When there is no synchronicity and the indicators are undecided or giving mixed messages then it is always wise to exercise self-discipline and save your hard earned capital for a better day.

Are you able to elaborate on how AUD &amp; NZD was misleading? The two pairs looked very synchronised and followed the truth candle.

For an end of week review for EUR/USD on the 30 m time frame we can see it has been a week of high volatility. No surprises here if it hasn't been a very profitable week for EUR scalpers. The most important thing is that we don't get burned with losses through not following the rules. Pay particular attention to spikes against the trend and spikes up towards new highs for signals to go into reverse. Such sharp spikes can be seen on Tuesday and Wednesday when profits were potentially very good. This is all good food for thought and serious contemplation. Follow the strategic rules and stick with the self-discipline to stay out of the market when there is no synchronicity and all will be well. Have great weekend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Monday 17th July. Conflicting signals from the 7 am candles where they indicate to go short against a rising trend on EUR/USD and EUR/NZD. JPY is just channeling sideways along that daily pivot. With no synchronicity this is not a good set up for scalping today. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GM! Thanks for the confirmation , yea the market is not very generous lately. Testing a man's nerves and patience. Wish you a nice week!

Can I just clear something up on pair synchronisation, Are we saying that all four pairs when the Euro is strong Are all synchronise together, So if one is going in the opposite direction to the other 3 we have not got synchronisation, The reason I'm asking this is your 7 o'clock candle on the 15 minute chart. 3 of the pairs are RED and the other one is the GREEN, I was just wondering whether we could just trade two pairs EUR/USD and EUR/JPY as two synchronise pairs, Or do we need all four pairs to confirm the synchronisation, So all four pairs are GREEN equals buy EUR All four pairs are RED equals sell EUR, We do not enter the market if two are red and two are green. PS, keep the good work up. I look forward to your explanation every morning, thank you,

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Synchronisation between all four pairs is almost guaranteed that they will all move in the same direction. If two are one way and two are the other it means that there is indecision for the EUR and whichever way they move is likely to falter. Check back through the charts and see if you can find an example of where two pairs went one way and two went the other with good scalps and let me know if you find one. We will all be interested if there is one. Thanks for the question.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Just wondered if EURCAD is also in the equation?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
It can be if it fits. Often USD, JPY and CAD are in sync when AUD and NZD are not. Does this make sense?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Tuesday 18th July and a bit of a messy picture this morning. Very strong AUD and NZD pushing EUR down, but EUR/USD and EUR/JPY losing their synchronicity. The 7 am candles are projected from the 30 m time frame and do carry weight for NZD and AUD, so traders who followed the direction of the 7 am candle would have scored nicely on those pairs, but lost on JPY with an agonizing wait for USD. I'll give this morning two gains, a loss and an early exit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I think these four chart proves synchronisation, EUR/NZD Was synchronised with EUR/AUD, eur/nzd went 18 days in a bearish direction and only 4 day in a bullish direction, eur/aud went 14days in a bearish direction and only 3 day in a bullish direction, EUR/USD Was synchronised with EUR/JPY, eur/usd went 15 days in a bearish direction and only 5 day in a bullish direction eur/jpy 11 days in a bearish direction and only 3 day in a bullish direction and in the second half of the charts. They ALL went in the same direction, win ratios to the days which are not synchronised is pretty good, in fact if you could predict the trend and stay in the trade for longer periods over a couple of days, you could still come out with a big win, I took these charts from the 29th May right up to yesterday, there was no need to count the Second-period I could quite clearly see, they were all going in the same direction, if you look at today's daily candle there is only the EUR/AUD which is not synchronised, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Wednesday 19th July and a very weak EUR across the board with AUD and NZD at the top of the currency strength leader board. In such circumstances all we need do is respond in the right direction to a pullback against the trend. The first to pullback was EUR/JPY at 6:30 followed by EUR/USD at 7. EUR/AUD pulled back a bit later at 7:30, but EUR/NZD plunged straight through the down side without any pullback at all. A bit of a mixed bag today with non-synchronized pullbacks, despite there being synchronicity in the direction and currency strengths. Focus on the validity of the 7 am candle as an indicator of direction seems to be shifting. Let us focus our attention more on the timing of spiked pullbacks as in this example. It could be more profitable as market dynamics change. I'll score today with Attached Image (click to enlarge)

maybe this method should be called, "I'm staying out of the market today"

--- 帖子 #274 ---
You probably have a good reason why the arrows you have marked are all different time candles on the 15 minute charts. I see EUR/USD 7.00 EUR/JPY 6.30 EUR/AUD 7.30 EUR.NZD 6.00 so everyone can follow the system, we need rules. If we are saying to get our indication to trade is all different time candles, I see this as a bit of hit or miss, can we not wait till all are synchronised, Anything can happen between 6 o'clock and 7.30 it's a long time when you are planning to scalp, plus we must have a defining rule went to stay out of the market, I personally have been trading at 8:05 in the morning. I've been using my currency strength meter my over sold and over bought indicator, If the US and Japanese are below the euro in the strength meter, I've also watching what happens For the first five minutes of the London open with this information. If both candles are Green I buy euro, I stay in the trade from no more than 30 minutes, for a sell everything is reversed,

Hi Redfan. The rules are already written on page one. This thread is in the trading system section... The Thread introducer just tweaks a bit twith the rules and so it looks more like a trading journal.(sry tellboy.. really a golden first page .. ) I´m observing this system for around 6 weeks, day by day and my personal meaning is : It´s a wonderful system, very reliable as long as we follow 100% the rules. I don t see many valid entries, but the rare entries play out.. Stay tuned Guido

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I have read all the rules, There are three essential criteria that need to be synchronised for the best possible outcome. They are: EUR is strong against all other currencies for long trades. (Weakest for short trades). All chosen EUR pairs are trending in the same direction. The 7 am candle for each selected pair on a 5, 10 or 15 M time frame are all pointing in the same direction (up for longs and down for shorts). Everything else that is written is immaterial because rule 3 as already told you to go long short, there is no mention of checking the 6 o'clock candle the 6.30 candle, the only time 6,30 is mentioned is to check the currency strength there is only one important note and that is Note 1 If price has reached a new high or a sigificant resistance level there is a very high probability that price will retrace. Watch the 7 am candle for the signal to go short. What I am questioning is why the arrows have been marked are all different time candles on the 15 minute charts. I see EUR/USD 7.00 EUR/JPY 6.30 EUR/AUD 7.30 EUR.NZD 6.00????? Also, we are supposed to be scalping, how does checking the 6 o'clock candle help us make a trade at 7 o'clock,

--- 帖子 #277 ---
You are right, and the rules are clearly stated on the first page. When synchronicity is present with (a) the strength of the pair, (b) shape of the major trend, and (c) the 7a am candles all in the same direction then we can be assured of the best result possible. However, these are ideal conditions and do not occur every day. If they did then we would all be millionaires. The reality of the markets is that conditions do vary, and each day we can see how varied they are and to what extent how productive they are. It is hoped that followers of this system will learn when to stay out of the market and when to take positions that are profitable. Thanks for the discussion its all valid.

Thursday 20th July and yet another day with no synchronicity. First glance as the currency strength list at 6 am showed EUR pairs scattered up and down the table. This first indicator is a message to go back to bed. But I shall begin to give our indicators a thumbs-up or down as they emerge each day. So, for our list of indicators for today: (1) Are all EUR pairs clustered together at the top or bottom of the currency strength table? = (2) Is there uniformity in the shape and direction of the major trend on a 30 m time frame? = EUR/USD trending down, EUR/JPY trending up, EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD both touched a bottom and crossing the 50 ma to go long. (3) Are all 7 am candles on the 15 m time frame pointing in the same direction? = , but with the main trend on all pairs = Trading these signals would have realized no more than 10 pips for EUR/USD and nothing but losses for all other pairs. Final score for today = The lesson for today is 'Follow the rules, and if the criteria are negative stay out'. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Friday 21st July. This was the situation at 6 am with a strong NZD a weak AUD and a weak JPY. Our first criterion for a possible scalp was nullified, probably by the huge rally on the EUR yesterday by something someone said at the EUR press conference when EUR moved up against the USD by 150 pips. It is therefore highly unlikely that EUR/USD will go anywhere today, but trundle along on a sideways channel. Here are the values for today's indicators as they emerge: (1) EUR strength (2) Synchronicity between pairs (3) 7 am candle direction in sync . I substituted CAD instead of NZD because is was synchronized with USD and JPY. The up move began to be indicated on all pairs at 6:45. Applying the rules of entry by placing a buy stop above the 7 am candles gave entry to all pairs with a reasonable scalp before 8 am with JPY and AUD reaching their 25 pip targets. See the lower chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GM Tellboy, yea not a good week, luckily there will be more to come, enjoy the weekend!!!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Here is the end of week 30 m chart for EUR/USD, showing how useful (or otherwise) is the 7 am candle as a direction indicator. When the pairs is in a tight channel it is not very good, as can be seen here on this chart, but it worked fine, contrary to expectation on Friday after the huge rally. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is fair to say that this strategy works fine when market dynamics are in favour of the EUR, either bearish or bullish, but when EUR is meandering along in a tight channel it isn't much good at all. So, we need an alternative strategy to use when EUR is not in our favour. I am therefore creating a new trading system thread that uses the currency strength table as our first indicator to allow us to choose which currency to trade, using the same strategy, i.e. A basket of synchronised currency pairs and a 7 am candle. I shall call it Basket Trading the European Open.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Monday 24th July and this morning's currency strength table showed EUR scattered all over the place, with all NZD pairs clustered at the bottom, but the weakening EUR changed all that as it came to dominate the bottom of the table. We can see that the 7 am candles were true to form and indicated a strong move to the downside for all pairs. This weakness in the EUR challenged the weakness in the NZD, and EUR forced its way into the bottom of the currency strength table. When we look at our strategic rules, let's see how well they worked for us. (1) EUR pairs clustered together at the top or bottom of the currency strength table? = (2) Are all pairs showing synchronicity in the shape and direction of their trends? = (3) Are all the 7 am candles pointing in the same direction? = and are they all pointing in the direction of the main trend on all pairs? = All 7 am candles agreed on going against the main trend, so traders who followed the increasing momentum of the weakened EUR would have scored ok. So, the question is, do we ignore the first criterion and only follow the 7 am candle? Conflicting outcome today with one of the strategic rules failing, but a good result if we followed the 7 am candles.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Sorry I am little confused at the times of the candles. I live in Europe so I'm at 8 am on Frankfurt market open and 9 am on UK market open. Is your 7 am candle the Frankfurt open candle? or the London open candle?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
My 7 am candle is for UK time, that is GMT+1 at the moment. Does this help?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Yes perfect. That's the Frankfurt open. My charts are set at UK time +2 so my brains are scrambles with all the different time zones lol I had a go at this yesterday just on the Euro and it worked out perfectly. I've noticed that if during the Asian session the currency moves up or down with in the zone and stays in a tight range before the open it often goes in that direction. So if it comes in then settles in the upper part of the Asian zone it breaks to the up side and vice versa.

Tuesday 25th July and there was no agreement on which currency was strongest or weakest on the pairs strength list, and no synchronicity at all on EUR pairs. Here's our check list: 1. All EUR pairs grouped together at the top of bottom of the pairs strength table = 2. All pairs trending in the same direction = 3. 7 am candle all pointing in the same direction = All indicators suggest staying away from the market this morning.

Wednesday 26th July. This is the picture for the EUR pairs at 6 am (GMT+1). (1) EUR pairs group together at top or bottom of strength table? = (2) All pairs synchronised with the same shape and moving in the same direction? = (3) 7 am candles all pointing in the same direction? = USD and CAD in sync, but JPY against the trend and AUD in the opposite direction. This creates a dilution of the momentum of the signaled down move. The outcome is shown in the lower charts where the spike on EUR/USD and EUR/CAD indicate nervousness and early profit taking. If a maximum potential is 100 pips and will show four of these symbols ( ). I'll give today's outcome just one Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thursday 27th July. This was the scenario at 6 am after the huge bull spike created by the US statement last night. Such hikes in price are usually followed with a retracement. But will the USD continue to weaken today? AUD and NZD are strong against all other currencies and could either continue their bullish move or if the EUR continues to gain strength they could reverse at their respective support lines. (1) EUR pairs are weakest at the bottom of the table with the exception of EUR/USD (2) Are all EUR pairs synchronised. No. EUR/USD and EUR/JPY are trending up with EUR/AUD and EUR/NZD down trending. = indecision. (3) Are all 7 am candles pointing in the same direction - let's wait and see??? The lower chart shows all four 7 am candles in indecision mode Any attempt to trade against these indicators would be doomed to failure. . This is the importance of synchronicity with the major trend and all 7 am candles in agreement. See the lower chart for an illustration of market indecision.

Friday 28th July saw conflicting 7 am candles with USD and CAD indicating a continuation of the rising trend but AUD and NZD suggesting a down move against the rising trend. All indicate a lack of synchronicity with the EUR this morning. Any stops triggered would not have produced any significant profit, but those who took the risk may have scored from the sudden 8 am spike on USD and NZD. Best to keep out on day like this. It was too risky with the conflicting 7 am candles. Don't get too disheartened. When circumstances are right (and they haven't been for some time) then profits are good. We just have to be patient.

Good morning.. Agreed, wonderful similarity of the instruments.. But the 7 am candles are all red( EU, EJ and EN).. I skipped for this reason.. stay tuned Guido

This is an example of the 7 am candle giving a false indication and when the pattern is the best indicator. Using a buy stop catches the move unless the 7 am candle is correct and then we are kept out.

How much time would you give the market to "take" the pending order or to delete? 1-2 candles? more??

--- 帖子 #301 ---
It depends on which way the market moves. If it moves in your favour you are in and if the market moves down the stop is not touched.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Oh sry, I think you didn t get me. Of course the pending doesn t get touched if the market moves in the opposite direction. How long would you give the market time to delete the pending order. 1-2 candles ?? more?

The market doesn't delete the pending order. You have to do that yourself.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Are you kidding me? Of course I have to delete the order by myself.. But you didn t answer the intire question.. Let me ask the question a third time.. How long would you wait to delete the pending order, because its not longer a " european open " .... One-two candles( in your m15 chart it is 15-30 minutes) or would you give the market even longer? I really hope you got the question. Thank you;-)

Sorry, I misunderstood. It depends on the price action and momentum. If price moves fast in the wrong direction I'll delete it straight away.

Wednesday 6th September. Sorry I havn't been posting recently. Had other things to do. However, this morning showed how the strategy works in practice when we follow the rules. Synchronicity and the 7 am 15 minute candle gave us a buy signal on all four chosen pairs. Momentum was a bit slow on EUR/USD and this was compensated by all other pairs. I was a bit doubtful of reaching the 25 pip target due to lack of momentum (or my lack of patience) so I doubled up and closed all trades with a profit of £108. Not bad for a morning's work.

Don't be dismayed if the EUR pairs are not synchronized as often as we would like. There is an excellent alternative, using exactly the same strategic criteria that can produce a result each and every day, but with a different major currency. This morning (Monday 18th September) it was the turn of a weak JPY to give a good trading basket. Check out that thread to see how effective the strategy can be with different currency baskets. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post10262604 Happy trading folks.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi Tellboy, I am new to this thread. Please, I would appreciate your comment on 26th October results. I wouldn´t have traded EURUSD because of significant high (maybe watching for reversal), EURJPY would have been loss even if I had switched to 5 min tf and set and moved buy stop orders (it made 20 pips at most). EURAUD would have finished in profit if I had used 5 min tf and buy stop orders. EURNZD would have been loss because trade would have been triggered at 8:15 and that pullback would have taken me out. Is that right? When you use stop orders, how far below/above a candle high/low do you set it? I also looked at 27th October and it looked promissing. EURUSD-pt, EURJPY-pt, EURAUD-pt, EURNZD-loss (probably). Thanks for your opinion.

Sat 25th Nov. End of week review for EUR/USD. Apologies for being out of touch for a while. I have recently returned to UK from Crete and moving into new accommodation, so have been a bit preoccupied with domestic issues. I find it useful to review a week's activity on the EUR/USD pair, so here it is for the past week. The most important question to be addressed is, 'what value does the 7 am candle have on the 30 m chart?' Is it really the 'truth' candle? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Friday 1st December. Here is the end of week review for EUR/USD. It would appear that the dynamics of the pair are changing in a way that invalidates the strategy. It now seems that the 7 am candle is losing its 'truth' bar indicator of direction to trade. Instead it is emerging that the profitable entry point is at 07:30 in the opposite direction of the 7 am candle. Look at the chart below for examples. Don't forget that synchronicity with three other EUR pairs is still essential. Have a good weekend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Friday 8th December sees EUR/USD on a continued bear move throughout the week. Maintaining the strategy of using synchronicity between a set of four pairs, with the 7 am candle as an indicator and EUR/USD as the principle guide we can see that 7:30 has emerged as the right time to enter. See the chart below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Like it, timing wise it suits a Kiwi down under

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi tellboy Your time based strategy is a very good one. It is consistent which is what one is most definitely looking for in this extremely tough game! I have adapted my trading style to it completely now. It works just as well on GBP pairs too. Just wondered, are you talking about 7.00am UK time? I've noticed that often moves are starting last hour of Asian session. That would be 6.00am UK time. I would really say though that if one waits till 7.00am (UK time) it is sometimes the 7.00am bar and sometimes the 7.30am bar (30 min chart)

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Yes, 7 am is UK time. And you are correct when you say that moves often begin in the last hour of the Asian session. First and foremost there must be synchronicity in four pairs in their shape and trend. Then I pay particular attention to the direction of the 06:45 candle on the 15 minute chart. Again, if there is synchronicity on all four pairs then the 7 am bar will usually follow through if it is in the same direction as the trend. I often catch the 7 am bar on all four pairs and call it a day with a good profit instead of waiting for the pullback and then entering at 07:30. In fact, for those of you who want to really test this strategy, you may like to try catching the 7 am move and exit with profits, and then take a second bite of the cherry with the 7:30 follow through with a longer wait and a bigger profit. It is important to point out that when there is a sharp retracement at 7 am against the trend then it is wise to enter at 7:30. See last week's (Dec 1st) end of week chart for excellent examples. It is all a matter of patience, trial and error and testing the strategy to see what works best for you. But remember, if there is no uniformity or synchronicity in the shape and direction of the trend on all four pairs then it won't work. Happy trading to all. Have a good weekend and a good trading week next week.

hi tellyboy your thread sparked my interest. but your rules seem to change all the time. has the dynamic of this method changed, or is it still profitable ? you mention in your last post, that you enter trades at 7am london time (?). on igindex (i have an igindex account too). but you look at the 6.45am candle to determine the direction to trade. that is a 15m candle. but i thought you look at the 30m candle as the truth candle, which i assume is the 6.30am candle. so why now 15m candle ? if you enter at 7am in the direction of the strength, and there is a sharp retracement meaning you are in a loss, would you then enter again at 7.30am in the same direction or in the direction of the retracement ? you said you set your tp at 100 pips but surely you cannot have reached that by 7.30am on all 4 pairs ? also, which 4 pairs to trade and how do you identify synchronity in all 4 pairs. if you can clarify what exactly the rules are, step by step, that would be great, hope you respond, it will be interesting to try out your strategy with the precise rules. lastly, you have other threads, are they all showing the same trading method ?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hey, TB - still trading or have you disappeared into the clouds of Mount Athos !? Anywhichway, I am reviewing your method as it sits very close to one of mine (an M15 chart being very slooooow for me... &amp; I'm slowin' down, just like old Slowhand himself, Eric Clapton ).

Hi Guys. Sorry I have been out of touch. I spent last Summer in Crete and had to come back to UK for psychology research projects. All under control now and back in the trading seat. I have designed an automatic trading system to take the decision making out of the process. Using the rules set out in the first post and letting the system run itself. Here is the state of the EUR pairs on Sunday. We can see there has been a sustained downtrend on all pairs for several weeks now as it nears a bottom. So let's take care and look out for a flattening out at the bottom and a possible reversal. Having said that, the auto system I have devised takes the risk out. Here is a reminder of the strategic rules: Price crosses below the 20 MA when the 100 and 50 MAs are trending down. An added precaution it to trade below the daily pivot when shorting. Let's see how well it works with a 25 pip target on all pairs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good morning EUR scalpers. Here are the charts for this morning. Following such a sustained downtrend on all EUR pairs it was no surprise to see a retracement on all EUR pairs with the exception of EUR/NZD which paved the way for the continued downtrend on all pairs. There has been some confusion on the value of the 7 am candle on the 15 M time frame, but I think the example today, marked by the sell signals, shows us the value of this bar even when synchronicity has been compromised by the EUR/NZD being out of sync. But the NZD did show us the way. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Tuesday 29th May and EUR/USD has reached its previous bottom (check this on a day time frame). Following the rules we have reached our 100 pip target today, that is 25 pips for each pair selected. Take note of the length of the bear candles from 7 am. These illustrate the speed and momentum of the move on all four pairs, indicating an extremely weak EUR. The big question now is will EUR/USD break below its previous low or will it bounce up? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Tellboy, Thanks for the good strategy. It has really shown the extremely weaker Euro in the early week. Lets see how it plays in the remaining day of the month.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Wednesday 30th May and EUR pairs touched a new low yesterday, which suggested the possibility of a bit of a retracement this morning. We can see on today's charts below that there was a bull candle at 7:45 on all charts. A move as strong as this (see the length of that candle) against the trend is a pretty good indicator that price will move to the upside from 7 am and give us our 25 pip target on all pairs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Thursday 31st May and EUR continues its retracement from the bottom. This morning's strong bull candle appeared at 6:30 on all four selected pairs. If you were up early you may have caught it and called it a day. There was a little inconsistency with pull-backs on the AUD and especially NZD which, for those who entered too early, was very scary. Price pushed through nicely from 8 o'clock for EUR/USD and EUR/JPY (see how these pairs are synchronized). We had to wait until 8:15 for AUD and NZD to cease their pull back and resume the upward move to claim our 25 pip target. This was not ideal for those like me who have no patience, but if you have the time and have nerves of steel then it will pay off. Here is also a very good example of the strategy to set a buy stop order as price pulls back. When the up move resumes then your buy stop is triggered and your in the trade.

Nice thread tellboy! EUR is indeed getting stronger! Just my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #336 ---
hi tellboy glad to see you back ! could you kindly answer my post number 327 above of the 10th feb ? when you have the time. thanks

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi there whatfx. Too many questions. One at a time please. Thank you. Or, better still, you may like to go back to the start of the thread and see the rules. When all criteria are met then trades are excellent, but that doesn't happen every day. Trading is dynamic and if pairs performed exactly the same every day then we would all be millionaires. If you want to take trades that don't meet all the criteria then you need a bit of flexibility and risk. I hope this helps. Take care and thanks for the interest.

Friday 1st June sees USD as the strongest currency this morning and AUD the weakest (See the pairs list on the left of the upper chart). We saw conflicting sentiment with EUR pairs with EUR/USD being pushed down by the strengthening USD and out of sync with EUR/JPY. The weakening Aussie sees EUR/AUD rising to a dangerous resistance level and EUR/NZD straddling its 100 MA. Signs suggest that EUR pairs are consolidating sideways following the recent bounce from the bottom. All these signs suggest indecision and therefore staying out of the market this morning. Remember, for good trades we need uniformity and synchronicity. So, if you wanted to trade this morning were you willing to bet on the direction and take a risk or stay out? Strictly following the rules says stay out. The first set of charts shows this conflict at 7:15 and the lower set shows the outcome at 8 am.

Thanks for the updates Tellboy .

hi tellboy, thanks for your response. my questions are: 1. you mention in your post, that you enter trades at 7am london time (?). on igindex (i have an igindex account too). but you look at the 6.45am candle to determine the direction to trade. that is a 15m candle. but i thought you look at the 30m candle as the truth candle, which i assume is the 6.30am candle. so why now 15m candle ? 2. if you enter trade at 7.00 am in the direction of strength but the trade goes against you , would you then enter trade again at 7.30 am in the original direction of strength or the current reverse direction ? 3. i have an ig index account. how do i bring up the pairs list on like you have done ? do i need to request ig index to switch this on my account ? thanks

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Here is the end of week chart for EUR/USD on a 30 m time frame. Whether you use the 30 m or 15 m time frame for your direction to trade is a matter of personal choice. You have to make your own decisions on the information presented in the format that suits you best. When you have opened a trade it is a mistake to change direction. If there is indecision don't trade. Never change your mind when in a trade except to get out fast and limit your loss. In the IG platform go to the Display tab on the main menu and select Lists. Add the pairs to the list to suit your own choices. Sorry about the big black arrow. I can't get rid of it. It means nothing but it conceals a sell signal. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #342 ---
thanks tellboy ! which pairs do i add to the list on my IG platform ?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
That was at 6.45am GMT and do you mean you placed a buy order for the 8am candle and was that order above a 15min candle before 8am e.g. 7.30am or 745am? So you watch for 1hr before deciding the trade?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
You can see the pairs I choose to list on the charts I have posted. This gives a good comparison between all the major currency pairs, but it is up to you which pairs to choose.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
When there is a very strong move on all pairs against the trend it is a very strong signal to go in the direction of that signal. Then it is up to you how and when to place your trade. You could use a buy stop entry order with a pull back or go for it straight away. It is entirely up to you to make the decision.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I think he is confused with the times? The 6.45am candle (15 min chart) is 6.45am UK time, right? so the very next candle (7.00am UK time) which was coincidently the opening of the Frankfurt session was/is ideal to open a trade once it had tested support/resistance which it usually always does. It's a very nice liitle strategy tellboy and it's standing up to the test of time which usually makes or breaks any strategy! Well done

--- 帖子 #347 ---
It is he 6.45am candle (see its been changed incorrectly to 7.45am) but anyway...Ill take it that any pull back after that and if all else lines up would be a place to enter.

Monday 4th June. Here are the charts at 06:30 this morning showing serious inconsistencies in the trends. EUR/USD and EUR/JPY are synchronized in a bullish move, whilst Aussie is very strong against EUR. NZD straddles its 100 MA. So, this is a scenario that suggests staying out of the market because none of our strategic rules are met. Let's see what unfolds.The lower chart was snatched at 07:43 showing the outcome. We can clearly see the value of the 07:00 candle on the 15 M charts where the direction of the move is indicated for all four pairs. Perfect for scalping.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
1. the arrows on your second charts. is that indicating the 7am candle ? 2. the first charts are showing the trend on the four pairs. but you are using the 15min time frame to check the trend. i thought you are meant to use the 30 min timeframe when checking the trend ? 3. as there is indecision in the trends of the 4 pairs, will you then not look at the 7.45 candle as the 'truth candle' to tell us the direction of the trend ? 4. your lower charts were snatched at 07.43. is that london time, or the time shown on your ig index platform ? 5. lastly, again you are using the 15 min TF to check the truth candle, but i thought it should be the 5 min TF ? thanks

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Excellent system for scaling Tellboy. I had tried before, making a box, and where the candle came out, pointing to the dam there. With these indications provided, gives a better view where the dam runs. Today, June 4 in M5, the pair AUD set a great strength, which showed in the emas that never crossed, and indeed the price at the start of the day in Frankfurt, went long. I will be attentive to your comments, and good hunting for all.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
The AUD was strong at the start of Frankfurt and took the USD and JPY up as shown by the correlation in the charts. Good contribution Tellboy

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Last night I looked at the EURAUD chart and thought my goodness this pair is going down, down, down! A nice sell trade even at 7.00am but in terms of the rules here it was not very in sync with the other euro pairs BTW if you use renko then you don't need to worry whether it's 15 min, 30 min or whatever chart!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Yes whatfx, those arrows show the direction of the 7 am candle and the time is the same on my machine as the actual time in London. Why would they be different? I use the 15 M time frame as the most practical for me, but at the end of the week I check the 30 M time frame to fit a whole week into the review. The 30 M time frame is ok for the trend, but not for pinpointing the direction of a move or an entry point. This all comes with experience, so I suggest you use paper trade to get the picture before you risk any real cash. You need to know what you are doing. I hope this helps. Take care.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
perhaps i did not make myself clear. what i meant was, in your first charts, you are looking at the trend on the 4 pairs ? the overnight trend ? and you are using the 15 min timeframe to check the trend. but in your previous posts you stated to use the 30 min chart to check the OVERNIGHT trend ? and aslo to use the 5 min TF to pinpoint the entry, instead of the 15 min TF like you have done. so which one is more accurate for the entry the 5 min or the 15 min TF ? or is it a matter of personal choice. looks like the bullish spike on eurusd this morning did not occur until well after 8am. i had opened a buy swing trade on the eurusd at level 11683. will leave it open and see how it pans out. thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #356 ---
also, where there is indecision in the synchronity of the pairs and the overall trend, do you not use the 7.45 candle as the 'trurh candlle' ?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Tuesday 5th June at 06:30 sees no synchronicity between EUR/USD and EUR/JPY. Markets are dominated by a strong USD and a weak AUD. These are indications to stay out of the market, but for risk takers let's see what the 7 am candle tells us. The lower charts show the outcome. See the reason to stay out of the market when there is a lack of synchronicity. This results in indecision and no clear direction. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I use the 7 am candle on a 15 m chart as my truth candle only if the direction and momentum are the same on all four charts. If there is indecision this is a message to keep out of the market and to not trade. That is how I use it. How you use it is up to you. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi tellboy Yes it will be nice when the EURJPY recovery is over! Perhaps by tomorrow

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Weds 6th June (D Day). EUR/USD is moving in sync with EUR/JPY, and the Aussie is synchronised with the Kiwi, but these two sets of pairs are polarized with each other. So, the trend for the left-side pairs is up and the trend for the right-side pairs is down. There is no synchronicity on all four pairs, so it will be interesting to see what the 07:00 candle says. Happy trading to all. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Below is the result of the 7 am bullish sentiment on all four pairs: It is also interesting to compare this move with what happened only two days ago on Monday where the 7 am candle went bearish. For me this illustrates the value of the 7 am bar on the 15 M chart when market sentiment can go either way. What is most important is that the direction of this candle is uniform on all pairs.

If everything is right, what pair do you normally trade?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Sorry, but basic question about which MAs you're using. I belive you've mentioned 50SMA and 100SMA. What is the 3rd?

I use three MAs, 100, 50 and 20.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
All of them.

Today June 7 to be synchronized the four pairs?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I left with these three pairs long. the fourth handles a very high spread.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Target of 20 pips for each pair reached, except E-usd that only achieved 16 pips.

Well done! What about using EURCAD as the 4th pair?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
This pair in my broker, handles a spread of 12 points, which I think is too high to do scalping

Change your broker.

Thurs 7th June. This is a near-perfect set of trades with uniformity across my chosen currency pairs. The slight flaw with a bearish 7 am candle was a bit scary, but it left a good lower wick and turned out to be a pull-back rather than a retracement. All pairs performed well with the exception of the Kiwi, but Aussie compensated well. All in all, not a bad mornings trading with the strategy working rather well. Have a good day y'all.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Good advice mr. Tellboy. Your comments before 7 o'clock in London every day are well received. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Dear Tellboy and others, thank you for that grate threat. I really like it. I have one question: Does anybody has a little longtime experience with that strategy? Or even a trade statistic or something like that? It would be interessting how the people are doing with the strategy. How long do you, Tellboy, trade this system? Are you profitable over time? Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Why not just backtest? Not difficult to do!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thats true :-) And that is of cause what I will do. But paper trading and real traiding is always different. Thats why I asked. Even when on paper a strategy would be profitable, sometimes its hard to archive because of different circumstances. That is why I asked.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
i see you folks made some pips on longs this morning. but according to me, since the 7am candle were bearish on all 4 pairs, the conditions for entering longs were not fulfilled. the truth candle conflicted against the trend direction. so was it not better to stay out ? especially when truth candle was a significantly strong bearish candle not just on one pair but all 4 pairs. question to tellboy: on ig index, on a 15 min chart, if you want to check the 7.45 candle, a bit of a confusion as the 7.30 candle will finish at 7.45, and the 7.45 candle finishes at 8.00 am. so if you want to check the 7,45 candle, which candle do you look at the 7.30 or 7.45. as with the 7.45 candle you will need to wait for it to finish at 8am, before checking ? or do you look at the 7.30 candle, which finishes at 7.45 to see what the situation is at 7.45 i.e. bullish or bearish ?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Too many questions. I am conferencing on psychology this weekend, so have to keep it brief and don't have the time to answer these questions. Instinct comes into play with practice. Its called 'flying by the seat of your pants' if you don't mind taking the risk, but following the rules strictly to the letter means that when the 7 am candle (which closes at 07:15) is pointing in the opposite direction to the trend on all four pairs we should stay out.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Friday 8th June at 06:45 this is the situation: This pattern suggests that price will channel sideways, but let's see what the 7 am candle says. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Well! I didn't anticipate this outcome: Strong bear on the left two pairs, bullish on the Aussie pair and the Kiwi breaking its daily pivot before bouncing back. Inconsistency is an understatement, but, when we have such a strong momentum on a synchronized pair I have a strong tendency to go with it. Orthodox teaching says 'don't try to catch a falling knife', but when the move is as strong as this on the 7 am candle, it is interesting to note that it will 'always' reach its next significant support level, as if the support level draws price like a magnet. You can bet on it, and this morning I did. Have a good weekend all. (Two shamrocks means successful trades on two pairs). Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm off to a conference on mental health. Take care all.

A bit naughty to break the rules and tell us afterwards! Anyway well done on another sucessful trade. Yes EJ and EU were really bearish in the morning session

Monday 11th June at 06:40 and looking bullish. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is the outcome at 08:09: Attached Image (click to enlarge) For me. the trick is to catch the 07:00 candle with a buy stop order above the pull-back. This strategy works well when the 7 am move is strong and there is no pull-back after the move.

Did you go long EU and EJ?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Today Monday, take these two, the AUD, was measuring its forces to the EUR, and closed well, did not reach the target, but I took 30 pips between the two pairs.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I went long on all four pairs, but only EUR/JPY reached its target and I closed all others when EUR/USD reached its line of resistance.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
todays trades on all 4 pairs would have been a loser before the 20 pips target on each one was reached. not sure how you folks could have made pips.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
There is no worse blind than the one who does not want to see. My strategy with this method is to enter the candle at 7am London time, once it breaks support or immediate resistance.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I think you may be incorrect. The strategy (as I see it) is that no matter what the charts are telling you, one has to wait until 7.00am (UK time). This of course is Frankfurt open. Ideally the price will take off straight away IF there has been some retracement in the hour or so beforehand and one can then open a trade immediately (option 1) If not then one should wait to see if price finds a nice support/resistance area (could be horizontal or diagonal ema line) in the period between 7.00am and 8.00am. One can then perhaps open a trade at that support/resistance area (option 2). Looking at the charts from this morning, 15 min for EURJPY and 30 min for EURUSD (below) "X" marks the spot. I hope tellboy agrees with my brief synopsis of his strategy!

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Tues 12th June at 06:30 (GMT) looking bearish, but EUR/USD and EUR/JPY have fallen out of sync. This suggests that there will be indecision in the market and it will therefore be wise to stay out of the market unless there is a strong synchronised move on all pairs in one direction. The 7 am candle will show us. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Inconsistency with a bearish candle on USD and a bullish candle on NZD showed the indecision in the market, until 08:00 when the market decided to go long on all pairs. Retracements on the Aussie and Kiwi were pretty reliable indicators for a long move. What this shows us is to stay out of the market until there is synchronicity between all pairs when the market decides to move. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Today Tuesday, I see an uncertain panorama, the eur is competing its forces against the usd, and there is no synchronization with the other pairs like the jpy. I stay outside.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Well I did open a small short on EU just after session open. Looking for 1.1750 brought up my SL to BE so no loss if it doesn't work out Unfortunately missed the best entry point which was just before 7.00am EDIT Well it was bullish after 8.00am (UK time) so I got stopped out of course

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The real value of this strategy is that it works very well when all the criteria are met. This teaches is that to trade against the strategic rules is a very risky business and sometimes you will be lucky but most times you will not.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Weds 13th June. Not a pretty picture with no synchronicity between pairs. EUR is bullish against the JPY and the Aussie, but bearish against the USD and NZD. Indecision in the market suggests staying out unless you can crab a few pips with a strong 7 am move on any pair. That's a bit risky. Attached Image (click to enlarge) At 08:15 and the market just can not make up its mind. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Almost a repeat of yesterday! But you are quite right

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Thurs 14th June. At 06:45 all looks bullish with the possible exception of EUR/JPY. This was due to a strengthening Yen. USD was also holding strength. Aussie was weak with a Kiwi showing a little strength. All in all an indication towards long positions on all pairs with the possible exception of EUR/JPY. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the outcome charts below, the strategy reached its 25 pip target with the Aussie and Kiwi, but failed with EUR/USD. A trade with the JPY was seen as a bit risky, so, today's trades gave two out of four for reaching targets. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Friday 15th June at 06:30 after the EUR took a dive from yesterday's double whammy news items. Is the EUR set to continue its earlier decline? Attached Image (click to enlarge) The market couldn't decide whether to continue the decline or to retrace, so it went sideways. The bull candles at 7 am for Aussie and Kiwi told us to stay out because they broke the criteria for the strategy. For those who do follow the rules this meant staying safe. The risk-takers had to wait for price action to synchronise at 08:00 for a downward spike, but this was not sufficient to meet its target on any of the four pairs. So, no shamrocks today. Have a good weekend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Thanks tellboy, you too. It is an excellent system in my view because the mistake that small traders make is that they will spend the whole day constantly searching for a good setup. Yesterday was an exception - but how many days come along like yesterday - they are few and far between!! Looking at when to trade rather then looking at when not to trade is fundamental. Filtering out bad trades is infinitely more important then trying to find good ones! It's a subtle difference. It's mental strategy, right? - how many of us spend time studying mental strategy before we start even opening the charts? Very few I think. Once one starts looking at the charts it requires extreme discipline and mental strength to be successful. So very strict rules are vital. Of course a strategy that is +80% at filtering out bad trades is worth it's weight in gold IMHO. Well done on finding one.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Monday 18th June. The conditions around the EUR pairs are decidedly bearish with strength in the Aussie and Kiwi in particular where they are grouped together in the upper quadrant of the strength table on the left of the first set of charts below. We are therefore looking to see a bearish candle at 07:00 on all pairs for a signal to go short: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although none of my selected pairs reached their target of 25 pips, it was a good scalp following the bearish 7 am candle on all pairs. Exiting trades at 08:15 when they failed to reach their targets was a good strategy to avoid losing profits gained. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Great first couple of hours again. After that the market manipulators and Stop hunters get to the office and start working in earnest. Usually the end of profitable trading for the day! If RT's only realised that and stuck to the script I think they might see some good profitability. On average (and in this game one must always try to increase the odds in one's favour) this time of the trading day produces the best results. Time and time again. I went with GJ - missed GU but 40 pips rake off - not too bad! Using the same principles on the GBP pairs. I went with GBP pairs because GBP was weakest currency earlier. Of course that's turned around now which is the typical market manipulation tactics.

Hi tellboy Would you mind possibly telling me what was the low on your platform for EURJPY on 5th June? On mine ( Tickmill ) it is 127.792 The reason is that I had a TP at 127.803 which wasn't triggered - just interested to see if maybe something was manipulated - pretty sure it was actually. The spread is always around .8 pip so I'm not sure what happened, Thanks

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Tues 19th June at 06:40 the JPY is right out of sync with the rest so I have substituted it with CAD. Now all EUR pairs are grouped together at the top of the table with a distinctly bullish direction of travel for all pairs. This provides us with our top two indicators. Now, if the 7 am candle moves in sync in the same direction all all pairs then we have our third signal to go long. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Discrepancy showed itself this morning with signals to go short on EUR/USD and EUR/CAD which went against the trend. Those of us who follow the rules to the letter will have put a buy stop above the pullbacks, the result being a successful trade on the Kiwi that reached its 25 pip target. Aussie caught us out with catching the buy stop order and then going south with USD and CAD. So, what have we learned this morning? Where there is conflict in the 7 am candle as it goes against the trend - stay out or put a buy stop order above the pull back. This will keep you safe. Risk takers will go with the short signals. However, if the 7 am candle points in the same direction as the trend then all pairs will show a good trade. This lower chart shows the outcome at just before 08:00: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is the daily chart for EUR/USD at 10:20 on Tuesday 19th June 2018 showing how the pair are in a serious bear move towards the previous low support level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #405 ---
What's going to happen today? All EUR pairs are clustered in the lower quartile of the rank table suggest a continuation of the bear move initiated last Thursday, but inconsistency between USD and CAD suggest indecision with the market dominated with a strong AUD. These suggest being very cautious. The 7 am candle was inconsistent which further indicated indecision and staying out of the market. The lower chart shows the outcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Observers will notice that CAD was changed back to JPY on the lower set of charts. This helps to illustrate the sideways channeling of the market with JPY as the guide. This strategy works best when the EUR/JPY is trending up or down, but is not a lot of use when channeling sideways as it is at the moment. What we are waiting for is a synchronised breakout from the sideways channel - either up or down into a new trend. Then we can make some serious pips again. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Thursday 21st June at 06:35 sees JPY and USD out of sync with a strong USD. The EUR pairs (colored blue) are scattered through the strength table to the left of the charts, indicating lack of synchronicity, so our first two criteria for trading are missing. This strongly suggests that the market will be undecided and maintain its sideways channel. Let's see what happens at 7 am? Attached Image (click to enlarge) See what I mean? Sideways channeling at 08:40. Did anyone take a risk and win? The strategic rules say when there is no synchronicity - stay out and stay safe. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Friday 22nd June at 06:00 this is what the market looks like for four EUR pairs. EUR/USD and EUR/JPY are synchronised in a bullish direction whilst the Aussie and Kiwi are in a downtrend. But will they retrace in sync with USD and JPY? Pay particular attention to the horizontal lines that indicate major support and resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sometimes it pays to get up early and place stop orders to catch a move. See the charts below, taken at 07:15 for an example of where the early bird catches the worm. These stop orders were placed at 06:00 and profits taken well before 07:00.

End of week review. It looks like EUR/USD may be recovering from a double bottom on the daily chart, then on the 15 M time frame we can see how price moved well above the 11,600 resistance level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Mon 25th June at 06:37. EUR pairs are scattered up and down the strenth table due to a strong USD and JPY showing EUR in bearish sentiment against a bullish sentiment against the weakness in AUD and NZD. Lack of synchronicity suggests to be cautious and stay out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The outcome at 08:18 shows the conflicting messages at 07:00 for all pairs where there was no synchronicity at all and the EUR market remained undecided until it showed us a synchronized downward spike at 07:55. Risk takers may have caught it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Tuesday 26th June at 06:60. All EUR pairs on the rise in the strength table and all synchronized in favour of a continuation of the up-trend. But.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) ....the 7 am candle gave conflicting messages on three of the four pairs. This suggested indecision in the market and gave us a good indication to stay out. This is the true value of this system. When there is conflict - STAY OUT OR GET BURNED. So, if you ignored the strategic rules today this is what happened . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Weds 27th June at 06:40. No synchronicity - stay out of this market. It is too unpredictable. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The EUR maintains its sideways channel. Keep out of this market until it decides to start trending again. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thurs 28th June at 07:26. Market is dominated by a strong USD and a very weak NZD. There is no synchronicity in the market for the EUR as it touches its previous low. Will it bounce back or follow through? Indecision says keep out unless there is a strong move. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The lower charts show the indecision where EUR/USD and EUR/JPY broke through its previous support but AUD and NZD maintained support. Risk takers may have scored a few pips on the USD and JPY pairs with sell stop orders, but failed to reach targets. Aussie and Kiwi would have made a loss. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Fri 29th June. Does anyone know what caused that spike at 03:30? It was a decision taken by European leaders on immigration. Now, who knows what the market will do this morning when it sees that? I for one will just watch what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Weds 4th July. There has been no synchronicity between EUR pairs for some time now, so I have not been posting for the past couple of days. Below is today's set of charts at 06:36 showing the lack of synchronicity again where it is too risky to try to trade with any degree of success. I shall watch and wait for synchronicity before I start to trade again with this system. Take care all and don't take risks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thursday 5th July. Sometimes it pays to get up early and catch the spike at 06:00. Here is an excellent example of where the spike reached its target at the resistance levels on all four pairs. As I have said in the first post of this thread, the ideal set up with this strategy doesn't happen every day, but when it does bullseye, and today the lesson is, 'get up early' .

Can you share the strength indicators showing the hierarchy of fx pairs on the left side of the chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #417 ---
They are there on the left slightly obscured by the snagit capture button. EUR pairs are all in blue. This is a feature of the IG Index software. I can't share it with you if that's what you wanted. Does this answer your question?

Friday 6th July at 06:00. No synchronicity between Western pairs on the left and Oriental pairs on the right. This will cause indecision, so no trade for me this morning. Have a good day y'all. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

End of week review on Friday 6th July and it looks encouraging to see the possibility of a EUR rally after the sideways channel. Have a good weekend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Ok.....I have to figure out how to obtain it myself. Thanks for the info....

Monday 9th July at 06:15, there is synchronicity between EUR/USD and EUR/JPY for a continuation of the bull move to break out of the sideways channel, but the opposite story for Aussie and the Kiwi. This suggests a lack of synchronicity across all pairs and therefore not an ideal set up for this strategy. However, risk takers my consider placing a buy stop order above the USD and JPY pairs to catch a spike if the bull move continues. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is the result of buy stop orders placed on those two pairs. Each made a profit but failed to reach a 25 pip target, so, we can give today's trades two out of four Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Tues 10th July at 06:00 shows lack of uniformity in the trends of these four EUR pairs. The first two indicators for our strategy are not met today, so following the rules we are advised to stay out of the market. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Similar story today on Weds 11th July. EUR pairs are scattered up and down the strength table and lacking uniformity in their trends. EUR is trending down against USD and JPY and up against Aussie and Kiwi. So according to the strategic rules we steer clear of trading these pairs this morning. Advice for risk-takers - .

Friday 13th July at 06:00. No synchronicity with EUR pairs spread out on the strength table. No trade today . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Tuesday 17th July saw EUR/USD and EUR/JPY in a bullish trend with AUD and NZD in a bearish move following the overnight news from the Aussie bank. Placing buy stop orders above the pullacks triggered long positions on all pairs with the 7 am candle. The end result shows four good trades and how EUR/USD and EUR/NZD reached their 25 pip targets.

Fri 20th July - just for educational purposes, the charts below provide an excellent example of when NOT to trade. None of the strategic rules have been met from the outset, i.e. EUR pairs are scattered throughout the strength table and there is conflict between EUR/USD and EUR/JPY on the two charts to the left with a strong AUD and NZD forcing EUR down on those pairs to the right. When we see EUR move in opposite directions simultaneously on the 7 am candle then that is a sure sign to keep out. For risk takers this morning the result would have been four bad trades .

Tuesday 24th July sees synchronicity between USD and JPY pairs but sideways channel for AUD and NZD. So, momentum indicated on the EUR/USD was exploited by reaching its support. Two good trades EUR/USD and EUR/JPY with EUR/USD reaching its support target . Attached Image (click to enlarge)
