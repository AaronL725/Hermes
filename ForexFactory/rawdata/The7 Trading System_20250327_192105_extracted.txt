Here is a trading system I have been using for the last 6 month with great results. The idea is "cut your losses short and let the winner run" I am trading only the Daily Charts on dailyfx. It is a web based chart which allows mobility. I am only trading daily's but feel free to test it on different timeframes.

Here are the rules: Do not trade only 1 pair. Use your money management and positions wisely and allow room for as many pairs as possible. The point here is that we want the winners to outrun the losers..

Place a 5 EMA High and 5 EMA Low on the chart. Short when red candle closes inside the channel, long when blue candle closes inside the channel. Closing candle has to open outside the channel to become a valid signal. Let it run until you see opposite signal. Stop Loss is high/low from last candle.

Lets start rolling...

No hard rules...Nothing is written in stone. Dont chase perfection in patterns. Demo it for a while and you will get the feel soon..

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Currently I have 8 positions open, all in the green zone. Aud/Usd and Nz/Usd were open yesterday with +90 pips each and counting. Other 6 pairs opened today...

Eur/Jpy buy

Eur/Usd buy

Gbp/Jpy buy

Gbp/Usd buy

Usd/Cad short

Usd/Chf short

--- 帖子 #4 ---
can you explain this part a bit more?......

How many pairs you trade and how many trades you get per day?

What is the average R:R?

Well too many questions for now....Thanks....

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The area between the 2 Ema's is the inside of the channel. If the candle closes in between we have a signal. Depending on the margin you have I usually have 4-5 positions open a day. The channel will avoid most ranging markets...

--- 帖子 #6 ---
looks interesting and simple...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Eur/Gbp has formed a nice pinbar yesterday. Even it didnt close inside my channel I see a good opportunity for long. Posting charts with Mt4 is easier but not so much with dailyfx. So forgive me for my laziness but feel free to post your charts..

--- 帖子 #8 ---
hi the7

a simple trading method, good.

to ensure i got your meaning correct, would one take these trades short (green arrows) and long (orange arrow)?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yeap, you got it right Pama. Keep in my mind that this current chart is one of the worst samples for this system..There are so many other good ones. Just do a visual backtest...You will be surprised with what you see...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Nice and simple. May I know how you came up with this system?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi,

Some questions as attached. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
7  thanks for avery interesting system. Have you tried it with Heiken Ashi candles instead?  HA candles will probably give more consistent signals.

--- 帖子 #13 ---

2many jokers not many traders.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
You really need to make your rules clearer; because they're unclear you're getting so many questions.

Just to say "go long when it's inside and short when it's inside" leaves too many questions.

Can you try again?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
good one  .

i use a similar thing myself as part of one of my own trading systems.

once candle closes inside the channel. do u trade at the opening of next candle  and how many pips buffer before entry ?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Really? It seems fairly simple to me - if you have a candle that opened above/below the "channel" and closed inside, then you have a sell/buy signal, respectively. There are more signals not marked on the first chart, but the idea is clear.

Sincerely,

Barbossa

you use TF?

Place a 5 EMA High and 5 EMA Low on the chart. Short when candle closes inside the channel, same for long. Let it run until you see opposite signal. Stop Loss is high/low from last candle.

Lets start rolling...[/quote]

Gann Hilo indicator set to 5 gives you a better visual representation of when the 5 hi or lo is broken. See attached chart.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Very nice I have to try this system. I think that is makes more profit if we can control base on money management.

Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
okehiedon,

share your template and indicators please

--- 帖子 #23 ---
This is very interesting. It is an extremely simple system, yet it is indeed profitable with some pairs. It returns 10% per year on EUR/USD, 84% on AUD/USD, and 45% on USD/CAD. It loses money with GBP/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/JPY.

If someone wants to automated trade this system, here's the simple code (for Zorro):

Inserted Code function run()
{
// Open a Daily chart
BarPeriod = 1440;

// Place a 5 EMA High and 5 EMA Low on the chart.
var EMA5H = EMA(series(priceHigh()),5);
var EMA5L = EMA(series(priceLow()),5);

// Stop Loss is high/low from last candle.
Stop = priceHigh(1) - priceLow(1);

// Short when candle closes inside the channel
if(priceOpen() > EMA5H && priceClose() < EMA5H && priceClose() > EMA5L)
enterShort();
// same for long. Let it run until you see opposite signal
if(priceOpen() < EMA5L && priceClose() > EMA5L && priceClose() < EMA5H)
enterLong();
}

That's one of the simplest systems I've seen that is profitable without tweaking. I would not really trade it as it is because its Sharpe Ratio is below 1 with all currencies. But it looks as if it could be made much more profitable with some modifications, for instance replacing the EMA with a Lowpass filter.

Here's the equity curve with AUD/USD:

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Sorry if I was not clear enough about the entry rules. But honestly dont know how easier I can explain. If the candle closes inside the channel (5Ema High and 5 Ema Low) I immediately enter the trade. No buffer, no extra rules. (Again, not looking for perfect patterns)

I followed the flying buddha system for some time and came up with this. Solely a 5 EMA close would give to many false signals but thanks pointing this out. The channel is avoiding retracements most of the time...

--- 帖子 #25 ---
If the candle touches both sides of the channel, I like to avoid the entry...

Edit: Second arrow on short is not an entry, due the touch of both channels.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I appreciate the backtesting. Can you try the test with the candle open on GMT0 please?? Thats what I use..

--- 帖子 #27 ---
The candle body must be outside the channel, correct? Not just the wick?

Rob

--- 帖子 #28 ---
As much I like HA candles for my exits, I believe they are delayed  for entries. But please try to keep the system as it is...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Please I am still having difficulty getting all the rules right. Could you show all buys and sells on a single chart?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
"If candle closes inside the channel I enter the trade" With all due respect dont know how else to word, structure and sentence this differently...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
All 3 circles were correct entries. 2 losers and 1 winner.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
First, thank you for sharing a system with everyone. But I am confused too. I understand that you enter when a candle closes inside the channel, but if a candle closes inside the channel, how do you know if you will go long or go short? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
With this system we are trying to catch the trend from the start, with the very first candle. Meaning if the candle that closes inside the channel is red go short, if its blue go long..

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes the candle colour makes the rules clear......

Also refer post# 17.......you think that is right explanation?....

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The7........if someone doesn't understand your explanation he should take a break from forex trading.........I am seriously shocked......how much easier can your expanation be.....YOU ARE SUPER CLEAR...... (except if he is not English....but even then....)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Sorry if this was already covered.. didn't see it though but, when we exit , for example a long position on a red candle closing inside the channel, are we at the same time entering a short?

Also , if we are just going buy a single candle color we will at times trading against a strong trend?

Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I,am not real bright but it,s as clear as a bell to me.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
We all know that sometimes everything works. Any indicator, any system and any pattern..until it doesnt work anymore...I believe the strength in this system is that the trend is catched before it even has formed. So we might get many losing trades but they are usually minimal.(only 1 size of the last candle), but once we catch the wave we should be satisfied with the outcome. The Flying buddha system was a very popular thread many years ago. It was using the 5Ema close for entries. If the candle would close without touching the ema we would enter and add positions further on. This is how I came up with the channel. Ths is a ranging chart. Notice trades dont turn out that bad?? Not sure if any other system would produce the same results..

"The candle has to open outside but close inside the channel without touching both sides." to make the signal valid.

I guess I understand know why some people were confused before. I guess my last sentence should clarify the confusion.

Edit: Last short arrow should be for the next red candle.(Feel free if you want to trade pinbars with this sytem)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Look at the long signal on this chart. I dont care what this trade will turn into. A win or loss: IT IS A %100 BEAUTIFUL LONG ENTRY.(even the long signal did not open outside the channel) Ask any professional trader regardless of what system they use...It is a LONG signal...Simple as that...As long as we do the right thing I guess the market will reward us sooner or later..

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi 7,

Thanks for that explanation...And so when you are closing one position , you are opening another on same currency pair?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Look at the 3 check signs. The candles are not closing inside the channel so we dont have a short signal. (To be honest with you I would still enter with the 3rd check because of the pinbar..love them..yes it would turn to be a loss)

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes, I am always in a trade. Make sure you not using 1 pair though. Diversification is key..Manage your risk..Market is not perfect..

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Gann Hilo indicator set to 5 gives you a better visual representation of when the 5 hi or lo is broken. See attached chart.[/quote]

The only other confirmation I always look is:

Pinbars,

Engulfing bars,

Round number rejections(...00 and ...50)

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thank you for your answer and being professional.  I think many people shy away from asking questions on FF because there always seems to be these jerks hanging around to attack people who ask questions.  Everyone sees things from different angles so there are always going to be questions even if they seem to be "dumb" to some people.  The only dumb question is the one that is not asked.  Thanks again for your patience.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
. Stop Loss is high/low from last candle.

Lets start rolling...[/quote]

hi THE7!Hello THE7! What do you mean " last candle '' for SL? It is an signal candle, which was closed in the channel, or a candle by it previous? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Then you have entries and exits nearly every day, because nearly every candle closes inside the channel. Why is it, do you think, that so many people are having difficulty understanding what you are doing? Is it all of us? Why not clarify? Such as, if candle exits the channel to the downside, when it comes back up and closes inside the channel I go long. Something like that? Anything? Just "if candle closes inside the channel I enter the trade" tells us nothing about direction; which way did the candle enter the channel from? Which way did you trade, long or short?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Oh, ok, now you're adding to the rules. Could you put this on the first post? If so you'll not get so many questions. It just really helps, when writing, to try to be clear so you don't have to answer a ton of questions and add more rules as you go along.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
The test was with GMT0 candles, I use them too.

By the way, your additional condition - only enter a trade when the whole candle does not touch the opposite EMA - reduces the performance a little. Best performance is when only the close does not touch the opposite site.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I think the description was quite clear. Here it is in my script if that helps:

Inserted Code // Short when candle closes inside the channel
if(priceOpen() > EMA5H && priceClose() < EMA5H && priceClose() > EMA5L)
enterShort();
// same for long. Let it run until you see opposite signal
if(priceOpen() < EMA5L && priceClose() > EMA5L && priceClose() < EMA5H)
enterLong();

Enter short when Open is above the channel and Close is inside; enter long when Open is below the channel and Close is inside.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hey everybody - looks interesting - I am currently trading a 10 EMA Day system - however in ranging periods its really hard.

My question:

Do you exit as soon has the price closes out of the 5 EMA (high or low) at the opposite direction of your trade?

So lets say:

You entered short - do you exit the trade as soon as price closes above 5 EMA High?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
No, he exits when he enters in opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thanks for this clarification

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Please have a look at AUDUSD daily chart.

The two entries marked with arrows were failed trades even though they closed inside the channel. Were these valid entries as per your system?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I made some more experiments with modifications of that system and found that the performance is quite good. The following chart is the result of a walk forward analysis with 3 assets and optimized parameters. A a walk forward analysis is very thorough and only really profitable systems pass it.

http://zorro-trader.com/Log/the7_optimized.png

The blue area is the equity. The annual return is 255% with combined strategy with the 3 assets that were profitable, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, USD/CAD. The modifications are that I replaced EMA with a lowpass filter and used the low and high of the 2 last bars for the stop. The optimized parameters are the time period and a factor for the stop. I can post the code here if someone wants to reproduce the result.

Hi:

Please clarify what you mean when you say the candle has to open outside the channel. Note my circling the candles on your chart that do not open outside the channel.

I understand the last one...you love pinbars so take them when they open and close outside the same side of channel but don't understand the other circled candles.

Thanks for helping us.

Steve

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The candle was outside the EMA bands.  Then it entered the EMA band and closed.  We enter at that point.

Hope that helps

DD

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hello Friends,

NZD close inside the ema band on friday.  Good chance to sell short monday open.

See attached chart.

DD

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi,

GBPJPY bearish candle close inside EMA band uesterday.  But not a sell signal as it is coming up from lower EMA.

The candle previous tothat ( Thursday) gave a buy signal by closing inside the bands, coming up from below the ema bands.

Hope I got this correctly.

DD

--- 帖子 #59 ---
The 5 Ema channel gives us a good feel where the market is heading. If we have a long trend followed with a short candle which opens outside but closes inside the channel we close the long trade and enter a short. In my second post I said "No hard rules" . If  I see a pinbar, a engulfing bar with good round number rejections I choose to enter the trade, even it doesnt meet the requirements...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes they were 2 valid trades but failing ones...

--- 帖子 #61 ---
You dont have to enter every single signal. Be creative. Watch other factors like support and resistance levels for confirmation. Watch the wick size if you like.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I have few buddies who like to exit when the price touches the other side of the channel, not me..I always like to ride...It is up to you.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
If this is not beautiful, I dont know what is...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Well, better let it not be up to what you "like". Better use the method that gets you more profit.

Candle may touch  ->  255% annual profit

Candle must not touch  ->  212% annual profit

--- 帖子 #65 ---
hi THE7!Hello THE7! What do you mean " last candle '' for SL? It is an signal candle, which was closed in the channel, or a candle by it previous? Thanks.[/quote]

THE7, thank you a lot for sharing your system. Good work.

Could you clarify the question above. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
In the past. Tweaking the parameters for best performance in the past too much almost ensures worse performance in the future. Make a little experiment - select any system you like and optimize it on a reasonably large period of historical data in order to get the best possible result. Then select another reasonably large period and run a test with the optimized settings. I'd be very surprised if you get the same results.

That said, ever thought that maybe being up to what you like is the method that gets you more profit?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
This is interesting.....  Looking at a weekly using the 5ema H/L looks AMAZING.  Can someone run a backtest on the EA using a weekly chart?  This might have some legs...

--- 帖子 #68 ---
This might work really well in equities also....  Intersted to see the backtest results using the weekly with the same rules.

Hopefully someone better at coding, EA's, etc. then me can figure out how to run that test.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #69 ---
very nicely done

cheers

--- 帖子 #70 ---
That's right, but the results are not "in the past". They are from a walk forward analysis. Otherwise they would be rather meaningless.

The Walk Forward Optimization method I'm using is explained here: http://zorro-trader.com/manual/en/training.htm

--- 帖子 #71 ---
The system loses about 900 pips/year on weekly bars with the 3 tested assets.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Have to agree. I've been running through my charts and nzdusd seems to be one of the best for the system. Ready to go short on this one.

Rob

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yep short it is NU is already very high and the trend is shifting so looks like a nice entry for short!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Early in the trade LONGS - GBPJPY, AUDJPY, CADJPY, EURJPY, EURUSD, EURGBP

Early in the trade SHORTS - GBPCHF, NZDUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD

Might be missing a few but it looks like all of these could be opened today following the rules of the system.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I don't think its a short on UC.  Blue bar...

--- 帖子 #76 ---
And Usd/Cad is the same...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
True, I forgot about the bar rule.

thanks

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Just running through a few pairs and I see a number that have gone upwards of 200 pips in our favour before turning round and hitting full stop loss before opposite signal appears , may be we should be thinking of going to breakeven when up about 100 pips or so, I think I would struggle to get my head round this if I was up that amount only to see it turn into a loss, what do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Very simple and straight-forward system...and, of course, I like it!  If GREEN candle opens outside 5 ema hi-lo channel, and closes inside 5 ema hi-lo channel...GO LONG.  (with both feet if candle is a pin bar, bullish engulfing, etc)  If RED candle, vice-versa (no, that's not Italian)!

Finally, a system I can sink my teeth (upper plate anyways) into!  I'm in!!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Dreamliner it's in the 1st post.  OP is not saying that we just close inside the candle.  The candle must 1st open outside the channel and close inside.  Pretty simple imo.

Todd

--- 帖子 #81 ---
The7 do you move SL to the previous daily bar (low if long, high if short) each day?

thx

--- 帖子 #82 ---
No he doesn't; he gets out when there is an opposite signal. It's in the first post.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yep 1st post "Closing candle has to open outside the channel to become a valid signal.  Let it run until you see opposite signal. Stop Loss is high/low from  last candle".

I would assume if you have a SL then you move that stop loss on a daily basis.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Do you see now why many of us were unclear, as you are now? He did not address moving the stop loss, just as he did not say the candle must open outside the channel then close inside. Many things left unsaid bring up many questions. Now you're asking them along with many of us.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
LOL that's weird.  It says in the 1st post that the closing candle must open outside the channel.  Guess it's just me.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
He changed it due to all the questions.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Cool thx.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Took this AU short.  Just barely closed inside, we'll see where it goes.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
sorry here it is...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
7, do you think there's also a case to be made for a separate trend continuation trade in those instances in a trending market when there may not have been a signal from the original rules but when price exceeds the bands, high or low?  See the example.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
In your examples, I would have been in that downtrend 7 candles earlier than the down arrow is pointing, and in the next uptrend 4 candles earlier. In both cases I would have been in the trend before the breakouts to the outside of the EMA bands, and benefitted from both longer runs.

If you are looking for different entries, then you may be changing the dynamics of the strategy. Do you have an entry method in mind?

Good trading!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
looks like u would have been stopped out on nzdusd short.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
The7,

Many thanks for sharing your system with us.

jcl365,

Have you tested this on lower timeframes?

Lee

--- 帖子 #94 ---
No mate.  The high on Friday candle was 0.8355.  so far today the high has been 0.8318.  I got in a little late at 0.8285.  Stop loss is 0.8365

Looking for 1:1 RR  that means 0.8205.  But will be flexible there.  If I see 50 pips before going to sleep I will take it.

DD

--- 帖子 #95 ---
About continuing with trend earlier, the rules says until the opposite signal or stop loss. So you would have to renter somehow or wait for another opportunity.

Please explain your understanding in this regard. Thanks

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes, but daily candles are the best for this system. I tested 4 hour timeframes which usually generate the most profit with forex, but not this time.

The likely reason is that the system directly uses the close and open prices of a candle. Direct unfiltered prices work on daily bars, but are usually too random for being profitable on intraday bars.

By the way, you can easily test variants yourself. The Zorro platform is free and with the script that I posted here, it's a matter of 2 minutes to test other time frames or different entry conditions.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
My nzdusd short worked out well. Took out my trailing SL, but I

made some pips before it reversed.

My eurjpy long is looking good, also. I'm good for some pips,

now that my TS has been triggered.

I'm liking this system a lot.

Rob

--- 帖子 #98 ---
The 7, What pairs have you had the most success with? Or do you pick any

that has the set-up?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #99 ---
awesome results, could you please post the code so that i could try? thanks.

my impression is eurjpy, audjpy might have great potential using this method.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Just ran my charts and it looks like we have some nice setups on the way.

eurusd, long - touching both channels, but I'll probably go for it, anyway

gbpusd, long - if it closes in the channel, it'll meet the rules

usdchf, short - touching both channels, but could work out

eurjpy, long - touching both channels, but will give it a go

eurnzd, long - good setup

Rob

--- 帖子 #101 ---
as to your code, is the "stoploss" logic correct?  or as i understand (font in red)?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hello folks. I'm glad some of you are enjoying the system. Please keep in mind that there shouldnt be any hard rules to any system. Personally the reason I like the 5 ema channel is because it visually gives us an idea where the market might be heading.  Today I only notice Eur/Nzd as a nice long entry. Most of the rest pairs can't decide the direction. No system will work when this happens. Please be patient..

--- 帖子 #103 ---
When trying lower timeframes paying attention on support/resistance levels become more significant. Always look for a reason to enter.(rejections on pivot points, round numbers etc.)

--- 帖子 #104 ---
well, indeed showing some potential, which is surprisingly unexpected.

however, there is indeed, often, such period (between two vertical red lines shown by attached) that may cause significant drawdown.

the rules might use some finetuning on MM to get better.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
this is my favourite that has solved some of my puzzles.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
my bad... lol sorry for multiple posts

--- 帖子 #109 ---
It's interesting that you noticed this. No, the logic is not correct. I misunderstood the original algorithm: The7 probably meant to use the Low and High for an absolute stop limit, but I used instead the candle High-Low difference for a relative stop distance.

This was a fortunate misunderstanding though, because the distance was more profitable with all tested currencies than the original system. BTW the most profit it generated by using the Low and High of the last 2 candles:

Stop = HH(2) - LL(2);

This makes sense because the High-Low distance is equivalent to the current volatility. It was the stop method in the optimized version with the 255% profit.

Hi okehiedon,so how is your result with the Gan indicator

Gann Hilo indicator set to 5 gives you a better visual representation of when the 5 hi or lo is broken. See attached chart.[/quote]

I'm using Steve Hopwood's MPTM with a TS of 30. I'm looking for enough

momentum to get the first 30 pips. If the momentum is strong enough,

then more pips are in the bank.

Rob

--- 帖子 #115 ---
About 90 pips so far.  Thinking about pulling it at the 38 level, we'll see...

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I think this system has great potential. When I look at my charts, I see trades all over the place. There's always another one waiting around the corner.

The attached statement is only for two days. The one loss was actually a screw-up on my part, but it should be included since no one is perfect.

Rob

--- 帖子 #117 ---
ChicagoRob,

What type of exit are using for those trades?  Are you just grabbing a set amount of pips or are you waiting for opposite signal per the rules?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Right now, I'm going for a set 30 pips and letting MPTM manage the trade from there. I've noticed there's usually enough momentum to get the first 30 banked, before a price reversal. I've also noticed that if there's strong momentum, the TS works very well in grabbing a nice chunk of pips. It's just one way to look at the system. I do play the entries exactly as stated by the author, though.

Rob

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Could you share the MPTM?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi The7,

Thanks for sharing your system.

Appreciate if you could tell us if these qualify as valid entries. (FXDD day ended two hours ago at 17:00 Eastern, -5:00 GMT).

GBPUSD - Buy

NZDUSD - Sell

Silver  -  Sell

Gold - Sell

Thanks

TF

Edit: The above entries have assumed touch of the EMA channel rather than opening outside the channel. I wonder if this is acceptable.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Here you go.

Hi my friend,Thanks the system,just closed 80% of my pos in GN and letting the balance 20% to run with 100 pip SL..

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hello everyone from Houston. I just have one question. On the first page it says  "Closing candle has to open outside the channel to become a valid signal." Does that mean that the body of the candle has to be outside the channel, not just the wick. I keep seeing the wicks outside the channel and the body inside the channel. Doesn't the body of the candle represent the opening and closing of the candle?

Thank you for the clarification.

Darryl

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I made a really quick EA from my understanding of this system ..

A quick back test from 1-1-2011 to 9-2012, on EURUSD 4 hour and EMA set to 10 has some positive result

I haven't tested the code much, so assume there will be bugs!

The only settings I really change are the EMA value (from 5 to 10), and the "slm"  & "tsm" (stop loss multiplier & trailing stop multiplier).

If StopLoss & TrailingStop are 0, and ATR_STOPS are off, then the stoploss and trailing stop are the difference between the high and low of the EMA. The slm & tsm are multiples of this value.

BreakEven sets breakeven in pips (defaults to 0 - off)

CBC is the "closing bar count" (defaults to 0 - off). This means if an order is in profit and price closes above/below the high/low of CBC bars, it will close the order

MultiTrade - if set to true, will allow multiple buy or sell trades

Hedge - if set to true, will allow buy and sell at the same time

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Very simple, and very easy to follow. I have used it on demo for 2 weeks and I am impressed with the results. I use my own money management ideas and I feel that has tightened up the system for me.

One more month and I think this system will go live.

Thanks again mate

--- 帖子 #129 ---
nice,

ultimately, this is a semi-EA, (i mean the original method, not your EA)

try setting TP = 0 without trailing stop, you'll see the potential of this method, try it, if interested.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Darryl,

It looks to me from the examples given on these pages that it is just the wick which is outside the channel, not the open.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi ChicagoRob,

What is your take on the question posed by many, whether the wick should be outside the channel or the open needs to be outside the channel?

TF

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I forgot to mention the lot sizes ... in the back test I left my EA Lot size at 0, which is automatic. It depends on the LotDivisor and account balance.

I used a $10,000 balance for the back test, so lot size started at 0.1

--- 帖子 #133 ---
It is my understanding that the open should be outside the channel and the close inside, not just the wicks, I could be wrong.

For example, I have traded last nights close of the GBPUSD daily candle as a sell signal as a pin bar formed rather than a buy signal as suggested by someone else. This is currently up 20 pips. I am also using MPTM to trail the stop by 30 pips.

Yesterday is had 2 trades, EURUSD buy which gave me 50 pips and EURNZD buy which closed for 40 pips.  I could be missing out on more pips by using the trailing stop but I am unable to manage the trades throughout the day.

Good trading all.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
My take on this is that following the basic principles for entry as set out by The7 should be followed, meaning none of your chart examples are valid entries.

Whilst I haven't done any real backtesting I think it works as an entry mechanism, but care needs to be taken to manage exit strategy, to avoid giving back profits.

My view is to set an initial S/L of 100 pips, then once 100 pips in profit, trail it by 50.

By way of random example I've attached a chart of EUR/JPY with three recent entries. The first short would have exited at the reverse signal for a long on the pin for 100.

That long from the pin reached 100, so would have been taken out by the 50pip trail for +60.

There was no corresponding short, so the next entry is another long on 1 October, which would still be in play currently at +150, so with a 50pip trail, 100 pips in the bank. 260 pips from one pair over the last two weeks, has got to grab the attention.

There are of course losses in the system (in the example chart there are 3, 31 July, 15 Aug and 31 Aug) but as the author suggests, if this is operated on multiple pairs it should smooth out.

I for one will be looking into this much more closely now.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I have been doing my testing with the candle opening outside the channel and closing inside. As The7 said there are no hard rules.

Personally I feel just using the wick leaves you without much room in many trades. I suggest you trade this on demo for a while and see what you would like to do.

Don't get too hung up on rules

--- 帖子 #136 ---

Hi Folks,

It could be amazing system if there are some fails entries be filtered.

Please see the attachment where failed entries happened.

What's your ideas ?

@Exiter135: Check the indicator if it helps :-).

Regards,

VnTrader

--- 帖子 #140 ---
You are really fast . Thank you mate!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thanks for posting the indicator, very kind.

The7 started this thread as a daily strategy, however I see your chart for Gold is 15min.

I posted earlier that on a daily tf, setting a 100 pip initial s/l then trailing it by 50 once +100 had been reached often (not always) protected against sudden moves against trend to lock in some profit.

Perhaps a similar approach could apply in the 15m tf, but personally I wouldn't trade gold in a short tf with this kind of strategy, it is too choppy, for gold I feel longer tf's are better. Mind you taking the long 15m tf entry at 1768 prior to the NY open on 1/10/12, would have worked nicely !

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi and sorry for my very bad english, I'm frenchy

May be we can filter with a simple MACD in higher time frame.

If we trade H1, filter with MACD H4 or / and D1

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I prefer that the candle open be outside the channel. It is working well for me, but you never know when the other shoe will drop.

Rob

--- 帖子 #144 ---
If the signal candle has a wick towards the direction of the trade, try to avoid the entry. If there are long wicks on both sides the candle, avoid the entry.It shows uncertainty. The only wick we want to see is a pinbar...

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I would not take the entries for Blue#1,4,5,9. Watch their wicks...

Hi The7,

please don't take this as a dig because I actually like the look of this simple method but looking at your trade explorer over the past year seems to contradict your claims of using it sucessfully for the past 6 months. Was it with a different account?

Dave.

It is from a different account I was using.

Aud/Jpy and Aud/Nzd Buy Long for the day. Nice S/R levels at round numbers and a nice pinbar for the first pair..

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi The7 ,i notice the pair you mention earlier,just one qurstion,there is upcoming high impact news coming in abt 1hr time ,so do you still open buy pos when the candle close or you wait for the news to come out first?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Following this would have wiped my best 3 trades

I focus on where the entry occurs on the chart. Using "Sixth Screen Version 3.6" Indicator. I only buy when the candle is in the lower 1/3 of the screen and sell when in the upper 1/3. I do not take the trade if the wick pointing in the same direction as the trade is a lot longer than the opposite wick.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi mates. What do you think about tma slope filter? I don't trade this ones. Everyone hit a 20 pip tp except the 2nd one in the european session. Sorry for my bad english. Regards.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
First off, thanks for sharing your trading system.

IF I will be trading this system, I will like to apply MM thus, I will use a stop and take profit. This is partly due to the fact that I want to know exactly how much/many pips I will be making or losing. This said, below is the way I will be using this system.

I will follow the rules you posted on the first post but like I said, with my MM and SL and TP. My SL will be the low before my entry while my TP will be 1.5 times my SL.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
How do you decide to set TP at 1.5x the risk?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi Traders,this is my MM,my MM you can take partial profit and let the remaining lots to run till the trend dies off and at the same time you can trail the remaining 0.1 lot manually.

Eg:open lot size 0.5 with hard stop loss of 150 - 200,once pos move to 50 pips in profit, close 0.4 lot and move stop lose to 100 pip, if the remaining 0.1 were to hit the sop loss,you still walk away with some pips in hand.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Not a very good idea. With a 1.5 TP, this system is losing money on all currencies. Here's the equity curve with your TP:

http://zorro-trader.com/Log/The7_TP.png

TPs almost always reduce the profit of trade systems - there are few exceptions - and often turn a winning system into a losing one. You should reconsider your MM method.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
hi 7

if based on your rules

are the marked numbers valid entries?

also the pb?

cheers

--- 帖子 #159 ---
OK. I don't know how you came up with that but what I am saying is this: If my SL is 100 pips, then my TP will be 150 pips. I prefer to re-enter later when I get a divergence in MACD.

This way, I will have my balance increasing and also my equity.

Yes. Its true that TPs always reduces potential profits but that's the way I will want to trade this system. I have been using the risk reward ratio of 1:1.5 for a very long time now and most of my trades gets to my TP. This is better for me.

--- 帖子 #160 ---

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I understand your intention. But in reality you will just have your balance decreasing and also your equity.

Any trade system relies on a ratio of winning and losing trades. It is only profitable when the winners make more profit than the losers take away. When you reduce the profits of your winners, for instance with a profit target, you tilt that ratio towards losing and make the whole system unprofitable. As you can easily see when you do a backtest - just look at the equity curve.

This is not to say that a TP is always bad. It's only bad for most systems. Such as for this.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
This I know and that's why they teach us to use 1:2. But the truth is, does it always work. Thus I derived my own formula

--- 帖子 #163 ---
My SL is gotten from the highest high and then I multiply this by 1.5 to get my TP

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Could you share the tma slope indicator....like to look at it...thanks in advance!!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Looks like AU could be a buy, but I have 10 hrs. before my candle closes

--- 帖子 #166 ---
didn't want to comment, but on second thought, i should pay back to the thread creator for this great system by help clarifying the core idea.

your TP vs SL 1.5 will fail this system.  simple as that

feel free to try though

i guess the7 might have similar thoughts, and JCL already posts his statistics that are almost same as my tests.

the system is to capture a trend to earn, not a 1.5x SL (the signal bar length) to earn.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I hope you guys have not missed the XX/JPY run.

Aud/Jp +13,

Cad/Jpy +52,

Nzd/Jpy -14 pips so far and counting...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I always loved the 5 Ema indicator...If you are looking for a more conservative approach, try entering the trade when candle closes above/below 5 EMA close.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
THe7 ,Can you show some of your entries on the Yen trades?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Nice system, thanks for sharing. The good thing is that it can be combined with any other system for extra confirmation

--- 帖子 #171 ---
a more conservative way of entering, especially when the weekly trend turns around is feb2865`s with irony thread.

on the daily chart he waits for the down trend to stall with a pinbar or bull bar, second candle a bull bar for confirmation and enters if the top of the second candle is broken.

pyramid in aggressively a la pipeasy - millepede thread - , and bring your trades to BE before attempting the next trade.

when you have a nice run, you`ll be making a ton of money; lots of small losses and some huge wins.

The7: anyway of scaling in along the way?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks alot for the suggestion, kbeza.

I have a new version of indicator which shows much better results as the attachment EVENT with M15. It removes most of the failed signals especially in case they violates with the TREND.

Of course we must have a suitable MM strategy to minimize the RISK beside the filters.

Sincerly,

VnTrader

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Not a pin on my broker candle times, but still a valid entry so I'm in.

Shame i've only picked up on this thread in the last few days, had I been in a week ago, I could have picked up all the yen trades our thread starter has just closed for +500. Not too shabby for a week's work!

Interesting, on my broker's platform, your spinning top prior to your entry candle closed lower and on the 4H tf would have triggered an entry at circa 1.2694.

As I said in previous posts though i am sticking to the daily tf discipline so won't be taking this.

It does look a bit overbought on daily thoug, so could be good for some pips on a retrace.

Cheers

I was up +40 at the height of today's candle, but NFP has worked it magic and currently down 40! Sticking with the rules though and won't close early unless my stop under the entry candle is hit.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I have MPTM set to capture the first 30 pips for this very reason. I'm pretty sure my trade closed out around +40(not at home right now). I'm breaking the rules, but my hit rate is almost 100%.

I was stopped out of AUD/USD for -83 pips today. Anyone else take that trade that went straight south? It was a valid entry and looked like a really good setup with the double bottom/bullish divergence too.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Candle closed at the channel not inside it on my Daily FX chart. No trade for me.

The thread results might be more consistent if we all used the same charts that The 7 does, that close at the same time GMT.

I know the older version TMA slope repainted, but appearently this version 1.4 incorporates TMA True numbers also, plus if used on the daily, repainting shouldn't be much issue.  but testing it now anyway

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
This is the only trade I've made that doesn't look like it'll make any money. It was hard to tell if the candle body was inside the channel, but I went for it anyway, since I was hoping for a bounce off a potential triple bottom. If there is no support from this chart pattern, I fully expect it to hit my SL. Live and learn.

Rob

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Nice system it seems!  One thing i do not totally get is the stop.  Are you using the last swing high/low as the stop or the high/low of the bar that closed back in the channel?  Thanks

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Yeah, That is exactly how I saw it.....I thought it could have been a great setup, but mine turned out a loser. lol It's ok, I can accept losers so.....no biggie.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I was in the NZ/US, took me out at -100.  Frustrating given it's my first trade, but not put off. It's just a matter of timing, another contributor to this thread has been up 755 pips, because he started taking trades before me.

It will even out, there won't be 755 to bank every week, but by the same measure, there will be weeks with no losses.

Lets see what next week brings. I plan to test it on a live account and will post my progress as it develops.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
The information you are supposed to glean from the post is that it is a more profitable system when using TMA indicator mentioned earlier.

So many false signals maybe just put a 50  moving average and trade with the trend

but i truly doubt the idea that's been tried to convey here.

why ppl so crazy about the magical TMA?

for that graph, from 1st look,  you might guess it might contain less than 20 or 30 trades? why is it sufficiently significant to judge TMA is magical?

you need more than that to be meaningful.

Which TMA?  True or Norm?

With any trend indicator you are going to miss alot of those top and bottom reversals which this system really nails. That's why diversification is key!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I do not know what is the different between them. I guess they all repaint. But I don't care because they just give me a reference how strong the trend is so that I won't randomly take any signal.

I do not want to high jack this thread with TMA stuff. The7 system is very good without any other indicators.

Sorry my mistake, I wasn't down -100, I've just checked again and I'd set my stop at just below recent price action, so my loss was -75.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
My entry was long on the 4 October daily candle, which met the rules, opening below the EMA channel and closing inside it.

My SL was below the recent low, so was actually -75 pips not the -100 I'd posted earlier.

I saw someone else mention GBP/JPY. I took that on the close of Friday's daily candle and am currently +75.

hi all,

been following the thread for a few days

pretty sure i have the rules understood and now to start testing

i may use one of the codes posted earlier for back testing

as for the EURJPY trade, unfortunately i have another 11 hours before my candle closes so cannot enter the trade until tomorrow

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Closed out my G/J trade for +110.

My rationale is that whilst a clear entry using The7's entry method, it was against the longer term prevailing trend, PA was stalling at previous S/R.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
There u go mate.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Nice entry, your broker must be in a different time zone to mine. (CET time, 2hrs in front of London), Friday's candle on my platform closed at 102.54, therefore outside the EMA channel, no entry.

I suspect the converse will happen at other times, where I get entries that you don't, I can't see it will make much difference in the long run.

Cheers

Thank you for the screenshot. Looks great.

I just found your thread the7. Looks like we have a couple of good entries for tomorrow. What dou you think?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi TradingDrunk, Can i know the name of your broker?

thanks

Hello friends

EU seems to be about to give a buy signal end of this hourly candle in about 3 mins

Opened outside below EMA and is currently likely to close inside

Cheers

DD

--- 帖子 #248 ---
5 candles before, the same thing happened, but it didnt respect the ema.

I have entered the trade though, and its +8 right now.

I also longed EJ (looking at the H1)

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I don't trade this on hourly, but I agree this looks like a good place for a long, it's oversold on the H1 and bouncing off some MA's, but only as a short termer. On the daily, PA is sitting below the 200EMA and unless it pulls back from the current sell off quickly, is set to make a lower high, likley forcing it further downwards.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Looks like possible sell bars on EJ and EN, but got 11 more hrs for me.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I went in at 1.2956 and closed it at 1.2971.  +15 pips.  With US closed no point waiting for any big moves  until tomorrow.

Might get whipped about in the choppy illiquid market tonite

Cheers

hi traders, i think for this night are a few trading opportunities

cheers

--- 帖子 #256 ---
on H4 right?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
on 4hr e/u long

--- 帖子 #259 ---
-))my first trade on this beautiful and simple system, and today a have +140 pips in my acount-)))

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Nice one, I took this too, but bottled it when the price stalled at 125.75, to close at +110. (Driven by the old fear and greed having had a 75 pip loss on my first trade with this strategy) Had I not closed out and stuck to just trading on closed daily candles, I'd currently be up 175.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I took the same trade for 100 pips. Good trade no?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thank you! I really like this idea and indi. Could you also put alerts on it?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
you can set it, @ input and then set enable alert from false to true

greets

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Does anyone else has EU and Ej short forming on the daily chart ?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
i wait till the candle is finished, ej hits the opposite ema this is no clear entry

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I can see EU,EN,EA AND CJ forming.

The signals on EJ and UJ are nullified as the candlesticks touched both the lines of the channel.

I am already in the trades for AJ and NJ.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Mine already formed today, but I am also using the TMA to help filter false signals and it's looking very promising......

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I actually do not have that option in the indi?? There isn't even an option for alert on mine? Hmmmm......

--- 帖子 #269 ---
right click in the chart, than indicator settings, than input thans see the enable signal, or email alert

--- 帖子 #270 ---
http://i47.tinypic.com/2a63wab.jpg

This is what is coming up on mine. Am I looking in the wrong spot?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
sorry your are right there is no alert, i meant the other indicator sorry my mistake

greets

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Anyone short on EU?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
look NZD/USD and aud/chf ???

--- 帖子 #274 ---
AU NU are bullish that's what stopped me from going short

--- 帖子 #275 ---
thats what i mean long i took see how it is going on

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I understand this indicator may repaint color. Does it repaint the height of the bars too? Thanks

--- 帖子 #279 ---
not sure and I don't care whether it repaint or not. Just use it as a reference.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
open positions:

AJ- Long

AU- Long

UC- Long

EN- Short

EU- Long (just going for 30 pips or so) almost there

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thanks. Using it the way you described i.e. 0.4/-0.4, you could let it run on the 4 hour TF and exiting when below the respective threshold. This is the reason for my question. Check your chart and see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
why uc long

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Yea, it's not a perfect set-up, but the 3 blue bars are pretty close.

That's why I'm only going for 30 pips or so.  almost at 20 now.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
i see i thought you mean usd cad

--- 帖子 #285 ---
daily shows sell signal. not sure where you got buy from.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
As per the rules EU/NZ sell, already bank in 50 pip and now holding the remaining lot

--- 帖子 #287 ---
many mistakes on your indi, please correct them.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
It's really taking off today.

Anyone else in these trades?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I'm having fun with this so far....!

Yesterday +110, so far today, I have shorts on EU/US, EU/JP and longs on US/CH and NZ/US, presently up +150 overall.

Didn't see the EU/NZ entry from last night, but is one I would have taken if I had, and is currently running at +70. Nice.

Thumbs up for your system THE7, thank's for sharing.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Nice trades, looks like you made 20% on your account today.

As a matter of interest how much % do you risk on each trade?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
As you know, Oanda doesn't have options that allow "high" and "low" settings on the MAs.  Any ideas on settings for channels using the Oanda charts?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Carmel,

I know this isn't exactly answering your question but I use Oanda and place my trades using mt4. Just letting you know the option is there if u don't already.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
What settings on Oanda do you use to simulate the EMA 5 hi and low?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hello The7 and others on this thread.I am one of the invisible members of this amazing system.Took my first live trade with this system on EURUSD with 102pips.Thank you so much The7.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Nice to see that some folks are making money. Please do nor complicate things with more indicators and EA's. If you can not look at your charts only 5 minutes a day( we are trading dailys right?) you should not be in Forex anyways..

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Don't get discouraged when you have losing days...Oh yes, you will have them

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Oanda does not offer High/Low setting for Moving Averages. Just use dailyfx for mobility..Smartphone users can download the MT4 app which shows H/Low's. Opening times might be different but it is an option..

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Sorry Carmel what I meant was I set up my oanda account to use metatrader 4. Think you just create a sub account and set it as metatrader.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi The7,

Looks like your system is having a good run at the moment :-)

I'm waiting for a string of losing trades due to ranging markets but am praying that if I follow the rules the winners will outweigh the losers (aren't we all). Looking good so far so thanks very much for sharing.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
According to the rules we have opened

Eur/Usd +100

Usd/Jpy +10

Gbp/Usd +130 (opened Friday)

Usd/Chf +60

Eur/Jpy +94

Aud/Usd +5

Nzd/Usd -10

Chf/Jpy +87

pips are approximate and they have opened yesterday..counting more pips..

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Just a quick update on my progress.

Since the 2nd October my £5K demo has grown by 5% with another 2% in unrealised profits.

I am opening with 0.20 lots in line with the rules, closing 50% at + 30 and moving SL to breakeven on the remaining lots, then a jumping stop of 30 pips (Steve's MPTM is great for this) to hopefully follow a runner and lock in some profits.

So far all looks great, I willl update again in a few days.

Indy360.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
It's not the system that has a good run at this moment, it is the market..Huge difference. The system just indicates the start of this run..The channel will avoid most ranging markets...But yes, you are right, there will be losing strikes...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Here is a sample showing what this system does in a scary ranging market. Amazingly there is only a minimal loss, matter in fact it was followed with a trend that turned into profits...

--- 帖子 #306 ---
The 7, THanks again for sharing the system, so much less stressful than day trading but more profitable.  How do you scan for trade set-ups?

Do you manually look through dozens of charts or how?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I'm only looking for setups on Dailyfx..Not scanning every other chart..

--- 帖子 #308 ---
The7, I know your basic rule is to exit on a signal in the opposite direction, but have you ever tried implementing some stop management?

I ask because you're carrying 476 pips in profit here, which is very impressive (I didn't get all of those trades due to my broker time zone, meaning some of your entry candles weren't entries for me so I'm +240ish), but over 300 of those pips are from recent strength in USD. Were there a swing against USD tomorrow you could give it all back.

I'm all for letting profits run, but the old mantra of never letting a winning trade become a losing trade keeps nagging at me, so I am thinking of at least bringing stops to BE at +100. What are your views on this?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I believe he usually opens two trades per pair.  Once the trade is up 30 pips he closes it and moves the stop on the other to B/E.  Pretty good MM although not what I'm doing at the moment.

the7 - Just wanted to comment, I tried to use this method on 1H and 4H timeframes, and it loses its appeal.  You have to watch the charts too closely.  Also fake reversals seem to abound.  I found that not only is a daily chart easier time-wise (I look at the charts at 4pm EST each day) but also reversal candles are much easier to see.

Still trading this in demo but so far its easy on the brain

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Great system The7! So you took all those setups even though the wicks on some candles were kind of large in the direction of the trade? I guess I misunderstood you before or I am being too picky about that.

What is the name of that app? I couldn't find it under Daily FX is it the FXCM app?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I started out with a 30 pips stoploss. On 0.1 lots I risked 30chf on each trade. On a 1000chf account it would give a 3% risk on each trade.

Btw looks like we have setups on eurgbp and gbpchf.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
hi traders, what are you thinking usd cad long??

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Usd/Cad had a nice pinbar couple of days ago but then stalled...Not a perfect setup I would say..

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi The7.

Thanks for a great system.  I work in lower time frames, and your system works well on the 1 hour so long as you only take the signals above (for longs) or below (for shorts) a higher ema, ie 60ema, avoiding the system when the 60ema is horizontal (ranging).  I only take contra 60ema entries on the 5ema hi/lo system when at major support/resistance, round numbers.

Thought this might add.

Regards

katie

--- 帖子 #315 ---
So you start off with a 30 pip S/L on all your positions?

The7 mentioned "Stop Loss is high/low from last candle."

For EurGbp I have a 51 pip S/L and GbpChf it's 106.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
"No hard rules...Nothing is written in  stone. Dont chase perfection  in patterns. Demo it for a while and you  will get the feel soon.."

The7

care to explain a bit more about getting mt4 on smartphones ? my smartphone is android based.

also, it may be a good idea to open a trade journals thread, so that people can go in and post signals on all pairs on a daily basis. rather than have this thread spoilt.  this thread should really be kept to discuss the system itself and any issues about it.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I am using an iphone and the app is called "MetaTrader4". You are able to add Moving Averages to it. I am very confident you can find it for Android as well.

A journal is a good idea, however I don't always find the time to commit myself..

Hi The7,

Sorry but I don't understand you.

As I understand your rules, only see a short entry, and no sign opposite to exit.

Can you tell me please what is the exit? And what would be a new entry?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Your Stop would be hit after 11 days of short entry..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Ahhh, ok. Is correct.

Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thank You the7 !!

...for Intraday traders, run the 144min and the 1440min chart together!

I tested this on a number of instruments Forex + Futures, it works like a charm!

If you have a reliable volume indicator this system with the right pinch of divergence is magic!

(:-D

and then on top of that if you are familiar with the market geometry, ...watch out!!

Since you'll be cleaning house.

All in All ---> Excellent strategy!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I know, my stops were a little tight. Still working on my MM and confidence.

if anyone is willing to open a trade trade journal thread for this system. please do so. the7 is unable as he has not enough time.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I use the metatrader4 app on my iPad, but it drives me crazy because I can't seem to find how to manually close a trade?! Once open it either hits TP or SL and nothing I can do about it. Any guidance would be much appreciated.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #332 ---
hi Ariadne,im sorry,if you dont mind can you explain this again abt the 144 min chart,how can i view the 144min togather with 1440 chart,hope you can clear my doubt...

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I feel a good filter for this if it can be indcluded in your indi is that it shows long arrows only if above a user defined EMA (say 200 as an example) and vice versa for shorts. What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Yes me too

It is a difficult decision whether to use a tighter S/L and have smaller but more frequent losses or to give a trade a chance run but risk a bigger loss.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi Edlich,

To close a trade on the MT4 Ipad App do the following...

Tap the Trade button on the bottom tool bar. This will show you what trades are open and their status....  Touch the trade you want to close... This will bring up your SL and TP and SWAP etc.... Now touch this part and keep yout finger on it for about 2 seconds and the options will appear to allow youi to modify or close your trade...

Hope this helps...

Blinkers..........

Thanks Blinkers, you're a star!

I suspect my data bill on the iPad will now be on the up.

@shaikjun

in the place of the Daily chart,

24hr = 1440 minutes

i find it to be sharper more reliable info then the Daily, also 1440min chart compiles the information exactly to the specs of your time zone.

meaning the next day starts at the beginning of the new trading session!

144min chart is just the downsize scale of the 1440min, 10 bars per day!

On intraday it is quite solid momentum reader.

If you are unable to be specific then i'd suggest

the Daily -120min

hope this will help clarify ? :-)

P.S.

....... as the price becomes detached form the (Blue River) :-) become suspicious of your position :-)

Since it seems that the market does not like to be to far from those levels :-)

On the other hand, price Surfing becomes another avenue to star exploring!!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi The7 and all together!

Thanks for sharing the system and ideas.

I start a trade like system which posted in first posting (daily) in EURGBP last night. I feel fine with this trade. I think, after correction it can be go in my direction. If not, next signal ;-) See Signal before. The same thing.

My timezone is Germany, Berlin (GMT +1). If you post charts too, we can check out by the other, which is best time. So we can adjust.

My chart:

Good Luck!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
While the method CAN catch a trend in the early stages, it's weakness is that it can also get into many consecutive losing trades by going against a strong trend and in very choppy conditions.

Not to rain on anyone's parade, but the attached chart validates what I am saying. It shows a period of time from July -  November of 2010 where there were 17 trades and 16 of them were losers. Plus 11 of them were consecutive losing trades.

Very few traders that I know of have the intestinal fortitude to trade a method like that.

And yes, I understand that there is no one concrete set of rules to this method, BUT it shows that just arbitrarily buying or selling when the market moves from outside to inside the channel may not be such a good idea.'

* I just realized that my screen capture didn't capture all 17 trades, but if you check your charts for the time period I mentioned you will see them

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Please go to page 1 and read the rules again. We are using Candlesticks, not HA candles. I looked into the same time period you mentioned (July-Nov,2010) with the chart I used, yes there were few losing trades but overall it turned out to be a profitable period...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I'm as cynical as the next man Robin but even from the trades that you did highlight I think from a cursory glance only 6 would have been valid trades. The previous days candle has to close outside the channel and the signal candle inside.

Correct me if I am wrong please?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Shouldn't chfjpy be a potential long?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I didn't pick the trades, nor does it matter what type of candles they are....BECAUSE the trades were chosen AND the arrows posted by the smThe7Signals_v1 indicator.

However, IF the indicator is just flat out wrong that many times, then that changes things. But visually they all look correct to me.

I have attached a chart without the HA candles.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
A few losing trades? There are 19 trades during those 5 months according to the indicator and it appears to me that there are 15 losers and 4 winners IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY at each trade.

I would love for you to show me how the period I mentioned (AUDUSD - July-Nov,2010) was profitable just by buying/selling when the market moves from outside the channel to the inside.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thanks Robin,

From that chart it looks like arrows 3 and 6 are winners and 14 is unknown. Leaving 11 losers. Not a good sample that's for sure.

The7 recommends using this over numerous currency pairs though and letting the winners run to offset the smaller losses so I suppose we'll just have to test and see.

What do others think??

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Doesn't look like a daily chart !!!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Here's the chart with all 19 trades:

@Ariadne Thanks for the clear explaination,now i got it

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Between June1st, 2010 and Jan 2011 the Aud/Usd produced 1583 pips. The chart below is from Ibfx. It is not fair, to show a time period with failed trades and saying this system is a bad idea. You have to look at the whole picture. I didnt even check what this system did during this time with other pairs...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
dont worry. criticism is good. it identifies any  problems and way to resolve things. better way of doing things. so let robin identify flaws.

only time will tell the viability of the method.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
dont worry The7. your system is excellent. i am agree with whatfx , time will tell you everything.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
most of these trades did not materialise. the only iable one i see at present is the sell on usd chf. so i have taken a sell on uc. see how this one pans out.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
usdchf did not close below the EMA

--- 帖子 #360 ---
it did on my chart. just below the ema. in fact it is a perfect sell setup. i dont have the chart in front of me, but if i remember correctly yesterdays daily close was a spinning top / pinbar. so a high probabilty trade. have taken sell.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
May be not on your platform mate. I did not enter the trade due to the long'ish tail though.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
It did on my platform (Alpari UK, working from CET zone GMT +2)

Wasn't the most emphatic entry, but as it formed a pin as a second rejection of 9400 which is also where the 200EMA sits, I decided to take it. Currently +15

Cheers

--- 帖子 #363 ---
now it seems like conflict of different brokers,so any idea which time zone to follow, im staying in asia zone and using thinkforex .

--- 帖子 #364 ---
i use mt4

T h à n k s

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I'm not too concerned about it, the market will ebb and flow the same for everyone, sometimes I'll get entries you don't and sometimes the other way round.

In the long run, this strategy will get us into enough positions to not worry about the odd one missed due to candle formations in different time zones.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I don't think it will matter too much over time so let's not get into a 3 page discussion about gmt+1 etc as happens on most threads. I think my broker daily candle closes about 04:00 gmt but I just put my trades on at approx 23:00 before I go to bed as that's what suits me. Sometimes I get a better price, sometimes worse but I can always adjust the trades in the morning.

I have to say that so far this strategy is working out well for me, currently got 11 positions open. Hope to post some charts later.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
yes you are right ,lets not hijack the thread to never ening time zone,agree this method is profitable ,will post the statment end of the month,

Happy pippings

--- 帖子 #368 ---
My trades so far this week:

Closed

NZ/US  - 75

GB/JP  +110

US/CH +  51

Open

EU/US  +85

EU/JP   +94

GB/CH  -40

US/CH  +15

EU/CA  -26

CH/JP   + 2

If I were to close every trade now, I'd be up +216 in less than a week. If this were to prove consistent, then there really is something in this strategy. Time will tell, but it's certainly got my attention.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I never said that the system was a bad idea.

I said:

"While the method CAN catch a trend in the early stages, it's weakness is that it can also get into many consecutive losing trades by going against a strong trend, and in very choppy conditions."

That's not criticism, it's just a fact.

Most daily trading systems are looking for a trend that they can get in and ride. They will be wrong more often than not because long trends are usually few and far between. But, a good long trend is what makes up for all the small losers, and then some, hopefully.

This system does it a bit differently. It tries to enter most often by going against the trend, and then hoping that a new trend develops almost immediately in the opposite direction.

Both ways can work, but both ways have weaknesses, and that's OK. It's just good to know what they are.

Some posters appear to be getting good results with it so far, which is encouraging, and I hope that continues.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Robin,

I too noticed this right off the bat.  You get a valid sell signal for example in a strong uptrend.  There is no corresponding buy signals where the candle enters from below the low EMA because the uptrend is very strong.  And this can continue for quite some time.

The solution to this that I am using is fairly simple but it is NOT part of the7's system.  What I do is put my stop as per the system, and if, after the sell signal I am stopped out, I go long ONLY if the next candle is a strong bull candle that opens and closes above the high EMA.  In other words, if the trend is extremely bearish, then I will trade in that direction.

I still take any new signals to sell - in which case my current buy would be closed out or stopped out.  Again - this is in addition to the rules of the system, but I've noticed it lets us stay in very strong trends when they occur.

I'll attach a screenshot of this as an example.

Seeing nice long candles forming on EU, GU, EJ

But my closing is in 2.5 hrs.

Anyone else getting similar?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
wow I am very impressed by the quality and relevance of your advice, here is a method to help me earn more money.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Got nice long candles entries on :

GU
EJ
EU

Still in AU from 2 days ago

--- 帖子 #374 ---
To add even furthermore to this wonderful explanation to which i myself fully concur with.
Observe the level of the closing/opening price of the candle.

As my trading mentor has told me a multiple of times, ...to imagine the bars as the elevator shafts and the levels where the candle is closing / opening as the elevator floor. Some people will be getting out, others will be getting in and the traveling of the new bar continues  therefore if the new bar is breaking the floor level of the previous candle, would be something to observe as a natural bias, provided naturally that one has time to observe the market on a more frequent basis!!

On the chart i have marked the closing level of the yesterday's bar as the BIAS level naturally we had a wonderful BULLISH signal on the pound, looking for the continuation and targeting the other side of the "Blue River"

....have fun everyone!!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I'm afraid the MT4 is not as flexible with the time frames.

I run on the Ninja 7 Platform

Basically, calculate the duration of the market in minutes and apply to your minute chart

So as with any instrument, if want to trade the E-Mini i'd take in consideration the 405 minutes that the cash market is open under.

NY opens at 9:30am-4:15pm that is exactly 405 minutes

Claro ?

Here is my EA backtesting for last three years turned 10k into 65k

--- 帖子 #382 ---
First, thank you for sharing this with us. I hope the rest of the people on this thread will respect your time and keep comments to THIS SYSTEM ONLY! Anything else should be PM'ed or better yet in most cases read all the posts and youll find the answer you are seeking. Also guys I have seen threads implode from getting too many guys asking questions and then the guy who started the thread quietly walks away and leaves 20,000 people all jabbering like old ladies. Maybe one of you can start a thread called: trading 7 #2 in which modifications to the system could be discussede there. My feel after 7 years on this board is we need to not fill up 7's mailbox so much that he doesnt bother to come here anymore. Im all for a second thread in which maybe programmers can tell us about backtesting they have dome on this and waiting for bar close to get out and all the variations they like. Im in! Just not here. Ok, my question for 7 is:

What I want to be totally clear 7 is...You state we enter on a close of the last baR AND ONLY EXIT THE CURRENT TRADE AT THE STOP LOSS WHICH WOULD BE: one pip under/over the high or low of the candle we got in with. OK, simple. But in getting out am I correct in assuming that WE DO NOT WAIT FOR THE CLOSE OF THE CANDLE. Once the high or low is breached we get out, CORRECT?

I would imagine for those who dont have the time that if they wait till end of day it wont kill them as there is a stop loss in place anyway, right?

thanks so much,

Silat

Sell at 0.8042 Close at 0.8064

I have had less time to take another signal. Wait for next.

Which are your SL/TP? Any trailing stop?

Amazing results....

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Which Currency / TF: Daily?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
all pairs and time frame DAY only ,exit manually if opposite colse

--- 帖子 #388 ---
You are correct - I'm only shooting for 30 pips. In many cases, I've noticed that the next bar after the entry bar will reverse and hit SL. I'm just going for whatever momentum is in the entry bar, which usually is at least 30-pips.

I also have a demo running, which is strictly by the rules. It'll be interesting to compare the results.

You idea of closing out half and letting another run is a good one. That will be my next project.

Was this live trading using an EA or manually? if EA, which one please?

http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/php....php?f=5&t=879   ??? Is this Xlitang? How do you wrote in the post #277?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
It seems that if the candle clodes inside the channel, but the hi or lo has crossed the opposite side, the indi rejects the entry.

It is possible to fix that?

I see 9 trades on EU since June, how would you have traded them? are there any more I've missed?  would you have taken all of them?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Is not an error.

The7 says in post #25, "If the candle touches both sides of the channel, I like to avoid the entry..."

--- 帖子 #395 ---
What I notice from looking at this chart is this:  If we have one candle that closes just outside the low EMA (for a buy) and the next candle closes between the low and high EMA's, then do we have a signal?  I'd say this is a valid question.  Otherwise there are fewer trades overall.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I would enter trades #2,4,5,6 and 9. The remainings are opposite pinbars or long wicks in the wrong direction. Hope this helps..

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Why not the #3? Seems good to me...

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Sorry, I missed that. #3 is a good signal as well

--- 帖子 #399 ---
You would take 4 but not 8? even though 8 has a higher wick making it more pinbarish.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Which EU trade is that? not one from my chart posted above obviously.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
i earned last week so much pips i take50 pips each trade for a half and the rest i let run this i my strategy

--- 帖子 #402 ---
people, it would be much worth and helpful if you attach a chart showing the entry and exit point when you post about your trade.

you can do that by dragging the trade history onto the chart, then the entry and exit marks connected by a dotted line will be shown.

then take a photo image and attach to post.

otherwise it is useless and wasting the thread space and time to read.

Frani60,

Do you scan every pair for a set-up or certain ones, or how do you do it?

Thanks Much

--- 帖子 #404 ---
hello, i am from austria so i take always two trades @24 pm, one trade with tp 40 to 50 pips and the second i let run, so i look at 8 o clock in the morning, if the one hit my tp so i put a stop 5 pips at the second trade or i trail it with 20 pips i hope you understand what i mean, but it was really successful last week i hope i goes so on, i had no loss trade

greeds

ps I scan 10 pairs, i need 20 min time every day

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Is this a valid short? The body of the candle is inside the channel.

Similar to the Nzd/Usd long.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
normtold,

are you referring to the last candle? if so the rule says it wouldn't be a valid bar:

Here are the rules: Do not trade only 1 pair. Use your money management and positions wisely and allow room for as many pairs as possible. The point here is that we want the winners to outrun the losers..

Place a 5 EMA High and 5 EMA Low on the chart. Short when red candle closes inside the channel, long when blue candle closes inside the channel. Closing candle has to open outside the channel to become a valid signal. Let it run until you see opposite signal. Stop Loss is high/low from last candle.

it's not a hard rule, per The7 though ...

RS

--- 帖子 #407 ---
LOOKS GOOD

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Yes I was referring to the last bar.

Good point Risingsun, that would also invalidate the Nzd/Usd long although I know The7 has a thing for Pin bars.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
my chart is Oanda MT4, which changes the day in about 5 hours, so the current bar may develop into a long body one. whether the start was outside or on the 5 ema low is a bit uncertain to read but if the current bar body grows "enough" in 5 hours i may take a long. what is "enough"? well perhaps the wig gets much shorter...

note that stoch 7.2.2 has been crawling about the oversold area long enough and that encourages me to consider a long position.

RS

--- 帖子 #410 ---
ill scan one time in the morning abt 730hrs for setup,if there is any ill take entry at 800hr after confirmation,ive 2 account ,in one account ill take 80% profit of 50 pips and change the SL to -100 for the remaining 20%,in another account ill take 50% profit of 50pips and change the SL to -25 for the remaining 50%.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
In addition to the closed trades above of +86, I now have the following closed trades

AU/NZ  - 60

CH/JP   +  2 *

EU/CA  +140 *

EU/JP   +  3

EU/US  +  40

GB/CA  +100*

GB/CH  -  75

That is closed pips of +150. The ones marked * skew the true results due to my interference with stops etc. Had I not meddled/closed early there would be plently more.

CH/JP = I moved my stop to just above B/E after NY close on Friday evening, which got taken out by just 1 pip during the Asain open, before running on to be currently +175

EU/CA = I closed early, because I thought it may stall after a surge north, but was wrong and is currently trading at +100 beyond my premature exit.

GB/CA =  Same as EU/CA currently +110 beyond my early exit.

Current open trades are

US/CH  +115

GB/US   + 70

Potential so far then: banked pips +236. "missed" pips due to tinkering +385 and current open trades +185, making a potential  +806.

Please remember this is my own manual live trading, so I may not have captured all available set ups. Out of curiosity I ran a manual backtest for EU/US (obviously with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight) that produced +3100ish pips in the first nine months of this year, but that was applying some common sense filters, such as not taking trades that either were very long entry candles, or small pullback candles following large candles.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
There's definitely something wrong with this system chaps.....I'm currently up 528pips today

--- 帖子 #413 ---
It's great to hear that someone else is enjoying some success with this. I'd love to see a breakdown of where your 528 comes from, to compare notes, if you could spare a few minutes to provide the details.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi Edlich,

The trades are on my trade explorer and are all still open at the moment. I've been pretty loose with the rules though in that all trades we're opened according to the rules but I've then managed the trades. There were a couple where I should have reversed but I moved stop instead.

I'm going to spend some time rereading this thread and backtesting on this system to try and come up with some fixed rules for myself.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Ok Thanks. I agree re the management of trades, I'm using some simple EMA techniques and observing candle formations, particularly near the EMA's or S/R. Doesn't always pay off, like today on my CAD trades, closed them both as they stalled under the 200EMA, but then they shot through it for +100 each.

When I've got some more trades under my belt with this and got some good examples to demonstrate, I'll post examples of how I use these to help my management.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
This is a nice clean simple system.  Thanks The7 for sharing

I don't see much on the daily chart right now, but a lot of 4hr entries look to be shaping up on the current candle.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I could not spot any fresh trades today except Gold. I trade on Alpari UK. Could anyone else kindly confirm?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Gold does meet the entry criteria, but i've been burned by Gold's volatility in the past, so will only be taking Gold (and silver) trades if an entry is confirmed by my additional discretionary filters, which this current entry is not.

Currently in the green though, if you got in at NY's close last night, so good luck.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi do you have any indicators that you use as filters or is it just by eye?

Thx

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi

I use a 10EMA and 200EMA to guide on short and long term trend. I haven't started live trading this addition to the strategy yet, but I am monitoring it for effectiveness for scaling in.

I would post a chart, but can't today for technical reasons, so I'll try describe a set up.

For example, USD/CHF showed a possible entry on 10 October, with a small bodied pin. Others will no doubt see that this forms a double top with 1 October, but my additional MA filters show that the price action around 1 and 10 October represents a repeated failure to get over the 200EMA, which gave me added confidence to take the trade.

What I haven't done on the live trade, is take a second position on 11 October when price closed below the 10EMA and a third when price tried to get over the 10EMA but was firmly rejected by a doji on 15 October.

I am currently up 150pips on my single position, but had I taken trade 2, that would now be +115 and trade 3 would be +100, to give 365 pips in 5 trading days from one pair.

The example above, is a prefect textbook set up that is easy to analyse in retrospect, we'll see how it goes when I try it in realtime, which I may start from 1 November.

Hope this answers your question.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Certainly has been a killer week so far for this system.

Aussie and Aussie-Yen pairs particularly going to the moon today.

Based on the size of these candles I'm betting that we'll see some retracement tomorrow.  This makes me want to take profits now!

AUD/USD = up 118 pips from 1.0264

AUD/JPY = up 188 pips from 80.14

EUR pairs also doing nicely.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi normtold,

What is that indicator that show risk and how many pips for stop loss?

Im new here. Will try this wonderful system. thank you the7.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Which SL and TP will you use on those trades?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Lucariga, "Stop Loss is high/low from last candle."

I split the trade into 2, T/P for first half is 30 pips like Chicargo Rob does, the other half I let run.

Not a good R;R I know, just forward testing this on demo.

What S/L and T/P do you use?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Do you let run the other half till an opposite signal according to the7 rules, or you place another TP for the 2nd half? Do you use trailing stop or you place the SL to BE?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
with the permission of the7, i would like to start a signals thread for this method. on on the trading journals forum.

this will solely be for people to go in and post daily setups on diferent pairs, i.e. the pairs that are generating signals.

i think this will be a good idea and everyone will benefit from the signals posted on a daily basis.

no discussions will be held apart from posting the daily signals.

will that be of interest to everyone ? it will also stop the original thread being cluttered.

but for now, i see a buy on nzd/usd, and a sell forming on eur/gbp.

anyone agree.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I am in on the trades on both NU and EG.

The signals thread is a good idea, (as I missed the AC trade in the morning) as long as the7 agrees.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
hi Hinnavaru, can i know on which day did you get the signal for NU and EG, as i cant find it on my chart,if you dont mind can post your entry chart .

Thanks

--- 帖子 #433 ---
that is a good idea, but a dashboard with the rules as stated by the7 would be better and one would have the comfort of inputting the number of pairs to watch and see the signals as they develop

kos

--- 帖子 #434 ---
This will be a good idea but some people might not get same signals because of different broker timezones/start of day.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Guys, I did attached the7 (highLow) multicurrency display on rush so please test it before use it on live or so.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Personally, I find the entries very easy with this system.  Its the exits I'm still working on.

For example - today looks like a good time to get out of trades on GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY, CHF/JPY.  All Yen pairs if you notice.  they are all making nice pin bars, signalling possible reversal of current gains.

If you follow the exit rules, you'll sometimes lose profits.  This is part of the system.  For ex. on GBP/USD, the reversal today wiped out two previous days of gains, although my stop hasn't been hit.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
GBP/Jpy short could be a trade waiting for the next hour

--- 帖子 #438 ---
eur/usd, cad/jpy also I guess ...

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Eur/usd looks like a nice short as per system but it might turn out to be risky because of the summit day 2.

Is anyone going short on EU

--- 帖子 #440 ---
yes and nzd/usd too, with 30pips TP, and gbp/jpy for some pips today is friday

happy pipping and good night

greets

--- 帖子 #441 ---
So your short on EU what SL do you have in place?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi I'm short in eurusd also. SL = 1.31279.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
After trying many different methods I've realised that its a lot easier to enter a trade then to exit. The human emotions of fear or greed affect me far more later in the trade then when entering.

I've had to make peace with the fact that it is impossible to get in at the top and out the bottom of every move although the7's method is as close as you going to get for getting in to a trade as early as possible.

I've started using the Chandelier exit and have taken much more pips from every trade as a result. The beauty of this trailing method is that it gives your trade the appropriate breathing space in the beginning and then tightens up the stop when it runs out of steam (and you can adjust according to your risk for appetite). It happened this week with GBPCHF. I stopped out then the trade carried on--thats fine. Due to my stacking method I got 8 x more pips than with a single trade (Thats got not nothing to do with this thread though)

With this method of getting into a trade and exiting when the trade flattens out makes for a very potent combination.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I opened my first trade using The7's entry method ( I say entry, because I use discretionary exits rather than the reverse signal exit in The7's original rules) on 5 October.

In my first two weeks I have made a number of misjudments and missed a few entries, however I have just totted up and I have banked 408 pips on closed trades in those 2 weeks.

It has been a while since I've banked 408 pips so easily, I'm very impressed so far. Lets see what the rest of the month brings.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hello all four trades from last night now in profit closed because it is weekend

Congratulation !!!

On my side I keep them open over the weekend and already ready to take

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Glad to see that some people are making a use of this system. I currently have 3 trades open. Eur/Usd, GBp/Jpy and Nzd/Usd. All in the +30 and 50 pips range. No need to close trades for the weekend. Sorry I am not here very often due my other obligations.

Hi zortan,

I have a question to you regarding the band used in your indicator. What is your band as compared with ema 5 high/low band?

Thanks to all,

RS

--- 帖子 #451 ---
any experience you had to share?

maybe to post some charts to illustrate?

how to avoid, if any?

Rob

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Of course, please read all posts from The7 and you will understand the strategy.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Well lucia, I do not understand it either, so, as you can see, have asked cmeldatrader (who created that indicator) to explain and so far have had no answer yet. RS

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Because there are people who do not like reading, I summarized the strategy with the most important posts from The7.

I hope you do understand the strategy now.

The indicator developed by other people in the thread, does not work according to the statements by The7 and you should not consider please.

I developed an Indicator compliant the indicated by The7. I sent it to the last few days to The7 for validation. In any case I want to share with you for you please try it.

The only parameter of the Indicator is MinCandleSize, it's the size required to know if the candle is a Doji or not. In daily timeframe I use equal to 5 but if you want to use the Indicator in some little timeframe, for example M15, you need use a lower value, for example 1.

The strategy with this indicator is very simple.

BUY - When an up arrow

Stoploss = Low of candle showing the arrow.

SELL - When a down arrow.

Stoploss = Hight of candle showing the arrow.

Exit - When an up arrow should close all open SELL orders.

When a down arrow should close all open BUY orders.

Much success and hope for comments and observations.

Many pips for you!!!!

Thank you for responding to my question.  I did read whole thread but have missed what's the band for.  I will try to take time to review the whole thread again.

Lucia, the band is formed by two moving average.

Moving average 1 - Period 5 Exponential High

Moving average 2 - Period 5 Exponential Low

We should all use eastern standard time since that is NY time and if we dont we will all be  trading different systems. Or use whatever time  the 7 uses to start his day. to me using daily bars as this was intended, you may as well try using whatever bar your charts are set for.

My ONLY question is in the stop loss. Does it stay under the candle we opened the trade on or is it always moving top the very last candle in play. ive always left it at its first stop of the trade and its working well for me.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
hi whatfx can u share / direct the trading method you use? cheers

I Place my stop a few pips above candle previous to entry candle, not sure about anyone else.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
I have been trying this system on my demo account and have had mixed results. Some trades have panned out as planned and were very easy to identify. Times when pairs would be trending is when I found entries to be a little harder to predict, although this has been mentioned in previous posts.

Using the TMA slope gave a very good filter, but not many trades were shown and it seemed to look past very good setups. I added the ForexFreedom Indicator, which gave the trend for several time frames conveniently. I felt this has helped tremendously so if any of you guys are looking for a fairly decent filter, that's one I would recommend.

It goes to say if at the time of a valid set up (long/short) if all time frames show (uptrend/downtrend), it makes the entry far more reliable.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
where can we get this indicator? Thanks for your help. MSN

--- 帖子 #475 ---
This is the indicator I mentioned earlier. Ideally you want to take all your short signals when the most current squares on the indicator are all red, this shows a downtrend across the time frames. You want to take your long signals when all the current bars show blue. Again these are ideal for high probability trades, but most of the time you may get an unclear answers from this indicator, such as 2 reds and 2 blues or 3 blues and a red.

In such cases, trades are less probable, but hopefully we'll get a few opinions on here and if it isn't as great we can at least scratch that off the list.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
First time posting a picture so bear with me if it's rubbish. This is an example of the AUD/JPY as of now. As you can see the last bar is a strong bullish bar and has yet to close, although it is likely the bar will close within the bands as per rules stated. Below the graph you can see the ForexFreedom Indicator, with all its current squares at the furthest right all red, showing a downtrend in all time frames. These time frames usually would have their labels however they seem to have gone missing on my MetaTrader but from memory, I believe the top row is the 30TF then progressively increasing as you move down.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
The pips have dried up this week. My trades yesterday were stopped out and the ones that were doing well are now all closed. Got a few break evens too and at the moment I'm ahead so I'll continue with this. Got the following trades on tonight.

Short: AUD/JPY, CHF/JPY, EUR/CAD, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, USD/CAD

Long: CAD/CHF

Pretty much 1-2% per trade.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Here is my take

Flaw in the system is when starter of this thread suggests trading as many pairs as possible.Wrong.

One needs to understand correlations better and once understood focusing just few important pairs like Euro will make other pairs unnecessary to trade because of correlations.

Going large on key spots is lot better then scattering random orders hoping (pro-traders never hope)that one of them will become a runner.

For example I trade 80% only UCAD and know it thoroughly.I know about everything relating to Canadian currency,interest rates,oil prices etc.

I have an edge in knowledge.

Do you have the same edge in 20pairs? Chances are NO.Hence probability is not in your favor.

Popular myth  "don't put your eggs in one basket" does not work in Forex.

On the contrary razor sharp entry in right spots maximizes the profits not to mention lesser pairs have greater spreads not worth trading and less liquidity.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
My opinion probably not worth much but I had a look at 3 of your trades - don't follow the others. In the ej and aj trades I see that the lower wick is bigger then the upper wick so would have passed on those and with ucad I can't see any valid entry at all

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi Silversurfer,

thanks for the feedback. The USD/CAD was tight but I think it fits the rules (just) and it looks like a good trade.

EUR/JPY looks good to me despite the wick but I agree AUD/JPY is not a trade now. Thats the problem with placing the trades before the candle closes as otherwise I'd have to get up in the middle of the night to check them

--- 帖子 #481 ---
IMy chart on ucad must be different to yours unless you entered before the new york close which would probably explain it

--- 帖子 #482 ---
After careful thought, I have decided that the best set ups come when your near support and resistance levels. I have taken trades on 9 pairs in the past 2 days, 2 stopped out for a loss of 80 pips, 1 is currently in the red and the rest are going strong for a total of 200 pips. These were taken at points near strong support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
l

well, all you have to do is look at the naked charts. aud/cad was at very strong resistance level on the daily. it also formed a nice inverted hammer suggesting its on its way down. this therefore was a high probably trade to short.

similar thing on eu. was unable to break through the higher highs of daily resistance levels. stoch was overbought. .short entered via 15 min charts.

daily resistance / support levels are very strong levels to trade. usually result in high probability trades. so not to be ignored.

i closed both my shorts yesterday audcad + 50 pips, eu + 50 pips.  although eu is still bearish.

also presently short on eurjpy @ level 13373. currently running at +45 pips. will keep this one open.

short on gold since 15 october.

not a single loss yet so far this week.

"daily resistance / support levels are very strong levels to trade. usually result in high probability trades. so not to be ignored."

Pretty new to trading, can you elaborate what's daily resistance/support levels?  How to find those levels.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
That's good going.

I for one would be interested to see you start a thread on your trading method.

Regards

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Firstly you need to be aware of BRN = Big Round Numbers. This is where price ends in a say a 00, 25, 50 or 75. The7 stated he looks for rejection at 00 and 50 levels for confirmation of a trade. Bit of a self fulfilling prophecy at work with BRNs. Traders expect something will happen at these levels so a lot of orders are clustered at these levels. So guess what happens!

If price is trending up for example, what is going to happen when it reaches one of these BRNs? Is it going to break through it and continue rising or is the BRN going to act as a resistance level, so price bounces off it and retraces. The reverse for a downtrend, where the BRN may act as a support level. Some traders place a great deal of faith in BRNs, others ignore them. It is important to be aware of them though, especially when price is approaching say a 00 level and the initial impulse up or down is losing momentum.

Secondly, a Daily candle holds a lot of information that needs to be revealed by dropping to a lower timeframe. The Daily candle shows the OHLC - Open, High, Low, Close for the 24 hour trading day but we know little of the pattern of how price moved across the day. As a starter I would open a single chart and on H1, plot yesterday's Close, High and Low using a horizontal line for each. I only trade the Cable and still do this everyday by hand as it gives me a good feel and understanding of price. As the day unfolds you will see that these levels often act as support and resistance levels for price movement. Scroll backwards and forwards and you can also identify levels of daily resistance and support by placing a horizontal line on other price levels where price bounced off, reversed. You will see that a certain price level can act as both a support and resistance level at different times. Do some research on Pivots which are a more formalised method of calculating support (S) and resistance (R) levels.

What do you guys think about the set up on gbp/usd? Possible long?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
GU meets the set criteria, I have a concern in that eu and au are out of sync with gu - they tend to have reasonable correlation. If you take gu will you set a sl at 1.5913'ish - that's 120 odd pips which is a bit rich for me.

--- 帖子 #491 ---

Niji,

With all due repect to Lucia, this is becoming too complicated already and has ntoing to do with the system. if your more comfy and the "get in" bar closed at .00, sure you can wait one more pip to get in, but mostly those I find are rarely landed on and when they do, it acts as support, not resistance. so if i were going to get out at 99 on a short, either id just get out or wait for 01, causew now if your following lucia, you cant get out on 00 because all these 'secret" orders are supposedly there. I find i am usually better off not paying attention to them. and in my experience, 00,25 anf 50,75 have opposite effect is that they rarely close on those numbers. im just saying dont get so worried about it you miss getting in or out. Remember: THIS SYSTEM SAYS NOTHING ABOUT ROUND NUMBERS, OR MOVING AVERAGES, OR FIBS(my thing) OR YOUR BAD BACK, Its only about 2 5ema moving avgs used as bands. Period. Also i see a lot of you getting in on a tail getting thru the ema not the body, i am strict and wait for the body or I dont take the trade as in that canadian trade a poster  put up a few posts back. probably both will work. DONT SWEAT THE LITTLE THINGS, THATS ALL IM SAYING. SO FAR IM DOING WELL TRADING ON A DAILY AND A 30 MIN CHART FOR SPOT FOREX.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
well done to those who took the GU long trade. i missed the signal didnt check the charts.

and that is one of the reasons we need to have a signals thread for this method. i will open one hopefully in the next 2 days....

in the meantime looking for short setups on aud/cad, aud/chf, and usd/chf.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
WTF! See Post 43 for the BRN reference by The 7.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
After reading this entire thread and reviewing some historic charts I have a few thoughts/questions:

1. Has anybody tried closing their trades when the candle body closes outside of the opposite band?  For instance, you enter a short position when the candle body opens above the channel and closes inside the channel.  You close that position on a day that the candle closes below the channel.  I have noticed that if you wait for the opposite signal, many times you will close on a reversal candle that either wipes out most of your profit or even stops it out as a loser.  Down side is that you could miss out on a monster run.

2. Many times you will have a 100+ pip stop if you use the high/low for the last day.  Does anybody just use a max 100 pip (or whatever) stop or possibly just not take a trade that has a 100+ pip stop?

3. Money management - What percentage of your account are risking per trade?

I understand that there are no hard and fast rules to this system.  Just wanted to see if anybody else was already implementing these thoughts and if so, how they're doing.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Excellent idea. I, too, noticed many trades losing much of their gains when waiting for an opposite candle to close the position. I just checked some of my charts and found that using the candle-close outside the channel made some very good profits, which ranged anywhere from 30 to 100 pips, and more.

I have been trading with a 30-pip TP, in order to capture initial momentum on the entry candle, but I think your idea is better. I've also noticed that the wick will penetrate and extend beyond the outside band and then retreat back into the channel, so maybe taking profit at a point just beyond the outside band would prove beneficial.

Not trying to change any of the rules; just looking at different ways to take profit.

Rob

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi there to all! I´m a newbie in this forum and i´ve read this entire thread.

Congratulations for this simple but profitable trading system.

One question, do you guys enter a trade in the end of a friday or let pass the weekend and enter sunday night, or maybe monday in the open of Frankfurt/London open?

Thanks,

rjfvalente

--- 帖子 #500 ---
After spending some more time reviewing the charts I set some additional parameters for taking trades.  My goal is to eliminate some of the false signals and take only high probability trades.  I'm not saying this is better than the original system or even works, this is just what I'll be testing.
Determine the trend.  You can do this visually or with a 30-day simple moving average (close).  Only trade against the trend if you have a strong reversal candle such as an engulfing or hammer.  I have noticed that the system sometimes will give false signals when taking trades against a strong trend.  I like to trade with the trend. Any signal candle with a longer wick inside the channel than outside the channel is not a valid signal. This is a sign of potential weakness. I'll use my judgement and sometimes break this rule if the inside wick is not long. Trades are closed upon completion of a daily candle that pierces the opposite channel.  The is to avoid a reversal day that takes back profit or turns a winner into a loser. Stop/loss is set at high/low of previous day. I don't like how high the SL sometimes is but I haven't found a better way. There's not going to be as many trades but hopefully the win/loss ratio will be slightly better.  Looking at Friday's candles I would take GBPUSD short.  Not the best looking candle, but a trade with the trend nonetheless.  I would also take USDCHF short. Also not a strong candle either but I'll take it and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
If you close on candle piercing the bands does that not take away from the whole concept of let your winners run? Seems you would end up with small winners vs. small losers. The edge of this system is to catch large moves to offset the break even/small lose trades.  All trends have reversal days, no way to avoid that. You would never catch a large move exiting at first candle pierce.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I see your point about letting the runners run.  I still feel like I need a good reversal candle in order to take a trade against the trend.  I see too many examples of short signals in an uptrend that are stopped out the follow day. I think I'll use my parameters regarding trading against the trend but let the trades run until I get the opposite signal. There's many ways to skin a cat here.  The7 gave up a great framework to play with.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
You can also see example where an uptrend/downtrends have reversals that last a few days and those can be profitable too. But I see your point. You can always make your own set of entry/exit rules that you feel most comfortable with.

Hi jcl365,

"I can post the code here if someone wants to reproduce the result. "

would you mind posting the code as I'd like run a b/f test on it to validate the result?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #508 ---
ONly set-up I've seen is GU short, took it for 20 pips and out on account I'm on the east cost.  Could have held for double that easy. oh well.

Chicago Rob,

Can you share your MPTM settings for taking 30 pip profit and letting rest of lots run  or trail?

THanks

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I believe that JCL365 was labeled a commercial member because he kept mentioning the testing platform that he was using to get these results.  He openly admitted that he was involved with the company in at least a few of his postings and he mentioned the name of the platform several times.

Having said all of that, I think the great think that JCL365 brought to the forum was that at least he was doing some back testing.  This is an approach that is actually easy to back test (unlike most on forex factory), so it is amazing that more people have not actually taken the time to thoroughly back test it.  Perhaps you can write to TWEE and determine if JCL365 was indeed banned.  Also check the commercial section....I think that he had started a thread at some point....and that is probably where it is now.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
In the past, I was just using a 30-pip hard TP, with a hard SL. I'm thinking about changing over to a BE-pips, partial close approach, which is available in Hopwood's EA

--- 帖子 #515 ---
McPip,

I think it is a general rule on FF...as soon as someone comes out with an idea, people jump on it hoping its the best next thing....as long as the hipe is being maintained with or by winning trades postings...the thread will continue and so on..

On the flip side, testing in MT4 any strategy is a joke....i petty anyone putting their money on a EA tested on MT4....

As for JCL, don't think it bothers me that he is or was a commercial member, he made a few goood points ( for those statistical science inclined ) As far as the testing platform goes, it is free so if he was trying to sell it ....well who buys it is an idiot....due diligence is a must

Now to my real request : I am have been developing a strategy based mainly on the same principles....more or less ...traded on 4h and daily and it works well on discretionary trading. Testing it on MT4 as I mentioned before is a joke, so what i am looking for is a a way to validtae JCL's test in order to see if my testing platform yelds the same results in order to gauge the validity of the tests on my startegy and this one as well.

Because I always like to give back where I am taking from, if all goes well I will post my results on the testing of this strategy as well.

On a side note, this strategy is positive if you apply proper MM.

Good traing ya'll

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Not sure you would call this a strategy. It basically assumes a reversal pattern and hopes its not a continuation. I suppose like any market, eventually you run out of the stops being taken out. If you can figure out the filters, than you win. If not , you give it up

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Very good indicator. The alerts would be even better. What a pair, audio, e-mail notification ...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I think this system could work very well and i love the fact is so simple. Any way, in a strong trend it tend to have so many losses (see picture below). I think if we can limit those losses, this system could be perfect. Any ideas?

Sorry 4 my english

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi, i think, in a strong down trend like this if you buy, you should take some profit when price touch EMA high and stop loss to BE. It would be better waiting for a sell signal.....

sorry for my english too

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Ok, but the problem is that in a strong downtrend, the prices often never touch the High EMA....

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Breakeven pips and partial close

--- 帖子 #522 ---
This is what I was talking about in post #502.  I will only trade against the trend if I have a  strong reversal candle such as an engulfing or hammer. I am using a 30-day SMA to determine the trend.

I am currently short GBPUSD from 1.6090 and GBPCHF from 1.5010.  Both trades looked like good downtrends.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
These are the daily and 4 hour charts respectively.  If I scale down to the 1 hour I can get a pretty clear picture where things may go through use of Fib levels and Support and Resistance:

--- 帖子 #524 ---
1 hour entry  based on the aforementioned analysis....crucial fib levels here will decide my entry

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Be nice if we could keep this thread with the original system presented on the 1st post without extra indicators, confirmations, MTF's , etc.

Really clutters things up...

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Why? the original system is kind of in need. If it worked, their would be people whooping it up cause a 5 year old could program this into an ea. You get caught into a contracting triangle or ascending zig zag and this system  is on the road kill expressway...just like about a thousand others on this site.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
care to share your trade for understanding?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
The idea behind my "cluttered" charts was this:  if you BLINDLY trade into the Daily signal you may be trading right into a major fibonacci and or support/resistance level...and using the different time frames and a few trendlines can offer you a better entry....once price penetrates through said levels....you have entry confirmation......the core idea of any successful strategy is Buy Low/Sell High....trendlines and fibs are just a tool to enhance any strategy, regardless.....happy pips!

--- 帖子 #529 ---
You may be right, but now you have a different system.

We should respect the starter of the thread by trading according

to the original system strategy.  In this way, we either prove the system works over time or it does not.  If not we have 50 different systems being traded in the same thread.  Anyone is free to start their own.

But it's alot less confusing , especially to newbies to this system ,if we are all looking for the same set-ups. The key here is simplicity.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
With all due respect, I did take that into consideration, however I have seen posts here where people are struggling with the idea of different timeframes and I just wanted to throw some things out there: Quote from 1st paragraph of the thread:

"Here is a trading system I have been using for the last 6 month with  great results. The idea is "cut your losses short and let the winner  run" I am trading only the Daily Charts on dailyfx. It is a web based  chart which allows mobility. I am only trading daily's but feel free to  test it on different timeframes."

--- 帖子 #531 ---
If there isn't defined entry and exit you  basically have an "eyeball" trade and that is going to be difficult to be a successful for most. Its like picking a moving average and saying if you just sold or bought right there-- you win.......Now, If you stated to only trail after x bars at a minimum of x pips and only close on x number of bars when the market moves x number of bars at this indicator levelon a consistent basis or look for x that has an edge.... .... ...you have a better shot at a good system. Just sayn. I would like to know those pieces. If not, its trial and error. I have a lot of systems that are trial and error. Maybe, there isnt one on this type of move that gives consistent edges ..I don't know.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
What I was attempting to do was to show how different timeframes can confirm or disqualify an entry.  Obviously, if we trade WITH the higher TFs then we usually have Momentum on our side...as for the SPECIFICS on entry...that would be a whole new thread.....however, there are alot of resources in youtube that can break it down...one of my favorite indicators is the rubicon indicator and I often use it for entry on the pullback:   Inserted Video

....however, that being said, you could even use a 5ema and enter on the pullback as well......in the lower (5 min)  timeframe once the 30 min signals a trade....

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Sadly, it is always the case that the main thread is hi-jacked and totally deviates from the core purpose.

The 7, any recent insights that will help us move this on??

--- 帖子 #534 ---
can't agree more

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I think you are wrong.

The logic is being kept, but people add or change indicators because they do not have confidence in the system yet, or because they cannot see entries as per the original description.

without change nothing improves. even if is a negative change, it still proves that the original was better and hence revert to the roots

let them be, to each his own

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Sure, I took three trades this week. I am using my parameters of only trading with the trend unless the signal candle is a hammer or engulfing.  I am also testing three exits. #1. Close trade on close of day with candle ending above/below opposite EMA. For example, you go short when a down candle pierces upper EMA and then close the trade the following day when the candle closes below the lower EMA. #2. Set a take profit for the opposite EMA so that whenever the price hits that target you will exit the trade. #3. Follow the7's rule of waiting for opposite signal. Here is how I fared:

Sunday night (EST) went short GBPUSD @ 1.6090 from 10/26/12 signal candle

#1. Closed at 1.6028 for 62 pip profit

#2. Closed at TP of 1.6017 for 73 pip profit

#3. Price reversed and stop loss triggered at 1.6143 for 53 pip loss

Monday night went short GBPCHF @ 1.5011 from 10/29/12 signal candle

#1. Price reversed and stop loss triggered at 1.5071 for 60 pip loss

#2. Closed at TP of 1.4973 for 38 pip profit

#3. Price reversed and stop loss triggered at 1.5071 for 60 pip loss

Thursday night went short GBPUSD @ 1.6124 from 11/1/12 candle

#1. Closed at 1.6019 for 105 pip profit

#2. Closed at TP of 1.6062 for 62 pip profit

#3. Floating a 62 pip profit over weekend

So here are the totals for the week:

#1. 107 pip profit

#2. 173 pip profit

#3. 113 pip loss, 62 pip floating profit

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Very interesting cwp, thank you for posting that. Obviously 3 trades is no where near enough but I might think about running an experiment along similar parameters on another trade explorer account.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I think the entry rules are clear and perfect, i trade this system since the beginning, and i never made so much pips in such a less time, the problem is to manage the trade, for me the best manage is to close half at +30 pips and the rest be+2, ok sometime you ditnt hit the big run, but there are every day so many opportunities for making pips

cheers and nice weekend

--- 帖子 #539 ---
CWP, can you post some screen shots of what you are explaning?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #540 ---
True, and it can kill the thread in no time...

--- 帖子 #541 ---
This chart shows the last trade. Down arrow shows entry candle. You could argue that the body might not have been exactly a perfect system candle but I felt it was a good entry so maybe it was a judgement call.  Horizontal red line at 1.6062 shows where you would set TP if you use exit #2 from my previous post.  This is the lower EMA value on the day of the entry candle. Horizontal red line at 1.6019 shows exit based on exit #1 which is close of day on a candle closing below opposite EMA.

I agree.  The entries are very good, they just have to be managed. I enter the trades manually and I'm using an EA that closes 4/5 of the trade @ TP = SL/2 and lets the last 1/5 go until reversing signal or stop loss.   I have done very well with this management of the the entries.  I'm determining lotsize by 1% risk and rounding to the nearest lotsize divisable by 5.   It is kinda kookie but it works. Thanks for a great concept "The 7"   TCO.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Silversurfer. An interesting angle in that you trade only the next candle following the entry candle. This has worked well in the two examples you show, but how would you deal with a candle following entry that goes against us, do you close at the end of that day or wait for either the stop to be hit, or to resume the trend in the direction of the set up candle?

I'd be interested to hear how you'd have dealt with the entries given on this GB/JP pair on 18th and 23rd October.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi i took also chf/jpy and i take two trades first with 30-50 pips tp if this is hit i put the sl to be +5 pips and let it run

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I haven't really worked out an optimal exit strategy as yet. I didn't trade the gj on the dates you mentioned but in looking at them they fitted the criteria. I'm just really testing this approach and whilst it is n my live account I'm only trading micro lots, starting to lean towards taking partial profits at the opposing ema and letting the other position ride. I haven't traded every setup in the last 2-3 weeks but the ones I have I have made good pips on them circa 220 on 4 trades.

I like to use this system to give me an idea of the bias for the day and then use another system on M15 to take more aggressive positions - seems to be working out so far. The other system is the Genesis thread on FF.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Just in Nzd/Jpy and Aud/Nzd tonight. Wicks in trade direction isn't the greatest scenario but just in for 1 lot each.

Seems TmaSlope indicator help you to filter entries by identifying the strength of the trend ?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
It can...the only time I use it is when the levels cross the 0.8 line, which indicates a very strong trend, I will not trade against it until it comes back below that line again

My original demo did really well, but I had to eliminate it when I performed disc cleanup duty. This is my second demo, with all trades executed with Hopwood's EA, with BreakEvenTargetPips at 20, and HalfCloseEnabled = True.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
CR,

Can you send an actual screen shot of Hopwood's MPTM with the settings you mentioned?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #558 ---
This is the actual EA, not just a trade manager(attached, herewith).

--- 帖子 #559 ---
The one thing I don't like about Hopwood's EA template is how huge it is.  It's so full of everything including the kitchen sink that you can't tell where the kernel of the actual system is.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
So does this take the trades automatically or just manage them for you?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
well said!!.

......however...you can't argue with "FREE"...anyway...thanks Rob!!

--- 帖子 #562 ---
What I am trying to have the MPTM do is close half position at , say 30 pips, but leave the other half at the

original stop loss and move incrementally at certain target levels.

Is that even possible?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Yes, it is possible. Do the following:

Remember first that  MPTM's all parameters are set to false as downloaded, per Steve.

Manage all trades = true

Jumping stop = true

Jumping stop pips = 30

Part close enabled = true

Close lot = 1.0

Preserve lot = 1.0

This is if total lot is 2.0. If total lot is 0.02 then input 0.01 and 0.01 respectively.

With this setting, half of your lot is closed with 30 pips profit, stoploss is moved to zero (breakeven) and the preserved lot will be held until PA turns back to the jumping stop increments and closed.

You can even add a pip or two to breakeven level instead of zero. Figure out what you would need to input and where. A little quiz for you

Demo it first.

Good luck.  RS

This NJ trade stopped me out for -45, but, in hind's sight, having my stop above the previous swing high instead of the bar before entry bar

would have brought nice gains although risk is greater.  Anyone else have experience of what works better?

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Yes thanks RisingSun.  Actually all I want the MPTM to do is close half position and bag 30 pips.  no break-even and nothing else.

Last week's 11/2/12 GBPUSD trade would have closed on 11/6/12 @ 1.5989 for a 135 pip profit

Update for this past week:

11/6/12 buy AUDNZD @ 1.2558

#1. Closed at 1.2604 for 46 pip profit

#2. Closed at 1.2588 for 30 pip profit

#3. Floating a 186 profit over weekend

11/7/12 buy EURJPY @102.80

#1. Stop loss at 102.43 for 37 pip loss

#2. Closed at 103.37 for 57 pip profit

#3. Stop loss at 102.43 for 37 pip loss

11/8/12 sell AUDUSD @ 1.0403

#1. Floating a 45 pip profit over weekend

#2. Closed at 1.0360 for 43 pip profit

#3. Floating a 45 pip profit over weekend

11/8/12 sell CADCHF @ .9486

#1. Floating a 22 pip profit over weekend

#2. Floating a 22 pip profit over weekend

#3. Floating a 22 pip profit over weekend

Totals for for two weeks:

#1. 116 closed pips, 67 pips floating

#2. 303 closed pips, 22 pips floating

#3. 211 closed pips, 253 pips floating

Interesting, the strategy to set a TP on the opposite EMA (#2) has yielded 100% winners (one floating). the7's strategy of closing on the opposite signal (#3) has yielded the most pips, counting floating trades.

Hey 7 what part of canada you in?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Thanks The7, very interesting.... I am tracking 16 pairs with this but I only started last night, so only one that I could see so far. The candles start new at 3pm my time. This strategy could work out well for me as I also use candle patterns to spot opportunities’ sometimes ahead of the SMA cross, i.e. pin bar and engulfing etc.
Thanks again, Dave

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Added a couple more as the candles closed.
U/Ch went through the 5ema but not as a great signal to go short however its sitting below a big number and has a "sort of" pin bar.
N/U was a buy entry signal through the 5ema
G/CA was also a buy and sitting at a support area.
This is my twist on 7's nice and simple approach but I don’t want to compromise the intent of the thread, just let me know if it’s an issue.

Dear Professional.

will you be so kind enough to read what i am writing down here. I am really new in FX began some 8 months ago, i am wake up again after pooled by MC several times and i think i am trying now to be more tough. I like both system long trade and especially short, Scalping or what ever but I like to call it Rush Trade. I begging you to share me a very simple strategy both long and short together with indicators used.

I should thank you so much for your time and look forward to hearing from you or your professional FCC member.

Hug & best regards

DenOzi FX

--- 帖子 #583 ---
First of all thank you so much for the system. I have a question regarding the timezone. I am using metatrader platform with server time GMT-5

will that impact this strategy? Please advice.

Thanks in advance.

MC

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Time zone doesn't matter in regards to strategy.  You just have to know when your broker daily candle closes.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Thank you so much prosper1..It is very convinient in that case as candle starts at 16:00 my time.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Thanks to The7 for sharing his trading strategy.

It's amazing, especially if combined with some indies to confirm the entry.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I saw this engulfing candle that looked too good to be true as the most recent candle had already begun - I looked at it around 9 pm last night (the new candle starts for me @ 3pm), but I thought, what the heck so I bought 0.2 of a lot with a 100 pip SL that was to move to break-even plus 5 pips if it moved to plus 30 pips. When I got up this morning you can see the results - plus 150 pips. I closed the order and made my first coffee.

Denozi, this is a demo account, I am not ready to go live yet. I use The7 set-up (two 5ema's set high and low) and no other indicator’s. I like to draw S&R and use them as a "look out" zone. I look for some candle patterns.  I usually go with the trend unless there is one I can't resist - see attached. My FF name is fxscalp1 because when I started I too got a big rush out of scalping unfortunately for me it was mainly my hard earned money RUSHING out of my live account. I now only trade with daily time frame. Sorry about the long answer.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Nice work FXSCalp!  But that doesn't seem to be a set-up according to The7 system.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Your right prosper1, the candle touched both sides but I made the exception because it was an engulfing candle.  The7 mentioned in a previous post that it might be considered as a trade and that there are no fixed rules for the stratagy other than the ones a trader might use.  As I flip through the 18 pairs I have up, I look for the buy or sell signals based on 7's ema's, then I look for confirmation using a few candle patterns and S&R as confirmation.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Sorry - I have a cold, hope my thoughts make sense. I like the7's approach and want to keep it a simple and clean process that I can mould into a working system that I can use. I personally don’t like any indicators. When I first started fx a couple of years ago I got hung up on them to the point that I had charts with more indicators on them than a 747 !

--- 帖子 #591 ---
LOL. Yea I know what you mean. I 've made more pips using this system than any scalping I've ever tried.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Here is one I just put a sell order in for - we will see.............

--- 帖子 #593 ---
QUESTION FOR THE 7....also includes anyone who has noticed what I have too. Please give feedback.  7, I notice over the last few weeks,that yes, your system has been very profitable. Thanks for sharing it. But I see that your rule of insisting that the body of the candle must be outside the channel is costing many winning trades. In fact I see that if the tail or spike is the only thing going across the channel line, it has been very profitable as well. Why not let the tails or wick/spike count to qualify a trade?

#2-I find that if you enter a trade at lets sat 6pm, 1 hour after market reopens, the rules say to use the previous bar high or low as our stop. But I find that unless that bar is a good size, you are better of gong 2 bars back to use a little wider stop loss. Anyone agree? 7 what do you say?  -)

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Still bringing in the pips. I missed a few days, due to some PC issues, but The7

is back in the groove. Trades and trade management per Hopwood's EA, which

is working really well.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Funny, I still can't get Hopewood's EA to take any trades.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Yea I'm in also...

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Is your broker an ECN and do you have ECN = true? Have you turned off the swap filters?

hi rob

is the latest file you attached Hopewood's EA?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Valid signal, in on GU

I turned off swap filters, and criminal ECN=true.  Not sure if that will do it?

I am new to using EA's.  Would you be able to save your settings as a set file and send?

Thank you somuch "The7" for sharing this wonderful system..

MY GBPUSD chart..looks like it willhit my SL

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I would put my stop a few pips below the low of the previous bar, but thats just me. Everyone has a little different style.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi every mates,

I think it'd be better if we waited until today's candle closed below previous day candle's low.

Thanks The7

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Wow..finally bounced back..

My USDCAD hit SL.. rest 3 are in profits..

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Yes, me too on the U/CA  My SL also got hit after I had second guessed myself and re-adjusted it to just above the previous candle.  But you know, although it recovered, it could have gone the other way too and the ultimate idea is to profit from multipe orders, let the loosers go and stay with the winners- and it looks like you are right on track mrcool4

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Thank You Fxscalp..  I did a small mistake in placing SL for GBPUSD because of which booked in loss..Anyways I don't mind as this is just a demo account.Overall I am happy that system is working perfectly..

I am going to enter following positions on Monday opening..

AUDUSD Buy Signal

EURAUD Sell Signal

EURGBP Sell Signal

AUDCAD Buy Signal

If you don't mind keep sharing your trades as well so that we can track this system and also will be helpful for other members of this thread.

Hi Rob ... what about AUDUSD (buy), AUDCAD (buy) and EURAUD (sell) ?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
AUDUSD - I missed this one. Looks like a great setup with a nice pinbar.

AUDCAD - Touch and go. Wick barely inside channel, body outside of channel

EURAUD - Solid sell signal. Better, IMO, than the eurcad setup I posted.

I'm using Hopwood's EA, so it'll be interesting to see which pairs it ends up trading. It's definitely a lot

less maintenance than manual trading, but there is no discretion. Sometimes discretion can be a good

thing. I would be totally satisfied trading The7 manually, in which case I would use Hopwood's MPTM

to manage the trades.

EURAUD

EURGBP

AUDCAD are still open...

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Well here was a trade I have just closed at a loss. I had gone short on this yesterday when I shouldn’t have gone anywhere at all !  The red candle needed to have opened above the upper EMA.  Of course it might well recover and continue the downward trend but that is no excuse for holding on to a bad trade decision and in my experience the sooner I can get out of a bad trade decision - the better.  But heck - it was hard to pull the plug

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Here are the rest that are still open. In every case I have closed the orders from 0.2 of a lot to 0.1 so taking some profit and I have moved the break even to +5 when they were in a +30 pip profit. These orders will only be closed if 1) the SL is hit or 2) I see a reversal signal as per The7 strategy.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi there, greetings to all. I'm new in the forum and on trading also.

I follow these step, but i can not see the EA on "Expert advisor Explorer" after copy and rename the file to this folder.

http://screencast.com/t/pdx4SSv7

What I did wrong?

UPDATED!

I just solve the problem. Really is not a problem, really is that I installed only the .set file, but I had not installed de EA.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi Rob - I'm a bit confused: so you dont use any SL and TP ? Strange - acc. to the rules the SL is the high/low  of the last candle ?

--- 帖子 #629 ---
The SL and TP are programmed into Hopwood's EA, to follow the system as explained by the author. I let the EA stop-out per the code, but I use my own TP by the use of BE, etc.

Rob

--- 帖子 #630 ---
yes that's the point ! did  you ever had a loss by SL ? I'm running SH's EA today with your setfile - but 3 trades are open although the price is -for sells - far higher the upper line of the channel but the SL didnt work ...  the same for buys: the price is far under the buttom line of the channel but the trades arn't stopped out !

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Booked my EURAUD short for 30 pips.. I am holding only AUDCAD long.. EURGBP stopped out..

--- 帖子 #632 ---
YOUR TIME ZONE DOESNT MATTER! Guys, so many of you are asking about differences in time zone. You just look at your daily bar, which will close at 5pm New York Time. So whatever time that is in your country or state, thats when the bar is closed and a new one begins. You may start trading at that time. I like to wait 1 hour until 6 as they often widen the spreads on you that 1st hour so i wait till 6. Thats it. Nothing else to worry about. And if you are trading 60 mion bars or whatever, just use your own bar close you see on your screen. Finished! I hope that helps some of you. LOL

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I will give one more hint that will have everything covered that matters. What happens if you wait for the bar close but the daily bar is very small in size and you only have like 30-50 pips range and you feel you will get stopped out. So...no problem. Go back one more bar and use that as the stop loss. This should now cover every situation.   Oh, and in case it doesnt fix your problem, probably it means that you should just find another trade.

My mentor and teacher said to me "If you cant explain easily and confidently to a 12 or 14 year old why you want to take a certain trade, you probably shouldnt take it!"    Missing out is ok, it frees your time to find something youll be even happier with.  This tip was worth a fortune to me over the years and I will share it with you guys. After all, a candle doesnt go out by lighting another candle.

Ok, lets suppose you know what car you want to buy and you call up the dealer and he gives you a price. You don't trust him that much so you ask him to make you a promise that he will honor that price. He says ok. Now you feel better. So as you are driving down to the dealership, you are all excited about driving this new car with a nice look your neighbors will all say "Oh wow, very nice!"  But now you get to the dealership and guess what happened. They claim to have made a mistake and the car you want is still available, but in white, not black as you really wanted. But he offered you a nice price, you told him you want it and so you take it. You drive home with it...half of you is excited, but the other half of you wishes he would have went to another dealership. In other words, you aren't 100% happy with the trade. You traded your dollars for his metal vehicle.  Same with a trade. You are using Fibonacci numbers. Everything lines up, You were watching the trade for hours or days and all you need is for it to break up thru the .786  line and you are in and 100% happy. But, someone called you and kept you on the phone for an hour, you came back and price broke thru the .786 as you wanted to make you 100% happy. But the problem is, it is now 20 pips higher than you wanted to pay for it.(I hope you had a number in mind!) So what do you do, let this beautiful trade go, or take it and just suck it up that youll make 20 pips less? What do you do? I will tell you.................. DON'T GET INTO THAT POSITION THAT YOU HAVE TO EVEN ASK, because all of you who know Murphys law know, whatever you decide you will regret it. You cant always do it, but try to make trades that make you 100% happy getting in or at least follow 100% of your rules. Then if you lose, you don't lose your good mood too! LOL

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Great advice!!

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi Silat,

Thank you for the info. But my daily bar doesn't close at 5pm New York Time . A new daily bar is starting everyday at 12:00 AM canada time(Server time not my local timezone).

Anyways so far this system is working perfectly, I would like to continue with my setup and continue my demo testing.

Thanks,

MC

--- 帖子 #636 ---
You are 100% correct. I never needed a SL because all my trades were winners. Yesterday, I had two trades reverse and go beyond the SL and nothing happened. I ended up closing them out manually. I posted the problem

on Hopwood's forum, so hopefully there will be a fix. As always, make sure everthing is tested out on demo before

going live.

If there is no fix, I will enter all my trades manually and use MPTM to manage the trade.

Rob

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Good morning folks, (8am my time) Here are my latest results, 3 have hit my BE SL so far with one still open. I haven't got the order manager that I've borrowed, working quite right yet. My goal was to have all orders move to BE +5 at +30 pips and then close half the order. The BE moved to +5 as requested but I had to close off half of the orders when I awoke yesterday morning so as you can see the profits vary from order to order. Other than my bad trade decision on the eurusa I'm very pleased with this strategy - thanks again The 7.

Hello there!

It's the first time I'm gonna try this method. I'd like your opinion about the following pairs. Supposing that everything goes as it should, the signals seem valid. What do you think?

AUD/USD

EUR/CHF

GBP/AUD

GBP/NZD

NZD/CHF

Thank you,

Akis

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I wouldn't take any of those trades. Somewhere in this thread the7 mentioned that if the signal candle touches both EMA's it's invalid.  I believe this is the case for most of your pairs.  Beware of a long wick inside of EMA channel. This shows weakness as the price has already retreated in the opposite direction of your signal.

I am not taking any trades tonight. Still floating a loss from selling EUR/AUD on Sunday night from Friday's candle.  I have had good success with this system so far but I am very picky about which trades I take.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hello

Thank you The 7 for this very simple and yet profitable system. I have been trading for 4 yrs and this system suits me very much because of my life stlye and time constrain.

I hv been following this thread for more than 3 weeks and have implemented this strategy to my live trades. Previously, I was using other system in shorter tf of 1hr and the other system using 15m. The shorter tf need monitoring and have to be in front of my laptop most of the time. There were more trades executed compared to this system, but the philosophy in trading is when you have more trades it means you are also risking more loss.

To all newbie using this system please understand that this system is in daily TF. It means that whatever system using daily tf also require a high stop loss and a high tp. Most of the system in daily tf are using approximately 150pips of SL and 100-250pips of TP and execute only once or twice trade a week.

This system is considered unique and trader friendly as The 7 created a very minimum SL (based on high/low of previous candle)

an everage of about only 50-60pips. but the take profit is more than that. The R&R ratio is more than 1:1

I will not take any trade if the previous daily candle touches both sides of MA as it also have a big SL. As for TP, I would set according to cwp1979 parameters and the distance is not less than my SL.

It is not wisely to take profit at 30pips when you have 5 trades because if all the trades  goes against you, your account might blown out. If using EA for taking profits, I would set it to 50percent at 50pips and let the other 50pct running by moving SL to BE. To all newbie, please read all post especially from cwp1979  which is very important and please apply your trading strategy according to his advise.

If you require a very simple and very effective EA for monitoring your TP and SL, you may download 'THV CAVE MANAGER'

to be applied to your expert folder.

Hope it helps, thank you.

ps..thank you very much to cwp1979 for your great post, you have created the edge.

Hi Akis, thanks for posting your signals. It gives me and others a chance to see what we have missed and consider our own rules to this lovely simple system. I was busy yesterday and didn’t have a chance to look for signals, so please bear in mind that my comments are with the benefit of 23 hours of hindsight
aud/usa - looked good to me
eur/chf - horrible chart from my broker and also shows no signal
gbp/aud - no signal
gpb/nzd - no signal and not one I would trade as my brokers spread is around 15 pips (excluding last # on price)
nzd/chf - I can’t find it on my demo system
Remember, brokers data feeds may vary - do vary, so it's just what I'm seeing. Keep posting your picks.

Dave.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I took few stupid trades which ended up in losses. I shouldn't have entered those trades but a lesson learnt again(Did this mistake quite a few times earlier).Decided strongly to enter trades which are with clear and right signals..

AUDUSD short-wrong call as bar touching both EMA's

NZUSD-Short signal but still in loss

USDCAD-Buy Signal but still in loss

EURUSD-short-wrong call as bar touching both EMA's (SL hit)

GBPUSD-Short signal (SL Hit)

Not a good day so far..

Cheers

--- 帖子 #645 ---
ChicagoRob and others,

Please take a look at the attached statement. I'm using the EA with the Settings sent by Rob lately. Big disappointing results.

Any comment?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
The7 method certainly seems to suit some pairs more than others.

I decided to look at 1 pair at a time and visually backtest The7 (red crosses and ticks) and also visually backtest the flying buddah (white crosses and ticks).

For me a fail/cross is if the price does not make the distance in pips from entrance to S/L, RR 1:1.

I know some of you take profit 50% at 30 pips and move 50% to BE so my charts wont apply to your way of trading.

To eliminate losses I only enter once price crosses the high/low of the signal candle with stop orders.

So far the best performer I have found is Aud/Cad and worst performers are Aud/Jpy and Usd/Cad.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Something isn't right because I'm not seeing any trades at the partial close setting.

Rob

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Rob, what could be the problem if I am using the same EA along with the same settings you posted.

Can I drive you crazier by asking you to put the EA and the Settings in one zip file and upload for us for the zillions time?

I am just trying eliminate all possible mishaps here or there.

Thanks Rob  ;-)

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Here are my picks with charts today;

Out of curiosity, that's quite a big SL compared to your TP? not very good RR - Why's that? Aren't the rules the h/l of the previous candle? Again, just curious - not having a dig or anything

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I am long in audusd and audcad..

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi iamboston yes your right about the SL.  I am using the Rokz order management EA which I have set the SL @ 70 pips with a partial order close at +30.  I'm still learning to use the EA as far as the settings go so this is more a test of the EA for me and I want to see how it plays out.  Also, this is a demo account.

Dave.

NOTES FROM A PRO SYSTEM TESTER:

Gentlemen, I would love for us all to get on the same page here. I have tested more systems and even mental strategies than most of us have hair on their head. We seem to have confusion just on how this system is supposed to be implemented. If I am wrong, then my way is very profitable anyway, and I will share it with you. This is the only way you can play this without it being a different system altogether.

Lets use a short trade as a rule: 1 or most often several green candles take us up and thru the top band. The very next bar closes with part of its body inside the top band and part of its body outside the band. The top band!.This means it will be a red bar. Since I am using daily bars only(I dont see it working on any other time frame yet) I will wait until 5pm est/ New York Time to consider the bar closed as that is the cutoff for that bar and a new day begins in the spot Forex market, and we can now enter short! But wait...look at the spreads. They are gigantic. Maybe I shouldnt jump in right away. So, let me wait until 6:30pm or even 7pm when the spread is at least as good as I get it during busy hours. Now we are short.

Stop loss: So now we use the previous candle to the first red candle or, the first red candle itself, whichever gives you the most room, and also more pip risk so we dont get stopped out by market makers tricks. The new bar formed 60 min ago is not even a bar yet to me in this calculation. Of course if the previous bar before the signal bar is too large to place your stop right above it, use the actual high of the last bar, the one that gave you the signal.  So for me if todays high was 1.5925 and the previous bar(2 back) has a high of 1.6050, I probably dont want 125 pips of risk so I will take the last bar if high is lower. That's it. That is the only judgement you have in this system! I have only backtested the previous bars high not last bar close high, but Im pretty sure both are profitable.

Targets and take profit area: THERE IS NONE. This is not a get out at end of day system. You have no idea how much profit you can make. None. That is the secret of why this works. You know exactly how much you can lose, but God only knows how big your profit can be. That's why with daily bars you want to be in during big news events. Because you are either going to lose 50-80 pips or so, or make possibly hundreds of pips. Do not be afraid of news if already in the trade.

Setting profits to break even: NEVER! You will be taken out as soon as you pass the previous days bar high. Your profits wont disappear. Leave the trade alone. There is nothing more for you to do until you are bounced out of the trade. Just  dont forget to keep resetting your stop at 1 pip or 1 tick above todays closing bars high. THATS IT. That is the whole system.

ENCLOSED IS TONIGHTS ONLY TRADE I SAW THAT WOULD BE A VALID ENTRY. GBP/USD short. This trade is actually a perfect entry. #1-The body is pirced by the upper band, not just the tail. (Taking trades where the tail or wick is whats going thru the band are lower percentage. I do not usually take them but that is only my personal opinion. I like clear picture perfect charts a 6 year old would not hesitate over, or else I move on to the next pair. The next reason I love this entry is also personal. Look at the blue line to the left of the chart. That is where all the action was. It is the area all the big money on BOTH sides fought over. I like that. It tells me that it just may be an "attractor" area once again. So since we have no resistance in the way, getting back down there is not impossible. Maybe without a stop out. Maybe with one stop. Also we have had clear waves to show us this pair likes to move in waves steps or clusters. Exactly what we need to win! We are not here to guess, just follow the rules. =)

I share all this with you because what I need, what we all need are teams to step up and provide info which I see 2 of you already did. Thank you both! -) Here is what we need:

1-What 2 or 3 pairs worked out best that week, and for the entire month. Same for which 2 or 3 pairs worked the worst.

2-If you have had an extended move with 2 or more bars not even touching a band, is it profitable to take the reversal when clearly the trend is the other way? Is it even more profitable!!!!?

3-What happens if you get stopped out 2 times in a row on one particular pair, is this pair getting tired or erratic and now is unplayable for a month?

4-There may come a time this system doesnt work. What one, just one!.........change can we make, like adding an indicator or getting in on the bar "after" the trigger bar, or.....getting in when it looks like the next bar will trigger entry but we get in either one bar before at close or even before close.

5*** Might be most important: Was this pair up or down in this same month for the last 3 years? 5 or more years would be even better info. I hope someone will keep these stats fopr the team. One person volunteering for each pair will give us the stats every month.

THESE SCENARIOS AND RULES ARE NOT PART OF THIS SYSTEM. DON'T USE THEM! BUT WE SHOULD KNOW THEM AND EVERYONE IS FREE TO ADD JUST ONE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE,IF THIS SYSTEM FAILS AT SOME POINT.  Have I cleared up any questions on the way to really use this system to get the most bang for your buck and what the inventor was conveying?

WHAT THIS THREAD HAS TOO MUCH OF AND DONT NEED: We dont need questions that are already answered in the first post. No comments about adding different things and using indicators. Thats not part of this system.....for now. We dont need anything but charts like I just showed you which help us to know when to get in and out. We arent concerned  that your mother will make you move out if this system doesnt turn around soon. We dont care that someone broke into your car and stole your weed. We dont care that your girlfriend couldnt care less about your trading.(Neither does mine and its a bummer. lol)  And we definitely arent interested in any of your past battles that cant help us make more money. EVERY POST YOU MAKE SHOULD HELP US SMILE OR LAUGH OR MAKE MORE MONEY. Everything else is just clutter. Sorry guys, but I can be crazy and silly with the best of them,but after 15 years of being on threads, I have no time for anything but money making ideas. Who is with me on this??????? Anyway, I hope this post is clear enough not one more person will ask "What are the rules again, please?"  Now lets go kick this GBP's behind and watch it crash and burn!

Silat50, someone broke into my car and stole my weed! j/k  I just did my nightly analysis for possible trades and also came up with GBP/USD short as my only trade tonight. We must be on the same page. One thing I wanted to point out is to be wary of trading correlations.  For example, tonight I see potential trades in GBP/USD short and GBP/AUD short; however, if I take both trades I am essentially doubling my bet on GBP declining.  I prefer to look at the charts and take the pair with the strongest trend and nicest risk/reward. This is why I decided on GBP/USD.

Wow, another loser this week.  Figures that I was hitting about 80% winners demo trading and now am 1 for 4 with real money. Lost about 100 pips this week.

Look up the meaning of comprehensive, and then try posting a coherent statement. That is, if you're not too busy looking for someone else's weed.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi Walad,

It's only two day's trading results. Have you continued on? If so can you post further statement?

I believe we need to look at at least a month's forward run to evaluate the system properly.

to be honest, i dont have a clue what your point is here ?? or what you are asking.

it appears after 15yrs of being on forexfactory, you brain has gone bonkers. no disrespect.

iam surprised you are still around.

I am sorry you cannot read nor comprehend the first post by The7! .....Maybe, some 8 year old could help you learn to read. Hooked on reading phonic's ? Better yet, maybe all the traders can chip in for you for a basic course. They could walk you through and hold your hand.... A price close above and below the 5 ema on the daily with 1 day stoploss and no take profit is so hard to understand. Maybe, the website infant pips should be started!

Hello All,

How come this thread has become inactive suddenly..Is any1 here following this strategy?

How many of you entered USDJPY short?

Cheers,

Hi MC, here are the three I have open.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
I looked at this one to but my rules said to hold on because it was too close to a support line and the reversal was not a good pin bar. Just my way of trading so take it for what its worth.  I'm probably not going to post any more charts as I seem to be one of the few that bothers to and  I truly believe that a picture says a thousand words.  Alyway, make lots of pips and thanks again The7 for starting this thread.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I am sorry for not posting the charts dave. Thank you for sharing your picks..

--- 帖子 #670 ---
No mention of Targets (?) and Stops (?), so it is real hard to generate any mathematical probability for use in a risk model upon back-testing.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hello The7,

Where do you set your Stops and your Limits?  How do you know the probabilistic risk/reward ratio?  Where you aware that "trends" don't really exist from the trader's perspective and that the continuance of price momentum in any lower time-frame is only possible when price momentum is being extended in a larger time-frame (which is what most people call the "trend")?

Also, a "trading system" is the algorithmic integration of multiple autonomous and independent functions (or modules) into an extensible and cohesive whole unit, which produces a trade signal containing a specific range of characteristics used to produce revenue from the continuance of the market in one direction or the other.  Can you please identify the working functions of The7 Trading System?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Please go through complete thread once again..SL and TGT were mentioned earlier by The7

--- 帖子 #673 ---
If you know where this information was discussed, can you please give a Post Number?  I've already read the OP and it does not contain the Stop and Limit levels, so I can easily expedite the information by going directly to the post # containing that information without reading through dozens of posts that don't.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
It must be me, who is rather dumb - a highly sophisticated person like you would not miss the information contained in your very own post 672 - especially citation! Thank you for your repeatingly kind, caring and inspiring posts.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
It just seemed like common sense to me - but I guess I'm being ignored.  Without knowing what my risk ratios look like, I can't define a trade - let alone actually make one.

One can look at the strategy (I don't see a "system" of trading here) and figure out that the "signal" comes from a fairly typical In Channel One Bar Reversal Pattern either above or below the Low or High moving average.  It will not work in a horizontal market.  It also will not work in a directional market having repeated strong corrections that don't move price outside the moving average of either the High or the Low.  So, you will catch the first impulse move that initiates a directional market in that case, but most revenue you collect will get wiped away with all the subordinate corrections that take place down range (into the future).

You'll have to do the homework and find which Stop/Limit levels work best for your needs and hope that over time there is sufficient equity growth without too much draw down over the same period.  Anyway....

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hello there!

It's the first time I'm gonna try this method. I'd like your opinion  about the following pairs. Supposing that everything goes as it should,  the signals seem valid. What do you think?

AUD/USD

EUR/CHF

GBP/AUD

GBP/NZD

NZD/CHF

Thank you

Please mention long or short positions that would make things easy for us as the charts are different based on brokers.

All of your blithering is useless to me as I code the EA and post it for public use. You were right in saying that Post 1 is not comprehensive--because other conditions were added in subsequent posts and subsequent pages. Ironically, you will probably be the first to piss and whine that something like pinbars or candle spans are not addressed in the EA.

By the way, there is no apostrophe in phonics but this doesn't matter. Obviously, you are a genius for naming yourself after a weasel.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Thanks to The7 for sharing his trading strategy.

It's amazing. I  this entry strategy nice The 7

--- 帖子 #682 ---
The7...Are you out there?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
CWP, yes we are on the same page if we came up with the same one play. Sadly the sucker lost. -)  Everyone got so excited when "Seven" introduced the system and everything it touched turned to gold. I mean I saw 2 or 3 pairs up like 1000 pips in a week and everyone wanted in. Now that volume has decreased, its taking longer for a trade to play out, that must have a lot to do with our win % going lower.

Also some of you talk about not taking similar correlated pairs. Might be true, might not. Look at the GBP/JPN but then lok at the GBP/USD. No correlation at all and jpy and usd always move together. Guess not! Also, why isnt CAD and AUD moving together.  Many of us including me got bumped out of several trades because of a stupid 20 or 30 dollar drop on gold. In a normal world traders would figure out that when something is overpriced as is gold, making it lower is often GOOD for the economy of that country. But these are not normal times. This system is to be used without any fundamental analysis at all. I'm sure ALL of us messed up on that. =)

Also, I still happen to be winning. This was just a terrible week for the system.  I will repeat this again...this system WILL work. If it does not.........THEN AND ONLY then will we need to add a rule or 2, maybe fibs or not taking trades where there is support or resistance in the way. We can also not take trades where the charts are messy and have no patterns. But for now..."just play the song."  And who cares if the 7 is out there. He might be making so much more than he thought, and getting barraged with so many more doubters than he thought, he just walked away. Yea...I think some of you made "Elvis leave the building." We are on our own,it seems. So what?

Oh, one guy posted 3 different scenarios this system wont work in. Well, what system wil work well in those 3 scenarios!!!? However I still say it will work. Have any pair go up 5 days in a row and then down 5 days in a row and every month winds up in the same place, I dont know aboput you guys, but I will be rich. If you cant get this simple system to work, hopefully by itself, and maybe with adding in some fibs or support and resistance rules, honestly...trading isn't for you. This is the greatest gift ever offered on Forex Factory to me. It is so simple Im surprised I didnt invent it myself. I think we were all too busy thinking of bollinger bands and they DONT work by themselves. But you guys who must mess with this, why not setting up each chart with bollinger bands as well everytime a signal goes off on this system and tell us what you see. I have a few other ideas to implement if this system gets gnarly. Im just here because I need a system tester for both my rules and to keep abreast of his new rules. Im always open to new things! Good luck boys. And root me in on this long USD/CAD trade I have 17 pips in the bag in 30 minutes already.

Oh, I will give you guys one more thing you guys are probably flipping out on. What do you do when ther reversal bar doesnt just close thru one bar, it goes all the way thru the second bar too? Bet most of you go crazy,right? Do you take the trade, or no?  And to the guy whose "weed" was stolen out of his car, Im just happy for you that your car was still there. LOL

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Thanks for the encouragement CWP. And for you Mr Cool, I would love it if  my daILY BAR CLOSED AT midnight on my time. It would be perfect.  It is totally dead at 5pm here on NY time. In fact I have a great idea, if they would start the  new actual day(and daily bar) at 12 midnight when you can have Asia in Full swing, London would get in a bit earlier and we retail traders would have plenty of action and could go to bed at a reasonable hour instead of staying up till 4am every day here in the states! This one idea if someone could get it implemented would add 25% more volume to this dying Forex machine.  And Mr Cool, so tell us if you are still profitable or not. You had to get hammered like most of us these past 4-7 trading days.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Yes, This system has worked so far for me.  Made more pips live than anything alse I've tried.

You just have to stick with it. The winning weeks do make up and more for the losers, even with a week like

this it didn't fare all that bad for me.

Funny how people say it doesn't work?  I wonder how long have they actually traded it live to be able to know that?

Every sytem has drawdown periods.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
here is a hint:   the seven ...:where is the Exit?"

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Are you still closing half at 30 pips and not moving the other half to BE?

Exiting on reverse signal?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Actually I am only trading 1 lot and taking 30-40 pips each trade. Sometimes a little more , depending

on the set-up.  You can take much more profit with a 2nd lot and that's what I plan to do soon, but just wanted to

test the entries first.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I'm trying something new, which is to trade 23 charts on M30. It'll be too

hard to trade manually, due to the high turnover. I'll use The7 EA with a

hard stop and BE.

I'll post the results, good, bad, and ugly.

Rob

--- 帖子 #690 ---
The only pairs that are almost independent are EURUSD and USDJPY. Any other pair will statistically correlate to one of them. Hence, it is not wise to just trade the 23 pairs as you will see that the EA opens 6-7 positions at the same time.

Anyhow, can't wait to hear from you Rob.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
There may be some correlation going on, but in many cases the actual chart

entries can be quite different.

Rob

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Yes Silat.. you are correct got hammered last week..

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Walad, you cant convince me that the aud/cad and eur/gbp would have any correllation at all. Especially the aussie, and the aussie against most of the pairs its hooked with. Rob, lets prove him wrong. Just for the profit and fun of it. LOL    I could be wrong. It would be the 2nd time. LOL

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Well, my M30 experiment is not doing well. It trades like crazy, since there are new setups

every half hour. It started out well, but I'm seeing a lot of SL trades. I'll post charts & graphs

after a few more days.

I also think the lower time frame is at a disadvantage, due to the effect of the spread. Nothing

ventured, nothing gained.

Rob

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I had a similar experience once with the M30, which conforms with manual back testing also.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Good observation,Rob. I was going to mention it but wanted you to see for yourself for proof. I think we all should just stick to the daily time frames as they are easiest and the spread doesnt matter much. Plus we get bonuses...use the daily and we have the weekly to show us support and resistance areas yuh cant see on the daily,plus then when you gow down to the 4hr you can get good confirmation on the pattern. So all 3 time frames support each other, much better than say a 5-15-60m would do.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
OH YEAH, I tried using the 60m and 240m to trade but there is way too much chop and they dont work with these 5ema bands well. Bet yuh need different bands so why not just stick with daily bars as we were told in the 1st place. -)

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi guys,

I read the thread and decide to use this system.Here is my first trade. Is it right or wrong?

please share your comments. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #701 ---
As per the rules, the wick is quite tall in the direction of the trade and recommended not to trade them. Better to wait for another good setup.  But there is a very high possibility of this buy trade moving in positive direction but not based on this system's rules.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
thank you psjforex. you are right i forgot to look at wick.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I would have taken the trade. You did good Vendetta. The pattern looks like its bottoming out anyway. And where did it say not to use candles with big wicks? I am going to review the rules again. But anyway, Ive been doing fine taking the trade as long as the body no matter how big or small is laying acrross that lower band for a long. does anyone go long if the bar is a big engulfing bar and crosses both bands? The system doesnt say not to and so I do. In fact from personal experience, A big engulfing bar that is almost all body are one of the surest reversal signs you can see,short term. I know guys who make a living just trading those bars in stocks.

And not to make fun of the guy who was pointing out what climates this wont work in, I think non directional and choppy markets will always be much harder for any system. One good thing you can do is, if you get stopped out on 3 consecutive days in a row. You can always quit for the week. Im still up on this system although, the challenging environment has taken about 1/2 back already. Most other systems would have crushed your whole account. What I love about this system is 4 or 5 losers in a row and its not too bad. You can get it back in one winning trade. Im also finding out that getting in after small prior bars is not a "good deal as I thought with little risk. Its the highest percentage of losers by far. I like bars that have a lot of pips at risk because even if you dont win the trade,time will be your friend as the longer you are in the trade, the smaller that stop gets as you keep moving it with each bar.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Thank you Silat50.

I took profit yesterday. I know strategy says to wait until opposite signal but its not fit my personality.

This is my new trade :

--- 帖子 #705 ---
[quote=VendETTA;6271767]Thank you Silat50.

Since the head of this thread seems to have left, maybe I can help. I have made a few changes to keep out the bad trades and so far it is working for me. This system is too valuable to throw away just because it doesn't work by itself.You all saw how well it did in the beginning which is how we got all these subscribers here.

#1-If the bar/candle crosses both bands, take the trade! These engulfing type bars are one of the best indicators a trend change is underway. If you cant afford the pip risk,just take 50% minimum of the candle. 75% or so its even much better. Me, I take it all. I don't mind having 130 pip risk because the chances of an opposite candle bigger than that one coming is very very small and each day we stay in the trade we move the stop closer and closer to break even anyway.

#2-Do not take trades opposite the bands direction if the angle or slope is very deep. You are getting in front of a moving train. Do nothing. PASS.  See the chart presented below and tell me if you all don't agree that this is the reason for a lot of our stop outs in the first day. Ok, I will show more later on.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi guys,

I have been following this thread for a couple of weeks now and read all the posts one by one

I have to thank The 7 for sharing this method. it was a refreshing thing to me

I have started to do a manual backtesting for myself which will include 5 years (between 2007 up to now) of EUR/USD. I would like to do the backtesting for 10 years of course but it is so time consuming and I am occupied most of the weekdays.

I have already finished the first year now but I will share the results after I finish all 5 years...

In the mean time I have been trading live in a demo account and took those 2 trades shown in the picture below. Did any one take them too?

I closed the first one at +146 pips when the opposite signal occured. And the other one is floating at +78 pips now  already moved the stop to BE+5.

could you please illustrate and point on the chart, as i dont see it.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
RJo,

Ignore the retard trolls

I'm building an EA for this as well, so maybe we can exchange some ideas.

It is the MM and exists that matter (oh well, for any other strategy as a matter of fact :-) )

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Silat,

Don't wanna be the rain on your parade, but obviously the more daring trades are the ones to yield the most profits by catching an early trend change.

The secret sauce is to take your entries, and just manage them right. MM & Exists is the key between success and failure.

While I don't trade this system specifically, been trading similar concept for over 3 years now. Nobody gives a shit about the slope angle and such. On a higher time frame you only experience pure macroeconomic movements of the price, so small technicalities like slope and MA crossovers have lesser importance.

Levels and candle action are key on higher TF's

Hope this helps anyone move from following to the teeth any new system up for grabs for free on FF :-)

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Hello Everyone,

Two questions regarding this system. Doing it manually.

Entry: How are you entering the trade off of the close or high/low of the signal candle? or just leaving up to your own perference.

Now are you letting the trades run to the following week or finding better results to close trades before the weekend?

Thanks

If this was already answered sorry for asking again. aftyer reading 48 pages im lucky i know my own name, lol

Thanks

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I enter at the close of the signal bar, so you have to know when your broker candle closes.

I will let trades run into the weekend if looking good. I take 1 lot out at 30 or so pips and the theory is to let the rest run until opposite signal

or logical S/R area

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Thanks for the insight.

Also any luck on lower time frames?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I tried it on M30. Total waste of time. Lots of losers and very few winners.

Rob

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thanks

I was thinking maybe 4hr, or 1hr timeframes. I could see alot of false signals on anything lower than hour. The logic of it seems sound its just trying to incorporate other indies to help with decision process.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Don't know if this was posted yet , but here is the new EA for The7 strategy now re-named The8,

and it is an improvment and bug fix from the 1st EA.  Running it now on 10 pairs, we''ll see how it does.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Sorry if I missed something but I could not make this EA work.

I put it in the indicators folder and restarted MT4. selected the EA from the custom indicators droplist but nothing happened.

Am I doing something wrong?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Yes, you are doing wrong. Put it in the Expert folder, not in the indicator folder. EA means Expert Adviser.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Thanks dude, some expert advisors work like indicators, I thought that this is something like that. I was not looking for an automated trading EA

So may be a little explanation: this EA automatically buys/sells for you according to the rules defined in its script

[quote=Silat50;6280913]
ARE YOU ALL MAKING A BUNDLE THIS WEEK?  After the advice I gave all of you, and the market action of 4 and 5 up or down days in a row, on most pairs and with the bars being big enguphing bars, how could any of you not made back all you lost in the last month? I wasnt here for my health, but if the market goes sideways in this fashin, 5 days up and then 6 days down all season,I will be a rich man in a couple of years. What you guys are doing I dont know. But share with us anyway, Maybe we can make the system even better since so many of you seem to have lost heart!

One thing I never understood is how to GET THE MOST OUT OF using the MT4 EXPERT ADVISORS. HECK, 33% of the people here dont even know what they are and are afraid to ask. I myself dont know how to program them and that should have been easy standard info to get,especially on this entire website! LOL

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Paul, read my post on I think around 704 and that will help you. Yes the system says to wait for bar close. I will since you are a question asker,I like that, I will tell you a variation I am so far(about 10 days) doing very,very well with. I follow the system and set the stop at the high or low of the previous bars close when the market opens up, but if good news comes out or I feel the pattern is very strong I will put a second position in with the stop right under/over the current moving daily bar. It makes for a lot more excitement and will help you learn to read charts better. But.............you better know what you are doing before trying it. I only do it if I have 35 pips or less to lose on the 2nd position. You'd have to be crazy to get in on a big bar thats still in motion on the daily. And yes it appears that only the daily bar(not even the 240m!) has any chance of working.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Thanks for your insight. I read some of your posts very helpful. I to trade NY time and use other indies to help with the decision process for entry. Also I go with pending order because I use the previous candles high or low as entry level. Looking for more of long term gain than short ones and sometimes you get that candle that sticks it to you. What indies do you use to help with the decision or do you strictly adhere to entry rule?

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Silat50, if you had to narrow down to 5-6 pairs to trade with this one, which ones would you choose?

--- 帖子 #725 ---

It seemed to be a very good trading system, but found too many false signals while looking at the chart. Is there any way to identify the false signals and avoid them?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I made 500.00 yesterday and all I do is only take trades where the signal candle is followed by one of the next three candles breaking the low of the signal candle if short or the high of the signal candle if long. I set my stops normally and I am making consistent money. Hope this helps. Let me know, msn

--- 帖子 #728 ---
So when you have a valid signal candle, you monitor the candles and take whichever one of the three breaks the low?

Rob

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Booked these 4 positions in profits.. Took a short position in GBPUSD and long in USDCHF on friday. Booked half in GBPUSD for 81pips..

This system is rocking...

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Great question Paul. Really the only logical NEXT question you could ask. Sharp guy!  Ok, since I also use a harmonic pattern system, I will play heavier $$$ if my bat,butterfly or crab pattern also likes the trade in the same direction. I am also experimenting with 2 moving averages, the 70 and the 12 to see how it could help me stay in a trade longer,because as you know when we exit a short, very often the sucker is really just taking a bbreather and is building up steam for the big move but we have to exit on a break of the previous days high. Im trying to use the 70/12 to change that. Just experimenting on paper now. This system im using for real money,though.

I think i told you: MY modification better than any indicator I ever saw is:   learning how each system you try might require different money mgmt. Read that again.....very important.  So to re-iterate, what is making up for the system taking us out too early is  that when i get in I wait till the asian session is at least moving a bit and thats about 7pm est. So Im really giving the market a chance to digest any crazy news and see with my oqwn eyes what the asians are thinking at the open. Usually they are soooo slow to act its nothing!  lol     So now Its 7pm tuesday,lets say for example. I then place my stop either 1 full pip or 1/10th of a pip over the previous days high(monday). but now I watch the mkts till 8:30 and if I like what I see, I will place another lot over the high of the current bar. And you know why this works well? Oh man, you will love this!

It works well in my hands anyway, becaUSE WHEN THE NEWS COMES OUT MUCH LATER WHEN HOPEFULLY iM SLEEPING....news on the pair im in can really only work for me in a big way, but never against me by morer than 20 pips.Often seven or 8 pips on the second current bar!!!

why? let say im short the gbp/usd. Now bad news comes out for the gbp, I make double the amount as the system would make by itself,right? ok, follow me now.................. but if the news is bad I am only going to lose maybe 15-20 pips more because the 2nd bars high is so tiny. so  this is a great system to use on big news days. when you know the market is going to rip one way or the other. You can just add (usually its only about 15-20 pips avg) the few extra pips onto your loss and count it as one loss but if you win, you get twice the bang for the buck. Sounds too simple but it works. and  sometimes if i get stopped out on the small one before news, i may jump in again 5-10 min before the news but now i only give todays bar a 20 pip automatic stop loss no matter how big it might be. and if its only moved 8 or 9 pips,then thats all my risk is!!!!! People are afraid of news. I love news because with tight stops you can always jump back in 2 or 3 times when you have the experiencve to know they are faking you out. I can expain more on how to tell by previous few hours price action how to tell. Hopefully its moving sideways, which if you notice....lately most pairs dont do anything but go sideways before news. thos e big jumps by the rich gamblers are disappearing most times. notice that?

News events should make you the most money as long as you go in not caring which way they go. Invent a system like that and you will be rich....fast!

Rob, why not use my method and take BOTH the current candle ANDthe previous days candle by like 7-7:30 when the risk  for another position is tiny because the candle likely current daily candle probably only moved 8-20 pips anyway so early. Its almost like 2 for the price of 1 and a 1/4!!!!! Especially if news is coming you have double the exposure but only 1/4 (or less) more risk! Its awesome.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
yes thats correct but only for the following three candles, after that it seems less reliable.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Upon reviewing my charts, I see four yen pairs with setups(one spans both EMAs, but I like it anyway). Since the charts show very similar price action, I'm thinking of just running one yen pair to streamline the process. I'm also thinking of using the pair with the biggest average daily range and lowest spread.

What are your thoughts on this?

Rob

this will be a disaster in the long run. i can show you many occasions when the signal candle low / high was broken , if entered you would be stopped out (market reversed in the opposite direction). too many of these false trades. its not reliable. be very careful..

Sorry guys been floating between here and Hopwoods website.

First of all have a Happy New Year!

Now I maybe punch drunk from all of the holiday celebrating. What if instead of trying to formulate a ea for this system in which we all have different opinions and are worth exploring. How about creating a EA to take over the trade after we setup up our own entries. Such as a money management system, trailing stops, martigale type system ( I know just example. Kinda like it as long as you watch it), etc. That way we are comfortable with our own trading styles and then the ea wont put us in trades we dont like or would not of taken.

Just a thought. anyway enjoy the New Year!

3 candles is more than enough to get rich on ,especially if you are adding on the present candle and using its low(for a long play) as a stop!  I have had the most incredible run doing things that way, especially anything against the JPY!   Anyone who didnt profit with this system these last 3 weeks ,its not for you.

To re-iterate: You plan to get in on open of next candle when it breaks band. When the next candle comes the next day, by 9 or 10pm the market drops dead and it isnt going anywhere till the London boys come in around 1 or 2am. Maybe 3am. So if this present day candle is only about 15-30 or so pips,either against you or with you, take a second entry,(you must double the amount not cut it in half....cheapskates! LOL ) on the smaller bar,it must be much smaller or no more than another 15-30 pips of risk and now yopu are getting 2-1 for your money from that point on, with only a max extra risk of 30 pips! ****Then you pray for news to come out. It goes abainst you, big deal you lost 30 pips more, but if it goes WITH you....jeez, you know it might carry that pair for 2 or 3 days on that news. I LOVE NEWS WITH THIS SYSTEM. NEVER GET OUT WITH PENDING NEWS! NOT UNLESS ITS A HUGE WINNER ALREADY,THEN BRING YOUR STOP UP TO THE HRLY OR 4 HOUR BARS LOW/HIGH.Thank me "next Christmas.

I will give you guys a late Christmas present now. If I have 2 or 3 pairs to choose from I will leave out the pair on a long play where both bands are still pointing down. On any play I prefer at least one band to be going my way which makes it a four star play but if both are flat, thats still 3 stars, and if both bands go in different directions thats 2 stars.

DONT GO AGAINST 2 BANDS GOING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAN WHAT YOU WANT TO PLAY!

Now...would someone keep track of how well that would  work out as a continuation play, as another system, if we only got in when both bands turned in our favor and we still used the low of previous days candle to get out. Id sooner do that,than go against TWO bands!!!  This should help you guys a lot. Save a loooot of losers. Add to that my adding on the current bar which better not be bigger than the preceding bar and youll make bucks.

Also, you guys talk about 3 candles....do you know what daytraders using what???...say 5 or 15 or 30 min bars. How many times did they get in and out on that same pair you have,in one day. 3,4,5,6 times??? And you are just kicking back relaxing. Not giving all that "spread" away.  Daily bars no matter what system you use, 90% of the time are the winning-est time frame without rediculous risk of weekly frames.

And if you want to make a 3 day system out of it(which I dont!)  PM me and I will tell you the perfect method of getting out early) Yes I back tested it.) Best way is to use my system of adding to present candle to give you 2 entries and exits and leave it alone till you get stopped out of both stops. 3 days? You guys see these JPY pairs? I caught some that went 9 or 10 days! iF YOU ARE WORRIED, TAKE HALF OFF AFTER 3 FULL DAYS OF PROFIT, AND LET  THE REST RIDE. THEN let all the scalpers try to take that away from you. Good Fing luck to em! My mortgage gets paid on this, almost. The scalpers aint taking my money.

Wanted to just chime in and say thanks to the OP and the numerous contributors in this thread. Been entertaining and informative to watch. Thanks again, Happy New Year everyone.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Cant believe some of the negativity on this thread. If you think your previous day high or low will get taken out so easily...this isnt the system for you. Truly. As for me, if I take a trade, I prefer to take it  without changing the  system but not indescriminately either.

#1-The best setup is after 6 or more bars going one way, obviously would register as overbought/oversold on any oscillator like RSI, stochs, MACD, etc......and then it reverses with a big solid engulphing bar where 90% or more of the bar is in the direction you want! The chances of you getting stopped out the next day are the chances of (seriously) picking up 2 gorgeous women in the same hour. Its going to be rare!  Plus with a big bar, it aint getting you stopped out but maybe 15% of the time ...at most!

2-The next best set up is where you had a doji candle at the last days bar, after several candles the other way. Also way over/under sold or bought. THEN place the stop using the next previous candle so when the market opens you have your stop under/over candle #3!  Thats a lot of candles even if pips are only 50-60 for one days action to take out.

****IN OTHER WORDS, GET IN WHEN THE DAILY TREND HAS BEEN SUPER STRONG AND YOUD NEVER THINK OF GETTING IN WITHOUT THIS SYSTEM.

3-Getting in on news..............If big news is coming out on ypour pair later that night, you want a small -medium size candle behind you for the stop so you dont get hurt by the news. In this case if its a huge candle you must use, just place your stop at about 55-60% of the candle so you still would need a retrace of over half of a lets say 130 pip move. If the news goes your way which the candle is saying insiders already have an idea, you dont need the full candle risk. If the news is opposite the previous candle, why lose the whole 90-140 pips? But if you are alive after the nights trading you immediately go back to placing the stop at the top/bottom of that days candle....unless its even bigger!!!!....then you can use the 55-60% again also on that candle, and maybe take a second position after the market is open 2 or 3 hours on the small current candle. This requires expert money mgmt.

I cant believe all of you with the 6-12 candle swings weve had lately especially on CHF and also JPY pairs........ that you all arent flush with cash! These last 2 weeks were the best of my career in  a long time. And since I know how to handle it, if I got stopped out after 3 or 4 days run and the candle comes back inside the band, id re-enter with a 20-30 pip stop loss from the point of the high of the current candle if thats what stopped me out. Or I will wait for next day and if it closes back inside i will put the 30 pips back up as close to the top/bottom as I can of previous session. what a great system this is. But dont do all this playing games till you are really winning every week.

I may start moderating a trading room if a few of you want to set up a room for me to moderate. Let me know. There are "other ways to manage the trade once you added 2 more times to the trade so you dont get out all at once and get thrown off of a huge trend.

I REPEAT:  This system is good enough by itself especially if you dont get in until my conditions of a doji or engulphing bar are met after a big swing. I cant see how one can lose.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Silat50, Some pics of your set-ups and trades to go along with your explanations would be greatespecially for us visual learners.Thanks Much!

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Ask and ye shall receive,Prosper. Lets examine the chart:

1-The perfect place to enter was on the next trading day/candle(1 hour wait) after that Doji candle, 2 bars 2 the left of the green arrow. Not only did you have 10 bars going down/opposite to totally exhaust the trend, but the  hammer on left side of Doji gave confirmation 1st before you got the Doji for 2nd confirm! This is actually the most perfect setup for this system, possible. So we enter at around 9477,the open of the next bar and we get another and 3rd confirm as bar isnt that big but its solid and shows us there were only buyers. The sellers ran out of currency over 10 days of non stop dumping! So we close at 9517 for a 40 pip profit for day one...and much more important, we are ready for a rocket ship to take off. So the system tells us to do nothing and get out when we even go under(not close) the candles low to the left of us.

2-The semi advanced turbo technique-Why not get in for a second position after the last candle on the chart goes up about 20 pips? I did. Why?  #1-If you use a 30 pip stop, youd have to retrace all 20 pips gained in the Asian session and also go 10 pips into the previous bar as well. You will get stopped out over half the time, but you are risking 30 pips now to make double the gain on this run. Please!!!!....Give me any system on earth where I can make 150- 200 pips or more on each win and lose only 30 on each loss with even a 2-1 shot aagainst me. I will be very rich.

These confirmations are not nearly as powerful with just a 3 or 4 normal bar drop. Yet I will take it anyway. Why: If the reversal bar is a huge 120 pip enguphing, I already told you I would gladly take 120 pips of risk on the 10-15% chance I get knocked out on that candle and lose all 120 pips. Better chance to have Halle Berry lick your _____ ! But if we only get a doji or small bar similar to it,we get set up for a 2 bar entry in most cases. Sometimes we can go under the low of both bars if they are not big!!!!

EVERYTHING TO GAIN, NOTHING TO LOSE.   Ohhhhhh and look, that doji gave the bands time to straighten out and go in the right direction,so when we get in, both  the bands, the system and the candle setup is with us along with a possibility to make double.

There are even 2 more entries I can take to have 3 or 4 lots in, but this is way too much for now. I would stick to using 1 lot and play the 2nd lot on paper till you are profitable with it. And yes, all those different lines are moving averages from 2 other systems entirely! Dont even worry about them.  Lets kick some butt this month boys. Im very optimistic. Why?

Either we are going to continue the reversal we just got on all these new positions or...we get knocked out on a retrace for 2-5 days and we resume the original trend for another big move. Percentages do not point to choppy trading this month. Always........."look to the left. look to the left..............look to the left. Then you know what to expect. Still not sure, go to a weekly chart and look to the left. Still not sure, go to an hourly chart and ....look to the left. That comes later

--- 帖子 #741 ---
To simplify: I like to get in on my second lot when Ive gotten in already and the current bar has already gone up 30 pips so I place that stop under the present bars low which didnt exist 2 hours before! Much better is to wait for LONDON sESSION AS THE VOLUME IS MUCH HIGHER TO MOVE SOMETHING 30 PIPS. EITHER WAY IS A WINNING MOVE........

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Silat50 i agree with alot of what you have said. You have alot of insight. Question regarding with the doji candles dont you need confirmation from the close of the present before entry. Cant dojis act as a continuation of trend sort of a breather so to speak. Unless its like a pin type then i can see entering the trade.

Thanks,

Paul

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Thanks Silat50,Great info!!!  Keep it coming

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Would be helpful also if anyone is seeing a potential nice set-up to call them out.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Definitely paul. Dojis can act as continuatin/breather candles. But then they do no one from either side of the trade ANY good. Its when you have  many candles dropping and then the doji appears, its much more likely to be a reversal candle. And yes, you are right, we wait for the next candle "after" the doji to start for us to enter. But that doji coulnt be more than 40 pips of risk, right? So you can put  your initial stop under thye doji after it closes, and then if the pair takes off by 30 or more pips you take a second entry if you want under that current candle. Or put the second entry under the dOJI IF YOU WANT!  Or......go backwards not forward. You can put the 2nd entry under the candle left of the doji if the risk isnt that much greater if you dont like the doji. Or...you can wait one bar to close after the doji and get in under that one!

Just be consistant. The rest you can papertrade. So now you have the "7 SYSTEM" and 3 new entries to really "F*&k things up good!  =)     In the beginning when I had little free time, I just used the simple 1 entry system we were taught as I didnt have time to do all this debating and decision making. I would spend 15 minutes going over every pair. After I had 5 pairs in action I would only look to see hwere to move my stop to.

AND OH YES....ON DOJI'S and other small bars, or anything that sets an alarm off in your heard, YOU CAN WAIT FOR THE NEXT BAR TO GET IN, AND FORGET THE FIRST. I confess I came up with this by screwing up .I didnt see the trade sometimes and caught it on the second day into the band. Well, if it wasnt too much movement, Id take it right there. So many ways to win with this!  Im sorry for you newbies that Im making this into a discressionary system.IT IS NOT! Im just telling you guys why Im making out like a bandit when some of you seem very unsure.  And if market conditions go choppy, just ask me if Im doing anything. I may sit out lots of trades in the summer if volume goes dead again.

lets kick ass this whole month!!! * and dont believe all currencies move up or down against all the pairs. You all saw with NZD, USD, gBP and EUR  that some of them went up against the USD and down against other pairs. Only the JPY and CHF was easy redundant money. CHF went up against everything but USD,   AND jpy WENT DOWN AGAINST THE WORLD.  I also admit I did so well because I didnt use just the technical analysis our mentor and thread starter said to do. I got stopped out of 2 incredible looking long set-ups going with the JPY. And I started digging for fundamental answers. And I found them. Once I found that the Japanese prime minister and  BOJ were blatantly saying they need a weaker yen to get out of deflation, I knew I : HAD TO AVOID ALL JPY LONGS. IT WAS CANDY.   So I wont take all the credit. The BOJ 's big mouth gets some credit too. -)

HERE IS ANOTHER CHART, MY BEST TRADE OF THE WEEK , UP OVER 200 PIPS IN LESS THAN 3 TRADING DAYS. I ADDED LIKE AN HOUR OR 2 AFTER I ENTERED. LOOK AT THE POWER OF MR. DOJI AGAIN. They say unless you can explain your reason for taking a trade to a child, dont take it. Can we explain this easily...or what? Yuh think I care if we get stopped out now? Couldnt care less. I cant lose anymore. What a system he gave us!

--- 帖子 #746 ---
And look at the doji on the bottom of the last  chart on the red side. It was telling you..."Not right now. Wait another day or two...."  And MR DOJI WINS AGAIN. TWICE IN TWO WEEKS!

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Paul, this will make you feel better. You can wait till the high of the doji is broken to enter it if its not too large. Or enter and if stopped out, then re-enter when it is 30 or 40 pips higher or even the next candle. I like to enter right away because my risk is so small, that when I enter twice, Im not risking more than if I took a trade on one medium candle. Do what is comfortable as long as your risk doesnt get jacked up.

Shhhhhhhh...dont tell anyone this...but....you can enter on the candle after the doji...and put the stop on the candle BEFORE the doji for more room!

--- 帖子 #748 ---
By the way we have USD news all the way from 8:30am unemployment which is very big to the FOMC meeting of the minutes at 2pm. We can throw out all the charts after 5:30am. Time me on this. Then everyone goes into guess mode. I personally do not get out when news comes but with all this news all day long this is going to be a brokers dream and a great day for traders of 5 min charts. If we are ahead  by 3pm today its gonna be an awesome week!

But I was smart AND LUCKY, most of my pairs are not with  the USD.

***For the guy asking about a setup, the EUR/usd IS SETTING UP. Guess what, I cheated and got in the second the daily bar crossed the band.  I figure if Im hitting on almost everything Im touching this week, might as well go for it. Today is not the day to be first getting in anything with 6 pounds of news coming all day.

***Remember, you can always get in the second day if you want to wait out the news. Many setups will first be triggering tomorrow very late anyway. We win all around.

Oh also............gbp/usd is setting up and I think the news will make the charts move for days because both USD and GBP news is coming later on. Be careful,though.  I was a specialist in one thing in the stock market so i can manuever a bit easier with less stress than  some. I couldnt bend all these rules without years in trading rooms learning from real pros, as well as reading  a trainfull of books. This is the best system you will find I think because as you get more experienced you can adapt it to work with your other things you like. In my case, Fibs and weird moving averages and candle combinations. But this is the nuts for great "forced money management. Let all the expert day traders weave in and out on 5 min charts all day.looking to the 15 and 60  for CONFIRMATION! Those days are over for me.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Silat50 once again thanks for the education very informative. I cheated and jumped into the gbp/Usd and eur/Usd early couldn't resist that setup. Next trade I'll try your two enteries on the one candle.

Thanks,

Paul

OK looks like Cad/Usd setting up for a buy. Aud/Usd sell and Nzd/Usd sell but importantly its candle formation of dark cloud cover forming.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
hi silat

you write very well. but my main language is not english.

how possible for you to post to illustrate the above statement.

maybe many traders like me would understand with east with pictures

thanks for your time.

p.s. see no more the7 posting? wonder why?

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Good work! Now for my synopsis. I  personally will not take the aud and the cad play because both bands sharply point the other way. Yet....if the candle doesnt get much bigger on them, IT IS A WINNING PLAY. You will likely lose your money,but youll be getting a very good r/r. Im in too many winning positions to gamble now.

Now the USD/NZD IS very interesting! Because all of you missed the entry. you all were supposed to get in on the prior candle. But..... you may still jump in ASAP, before this candle gets any more range too it as  the risk is small. What I like about it is the last green candle  had such a big wick, you can smell the exhaustion from here, you agree? Also, not discussed but sometimes, only sometimes important, what i like as well is that the previous candle that was the first down candle had the highest volume on my chart of any day! Now whats interesting and neutral is  it is now 11:40pm and the candle is now  a decent size but the volume is next to nothing. That means there are only sellers for this to happen. So either this will collapse in the NY session or next day, or we get it rammed up our butts in the bat of an eye with any decent contrary volume for just 1 or 2 hours!

Let me consult my consultant.One minute................................aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand ZOLAR THE MAGNIFICENT has predicted...short this baby. Take a chance! I may even get in now.

To the other poster who wanted to see charts I have 2 charts already here. What do you think of them.they are lessons in dojis.

And to the person who wants to know where 7 went, he dropped dead when he saw his brokerage statement last month, as his sexy Brazilian girlfriend emptied his account.He was an old man. He was buried in Los Angeles....... and I took over the thread.

MY POSITIONS: I am long the AUD/CHF and already unloaded 1/3 of my position. Is that a huge move or what! I am short EUR/NZD, look at that dooooooooji I keep telling you guys about!!! I admit I got in before the doji closed and was pissed off that I ended up minus 20 pips to start off with. Im very very happy now!  I am long the CAD/JPY too. If I can figure out how to use my snagit I will show you guys proof by getting a snap of my acct. If its  too much trouble you guys will have to take my word for it.You can see they were all easy and clear trades. this has been the best forex december Ive ever had. God bless you ,seven, wherever you are.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Because of the gift we received from the BOJ and the Japanese prime minister that they were going to short the hell out of their own dollar to get it lower so they can go from deflation to 2% inflation, I advise not going long any japanese pairs at this time. If I am wrong I am wrong. Does anyone want to bet the technical players can out move the whole damn BANK OF JAPAN. lol (That for those who are new is  like our USA FED, and Bernanke.

Its not like we dont have any other plays to worry about,right?

I'm in the USD NZD.  Thanks.. The EURNZD has moved too far for me now . I'll wait for pull back

--- 帖子 #755 ---
guys, I have posted my real time real money results in my brokerage acct. Please be aware that at the bottom,t he total win is over 1400 pips, or there would be no comma there. It might not show. IS THIS SICK OR WHAT!!!!! Look how little time it took me to make this. Look at when the positions were initiated. I blocked out how much money I made. That is personal. I just want you to see I put my money where my mouth is. I play for real.   I never had to take more than 3 lots on any pair. Usually just 1 or 2. How can I do it? Those who hang out with me here or help me to open a room in 6-10 weeks will see this first hand. Yeah...I trade sometimes 6 hours a day...just watching the live charts. But 2 hours at all 3 time zones!!! Both the Asian,the London and NY.  tHEN MORE TIME FOR ANALYSIS! Guess what..... you don't have to. Its just for extra money. I hope one of these versions is open automatically as some of you couldnt see my charts so I did it in jpg. and pdf files. I challenge any trader on FF to beat what I am doing here.

I need the 2 of you who have been posting upcoming plays to keep doing it 2 or 3 times a week. Im getting burned out sniffing out plays on all three trading zones. I cant ever get a decent nights sleep. Let me know what you guys and gals think. I pray we can all be green big time by next Christmas. Big, I mean Big! Good work on the plays,guys. Lets keep working together in a rhythm. just like this. Not straying from the system but helping with  the plays and adding your own reasons you personally took the play or even if you didn't take something. We are onto something here guys. This rocks!

Silat50

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Where is everyone? You guys dont actually have jobs,do you?  Anyway this AUD/NZD that was pointed out to me is  a good lesson regardless whether we win or not. The play was long,right? Did we miss it? Of course. who wants to get  into it when it already went 80 pips in our favor? I like in now! Im getting in right "after" I post this at about 1.2673. LOng!  aT FIRST GLANCE THERE IS A LOT OF RESISTANCE ON THE DAILY CHART OVERHEAR JUST A FEW BARS TO THE LEFT. bUT KEEP LOOKING TO THE LEFT...BUT ON A WEEKLY CHART. nOW WHERE IS THE REZ? How about the 1.3200 area.

And what makes this interesting is that the most volume for the whole year going back to NOV 2011 IS RIGHT IN THOSE 2 WEEKS! That is the area where certain bankers jump in with both fists. So...we are going up and there isnt even much volume. Imagine if we get those banking and hedge fund boys back? We could break that rez and go to the next one. And what are we risking, by putting a stop under the present days low? Cha-Ching!  We have such a huge edge ,we win even if we lose. Im just taking a taste for one lot. Speaking of taste.....

I dont advise going to the weekly. It makes things way too complicated,but this just caught my eye, and with a 10-1 risk-reward ratio. Jesus H. Christ!

I am going to be asking for volunteers from all of you to contribute certain things that need to be investigated, records kept and news reported. Im going to pick out my first choice for our new trading room. I need that investigated too. Lets work as a team.

Silat 50

I have been monitoring this forum since mid Dec and am very impressed with it's simplicity. Although not trading any signals yet I have been monitoring about 15 pairs.

The problem I see is not the entry, that is staight forward, but the exit. I have seen numerous times ( live and backtesting) a trade getting closed on a retrace and close back in the channel and supposedly a trade in the opposite direction, only to see a continuation of the original trend. This dilemma needs addressing with a firm set of rules as to when to again enter the original trend. Most of the time a valid re-entry as per the rules does not occur. I have attached a chart to show an example.

I live in Australia and generally trade the early London session, although I am at home some Mondays and Teusdays for trading. As I start work early, I have a problem trading the system as the daily bar starts whilst I am at work, and cannot therefore take the signals.

I am interested in joining any group or assisting in any way I can. I have been trading for about 8 years.

Keep up the good work, I find your posts very informative.

Cheers

Silat50 sorry I'm on NY time and sleep is important, keeps me away from interfering with the trades lol. Why I went with cad/Usd even though the bands were pointing down the stoch was showing some divergence and it hit the resistance level for a second time making a W. got in and out. As for nzd/Usd the candle you are talking about was a good indicator but opened in the band and closed outside it. Which is reverse for entry rule. That's why I waited and saw the dark cloud cover candle take form. Got in and out, all for a profit.

Whatever you do count me in regarding trading room.

what do you thing of h4 with this trading method?

--- 帖子 #760 ---
If you want to take a look at it go right ahead. If you do, I would monitor a couple of charts though just to see. With the daily charts alot less going back and checking to see and you have time to jump in if you miss the entry. I traded the hour charts couldnt keep up always one step behind. Never really dealt with the 4 hour chart. As of now the daily is working for me. What it comes down to is your preference and what you are comfortable with.

Silat50

Can you give a list of pairs that you trade with this system. Also what indicators you are using that way we get a visual with the education and you dont have to keep posting charts. Or at least similar indicators, I know some people have their favorites. So everyone is on the same page. I did your entry on the gbp/usd left with profit on both enteries. only thing I didnt like was that I had to close the first trade before I could close the second one. Maybe next time Ill increase the lot size that way I can close half of the trade and keep the other half going. Otherwise very good week for me, even though Im dealing with a micro account.

Paul

--- 帖子 #762 ---
hi guys,

Let me address your questions 1 at a time:

Paul, I hate that also. When you close a position it takes you out of the first one firs so you never can see how your oldest lot is really doing in total pips. It sucks, I know

Paul, we will count you in when the room opens "if" you can be there daily. either london or ny.

Paul I dont have a list of FAVORITE PAIRS....YET!  I will be having you guys do research for me later on. For now my favorites are whats hot or cold. I love the EUR/AUD. EUR/CAD SHORT BUT ITS TOO LATE FOR YOU GUYS TO GET IN. YOU ALL SAW MY STATEMENT. I am making sick money on those pairs. or,do it this way.....

JPY: LOOKING TO SHORT AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY REGARDLESS WHAT IS OTHER PAIR.

aud. VERY STRONG NOW. Plus people always go back to where the higher interest is...eventually. Same for Cad.

CHF-HAS BEEN INVULNERABLE  AGAINST EVERY PAIR ACCEPT usd. Lets keep looking to go long,especially against weaker crap like NZD,EUR,

Pairs I dont like: aud/cad  eur/gbp    they are for daytraders. My question is....who ever invented them. They are redundant pairs.

Greg, I cant get into exit strategy here. that here it would be changing the whole system. Just follow along as I sometimes will tell when i get out that is not within the rules. TRY TO FOLLOW RULES EXACTLY. MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO PICK THE RIGHT PAIR SO YOU NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT EXIT...YES?   You could always get out of half your position once you had 3 or 4 big days and they are way way outside the band. Or,,,,, on a bar that gets really long, you could just move your stop to break even +2. Always get paid a little something on every trade you can. PERSONALLY i FIND IF i GO AGAINST THE EXIT STRATEGY, I SCREW MYSELF AS THE TREND JUST RESUMES AFTER A SCARY 3/4 BAR PULLBACK.  I also will jump out on bad news.  Try to find reasons to "follow" this system, not do other things. Even I get scared shit at times just like now when ive booked 262 pips in a single lot in 2 days and i say, how much more can i get? gotta follow. you could always place your stop 1/2 way down the bar if its a big engulphing ...."AND.....YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROFIT.

Greg, what are you not understanding? I will help. daily bars are easy to manage if you have to work. just get in the trade put your stop at the previous candles high or low, and forget about it until you get home or wake up next day.

Paul, I feel the same quite often, if i get up for the NY session after placing my trades, yeah i might find something to get intop thats moving(but it aint the system,really) but more often than not...we get in trouble and interfere with our own success. the brokerages love that. Its called :more spread, more profit...for them!

This morning session was a waste of time. NY sees all the japanese pairs are so over extended they are afraid to get in, but wont short either. I cant see any big pullbacks on JPY  for a good while. it might be one of those black swan events. once in a decade move.  FOLLOW THAT JPY!!!! CHF  SEEMS TO BE MEDIUM TERM GOOD AS SO MANY ARE NOT LOOKING AT USD OR EUR AS ONLY CURRENCIES TO CHOOSE FROM. BOTHY ARE NOW UNSAFE. i DONT LIKE THAT PAIR. IS MOST UNSTABLE OF ALL MAJORS NOW. I AMY NOT EVEN TAKE THE NEXT SIGNAL. ANY MORE QUESTIONS, JUST ASK......

Once we get rolling, I want guys to volunteer for differnet jobs. 1 guy will track NEWS. another guy will follow 1 or 2 pairs and give me the stats i need on them. another guy will show us metals and index futures charts when they get in so we can record how they do compared to spot Forex. Another guy can make me fibonacci charts on daily weekly and hourly charts. Lots for all of us to do together.

I will be around over the weekend if you guys have questions. Let me repeat what I said before. Dont worry about changing the system to get better exits, worry about if there are 4 signals which is the one that is going to give you the best r/r and the one thats going to bust open the quickest. Pick the pair, not the system.

Does anyone here live in Florida? I was hoping since I dont have "connections" down here.....PM me if you know what Im talking about. Maybe we could meet up for lunch one day.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Some of you are PMing me on this: Yes, yes, I am going to be doing a lot of research on how to scale "out" of a position." I prefer to teach how to scale "into" a position and get out at one time.  Also we need to find a way for re-entries when we get dinged out on one bad day. Who wants to be my research analyst and alert me to every pair thats in a strong trend but got dinged out on one bar?  Who "nose" what could happen.  if we put our heads together. The journey is long, my friends. Stay thirsty! Isnt that from a commercial? LOL

Im still trying to get into the swing with the daily charts (was playing with the hour charts). I usually set a TP between 30 and 50 pips. Havent gotten the courage (got to see the wizard, lol) to let it run. I think with the increase in lot size will work better that way I can jump out at least half way and let the other half run. As for the Flordia thing I have no idea what the hell you are talking about, lol. But its probably alot warmer there than NY. Now that the weekend is here and when we start a new week do you include the Saturday/Sunday candles or strictly go to the Sunday/Monday ones? Also when and what time on Sunday would you like to talk about trades for the week?

Can you post that indicator

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Paul,

If you are looking to take 30-50 pip gains on daily bars, you will get destroyed because you are risking more than you can make. Usually not a good idea. But...respect your feelings. If 100 pip risk is too much for you and i assume you are only doing 2 lots. Go down to one. if doing regular lots, go down to mini lots. if doing mini lots go down to micro lots. its only 10 cents a pip for god sake. thats only 10 dollars for 100 pip move. If you cant afford that......

Paul, did you see my brokerage platform that showed me making over 1400 pips in  just days? You cant do that at 30-50 pips at a time. Ahhhhh, thats another thing id like all of you to do. When you put a trade on, as soon as you get in, write in a journal/log(you all keep a log,right???? Of every single trade!!!) Hint-if its a bother, you are overtrading.    write down immediately upon entering your trade and stop, how much risk in pips you have taken on for each lot. Then report it top me at the end of the week. This is more meaningful than you think. So everyone  would right now be adding up all their trades pip risks into one number,then dividing that number by the amount of trades you entered. Only the entry! ok guys?

You ask if I count saturday and sundays days candles. I didnt know there were any. the week ends now at friday afternoon at 5pm, and begins sunday afternoon which is technically monday for the asians. so there really is no sat or sun bars.

LESSON OF THE WEEK: Did all of you read about me saying that I was not going to take the CHF/jpy short setup today. It was clear as day, and by the way, I love those size bars. Perfect! Not too small where you know youll get dinged out, but not huge risk either. Why didnt I take it? 2 reasons #1-I told you all I usually wont take trades where both bands face up when the trade is short. Everyone look at this chart now to soak it in,please.  #2-The news was that japan is going to be under constant downward pressure and that doesnt show in the charts.

I even said..."you have soooo many other trades, why worry about that one" as some of you were about to jump in.

Now tell me the truth...who took that trade? =)

nOW WHAT IS THIS NEW INDICVATOR SOME OEN HERE HAS. iD LIKE TO SEE IT ALSO. gUYS....AS LONG AS ITS NOT TOO MUCH, and doesnt get us sidetracked, feel free to show any new indicators or ideas that you are pretty sure are HELPING  you. Because I know not one of you is going to leave life simple and follow my directions. LOL bUT SERIOUSLY, WE ARE A team. Everyone is free to contribute new ideas and even mention news items that might help or hurt us. Dont believe those "experts" who say never follow the news."  What I made in pips following this japanese report helped to make this along with my team and the system, the the best week of my forex life.Yes we ignore 97% of news, but the truth is, so much of your money will be made on news if you can take that 3%

TIMES available:   Everyone please post here what times they are available to be in the new trade room I may start in 6-8 weeks. Also, is there a chat feature we can use on FF here to all meet over the wekend for like 30 min to talk?

WEEKLY ROUNDUP: IM NOT HAPPY HOW THIS WEEK ENDED UP. NY showed no interest in any of the pairs that I could see. They didnt even punce on the JPY short. Dont get excited yet, they just ran out of money till monday.

The AUD was awful today. It should have just stayed in bed. It didnt create any profit for us, and didnt retract enough to make us any new set ups. The CHF could have stayed home too. Dead!  And the EURO as I hit the bullseye again, the only people who made money on it either way were short term day traders on 5 min charts...."LIKE WE USED TO BE,RIGHT FELLAS?

Ok guys, dont go snortin or shortin your weekend away. I think we have a real interesting week coming up. Monday should be more an observing day as we will find out a lot of things about our buddies the 3 stooges, the EUR,CAD,AUD.   AND...... WATCH THE NZD!  iT HAS BEEN ACTING LIKE A druggie on too much percocet or oxys. Totally lame. Dont be surprised if it wakes up this week. Also  NZD is one of the best currencies to try new things on as its daily and even weekly range is very slow compared to other currencies.

I am still very suspicious of any lasting  EURO RALLY but if charts say to go long, I may have to hold my nose and do it. Or...pass.

i will be opening a signals thread for this '''the7 system''''' in the interactive trading forum.

please all go and post your signals, as you see them, on that thread. so that everyone can see and benefit from what signals are materialising.

strictly a signals only thread.

anything to do with the actual strategy itself should be discussed here and not on the signals thread.

i will open the thread on monday, so please everyone here join in. it will be good for all.

(p.s. i dont trade this system that often, but out of the 6 trades i have taken, only one had a loss. i wait and look for high probability entries even if it means waiting days on end. i took long on eu last night, currently in profit. once i close this position in profit, that will be 7 wins and just 1 loss.  this is a very good daily system. worth sticking to. trust me, i have tested countless number of systems here on ff in the last two years.)

It's the hour time frame in me lol. What I have been doing with the daily trades has been setting the sl at the previous high or low and leaving tp open. But when I see the profit at what I used to take muscle memory kicks in and clicks the close button, lol. I think there are chat sites for meetings that are free.

Thanks for the info

Ps I'll try to stay away from the close button. Lol

Count me in, I will be available for the London session.

One indicator that I have just come across is for supply and demand areas. It is excellent for short timeframes, but as yet have not had sufficent time to analyse it's worth on the daily timeframe. Will monitor and let you know if is worth persuing.

As I can only spend a few hours a day for trading, and generally hope to make 20/40 pips a day, this system should generate more pips, less stress and a happier wife for not neglecting her.

Look forward to working with you and contibuting to the forum.

What indicator are you using for the yellow and pink lines?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Silat50

See charts showing supply and demand levels. I picked this one to show you as price is about to enter a supply zone formed way back in Sept 2008. I have included a compressed chart to show this. Theoritically it should provide resistance and reverse but I realise with the Japanese Governments intervention in the Yen this area may not hold. The MA channel is also still pointing up which may see a period of consolidation before any possible reversal. The lower red/pink bands are demand zones formed on the trend up and would provide support to any move down.

gregben

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Silat50,

This chart gives an example of a Demand Zone reversing price and also showing potential target.

Those lines are part of NanningBob's 10.2A system.  You can find it on Steve Hopwood's site.

I was using them to see if they can be useful as a way to trail the position

Also on the right side it gives the weekly and monthly pivots which can be used for possible train stops.

Ok greg. thats cool. youll have to tell us for "sure" whether that beats a simple last bar high/low stop for accuracy. Let us know when you have over 100 results. Less than that arent meaningful.

Heres an interesting chaRT TO CHEW ON,BOYS. This chart may setup on monday for tuesday for us on a long. You are supposed to take it. You are not supposed to use any discression. But me personally, I will only take it if i cant find anything else. hOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT THIS CHART!?

The white lines are the bands. It will be interesting to hear everyones opinion on one chart. There is no right or wrong answer.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Eur/Usd-- yea looks good for long.  Looks like it is near the 68-76% fib re-trace .  Would like to see the candle close inside the bands.Can you post the time for the meeting, a few hrs ahead?  that would be greatThanks

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Tentatively the meeting will be at 8pm  est.  Just click on the link I put up and we can try it. I dont know if we will have audio as it says my mike is fine but it didnt work last time. this is just an informal  "getting started" webinar. Nothing serious.But we have to make sure the room works.

As far as the chart is concerned that I posted....of course guys....yes we have to wait until mondays candle closes to see if it sets up inside the band. My question is, guessing that it will....wiould you take the trade....and why?

I already see the webinars are not going to be easy because everyone is on a different time zone. Lets do the best we can. Maybe I can even learn how to make them available as recordings after we do them so youll have all week to view them. One step at a time.

It might take 6-8 weeks to finally get things rolling seamlessly and easy. Patience.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Also, I think it would be good if we used our real pics or at least an avatar to identify ourselves. We need to have a visual connection with each other. It WILL affect our trading and learning on this thread. I didnt want to use steven seagal, but use my real pic. FF refused both my pics so I said lets see if it refuses steven. Sure enough he is posted and up in 3 seconds.   But I wanted my real pic. So post anything you want guys.  I cant wait for monday. As I said before, I dont think it will be good for trading but as a setup day for the whole week!

Another question for the board:

WHAT MAKES THIS SYSTEM SO VALUABLE, AND ABLE TO PUT US IN PROFITS?

Answer that and also the chart question,guys.  See you all tomorrow night at 8pm in the chatroom or monday back here.

is the7 still use this 5 hi/lo?

or an advanced version?

however the candle tail retraced at RN1.3000 or 50% fibo... imho.

happy pipping to all next week.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
No the bands are pointing down and the down candle was a strong one. And if it was to go up i think the r/r is not good enough to trade.

Could you post a link maybe.  Looked but could not find you.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Oops my mistake. you said Monday

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Paul,

The boxes that are not coloured in are one's that have rejected price more than once.

See attached chart as an example on a 5 min chart.

As the thread is for daily trading only, and I have only been using this indicator for a short period, I have not had sufficient time to test the indicator live to work out it's worth on this timeframe (backtesting looks fine, but you must get live data to support any theory) . I do know however, that on the shorter timeframes that I have had time to evaluate, that it works very nicely.

gregben

--- 帖子 #801 ---
No pama,

the rules for entry have not been met yet. But this is how I try to do it if I have the time. I try to see what might be setting up in one more candle and what type(if any) of candle would make me want this trade..."before" it comes out.  My question is, if mondays candle goes thru the lower band and closes there, do you like the trade? And if so,why?

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Are we doing this meeting tonite

If you cant get into the room tonight or it wont work as I see no way to even test my microphone, then PM me with your email so i can invite you to webex.com which is another service i signed up for.

Silat50,

Am monitoring 20+ pairs and entered my first trade of this sytem today. Entered short GBPCHF with a small position to test the water.

My question is, I looked at a 4 hr chart of the system and it was showing a buy signal. Would this alert you to wait a little longer before entering to get confirmation, or have I done the correct thing by only adhering to the daily chart?

gregben

--- 帖子 #822 ---
ok guys around about that time anything looking good?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Hi Paul,Not much action on the forum. Is meeting going ahead?Entered short GBPCHF yesterday, slightly ahead.To-days setups were EU long, GU long, ECad long,GCad (close to setup, maybe not into band enough),UChf short ( maybe not valid because previous bar did not open outside the band).What have you seen?greg

--- 帖子 #824 ---
PM silat your email so we can get it going.

usd/jpy and cad/jpy both evening stars but touching both bands.

i kinda like eur/cad long

some other ones but r/r not worth it.

I was sitting on usd/cad for long has not hit my entry so i just might forgo it. was going long with it.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
ok cool. hows the testing going with that indicator?

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Paul,Still not enough time to properly evaluate merit on daily time frame, although does work well on shorter ones.A few of the Yen crosses are near supply zones (resistance levels) so it will be interesting to see if they reverse price.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
No Greg, why make it more complicated than it is. Maybe sometimes I will look at a weekly to see if we are at rez.  If you look at enough time frames, your bound to find conflict. This is a simple system. If you like to do that, thats fine. But then you are doing a different system. Right?

--- 帖子 #831 ---
As long as we are getting on a different topic, look at this trade I took because of the hourly set-up and then look at i6t now on a daily, its the perfect r/r and that doji like top once again. Why am I doing it on a 60m when I told you it doesnt work on that time frame, because if you put a 20 moving average on that hourly chart, it sits on top of exactly the right bar that is holding all resistance together. I wont take this trade off until it breaks the 20ema, not included here. This wil bet you killed in most cases, but look at it on the daily too. THATS OUR SYSTEM

Also news is out at 3am on the CHF and I want small losses and huge gains on news so that alone moved me to the hrly. If I get head faked, hey....take my money. Look like the smart money is acting now wioth a drop out of the base. Im short at: 96718 just maybe 20 min ago. I will try not to post these off topic charts but this was such a beauty. I mean,, you could take it on the daily or the hourly. gotta love it. I will trail down the 20 for days if it lets me. Actually thats if the news lets me.

Also, play what you see, not what you think.

#2-Expect some retracement on all the JPY pairs but I d be shocked as hell if this was a reversal instead of maybe a .382 correction. I doubt we will even see that much. But I will continue to use this system and take its signals. I am not smarter than the market and greg.....the 4 hour chart is not smarter than the daily.

And sure you could get in now on either the hourly or the daily, but pick one and stay withy it. The hourly you will have to come back and reset the stop every 2 or 3 hours or so. What I do is once 20ma IS AT BREAKEVEN OF BETTER i JUST LOOK AT IT WHEN i FEEL LIKE IT.Then I dont care

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Also guys, I may at any time be pulled away for several days at a time. I wont disappear. But as you all saw, I had so many positions opne, almost all in profit, Im starting to have my eyeballs cross! ha! So I may chill out a bit. Also I dont know if my keyboard is messed up or Im drinking waaaaay to much coffee but I dont like  all these cap sentences Im using. My apologies. Too many of them.  Lets make some money tonight boys!

I hope I posted the right chart. Snagit or whatever program in FF is using doesnt let me preview my charts. Why?

Anyway, does thias chart look anything like the last chart I posted. Yet its identical pretty much. This is why I developed a system for having 2 or 3 different platforms showing me the same chart. Looks like 3 different apirs sometimes. Really gives you a perspective from 3 different angles.

funny, i dont have either of these signals on my alpari daily charts.

on my chart, the audjpy pair should give a sell signal at the end of today.

which broker are you using ?

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Guys, I am adding to my GBP/CHF position now as there is only a 20 pip stop loss. What advantage is there to wait until the japanese session? Either it will close up most of the 20 pips and its never worth adding without at least 20 pips to protect you.

Also, whether adding a second position or just opening one up....why not do it before the close...if you think you are getting in at a better price than it will be after the first hour or two as thew first hour the spreads are terrible. Im short at 1.48355 for my add on. How can I ever get better than that. I probably will lose with only 20 pips protecting me. But I bet you Im getting 10 or 15-1 on my money. All day long!!!!!

Tip: I dont care if your position is moving against you in this system, it just gives you reason to add. But that's if you are not in losses. Remember an object in motion tends to stay in motion.

I also might try one of the JPY pairs as those are the only ones that are giving off signals. Just a tiny taste.

To the gentleman who wanted to know about brokers. I personally use FXCM but I think its Paul and gregs charts you are asking about,yes? Im curious myself how they do. In fact greg, how HAVE you been doing the last 2 days? Are you in demo or live mode with those new charts?

--- 帖子 #837 ---
THE JAPANESE GAMBLE:

If we are going to do an asinine thing like go against the BOJ and just use charts like we are supposed to,  why not take a pair that has a doji as either the current bar or as many of em have, the previous bar as the previous bar proves its already tired. The you have a good reason other than blindly following a system. And we just need this japanese president to take a rest for a few datys and we might see 3 or 4 huge bars in our favor before resuming. Otherwise its a small loss.

And dont be cheap guys and not take the whole bar, not put your stop at the top of the previous bar. I know some of you. Dont chince on this.

Silat50,Sorry couldn't reply earlier as I am just home from work.I trade two separate live account and the last 2 days have been positive ones.The profitable days cannot solely be attributed to the supply and demand indicator. I shorted GBPCHF purely on your method, and am in profit with it, as I mentioned I sold 4 yen crosses that were getting close to the supply zone shown by the indicator, and were also showing signs of a reversal. I closed all 4 for profits ( could have gotten more, but if I had left them open todays move up would have wiped out those gains).The rest of my trades were based on my own method on shorter timeframes and in conjunction keeping a close eye on the supp/dem indicator. Some winning trades, some losers but finished with green pips.As I stated in an earlier post I have only recently come across the indicator, and I am still learning how best to trade with it. I will say however that I am optomistic about this one, as many other new indicators that I have tried have been junked after a day or two. Will keep everyone posted as I have more time to trade with it and evaluate it's usefulness.gregben

Hey guys been following this thread for a while now great system, Ive posted what I believe according to the system is about to be a good long signal in the TRADING DISCUSSIONS FORUM (GBP/JPY). Assuming the price holds over the next 4hrs (UK)

Thanks to " The7 "  for this great  simple method of trading.

One for the 9 to 5 ers  ..... nice .

To anyone out there:I have been using the Luktom Visual Order Editor (IVOE) as a trade manager for these trades.I like it much better than Hopwood's MPTM simply because I can t figure his out with all the options and inputs on it.The IVOE is much simpler and does exactly what I want which is to take off 1 lot at 30-40 pips, keep the other lot as a runnerwith the original stop in place, but it also has the added feature of moving your TP and SL right on the chart similar to Ninja's Chart trader.Anyway, my question is...since it's an EA, do I have to keep the MT4 open all the time in order for it to manage the trades?I hope not, dont really want to rent a VPS.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
So how many made a bunch on the Jpy crosses?Looks like I got out a little too early. oh well

--- 帖子 #848 ---
can you post the ea or where you picked it up. I know in the past my computer was shut off by accident and the ea i was running did work. I guess you got to try it out. Unless any programmers may know.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Yes it seems it would still work , but not sure if all the orders go into the broker or not,

such as the close partial , etc.

Here it is, and remember to use an extra zero if you have 5 digit broker

ANOTHER WINNER IN THE MAKING:

The:GBP/CHF trade I gave all of you at 148:35 or better is now at 1:4736.  My stop moved to the top of the last bar. Im in profit now no matter what happens. Dont know what some of you are doing futzing around with all knds of entry and exit methods to make this system "better" but Im happy just the way it is. I added 4 subjective other ways to play this system so you all shouldnt be too bored..

I am also in over 100 pips profit on each of my 3 lots on the CAD/JPY  long. Remember on this one I use an hourly above the 12ema,  to get in. Im only doing it because the JPY is not something I want to go short with,with full risk.. How do I get out? 1 of 2 choices: Either use high of previous bar as in our "7" system or use  a break below the 20ema as a stop.

Question for the board:1 What is the biggest danger we have in using this system? 2-What is the best part about this system?

To me the biggest danger is that when we get stopped out when we are clearly on a long or medium term run, we might not be able to get back in.

The best part of the system is once you place your stop, it can only be moved more and more in your favor without all the other nutty moving average corssovers and MACD.Stochastics and  over-evaluation most other systems are using.

Danger:Yesterdays daily bar had the highest volume in a long time and it was on almost of all the pairs.The volume has been increasing steadily every day on everything, even if its a small or doji type bar. Not a regular market action,thats for sure. In one way this is good for us as trend traders. But we are being played for suckers as big volume is coming in at the oddest hours. Yesterday at 4-5pm was like 8am action. Are we heading for a climax or is this a black swan event to be remembered for many years? I personally hope that this is for the JPY what the nazdaq was for stockmarket traders....years of profits!

I have been stopped out of most of the positions I showed all of you with healthy profits. My worry is how can I get back in without 2 or 3 losing days in a row and then the trend resuming without break againts the JPY pairs. EUR/USD and GBP/USD is a mess on the charts. I dont want any part of them...not this week or next, anyway.

Is every one else here winning? I hope so,boys.

Prosper1

I use other indies to help with the decision. Fibo, supply demand, stoch. I know it's not part of the system but every system is faulty. My entry is the high or low of the signal candle. I believe you need to be comfortable with your own system but with the 7 signal of a trade as your first indicator. Then with the help of your other indies. Then which pair you think has the best odds for a profitable trade.

I know my statement does not follow the 7's to the letter but it my money no one else's lol

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Thanks Paul,Yes that's the hindrance I run into with using other confirmations.  I start over anlyzing.I know they help with trend runs, but the beauty of The7 system is that it picks perfect tops and bottomsat times and no indicator can respond that fast except for two I have found...Sup/Dem and divergence on a macd,stoc. etc.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Prosper1 checkout the indie I posted both files go into the indicator folder. Its quick fib has been working very good with the supply and demand indie. I think its very helpful. And yes dont over analyze otherwise you will be banging your head off the wall.

Brilliant. I haven"t seen anything like this to catch the trend from the origin.

Again thanks to The7.

haven't???

then let me show you a better one:

google the "flying buddha", on this forum too.

when a candle bar is above and not touching 7 MA, you sell.  (buy is vice versa)

now, thank me.

the7 is MERELY an entry method.  that's it, no less, no more.

HOTTEST 2 PAIR:

Has anyone noticed that the CHF on the long side and the JPY on the short side were the most consistant "gimmees" for  a long while already. The NZD too has trended very, very nicely against almost everything. Up several days, then down several days and big bars too. Just what the 7 system eats for lunch to get all its nutrition.

So, how do we use this info about these 3? You guys can figure it out. I can only bring it to your attention.

Now ,on another note, I asked for volunteers to keep stats. Every pair has different traders trading it. Do you think every bank and every hedge fund and every bi,big private trader, and every blind pool, and every hedger has the same goals and time frames they are trading for on every pair? NO WAY!   We can make this system much better than it is now. Trust me. You guys know Ivwe already thrown out some good ideas. But now that itrs 4:06pm on friday, this might be the most important hour of the week as its "the Last Chance hour." Last chance to cover your shorts, take your profits, cut your losses, get into a position you know news will be coming out on over the week end, or maybe just balance your books. So what no one has been able to tell me is: What pairs over the last 2 years have gone up the most in the last hour of trading? What pairs have gone up and down the most in the first hour of trading on sun night/mon morning? This info might be enormous..it might be nothing. JUST 100 WEEKS OF DATA TO SIFT THRU.

2-What pairs respect certain Fib numbers the most?

3-What pairs respect what moving averages the most?

4-What pairs do not move with their cousins on a big move. Like lets say the EUR is moving big, well wont most pairs with EUR MOVE BIG TOO? Sure. But...what EUR pairs go their own way or better for us...opposite their "cousin pairs?" I saw that a lot with the EUR and the GBP and the NZD. Did not see it at all on the JPY. Give me some stats guys!

Also, its the weekend, no trading to do...how about if you guys just look at charts and go hunting for your own stats you find that can make us money.

5-When will people suddenly run into the AUD and CAD for the interest? There has to be special events and times it occurs. I dont know them. No trader can memorize all stats. I had a friend in a stocks chat room that kept a log of what times the markets reversed all day until  3:35pm. The major times NOT  to go with a trend> And he made boo-coo bucks doing it.

6-My mentor in stocks, Paul Lange said that you should not get into trades from 11:15am -1:30 as this is the dead time, lunch time for the market. No volume and why waste time . What I want to klnow is...how can we capitalize on this "drift" in US stocks by playing the USD with certain pairs? Or is it a non-event too? Come on guys,we can put together like 50-100 meaningful stats in the next 3 months, we will add 25% or more to our annual net profit. If not a lot more!

Have a good weekend, get some exercise, work out, eat good.......and never sit down on a wet toilet seat in a public bathroom.

Question for the 7 Clan:

The GBP/USD has set up as a crisp, clear short to be taken sunday nite/monday morning-depending on your time zone.

Whats interesting(or nauseating) about analyzing this trade is on the weekly we have either a triple top or even a quadruple top depending how you count tops if you just lay your curser across the open of the 1.62780 bar and look to the right. I find that wicks and tails can often be cut thru when laying a line for a double or triple top or bottom as it is the body that is most relevent anyway. Some people do not use the wicks in measuring fibs, anyone ever try that?

So, we have huge rez at:1.62780 WHICH WONT HELP US....from getting stopped. Its a bit too far away. But I hope it has some effect as REZ is often more a general area,than an exact point. Especially with double and triple bottoms and tops.

Now on the daily....we have 3 lower highs if you throw out that ridiculous "stop grabber" wick on one candle. Very bearish. Also weekly on this system, we'd be in a short or stopped out from one.But no long in sight on a weekly chart.

Back to the daily, you have that huge green engulfing bar which is to me one of the most bullish signs one can see, especially if it goes thru BOTH bands!!!!

TIP: If you went long using my ultra-successful same bar entry method when it went one tick past the previous bars high and got in before even half that green bar was done forming, I say it is perfectly fine to stay long because that tail gives you plenty of room and just place your stop under that wick. In fact, this is IMHO, THE REAL "nuts and bolts" of this system. That if you ran this trade 200 times, and all of you each took different sides each time, BOTH the longs and the shorts would be winners as the money would come from the poor traders with bad moeny mgmt. This proves right here that as long as your R/R is big enough, it sometimes doesn't matter what side you are on, just as long as you exit properly. I LUV IT!

So the question remains, if you have to take the trade, which way does it look like to you? And is anyone actually getting in this?

ME: Standing aside.

***Also there was a clear as day short getting in on that huge pin head wick candle  a few days ago. Anyone jump on that weakness that the longs gave back around 120 pips on that one candle! I didnt take it cause I had too many trades going. Big mistake. It was too easy.  So now you guys can answer using your own opinion, not the 7 system. Im dying to hear how we all sum this up. Might be a hell of an interesting week.

--- 帖子 #862 ---

Yes.    Eyeballing the pair/s  past pa says the same .

Past price set up/occurance  will reveal the characteristics of that huge bar and may provide entry guidance.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
As of tomorrow I am going to stop daytrading and only trade the 7 Trading System for 1 month. It will certainly be less time consuming, less stressful and hopefully more profitable. I see other traders doing very well and my own observations over the last couple of weeks have prompted my decision.

I have studied my charts ( I have 2 indicators that I use extensively that I will use to filter entries) and come up with the following possible trades following the rules.

GBPUSD: Short - Will not take this trade as my filters show more strength in upward move.

GBPAUD: Long - Yes

GBPNZD: Long - Waiting ( passes filter test but SL required too large. If we get a solid retracement I may then enter.

USDCAD: Long - Yes

AUDUSD: Short - Yes

AUDCAD: Short - Yes

NZDUSD: Short - Yes ( larger SL required but passes filters)

I have a watch alert on the NZDJPY and AUDJPY pairs to perhaps fall into the band soon and to a lesser degree the CADJPY and CHFJPY

Will be ready to enter at tomorrows open

good idea greg. you ''should'' have more success with longer term trading.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
You picked out the best plays,Greg. If I may offer a suggestion that everyone says they do, and almost no one does which is critical: Keep a log or journal for every play you make from the 7 system and every other system. Best to have a repeater notebook just for the 7. Heres why- You write down all the plays  that the 7 gives you and write down each profit and loss as each pair closes its trade.   But thats not good enough! Because then you have to write down completely separately all the plays you got with  the 2 filters you use. separate area of the notebook and treat it like a totally separate system.

Now it gets harder. Nobody is going to get out, especially after holding a big winner for 2-400 pips when the system calls for it. Its human nature to take profits early. So npow you need a sperate space in that notebook for every variation of the 7 system that uses a different EXIT strategy!

Secret: Does this sound like too much work? It is! It is why most traders will fail, and why I asked for volunteers to keep track of stats and data. One person will spend 3 hours a day just making entries in his log. But if you have a wife or friend who is helping you...then it can be done pretty easy. So what do I do?

I try NOT  to keep track of more than 2 or 3 different variations in total in the system, and usually only the ones I play for real money. If you are in demo, you have to decide. One of my mentors said........"If keeping track of your trades seems like too much work...it is a sign you are over trading!" When he told me that it woke me the hell up real fast!

Now if you have another system or this one, you use on different time frames, you need that many more notebooks. I cant even begin to tell you how much of my entries got so overwhemming that I couldnt keep track of a system. It worked on a daily chart. Didnt work on a 60m chart. It worked with big stops, failed with little ones, did good if RSI was poining between 12-2pm ,didnt work if...if, if, if,

Try top keep this simple.

And I know this is not in the system, but if you really like something in this system and you see it took off without ypou or you are getting to your computer late, why not wait until the next day and get in on the 2nd day entry we spoke of but put your stop under this days bar that you missed. But what if I like the original stop, should I use the original stop from 2 days ago? You know better than me, right? Why?  You are supposed to be keeping track on how that works.

And thats why 95% of TRADERS will fail. It isnt the trading we cant do, sometimes it's the preparation. But dont tell anyone that, they wont be able to sell their expensive courses and books.  LOL

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Silat 50,

As you can see from the spreadsheet with my entries in the signals forum, I intend to do this with the comment column to state vatiations I take. You are right though, keep it simple. My filters are there to filter what I think are the best trades to take, as with margin and larger stops than I am used to to take into account with MM it is not possible to take all the trades on offer.

Hi Silat,

Could you kindly direct me to the results page for the sevens system. It seems to be lost on the forum.

Many thanks,

Tim.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Tim, there really isnt a result page yet. All there is and it s on this thread is my results shown on a snapshot where i made over 1400 pips in a few days with this system.a dn other guys tell you what they did here and there. We did however start a "trade listing" thread where people post their plays. Its new and i dont know if people will posy their actual result or you will need to do it manually. here it is:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=404227     The bill is $3.95 for that information. Dont worry, it was already charged to your credit card.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
I cant believe I missed the GBP/JPY play that triggered yesterday. id be up over 120 pips now and id probably take a second lot and put it over the top of todays high. the doji was right there before confirmation just as I like. my favorite setup in the world for forex, and never saw it.  Goes to show how the human eye can only see so many things at once. it also is a warning we may have too much criteria or  in my case too many systems to see everything we need to. im guilty.

I did take 3 pairs against the jpy starting from yesterday towards the close so i have a nice lead already.plus im still long on the aud/chf with my stop placed under the 12 ema 60 min chart as I will use that sometimes as an exit strategy. Is it wrong? yes. part of the system? no? does it make me money? definitely.

Warning: This JPY may be short lived as I think Bernanke owes the japs another round of buying after abe bought over 50 billion in bonds from us recently. I say ol ben cranks this party up for one last blast into the past! But lets get a few really good days of jpy strength first. wouldnt it be sweet if the jpy zigged and zagged in perfect unison,setting up 3 or 4 winning trades in a row for us all on this system? As Ralph Kramden says.......

--- 帖子 #871 ---
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT EUR/USD SHORT NOW?

If you look at it on a weekly chart, the only thing saving that pattern from the bottom of the weekly chart to the top is that one little wick that is saying for 2 days this pair took a breather? Thats a bit too dangerous for me as a steady diet. But.....I think I went partners with 9 other guys on 1 micro lot to keep my losses small and went ahead and shorted it.

Why? The chances of this short working are the chances of finding 5 kilos of uncut cocaine in your bed when you wake up. LOL .  However....if this short works out to where I think it could, and that is to retrace the entire up pattern and then bounce off of that 100.00 fib number, the R/R would be soooooo sweet, if you just added to it 2 or 3 times on the way down it could potentially be the best trade of the month. I dont like it, but I have to take it. And I am getting in late...as in at 12:30am instead of 6 or 7pm because the hourly is clearly in a clean cut down trend.

And as Jack Nicholson used to say:" We trade so you dont have to. We trade so you can sleep all safe and warm at night while we are up battling the forces of evil...the banks. You dont have to like us, but if you dont have anything nice to say, just say thank you and be on your way." Col R. Jessup  USMC

Hi Silat not sure if you are using a EA to indicate the trades but I too missed the GBP/JPY play.

I am using the The7EA trading system from this thread (see attatchment below) but it did not pick it up. Clearly just by looking at the chart and using the7 rules it is a clear play, so now Im wondering how many other plays have I missed and should I go back to visually checking rather than relying on a EA.

Also if the EA is wrong I think it should be removed from the forum, but before anything drastic is done can you guys check it out to see if you got the same problem.

Great system by the way look forward to a long profitable stay in this forum.

Further testing , the fx tester , reveals for the continuation of the trend and a way for re entry time .

When the candle open inside without touching the lower ema and the close outside the upper ema - long set

When the candle open inside without touching the upper ema and the close outside the lower ema - short set

This set up shows the continuation of the exisitng trend .

Also, loading up time is when this occurs.

Failure is also occuring, but this gives entry when missed initially .

Hello, I am using the EA The8EA  started in 14/01/2012   , using ea without change nothing , and I now touch in any trade, no stop loss no take profit, only ea running...

Any strategy in a public forum ..will invite the user( other than the creator ) to add on with the original one !!!

This is according to the user how he  applies/understood  the strategy .

Here is no exception to the above one  !!!

The 50 SMA on daily is only add on , I find  helping to ride with the trend. fx tester.

Applying this tool , may miss  / filters out some of the trade signals.

But in alignment with the trend , the 50 sma enhance the strategy .

What we need ?  Follow the trend and ride till tired ? who !!!

--- 帖子 #881 ---
So Mixter have you weighed the missed tops and bottoms the 7 signals nail that the 50SMA

will not catch, against how it helps you not trade against trends?

That's the trouble with using MA's.  They will keep you from trading the wrong way in a strong trend

but the flip side is you will miss out on the killer tops and bottoms which rack up major pips.

What are your findings?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
You are very welcome. I enjoy helping because so few helped me. And you are one sharp SOB!  Thats right. I didnt tel anyone how to re-enter a trade and avoidf potentially failing ones. Good eye!

I was sick for a few days trying to get all this pain medication out of my system thats why I asked you guys if any of you had "suggestions". Im still sick as a dog but I wil  try to always come back. Some beautiful setups. some even on the second day into the band!!!!  I am short eur/usd. This is just 50-50 but if it drops big we all get plump on this one. I think the eur is ready for a 1 year drop. maybe now, maybe in summer. but eventually. I also am short my favorite pair ands trhat is cad/jpy. I still think the jpm has favors to call in from our fed and they will gladly help.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Haymaker, I use nothing but my eye. Why use an EA for a system so simple, right?

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Hi Silat,

Good to see you back. Sorry to hear you have been sick, get well quickly.

Didn't have the best results last week, got out at break even on a few trades after a couple of days in red and inaction, only to see them moved into what would have been profitabe trades. Lessen learnt, trust the system.

I had a good feeling the JPY crosses would fall this morning ( my indicators were showing extremely overbought ) so I went short on six pairs and picked up over 300 pips in an hour or two. Will wait now for a little retracement before again going short. Not to the rules but could not resist urge to take the trade ,then the profit.

I am getting more excited about this system the more I study it. I will have to learn however, to turn the pc off and not look at it until the next day, because having been a very short term trader, as every retracement in price occurs I have the urge to hit the close trade button. Hopefully time will cure the urge.

Greg

I should amend my post about 50 sma.

For  the add on , the 50 sma is an add on !!! Not for the main system/strategy . ( thanks prosper1 )

You are right about catching the top and bottom, only the 7 system .

After placing the sma , I was hesitant to take trades .( fx tester)

Instead of helping to decide, it acts  as a blocker for the main system .

To catch the missed bot/top, the add on with sma was helpful.

Other than this , nothing more on sma .

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Thank you for your good wishes Ben. I have 15 years of trading ewxperience. I know when I am trading with fear, greed or following the rules to a T. . And even I will do better 80% of the time if I place my trade, which in our system is usually at the open but could be at anytime really. I find if I place my trade and shut my computer I too do much better. I want to share a secret with you. Make sure you dont tel anyone else.

The market is going to end up exactly where it wants, no matter how many of us on this thread over analyze and watch it.

However, if you are watching  after your bets, I mean trades are in to compare, to learn to analyze things, that is BENEFICIAL.VERY!

But if you are watching so you can get out early and you get nervous, that will destroy you.  You have a very self-analytical mind. Im sure you will do well. Here is the question for you Ben you need to ask. Do you want this to take 15 yrs like it did me? Or do you want it to take as short a time as possible? If the answer is b, here is the bad news. Most of the fun we all got into this for in the first place is then gone, because we are just getting in we are done. Not so much fun,right. Well, at 54 yrs old I can give you a guarantee....make 2 or 3 million doing it the way I described and you will have a loooot of satisfaction spendfing that money. More so than the excitement or "juice" of being in action like a poker player in las vegas.(which was my othr prior profession)

I love Paul Newmans quote from Color of Money and he says..........."Money won, is twice as sweet as money earned."  This needs to be given a lot of thought why it is so.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
QUESTION FOR THE THREAD:..Guys, I decided to publish my favorite movie quote on gambling which I believe is the real reason we get into trading. Those who disagree can PM me and I as an ex-professional poker player and gambler in Las vegas will prove it to you. And Id enjoy everyones comments on it. Should be  a fun way to break up the monotony of just exits and entries.

Paul Newman in the movie -The Color of Money-----------"Money won, is twice as sweet as money earned."

Can I have a response from you guys and girls as to why you thing this might be true and how it affected you getting into trading.

Lets be honest. If someone offered  you,  before you ever got into trading and said, Im going to give you 2 choices-Being a Bus driver with pay of $80,000 per year. But your salary will never change.     Or being a professional trader $50,000 per year to start  with no limit or cap. Which would all of you have chosen? And why?

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Reentry aka  Add-on :

An hourly bar to CLOSE above/below the high/low of the signal bar avoids some false entries when there is an opp for rentry/add on .

Sometime this may costs bit more, but this will avoid the pain ...

Example NSD/JPY :  10 jan and 14 jan two opps , but the next day set did not give a say go go ..on hourly close above high of these two days .

And the nsd/jpy is in congestion mode now around 100 pips range between open and close for the past 5 days.

Horzontal line above and below the open and close candles will give  a new  view !!!

Thank You very much for the ''The7 Trading System" because you have handed me a exit strategy and also a brilliant strategy to scale in positions on shorter time frames as i trade daily charts.

Thanx a million !!!

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Good for you Mav. Now you can pay us back by letting us now now and then how you do with it on your shorter time frames. Isnt the simplicity of it just too much.

As an aside to all of you, the best futures system I ever saw that worked for 2 years before it fell apart was one where the vendor never told us where he got the entries from, but he always exited at the breach of the high/low of the previous daily bar. And I saw him make 300%-800% annually depending on which index or commodity he played.

IS THE JPY CRUMBLING AGAIN?

I almost forgot why I came here. I was doing really really well in all my positions in the jpy pairs when suddenly these last 2 hrs the JPY is crumbling. I may get in early on some of these JPY  shorts setting up. WATCH!    I told you I felt the USA owes Japan a big favor for buying up 60 billion in bond or 600 billion.

TIP OF THE DAY #2: STOP THINKING.

Please look at the daily chart of AUD/CHF. that is my second favorite pair because its made me more money than any pair.How did I miss this short? Answer: I didnt. What I did do was look  a few bars to my left, saw this nice fat almost engulphing bar in a rising trend and then,perfectly, 2 dojis," another doji type bar" for a very nice entry without having too much risk, followed by 2 or 3 small consolidating type bars. Perfect,right? The only problem was I "thought" that it just consolidation for a coninued new high. It was easy to see......"I thought."

WTF!...this system is based on cutting that out of us. Now Im not saying to blindly follow the system but yes, you should when the R/R/ is so huge,a nd we all know, that bases easily break in both directions, regardless of prior direction. period!

This puppy could drop another 200 pips in 2 days ,no problem. But how many of you took this? I say none. Because we all had our S/R lines on the chart and supply and demand fihured in and 50 moving averages to guide us, and if you gavwe me that chart 1000 times, I give you my word, with this system, you would be sought after by every hedge fund in the country within 2 years. IF YOU ONLY TOOK THOSE KIND OF PLAYS. I GUARANTEE IT. I HAVE THE STATS TO BACK IT UP!

So what is the lesson of the day for you guys? Me, I need to vomit a little more and then if I dont take 3oxys for my back pain and pas out, I may consider this a valuable lesson learned.

I'd like some comments. Beginners, fib players, guitar players anyone!  LOL

I think most of the others would not mind. But, please if you do, start every single post with bolded OF TOPIC-7 SYSTEM S/D/ VARIATION STRATEGY  so beginners here dont walk away in confusion. I woulodnt mind giving it a try....for a while. This thread is dying anyway. But Id want ben and paul to do most of the posting if all of you are ok with that soi it doesnt take us off track from the meat of our system.

Ahhhh..and if you bold it in red or another color, we'll know right away its not the 7 system.

Or........start a separate thread,id enjoy looking at it.

@Silat50

I can't really share my system because i have learned that you should never ever give away your edge if you wanna survive in any business especially this business but i'll definitely share some ideas which i believe people who really wanna trade will understand immediately.

Entry :  Nothing is better than price action nothing at all. I have entered 50+ times in the last 2 years (on daily charts scale in positions not included) using price action + my edge and have lost only 3 times
My other edge which i am willing to reveal because i literally stole it is Scaling in positions on 4 hour then 1 hour and finally 15 min charts when retracements occur but you have to be very intelligent because the positions i scale in also help me minimize losses on losers substantially .

In terms of price action what i do is enter near the levels of S/R and use Japanese Candle Sticks to read Supply and Demand at those levels + my edge which kinda filters quite a few fakeouts. The thing is some people like do trade patterns as well but i just like Japanese Candle Sticks because it fits perfectly with my edge and therefore i don' need to learn chart patterns and other stuff. Its like first my edge tells me there might be an entry signal and then i look if its happening near an support or resistance levels and finally use  JCS to read demand and supply or whether bull/bears are ready to take control.

NOTE: I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK OF MY SYSTEM OR ME AND I WILL NOT TELL YOU MY EDGE NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS WE STEAL MONEY FROM THE STUPID SUCKERS WHO THINK THEY HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
LASTLY, YOU JUST GOTTA TRUST ME NOTHING FEELS BETTER THAN ACTUALLY KNOWING WHAT THE MARKET IS SHOWING YOU SO PLEASE ADOPT A SYSTEM THAT USES PRICE ACTION TO ENTER TRADES YOU WILL FINALLY ENJOY TRADING. WHOEVER SAYS TRADING IS SUPPOSED TO BE BORING IS A LYING SUCKER.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Paul,At the moment I am with Silat and think we should leave the integrity of the system as per the rules in this forum. The original author The7 and Silat50 have obviously had success by adhering to the simple rules of the system. No system is perfect and losing trades are the norm with any system and the relative short time I have been a part of this forum and studying the system, the more entrenched I am with this notion.I have used various indicators with the system in an attempt to filter entries and discarded most of them (Indicators are like systems, they give you good signals but they also give many false ones.)  As stated in a previous post, the additional filters I use are supply/demand (only to show potential areas for correction), a MACD based indicator and an Oscilator that I purchased some time ago.I only enter trades as per the rules, and rely on the oscilators to select the best trades when as often happens, you get more signals than your account or margin can handle. I have also used them to get into a trade early ( before candle close) if their signal is strong and price action is supporting them.The only problem I see with the present rules - and you have posted on this before - is with a continuation of the trend after being closed out, without getting a new entry as per the rules. In my studies, I have seen numerous examples of this and your recent example of the euraud and moreso the eurcad, highlight this deficiency.I feel if we can come together to formulate a set of rules to cover this then we will indeed have the perfect system.I will pm you with a few thoughts and of course Silat would have the final say with any alterations.Gregben

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Greg,

By no means Im not trying to change it, just trying to get a better read on it. Understand there will be losses just trying to minimize them. I like the simplicity of it, its great for entry and picking up trends early. Its the decision making that will help with if the trade is true and which is the best bang for the buck. Just to jump in on every pair that makes a signal will catch up and bite us in the ass. Like i said im new to this and self taught any input or help someone gives me Im all ears. Always looking to learn

Thanks

Paul

Now lets make some money. lol

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Ok i've read every post in this thread and understand the system fairly well now. Just a one thing:

"Closing candle has to open outside the channel to become a valid signal. Let it run until you see opposite signal. Stop Loss is high/low from last candle."

Could anyone explain further the part in bold. I think i understand it, but need to be sure.

I'm still learning. : /

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Nametaker np,

Ex: you have a up candle(green) opened outside the channel and closed inside the channel that's your signal candle. Now the trend continues. Now you get a down candle (red) opened outside and closed inside this would be your opposite signal and to close the trade. As for the stop and loss it is placed at the high or low of the signal candle and is moved to the next high or low of the next closed candle. And continues until you see a opposite signal or the trade gets stopped out.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Excellent, thank you. I understood the opposite signal but wasn't 100% sure, thanks for clearing the two points up.

Does anyone know how long i will be a junior member and not have to have my posts verified?

What a shame that Maverick X cannot see his way to sharing his powerful and secret "edge."

Maverick, try to see this in perspective. In a four-trillion-dollar-per-day market, your "edge" would not represent a blip on blip on the back of a pipette. In fact, even if every trader on Forex Factory traded your edge, it would not register at all in the bigger scheme of things. Get real!

As for not caring what others (your fellow traders) think? Well, that is a subject another forum. Suffice to say that compared to the generous contributions of The7, Silat and in the spirit in Forex Factory in general, your miserliness serves only to dull your "edge."

Better to make no comment than to brag about your sad ethos. May we never see your "edge" lest someone get infected with Scrooge-itus.

___________

In regard to the system I have two small contributions that others might find useful.

Firstly, I have begun trading this system in its original form on 4hr charts, and right across the majors. When I see a setup, I use the PositionSize Calculator to calculate the percentage risk I should assign to my stop loss. I set my risk to 3% and I set my TP to twice (2 x) my risk. To recap, if my risk is 50 pips, my TP is 100 pips. My 50 pip risk is thus calculated to 3% of my equity. TP will therefore be 6% of my equity.

I spend 10 mins X 6 times a day scanning the setups each day. That is 1 hour of trading per day.

Apart from The7's origningal 5EMA setup, I do NOT use Fibs, Pivots, S/R lines or any other trend lines. I know this will cause conjecture, but in my experience, for every pivot/fib/00/ bounce, I have seen a breech -- meaning that when the market approaches one of these famous markers, you never know what it will do until its done. Plain and simple as that. Half the time it will bounce and half the time it will beach.

I therefore ignore them entirely. (I appreciate this is controversial, but all comments are welcome in the context of this trading system.)

I find trading 4hour charts affords many (six times) more opportunities to trade per day, and is as stable as daily charts. At the moment I am achieving a ratio 2:1 win/loss trades with a 2:1 risk/reward ratio. (newbies and not-so newbies, please understand what these terms means. Do your research and your math.) In addition, with more picks in a day, I find my eye is more tuned to good setups and I get to cherry-pick trades.

One negative, I have to get up once a night for 10 mins to do the 4pm shift! Sometimes I just miss it and curse when I see what a perfect setup it was.

I agree, anything less than 4hours will frazzle the mind and your equity will be eaten by spreads.

I have attached two items. (1) the MT4 position size calculator and (2) some light reading "Trading in the Zone" by Mark Douglas.

Tim.

Thanks Tim, excellent post and for sharing your strategy!

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Tim,

keep us updated with the 4hr timeframe, some maybe interested in it. Now with the calculator just input my entry and stop loss?

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Thanks Tim,

I have been reading through a couple of Mark Douglas's books. Very informative.

Im new to all this but studying all the time.

Have i got this system right so far:

1. Look for a signal. Up candle (Blue) has to open outside and close inside.

2. Place a pending order (in MT4). Set the stop loss at the HIGH of the up candle (signal candle) or if down set at LOW of down candle (opposite signal candle).
Not sure about this part. Set buy limit/buy stop etc to current price of last signal candle. Not sure about what to do with take profit either.

3. Follow trend.

4. Close/Exit when see opposite signal (Opens outside, closes inside).

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Correct on all accounts except Set part. Those go with pending orders. What you want to place is either buy stop or sell stop. then it will take the trade when it goes in that direction up for buy down for sell.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
That tempting Eur/Usd trade:

Many of you consider the EUR/USD to be breaking out of a base right now on this bar. But its entry was already trigered. In my opinion those who love the Euro(I dont!) can take that trade and treat it as a new one. So, get in now at 1.3461 with a stop at1.3349. Dont worry, since it is not over extended yet, your computer wont tell the Forex factory cops you bent the system a bit. You are still risking one bar worth of pips to make many.

Disclaimer:This trade should not be done by persons with less than 3 months in this system as it definitely will lead to taking  more and more trades on your own by bending the rules. If you are not a very seasoned traderass! I am a very experienced trader and I am passing.

I only mention this trade because so many of you follow this pair. R/R is reasonable. Again, I am not taking this trade but it should be fun to see if the Euro can really break out. Remember in stocks, 72% of breakouts fail. I am betting its about the same for Forex. Be careful.

Hey ur back feeling better. Staying away from eurusd killed me last week lol

Gbpusd long signaled Friday. Also keep eye on audnzd and cadchf long

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Yes... only input your entry and stop loss and percentage you wish to risk. The value of this calculator forces you to think i percentage of equity at risk, rather than pips at risk. Percentage thinking makes for far better money management. Obvious but true.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Hello, just wanted to say hi, and thank you all for the great info. I have started trialling this system for myself and am finding all the posts incredibly helpful. I took (in my log only) USD/JPY on Friday. Am I correct in saying I shouldn't have, as the candle touched the 5ma on both the upper and lower side? Currently it is ok (by 40pips...), but waiting to see how it all progresses.

Once again, thank for all the helpful info.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Rules state if candle touches both emas then its a no trade. Now with that said some like that big candle others don't. It's up to your preference and how you trade. If you are going to adhere strictly to the rules then you shouldn't of entered the trade. If you saw something else on your charts that may of swayed you to take the trade then ok. It's all about learning and helping each one out. I think it's a very good entry system but I think there is room for improvement for when the trade swings against you and you get stopped out early. And continuation of a trend. Well good luck to you, also in trading discussion forum some other have been listing their choices and observations. 7methods signal thread.

Good luck

Tip of the day #4 CHART READING THE 7 SYSTEM.:

Guys and girls, Rememeber a couple of days ago when that nice size green bar popped thru the top band, I told you that you could take the EUR/USD LONG EVEN THOUGH IT TRIGGERED ALREADY? Well, lets look at what happened so far. If you took it it would be down a tiny few pips at this juncture. But what do you do about that bar to your left? How did those of you who took it, or take any trade that produces a tiny bar for that 1st day, how do you move your stop loss. The answer, which I dont believe to my knowledge 7 ever covered before he was abducted by Afghanni terrorists, is this: YOU IGNORE VERY SMALL BARS!  That is the beauty of this system. It really gives your trade time, to move in your direction, and if tonights bar closes again small, ignore that too. Keep ypour stop under that nice fat green bar which got you in in the first place. When in doubt, dont move your stop.

I would also like to say that I apply that rule when I have so much profit that one 50 or 60 pip mpve would knock me out, i WILL IGNORE THE PREVIOUS BAR AS LONG AS ITS NOT A BIG ONE. But what if the bar before that is huge you may ask. Then you have to move your stop! Or, if you arent comfortable using a tiny stop or leaving a very big one on....close the trade, take your profits, smile and go to the next one.(But from experience I can tell you that while immediately satisfying, you will have those trades that run and run and run, and you will kick yourself. You cant have it both ways. Perfect example of ignoring "get out" bars is on the gbp/usd chart that I think could have been ignored on one or 2 bars or re-entered the next day as the profit was huge and the pair in a free-fall.

In fact, perfect lesson! If you ignored those 2 silly dojis which God gave you as a gift instead of a pullback, youd still be in the trade. Im sorry I cant post these charts but for some reason on marketscope, when I save a snapshot it does so as a cvs file and wont let me export it to FF. Anyone know how to fix that?

Paul and another couple of you that were in that gbp/usd, you should be kicking yourself. Its trades like that one that make your whole month.  SILAT'S RULE OF FINANCE: When you can no longer lose money on the trade, do everything within normal activity to pile up those profits whether its adding 1 or 2 more positions, or....leaving the stop after like a 200 pip gail with a 100 pip locked in profit and dont even touch it until you are stopped for the 100 profit or  you buy that new car you wanted.(almost. lol)

One last chart: NZD/CAD SHORT- This according to 7 is not a playable pair today after it closed red yesterday Why? No body touching the band. But even if it did......IT ISNT A GREAT PLAY. WHY?  This pair is clearly in an uptrend and the best you can hope for is a tiny pullback and make your 50 or 60 pips. The chart just screams LONG! But as of todays open I get in short. Why? The candle opened flat and started heading down immediately so my thopught is, "Ok I have 2 candles of confirmation now, yesterdays, and todays,so far. Im not risking many pips,am I . So even though its reversed on me all night, Im only a 24 pip loser and I have a nice chance because its not exactly in demand or running with energy, if this thing tires, I can pop a nice 2-300 pip winner.

And, and,............and(is that enough and's?) and....................if I really, really loved this thing, say right now, some weird thing starts happening to all NZD PAIRS IN THE MARKET OR NEWS IS PENDING OR MY NOSE HURTS OR WHATEVER, i HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MOVE THE STOP TO THE PREVIOUS BAR.  That is another lesson but if the previous bar has a long wick, I will often place it there because the wick sometimes is just manipulation and even if Im m wrong, it could take 4 or 5 trading days to knock me out if you look at that setup. Look how toppy it is! So it sounds like Im contradicting myself by shorting something I dont even like but that wick gave me an itch and I have been beating this system to deat only taking plays because of a doji or wick. Ok let me make this short. Here is a really good tip for those of you that are not killing it with this system:

Only take trades where there is either a doji or a bar that gave back well over 50% of its gains and left you with a big wick or tail.

I'd BET MONEY THAT TIP ALONE WILL MAKE THE FEW OF YOU i SEE STRUGGLING INTO WINNING TRADERS.

By the way, I love bars that are touching both bands. You usually need  2 or 3,many times 4 days to knock you out of the trade if you are going to lose. How often do you see a big engulphing bar and then see a reverse color one come up next to it.Not often? Go with the odds! I dont recall 7 saying you cant play if the body,not just wicks and sticks and  a non directional bar!) I mean a huge engulphing bar. I  play those all day.  And here is another piece of gold for you giys, if you you see a chart where the last 2 bars actually did have 2 big bars back to back ...........dont trade that for a few days. It almost always means there is an equal sided gang war about to abrupt, lots of chop and back and forth, and only the market makers and short term traders will get any money. Someone tell me Im wrong....(smile)  Ok,thats enough lessons for the month. You guys not yet profitable should print this out and highlight the good stuff.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Paul,

Thank you for the confirmation. I really appreciate the feedback.

Everyone,

Are you working successfully with this system yourself, is anyone else? I am trying hard not to be a sceptic, as I would love to have this system work for me, but everything I have learnt this far has told me that there is not a one system fits all approach. As I say I am testing it and I really want to make sure I test correctly for myself to give this one a fair chance as a lot of people seem to be commenting on it and I assume using it.

I see lots of poeple also commenting on other indicators etc. that they use to confirm The7 approach and I assume that this is up to each individual. But will the system work, if I dont put my own twist on it and work with it purely as ascribed?

Sorry for the many questions and I hope I do not come across as wanting to challenge the system, but I would really like this to work and want to make sure I have all the tools at my disposal to make myself successful at it.

Lors

PS the gps/usd looks like it might be shaping up nicely if I am reading everything correctly. (comments appreciated)

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Lors,

Silat50 makes for good reading I suggest reading some of his posts regarding the system. Indicators are more for the use of helping with continuation and confirmation of the signal. It will help you decide which signal is the stronger and therefore a better trade. Continuation of the trend so you don't lose out. I have tried everything from gurus and robots, can tell you this is a very good system. As long as you stay disciplined and figure what you are most comfortable with.

EGG ON MY FACE TONIGHT:

Do any of you remember just a couple of weeks ago or so, I said I personally will not be going short ANYTHING against the JPY. Why? Because clearly all jpy pairs are in a raging historic uptrend, and most of all the PM  of Japan said himself that he is going to manipulate this currency to fall. When someone with trillion sof dollars tells you they are going to manipulate a stock, or forex pair, or your underwear or whatever so you cant win..............ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD GO AGAINST THAT!

Well......meet the idiot. I went short the gbp/jpy yesterday and was just stopped for a 91.6 pip loss on 1 contract. And im drowning in my nzd/jpy position for which I have 2 contracts.  Lets have a hand for Silat, THE FOOL OF THE WEEK!

Let us all learn  a lesson from this rediculous blunder. This was my biggest mistake of the year. Paul says you need filters. Well, if the PM  of Japan telling you hes not letting the yen go up not the best filter you ever got in your life, I dont know what is. But yuh know what people....it would hurt twice as much if those trades were not in the system requirements.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
IM LONG AUD/USD:

After that doji and now an engulphing bar, I think this could be the best play of the week! Especially if you notice, most AUD pairs are looking to turn and its brother the CAD is leading it!   Look for lots of plays to trigger on the cad pairs and the AUD pairs. I will be in 1/2 of em. If we lose we lose.  Since its pulling back in the asian session you can even get into the aud/usd now, and for the super aggressive of you, add another lot after it breaks the high of the day or previous day....whichever is higher!!!!!  (Silat rule #6423 on page 94 of the manual.)  lol

Folks,

Please forgive me for posting this chart here, but  a couple of you have emailed me privately asking for my take on Harmonic fibonacci trading and I wanted to show you the charts and software I use for it. If anyone has any backtesting experience with the 4 main set ups and can give me stats, please contact me by PM. i AM ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN 4 hr and  daily charts as I believe the rest are a  waste of time.

Disclaimer:THIS CHART HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 7 SYSTEM.  I do not currently trade Harmonic patterns like this. Not because they dont work but I have no time or money to spend back testing them over long periods. I am already overwhelmed with the 2 systems Im working on now. I had been at break even with the 4 main patterns after 3 months and got bored with it. If these charts are what others work with ,either with or without the 7 system, PM  me as I said. To those who dont understand  these patterns, it is saying the GBP is going up. 1st tgt is the 2nd triangles highest peak. 2nd target is the 1st triangles even higher peak. I wish I had another place to post it but you guys wouldnt see it.

Personally I wouldnt trade the 7 system for harmonic trading for anything. One is completely rigid, the other(the 7) allows you to pick and choose and even eventually tweak it.)

[SIZE="3"]Also I am going to be starting another 7 thread in which only I can post initially, and Im going to use it to take ask questions and take polls. I think it will be an incredible way to learn. I shall keep you all posted.[/size]

Hi, I have been reading all the posts and really trying to take everything in, and I have noticed that this system (as with most in trading) is cyclical and has its good times and bad. I dont know if you are able to help, but hope that you can. Are we currently in a 'good' period for the system. I only ask as I have only done one week of testing but have made over 500 pips, and in an ideal world I would like to test further, but both Silat and Paul seem to be advocates of this, and so it would appear that this may be a system worth going live on, while the times are good. The reason that timing is so important is that I do not want to go live at a lean time and then get put off and say that this just didn't work. I appreciate that this post is not directly related to the system, but would appreciate feedback. After this post I promise trade related posts only!

Lors,

I like the simplicity of the system and it works for me. I'm comfortable with it and do live trade with it. Going live is up to you. You have to be comfortable and confident with the system to go live. Get a game plan with the system try it out demo wise and then once your confident with it then go live. It's up to you no one else lol. Good luck!

2 PROBABLE SCENARIOS ON THIS GBP/USD short-

1-It just wafles around leaving 2 small box like bars with half the size made up of wicks and stems. (No,not Guns and Roses, that's a band.) Slightly bullish and it gains 25-45 pips over next 2 days. If that happens,I am NOT moving my stop. I want them to take me out if the REAL bar. They are not taking me out with an 80 point wick and then crumble down 350 pips. You guys CAN PLAY BY THE RULES AND SHOULD.

2-It just starts dropping like a rock right from the open. For me the open is 6:30. The volume is too low to even see the daily bar till then sometimes.

Im not moving my bar down until significant action has taken place. I will wait two days. That is nt just another ordinary bar, that bar is the pivot of the entire move down, the most pronounced push the bears have give this whole run some of us have been in already. I'd study the chart and see how I could have captured most of that down move by maybe staying in one bar a little over the band and re-entering on another bar when it turned red after going past previous days low of prior green bar. We must study trends like this and try to see how max dollars could have been extracted from them...and then maybe leave the system and start our own once we can. My door is always open for fresh ideas.

Silat50,

Re: Continuation entries.

See below part of email sent to Paul in late Jan which relates to your latest post

The biggest deficiency as I see, and you have posted on this, is after

getting stopped out of a trade you get a continuation of the previous trend

without showing a re-entry as per the rules. I have attached a couple of the

same charts to highlight this for your consideration, and will welcome your

thoughts as the best way to formulate a rule on these continuation trades.

It goes without saying that you will have had ( if taking the signal) a

losing trade prior to this continuation setup, and it would depend on your

exit strategy as to where it is best to re-enter. I have mentioned 3

different scenarios on the chart, break of high/low resulting in loss, close

outside the bands or a break and close over/under resistance/support.

Example: If you are closed out of a winning trade with a close of candle

inside the bands and enter a trade in the opposite direction that gets

stopped out without having a candle close outside the opposite band then:

(a) Re-enter in original direction if price breaks above the most recent HH

or LL

or

(b) Re-enter if a candle closes above/below the bands in the direction of

the winning trade ( My favoured)

or

(c) Re-enter if a candle closes above/below a support/resistance line formed

since the closure of the winning trade.

Another couple of points for your thoughts.

Notes (1) on chart.

If a candle has a close just outside the band (very close), therefore not

giving an entry as per the rules, and price breaks into the band, you may at

your discretion enter the trade based on price action.

and

Note(2)

Do not move original stop before (a) 3 candles have completed

or (b) 100 pips in profit

then (c) Move stop to high

low of last candle and continue doing this till stopped out or manually

closing trade at desired TP

Have a look back at some charts and see what you think of these 2. (1)

allows for an aggressive entry and with (2) I have noticed that after a

reversed signal many times there is a period of congestion with price

whipsawing that would take out stops if moved too quickly.

Look forward to your reply,

Greg

Ahhh God you see that. When and more importantly "if" you should re-entry is what is going to take the longest work, back and forward testing for this system. But yes, I agree, it is very important. I hope you read my analysis for the GBP/USD trade I took tonight because that is a perfect example. And yes, why should I get in on a huge bar and then because of 2 small pull back days not have enough room to let this trade run and get stopped out.  On the other hand because yopu are starting off with so much more room than usual, why not take 2 trades. One at the high of the candle and then one about 1/2 way down which is still plenty of room.  And again on that one where you taske less risk by setting stop only 1/2 way up, you can also  not get in right away and put a sell stop under the lowest candle of the swing 15658, 5-6 candles away. Then you cover the whole pivot and maybe even the whole area. But this trade has an unusuallly large size candle so we must prepare from more normal situations too. Yes, I like that chart you provided. I will give it a good look over during the off hours and get back to yu.

Thanks Greg. Great work!  I would like to at some point have an exact system we follow to do re,entries with no guesswork because one bad day can cost the whole month when you let in guesswork as Im sure weve ALL found out. But yeah, this system has more power than we think by 1- not moving the stop too soon and 2- learning when to re-enter.

REAL MEN SHORT EARLY:

Paul, now youre getting into that cad short? you should have been in and out twice already.  when you saw those 2 spiking bars at the very top, you sit your whole family down and go "look, you see these 2 pins that look like upside down thumbtacks?" they all go "yeah....so?" you then say...."TAKE MY MOUSE UNCLE PHIL. sCROLL OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS OF US CAD CHARTS. LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU FIND 3 OF THEM TOGETHER LIKE THAT" Then you go take a nap. Now you come back 45 min later and uncle phil is ready to rip the eyes out of your head." What is this nonsense???? So...I looked for 24 months and never doers that pattern happen 3 times. now what?" you sit uncle phil back down and say, well...your nephew paul is about to make us all very rich. take all the money you and your bbothers have in the bank, and we are going to short this thing as soon as it breaks thru one of those black bands. uncle phil you cant lose,because as you saw, it never happened any other time. so " so uncle phil and his 3 brothers get 2 or 3 mill in a brokerage acct managed by you and you short all their money. say 20 full size contracts on  usd/cad. then the next day all of them come to your house and watch the action. you tell your uncles...."Im going to take a nap, wake me up at 5pm or when this daily bar passes another bar. "why,dont you want to sit and watch with us.?"  you gotta play thius cool, paul. so you go............"naaaaaahhhh, I did this 5 times already. I already know where its going to close." and then you go into your room, take the mirror and all the herbal festivities out from under the bed, and you start smoking,toking and 8 balling till the day is done.. then, you  slap yourself in the face a few times to pretend you were alseep, and you very boredly ask..........so where did that bar finish today ,uncle?  Then bend over...stick your head _______. and pray he gives you any answer on the earth but one " a little higher than the last candle. is that good?"

Lol between you and silat with these anologies. Had usdcad short on 1/29 got stopped out at the end of week. it maybe bouncing off of the 50 fib and then hopefully goes back to the downtrend.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
I have taken Silat's tip and entered short both GBPUSD and GBPAUD. I will add to the position if it retraces say 40/50 pips. Both of my filters say that this downward trend has potential to fall much further. Time will tell!!!

I am also going to take an aggressive ( not by 7 rules ) short trade on the GBPJPY if/when it crosses below the upper band. The stop above the high will only cost about 40 pips so worth the risk.

My reasons for the trade:

(1) My filters support the trade

(2) The Pound is extremely weak against all other crosses and it is only the Japanese's governments desire for a weaker yen that is supporting this pair. I am hoping that this pair will align with the other crosses and head south. Worth 40 pips risk.

Hi

i don't want to disappoint you for short GBPUSD entry but this level is not OK it's better waiting to get the Daily Resistance of Last week then open short position without stress 1.5865/85 this area is very good for short and collect T/P around 1.5530 till the end of week for AUDUSD 1.04520/35 is ok for short position cause it must go toward 1.0383

Hey Guys

GREGBEN

I stumbled across this site by accident.

I have not read the thread or the entry rules as I have my own system I trade similar but differant. I'm actually replying to a comment made earlier by gregben. No entry for a 1000 pips I beg to differ, you could have been in most of the trade if you followed price. I have attached a screen shot with my entry and exit rules.

As mentioned earlier I do not know your entry or exit rules and I only trade the H4 and the GJ isn't one of the pairs I trade, however the oppertunity was there to collect additional pips quite a few too.

I have a 10EMA high and Low on my chart that I use to trail price one candle back with a buffer below or above the 10EMA, in this screen shot I used a 50pip buffer below the 10 EMA low which I think will be sufficient for a daily chart and resulted in a nice profit of 1226 pips.

It might be worth your while to check it out.

This system works on all TF I really like the EurAud. First TP be realistic and move to BE and the second half follow price for as long as it wants to run and by moving it up everyday you also reduce your risk.

Well I appologise if I have overstepped on someones turf but it is a shame that you lost out on a 1000 pips.

All the best

Jns,

Thankyou for your post.

The chart you refer to was not a trade that I took as I to, only came accrosss this thread and system just prior to Xmas. What it was for ( the chart) was to show in backtesting what I believed to be a deficiency in the original system when you are closed out of a position only to see a continuation of that trend without presenting another entry as per the original.

A few members of this forum are in the process of trying to update and formulate new rules to make this an even better system.

I will study your method when time permits, and may even find it has merit and be used in any rule changes that may occur.

Regards,

Gregben

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Thanks JNS. I was trying to infer the complete body of your rules from the chart you attached but I appreciate outlining them explicitly. How long have you been trading your system? Does it have a solid track record? Performance?

Thanks!

QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP:

Guys and girls, I dont spend time here to lecture and give advice although it seems it has turned into that for the moment. I really am here to hear all of your opinions. (there are no facts in forex)  wWhat will make my day is to hear anyone,even a guyt with 2 weeks experiewnce start his post with-----" I cant believe what I discovered on the daily chart this week."

Those moments are what we as traders should all live for. So let me ask all of you, both visitors, lurkers and regulars alike a few interesting questions. I'd really appreciate if you ALL  took the time to answer, because its like Im telling you what I myself need to learn. And if you see these questions in 9 months from now or 9 years.....you can still answer them.They will always be valid.

#1-If I were to say something is "off" or has changed the way the pairs trade these last 2 weeks it would be that_______

#2-If I could learn tell the difference between one thing when reading charts that would really increase my success.... it would probably be_______

#3-Is it me who's crazy, or has the market really________ ????????

NOW THIS IS A QUESTION WE MUST HAVE SOMEONE ANSWER FOR US. IT IS NOT AN OPTION. WHO WILL VOLUNTEER TO GIVE US 200 OR MORE EXAMPLES.

In our system, we all have one thing we do in common regardless which pair we play. We wait for bar close on the daily. What we definitely need to know as Ive noticed it in my joking with Paul in the USD/CAD.    And it appears it is working in the majority of cases.....IN "THIS" SYSTEM. GETTING IN ON THE BREAK OF THE BAND BEFORE THE BAR CLOSES. ThTA SEEMS MUCH MORE PROFITABLE, AND ALSO SEEMS WHEN THE TRADE DOESNT WORK OUT, YOU ARE EVEN  A SMALL WINNER OR A TINY LOSER AS YOU RACKED UP 60 OR 70 PIPS "before" you even officially get in.

So the question is: Should we get in on the break of the band, not on the close of the daily bar!!!!!!!?

But this has 2 answers.-#1 We need to look at it on very big bars where it had a start of  25 or more pips on the outside of the band before even getting in, bars that are almost all body, no tail, and what about bars that have a huge wick on a short setip but the body is just forming or is still small?   #2-What if the bars are just average normal size bars, will it leave us enough wiggle room to avoid getting stopped.?

I think the bar that got us in on the usd/cad is a perfect example, a perfect bar to get in on......."especially when the bar before it is weak!"

I am nowe thinking that since this will take months to go over every scenario, I may try this for now........get in on solid bars that are turning into large or giant bars with 2 bonditions....there cannot be a strong ie-engulfing bar in the opposite direction before it, and  there has to be at least 25 pips of room to the high of the day so one bad hourly bar doesnt throw us out. And if the wick is very big ,it must be a truly bearish looking cablse(if going shortZ) or you just wait longer or wait till bar close. In other words.......you dont have to jump right in 5 pips after it crosses a band, you can wait 15 min or even an hour.(remember the probability is there is big momentum and we cant wait "too" long")

Id also add in the rule that you cannot take this trade unless you see the bar visibly moving, even if its on an hrly bar. DO NOT USE 5 MIN CANDLES PLEASE!~LOL   WE WANT TO GET IN "WITH THE BIG BOYS, NOT RIGHT AFTER THE MOVE WHEN ITS RESTING OR STALLED!

i WILL START USING IT WITH REAL MONEY But micro pips and report back to you guys. NOW i NEED SOMEONE TO BACK TEST IT TOO. 2 OR 3 OF YOU DOING DIFFERENT PAIRS WOULD BE AWESOME AS iM SURE THE RESULTS FROM PAIR TO PAIR WILL NOT BE THE SAME.

But what happens if I get in and then it reverses a little bit and I close even or a small loser for the day, where should i leave my stop, you may ask. If the current bar is too tightsma//, use the previous bar. that one too small? use the bar before that one!  Thats how I avoided getting into this usd/gbp as yet as im waitng till the low of 5 bars ago to be broken. I told all of you it was an option.But yes im double lotted in the gbp/aud short.

So answer these and lets see who volunteers. Come on guys, We are a very small team here. We cant afford for even one of you to not contribute. I mean look at that fellow who was nice enough to start a second thread for us to post our trades, and he is not even that active here. Everyone has to chip in!

I am very, very excited about the results of what this will turn up. Besides, isnt it a lot more fun(though riskier) to get in while something is in motion than when the train is sitting still at the station at 5-6 pm?  -)

For Walad:  We are a laid back bunch. You ask so many questions at once. lol    I will answer in bulk by saying this thread was started by a gentleman who no longer is here. None of us have been doing this system very long. Yet out of the 5or 6 active people here, most oif us have a lot of expperience in testing and/or screen time. And  no..................nobody is stupid enough to leave a 1000 pip stop. We all know to use common sense here and we PM each other if we have questions as we are all here and we want people here for one reason:::::: TO LEARN!  BUT WE ARE ONLY ABOUT PERFECTING THIS SYSTEM.  Welcome to the thread. And if you want proof, the best you will find is the snapshot of me having 13 winning trades open at once with this system. Scroll down about  a month. We don't brag a lot here and yes, soon I will encourage everyone to put up trade explorers. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Look at the eur/usd. Perfect,perfect example of my last post. if we all got in short at the crossing of the band,wed be up 70-77 pips alread and the day isnt over yet! Its only 12:13. And yes, after 11:45am you shouldnt fear getting in if there is stalling as everyone is at lunch or went home.

We must really look into getting in at  the band crossing instead of waiting till bar close/days end.  And in fact, thats a new money mgmt method right there. Why not get in at band cross, and also after bars close. If you cant do it, you saved money in one way because it means the trade reversed on you, and if you can have the regular stop loss and another one where you got in if it really ran away. oR USE THE DAY BEFORES BAR CLOSE in extenuating conditions or circumstances.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
I hear what your saying but take a look at eurusd 1/15 engulfing candle and then 1/18 dark cloud cover candle. Now if we entered on the norm of the 7 criteria for short we lost. Even if you were like me and used the low of the signal for entry as opossed to the close, still a loss. Thats why I use other indicators to come to a conclusion if its good or not. As for not waiting for the close and jumping in at the break of the band there must be another indicator in play. Any indicator you use during the daily tf is more useful for the close of the candle. If dropping down to the 4hr tf and using say macd above or below the 0 line to help with the decision when it breaks the band. That i think is the first thing to consider(indicator) and using it from the lower tf. As for entry are we going to use say 50 pips or use the high or low of a previous candle. As for backtesting just taking a look to see if the lower tf helps, if it does then the indicator then the entry method. Look at the euraud same thing. thats my spin on it. I think its worth a look but also both pairs were at the top of the fibo and look to be retracing.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Silat50,

I agree with you that in many instances we will get a better entry point using a cross of the band, but I agree with Paul that some indicator would have to be used as a filter.

That being said, it defeats the purpose of why I was drawn to this thread, that is, only taking trades once a day at a set time ( or close to it ) and not being tied to sitting in front of the screen all day.

I am willing to do some backtesting and as I used to mainly trade the EudUsd and EurJpy I will look at those 2 pairs.

As you said if we all do our bit to improve the system it is to everyones benefit.

i havent read the previous posts, so i dont if you guys realised a shorting oppurtunity on nzd/jpy ?

dark cloud cover on the daily. red bearish candle closing within the 2 emas.

just waiting for a signal to short on the lower time frames..

With yuh on this one. I will feel much better if we can break thru 77.00 pretty quickly.

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Gregben,

It could be an option for people if they wish to use it. I like the simplicity as well and checking once or even twice a day works for me to. But with that said adding another alternative to enter a trade maybe beneficial to some. I'm looking to recognized mis-signals. And if this other alternative signal for entry looks better than a regular signal that could be a potential bad one, I'll take the alternative. I'll play around with some random pairs as well

Aud/Nzd is looking better on weekly and monthly wise.

Weekly/monthly 50 ema is well above the price .

weekly already shows the signal .

Nearest support bases are broken on weekly as well monthly .

Aug 2011 support base 2300 ++ is holding now .

As per the strategy , the daily add-on /renetry got triggered already  .

Nsd/jpy seems to looking for 82.30 area . weekly is well above the upper band , so , no trace for sell as of today.

78.50 resistance is holding this pair now. seems , will pass that hurdle ...

One thing I noticed , if there is a signal triggered from the inside bar formation, it  may not go well !!! Gbp pairs ..

POST 942 question#3-  Id like to add to my answer. I noticed today that the GBP.USD which I know for a fact many of you on this thread follow with great interest, had some very unusual trading and nobody caught it. We had the largest hourly volume between 11-noon.

Are they kidding me!

These weird spurts of volume Ive been noticing it,mostly subconsciously, just leapt out at me today. It tells me something that MAY be very important. WE HAVE A CHANGING OF THE GUARD.

Traders dont live forever, and old traders dont trade forever. New traders who have a good run of 3 or 4 years at a firm controlling billions have one or 2 bad qtrs and they are gone. New guys from Harvard,M.I.T., and the best colleges in America have wanna be hotshot traders pounding on the doors of every big trading bank and hedge fund every day. I see by the change in the times the money flow is coming in, ......some of them are making it thru! Good for them. I love success, I love new winners. The world is tired of watching the same faces on tv YEAR AFTER YEAR GIVING US FIANNCIAL NEWS,THEIR WAISTLINES AND BOOB JOBS SAGGING MORE EACH YEAR. MOVIE STARRS WHO HAVE MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THEIR 60'S ARE STILL MAKING ACTION MOVIES AND RUNNING AROUND LIKE THEY WERE STILL 33.

Time for the new. In all things. ESPECIALLY MY KEYBOARD THAT ALWAYS GETS STUCK ON CAPS AND i TRY TO BE COOL AND PRETEND i WANTED THE WHOLE MESSAGE THAT WAY.(smile) Sorry folks.

Anyway, it used to be all the money came in  the same 4 hours 4 out of 5 days a week. 3-5am in London and 8-10AM in NY. You could be a day trader and work those 4 hours and make more than all the traders working the other 20 hours.  its changing. I watch the Asian session know and see a bar complete half of its daily size by 10pm on so little volume I have to stretch my screen to see the volume bars! ARE THEY KIDDING ME! And then it holds up all night and day? WTH????????

Keep your eyes open boys and girls. I think the rotation of the new coming in and the old with their golden parachutes and paid off Beach houses and Villas who want to just relax and  F%$k all day,which lets be honest, if you traded  that kind of money successfully for several years, you desereve that life. Its what draws many of us here. So....keep your eyes open people and let me know what other "quirky" wierd things you see going on here and there that just cant be accidental. I cant wait for ther next black swan event. These markets have really gotten soooooooo boring to watch. I almopst pity the day traders who put in 8 hrs straight of screen time a day...especially in the asian session. OMG!

lETS SEE WHAT THE NEXT 2 OR 3 MONTHS SHOWS US AND MOST IMPOIRTANT, HOW WE CAN ADD IT TO AND TWEAK THE 7 SYSTEM WITH OUR NEW FINDINGS. I AM NOT EVEN MENTIONING SEVERAL OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REALLY OFF LATELY.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
THE GBP/AUD/  GBP/USD TRADES. Guys, look at what I wrote about on these trades. You see what I am talking about now,right?. We aren't even really going anywhere with either trade yet and already we are able to move our stop down to todays close/high and we took off 75 pips of risk in the GBP/USD.

This is the beauty of the system. Time always works in our favor. If you would up in the hospital an hour from now, and you came home 2 weeks later and saw you were still in the trade, you could be 90% sure you racked up huge,huge gains in these 2 trades............by doing nothing!

FOR THE NEWBIES ESPECIALLY,AND I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THIS....WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE 7 SYSTEM IS PERSONIFIED IN THIS TRADE. WE START OFF MAYBE 50-50 TO WIN. BUT...WE ALSO START OFF OVER 100-1 FAVORITE TO NOT GET STOPPED OUT THE FIRST DAY.(I EXPLAINED WHY IN ANOTHER POST)

If someone asked me what MY objective is as a trader using this system. I would say, its is not to win money. It is to not get stopped out the first day. If we are still alive after day 1, 80% of the time we are in profit or our risk got very small. (smile)

What more can you ask for in any system? If this system was a woman, I'd marry it.

Guys,

Most people dont brag about their losing trades, but that is often where the learning experience is. Lets go back to the GBP/USD short. We were officially stopped out on the second day for a loss of about 110-115 pips.

BUT I LOVE IT!  It is over 100-1 to get stopped out on the first day, so all we had to do is make it one more day. I told all of you. Every trade I take I look at it in packs of 100. I say to myself "If I take this trade 100 times will I be a winner." If my edge is so small Im not sure after 100 trades which is a small sample to be sure, I usually lose interest and dont take the trade. In any system! But this trade was a clear yes. So I saY GIVE ME THIS TRADE 100 DAYS IN A ROW. And I am almost sure I will be a rich man in a fairly short time.  In fact I re,entered the trade as this trades original hig, for it top be broken would to me, signify a whole new trend. What is another 100 pips risk to have the whole trend on your side.

GBP/AUD -Same idea. But I just re entered right now because the origiunal stop was only about 23 pips away. I just took triple my normal position and I am getting at least 20-1 odd on this IMHO. i EITHER LOSE 23 pips or I make 460 pips with no problem. Give me these odds all day.

Remember guys when doing your backtesting, they say to throw out the best and worst trade to get a more true result and I go with that. But...you still need to use those 2 trades at some point because as I keep telling you all. 80% of your profits per yeat will come from 20% of your trades. Maybe 5-10%!  You cannot afford to miss them.

Do any of you remember the time you were following a system in day trading and had lost 4 or 5 trades very quickly and you were really disgusted and when the next trade came you said "Ahhhhh let me see how this one does first before I lose any more money, and that trade exploded and kept you in not only all day, but for 2 or 3 days if you hold overnight and would have made your whole week if you just took the trade.

I remember those times clearly. So my suggestion to those who are losing badly and wont take the next trade: TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER AND TAKE A BREAK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. IF YOU ARE A SWING TRADER LIKE WE ARE HERE, TAKE A WHOLE WEEK OFF! BUT never, never let the market break it off in your a%$S, by making you watch a winner go by.

And yes, whom ever is trading binary, let us know once in a while how this system is holding up for you. I thought binary trading was only for the day or limited periods. I know in the USA and most countries it isnt offered. Its big in the UK.

Why we always miss the best trades:

Those of you who know me from the past, know I am always saying its the trade you really dont want to take that causes you the most sorrow. And those of you who know me from this thread know I have done well with this system. But I have an advantage over some of you. I SPENT YEARS LOOKING FOR REVERSALS AND LOOKING FOR PIVOT POINTS WITHIN PIVOT POINTS. So this system was made for me because Im used to its rules.

I must say, with all the hoopla and BS  aside, even I, am missing the best trades. And I am making the most basic beginners mistake to cause this. And that is there are certain currencies I "know" are weak, so whehn they give a buy signal I ingnore them. I have news, very bad news for you all.....so do most of the retail players,regardless of system they  use, and the big boys eat us for breakfast. Example. Look at the daily CHART OF gbp/chf shown here. The buy signal was triggered yesterday. I will bet money that not one of you took this signal. And I will say its 3-1 in my favor not more than 1  or 2 of you did if anyone really did....for real money! Why? The trend is clearly down,right? It cant go up. Pluus it made a lower low while setting off the signal to buy. Is this insane? But thats why the system knows better than us. For me I skipped it because I "know" the GBP is weak. I know the SWISSY is strong against almost every currency now. Those 2 combinations assure me that this is a losing trade, right?   So I saw the setup.....and passed! Now look at what pops up the day after the trigger. The most delicious engulfing bar you can imagine. I like these by the way over much bigger ones because the really over sized ones often then waste 3 or 4 bars pulling back.These kind  tend to be a launching pad for more immediate gains.

And now that I look at this chart, there is no resistance anywhere on thios chart. To see this go back to its high of 1.5000 looks well within reach before getting stopped out.

The bottom line is this...when you often skip a trade, you usually forget about it and dont come back to check to see how it really did. Well guys and gals....THIS ONE IS IN OUR FACE! WE HAVE TO EAT IT ,NOW!

Moral of the story: Play what is on the chart not in your head!

This is a great example of why the smart "old timers" who say psychology is 90% of trading  have no clue. You could have a flawless ability to stock to your plan and have no fear, but if you eliminate the trades that rack up the most gains, youll always be mediocre at best because you are following your brain, which is often following the herd...which is often going straight off the cliff, rather than following the charts.

As an aside, I saw 10-12 trades in the last 2 weeks just like this and no one ever said they were in those trades. That is why this game is so much harder than people think. You are so often acting counter-intuitive. Would we have many boxers in the world if their trainers trained them to walk into their opponents face with their hands down at their sides, even if that trainer was the best in the world. NO!

As my psychologist friend once told me- "The problem with human beings is that  we so often want what is no good for us."

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Sorry I forgot to give you guys the chart I was saying is a great lesson to us all. Would anyone had taken the trade before that big engulfing bar of yesterday? No way!

Hey Silat,

Lol I know but you can't get everyone. Unfortunately I did have it long on paper. Been busy so haven't been around. And they only reason I didn't take it had two others that were better. And closed in profit. It's about time felt like a hitter in a slump lol. Gbpusd panned out but the gbpaud didn't glad I didn't get in. This is why you need other indies to help with decision making stocholastic making a W around the oversold area. But hey whatever if we were never wrong we would never got married, lmao. Ok got to get ready for the blizzard. To to you soon.

There will always be a lot of false signals. The key is to find a system where it doesnt matter. As for me, I found this system where almost every single pair was giving off huge winning signals tallying up 3,4,500 pip gains before getting stopped. How many systems can ever do that ,that you will find for free on an open board like this? This system is not for everyone. Most of the people here use it with their own indicators. I use it with my "eyes" for indicators. The one thing about this system that works for everyone(or you arent playing this system!) is that it always limits your losses to one bar. Lose a little, make a lot.

I dont know what this has to do with the price of eggs,as the saying goes, but I have also been using a 60 min bar system aside from this ,lately. And it is amazing how I can spot tops and bottoms, exhaustion bars, you name it, all kinds of patterns........AND ON THE DAILY BAR(S) THEY DONT EXIST!

It is so interesting. I will see a pattern on say the 60m  usd/jpy and I am positive it has topped out. A solid green bar shows up, then gets taken out by an equal size red bar, and then a second red bar forms. And this is after an 8-10 bar long run. I then look at the daily bar and all I see is a solid green bar. The wick is so small I have to zoom in to see it. What does that tell us?

As an aside, if you get addicted to watching 60 min bars on the london, trade like I do, and you dont have a job, you may never be able to work a regular job again. It is soooooo ADDICTING.  -)

To quote my own post....I remember sitting in a trading room with a professional trader who was sort of my mentor, he made a comment I should never forget, but too often do:

"If you want to go short something on a 60 min time frame or less, you better see at least 1/2 the daily bar disappear into a wick or you are going against the daily trend and you will NOT be a winner at the end of the year,no matter what  you do."

I guess,because my one "tendency" that has cost me the most money, is seeing tops that arent really tops on smaller time frames, I am really glad to be trading THE SEVEN SYSTEM.

If all of you asked yourself, what is the one thing I keep doing over and over that costs me money, if you cant answer it....Its costing you  a LOT of money. I believe even the best traders in the world have at least one bad habit or trading rule that eats away  a lot of their profit,they just dont see it.

Question of the day:  If the system Im using works, why am I still working?

Hi Silat

Do you mind posting a screen shot relating to the top comment.

Hi traders,

According to the strategy the EURUSD Daily should be a nice buy signal with SL at the bottom of last candle that will close in 3h right?

Thanks for your help.

No. It was a nice buy 3 candles ago when the 1st small green candle on your chart closed in the middle of the band. This should be your 3rd day in the trade. I suggest you check your band settings for 5-high, 5 low ema. Or go find the instructions that are pasted at the beginning of this thread. It might be clearer for you,

BACK IN THE GPY/AUD SHORT-Those of you who remember  several days ago I just about wrote a book on why I loved that gbp-aud short. So look what it did. It stopped us out, then 3 days later here comes the short signal again and iM ALL OVER IT. This time, I put one lot on right away and then added another beginning of today. I think one of you should volunteer to keep the statistics of what happens if we lose one trade, what is the result on the second trade going the same direction when it re-triggers? Im almost thinking if the weekly is with you all the way, you may want to figure out how to money manage it, so you put more or less into the 2nd trade depending what the stats show. Its just one of 10 ideas I get every day. No biggie.

Hi The7! How do I know that the signal fulfills?

TAKING A BREAK:

Guys, I need a break from the thread. I cannot make trading my whole life and I'm stepping back a bit from it. I encourage all of you new people to not ask questions every single day as it distracts the older guys who if you just sit back and listen to, you'll get this. If you have any confusion on the rules of this system ,just go back to the beginning of this thread. I will be spending some time re-reading my own posts as well as the others here. Its amazing how we can hear something(or read) 7 times and on the 8th time we "get it."  This is a GREAT SYSTEM. iF YOU USE IT ALONE, FINE. If YOU NEED TO PUT OTHER THINGS INTO IT, PAPER TRADE IT ON YOUR MT4 PLATFORM BEFORE RISKING REAL MONEY.

To repeat again: The beauty of this system is not any magic bands. It is the fact that when you come down to the bottom line, this system is based on 2 things:

1-having a one bar stop loss.

2-Trying to spot sharp reversals or pull-backs with low risk in most cases.

IF ANY OF YOU CAN FIND A BETTER MONEY MGMT SYSTEM THAN THIS, Please, post it here and let us know!!! We are all here to learn. We are not married to this or any other system. But this is about the best Ive found on FF in years. What more can you ask for than a system that has a one bar stop loss?    I applaud the guy that invented it.

Caution: So far, no one has proven this system to work profitably except on daily bars. And why give more spread to the market makers anyway. Stick to daily bars and only daily bars. But use your brain to decide WHICH pairs you play when they give a signal.

The sore spot of the system: So far, we have not come up with an exact strategy as to when to re-enter the trade when you get knocked out on a multi bar win. We also havent decided if adding to the trade is more profitable than not. These are critical components in my opinion that we all need to work on together. As Ive proven to you guys with just my last trade I posted in GBP/AUD, and others I have posted here or PM'ED OTHERS ABOUT, i HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS,ADDING ONTO THE TRADE....But I am the last one top say I am sure this will continue. Lets keep up the research,boys. And thank God we discovered this system because even if we find something better, I bet money what we have learned from using this will stay with us for life. I hope I am always returning here again and again, for all my life.

Be back soon.

ONE MORE THING:

All of us should be keeping records of when we lose a trade...what could we have done to make it into a winner, even if the rules are outside the 7 system. Lets share this info! nAnyone can talk about a winner. But you LEARN.....from your losers!

Later.

Hello folks. Big apologizes to every one of you for not being active for a very long time. I was and am very occupied with my personal, specially professional life. The Real Estate Market here in beautiful Vancouver, BC is about to collapse and I am trying to be prepared for the future.

It's awesome to see that some of you made a use of this system. I did not have any chance to read most posts yet but there is something I like to outline: No system is perfect. Sometimes everything, every system works, until it, well, doesn't anymore.

The 5EMA channel is a very good indicator to hold a pulse of the market. Watch it carefully. Watch for wicks, retraces and follow the channel. Round numbers, S/P levels are crucial. Duringtimes when this system will fail, all others will do the same.

Welcome back The7,

Question: what is your opinion of running this system on 4hour charts... or even one hour charts for that matter?

Many thanks,

Tim.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Нi all. At lower TF lot of false signals.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Thanks for checking it out. Better to stay with the daily less checking the charts so not to be tied to your computer. Less whipshaw. Easier to cherry pick trades. Dont get me wrong you will get false signals in daily but using other indicators to help weed it out helps. No system is perfect thats why I believe you need other indicators to help with decision process. How i look at it if the first criteria is not met I move on to the next chart til i find it. Then use other indicators to see which has the best potential. And take it from there.

Paul

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Hello Paul! Tell me what indicators to use filtering? I'm bad understand English but I'll cope.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Which ever ones you feel comfortable with and have a good understanding on how to use them. I use Fibonacci levels, candle patterns, stochlastic, zigzag, supply and demand, rsi. Each one helps in its different way and gives me a total picture of the possible trade. But first I look for that candle opening outside the channel and then closing inside. Then seeing what the other indicators are telling me. And which ever pair gives me the best possibilites thats what I go with.

Good Luck

Why the Daily Bars Rule:

I tried andre. 60 min and 4 hr charts for  a long time. It doesnt work. This system is no good for anything but daily charts.

Here is my theory on "WHY".  In a 24hr period many of the 4 hr and 60 min bars have no meaning because there is so little volume on them. So they get mixed into the band creating false signals. But in a daily bar, the big boys are ALWAYS there someplace. Make sense?

I also want to point out that while not part of the system, Im jealous of that long gbp/usd decline and in hind site, this system would work some of the time...but using a 20 moving average would get you the whole move down. Now I will try to get his results but I noticed this because I often keep the 20sma on my chart but also because someone here is trying to use this system by following it exactly until they have enough profit to go to break even, and then they allow the pair a lot more room to run by using the 20ma ot get out, not a break of the band and he has been killing it. I need to find out if nhe is just lucky or if after 3 days of profit, you can do better by moving to the 20ma for your stop. Im not convinced just yet. If anyone wants to back test that and get back to me on  a couple of pairs, that would be cool.UNTIL WE HAVE PROOF......

STICK TO THE RULES THE 7 GAVE US.  -)

--- 帖子 #981 ---
I use support and resistance levels. FIBO show the same levels as the history of. 20sma Make a Difference?

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Andre,j07,

Use what you feel comfortable with and what you like. this will help with confidence in trading and decision making. What works for me may not work for someone else. But support and resistance levels are important and co-inside with fibo levels pretty much. try to keep it simple.

Hi haymaker1.

I would like to ask you - is  it possible to program in your indicator "The7 TS.ex4" to record signals of arrows in 2 additional buffers (2 and 3)? In that case, it will make possibility, through function iCustom, to program dashboard for monitoring of many currency pairs in one window.

In advance thanks for the answer!

Volume rules!

What I came here to mention was I'm  looking at the volume on most of these charts and on the 60min bars where real volume can RARELY hide, WHEN YOU CANT SPOT IT ON THE DAILY, its too small, and 4 hrs as well, the biggest volume bars are producing the smallest bars. That is totally opposite of what happens when a prolonged move ,even of a few days takes place. It is the same to a lesser degree on most of the pairs.SIMPLY, RECENTLY WE ARE GETTING MOVES WITH LOW VOLUME BUT THEY USUALLY ARE FAKE OR SHORT TERM SOMETIMES JUST ENOUGH TO GET YOU IN AND THEY SAY GOOD-BYE. Volume is telling me that for right now: THE BIG BOYS ARE JUST WATCHING....OR HOLDING. This will make playing the 7 system a bit rougher but thank God for that 1 bar loss to keep us safe. As usual as I always claimed the set-ups with big solid engulfing bars are doing the best,.Juts look at the setups where the bar goes they both bands. The success rate on them is stll high and is in fact one of the few setups that I can see that is still dependable at the moment. Problem is because volume is so,so low we are hardly getting any of them. But I am astonished that on the eur/nzd 4hr bars where I "Go hunting for the elephant"WHEN IT DOESNT SHOW ON THE DAILY VERY CLEAR,  as an elephant(institutional volume) the only bar with big volume is some doji,tiny hammer-ish looking thing that is the tiniest bar on the whole chart!

Here is something interesting many of you might want to do or at least paper-trade. Only take setups where the biggest VOLUME bar out of the last 5 is going in your direction, and better yet if it is the next to last or last bar. I like the next to last bar in these crazy times because I like to see confirmation of volume for at least 2 days. I will settle for one if I HAVE to. But if you look at the triggering bar on the Eur/nzd. Look at that awful volume. And then on increasing volume you get 2 doji like anemic,sorry looking bars, even though you arent in losses on that trade, this is a MOMENTUM system. Those kinds of bars following the kinds of bars we get in on usually spell bad news. mT4 and almost every Forex platform has a way to show volume in ticks. We just want simple bars, not lines or graphs.

If...you absolutely love the setup and arent getting any volume confirmation, go to the 4 hr chart and if your direction doesn't have the biggest bar by far in the last 5-10 bars, or the biggest few bars by a small margin, you are just flipping a coin. You may be going with the trend, but remember this always:

The short term trend that has low volume on each bar, is a treend made up of gamblers and manipulators. I dont want my money following them, because they always "leave the party fast without saying good bye". I want my money following volume. Volume isnt always right, but volume usually means commitment to the trend, at least for the next several bars. A gambler/manipulators commitment may be about as long as a $10 prostitute, and we are the ones who get stopped out[color="Red"].("And left with the bill for the party.")

I'm grateful to even be posting this because I foret too often that the one guy who was my trading coach for almost a year said that "Volume is the best indicator on earth."  Why?  "It always reveals the truth."

And to me guys, the big volume when it appears  is showing very small bars. That to ME, is telling is the big boys(together they make the one elephant) are pretty dis-interested in most pairs.  Look! Even the EUR/USD WHICH ALWAYS IS TRENDING SOMEWHERE AND USUALLY HAS THE MOST VOLUME IS JUST DRIFTING ALONG LIKE A OLD HOBO. ***Is all the money being used to prop up all these JPY pairs? Stupid questions for stupid times where we are left in the dark! LACK of volume always turns a trader into a "guesser."

Im going to post this on the other SEVEN board for the rest. I should share it. Ignoring volume has probably cost me many thousands$$$$$ of dollars. If it helps one person................

MY POSITION IS FLAT FOR THE 7 SYSTEM. AT THE MOMENT I AM WAITING FOR THE ELEPHANT TO GET HUNGRY AGAIN AND LEAVE US THE FOOTPRINTS OF WHERE HE IS HEADING. RIGHT NOW ITS JUST SQUIRRELS,DOGS AND CATS LEAVING THE TRAIL AND I DONT FOLLOW ANIMALS THAT THE ELEPHANT CAN CRUSH WITH ONE STEP.I DON'T ALWAYS WAIT FOR HIM, BECAUSE HE SLEEPS A LOT ,BUT IF I DID I WOULD BE A RICH MAN TODAY. NUFF SAID????

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Thank you charvo for your kind words. At least somebody is listening.  -)

What my journal has just shown me about volume in the 7 system:

Over 80% of my biggest winners, meaning most pips... came with one or more of these criteria:

1-The last 2 bars/candles before entering trade were increasing in ***volume....and if the last bar having more volume than any bar in the last 5 candles that is big bonus , and, the last bar must be larger than the one before it or at last bigger than normal.

2-The next to last bar before entry is the largest volume bar and size bar with the last bar also being higher higher than normal volume, but never low!

3-If you get just a high volume last bar and it is not bigger than normal size candle...something is wrong. Dont play. Treat it like a doji candle.

Thats it. Hard to believe 80% of my winners came with just one of these "rules" attached to it.

LET ME AND THE BOARD KNOW WHAT YOU OBSERVE THAT ADDS TO THIS OR REFUTES IT. HAPPY TRADING!

And of course................So nice to the "The seven" back again on this thread. Let us all wish him well, and the best of luck in his real estate vocation.

Hi Silat,

Volume is not something that I have looked into that much before, which volume indicator do you use?

I see 4 which I have included in the chart below that come standard in MT4.

I got destroyed by this mornings rediculous action. Any one else?

I clearly told everyone that even thpough its not in the system, France said it was bankrupt. Greece said it cannot pay back any money. 2 other EU countries had horrible news and the Euro kept going up. I then issued a warning in bold type to all of you:

EUROPE IS BROKE. LETS SEE HOW FAR THIS MOPVE UP WILL LAST! GET READY TO SHORT....

Yes or no?  Well...... the brain surgeon that I am, I short the EUR/USD AT 1.3500,THEN GET KNOCKED OUT BY  THE HAIR ON A ZEBRAS BEHIND 2 DAYS LATER. Small mistake on my part. I jump back in 100 pips lower and it was Christmas for 11 trading days down. I kept adding to my position and had 3x normal when a 400 pip bar of which over 100 pips was pure wick, taking out 3and 1/2 bars worth of stops by 9am reverses itself like "magic and plummets till 2pm, desroying both longs and shorts in one bar. I can assure all of you that the brokerage firms that hold the action for themselves were partying big this afternoon. They made money whether you were long,short, getting in, getting out, .The only survivers who profited were people who had a weekly high stop! Do you know anyone besides the institutions who would play like that.

This is why this game is soooooo hard. One anomoly like this and it can wipe out countless accounts or even with good money mgmt, can take away your whole months profit in 4 hrs.  To make matters worse of not only us "7" players but most every other trader, all the JPY pairs did the same thing. The JPY went and did the same. Have any of you seem a bar that big as on the AUD/JPY.  That bar belongs on a porn star, not a forex chart.

Guys, I am not happy (who is?) losing 4 weeks of profits on one 6 hr period, but Im very, very unhappy losing it on 1 6 hr period that is abmormal and that needs to be investigated.....and whats especially upsetting is all of us would have made a bundle in the end as the 7 SYSTEM had us on the right side. Who exactly was on the other side of the trades during those spikes when the jpy pairs gapped up like a 6 story building and came crashing down and who was oyt that made all those euro pairs spike like a cardiogram patient having a heart attack? Oh well.....lets see...we have no SEC. Who will look into this? ..................Nobody.

What are all those psychology books going to tell me? We all know. They will all say to take a break and come back when Im relaxed,right? Well, if I do that, when I come back the euro might be at .9500 against the USD!

So because I am more aggressive than many of you, I have re-entered some of the trades, (Im not missing out if this is a total collapse coming) but more conservatively. I must admit this reminds me of that flash crash of 3 yrs ago in the stock market where the Dow moved 1000 points in like what, 1 or 2 hours, or something like that? Well, you can bet the SEC investigated. Here....I think we are going to have more of these "Black Swan events" than ever before. I am just surprised it took so long for this to happen. But 2 events in one day? The Euro and the JPY pairs? Amazing.  And the fact that I risked less than 8% of my total acct, even with ultra aggressive adding to positions, is that supposed to make us who got trampled feel better,according to Mark Douglas and all the psychology books. I have 2 words for them all:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  -(

Oh and about volume. The volume that came out of nowhere for one day on this, do you think it was an accident, or a well tied collaboration? Almost like a Forex Mafia? Did all of you know that 10 banks control 70% of all the voluke in Forex. I find this astounding that all the euro pairs and all the jpy pairs were all moving up and down at exactly the same day if not the same hour for 2-3 months already! No one investigates or even puts up a headline to ask how is this possible? I have many, many more questions I can ask you guys to ask yourselfves but, suffice it to say I am still in the same mode for now:

EURO:BEARISH!

Lets all be patient,calm down..... come back in short on the next signal.(If there is one for another 3 weeks. lol  )

I think Im going to drink a lot of butt-weiser right now. How much do I need before I cant see anymore?

Pattern on the EUR/AUD?

You heard me complain enough about yesterdays rediculous action. However...nothing happens in a vacuum. Everything is part of a pattern. What can we learn about yesterdays action to take advantage of this huge whipsawing,not be eaten by it. I see something right now, that I sware, I have PM'ed Paul about it 2 or 3 times already. This is a new pattern forming as of recently. The 72 ema. Look at the daily and hourly chart of the eur/aud and see how that 72 is respected on both ends, both ways! Wow. Now what does that have to do with the 7 system? Nothing..............yet.

I am just sharing with you guys something I am finding very,very valid over many months of research and that is the 72, odd of a number as it is, is getting a lot of respect by the big boys.

Do all of you know that 70% of the volume comes from just 10 banks. I never wanted to believe it, but do you think its possible all 10 have the same main moving averages pinned to their wall, or maybe the avgs they "know" the others use?

Picture this on the Wall at Deutche Bank (#1 player in the world by the way.Anyone bother to buy their stock?)

Goldman- 200,55,12

Citibank- 155,72,20

Bogus Bank- 202, 34,8  (long,medium,short term avgs.)

and on and on for all the 10 maybe even top 40 players! And do you think theyse banks are using round number moving averages when they know thats what every retail player was taught in books?

So if anyone notices anything coming up we can use in THE 7 SYSTEM with the 72ema let me know. Also, lets think how we can take advantage or get out of the way or not even be there during those spikes.

Volume:  Oh yeah.....my friend volume. Most pairs showed no, and I mean zero increase in volume to show that this was coming. Thats why most of us are not able to use slowly increasing volume as we usually can to confirm continuation or change of trend. But it was all spelled out(for me anyway) on the eur/usd when volume on the daily spiked  to double its normal which wasnt very much 2 days before and then the next day no action. I knew that money was being "set up" somewhere. I just erroneously thought it was on the short side. I keep telling you newbies. You cant have large movement for long(if at all) without large volume! Yesterday was a twisted bad example, but if you look at every single daily volume bar for every pair, I bet they all were at the high of the year.

Big volume = big bars.=big profits.

Little volume =wasting your time=small bars or no change in price over many days.=........."wasted time."

A great martial arts teacher once said to me..."In martial arts as well as business you can afford to waste money on bad teachers(systems) but you cant afford time. Because money you can always get back. Years of wasted time studying with bad teachers(systems) can never be recovered."   LETS NOT WASTE ONE DAY WHERE WE DON'T LEARN SOMETHING NEW. AGREED?

--- 帖子 #996 ---
iTS NOW 1:30PM. Volume is higher now on the eur/usd that it was all day yesterday. Yet all we have is a doji at the moment. Wow.....this thing could explode at any moment! Cant wait for tomorrow.

IM ALREADY LONG THE AUD/USD:

I admit it, i snuck in early. I treated the last bar as if the wick was a body and closed above the band. I think in that case its so obvious.

Remember guys, we have one goal in this system if you come down to it:  THE GOAL IS SIMPLY TO GET OUR CANDLE TO THE TOP BAND AND HAVE IT STAY THERE  JUST A FEW DAYS. YOU CANT MAKE MONEY ON BOTTOM BANDS. LOL (reverse for shorts of course)

disclaimer: this is not part of the seven system, It is a modification. I am also experimenting with getting in on the second bar after a band cross if the 1st bar is not  big and convincing or volume is not increasing. Try it and report back to the thread. This might be a very interesting modification to the system.

What ONE variable improves this system?

Guys, I notice many of the pairs are trending very nicely, and we keep getting stopped out or...worse we cant get in on a move thats lasting a month at a time! Pro Forex traders wait all year for these conditions and this system is not as consistant as it was previously...IMHO. So.......

Have any of you tried any of my suggestions to modify the system for the better. You can only modify one thing at a time imho or youll never know for sure what is working or not. I suggested the following and no one has given me feedback on it. Well, I can say that I am doing better than before because I saw quickly the system wasnt putting strings of winners together as it was in the beginning. So I asked myself:

1-Is the weekly chart going in the same direction as the trade I want to take? That means the weekly bands must be going your way. One bar does not a trend make. But if the previous weekly bar is your color, thats a big bonus.

This system is giving way too many signals that are just blips on the screen and are totally against the trend. This must be corrected!

2-Have we found a moving average to get out at instead of using a move under or over the previous days high? Often the spikes,wicks and tails get you out and then resume the trend. This has to be accounted for and "countered." This means we must do back testing and curve fitting to find things that keep us in a trend , I am seeing that 1 bar H/L  is not good enough. Did I not mention that already? Yes I did.  -) For me if I found a great moving average to get out on insted of H/L of previous bar. You guys have to back test and find your own that YOU  are comfortable. I found it by wrecking my demo acct so I didnt have to hurt my real acct. So now...

I can breathe a lot easier without worrying that one weird day or one day of market manipulation is going to stop me from enjoying a very long ride. On the other hand you cant add anyting that will keep you in a loser too long.

GUYS, LETS HEAR FROM EVERYONE WHAT IS THE ONE PARAMETER THEY FOUND THAT KEEPS THEM FROM GETTING BOUNCED OUT AND IS KEEPING YOU IN THE GREEN.

Disclaimer: Until you do that please follow this awesome system as it was given. To make changes without back testing or curve fitting means you aren't using this system anymore. Its just another indicator.

LETS MAKE THIS THE PERFECT SYSTEM TO MAKE A LIVING AT FOREX WITH. WE CANT DO THAT IF WE ARE ALL BOUNCING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE AND NOT CONTRIBUTING IDEAS.

I AM HERE ONLY TO MAKE A LIVING AT FOREX. ANYTHING LESS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME.

Vovan,

Your system is not very clear. Why did you exit when you did, and when you give all the arrows, you dont give exits with them. And why did you exit when you did? What is  the "input" bar?

Can you clarify this for us? I hope you truly are making money with this system and are not going to give us a chat room or website to go to.  But....your system looks similar enougfh to ours. Id like to hear the complete rules, step by step, or number by number if you dont mind. Take care.

Greetings all  -  new member here

I have been following this system for several weeks and trading it, with mixed results, in a practice account.  I am fairly pleased with my results thus far.  However, in looking over my daily charts it occurs to me that in order to get into a long-term trend and stay there, one must wait for the trend to develop and then ride it.  I am going to try testing this for a month or so, and my plan is to enter trades when a daily bar hits the 7 ema opposite the trend direction.  So, in an uptrend enter the trade when the daily bar hits the LOWER ema and vice versa.  In addition, I would move down to the 4-hour chart to look for my entry point.

Clearly you will not catch the bottom or top of a trend at its' reversal point, and the number of active trades my be reduced, but I think this may help to stay in a trade once it is entered.

Looking forward to observations and input from other members.

DOES ANYONE ELSE NOTICE ALL THE CANDLESTICK RULES GOING OUT THE WINDOW FOR MANY WEEKS ALREADY!!!?

I wont bore you will the 20 things I see that are not right, but, do any of you see, big green engulphing bars, which are supposed to be bullish, now more than 50% of the time they are eaten away by many smaller red bars like termites eat away a house? No fiollowthru on the long side.

2-There is no longer follow thru when bars break out of a base as it often reverses right back after 1 or 2 bars, be it in the daily or 60m.

3-Wicks on top of a green bar which many times are bearish are now flooowed by 5 or 6 bars all the exact same with wicks on top of every one!!!. (Its as if a different bank or syndicate is coming in to take some quick money shorting the pair, even knowing that it is going to continue to climb.

4-I am noticing that dojis unless they come after a huge high volume, that run instead of meaning indecision/reversal....now mean "Im just taking a rest  guys. Add more here!"

5-Does anyone notice how beautifully these Japanese longs have played their cards. All the longs that missed the party even 2 weeks ago were afraid to get in as it always looked exhausted, and the shorts who say a couple of wicks and or doji bars, jumped in short and got their head handed to them? Yep, the Institutions IMHO have done a beautiful job of PREVENTING those 3 bar pullbacks that allow others to join the trend, and have done so much to make the trend seem to get weaker and weaker..........but it never did!

As an aside, on the weekly EUR/USD there are 2 tiny bars outside the bottom of the band which often means sideways movement for days or weeks until the bands catch up to price or price runs away from the bands....again.  This market is really, really boring despite the trends so many of the pairs oare in. Anyone agree? I even have a 60 min bar system that is so boring I cant even trade it anymore because they never bounce off of the moving averages that signal my entrance.  I see so many false signals in our 7 system as well. Tell you this much. I know who is making money now in this system.

Those guys who dont take ANY signal UNLESS ITS IN THE DIRECTION OF BOTH BANDS!  Anyone else makingmoney now, with this or any other system, please let me know. Id loooove to hear your details. -)  I am one lucky SOB  to have discovered that following the bands for right now isa the way to go. For now.

EVERYONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THAT MY FAVORITE PAIR SHORT HAS BEEN THE gbp/aud short.  I will be in until the top band takes me out, NOT THE PREVIOUS CANDLE HIGH! Sh^t changes guys and you gotta roll with it.  Yet in my paper acct in my explorer,Ive been doing lousy following this exactly top the rules. YES....I changed my mind.....for now.

ThIS seems like a good time to take a vacation for newbies.

I almost always do that whenever I lose 3 or 4 trades in a row. I however am doing well following the bands and my GBP/AUD short made up for many losers. What a run its on, huhhh?  Dont blame me guys. I gave it to you all on Feb.12th and told all of you to get back in if you get taken out. Did any of you go along with me on the ride?

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Is anyone keeping a journal:

And each day moving all the open trades over to another page and offering commentary on every single trade? And the ones you get knocked out of ,writing TWICE as much commentary, as to why and how you could have avoided the loss or made it smaller?

If you dont keeping tabs the normal way of journaling you can assign each stop out a number to tell you why and how you got stopped. I know a guy who makes a living doing thios that assigns each trade going in a number 1-5 and on getting stopped or taking a profit he assigns them 6-10. This guy was making over 77% annually last i spoke with him. I wish I could bring him over to this thread and have him give us some tips. amazing trader. Learned everything he knows from this website, he claims! LOVE IT!!!!

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Interesting points as always silat.

"Those guys who dont take ANY signal UNLESS ITS IN THE DIRECTION OF BOTH BANDS!"

Do you mean only selling if both the bands are pointing down? Seems to be hardly any signals in that case.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
thats just my preference. But at least one band going down and one flat or rounding. and i get plenty of signals if I look at the top 20 pairs each day.

Thats another thing, I am no longer taking 8 million different trades because the signal is there. No human on earth can discover his mistakes and improve his system with 9 trades going at once. you want more money, just pick 3 pair and play 3x the lots.  Hint: when i wake up in the morning and I do not know which currency in general Id like to see move up or down, i know im way overbought! And over bought traders dont keep proper records.***  Anyone relate to this?  -)

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Vovan, our system  says we get out as soon as the candle to the left of the recent one  has its high or low pierced, depending if short or long. Go back to the beginning of the thread and then scroll down a few posts. Be patient with yourself. I know people that give 2 candles h/l to be breached.

NO DISRESPECT TO THE 7 WHO GAVE US THIS WONDERFUL SYSTEM, but this is not a money machine. If it waqs, he'd quit his job and be here all day. It is just a good way to trade.................and in my opinion, only until you midify this and make it your own. Now I see so clearly why so few ever make a living following another persons system. It should work for one as it does for two, yes? But it doesnt. You have to do the work. The 7, our moderator did the work....maybe what he sees with his own eyes make this a 200% annual return winning system. Thats why its perfect for him, but maybe only good for most of us. I cant say for sure. Take 10 people following this system  to the exact letter and 10 people will be in different trades by mid week. How is that happening?  LOL

I JUST PERSONALLY AM MODIFYING THIS A BIT BY GETTING OUT ON THE BREAK OF THE BAND. YOUR EXAMPLE IS "IFFY" FOR ME. But remember its not what the people here on this thread oare doing. Only me. I dont have enough time to answer you as you are asking me whether to wait for bar close to get out. id say off hand in this short post i wouldnt let it get much pat the band. Please PM  me with further questions as we may be confusing the others.

FOR ALL- I am finding this system does not work as well if you take all the signals in this particular climate we have been in this 2013. Last year the last qtr of 2012 it seemed 80% of the signals were golden. Thats why you dont throw something away, you modify it or....wait for things to go back to normal..whatever that is. -) then if you find one or 2 additional rules to modify it. That could be a lifetime of work!!! I choose to use the bands as ONE line, one indicator. That doesnt mean it will work. ask me in 30 days when I have done more testing.

hi all

just join this the 7 trading system and its so simple that i found possible long entry on EUR/AUD waiting for today's close..

senior members advice needed..

regards

jeet

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
hi all, update on previous post no trade b,cuz according The7 rule if the  signal candle has wick towards the trade avoid it . going into sniper mode waiting for another signal..

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Where is there a rule that says you cant trade in direction of the wick. In most 2013 trading action I find 75% of trades are set up that way. As far as your eur/aud trade, it gapped down the next day and the founder of the system left us no rules for that. Me? Id get in short right away and use the same "high of previous bar "  as your stop if you can stand the 180 pip heart. I did it and Im soooooooo happy right now.

As an aside....I think the Euro is in for heavy downside pressure as 85% of my trades are all euro shorts. I think we have some interesting times coming....cypress threatening to leave the euro, AUD  prime minister being asked to step down and their dollar goes up!!!!! And the jpy pairs are looking like they want to actually run on each pairs merit so there may not even be a correction......JUST A RESUMPTION!

****BEWARE.......Something is going on ,that Bernanke said he'd like to step down early. Save your bullets guys. I say the next 30 days will be all news driven action. Sometimes technical players HAVE  to listen to the news. Ive been short rthe euro since God was a baby and its making up for all my other losers. Prediction: minimum-more downside pressure on the EURO for AT LEAST 3 more weeks, maybe 3 months or more. Also, if the stock market corrects you know that the euro plummets as the american stock market and the euro move inversely. Thats another bullet in the chamber for the Euro. This may be one of the greatest shorting opportunities in  a long long time. Be ready. When stopped out on any euro trades, track them and be ready for at least one re-entry, especially if both bands face down!

For the newbies: I no longer take short trades if both bands face up. And reverse for longs! Its like standing in front of a roaring train. Most of your losers will come from that scenario.

For the experienced guys: If I can take only trades where both bands face down, I will usually get in with an extra lot or look to add a lot after 1 day of winning action. Those are the bread and butter of this system. Anyone who loses money only tasking trades with both bands down, even if you get 2 trades per week, email me please!!!!!!! PM  me. I need to hear about it. It seems almost impossible according to my stats and logic. I mean look at the money we all lost not being long all jpy pairs when both bands were up!!!!!!

GBP/USD to me is still playable long because after the long entry we had nothing but sideways volume. So its either going to break out or break down, but the bears still have some fight in them. I want to see 2 engulfing green bars any day now.Just put your stop under todays low and you are set!!!!

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
I have been using this system since my days as a newbie. Due to too much uncertainty in the euro zone, i have tweaked my "7 Trading system" and

added two new elements.

1) A 21 EMA- going short when the market is below the 21 EMA and bouncing off the 5 high

and long when the market is above the 21 EMA and bouncing off the 5EMA low.

2) A default setting MACD to indicate whether the market is bullish or bearish.

These two have helped survive alot of noise that is apparent.

Few things here:

1. Gratz on trying to establish some trading mechanics.

2. Remove MACD - you have MAs already, MACD is basically the same. Too many indicators blur your vision, therefore distracts decision making process.

3. Tighten stop loss.

4. Change your mindset: as you have an ill principle of a so called traders logic - if A follows B, then do C. Just do C.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Firstly, thanks for your comment.

I have very well working stop loss setting rules in my system.

Well the MACD- remains there tight..

I am quite experienced and know that my system doesn't work all the time.

Good advice signoir  BUT  This is what make me profit so I am afraid that I will not take your advice.

You are most welcome Danny to stick to your trading style and take any advice or not. Good luck in your trading.

POLL-TO SEE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF USERS OF THE 7 SYSTEM ARE NET PROFITABLE:

Guys, Its been a long time since the founder of our system has rejoined us and we all have many questions. As I have told you all before, I am profitable with this and have even posted my live trade balance in my acct somewhere on here by number of pips when I had 12 or 13 plays going on, and all of them big winners. You want the truth? Those days are gone! I am still way ahead by pips with this system but I cannot make a living doing just this system as it had looked when this thread was first started. We need information. I have tried to share with as many people via PM what I am using to filter my trades. We all should have just one or 2 major criteria that if they are passed, the trade is taken. Period. I dont like oscillators and fibs for the reason that there is always an argument  to both take the trade and not take it. I want " NO ARGUMENT"  indicators or set-ups.  So, lets find olut who is showing net profit regardless of whether they take the system with no additional rules(but maybe a couple of filters) or they use the bands as just part of a bigger system. lets find out what % of us are net profitable by now and for how long. And also if it is paper/sim or real money acct.  This should be very interesting. I also think to keep it short and simple we should list what our 2 or 3 most important rules are to take the trade. I will demonstrate by example.

I also,without being rude or picking on anyone want to bring out another observation I've made and kept quiet about for months. THE PEOPLE WHO COME HERE DO NOT USE OTHERS TO BETTER THEIR SYSTEM, THEY JUST COME HERE AND TELL US WHAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE DOING. OR IF THEY DO ASK, THEY DONT BOTHER TO REPORT BACK ON WHETHER THEIR BACK TESTING OF SOMEONE ELSES RULES WORK FOR THEM. IN OTHER WORDS WE ARENT MAKING THE MOST USE OF EACH OTHER AND THAT IS THE MAIN REASON WE HAVENT ALL TURNED PROFITABLE BY NOW, IMHO.

OK, here we go. Remember, its the losers we learn the most from. Tell the truth in trading. Always. One B.S. artist whose system or thoughts get into your head or your trading strategy can set you back for years! How about all the guys here on FF that sware to us they are making this and that and now they want to share their system publicly for nothing. Maybe some are telling the truth, but cant we assume that 75% are not.(and only 75%...  that's being very generous) Or a guy who writes a book on candle patterns and tells you this pattern has been backtested over centuries since the early rice traders of Japan. How could it not be profitable? Or the guy who tells you that if you jump out every time price hits the 1.618 area...you mean the banks dont know many of us are waitng to get out at that area....and how about the majority of us who bailed and took small profits long before we hit 100.00% of the prior movement, let alone 161%!!!! B.S. KILLS 80% ODF TRADERS IN MY OPINION.IM DOING IT 15 YEARS. I KNOW. I MYSELF HAVE BEEN BULLSHITTED MORE TIMES THAN I HAVE BREATHED AIR! I wasted yrs trying fib systems and other peoples software systems that never could break even,let alone give anyone useful information. Plus, bullshit spreads like a virus, and once its spread for so many years,it becomes accepted as fact. Do any of you have any religions or spiritual practices that come to mind? lol  SO LETS BE HONEST HERE ON THIS THREAD.

And those who read every post Ive put up here as well as my selections on the other 7 board, know Im not losing money.What is interesting is that the selections I have publicly given out, if you were to manage the exits a different way, you'd find most of my trades are digging out deeper and deeper profits every week sometimes for 2-3 months,long after we exited on this systems rules.[b](This is something some of you might want to back test and share your results with me privately.)I also am going to be starting a martial arts club for those who live in Florida where I am, as traders who do martial arts synchronize both parts of their brain and so both activity's results get significantly better!!!

POLL: ARE YOU A WINNER OR LOSER IN THIS SYSTEM? :      How long? Real or Sim acct? About how many pips?  What do you see as the largest "hole" (making bad trades) in your strategy? Best change(if any) youve made?

POLL:

#1-SILAT 50-WINNER-SINCE MY FIRST POST ON THIS BOARD. Real acct.(Im a loser in my sim acct as I've combined too many different systems there. Bad move.) Biggest hole in my play is not keeping records and comments in a log on every trade I take. (90% of professional traders do not make this mistake I was told.) Best change Ive made is I never get into a trade where price on a 60 minute chart has moved away from the 8-SMA.I prefer price and the 8sma to be touching each other.  B- I allow myself the judgement call to not get out until the upper band is broken on a "closed" candle instead of the previous days high for longs,opposite for shorts. Look at the way the bands flow.It allows you soooo much more room to let trades develop, and also run its full course. I USE THE BAND LINE MUCH MORE THAN I USE THE PDH/PDL as an exit. This has been gold for me.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

PART 2

*****Look for explanation to this in my next post.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
*****   But... since I don't play full lots,the money I've won, divided by the 6 months or so,that I'm using this system makes me a net loser when you count my living expenses into it! Most traders never ever talk that part. So based on that, probably 99% of traders lose by the end of the year if they quit their job and just trade! The 2-5% that supposedly win in this business are ahead in their brokerage acct, yet their savings acct. gets lower every year until they are broke. We all know 90% of winning traders have to go flat broke before they will ever stop trading and go back to work when they have a winning system in their hands. This is something all of you should ponder many,many times thruout your trading career!!!! So guys and gals, those of you who have PM'ed or emailed me with praise, I am flattered. But Im just another loser the way I see it.  If I cant build up my real account...my bank account! And statistics say most traders who ever become fortunate enough to win every year without fail cannot get out of that category. Think of the great hedge fund trader by the name of "Victor Neiderhoffer." READ HIS BIOGRAPHY. I bet it will make 1/4 of you give up trading right on the spot!

So lets say for example purposes that I have won about 1800 pips since I am on this thread, which is about 6 months. I do not play full lots as I do not have sufficient capital in my acct. I do not believe in risking more than 3% of your capital per trade. LET ME BREAK THIS DOWN FOR YOU FOLKS!  YOU ARE GOING TO FREAK OUT!

Lets say on a micro acct at 10 cents per pip, if you started with $1000-to make sure you never went broke, that you never had to dip into your savings again,  is there one person here that could really say..."Oh thats way too much money to insure never going broke. Take some back." NO TRADER ON EARTH WOULD EVER SAY THAT,RIGHT? In fact looking at it that way, with that goal,  $1000 is kinda low, right? Right!  So...we all know,not a trader on earth can pay all his bills and support a family on a micro acct. Its not possible. So a micro is only good for building up your bankroll and/or your experience...nothing else! Agreed? Agree.

So now this means if you want to open a mini acct which is $1 a pip, you need $10,000 to start if you use the same criteria and goals! But, even if you make  one dollar per pip, you still cant pay all of your bills. Not unless you have no rent, live with your mother, she pays for all of your food, etc. You getting it now? That means if you "only" make 500 pips per month,thats $500 a month to live on, youll never ever, ever be able to pull money out of your trading account and blow it on fun things...you know....the real reason we area  trading, so we can live a nicer lifestyle!!! Otherwise, why trade for money? Just have a sim acct the rest of your life and do it as a hobby. You'll never risk one dollar the rest of your life. Wait...it gets worse.

So, we now come to the inevitable FACT......if you want to trade for a living in the spot Forex market. your going to have to open a regular account. The way it used to be. The nice thing is you now earn $10 per pip(avg.) on every winner. But using the same goals and wanting the same safety as before, you now need $100,000 to trade safely and still if you have  1 or 2 losing weeks you could lose enough to always have permanant doubt! It isnt hard to lose 500 pips in  a full week of trading and thats $5000.Do it twice in a row and thats $10,000.Losing that much in 2 weeks would shake any normal persons resolve. Thats 10% of your bankroll.

So if you put yourself at the 1500 pip win level of trading I used for the example, you have just won 15,000 dollars for 6 months of work. Thats 30,000 a year! Better we spend our time doing something else if thats the best we can get. And dont forget, I am assuming you never have a losing month to make that many pips in 6 months. Imagine in real life, real trading if you have  a losing month, you will freak out because now you have to make double the pips next month and even thats not enoug to put you back on track as your expenses came out of your bank account to pay last months living expenses and you do want to pay back that "loan", right? Definitely!  The first time you dip into your savings and dont put it back as a trader, is the beginning of the ensd of your career and maybe your marriage and present lifestyle as well. All of this was given to me by a professional stock market trader who lived by what I am saying: NEVER TOUCH YOUR SAVINGS TO TRADE OR YOU ARE DEAD.

So lets see, if I made 1500 pips in 6 months on this system, that's 300 pips per month( and I'd wager that would beat the results of 98% of the folks here at FF, and even 90% of people who "claim" to be winners.),  how would I be able to consistently  make double, triple, quadruple that and more, to live the way I really want to, to make all the struggle worth it?

So, the $64,000 question now appears. It is the only question of any importance at all in a traders life at this point,once you made it up to a regular acct trading for $10 a pip. And that is:

How can I make enough pips every single month?!!!

(you cannot have more than 1 losing month per year or you will crumble under the mental strain of making it up and with 2 or more losing months it would be almost impossible to "hit" your monthly goals every month that year,so it would screw up your trading results for many,many months into the future.(Not fun to think about, I know.)

Here is the good part of all this seemingly depressing news: If you can survive with on less than 800 pips per month($96k per year) just spend 3-4 yrs(at most) becoming a male nurse, get a job in a big city or at least a bustling good size town and with 10 hrs of overtime per week you'd be at about $70,000 per year in earnings. This is what a lady friend of mine who is only in the USA 5 yrs makes every year in LA  as a nurse. Almost any job in a hospital that administers tests like MRI's, X-RAY tECHS, and whatever you need 2 yrs min. of college for will pay about the same with overtime. So go help people in need, cut out the stress, and have the best medical benefits in the country and a steady paycheck.

Not for you. Become a police detective with a 2-4 yr degree in most criminology type fields and again, with overtime youll be making like 70k per year with the best benefits in America. No stress. I would choose this route myself if I was 10 or 15 yrs younger if I gave up trading.

So, why am I taking all this time to write this?

1-If I can give one "over-enthusiastic" young person who doesnt realize how many yrs of their life they can waste if they trade and then discover after yrs of study and screen time,that they are stuck on the fence.....they are winners, but not big enough winners to ever quit their job. You know how you will be hurting to be stuck on the fence all of your life? LOL

Seriously ,it is very sad.

2-I am at that point myself. I must go to the next level very shortly(I am giving myself a year) or I must just do this as a hobby and ......Oh Jeez!!!......"sigh"...........................I might actually have to go and get a real job again. See how much fun THAT  is after 5 yrs of staying home  and trading!

It is what ex-cons must feel like after being released from prison after doing a looooong stretch. You feel like you aren't part of the regular world anymore. (I hope one day OUR govt. can remedy that, or this country is going to get out of control.)  I had the sad experience of watching a friends son go thru that this week as he turned 30, had dropped out of college to trade at 25 and now is moving back in with his parents. Hes sick about it, and my buddy is ready to cry, for both reasons. So understand that the decisions you make about trading might very well affect many people around you. Especially those you love most. And besides.....if you DO make iot as a trader and you impress your wife and all the family members who doubted you, how long do you think the cheering will last? 2 or 3 months? And then it becomes...."(Yawn), Yeah, yeah, I told you 4 times already my son/husband/boyfriend trades for a living. No, I dont think its all that much fun. And if you want to know how he does it, go ask him...Im tired of everyone thinking I know. To me its like watching paint dry!!! "

3-I am being considered for a writing position for a trading magazine on the Internet and I am using this piece to let them know my stance about people choosing trading as a vocation.They requested it.

Do I think I can find a way to step it up 2 notches and make it all worthwhile and make the $$$ I need? Yes..........I do! And if I cant do it in another year I will either hang it up, or hire a professional coder for one final shot. Money we can always make somehow. It's time we all run out of.

Just keep in mind, we read about all the glamorous stories in books like Market Wizards, but what we often fail to realize is these guys are called "Wizaeds" for a reason. Not only are they all gifted with genius, but they were very, very lucky. By luck I mean, lucky enough to be born at exactly the right time when their particular style of trading was in sync with the markets. In other words, the greatest trader in the world will go broke if he made one wrong mistake....such as not putting a stop on his longs when the flash crash occurred.Trading is a very unforgiving profession. Do 99% right and 1% wrong and it just might eat you alive as if you were just another sucker on the train to Margaritaville. I also know a day trader of stocks that has won every month for over a year, and to me he has no aptitude for this field. Time will get him,eventually. That's another thing, as written in the book "RANDOM WALK ON WALL STREET"   I agree it is very true. A losing trader can actually win for a long, long time before his system falls apart if he jumped in at the right time. Example: Almost every trader of equities on the long side only for the last 3 yrs!

Choose carefully the path you really want. Me? I really want to trade professionally.Bad!!!

"A man has got to know his limitations"- Clint Eastwood- standing over a dead mans body after a duel.

I personally believe trading will kill you if you invest years into it and it doesnt pay off. Then it can just degenerate into nothing more than a compulsion, a bad habit, a need to be right, a need for action, and you take down every one on the ship with you. As the most interesting man in the world says on the Dos Equis commercial  "Choose Carefully my friends."

Hmmmm, no one has the patience to read my threads, take my poll to let me know who is profitabel or not and why. I wish O had a guy like muself helping us nail down the holes in our system as Im trying to help you guys do. I think I am just going to answer those who PM me. Most of you it seems cant devote an hour a day to this. I devote my entire waking life to it.

I'm just going into listen and learn mode here. I guess you guys all have 2 jobs and a wife and kids, so sure its hard to find the time to be here every day. I understand. Lets keep this thread alive,folks. Im not going to be showing my live trading results to people here on the board anymore. I have been shocked into learning a very very good lesson......even if you prove you win every month...people dont have the time to follow you and go along for the ride. Well, I will always be close by. I'd like to see someone else posting OVER 50% WINNING TRADES IN THIS BOARD...as I did, easily...and then I can follow him or maybe do a JOINT VENTURE. rEAD MY OTHER POSTS ON OTHER BOARDS IF YOU WANT THE LOW DOWN ON HOW HARD THIS BUSINESS IS TO EVER MAKE A LIVING AT IT. Even I,,,,,who was lucky enough to be ahead from week one of following this and never looked back,never had a losing month, and finding this system is easy to generate pips every week......but NOT  enough to quit your my day job, And boys...I need to quit my day job!!!!!!!!! THATS THE ONLY REASON i AM HERE.

Silat 50,

The reason , for me anyway, I stopped following is because your style became very discretionary so that one had to have your mind to trade it correctly and see things the way you saw them.

If we could prove following the basic 7 rules without discretion or subjectivity is profitable or not, then we can move on to looking at other things. So far I have not seen that proven , one way or the other yet.  That's the inherent challenge with all systems...the one person who knows what to look for and when and why is the one who profits.  Your comments have been helpful though and welcomed!

Why don't you consider setting up a trade copier for us.  It's not hard to do, and that way we can all be the same trades at the same time.

Wow..Wee  Silat50

What a lesson you teach here....

Yes What you say is the truth....The whole truth and Nothing but the truth....

BUT....We all live in hope.........

....The Holy Grail......

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Pprsper, I am the first to admit that the way "I" now trade it, the style did become discretionary. And I certainly understand how people would want exact rules. But I am also the first to admit that I am not willing to bet my entire trading acct on just these rules. The results in the beginning warranted it...the results now, while still good, do not. -)

Dont get me wrong, I loooove this system, I just find that following the route of the bands rather than the previous bars h/l has become for me more profitable. And some weeks it is not. Im not the best trader here by any means. I just know when something feels "off" to me. And this system stopped being as dependable as it once was. Although I pity the guys who trade against it. (smile)

What maybe you could propose to the board, is every one of us make up our own 7 system. It has to be "almost identical to this but with  a couple or 3 small changes. And then we can follow that with a trade explorer in a paper acct and see how we all do........AND STILL FOLLOW THIS TOO.

i TRULY THINK THE MARKET MAKERS WERE TOYING WITH US FOR A WHILE AND LET US WIN. THEY KNOW DAMN WELL MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE SWING TRADERS PLACE THEIR STOP ABOVE OR BELOW THE PRIOR DAYS H/L, DONT YOU THINK?

Do you have any other ideas? Id love to hear them. That said, they cant always hit our stops and when the market wasnt volatile there wasnt enough ATR per day to knock out our stops with ease. Now there are.

Want to know a secret: I smelled this coming when we had that one day where wicks were taking out 3,4 and 5 days wirth of stops on one wick and then continue down in its usual direction. Thats when I said...........".they have our number." But Im sure its not us little guys but many what I call...."baby elephants" that are getting crushed beneath the hedge funds feet as well.

I admit too, that if I just take a trade according to the original rules and both the daily bands and the weekly charts arent both going our way,we lose too often to suit my taste. So for me...I must refine it!  -)

As well we all are on different schedules so my hope of having a trading or chat room is not feasable now. All said and done...we CAN  make this system work!!!

The future for me guys to be honest is to trade both Forex "and stocks with this system. Because stocks each have completely different market makers, usually different players and thus behave with different personalities. The real money is in stocks, from what I have seem this past year. You can have a slow moving Forex market, but for $25 a month, you can get a scanner that will bring up every stock trading over 1m shares per day thats in motion....now! I want to be in both markets at the same time...soon.

I apologize if I came off a bit irritated, but I have no second job, this is my life. If this doesnt work for me......Im dead. Im totally committed to making this work.

Davros, I dont want the holy grail. I do want what I have seen my mentors and instructors before me achieve. To never have a losing month. Losing weeks? Yes. But a full time trader who has kids to feed and wives to make happy cant afford a losing month. Besides, any trader when he has his first losing month after a year if winning...his confidence is forever cracked! Mine was,anyway.  And the daytraders who grab their nickels and dimes hope to avoid it...but they get chopped up faster than anyone....using 5 min charts in Forex.    They are like this all day long, till they drop dead of heart disease or nerves.

In the spirit of sharing ideas and techniques, I have been using this system for about two months with mixed success...some trades profitiable, others not.  Overall my account is up about 10% in two months.  That's fine for me, taking things slow and easy.  I also scalp several mornings a week.  This is better, and candidly, more successful.

However...One thing I have learned from scalping, is hedging.  Can't do it in a US account on the same pair, but you can use correlating pairs as a hedge.  for example, hedge eur/usd with usd/chf.  Their patterns are nealy perfect mirror images of each other.  So if you are in a trade and it looks like it is going badly, you can either dump the trade for a loss, or hedge it, and as the hedge becomes profitable, use the proceeds to eliminate pieces of the bad trade.  Over time, you can completely wipe out the bad trade.  This takes patience and at times it may seem like you are always on the wrong side of the trade, but it does work.  Also, you may need to spend a little more time in front of the computer, and check every hour or four hours, to make it work.  It's worth practicing in a dummy account.

Hope this helps someone.

Glip, in 15 yrs of trading, every hedging system always wouldnd up making the brokerage firm more money than the trader. It always in the end takes away  bottom line profit at the end of the month. You know know many offers I get every week to buy options hedging systems where I can make 10% a month with no risk, and they show the stats to prove it. If it could be done Warren Bufffet and Goldman Sachs would lock it up by now! I say its a fantasy.

The SOES BANDITS of the 70's and 80's were the last free lunch....IMHO.

how is everyone doing with this system playing it just the way it was invented. I never said not to do it, i just said it hasnt been that great these last 3 months. I suspect it may get hot again. All we need are 3 day up, days down kind of patterns to get rich with this. Im sorry I complicated it for so many of you

ENTER GBP/USD@15401-15411

I have just closed out 2 very good trades to get ready for a massive move on this gbp/usd. Heres how Im playing it. IM CONFIDENT ENOUGH,I dont need the whole bar which is up huge, like 130 pips and its only 6:45am!!! I am placing my stops at 1:5394 for one third of my trade and at 15328 for the 2nd 2/3. If I put my stop under the whole bar I could only afford 1 lot. I think if we retrace more than 1/2 of this bar, its a bogus move,anyway or I can re-enter later  I will bet anyone here money that if you only took trades with big engulphing bars like this and used 60% of the bar as your stop or even, you can allow for a ..618 retrace and put your stop 6 or 7 pips under that if you like Fib numbers, you will find this system will make you very happy at the  end of a year. Problem is we must be very patient to wait for these type bars. I suspect we have a 400pip rally before taking a breather. Wish me luck!

looks like a very strong strategy, I'll test it and post results.

GBP/USD -MOVING 2/3 OF MY POSITION STOPS TO 15462. The OTHER 1/3 to break even.

THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE 7 SYSTEM WOULD DO IT, BUT I HAVE AFFIRMAING ACTION COMING FROM ELSEWHERE THAT MAKES ME WANT TO DO SO.

MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS THAT THIS SYSTEMS STOPS SHOULD BE MODIFIED WHEN PRICE IS OUTSIDE THE BANDS. MORE ON THAT NEXT POST.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
THINKING OF STARTING A TIP OF THE DAY THREAD:  PM me if interested. I was thinking of opening another thread, maybe on a different site, that would give a 'tip of the day" in how to play this system the way I think is more profitable. I am not a champion trader by any means but I seem to be the only one who consistently wins with it every month. Im not talking 1 or 200 pips either. You all have seen many of my predictions posted. Have I even had 2 losers yet on the board? I lost track.

Anyway one hint I'd like to give all of you is that we cant play the usual way of putting the stop under the last bars high or low when price is outside the bars. Why? Because I bet money this is where 2/3 of you get stopped out, and the other 1/3 of you have already taken profit by now.(way,way to early)  So I am saying that when price action is outside of both bands it shows we are either in a parabolic move or momentum is really strong and we need to allow more room for those tails and wicks, especially since I told you that all the smart money knows 1/2 of us put our stops somewhere under the previous days low for medium term traders and under the 60 min low for day traders. This is why most of us lose. Our stop gets hot and the next week we see we would have made 100-200 or more pips if we allowed more room. This obviously is also needed because the bars often get very small for several bars in a row as in the GBP/USD  IS RIGHT NOW!!!!!   But if we are outside the bar and the last bar is an engulphing or a decent size bar of 80 or more pips, yes, you can leave it alone. But..............what would be wrong is putting your stop under the open of the 3rd bar back or even at its 50% point. Im sure we all agree until that is broken this trend is not in question.

We always want tpo get out WHEN the trend is in question, not when  a tiny 30 pip bar gets clipped and we are relieved to get out with our profits.  -)

This is just one example. You can usually put your stop at least 80 pips lower or as I told yu I often do now...PUT YOUR STOP UNDER THE BOTTOM BAND. AND EVEN GIVE 10-15 PIPS MORE ROOM TO ALLOW FOR TAILS AND SPIKES.(If lower band isnt that far away.)

Also, I am going to think about starting  a private forum here or somewhere or maybe even a trade room if there is enough interest where you guys give me YOUR selections. . Here is how it would work: I would let YOU guys give me 1 trade each from the 7 system each week. Its ok if it is already in play by a couple of bars.I often prefer that. The only rule would be, that you had to give me a play that was below/above a certain moving average on both the daily and the hrly charts. I am using this with great success, and no, don't even ask me what the moving avg is unless I open the room or a very serious new thread opens. Lets just say I got rid of moving averages for years from my trading and this one I backtested has such continuation when broken thru, it made me add just this one to my trade rules!!!

WANTING TO START A NEW THREAD WE CAN EVENTUALLY SELL,TURN INTO A FUND,BECOME A PAID FOR TRADING ROOM OR GROW BEYOND FOREX FACTORY BASED ON THE SEVEN SYSTEM:

So picture this: Lets say we have 5 guys. Each of you give me 1 play a week from the 7 system we already use.. Out of the 5 or 6 plays, I would pick only ONE  or TWO for us to get into. If we get stopped out, I may tell you guys to re-enter.(Many of you lose because you dont re-enter, you just go on to the next trade,right?) We always have to try to have money in action. Thats bullshit that the best traders make money sitting on their hands. After a while its called inertia, or the "deer in the headlights" syndrome, and many of us traders come down with this disease after going 7 or 8 losers or even losing weeks in a row, yes?  =)

WE COULD THEN EVEN TALK ABOUT STARTING A PUBLIC "FOR SALE" NEWSLETTER AND SELLING THE PICKS. I CLAIM THAT 90% OF THE PROS THAT ARE MAKING BIG MONEY ARE NOT USING THEIR OWN MONEY AS PRIMARY FINANCING. YOU CANT EVEN CONSIDER LIVING A DECENT LIFESTYLE AS A TRADER IF YOU HAVE LESS THAN 50-100K IN YOUR FOREX ACCT. READ MY PAST ARTICLES A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK TO SEE MY ACTUAL BREAKDOWN.  OR WE COULD START OUR OWN HEDGE FUND OR SOMEHOW SELL THESE PICKS. I PERSONALLY DO NOT HAVE 100K TO PUT INTO  A FOREX TRADING ACCT. IF YOU DO NOT, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME TRADING UNLESS YOU DO IT FOR LAUGHS OR EXTRA POCKET CHANGE!  WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR THINKING TO "MAKING MONEY FROM FOREX" NOT.."MAKING MONEY AS A TRADER."  Hint: Do you think the guys who made Forex Factory could care less what the market is doing? You think Nissan, Bigelow, Prechter and all the guys who got rich from trading actually got rich traing their own money? Maybe a few.............. a "few."  EVEN GANN WHO MADE THE SYSTEM UNDER HIS OWN NAME WAS SELLING IT FOR $1500 BACK IN 1932. WHY!!!?

Last year,  I won 11 out of 12 months and I am not close to making a living at this game. So why do you think so many competent traders are selling newsletters and memberships to trade rooms and conferences and God knows what else...........MAYBE THE MONEY IS NOT IN USING YOUR OWN CASH!

Anyone interested in starting up a room and/or thread where we do this, let me know. I wont do this unless we get enough people and they have to explain why they should be taken seriously and what they can contribute. iF YOU PM me and I dont get back to you, it means I stopped trading for a while, which I do 3 or 4 times a year. I WANT GUYS WHO CAN COMMIT TO THIS PROJECT FOR AT LEAST A YR. BESIDES, imho....., BEING A "PLAYER" IN FOREX CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH A LIFETIME COMMITMENT." Together we grow,alone we fail." But we start off with a professional blog or thread and keep a strict set of rules on when to show up in the chat room and how to pick our plays. Most of you could keep doing what you are already doing...just add in one more rule.

I also could use guys who can do web design, maybe build a nice blog on v-bulletin, a guy who can keep records of trades on paper as well on screenshots so we can look over every single loser together. (This is the most important thing any aspiring pro trader can do and less than 1% do this. Getting feedback from others who trade your way!)  When I was with a famous prop room, they told us "If you cannot explain why you took and why you lost, every single trade you took each day, YOU WILL NOT WIN AT TRADING!

MY GOAL IS NO LONGER TO BE A GREAT FOREX TRADER. I SEE THAT DOESN'T EQUATE INTO MONEY. MY GOAL IS TO GET RICH IN FOREX TRADING. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME THING!!!

Please dont talk about this here and get the thread all bigged down, just send me a private message if interested and what you can offer. We only need 5 or 6 committed guys. That is like a small Army in "this" game. How could we lose if 6 of us were contributing their brainpower to come up with one trade? I dont think we can if we stuck with it long enough!!! Im a net winner alone or with a team.Those of you who have seen my picks and screen shots and PM ed me to get my picks KNOW this for a fact.  But I'd much, much rather be on a team than alone.. "hint"

If you superimpose the 5EMA H&L on your channel of ema's they do not line up.  Please explain why the difference and does it really matter?  You might be getting some wrong signals since they do not line up.

Thanks for your indicator.

here's an idea for us all...

How about a Sunday afternoon (New York Time) rundown of pairs that look like there is an entry and why, or why not to take it.  Then, in order to avoid the typical Sunday night/Monday morning head fake, look to enter Monday evening if the trade still looks viable.

Thoughts or interest anyone??

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
good idea!

[quote=Silat50;6604131]{quote} Pprsper, I am the first to admit that the way "I" now trade it, the style did become discretionary. And I certainly understand how people would want exact rules. But I am also the first to admit that I am not willing to bet my entire trading acct on just these rules. The results in the beginning warranted it...the results now, while still good, do not. -) Dont get me wrong, I loooove this system, I just find that following the route of the bands rather than the previous bars h/l has become for me more profitable. And some weeks it is not. Im not the best trader here by any means. I just know when something feels "off" to me. And this system stopped being as dependable as it once was. Although I pity the guys who trade against it. (smile) What maybe you could propose to the board, is every one of us make up our own 7 system.

THEY KNOW DAMN WELL MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE SWING TRADERS PLACE THEIR STOP ABOVE OR BELOW THE PRIOR DAYS H/L, DONT YOU THINK? Do you have any other ideas?

Prosper, I admit that this system could not lose 2 trades in a row when it was introduced to us, but 2 months later, it seems the "only" way it could be profitable, was with discression. I must be honest and say that if by now i am not convinced it can work profitably by itself, yet work fabulously with a bit of descression....I want to trade that syste. Ive done very well with this system. First following it rote, then 2 months later with discxression. You bet Id like an automatic buy/sell follow the blue arrows type system. We almost had that here for a while....almost. bUT DONT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH-WATER! This system has huge potential. Its just way too symple, and way to easy in its stop loss system to just tweak a bit here and htere and walla! Has anyone even bothered to see what the results are if you allow 2 winning days before moving the stop?  No one has even done that much! So we really cant blame the system entirely.  -)

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
I'm to this thread, but I've been looking at this strategy, and it seems as if combining the trend, support and resistance, and candle stick patterns this could be a very powerful system. I've noticed whenever all three line up with the original rules of this strategy, this could be extremely profitable

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
I've been getting hammered with this system this week.  Anyone else doing OK?  Trying to determine what I'm doing wrong

Great post..nicely said .

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Welcome majj. First off, what exactly are you going to share with us. Where is it. The pozza is getting cold my man. lol  Secondly, the inventor of this system imho was not wrong to play many pairs. Just lok at the jpy. You think one pair did nearly as good as the USD against the JPY? nO.  But we ddint know that. We also didnt know that aud and cad wouldnt move together anymore and we didnt know the eur and gbp wouldnt either. Will they ever go back, who knows. Dofferent game with different players  and if you want to play as if nothing ever changes, and for the fibonacci boys they bet their life on that go ahead. Not me. Once the japs started interferring wit the natural order of things we never saw it coming....al the other markets changing behavior too. Besides this is a system to be played one chart at a time. You all know how well I do when I keep ot simple like that. I may not be back for a while. Good luck to all. I do say im a bit disappointed  that all weve got are guys either coming here for a week, not asking for any help and then leaving, or....guys who want to make the system better when they havent proved they can make it work in the first place. Between here and the 7 system picks thread have I ever had 2 losing trades in a row? Yet, its too much trouble to learn how I trade. I told all of you to keep a diary of every trade you take and we can discuss it in a chat room at end of week. Anyone do it?????????????  Then Paul leaves us abandonded here and just goes his own way, Talk about no love here at all.

Honestly, I need to be in a trading room where you have like 5 guys and everyone has an exact thing they are responsible to do. Just like a real Forex Hedge fund .What a concept. This aint funny guys. Alone we perish, united we stand. But isnt it best if you come in and show us your explorer first before you become the teacher. I did that already. My record here stands on its own. Just looking at my screen shots are pretty sick.

There are no rules for lower time frames. It is strictly done on daily. but please if you try it out keep us posted.

Hi Guys,

I've been using this system on binary trading and it's really doing well.

I don't care if the candle is outside or not...

All I do is trade the 15 minute time frame and trade with the trend on pull backs and look for the opposite cadle..

If the trend is flat I don't trade, it MUST be UP or DOWN.

Cheers !

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
binary trading brokers are very tricky, to say the least....who are you using?

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
I was using Binary.com with no probs then moved to a local one here in Australia highlow.net

The Australian regulations are very strict over here so I'm confident of High Low.
