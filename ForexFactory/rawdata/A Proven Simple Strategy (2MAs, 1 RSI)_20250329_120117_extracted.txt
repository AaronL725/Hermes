Hello everyone, Its been a while since I have posted but I wanted to share a super simple system that has been proven profitable. I hope this will help some of you here on FF. I did not create this strategy and it is nothing new. Its often overlooked because it's so simple but often times the simplest strategies can be the best. I have modified the original trading rules a little bit to rules that fit my trading style a little better. DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NO GRAIL. I AM NOT CLAIMING THIS TO BE A HOLY GRAIL. THIS IS JUST A SYSTEM THAT WORKS, THAT IS ALL. Things To Keep in Mind: 1. This is intended to be traded on Daily Charts. I will also post the results for other timeframes towards the bottom of the post(coming soon). 2. There is no Hard SL or TP to this system. I have not found any configurations using ATR or similar tools to place an SL &amp; TP that improved the system. As a result I do not use one with this system and just following the signals. 3. This system is not perfect. As with all systems, it performs better on certain pairs during certain conditions. What really allows you to take advantage of the system and avoid this variance is diversifying the instruments you trade it on!!! 4. Test results used a fixed lot size that does not increase. 5. Tests were performed on 7 major USD pairs(EU, GU, AU, NU, UJ, UCHF, UCAD). Thread Rules: 1. Do not add additional indicators. You may adjust current indicator settings and share your results if you'd like. 2. If you are going to suggest changes to the system, please provide hard evidence to support why these changes are profitable or better. 3. Keep it friendly. Please no spam. 4. Again no one likes conjecture. Do not make statements or claims about this system or any other system in here if you do not provide proof for the claims you are making. 5. Have fun &amp; keep learning! Entry Rules: Long: 1. Price is above 200 MA. 2. Price is below 5 MA. 3. RSI(2) is below 5. Short: 1. Price is below 200 MA. 2. Price is above 5 MA. 3. RSI(2) is above 95. Exit Rules: Option 1(This option is for people who just want to check the chart at the end of the day, This is the Option used in results below): Exit at the close of the candle that touches the 5 ma. Option 2(This is a better option for people who want to watch their trades like a hawk): Exit as soon as price touches 5 ma. So as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Well, here is my pudding, along with some other peoples pudding. The Pudding: In House Pudding: The first batch of pudding I will show you is my batch. Although there are other studies done about this system which I will share below, it is always smart to test the system for yourself before you even think about using it.

As I mentioned above it is key to diversify when using this strategy or others like it because some pairs will perform others as market conditions change. Diversifying will combat this variance as shown in the results above. Out Sourced Pudding: Attached File(s) RSI-2 Strategy Results.pdf 4.5 MB | 5,335 downloads Summary: As you can also see from these results, diversifying really helps this system by reducing the natural variance that will occur between individual pair performance.

Hi Sis.yphus, Thank you for sharing this system. This is my understanding of the system as introduced: Type : Trend following system, where trend is defined by MA(200) Entry : Entry on retraces captured by MA(5) and RSI(2). Exit : On touch of MA(5). The concept is good. Entry is fine, although one condition -either MA(5) or RSI(2)- could be enough. However for the Exit, I think we can manage better exits. And this is what I will try to prove in the coming days. I am not sure if you generated these tests manually or using an EA, Anyway, I will make an EA (if you don't mind), with the same concept and different exit options and see if we can get better results. Best, Khalil

'OVERALL RESULTS P/L: 3882.74(38.82%)' Initial Bank 70,000 (7 X 10,000) Profit 3882.74 (5.54%) Over 6 years = 0.92%/annum I'd find another hobby if I were you.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
It's a good strategy, but ... ....and the SL ??????????????????????

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This is a quick EA to test the system. I've added few options, but the default settings are as per Sis.yphus rules.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Dear all, simple systems can be the most profitable. Abo, thanks for the EA. Would be interesting to see the results. Perhaps test the EA with a fixed SL/TP (TP being &gt; than SL)? cheers

--- 帖子 #9 ---
How about an SL set at 10 pips above highest price of closed candle (candle which broke the 5EMA). TP could be set at the end of next candle. Sure your risk/ratio will not always be 2:1 but it's simple to define and a quick exit. For those looking to ride the trend, maybe using a SL set at half of the last closed candles range and just simply move it at the close when you are setting up your next entries. See attachment Thoughts?

Please show us a super rigid/mechanical systems like this that does not use any indicators along with proof that system works. Most price action traders are king snake oil sales men. And its always so convenient how their systems can't be proven but they can work... Again this is FIXED lot trading with a TINY account of 10,000. If you traded this system using a very large account(which most professional traders have money) you would have made a mint compounding your results. Also please show me a bank(U.S.) with 6% interests rate and I will quit investing all together, stick my savings in their and never work again.... With the lot sized used in the test you can trade all 7 pairs at the same time and not run into margin issues. In other words the same 10,000K can easily trade all 7 pairs at .1 lot size. ... Please read the thread. It is the second thing to keep in mind on the OP.... 2. There is no Hard SL or TP to this system. I have not found any configurations using ATR or similar tools to place an SL &amp; TP that improved the system. As a result I do not use one with this system and just following the signals. Also if that blue line is the 200 MA the trade you marked is invalid as price needs to close ABOVE the 200 and BELOW the 5. In the pic it is closing below both MAs .

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I really like where you are going with this and think this could have some legs. Rather than getting in to a flame war with some of the guys/gals on here, just use their critisizm and develop/evolv your system... I've learned a lot of things about myself and have become a better person over the years from harsh critisizm. Again, I like where you are going! Any other thoughts rgding SL's and TP's??

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hello Khalil! I personally have not found an SL that provides better results than not using one. And even with not using an SL the drawdown is still extremely low pair to pair. I do think a good one could be implemented as maybe a hard stop but then again the 5 MA catches up to the price very quickly. I am very interested in seeing what you find when using the SL. I am going to play around with the EA you posted and will share the results I find. Hello Shemski, As I mentioned to Khalil, I have not found any useful SL that works and I think it is crucial that the TP the is exiting on the touch of the 5 min MA. Here are some statistics on SL(based on pip size and market spread &amp; TP, so they do not directly apply to this strategy but they illustrate a point) that show the statistical disadvantages you face if you make them too small. This was posted on one of my old threads and it assumes the spread is .4(which most peoples is much higher so these numbers are much worse) Assuming Spread is .2 (5 Pip Target for 1:1) 1:.25 = 11 Pips For 5 Pips = 4 Pip Pay Out or 12 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread.

(10 Pip Target for 1:1) 1:1 = 7.6 Pips For 10 Pips = 8.8 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:1.32 - 8% Win Rate Needed To Make Up. 1:2 = 7.6 Pips For 18.8 Pips = 17.6 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:2.56 - 6% Win Rate Needed To Make Up. 1:3 = 7.6 Pips For 27.6 Pips = 26.4 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:3.63 - 5% Win Rate Needed To Make Up. 1:4 = 7.6 Pips For 36.4 Pips = 35.2 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:4.79 - 4% Win Rate Needed To Make Up. 1:5 = 7.6 Pips For 45.2 Pips = 44 Pip Pay Out or 8.8 Pip Loss After Commissions/Spread. - True R:R 1:5.95 - 4% Win Rate Needed To Make Up. As you can see by doubling the spread, the win rate needed to make up almost triples. So if you traded with a spread of 2 and a 10 pip stop on a daily chart, you are basically putting yourself at a minimum 20%+ disadvantage(in other words your winrate needs to be extremely high to trade a 10 pip stop system, especially on a daily chart). Again, these numbers are based on pip size and market spread &amp; TP, so they do not directly apply to this strategy but they illustrate the point I am trying to make anyways hope it makes sense.

FOR ALL THE LEVERAGE JUNKIES I have noticed a lot of people complaining about the returns demonstrated using extremely low leverage and risk... Well since most people on FF are looking to get rich quick or go busto trying, here are the results using super high leverage(I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TRADE LIKE THIS) and compounding the lot size based on the account size. USDJPY - 6 Years(2010-2015) - Spread = 2 Pips - Super Leveraged Trading with compounding lot size. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I agree, your win rate has to be very good but assuming you risk 1% of your portfolio per trade and using my above example, your SL would be around 25-28 pips. Your profit on that trade alone would've been around 145-150 pips. that is a 5-5.5% gain and at the end of the day your risk was only 1%/portfolio. I'll see if I can mess around with the EA and see what I can come up with...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
What was your position size here, 2-3% of protfolio?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I am getting a sell sign on both EUR/USD and Gold. I like both of those signals and by using my suggested SL's, I would set them here: EURUSD: 1.09945 Gold: 1098.26 I'll wait for spreads to thin out and take the trade a few hours after the open.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Good idea to wait for the spread to calm down. If you trade when the spreads are bad it will drastically change your results. I would recommend testing the strategy using your SL and TP idea and then reporting back the results. I may check it out and test it my self a little later today if I have time.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Will do! But again, shorting EURUSD and Gold is still a great gamble. Sidenote, you are def on to something, see attachment...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Yeah a big thing to keep in mind though, is when trading a strictly technical system, you need to take every trade generated as they come to get the true results of the system. Cherry picking the trades as you go will lead to quite a bit of variance in your performance, which can be good or bad. Sidenote: Haha thanks. The funny thing is though this thread will likely not get popular at all because it actually works but does not work good enough for most traders. Which then leads to the typical system hoping trader as they always are searching for something "better". These markets are already extremely brutal so sometimes it pays to just be good enough...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
At the end of the day, if you expect, aim for or truely believe that you can make anything more than 10% a month you will not survive long. I'll take 6% YTD with low risk any day! I'll try to keep this thread alive and if it does die out just PM me, maybe we can work things out by ourselves. Let those dreamers dream and watch them feed the market.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Indeed This is because most traders don't have the large capital to see the magic in this. So the hunt goes on...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Alright guys... This is for the fun, but I am doing some tests on the system in smaller time frames. Here are the results using super high compounding leverage on a 15 minute chart. Again I do not recommend trading extremely high leverage. EURUSD Jan 2010 to Dec 2015 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
how big leverage?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
What were your TP's and SL's?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
There is never a TP or SL on any order. The trade closes when price touches 5 ma.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hard to believe that only 3572 trades were placed during 5 years... I'd expect at least 10 trades aday,or did you limit the EA to certain trading hours?? *EDIT; my bad, i forgot about the RSI indy...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
My broker won't let me access data older than December 2015 (right now). Could someone run the EA on the EURCHF dated back to 2010? I'd love to see how it performed during the SNB's field-day...

Am I reading those settings correctly? SMA 20 EMA 5 RSI 2 - 70/30 ??

Very nice results, the following pairs are setting up for entries: AUDUSD EURAUD USDCAD GBPUSD EURGBP EURUSD Just a quick heads up for those looking to jump in.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
So, to trade this system, do we need at least $10,000, or could we use micro lots if we have less?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Don't need 10000

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks for the EA. Can you add Money Management?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Is you entry based on close above/below 5MA or on the cross?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
It is based on the close being below/above 5MA. It does not matter if it crossed the MA or not.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Ok Great. Thanks

Hi, great work and good strategy. I have a little similar with Stochastic but this one seems to be better in 2014,2013 etc. Please, can you add to EA also lot size in %. Thanks..

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Today is very lazy market. I am in optimalization process at the moment for 2007-2015. I will send my results later.. But after some tests the best TF for EU is H1 from my point of view..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I found this setting as the best for H1 EU, very low DD and very big profit factor:

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Dafa, could you post the tester results?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I get better results without the trailing stop on your settings

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Also better DD?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I can but later evening. I have no results in my computer at work.:-/

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The EA was provided for testing purposes. Where to go from here depends on the thread opener (Sis.yphus).

--- 帖子 #51 ---
My findings so far : The system is sound and can be applied to different time frames, although sys recommended Daily, my focus was mainly on H1 in order to get more trades. EUR/USD Test H1 2015. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Best Entry : - Open Long : RSI &lt; lower level, while Price above Slow Moving Average - Open Short : RSI &gt; upper level, while Price below Slow Moving Average Best Exit (when none of SL, TP,Trailing Stop used) - Exit Long: when price closes above fast moving average - Exit Short : when price closes below fast moving average EDIT : This test was run with Max Orders set to 3.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
The only problem is that this system, same as my Stochastic, has excelent results in 2015 but in the past it's not so good. I will try your setting evening.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Great stuff fellows! I've been manually back/front testing it with great results. You might also want to test the strat on a few indexes and commodities! Just a quick heads up!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Using a Stop Loss and Trailing Stop, and exiting on Trailing Stop instead of fast moving average, all other inputs are same as above, gave better results with less drawdown. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hello to everyone. Shemski Can you share some screen shot. Thanks in advance Regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I will try it evening. I think we need better modeling quality. I have 90% from 2007. Especcially if you use TSL.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
No problem

Sure, I'll get them online later.

Hello Abokwaik, Very nice results! a few questions if you don't mind. 1. How were you determining your stoploss?(ATR?) 2. How does the trailing stop work?(Is it stepped so it moves every x pips, or is it fixed so it is constantly x amount of pips away from the market at most?)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hey bro, can you please add compound interest filter to increase volume as acount increases, i think thats the last secret to this, compound interest has to be acording to ratio, meaning $10k=1lot $11k=1.1lot etc

--- 帖子 #61 ---
EDITED: Had bug in EA. Fixed so Updated results. I am still getting a lot more trades than you are. Hello Abokwaik, I am trying to replicate your results and am getting much different findings. I am using the same timeframe as you and it generates over 300 trades from Jan 2 2015 to Dec 30 2015 and the equity curve not very pretty. This is using a 7 &amp; 200 MA, 7 RSI(20 buy level &amp; 80 sell level), Spread is set to 30 and the modeling quality was 90%. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

And with my settings:

Here's an example of a DAX trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) I used the ADX as my exit indicator, simply waited for it to trend down. Now on this trade, I just happened to be in a meeting at 3:00PM and mised my exit. Luckely, the trend continued down and I exited shortly after (around 4:30-45). Same thing with the second trade: BUND, I got greedy here and just kept my SL close and exited a little later than my sign confirmed. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It could be really good to implement % lot size to see if results will be better.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
One more trade which was closed out last night while I was sleeping. My SL was at 1% of portfolio and TP at 1.5%. If I was up and watching, I most likely would've closed at the closing of that second candle and grabbed another 40pips which would've had me at 1.6%/portfolio. All in all, I placed 9 trades yesterday, 6 of them were premature (that's why I won't post them) and was up with all but one of them. Another great day and I must say the system feels good. I might just use this as my primary - manual trading system. We will see. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT: Waiting for my ADX to cross 25 on the DOLLAR index on the H1 chart. Keep an eye on this one on the 180/9 chart.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hello Sis.yphus.. Thanks for sharing your strategy, which looks promising. Also thanks to Khalil bro for the inputs. I think I'm a dumb coz I didn't understand clearly about the exit rules " Exit at the close of the candle that touches the 5 ma. Exit as soon as price touches 5 ma." Can you or anyone kindly post a screenshot of a trade pointing out the exits. Would be really helpful. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
This is version 2 of the EA, with Variable lot option. Risk Percentage is not included because SL is not fixed. So variable Lot size is simply calculated by multiply the "Balance (%) Auto Lot" input percentage by Current Balance and dividing by Required Margin. Example : Account Balance = 10,000. "Balance (%) Auto Lot" input = 6. Required Margin = 600. Var Lot Size = [(6/100)*10,000]/600 = 1. This the same test as the one in Post # 54 , with Balance (%) Auto Lot = 6, to start with the same lot size that test started with which was fixed to 1. I have also added two other RSI levels, so now we have 4 levels. 2 for entry and 2 for exit. For this test I've set them the same to be comparable with the previous test.

hi sis.yphus bravo very good work i follow

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I think you're using Simple Method while I used Exponential method for Moving Averages,

--- 帖子 #79 ---
so far would you say this is a good strategy or not, judging from your experience with EA's and the results we have?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
That's great job abokwaik.;-)

The strategy enters on retraces in the direction of the main trend . So in principle it is good. However, there are 2 issues that can make or break the strategy. 1. Correct identification of the main trend . Using MA(200) is one way, but how reliable is it (on different time frames). 2. Correct entry on end of retracement . Using OB/OS levels is one way, but how reliable is it. Few ideas to consider : Delayed Entry : option 1 : Instead of entering once RSI is above/below OB/OS levels, we delay the entry until we spot RSI divergence in the direction of the main trend option 2 : Instead of entering once RSI is above/below OB/OS levels,we delay the entry until RSI is out of OB/OS levels in the direction of the main trend Main Trend Identification: This is a big issue, and might require multi-time frame analysis.

As for modeling quality, this is a test with 90% I made on another PC. This test using Exponential MA: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And this one using Simple MA: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I dont know why but how i get different result from abokwaik with the same setting :| EDITED: wrong image, fixed

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Your Modeling quality is much lower than his, the reason why is most likely because of the quality of tick-data he is using compared to yours. I am guessing, if you were to DL better quality tick-data, your performance would be much different! @abokwaik; thoughts??

Thoughts on adding an ADX indicator? I've been trading manually with one and it get's the job done! SIDENOTE; Platinum is setting up for a sell sign on the H1 chart. Looking to short soon!

Different Required Margin on EUR/USD. Required Margin is determined by Leverage: Required Margin = (Current Price/Leverage)*Standard Lot Units. My leverage is 200, Required Margin on EUR/USD currently will be (1.0912/200) * 100,000 = 545 So when I set the variable lot Input to 6%, my starting lot was = (10,000*0.06)/545 = 1.1 It seems that your lot size was less because your leverage is lower. If your leverage is 100. Required Margin on EUR/USD currently will be (1.0912/100) * 100,000 = 1009. So you need to set the variable lot input to 12%, so that your starting lot size is similar to mine. I hope it is clear. Answer is above.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
As far as i know, modelling quality is just a matter of each broker pricing model and it wont affect the whole tested strategy, isnt it? &lt;-- not quite sure please correct me if im wrong. I just download the history data from my own broker history centre and this is the result from December 2007

--- 帖子 #88 ---
If you factor in spread, slippage, news etc...... would you say this strategy is profitable overall? remember backtests dont factor those things in.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
thumbs up!! yes i forgot FXCM provide lower leverage, thanks its clear for the differ result. Shall we proceed to discuss a far long term (2007 and lower) backtesting result

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Not without resolving the 2 issues I raised earlier. Defining the major trend is not a simple job. Most indicators depend on a number of previous bars, which are not of equal size. Using range bars, or combining multiple time frames, for trend definition could help. Another way could be to set the system to trade Only Long, or Only Short based on one's techno-fundamental bias.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Problem is that you never know how the market will looks like in the future. With my setting it's profitable from 2007-2016. It's good. Of course, in 2007-2010 it could be better. But if we do optimization fot that years so it's not so profitable in 2014 and 2015. What is more important? Last two years or 8 years back? It's a question. My idea is to use 2-3 different setting on the same pair. All profitable from 2007-2016 but one will be more profitable in 2007-2010, one 2010-1014 and the last one 2014-2015. If you use it all together maybe it could work like hedging or something like that. What do you think about it?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
For me as i learned to determine a major trend, i looked at D1/W1/MN1 candles and search for the latest ABCD pattern. Either it makes a zigzag to make a lower low and lower high (downtrend) or it makes a higher high and higher low. I think this kind of logic is tangible for coding. For a minor trend, go to H4 timeframe and below and search the latest ABCD pattern( HH and HL) or (LH and LL). Once a pattern formed, its the trend! Of course we never know my friend, but "every cow barn will smell the same over and over until the cow is replaced". We are looking the "red cable" that flowing through time to time in pricing especially forex market. That red cable is the main thing why Big boys e.g big banks are earning money time to time and increasing in growth. We need to have a rigid setting to make sure it will survive in any financial issues (global crisis, WW3, doomsday are out of factors of course). Some of my thought, would be glad to hear from yours

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Sir i think we are over thinking things here and trying to create a holy grail system which we all know doesn't exist instead of creating a simple system that will experience DD but overall will be profitable which is key, well with that said, let me rephrase my question to make it a little more accurate, looking at the beautiful backtests posted here, do you think it would have made at least similar results during the same months if it was traded live?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Definitely i agree with you! It costs me many $$$ to come a conclusion: a system with higher win rate does not guarantee a profitable system. All we need is a reasonable R/R and win ratio below 50% would be a sustain one

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Each system will experience DD, nothing is 100%, all we need is consistency, a system that will experience some DD but get up and keep moving farward CONSISTENTLY, i dont mind loosing a few battles as long as i will win the whole war, so here we dont mind loosing battles as long as we will win the war, i thing changing and rearranging is the worst thing a trader can ever possibly do, always wanting to be right and over analysis, its a killer of progress, each time we experience DD we seek to optimize and change and in turn we shoot ourself in the foot because we inturn mess with the mathematics and the statistics, so we can never actualy be sure if something works or not because the variables within the strategies are always changing before we can even gather enough data for analysis, so all i wana know is will this perform similar to the backtests during a farward live tests, thats all that matters to me.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
With regard to the tested pair, with testing settings: spread, slippage, re-quotes would not change the results to a loss. So if you ran the system on EUR/USD with my settings for 2015 you will end up with profit. BUT, is that enough ? In my opinion, (and this is applicable to any system), it is NOT. This was IN-SAMPLE Testing, with only 42 trades over only 1 year. Lets go out side the sample just a LITTLE bit, same pair, same settings, 2 years back. This is the test for 2013. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
This is why I wrote my idea about bundle of settings. And runing it together. My settings I tested with data 2007-2016 and imho the results seems better. But probably we need someone with StrategyQuant or similar software because in MT4 there isn't possible to do this type of backtest.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hello Khalil, Is it possible to separate the faster moving average to ema(Highs) and ema(Lows)? So that the EA can exit longs at ema(highs), exit shorts at ema(Lows). Thanks....

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Larry Williams style ;-)

--- 帖子 #101 ---
though I'm no expert coder or tester, I think we need first to prove that the system works over different pairs and periods before tweaking the settings like lotsize or ema high-low. MA settings, Rsi settings, SL/TP/TS are the things we should look at. But first we need to make sure our test results are reliable (modelling quality, mismatches, journal errors....). All easier said than done...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Very good point. As I mentioned in the first post. What makes this system work well is when it is traded very diversely(on a bunch of different pairs or a basket) because it will perform better on certain pairs at different times. But if you trade a bunch of them at once they should average each other out and create a very smooth equity curve. As said by fti in another thread , "studies(or systems) can work in some market conditions all the time, all market conditions some of the time, but not all market conditions all of the time." This system or any system will not work on every pair all of the time. Thankfully with a properly designed system it doesn't have to and the pairs that work during certain times will pick up the slack of the pairs that are not working as well.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
http://www.easyexpertforex.com/backt...imization.html bumped onto this site. Interesting (to me at least, maybe basic knowledge for others) They discuss how to correctly optimize, then backtest in MT4 and how to forward test. Just fyi. I will have a look as soon as I can give myself some spare time. I don't want to dismiss this strategy (nor use it for real) without solid proof.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Outstanding link!!!! Thank you!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I am glad that you are interested in BT but what do you think we are doing here all the time? Beach voleyball? I spend a lot of hours/days with proven bactest of this strategy. Try it. Only EURUSD will take you few days of your live. It's not necessary to write here how we can make a quality backtest. It's for another thread. If you haven't any good reason to show us some improvement then just look, download and use it. I don't know how long have you been on forex market but there isn't any solid proof. Just history and prediction or hope of similar move. Do you have courage use it under this conditions?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I have been testing&amp;optimizing AUDUSD and GBPJPY . Seems to be good pairs for this strategy in long term as well.

This simple system looks good in the past, well done. No- the reason why the banks, institutions and hedge funds are the smart money and making money is they do not use technical analysis to generate trading ideas, but instead use it as a timing tool and filter... They have a systematic approach in gaining a trading bias. For the Forex markets it's understanding every detail about the countries - all the boring economic stuff that 99% of people won't look at, with out this fundamental knowledge you won't know where the economy is going or what factors are going to influence policy makers to change and intervene. If you understand this, then using technical analysis for timing and understanding where the smart money, excluding commercial hedging, is on certain currencies (net long or net short) you will be in the trade with the right bias, in the right direction, with the smart money and earlier before the dumb money reacts to the news; that's when the dumb money provides liquidity to get out. E.g) If you are reading the NFP and making a trading decision, or are even "surprised" vs. last months NFP, and believe what the retail brokers and news media tells you, you are already 3-4 weeks behind the banks and institutions on that figure and around 9-12 months behind on a trading bias.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
That was random...

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Shemski, I have some questions comparing your trades and the settings. - The lot size is set to 3 but I see trades taken for 1,5 or other sizes. - The Trailing stop (and shift) is set to 10 but you have a 5-digit broker. Shouldn't it be set to 100? BR.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi X Great eye! -I was initially trading 1.5 lots but my largest losses were only about 1%/portfolio so i decided to double the size. -Yes it should, but for some strange reason, 10 gave me the best results. Don't ask me why. Have you been back/front testing the strat? If so, let me know what your thoughts are! I am currently trying to find the optimal variables for index trading. I'd love to set this system loose on the S&amp;P, Dow, Nasdax, etc...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Shemski, I forgot to ask, on what TF did you put the EA and how many pairs? I will try to set it up next Monday. One more question: do you have different Magic Number for each pair?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Outstanding results. H1 TF?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Magic Number should be unique per PAIR instance. So for example, if you're using the EA on EU, EJ, GU, UC, AU, GJ you don't have to change the Magic Number, as these are different pairs. While if you're using the EA on EU M5, EU M30, EU H4 , then you'll need 3 different Magic Numbers.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks Abo.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
All trades were placed on H1. I honestly have not been able to find decent variables for other TFs? I'll play around with it this weekend. BTW, thank you sys.yphus for the intro and to all of those who have been helping evolve this system!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
The name of this thread says it's a proven system please explain to me where you get the fact that it's proven

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Good to see sis back here. System is trading the exhaustion of the pullback/retracement against the longer term trend. The RSI settings of 95,5 are extreme over bought/sold levels. Statistically price can't travel much further...... unless it is a true reversal. Also, RSI has a tendency to get stuck at the top/bottom of its range, that's why Blau modified it to create the TSI. Agree with the TF issue as on a D1 chart you are basically trading when price is above the weekly (MA5) level vs roughly the yearly (MA200) trend. On lower TFs the system is going to be a lot more sensitive to individual market sessions and the intraday volatility of individual currency pairs. May be harder to calibrate the same MA settings to hold across a basket of currencies on lower TFs. Dunno, just speculating here. Have not tested anything. Nothing wrong with the logic of the system as people's testing have shown. I only trade the T1/M1 and measuring exhaustion points for either impulse moves or retrenchments are key me.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks for the input. I've spent a good 10-15 hours crunching the numbers this weekend and have noticed that certain TF's work better on ccertain pairs. What stuck out the most was the fact that all of my best backtesting numbers came from M15 or M30 charts and not one of the indices or commodoties setups were NOT on a M15 or M30 chart. Just something to keep an eye on. I really do not feel like listing every single pair, commodity and TF I am front testing but for the non-lazy, it is not hard to find the "sweet spot". Good luck this week everyone! Cheers

Hi, I have always been a fan of the KISS principle and the rules for this simple trading strategy I believe is all that is required to be a successful . I shall be trading 24 currency pairs from Monday using the settings from the EA supplied that is how confident I am of this gift that has been given. Cheers to the trader who started this thread and to all contributors. All the best from a NZ trader.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I think you definitely need a SL or TS with this system. Because: if you go long when price is below the fast MA and price keeps going down, it will remain below the fast MA and this could be painful in case of a waterfall. So we need a SL or TS instead of the MA exit rule I think.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Only if you money management is extreme.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Can you explain in more detail what you mean?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
The bias is more towards win in trend trading. loss will happen the fast is you loss manager greed ruins the statistic and DD make pain in greed. the MA is dependent on price not the other way around. Test it first. Then comment and show a chart of your findings

--- 帖子 #133 ---
He means the issue of not using an SL &amp; TP on this system is not really an issue if you are risking the proper amount per trade. The 5 MA will catch up to price quickly in all conditions, especially if you are trading with the 200 MA.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks Sis.yphus

Anyways, thank you both guys. Been testing today 20/5 sma, rsi 2 80/20 no fixed Sl/tp/ts. And so far so good Tbc...

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Test for no shorter that 3 months per setting. Test the original setup as well. Just let them run on a free VPN and check it in a month. The strategy tester basically lets you know the EA is performing as expected. Now throw it on demo or a very micro account and let the market give what it gives... Pay attention the spread. Green pips brother!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Is this avoidable? Did anyone else had this trade? Probably a news release... FYI, settings M15 20/5 MA, RSI (2) 80/20, no SL/TP/TS, exit of fast MA I added the MA 5/20/200 as well as the RSI (2) levels 5/20/80/95 The trade would have been taken with 200/5 MA and 95/5 RSI too, but a bit later. Happy testing fellows. PS: Maybe an exit on cross of the slow MA (200 in that case) would be a beneficial safety net. To be tested...

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Yes, Xman. It's avoidable. There is an option to close on cross of slow MA.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Today I have been testing Ea on small live accounts and there are big differencies in profitability. On account activetrades with good spreads (EU around 0.7pip) is in profit today. On account F4U with normal spread (around 1.5pip) it's not in profit with the same trades on eurusd. Slippage is on activetrades usually also better.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi abokwaik! Thanks for the EA. I test it with a basket of 7 pairs. Settings as post 82 but 30 min. Close basket with 100 pips tp/sl. Tested it for 2 days. So long everything is god, 3 basket closed with tp. But when does ea takes 3 orders? Today 3 orders whas executed with gu, the first when rsi(7) breaks 20, with the second order whas rsi(7) below 20. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanks Abo, I modified my settings: testing on 6 pairs now, 15m TF: SMA 200/5, RSI (2) 80/20 (i find 95/5 to extreme for now), exit at fast MA cross or slow MA opposite cross. I'll post updates.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
It takes a new long position on each new bar open, as long as rsi is &lt; 20 and total orders &lt; max orders.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Ok thanks, I understand, rsi dont have to break 20.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Abokwaik, Apparently the the trade will not close on the same candle as the one it opened with (i.e. the open candle crosses and closes on the other side of the fast MA). Can you confirm that it will wait for the close of the candle after the open candle, based on the EA coding?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
It's been mentioned that various set files do not do well in certain years, 2013 in particular. With over 100 backtests, I was able to find a set that was able to make a good profit in 2013, 2014, and 2015, as opposed to prior sets that failed to prove robust enough to make money each of the three years. I also found that running the EA on M5 was key to getting things right. Modelling quality is 90%, with no mismatched chart errors, for the year 2013. No claims being made as to how it would do live, but it could be a good starting point.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
yes as you move down in time frame the degree to which spread affects you trading drastically increases as shown in the example of the first page(one of my post on there). This is why if you choose to trade on smaller timeframes, you need to make sure you only trade when the spread is small enough for you to still make a profit. Contrary to popular belief, beating the markets is quite easy. What is really hard to do is beat the cost of trading... A lot EA's are profitable if the spread is small enough.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I wanted to share a pic to explain what I mean by variance and why you should really diversify when trading. As I said, this system, like all systems, will perform differently during different market conditions for each pair. Take a look at the picture below and image each line represents the trading results from 20 different pairs we trade. Attached Image The black solid trend line represents what your equity would look like as the performance of all the pairs plays out(the green lines are just some Deviation intervals to show where we can expect most of the pairs performance to land). As you can see we have nice growth by diversifying and averaging the returns of all the pairs. If we traded only 1 pair, we could expect results that look like any of the lines representing the pairs performance. Yes we could see very good results while we trade only 1 pair, but we could also see horrible results. In fact you could experience losing results multiple times over using a profitable system. And If you were to see these horrible results while only trading 1 pair at a time, you would say this system is BUNK! But in reality you are just experience a very bad period of variance. In order to reduce the amount of variance in performance you need to DIVERSIFY!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thank you...Good information sys.yphus could you give me a material or direct link to learn more about this subject

--- 帖子 #157 ---
This could have ended badly. If the slow SMA got hit it would have exited with a loss on all trades. Now more or less BE. Max number of trades was set to 6 (per pair). For the rest, running well. Since my exits are the cross of fast MA (usually a profit) and slow MA (usually a loss), and since the slow MA is usually further away from current price than the fast, I guess my losses will be larger. We'll see if the %winning trades can make up for that. For now, they do: about 65-70% trades are won, about 200$ profit with fixed 0,1lots after 100 trades or so over 24h on 6 pairs.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I would not recommend opening more than 3 trades per setup. Once you move past 3 it can get dangerous and like you mentioned your losses will seriously stack up. I also have never used entry level of 80 or 20( I prefer 5 and 95) so I can not comment on how well it will perform. I am very interested to see how it plays out for you though so please keep us updated!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Almost all 2-3 days profits were lost with this sudden move in USDCHF and EURUSD . I thought that the exit on the slow MA occurred at the cross, but apparently it occurs at the close of the candle that crossed (or even opening of the next one). If we want (I do )) the Slow MA to be our safety net, then the EA should be programmed to exit at the cross (or we should work with a fixed SL or TS, but that's more difficult to determine).

--- 帖子 #160 ---
interesting bro, can you please post set file

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hello Abokwaik, It seems there is a problem, the position should have been stopped on fast MA. Thank you

--- 帖子 #162 ---
You mean slowMA. Yes, there's a problem It never closed past the fast MA, so not closing of the trade.

no I mean fastI just added the slow as true but when the trade was opened it was false

EA closes a Sell trade if candle close below fast ma. And closes a Buy trade if candle close above fast ma.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
maybe you could add an option to close on touch of the ma?Tx

--- 帖子 #167 ---
today on 5mn TF

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Maybe an also some an angle parmater for the long MA. Just an idea. TX for your work. S

--- 帖子 #169 ---
add an angle parameter for the long MA i mean

--- 帖子 #170 ---
The close trade when candle closes on other side of fast MA is ok, but as a safety net and to avoid sudden large moves the trade should better close at the moment it crosses the slow MA (not at the candle closure). I think...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Right. Thank you all for your input. I will try to furbish a new release for next week. HAve a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I like the strategy. Checked out the daily charts and some nice returns and quite safely. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thanks Abo, that would be great. I think the system makes sense, but trading it with real money without a SL will not be easy psychologically. That's why I prefer to have a safety net in place. And waiting for the candle close beyond the slow MA may be too late. Maybe closing at the cross will drastically decrease the win ratio, but we won't know until we test it out. So, I look forward to the update and will test with same settings. Then depending on the results, play around with RSI and number of open trades, if needed. Meanwhile, enjoy your weekend.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
So far i noticed that better trades are when price are far from the fast ma Maybe add a distance filter. Thanks Abo

Great work. I've been playing around with this system for a few weeks with some decent results. i'm in the phase of finding out which TF works best forme along with a few minor tweeks. Why don't we try to put together a coordinated team and asign certain people to certain duties? For example, I'd be willing to front test 5 or 6 majors, along with Gold and Oil, maybe the Dax and S&amp;P on a H1 chart with the following variables: EMA's; 20 &amp; 5 RSI; 2, 95 and 5 along with 2, 92 and 8 One side note, this system CAN NOT live be when spreads are wide. I've noticed during the past few weeks that Sunday and Friday evening entries have killed me! Good luck everyone this week!

Hi all, I like the EA it is nice and simple and seems to work. Below I have been doing some tests on the EUROUSD and GPBJPY. Below are the settings I was using on the H1 and the results are good but there is an issue on the SL's not being able to be applied. Attached Image Here are the results and they are fairly good based on the numbers and the percentage of trades is also good based on the qty of trades. EUROUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here you can see the graph and where the losses come in and the SL's don't get applied from what I can see. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see in July the issues come in and wipe out allot of the profit in a few trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Is there no way to get the trailing SL to update faster not when the candle closes?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
started testing EA with original settings on 12 pairs,first position opened,lets see,wery promissing EA

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Is there anyway we can limit the time that the EA trades?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
opened eur/usd trade by EA.I think wery slose to 200 MA (green line),that not be good,maybe need some filter if so close not to take trade,second trade usd/cad was ok

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Why are you using a 78 and 9 RSI Entry level? Shouldn't that either be 78 and 22 or 91 and 9??

Would the developer of ex4 file, please, provide the mq4 file for this EA?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Why ? If you are not a developer you don't need it. If you are a developer you can simply make a better one.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I wouldn't mind it as well. I am not a developer but I can get by on the basics. The main reason I would want it so I can set the EA's trading days and hours.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I like this system, it is very promising, there is some nice catches, but you need to close some trades manual like this one EURAUD from +50 pips close on loss.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Vera what settings are you using, can you post a screenshot. Could you not use a Trailing SL to help with those?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
strange, if i enable the SL to be optimized while the backtest, i don´t get a result but this message in the journal SL is set to be backtested with values between 10 and 100

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Don't test with my settings i test already. Try other settings.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
This is an optimization test on EUR/USD 2015/2016 H1, SL between 100 points (10 pips) and 1000 points (100 pips) with step of 100 points (10 pips) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

i am a developer and want to improve this one without needing to reinvent the wheel! Please, anyone?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Would be nice to have time frames so we can limit trading times, most of the losses that come are in trades that happen in early hours of the morning when ideally we can just turn off trading. Also the spreads at this time would not be good in any case so we wouldn't want to trade then. Hard to back test properly with out this. Quite interesting how much of an effect the stop losses are making. It is really hard to know what stop loss to put in place. Look below. This is with starting capital of $500. USDJPY Settings below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here are results of trailing stop loss, changing the size and the shift. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

36H results from setting in post 178: not good. I'll go back to my original settings which were good (% winning trades) except for some large losses i.e. use SMA instead of EMA (and closing price, not H/L) and only using the cross for the slow (and close for the fast). So: TF15min, 6 pairs, 3 trades/pair max, no SL/TP/TS, SMA 200/5, RSI (2) 80/20, exit on close fast SMA or on cross slow SMA. If that doesn't work, the initial good results were due to luck... (not for myself: starting at 4253 $)

--- 帖子 #208 ---
i agree

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Xman43 out of interest what time were your losses?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
For people asked for Trading Times input, this version (4) includes start and end hour, used only for entry. While close can be at anytime as per the other inputs.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi abokwaik, pls, can you modify time filter. There is some problem if start time is bigger than stop time. I mean - I would like to test EA only during asia session. I am from Europe and Asia session for me is from 23 to 5, during night. When I try to set start at 23 and stop at 5 it doesn't open any trade but when I set from 1 to 5 it works. Thanks David

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Sir, Firstly thanks for all sharing. Could you, add a optional TP point. For example, If 5 &amp; 20 EMA cross then it will TP. ( EMA or SMA etc and value things are optional it )

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Sorry. This is beyond system description.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Its a bit tricky, but I will try.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
This one should be OK.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Great.;-) If we use it only during asia session the results are better, lower DD and nice equity..

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Abokwaik, im intesrested to testing this version on post 7, can you compile this version with metaeditor build 765? i can help here for making backtest with modeling quality 99,9% but unfortunately i can tested if compile with newest metaeditor this is metaeditor 765: Attached File(s) metaeditor.zip 3.8 MB | 460 downloads this is example my backtesting Attached Image (click to enlarge)

UPDATE: Settings look better. Lots of small wins, some bigger losses though when price moves straight to the slow MA. Will limit the number of trades to 1 per pair. Should be safer. (Starting at 4250$)

can you post results please?

Hi There, I trade always using a 1% stop loss as the bench mark to every losing trade.Can this input be added as part of the money management. Cheers !!!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi Acana, I am forward testing but am not very skilled at doing reliable backtests (knowing that the data from MT4 are not always accurate). I noticed you had 99% modeling quality and no mismatched bars! Could you maybe backtest with my live settings on TF15min? If not, no pb. BR. TF15min, SMA 200/5 (simpleMA-CLOSE price), RSI (2) 80/20 (95/5 may be worth testing too), 0,1 fixed lots, max 1 trade per pair Open signal = CLOSE of candle Close signal = CROSS of slow SMA or CLOSE past the fastMA No TP/SL/TS

I am currently testing the following settings on 7 pairs on a demo account. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pairs Testing on can be seen below and in the trade explorer. USD/CAD9.8% $485 USD/JPY4.0% $190 GBP/JPY-0.5% -$26 EUR/USD-0.7% -$41 USD/CHF-2.3% -$117 EUR/GBP-3.7% -$191 GBP/USD-8.5% -$439 It has been very up and down, wining percentage has not been as high as back tests. Setting up some Virtual machines in my server farm so I can leave different strategies testing. Current test results. Trade Explorer : The Gambler Autobot It has been going for 3 days. Acana, can you back test these settings for me and see if you get different results. I was hitting an average of around 65% win rate on back testing and you can see my win rate now is 45%.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi, which TF do you test? From my backtests only H1 is profitable. Lower TFs doesn't work with any setting. I have been testing on live account TF H1 with EURUSD and EURJPY. But there wasn't any signal last few days.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
What kind of MAs are used for this? Simple, exponential, smoothed...or? Another question is when does a new candle begin on the daily chart? What time and what time zone? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
all settings in the screenshot, simple.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Update after 36h: Breaking even since starting this strat 72h ago (max 3 trades/pair), small profit since reducing max number of trades to 1/pair. Too early to draw conclusions. Will continue the test next week with same settings.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thank you Xman.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Acana, Looking at your 1H chart I have a couple of questions: - I see max 10 trades per pair: I think this would be hard to do with real money if the trade goes against you. Maybe try with 1 or 2? - I see you use a % of balance. This skews the results a bit and is probably the reason the chart is exponential. Maybe check what it gives with a fixed lot size? - Is there a stop loss ? The only exit seems to be the RSI (unless I'm mistaken). Am I correct? This could be painfull when price keeps falling down / up. A general question: is there a way to know the maximal floating loss (ie unrealized loss) with MT4 strat tester?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Subscribed! Greatest Yesterday I found this page https://www.tradingview.com/chart/CE...sing-Win-Rate/ and searching for more information I see this thread, I like this strategy that is totally mechanic, today I will do some manual back testing, keep studying, we will beat the market!!! $yl

--- 帖子 #248 ---
not sure if you can setup this EA to exactly built this strategy, but if you find a way post the *.set file! i will try also

--- 帖子 #249 ---
ok, this is result as your request base on what you quote picture is default setting on EA maybe more easy if you attach setfile, so i just load to EA Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #250 ---
for floating loss maximum, you can see at *) Absolute drawdown — the largest loss is lower than the initial deposit value *) Maximal drawdown (%) — maximal loss of the local maximum in the deposit currency and in percents of the deposit

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi, I would like to try this manually too. Please could someone post an alert setup for the Moving Average and RSi Indicators? Thank You Afzal

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Thanks, Maybe it's the way.;-)

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hello, i did a quick backtest from 1st january 2015 until today, only gbp/usd daily tf. 200sma, 5sma, rsi2. (price above 200 sma and rsi below 10 buy, exit only if the price closes above the 5sma or below 200sma; price below 200sma and rsi above 90 sell, exit only if the price closes below the 5sma or above 200sma) http://content.screencast.com/users/...02-07_1600.png http://content.screencast.com/users/...02-07_1605.png I know that one year is very short time for backtesting, anyway i cannot do much manually. If i trade around 20 pairs daily tf, the average return would be quite nice, what do you think? Syl

--- 帖子 #254 ---
(1) Drawdown% is high --&gt; dangerous. (2) Max Drawdown &gt; net profit --&gt; risk &gt; return.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yes actually you are right, not nice idea. I am back testing with your EA that I like very much, congratulation! Nice job!Until now I see that the profitable time frames are only 4hr and daily tf.I will post some back test soon.$yl

--- 帖子 #256 ---
i just did a backtest with same settings and "only" got this result. Is there really such a big difference between 90% and 99% modeling quality?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Uuuuh, let's start with the variable "spread". Huge difference between current and your 30. Don't want to waste my time comparing the rest. Maybe you can do that... As a matter of fact, you should've already done that.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hello, is it possible to risk a fix percentage of the capital, compounding it? For example i would like to risk 1% per trade of the actual capital. I cannot do that. http://content.screencast.com/users/...02-07_1934.png There is some bug? Thanks for info! Syl

--- 帖子 #259 ---
your right, the spread was different. but even with spread 14 the results differ a lot

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hello, i did some backtest on daily tf, rsi2 (90-10), from 2010 until today, the results are pretty much randomly... not so promising...

On daily tf the only good one is usdjpy

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Model quality, time span??

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Model quality: point of control (since we open and close the trade at the close of the bar, i don't think would be differ from "every tick". Time span... what do you mean?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Just post the complete strategy report rather than screenshots of the MT4's graph.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
yes its make big different, even just 0.9% its make different, and watch your data spread, my data conversion for alpari that have average spread 1.4 pips, lowest under 1 pips

--- 帖子 #266 ---
The test was made with a start of 400 euro, trading with 0,01 lot. I didn't save the report, the graph speak very well.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I see 60-80 trades but those trades couldbe over a time span of 12 years or 12 hours. That is what I mean by time span and by model quality, imean tick data quality.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
From 2010 until today, model quality is "point of control, not the very accuraty tick data".

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Looking at the charts, the rational of this strategy seems odd. You are betting on price going away from the long MA. Why not try this: buy when price below slow MA and RSI &lt;x (e.g 5) (close when RSI &gt;y (e.g. 80)) sell when price above slow MA and RSI &gt;a (e.g. 95) (close when RSI &lt;b (e.g. 20)) If you look at the charts, it seems to work... It would require another EA since this one buys when price is above long MA. Just something to think about. I'm sorry if this is off-topic (if someone knows such an EA, please post the link, thx)

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Abokwaik, I have some problem with EA on live account. It doesn't open trade on Friday and I found in log message about problem with lot size. I have 2% in setting, with 0.0 fixed lot size. Strange is that in backtest it works but in live forward no.. Do you have some idea why? I use version of EA without time filter.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Xman, The logic of this strategy is the following: 1) Trade with trend (Slow MA) 2) Locate drawbacks (Price between slow and fast MA) 3) Locate over bought/sold markets with RSI

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Thanks Shemski, I get it now (I made the stupid assumption that price tends to revert to the mean, when in fact it's the mean that follows the price). So, in essence it makes sense, we just need to have a better risk/return%. The TP at the cross or close of the fast MA is usually only a few pips away since the price is never far away from a 5MA. So profits are small. While losses, when using the slow MA may be bigger. Maybe we don't even need the fast MA. When price is above the slow and RSI plunges, we go long. So maybe we can test a fixed TP/SL (1:1 ; 1,5:1 or 2:1 ratio). 15/10pips, 20/10, 30/15....? Any suggestions from anyone? I'm willing to forward test based on 'promising' backtest results.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Impressive for a diversified strategy. Would like to test the longest back-test possible. Preferably 30 years. Not sure how to do this yet, but would also, like to test this on as many unrelated currency pairs as possible on the same account at the same time...To diversify.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
not need more than 6 months to test,why you want test 30 years,for fun?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I have a strange one not sure if any one can assist why this would happen? I am testing the same system on 3 different brokers from 3 different locations on virtual servers I own. I have only just turned on OANDA and when I turned it on it took a trade for NZDUSD where all the criteria were not met. So the price was below fast and above slow, but it was not below RSI low. The trades were not made on my other two brokers. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any idea how that could happen, will keep monitoring it. Let me know what you think?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Just having a look at what is happening with one of my trades which are currently in action with Supa's Set file. Below you will see my screenshot showing the Slow MA, red dotted line. If we had the option enabled to exit on crossing Slow MA then we would have been out of this trade. But maybe Supa wouldn't have won on other trades that crossed the Slow MA so it is hard to tell what to do here but lets wait it out and see where it closes? Supa, Let me know what you think if you have been watching your trades have you seen go bad like this and swing from this? I see it has started to swing which is quite interesting to watch.

Ok, I 've been playing around with this EA for the last couple of days and live demo trading . I'm currently testing following strat that 'kinda' looks good but it's still too early to tell. I tried to backtest in excel and it seems ok but I still need to verify my formula's The idea is, go with trend (200 SMA), entry based on RSI, fixed SL (15pips), TP based on RSI. Maybe someone can backtest these settings ....?

--- 帖子 #293 ---

You can calculate let say 5% of your capital in pips and put it in the setting just to be sure that in the worst case you lose that amount of money leaving enough room to let the setup works,Anyway in my backrest that file.set doesn't give good result, I am trying to play with the setting and time frame in order to have better results,Syl

--- 帖子 #308 ---
in forward testing we getting very good results.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
It's a very good system. It shows realy good results in some pairs with some settings, but still need some modifications. My set is with 5 max open orders. First modification: If EA open more than 2 orders next orders to be twice more than first two. Example: If 1 and 2 open orders are with lot size 0.01 next 1,2 or 3 to be 0.02. Or if first two orders are with 1% from the account size the next orders should be with size 2%. Second modification: Will be good if have minimum distance between orders. Example: When EA open order, the next open order should have minimum distance in pips from the first open order.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Antonio, Would you mind taking a screen shot of your settings. The reason I ask is because I tried to replicate your last few results (backtest), but am unable to get the same results. I downloaded the zip file from post 284, but am obviously doing something wrong. Thank you. Regards The Wolf

--- 帖子 #311 ---
p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; I have three same problem!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
You're first point is a kind of martingale that blow the account when you have a losing row!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Here is the account loss with no SL in 2013 using Suppa .set... so need stop loss. Whoever can code it and add Swing Stop Loss is the best option for this.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Lol of course you need SL. Your SL and TP is EXIT on Fast MA . And the most distant orders 3,4 and 5 will have max profit and less loss.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Finally some one else gets that just because you not using a fixed SL does not mean there is no SL... Also I do not recommend opening so many orders(more than 3) unless you entries are less likely to occur(will post more on this in a bit with some pics). Im glad to see people realizing that some of the simplest systems can provide a very nice edge. No fancy indicators, no black box code, etc. Just what the "evil" broker gives you.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Not enough. What if market drops 200 points in 10 min, Fast MA will not get in time to stop u out Post 313 at the end of the graph had 230 points Stop out...see last entry below

--- 帖子 #317 ---
There is other filters too in that EA that you can use for SL and TP. Use Exit on cross opposite slow MA for example. I can give you idea for other filter too. If all conditions are met, but previous closed candle is in oposite direction EA should wait till previous closed candle is in that direction and then open order.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Things to Consider When Changing RSI Settings: I have noticed a lot of you have been playing around with the RSI period setting and have been having some good results. Something I want you to consider when changing the RSI settings and levels you enter at is how frequently they are likely to occur. Since we are trading with the trend(200 MA), if at any point in time when price is above the MA, we look at the frequency distribution of the RSI there will also be a fat tail towards the higher readings(lower readings if below 200MA). So we know that when we are trading with the trend long, we are looking for pull backs in the RSI towards the lower numbers, the signals that are least likely to occur. You want to get in the market where it goes least often(lower RSI Reading) and get out where it goes most often(Average of price in this case). Statistically and logically this is a very sound method. Now lets look at some RSI readings starting with the original RSI setting of 2 for a period where price was moving down overall. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As we can see there are a total of 3747 RSI readings in this example 247 of which would be valid entry signals based on the original rules I posted. Roughly 6%. If you use levels lower than 95 you will get a lot more entry signals many of which will be back to back. This is why I said its important to understand how often they are likely to occur before you decide you are going to add every time they occur. Here is how the RSI is distributed for a few different settings all where the price is decreasing overall.

This is why I did not want to post fancy charts exploding with results using high leverage and why I still do not put charts like that in the original post. I had to though as no one took it seriously. Reduce your leverage dude. Trading a system like this, unless you are using a tiny account that are okay blowing, Id recommend risking 1% every 100 pips price runs against you. So if you have $1000.00, you would trade .01 lots per entry. Slow safe money means low risk, and you will need a bigger balance to start making real money from it. Fast dangerous money means high risk and you will possibly lose it all at any point. If this is how you like to trade you need to approach it using the Saints Free Account Method.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Of course you will blow your account. In forex trading most important thing is money managеment. Your took to much risk with small account on backtest. And that you blow your account with your settings does not mean will blow with every settings. You need to find the right one. I found these that are good for me and for that i give ideas for other options in that great EA.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Yea 3 orders is a good option too. And still the last 3-rd order, if is twice much more than previous 2 will have max profit, if deal is on profit and less loss, if go against you. And, if there is filter for minimum pips distance between orders will be good too.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi wolf, Now i'm out for weekend an i can't send the picture of the settings, but are the same like supa, exactly the same.I put it in a demo acount and the result is good for the moment.The stop and profit is the moving average.I hope i help you.Chers

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I hear you about money management, I started with 1 lot per $10,000, 2nd trade was 2nd lot i guess....it is not that bad leverage Here it is with 0.6 lot per $10,000...look in the middle drop 30% of the account

--- 帖子 #324 ---
You are using 6 times more leverage than I said... Reduce it to The proper amount I recommended and that loss would be less than 5%.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
and then you will be 120(hopefully healthy also) years old to make few bucks.... I do not think 0.5 lot per trade per $10,000 is too much, but you get 30% drop on the account on 2 trades Here is the performance of the Suppa and actually best setting that worked great in 2015, during 2011 - 2013(3 years)at 0.5 lots per $10000...unfortunately waste of 3 years

--- 帖子 #326 ---
This is also an example of why you need to trade it on many pairs. Instead of trading 1 pair at .6 lots, trade 6 pairs at .1 lot. its a fact most system will not work in all markets all the time. Again why you need to diversify. While you focused on one pair for 3 years that was flat, many other pairs out performed it during the same period. If you traded all of them you would have ended up with a nice smooth equity curve.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Good Point....can you show/attach the nice smooth equity curve during those 3 years?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
combine the results of the charts on the first post and there you go. 7 currency pairs all including 2011-2013. Non compounding the results are great. Compound them they are even better. Add more pairs to the basket and it gets better.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
There are good results with some pairs, but sometimes, when you use more than 1 max open orders, the system open almost on the same price 2, 3 or 4 orders, so we need that option too in the system - the next open order should be not less than certain pips distance from previous one, depend from the time frame.

EURUSD 30 minutes tf, unusual setup, but since 2012 works great. Anyway 200% profit in three years is very low profit. But if you see the drawndown, it is not big, i think we can use many different charts, each one with the EA with proper setting, in this case we will have good result in terms of percentage and low risk...? By mistake i wrote 30min instead of 1hr. This setting is for EURUSD 1HR TF.

I agree will be interesting to watch the EA trade up again. I was sitting at 20% profit after 3 days now 16% loss. So was a loss of 36% over the weekend and yesterday. I think a trailing SL of 50 pips would help to reduce the damage of the long trending market and I looked at all large winners should not have been effected. Had a few 200 pip losses which we would want to get rid of going forward. Let me know what you think. You can look at my trade explorer to see what I mean. The gambler is the one trading this way since the 10th of this month. I also want to look how many trades of the same pair were running at the same time where I was winning is required so we can drop the number trades down from 5. As when it is a slow trend in the wrong direction it always seems to open the 5 trades which are always loses. I want to test some additional filters as I think we need something to help us.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Been looking looking back at the trades and a trailing SL would have helped allot more then hurt, maybe with a small shift. Just a thought, maybe a high impact news trigger needs to be included so when high impact news is going to happen in the next 30mins and or based on volume growth over a duration the ea shortens the trailing SL to 10 or 20. So we have a fixed trailing SL of 60 which gets shortened and no new trades can be made. I was reading another thread about someone who was implementing the same on his EA, I have asked him some questions on what ended up working.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Abokwaik, just wanted to check up how does the stop loss shift work. If I set it to 0 will it shift based on the original price? It looks like it might be doing something strange, in my tests. I have the trailing SL shift on 0 and the TL on 50.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It doesn't look like the Trailing SL is working. I have set the Trailing SL to 50 pips and the shift to 0. Tried the shift on 1 not much of a difference. You can see this is doing well, until it gets a trade which is trending along which eventually wipes the account because Trailing SL doesn't apply. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at win rate, it is really good. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ignore draw down and profit as the account gets wiped by three trades, two of which should have been closed much earlier by the trailing SL from what I can see. Look at below at trades 101 and 100, these are the two orders that wipe the account. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Can this bug be fixed please?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hello Spencer, I have also noted that trading yesterday , were in positive trading for a while. One idea is to have also used a closure of all operations when you reach a certain level of profit that you take notice . Once they are closed, it is more likely that no longer obtain new conditions RSI and SMA and not re-enter until later . For example, a 2% profit account and all operations would close , they are as they are , making sure that 2% positive in your result. It is clear that there must be stop and trailing stop, but the system can leave the account to zero. Regards.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
It is not clear what feature uses the system (I mean what kind of effect it trades). Because MAs only intersection is not a justification for the system IMHO (but more like a random set of indicators)

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hello fellow traders , I have a question. With any trading system "Just using a trailing stop loss of say 20 pips with a stop loss of 1% make sense ?"

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I have been testing further with the Trailing SL and can't understand what is happening, is there something I am missing? It has some effect but not what I would expect. Have I set something incorrectly below? Here is a screenshot of a set file for back testing: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Below are my settings and date ranges. Attached Image (click to enlarge) These are the results, and if you look at draw down and profit they look bad. But then if you look closer the win ration is 86% which is good. consecutive wins is 20 which is very good consecutive losses is 3 which is also not bad Attached Image (click to enlarge) The below in the graph is can see it is wiped quickly by three trades which I am guessing are the consecutive losses. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Below you can see in the results that it doesn't look like the Trailing SL is applied? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi Spencer, As per your settings your only exit option is the trailing stop. BUT the trailing stop well get activated ONLY if price moves in your favor for the number of pips set in trailing stop, and this does not always happen, so in the last trade price went against you all the way, trailing stop was not activated as price never gone in your favor for 50 points. You need to set at least another one exit option in addition to trailing stop., For example a Stop Loss, or Exit on MA ... etc, Kindly let me know if this is not clear. Regards and Green Pips, Khalil

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks Khalil, make sense now. Sorry I am still learning. Is it possible to set a SL initially and then over ride by Trailing SL going forward if the price rises above purchased price? Or does you EA do this by default if both are set?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Yes, it does. For example : If you set SL tp 100 points, and Trailing Stop to 50 Points. Then if price moves 100 points against you it will be stopped by SL. If price moves 50 points in your favor, SL will be move to Break Even (opening price). Then for each additional 50 points in your favor, SL will be moved by 50 points. You can use also a Trail Stop shift of 5 points to avoid sending too many OrderModify transactions to the broker (they don't like it).

--- 帖子 #353 ---
How about after these events? Did your well trading setup survived?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hello Abokwaik, Again the same problem, 2 trades opened and only 1 closed. Nothing in the logs S

--- 帖子 #355 ---
OK. I will forward test it on fxcm and see.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I haven't tested yet on fxcm, but looking at the code, and in case of multiple orders, and a slow connection/execution, I added a couple of RefreshRates calls in Order Closing and TS. I am testing this version on fxcm today, default settings +3 orders, Close on Slow MA cross. on EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. M15 time frame.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hello! Thanks for EA, I´m testingt it on ICmarket. Can You explain exactly how "Trail Stop Shift" work? Best wishes

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Example : Entry : Buy EURUSD @ 1.11500 , Stop Loss (100 points) @ 1.11400, Trailing Stop (50 points), Trialing Stop Shift (10 points). When price reached 1.11550 (50 points in profit), Stop is moved from 1.11400 to 1.11500 (break even) Then price goes up to 1.11555 SL will not change as the added 5 points is less than Shift which is 10 points Then price goes up to 1.11560 SL is moved to 1.11510, and so on So as price climbs SL will be move in steps of 10 points, compared to the standard shift of 1 point. This way we are reducing OrderModify requests by 10 times, as we are sending an OrderModify request every additional 10 points in our favor.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Elovv, this is to stop constant modifications being done on the Trailing SL from what I understand. Khalil can maybe confirm, but this is how I understand it: So as the price moves up it would normally change every point, this shift means it needs to shift by the number you enter before it changes. So normally if it moved 5 points it would update the SL 5 times, if you have a shift in place of 5 it would only change it once. Update: sorry was typing at the same time as you and got side tracked I see you responded to Elovv already. Can you look at my example below. Thanks Khalil, sorry for the delayed replay on this. Really appreciate your assistance. I just need some clarity on this, does it need to move the full 50 points in my favor before the SL is moved. If I had my shift set to 5 points, I would have thought as soon as I have a gain from the immediate/current price (Not the order price) of 6 points it would then bring the SL up to 50 points below this? So for example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I had no SL's or trailing SL's set in these examples above. I have now set my SL to 200 and my Trailing SL to 50 with a 5 shift. So the price fell from 0.9836 to 0.9822 = 14 points. Would the Trailing SL not now shift the SL (Set it to 50) 50 pips to 0.9872. Update: I understand what happens if the price goes for you from when you ordered, then the SL is moved as it moves and the shift can reduce the changes. If the price goes against you and then comes back for you but not into profit would the Trailing SL be applied?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Trailing Stop get triggered ONLY if price bypasses the Open Price by the Trailing Stop Pips/Points in the trade direction. So the Stop will not move while trade is in loss.

Hi abokwaik, is't possible to make a special MM to this EA? From my BT&amp;forward tests I can see that there is many consequential wins and less consequential losses. maybe we can use antimartingale strategy. it means: If there is win, increase the lotsize by lot increment number. Do it after every win trade until there is a loss. If there is a loss than decrease actual lot size by the lot increment number. For EA it means: external values: Extra MM: YES/NO Lots increment number: 1.1 Thanks for answer..

Hi Khalil, When you get a gap can you take a look at this. I am not sure if the TSL is working as it should. My SL is 200, and my TSL is 50 and the shift is 5. If you look below you will see the TSL definitely worked initially and brought the original SL from 200 to 50 in the green. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But it doesn't look like it has continued to move with the price. It should be 55 behind the price, it is currently sitting at 113points behind. I think it might apply initially and then not continue to follow as it should. Let me know what you think?

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Can't go back much further as some of my pairs I can't seem to get decent tick data, USDCHF my tick data won't come right for some reason not sure if someone can back test this period with my settings. I am also forward testing as per supa's config below but have added in a SL of 200 and a TSL of 50 with a shift of 5. Took a hit last week on my demo accounts when the SL's were not in place. Attached Image Not 100% sure the TSL is working as it should as per above and would be interested to see what difference it makes if it did follow. Could be good or bad... The ones at the top are what I am running in my forward testing but I will be droping some out based on my back tests and how they are performing and replacing them with the ones in the red block. Attached is a spreadsheet and you can see the charts and reports for each of the back tests. Take a look at the back tests and let me know what you think. Spencer

Hey Khalil, Opps. lol, sorry about that. Didn't notice the period was wrong, was confused, hehe. Looks all good now. Still something odd though going on though look at this below. OANDA below, you will see it opened two trades. (This I can see that both RSI's were above 70) Attached Image (click to enlarge) It should have close both trades on the last candle but they are still going? (This is an issue) Not sure why they didn't close? Then this is Hotforex, you will see with the same settings it only opened one trade, look below. (This is because on Hotforex the one RSI was below 70, differs from OANDA) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This was closed correctly. Then this is Roboforex, which looks like is the same as Hotforex. (So the RSI was not above 70 making the second trade not valid) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This was also closed correctly. If you look there are lots of open trades that Roboforex has open that both OANDA and Hotforex hasn't, eish. There doesn't seem to be constancy, not sure if it is possibly the computers battling causing it but I doubt it. Below are is some detail not sure if it will help on the trades not closing. Hotforex trades were closed. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Roboforex Trades not being closed and still running now? Attached Image (click to enlarge) All five of these should have been closed?

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not sure if this might be what is causing the differences between the platforms. Doesn't look like the other platforms email me when these events happen.

Hi A bokwaik , is't possible to make a rule in EA for minimum distance between trades? I think it could help to better DD. I thing somebody wrote the same request in forum. Sometime EA open trades really very close to each other and this situation increase risk without any help for taking profit. Thanks

Hi, you could look at the "journal" in mt4 to find out the order price during that time to better determine the issue.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
yes i understood that but it might be dangerous in case of 1 way direction without pullback. Had you read my post about a filter regarding the distance betwwen 200MA and price? If price is too far from 200 MA, the probability of a pullbacl in direction of the 200MA is high so we don't enter trade in the direction of the 200MA. S

Yes, it's on my list. I will continue this in the Elite thread.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I agree. This is why I added 2 additional exit options, SL &amp; Trailing stop, AND, cross of Slow EMA. Yes. I did. It makes sense. However "too far" is vague.

Thanks, sorry but what is Elite thread?;-)

Elite : automation of selected systems

--- 帖子 #418 ---
OK, great. Thanks. Should I write the change request to Elite thread once again?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Maybe the answer is in the elite trade. Thank you. It could be a very good system if we could filter these big trending trades....

Hi, was selecting Exit on Cross for "Exit for Fast MA". any reason it didn't close when cross fast MA?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
no one interested on this anymore?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I will go live when the minimum distance feature between 2MA will be added.

it has been mobed in another thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...59#post8784459

Hi There, Question. Is there a system that uses the previous days high and low as the indicator to place 2 trades ?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Great thread Sis. Some great logic going on in here. Totally agree with your thoughts on diversification and I like the robust nature of your system. :-)

--- 帖子 #363 ---
May I know where to get template for your strategy...?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
So in this case, there's no SL nor TP. But is "exit" condition, just close the position whenever price crosses the fast EMA. Isn't it ? *I'm trying to figure out what SL is used in this system.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Yes. This is one of the options available in the EA. Other options including Hard Stop are also available. The EA was provided for testing different options.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I have no idea of what the settings do! I am trying to figure out the best settings for M15 to M30.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hello Don't waste your time. best settings is on 1h S

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hey! Anybody still trading this system with success? Would be nice to see some forward testing.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Namaste! I am looking for a viable EA that is a trend following EA. I've tested this EA with defe's setings on different pairs and it gave me only good results. I will try to put it on a demo on a vps. All the best!

Hi I used this strategy as a test for my new EA, fxRulesEngine, software (for MT4) as part of final testing for release. The software processes rules and instructions in a text file enabling non-programmers to back test or forward test (and run live) plans like this. My version tested as profitable ($10,000 demo account) on the EURUSD from Jan to Oct 2016 but with only a few signals (results attached). For the record my rules were configured for daily trades: Â Buy when price above SMA(200); below SMA(5); and below 5 for RSI(2) Sell when price below SMA(200); above SMA(5); and above 5 for RSI(2) Close Buy order when price crosses above SMA(5) Close Sell order when price crosses below SMA(5) Otherwise rely on stop loss or take profit settings for closing Calculate stop loss and take profit settings on daily ATR(14) Calculate lot size on risk management settings (by default 1%) Trail stops from break-even using ATR(14) calculations So it looks a profitable, although, conservative trading plan. A trader may be able to safely increase the risk% to 5% with little draw down. Obviously more testing would be needed. Â Thanks Alex

HI, are you using this EA. I just came across it. I put it onto the backetester, but nothing moved!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi, Is anyone still working on this? I have been testing the exit strategy for this system and have been getting good results. I was wondering if anyone was keen to throw some ideas around.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I have made my own test … Based of original Sis.yphus rules using only close of candles as levels of opening and closing positions, spread and gaps included to testing, no swap calculated… 15 pairs: ADUJPY, AUDNZD, AUDUSD, CADJPY, CHFJPY, EURCHF, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY Daily time frame Multiply entries - max 3 per pair Basic capital of 10000 USD Simulation for 0,1 L position Simulation for 0,3 L position Simulation for 0,3 L position and increasing/decreasing position by 0,01 L every 1000 USD of increase or decrease of equity Time: 01.01.2013 to 31.12.2017 … five years Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

G'day Khalil Abokwaik First of all thanking you for such a wonderful work, I have been forward testing TWOMA ONE RSI EA. It is observed that the second simultaneous trade is a loss in most of the time , How can the second order can be restricted? for example a SELL trade, RSI was above 70 line during first SELL trade, then it crosses below 70 line, the first trade closes in profit, after few bars RSI return back and crosses above the 70 line creates another SELL trade and in most cases the trade is big loss. is there any chance, can we restrict second immediate same direction trade if not RSI move to oversold area(crosses below 30 line) and return back? thanks Attached Image
