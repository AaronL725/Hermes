friends.. I am interested in sharing a method..that has been inspired by the millipede thread started by pipeasy ..i have also modified some of the indicators and templates used in the flying buddha technique..again, explained very well by pipeasy. I think this WILL be MASSIVELY profitable system in the long run(with occasional bouts of successive losses)... but, so far in a very short period of time, its exceeded my expectations!! The key to this method is patience and sticking to the rules. EDITED JUNE 2013: THE UPDATED SYSTEM USES WEEKLY CHART FOR TREND DETERMINATION AND 15 MIN FOR ENTRIES AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVIOUS IDEA/METHOD OF DAILY AND 5MIN (THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS UPDATED SYSTEM, AS I SEE IT.. CONTROLLED LOSSES, LOW MAINTENANCE AND THE PRESENCE OF "NO TRADE" PERIODS) Its still in the testing &amp; improvement phase I am still demoing..so please do not put any real money.. which in no way..will i be responsible for your losses!! SET UP: USE 2 CHARTS FOR EVERY PAIR: A. 15 MINUTE CHART (3/5 EMA CROSS- ENTRIES CHART)= USE KOLIER EA B. WEEKLY CHART (2/5 EMA CROSS-TREND INDICATOR CHART)= USE BREAK EVEN V2 EA RULES: 1. TURN ON THE KOLIER EA, IN THE DIRECTION SUGGESTED BY THE WEEKLY CHART ARROW (SAFE ENTRY: START FROM THE NEXT WEEKLY CANDLE ) 2. STAY IN THE MARKET TILL A NEW ARROW SUGGESTS OTHERWISE ( EXIT: ON THE NEXT WEEKLY CANDLE) 3. PAUSE TRADING ON THE 15 MIN CHART ONCE YOU SEE OPPOSITE ARROW BEING FORMED 4. USE A SL OF +/-70 FOR EURNZD, GBPNZD ETC. 5. USE A SL OF +/- 30 FOR EURJPY, GBPJPY ETC. 6. WATCH YOUR TRADES ONCE EVERY DAY OR EVERYOTHER DAY 7. IF YOUR BALANCE IS IN NEGATIVE, CLOSE A FEW OF THE WELL FORMED LEGS TO REPLENISH THE ACCOUNT. 8. START BELIEVING IN THE FACT THAT ENTRIES ARE RANDOM AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT (WHICH MEANS, THERE COULD BE A STRING OF LOSSES ) TRADE MANAGEMENT: 1. ENTER (AUTOMATED) 2 LOTS (MICRO/MINI/STANDARD) 2. EXIT ONE LOT (AUTOMATED) WHEN TP=SL, AND LET THE OTHER LOT(NOW, THIS SL IS MOVED TO ENTRY PRICE) RUN TO THE MOON. 3. DO NOT ENTER OR EXIT ON THE WEEKLY CANDLE AS THE ARROW IS BEING FORMED (ALWAYS ENTER ON THE FOLLOWING CANDLE) 4. EXIT(MANUALLY) WHEN THE WEEKLY TREND IS DEAD SET FILE FOR KOLIER EA: AdvisorName=Kolier_MA_Crossover_EA AdvisorVersion=1.0.2 ProjectPage=http://kolier.li/project/kolier-ma-crossover-ea Entry_Exit=Entry &amp; Exit Settings TradeAtBarOpen=0 AllowBuyAmount=400 AllowSellAmount=400 AllowHedge=0 CloseOpposite=0 MAFast_iMA=http://kolier.li/example/mt4-ima-system-moving-average MAFast_Period=3 MAFast_Shift=0 MAFast_Method=1 MAFast_Price=0 MASlow_iMA=http://kolier.li/example/mt4-ima-system-moving-average MASlow_Period=5 MASlow_Shift=0 MASlow_Method=1 MASlow_Price=0 Trade_Time_Filter=http://kolier.li/example/script-function-trade-time-filter TradeTimeFilter=0 TradeBegin=07:00 TradeEnd=19:00 EndInTomorrow=0 Order_Operation_Open=http://kolier.li/example/script-function-order-operation-open ECNBroker=0 Magic=222222 Slippage=10 Lots=0.10000000 StealthMode=0 TakeProfit=0.00000000 StopLoss=50.00000000 Order_Operation_BreakEven=http://kolier.li/example/script-function-order-operation-breakeven UseBreakEven=0 BE_StealthMode=0 BreakEvenPips=20.00000000 BreakEvenWithProfit=0 BreakEvenProfit=3.00000000 Order_Operation_Trailing_Stop=http://kolier.li/example/script-function-order-operation-trailing-stop UseTrailStop=0 TrailAfterEven=0 TS_StealthMode=0 TrailStopPips=20.00000000 TS_MovingInChunk=0 TS_Chunk=10.00000000 SET FILE FOR BREAKEVEN EA: LockInPipsAt=70 LockInPips=0 Trades=2 ModifyTrades=1 ModifyTrade3=0 FontSize=10 FontColour=16776960 PLEASE NOTE: MA ribbon goes in the experts/indicator folder...kolier and breakeven goes to experts folder; and weekly and 15 min goes to template folder

--- 帖子 #2 ---
this is the floating pips/profit in 3 weeks.. i know it fluctuates..but just to show you the power of letting your winners run!!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
ENTRY: check the signal on the daily chart which is using the MA ribbon signals. its a simple 3/20 ema cross signal. go to the 5 min chart. 1. enter on the cross of 9/20 ema cross with the MA ribbon signals. 2. enter only on the second consecutive signal which is somewhat of a confirmation that the trend is established in the direction of the main daily trend 3. keep stacking positions. 4. establish SL as the peaks or valleys associated with the eMA cross. TRADE MANAGEMENT and EXIT: I enter with 2 units (micro/mini/standard..whatever) 1. exit first unit when the lows or highs of the daily candles are violated depending if its uptrend or downtrend 2.exit the second unit when when there is a signal change in the daily chart..i.e. 3/20 ema cross.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
2 TEMPLATES.. one for daily chart for trend determination second, for entries on 5 min chart

--- 帖子 #5 ---
you will have numerous small losses..learn to love it. there is no way around it.. think about it.. the entries are 50/50..nobody knows what the hell this animal would do in the next second. but, the advantage we have on our side is that.. forex markets maintain the trends for weeks and months.. we need to capitalize on it,, by keeping our positions open to maximize the gains.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I have 75% of losing trades..something like around 40 losing trades. But, MY LOSSES ARE SO SMALL.. that i know i can stay here in this business for much longer.. if you see..the majority of my pips movement was from gbpjpy..which always moves like a psycho-monster.. I like it!! so the big gains eclipsed all my small losses+ my partial exits (closing 1 unit) kind of filled in the gaps to make the equity line look nice.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
the advantage of using 2 unit entries.. you will have a 1 unit exit using high/low violation of the daily candles and then the final exit..where you exit every open position!! please look at the systematic way in which i exit from the charts attached. this is a simple method(read: not easy)..all you have to do is just follow the rules..and get your hands on those elusive pips.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
some of the entries I took yesterday... on the 5 min chart (after determining the trend in daily chart)

--- 帖子 #9 ---
all the entries are taken from 5 min chart with a SL.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
if these positions survive for the long run!!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
before i come back to see if there are any opportunities.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
audusd and eurusd entries were losses.. the price came back to hit the SL.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Supercat, Am following this with great interest but have a small question. the daily trend at moment on gbp/jpy is down as per your rules, but last couple of days have been up candles, should we still take short signals on 5min chart or should we wait for daily to start going down again. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Geoff: you are right!! we are only in sell on gbpjpy.. you could actually wait...yes, when the daily candle is red that is a good indication..but also.. you could see from the 5 min chart (of course you get your judgement from the daily candle really well)... but, you dont take every signals.. you take the second signal onwards in the downtrend..i have marked them in the attachment...all losses..thats ok..its part of the game. with some practise... most times just visually...you will get a feel for it.. and again..like i said..entries have only 50/50 chance to survive.. if you see my losses.. i have plenty and i will have plenty.. but the daily chart should give you the confidence in staying in the trend.. and stacking (pyramiding).. ask me any questions..i would love to explain about this method.. i will truly go above and beyond in helping you or any person who would 'want to join me in this journey. thanks, manny Hi Supercat, Am following this with great interest but have a small question. the daily trend at moment on gbp/jpy is down as per your rules, but last couple of days have been up candles, should we still take short signals on 5min chart or should we wait for daily to start going down again. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #15 ---
eurjpy..nothing really!!..because we are looking for sell signals.. it just seems to be going up. eurnzd...i am waiting based on the daily candle and waiting for the second signal. gbpchf..1 loss..but, i am waiting for it start a downtrend. all these are 5 min charts!!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
few signals being generated here..on GBPNZD Note: if you look at the daily on this pair..based on the moving average cross there seems to be plenty of sell momentum..meaning it seems like a strong downtrend so far.. again, its something i see as a possibility only..as, i have no powers of prediction!!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
no problem.. I am still up by 4800+ pips.. I would be happy even if its just 2323 pips in realized gains at the end of the month..thats 20% !! although..i will still be happy with whatever the market and the trends give me...meaning.. i would love for the trend to go to the moon!!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Loving your thread, and also your open trades ill definitely follow you and subscribed! way to go buddy.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
thanks my friend... lets go loot those pips..keep the platform running!!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
i felt like posting this..because i did not have anything else to post.. still waiting!!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Its boring..but...i simply cannot believe myself.. that i have developed the patience.. I used to have the trigger fingers for many years.. also, that stems from lack of confidence.. anybody can learn technical analysis in 60 days.. but, to learn to trade it takes years...believe me!! and I know..i have a long way to go myself..in terms of my goals. thanks, manny p.s: I strongly recommend "trend following" by Micheal CoVel.. it changed the way i saw trading forever!!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
clear signal on the 5min chart

--- 帖子 #23 ---
this should be a good one..because you can keep the SL very small..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Mann I took sell on eur/usd as well , also aud/usd and gbp/usd. Lets see what happens, Geoff

--- 帖子 #25 ---
the daily candle seems to be in a strong downtrend.. I need that one entry so i could get in that freight train..

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Geoff my friend.. perfect man..you saw the signals you went for it.. same here.. just mechanical.. thats all i am doing..loss or gain..doesnt matter.. all it matters is let us follow the rules..and expect the equity to build in the long run. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Quick loss on aud/usd

--- 帖子 #28 ---
there was a spike in audusd in a minute...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
its almost going to break the uptrend/.. i am waiting for the signals...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Manny How many pairs do you watch and how many new trades do you take in relation to your m/m. Midnight here in UK so neally time for my bed but will be picking this up again tommorow. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Geoff: pairs i watch.. audusd eurusd eurjpy gbpjpy gbpchf eurnzd gbpnzd some have very high correlation..but thats ok.. i just want it trending and lively movements.. I know the last 2 pairs have outrageous spreads ..but.. they move like crazy and they dont range too much on the daily chart.. (the latter is very important to me!!) I hate usdcad because of the spikes...and i never play w/o sl. you could experiment with other pairs that are much safer.. thanks

--- 帖子 #32 ---
the way I see money management is I dont want my drawdown to be more than -10% for this system... at any given time. so essentially, the volatile pairs eurnzd and gbpnzd...very few orders.. most of my orders are gbpjpy, eurjpy and gbpchf eurusd and udusd..the stop losses are genrally small anyways.. so simply put..i would not want to risk no more than 1% on a NORMAL trade.. but it always will be less than that.. ideally, 0.5-0.8%... and now, when I close the first lot/unit..I would have made up for a string of these little losses. this is my money and trade management.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
waiting with patience..

--- 帖子 #34 ---
how is ur gbpusd doing? seems like the eurusd has weathered that momentary uptrend?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi supercat, I'm using a similar approach but using lines of support and resistance so that I can enter on a high/low. Also I move SL to BE once the trade goes my way.... try to wait until new short term resistance is established, this way I no longer have to worry about MM for that trade. Off to work now - it's only morning here in West Australia, but I'll be interested to check your thread later this evening. Looking forward to following your thread and getting some more tips. Can you explain your signal a little more.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Carlito, I see your point..about using s&amp;r.. ....I am still experimenting..because of the small stop loss but, I agree..the equity curve will be much smoother if I adopted BE. my signals: on the 5 min..i just use 9/20 ema cross as the signal.. and i enter on the second signal when the trend is established.. and then i start to scale in. my main intention is to pyramid the positions. on the daily its a 3/20 ema cross signal for the main direction. just very simple method

--- 帖子 #37 ---
post #4 has my system.. with templates and the relevant indicators... see if it works..it should also have the alerts set up in the templates. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #38 ---
it looks like an ok signal to me

--- 帖子 #39 ---
strong downtrend,,,look at the daily. I just want to get in!!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
but, i am waiting for the second signal..

--- 帖子 #41 ---
fx morgue!!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
so did you get in?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
everything is just dead.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
lets see... finally GOT IN!! LOL

--- 帖子 #45 ---
there might be "all exit" on the daily charts for audusd, eurusd, gbpjpy, eurjpy.. seems like a trend change.. i am patiently waiting for the signal change so..i can exit the 2nd unit!! OR..maybe it could be just a strong retracement..who knows?? i will be looking at oppurtunities to start stacking on eurnzd and gbpnzd.. seems like they have a strong downward momentum on the daily by the way the MA crosses have occurred.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Supercat, Your method does work with the TF 4H period ? As I work, I can not use the period 15 min. Sorry for my english. Mike PS : great tread

--- 帖子 #47 ---
UNFORTUNATELY.. you will have very few entries(but they are accurate ones)... and the chances for scaling in are few or sometimes none.. you could try entering on 1 hr and use daily chart as the trend base chart or.. try entering on 4hr and use the weekly chart for trend analysis...you would do a killing..you will have a mountain of pips when you consider the complete exits during a trend change.. again..its not easy..because you are leaving the orders open for months and sometimes a year or 2.. that one trend will make you pips like crazy!!! again..if that suits you..you should go for it.. there are a 1000 ways to trade..find the one that fits your profile. thanks for joining in..

--- 帖子 #48 ---
actually, Mike.. I think, I would like to try and forward test a working man's weekly trend trading with 4 hr entries (high sl..but thats ok..because the entries are fewer) let me try and see the potential on a few pairs.. i will keep you posted on the results/backtests etc. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I already have 2 positions.. in the running ..lets see.. how it goes.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Nice thread. I've also been trading Graeme's style for a while now and its absolutely the best way to trade in my opinion. I'm subscribed, I look forward to hearing more about your entry method.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I think Graeme has inspired a lot of traders here.. and I agree with you.. the power of scaling in and letting the profits run.. is the best method in trading. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #53 ---
could possibly..be exiting all sell positions.. on audusd.. i am waiting.. because the candle crossed the MA.. i AM JUST WAITING FOR THE ARROW TO APPEAR!!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
look at the strength on the downtrend in the daily chart.. seems like its the beginning of the freight train's departure!!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
a downtrend on the daily... and seems like the sellers are pushing the candle down wards(although..it hasn't closed yet!!) anyways..i am waiting for a signal to enter.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
just now...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
showing my sell entries i am scalin in..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi Mann With you on all those entrys, although I work during the day so can only trade of an evening. Geoff

--- 帖子 #59 ---
maybe you could try just trading the latter half of NY and some of the Tokyo session...although these seem REALLY slow..you will always have entries.. just follow the rules..rinse and repeat.. take the losses and try to be mechanical..the wins will come!! its difficult..but, i just try not to analyze my losses..because i followed the rules.. or as i explained in one of the earlier posts.. you could try entering on the 4hr charts and watch the trend on the weekly.. its very long term..but there is a lot of pips because of the FX trends.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks Manny Will carry on as I am and see what happens, quite a few trades trades do pop up during later part of US session. Geoff

--- 帖子 #61 ---
seems like a trend change.. i am waiting.. if i get the signal for trend change on daily.. i will close all the positions in a heart beat..even if i made just 100 pips..

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Manny Do you wait for daily candle to close on trend change or just cross of ma"s. Geoff

--- 帖子 #63 ---
also..I'm thankful for everybody's support here..so far.. I want to see the potential in this system.. I am confident this is going to kick ass!! and I think this is probably one of the simplest systems/methods you could find here..(of course vegas and cornflower are excellent uncomplicated too) just a simple MA crossover system on multiple time frames..THATS IT.. the signals are basically showing us momentum to enter on peaks and valleys.. we observe the daily candles..to see the open and close(S&amp;R) and the strength of the momentum and also for exits.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Got to love this..gbpnzd..the trend is so strong.. even the stray bullets will hit the bulls eye..10/10

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I think I will wait for the candle close on the daily for a trend change.. see..again ....if you want to be aggressive..when the daily candle touches the red EMA...(because its an indication that the trend is weakened) you could close maybe 25% or 50% of your lot sizes to bank some profits.. and if the trend resumes(maybe if it was just a strong retracement)..then you still have the rest... running with the trend and then keep on stacking. Thanks, Manny Manny Do you wait for daily candle to close on trend change or just cross of ma"s. Geoff

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Diversify.. ..now since I am awaiting trend change on a few of them..the pips are drying up..but... i can clearly concentrate on the "hot" pairs that are trending.. so..it helps to maintain a nice equity.. ALSO..NOTE THAT I HAVE OVER 50 LOSING TRADES.. like I said..make your losses very small..the wins will take care of everything.. don't worry even if at the end of the day..if you are JUST break even.. your judgement in the market and taking trades, would have increased than what us from the previous day..

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I had 1 position that i closed for 90 some pips.. Now, I want to start hunting for buys..

--- 帖子 #68 ---
waiting for first lot exits on eurnzd and gbpnzd.. if it remains today's candle remains a doji...before the high is violated.. then we would have made quite a bit of pips.. waiting for full exits on the rest of the pairs except gbpchf. seems like the beginning of a trend change waiting for long entries on audusd.. now, its somewhat in a range.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
just to show you what i was talking about in my previous email

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I am exiting 50% of the second lot for the following pairs.. 1. eurjpy 2. eurusd because the daily candles have touched the red ema. look at the charts. sheeeez!!..i accidentally closed one full lot of the eurjpy.. @ Geoff... this is exit, what I had mentioned to you in your previous email.. thanks for that question, I appreciate it. I learnt a lot about exits and trade management from MAX trading system..although, I never found success with it.. they have some excellent steroid like super-aggressive pip making strategies.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
that i initially posted this system in pipeasy's millipede thread and I was no appreciated or at least some did not like my method, or my forex rambling.. i deleted all my posts there...and i am here now.. i am like "f...watch me!!".. because I want to give back what i learnt.. even if i have to fight like GSP.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
closed out 50% of lot sizes of all the gbpjpy positions because the daily candle touched the red ema. note that this is an aggressive exit.. because the trend change signal hasn't appeared.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
To protect the pips.. seems like I am letting too much of pips vanish off my table during the trend change.. since i use 20 ema.. i think, i will have to go with 10 ema crossing 3 ema.. this would lead to more trend changes.. nd i might chopped to death during ranges..but, lets see.. i will be backtesting it over a range of currencies this weekend to see the potential.. also, i am also thinking of using 15 minutes for entries because, 5 mins is taking away all my time i still think that the emas used on the 5min chart is fine as is..

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Supercat, Trader "Joe" from Flying Buddha fame is documented as exiting 50% of his short positions when a long candle closed above the open of the most recent short candle. Then, Joe just kept "stacking" as the opportunities developed unless he experienced a second consecutive opposing candle. Just an observation, Jon

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I think you are reacting too quickly to a minor downturn in your profitability. Your timing was very good in regards to the daily chart and you were adding in positions on 5min while the trend was still being established. These positions turned quickly profitable and you were pleased with the results. Now that the momentum has slowed and you are taking a few more losses than you were previously. This is normal and you can't predict when momentum will slow...however...once you start experiencing back to back losses, its time to stop adding positions and wait for market to consolidate and leave your open positions at B/E. In summary I would say just stick with your current strategy and I'm sure you will find results. I personally use a 5 and 10 EMA like Graeme does and I find it works for me just like 9 and 20 EMA may work for you. One could use 7 and 15 EMAs and I'm sure it could work. One other note I don't like your exit method of getting out when it touches the 20 EMA, seems a bit wasteful and doesn't focus enough on the actual price action, but again just my opinion and if you can make it work then more power to you.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I shorted EURNZD and EURUSD last night. +120 total pips this morning. I didn't enter on the 5s like you suggested. Instead on the gap. In either case, sail with the pervailing daily trade winds, which in this case was sell. According to your system, once we established a position, do we only stack; that is, add to the position with every two crosses? We initially enter on the M5 after two 9 ema / 20 ema crosses. Do you just enter at each individual cross after that, or every other cross?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thanks for your support and the analysis.. I always welcome ideas and thoughts.. I think you are right..I should be considering putting everything to BE which is also what Graeme emphasizes on. Yes..I see your point, on second thought..I think exiting on 20 ema touch is pointless because..what if the trend travels another 1000 pips..right? maybe..just a partial exit..I have to look into that. Thanks Zusch for your input.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
The Brigadier.. Yes, I try to enter after the second cross of 9/20 ..maybe 2 to 3 positions, at least...on every cross as long as they are not very close to each other and visually they are in a clear downtrend or uptrend.. this is at your discretion. How many positions you want to add.. depends..if you would like to put these positions to BE as you enter into the next position..then you can add unlimited number of positions because all the previous positions are essentially free because its at BE. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks my friend.. I have been impressed by the method while ago.. yes, that is one of my options that i think i should be looking into.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
with a profit of 2000+pips.. I hate to do this..closing everything abruptly, against my rules.. but, I am travelling for some time in places where the internet is unheard of...lol will be back for the Tiger trading. P.S: i just feel that 5/10 ema on the 15m chart works super!!..for entries. I will have to do some back test on that.. 9/20 works fine as is..just that the number of signals are more on 5/10..

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I like the thread and I don't want to get in the way with a lot of my posts so I shall just do one big one now and I can reduce it or delete it as the OP wishes. In my thread "Swing trading with Heiken Ashi and Stochs" I have been slowly moving towards longer and longer timeframes and reading various threads such as this about longer term position building has got me thinking. I love the idea of taking entries on the 5 min chart but I'm not sure why you are so happy to lose so many of your initial entries? I'm sure these could be refined and a more aggressive policy of moving to break even after a small number of pips may improve your overall win/loss ratio. In terms of an entry system and a method for determing the overall trend I can't think of anything better than using heiken ashi with stochastics and 1 or 2 moving averages. I would say that because it is my system but I honestly think this is the best method. The beauty of it is that it works in any timeframe. The idea that this and a few other threads has given me is to start with the weekly chart, wait for a signal. The pair must give a positive or more or less neutral swap in the direction you intend to trade. Once you have determined the weekly trend you watch the daily for a pullback. Once the daily has turned in the direction of the weekly then you wait for a pullback on the hourly. Once you have a pullback on the hourly then you trade the first pullback on the 5 min chart and keep attempting to enter until you either have a trade in profit or the hourly/daily signal invalidates itself. For entries on the 5 min I recommend using the HA and stoch cross but also using a 25 pip round number grid as quite often the best trades involve a bounce from one of these levels. A 15 pip stop is usually enough and I would get to break even after 10 or 15 pips. If the trade survives then you have an open trade in the direction of the weekly trend. I would add on at every hourly pullback and attempt to get two or three trades to break even and hold them. I would never close partial lots, I would only ever close all the trades together and to do that I would either trail behind the 10 ema on the weekly chart or close on a heiken ashi change on the weekly chart. The above amounts to a similar but quite different system and I may or may not open a seperate thread. Sorry to the OP if this messes up your thread, I will remove it if you wish. Good luck to all.

I appreciate it that you share your trade，as for me,I learn so much from your words, Thanks, I am From CHINA and born in 1990.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
some analysis... i did some backtesting and change in strategies.. because some of the responses..were thought provoking here.. made me look a little bit deeper into back testing and some sensitivity analysis.. after all everything in life is..OPTIMIZATION.. anyways.. as for the chart..instead of using the 9/20 ema.. i am going with 5/10 ema cross..for the smaller time frame (better entries) and the daily chart (a balanced exit).. did some back testing which i will share with you.. and i will address the adjusted trade management based on my backtesting and what i see would actually reduce the losses.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
i will be using for the daily---5/10 ema cross to determine the trend for entries..i am using..5/10 as well, because it seems better in terms of stop loss distance and no. of entries. instead of using the 5 min..i am using the 15 min..because..seems like i am getting the ALMOST same number of positions in the long run.. hence its less fluctuations (less traumatic to the eyes) and less no. of losses compared to 5 min...again..its your choice. Please note I said..ALMOST..it could vary greatly on any day on any currency pair

--- 帖子 #85 ---
here is what I think is ..my alteration.. I am going to enter with 2 lots like i am always used to.. but, I want to close 1 lot as soon as the price makes a profit that is equal to the stop loss..this will reduce my losses greatly..and in a trend when you are adding positions..a take profit of 50 pips..is a piece of cake on 15 min charts.. because you are still in the trend and your SL is the high or low, depending on the trend..meaning, price always respects the high and low in a trend.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I did this while I was on the move..manually.. on a 15 min chart for audusd.. ...for the trend period of 5/02 to 6/06 results: SCENARIO 1:- without breakeven and applying the new trade management rules. entering on 5/10 cross like always on 15 min. 13 positions-4190 pips 10 losses-2 lots-10x100= minus 1000 pips (lets assume a SL of 50 pipsx2 =100 pips (worst case scenario..audusd generally would be around 20 pips..if that on a 15 mins..whatever) now, net = 3190 pips.. SCENARIO 2:- with breakeven and entering on 5/10 cross like always on 15 min 3 positions-1600 pips 10 losses-1 lots-10x50= minus 500 pips (lets assume a SL of 50 pips (worst case scenario..audusd generally would be around 20 pips..if that on a 15 mins..whatever!!) now, net = 1100 pips..

audusd.. results: SCENARIO 1a:- without breakeven and applying the new trade management rules. entering on 5/10 cross like always on 15 min. 5 positions-800 pips 7 losses-2 lots-7x100= minus 700 pips (lets assume a SL of 50 pipsx2 =100 pips (worst case scenario..audusd generally would be around 20 pips..if that on a 15 mins..whatever) so, net (floating) is 100 pips.. and this is JUST the beginning of the upmove you have to wait till it forms a nice trend to see a healthy P/L....... and believe me the losses will be of lesser magnitude because 50 pips per SL is too much, really.

good luck with your pip hunt

that the backtest is for a shot period of time and markets are random..any testing is not to be taken as absolute for any pair or for any period of time ..its just confidence building. My main thing is that I need to stack my positions and I want them to stay alive.. breakeven means they die more often than staying alive..because the price always comes back to retest the valleys and peaks.. A SL ABOVE/BELOW these peaks and valleys are mostly honoured rather than a random point in a chart. because if 2 of these positions survive to be 1000 pippers.. tht should cover all of my losses in the few pairs that I am playing.. and everything else is mine. BUT..not having breakeven means..you will eat more losses.. it could eclipse your profits...meaning all your hard work will go to nothing. so, I came up with the 2 lot entries.. and closing 1 lot when it gets into a small profit.. so, essentially its a free trade...and since its a trend..you could stack up and the take profit will be reached consecutively till the trend bends,,,you can see that by visually inspecting your 15 min charts.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
You know, after you are stopped out at break even that's not the end of the story. You can always reenter when it starts going in the trend direction again. All it means is that you pay less in losses but still get the same amount of winning trades.

Hugh: I greatly appreciate your thoughts and strategies.. I welcome you here, please post anytime..and lets make this discussion lively. I am answering some of the topics that you have asked me.. you really made me take a very closer look at some of the minor flaws in this system.. Also, I never really look at a system with win/loss ratio.. ..I see markets as perfectly random with no common sense except the daily and monthly trends in FX markets, and to me any random blind man's entry can succeed to make you those profits. I think your system is great, esp. following the weekly for exits...i am sure you will be making a killing when you exit..with all the accumulated profits. HA does mke it easier to follow the trends..its like a big brother.. i did some testing with HA on the firebird semi automatic system(here in FF)..its visually very helpful!! about the breakeven or not?..i have addressed in the above threads.. which i think should work for me. again. thanks for bringing this up.. I will have to do further backtesting on other pairs..to validate with a high degree of statistical confidence. please feel free to share you views here. Thanks, Manny

I enter on the second 5/10 ema cross.. so, I would have lost a position from the previous downtrend and now, i cannot enter at the peak of this new downtrend because i wait for the second signal to enter.. i will post chart which might be better

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thanks Manny, I love the thread and your ideas. I am now considering just trading using heiken ashi candles on monthly charts. When the monthly ha candle closes I will establish 2 or 3 trades in the same direction and hold them until the monthly trend changes. Something I have been using to try and aid with this is where the price closes in relation to a 12 sma. The price can continue to close one side of this sma for a long period of time, all the time you are collecting swap and profits. I haven't completely finalised my plan yet but thanks for starting this thread and giving me some ideas for how to improve my own trading.

Entries on 15 min chart from the second 5/10 ema cross onwards.. THIS IS THE NEW TRADE MANGEMENT THAT I AM FOLLOWING.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
this was a nice entry on the second 5/10 ema cross.. and as you can see the downtrend is strong..you could see you would have gotten 1 lot take profit easily.. and then let the second lot run...as part of position building

--- 帖子 #96 ---
1st lot closed with a take profit=sl; second lot open..and still running

Hi, Firstly, congratulation for your work ! Secondly, I haven't a cross and a green arrow on chart of GBP/JPY on Daily whereas I have the same template than you. Can you explain me why please ? Thanks a lot !!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
double click on the ma ribbon it will open the indicator properties... and change the first ma period to 5 and the second ma period to 10 on both the charts...daily and 15 min now, you will see everything that i see.. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks a lot !! A last question please, why don't I have the same number of candles after the cross ? Thanks again man ;-)

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I am not sure about the no. of candles.. but, I think, the candle type depends on the broker timings.. so, your doji might be not be a doji for me.. because your close and open will differ from mine. please correct me if i am wrong. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yes, It's a possibility. I will try your broker in order to see that. Thanks, King regards !

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hugh: Perfect.. following a monthly trend means you are the elite few among the traders.. it also, means you will have a life outside of forex...and solid long term profits. i hope you grand success in your venture.. i think, the only thing i would be careful is the negative swap.. it could eat up some of your profits.. but, the flip side is, if you are long on any of the jpy pairs(mostly commodity with jpy) or any pairs that earn swap, and since the trends seems to last for a long period... you will earn swaps+pips... adding the element of carry trading..I would love to try that someday. its a very good idea to let the trend do the hard work... also, since you would like to keep 2-3 positions alive, have you looked into exotics? you are always welcome here for discussions thanks, manny

What has produced better results for you thus far: closing half the trade when price has reached profit equal to stoploss as outlined in post #85 or waiting for the daily to pierce the MA as in post #112?

I tested on going with 2 lots only...(meaning 1st lot, sl=tp, 2nd lot w/o a tp..meaning a runner) and just for FUN, i tested on ALL the signals, meaning i took all sell signals or buy signals in accordance with the daily trend here is what i got. NOW..PLEASE NOTE THAT I TESTED WITH A MORE SENSITIVE EMA COMBINATION 3/5 FOR 15 min ENTRIES...AND 3/5 FOR DAILY.. THE RESULTS ARE F AWESOME.. THIS IS FOR THE PERIOD FROM BEGINNING OF MAY OR SO WHEN THE STRONG DOWN TREND OCCURRED on the daily charts.. GBPUSD Downtrend: - 1000+3500= +2500 pips Uptrend:- - 400+140= - 260 pips EURNZD Downtrend: - 2164+10760= +8596 pips Uptrend:- - 962+1100= - 138 pips AUDUSD Downtrend: - 1422+8390= +6968 pips Uptrend:- - 1078+1400= +322 pips AUDJPY Downtrend: - 1200+3660= +2460 pips Uptrend:- (- 300+50) + (- 90+50)= - 290 pips EURJPY Downtrend: Uptrend:- (- 240+370) + (- 440+320) +(- 90+130) +(- 800+1040) = +290 pips

would love to add a stop loss based on the high or low of the entry candle depending on the trend (and maybe with a provision to add a buffer of 2-5 pips) when entering on the candle after a ma cross. entering with 2 lots; for the first lot the sl=tp and second lot tp=0. i want to test this on the strategy tester... if anyone would be willing to add this to the following ea..i would greatly appreciate the help. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Has your method, in this testing, changed in any other significant way than the 3/5 EMAs, or is it still the same as in the first couple of posts?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
in my method, i am scaling in (entering) at every second signal (and onwards) in the direction of the trend, which means.. i would not be able to stack as many positions as in the testing.. BUT..I WOULD NOT HAVE AS MANY LOSSES AS SHOWN IN THE TESTING AS WELL now..looking only at the losses part(forget the gains from that testing..if it shows you the extreme possible total losses in the trend to be -1000 pips..in reality, based on my method the losses would be way lesser)... Hence, even if i had a 1000 pip gain in the trend..I would be very much profitable. I guess, this is my style of sensitivity analysis!!

Let me tell you the outcome... I've played with the idea of creating an EA with Graeme's approach myself. I used different signals, but signals on the M5 are almost irrelevant. Different signals create different pattern of entries, losses and established positions, but it is of no matter. As long as there is a long-term trend to power their growth. As you've already noticed, the EA creates constant small loses, which is okay. Given enough time, the EA manages to establish a healthy group of positions in line with the main trend. There are only two problems (both concerning the long timeframe in use): 1) Range. During range periods, the EA would still generate constant losses, however, there will not be substantial growth of surviving position to offset these losses. Even more, most (if not all) of the newly established positions will die on break-even, both on buy and sell as D1 crossover flips up and down. 2) Reversal. When the main trend changes (or pulls back for substantial time), the established group would quickly lose both value and positions. The creation of a group in line with the new direction would reduce this effect in time, but Graeme's diversification is a way better approach to handle it, as you capture large profits in the process and reduce your exposure so that the reduction of value is controlled. So you either need a more sophisticated analysis on the long TF (D1 in your case) and programming to handle ranges, keep track on current groups and "diversify" on specific moments (e.g. consolidation), or you need to manage this manually - stop the EA during ranges and diversify by hand. Best regards, Barbossa

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Barbossa: thanks for sharing your valuable ideas and experience.. I agree with you...and I understand the losses.. and yes, Everything is completely random in the market, and especially with the 5 min trading, the death from a 1000 cuts is psychologically unhealthy for almost all individuals. I greatly appreciate your wisdom. I did a similar testing with the "evolved semi-automated" firebird testing here @ FF, and I understand about the losses during the pullback and during ranges..the only difference was that it was "somewhat like" grid-entries into a trend.. now, ranges within the main trend= i don't see a real solution other than turn off the EA, just as you mentioned. But for the pullback.. 1. we could reduce the pullback effect by cutting off some of the retracement, by using a much more sensitive ema...and exiting all our positions. I know with this..we are cutting off the duration that we are staying in the trend..getting out early...BUT, from my visual analysis...if I have a 300-500 pip trend, taking entries on a 15 min chart... that is quite a bit of pips considering I have 5+ positions in the trend... AGAIN..this is an assumption !! (now, this is totally off in terms of the final goals by Pipeasy..because he ideally prefers individual position to remain in the range of 1000's.. esp. some of his positions have reached 8-10,000..I think that's very commendable and deserves accolades.) Now, Diversification, when I see a retracement.. is something, I am willing to test.... it could surely...increase my equity if it turns out to be just a retracement. I know, its not that easy on a D1 chart to test this diversification, I would, maybe have to get on a 4 hr chart for the opposite signals... again, you are right..its not a simple testing of ...bam bam.. but, in-depth "trend within a trend" analysis. Thanks for your ideas...It has helped me in getting a clearer picture and in refining my strategies and what I need to look out for... please feel free to share your thoughts here anytime. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hello, Manny. Diversification would increase your equity no matter where the market goes. Say, you have 5 positions with the main trend, then a pullback starts. You close out the smaller ones for profit, leaving 1 or 2 positions open. If it's just a retracement, chances are your open positions are going to survive it. Once the pullback is over, you'll start adding new positions to replace the closed ones and by the time the market reaches the previous diversification point you would probably have a group of about the same size and floating value. However, you would have banked some cash meantime, resulting in increased balance and equity. Instead of having a large drop in the equity curve. What's not to like? If, on the other hand, it turns out to be reversal, the original positions left (say, group A) are going to die. No reason to mourn them at all, because during the pullback you should be establishing a counter-trend group (call it B), which would quickly become bigger than the remnants of the main-trend one. Because B would be bigger, it's value will grow faster than A's value will drop, hence the overall equity will increase. Once the move stalls, you should do the same, again covering both scenarios as you never know which directions the market will actually go. That's Graeme's philosophy as I understand it. Best regards, Barbossa

I am currently short the Eurodollar based on entry short off the daily chart signal triggered on July 4, 2012 and entered short off the 5 minute chart as the system instructs. Needless to say I have open profits in excess of 40K based on 30 contracts. These are open profits at this time as I do not yet have an exit signal. The system is showing me how to let my profits run. I have struggled with this concept in the past but not any more. Another insight in this system that I received is not to be concerned with small losses and that the odds on any entry are 50/50 since no one knows with certainity where the market will go.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Barbossa, perfect!!...Thanks. I think everybody should read the "millipede thread" if they ever intend to be trading the trends..any TF, doesnt matter. you would start seeing the markets differently.

This is the EA that i am thinking of using ... for testing purpose.. i got this free from the web. this is the only one i found that doesnt close trades.. but can actually let open orders accumulate..which is what i am looking for.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
There's good news and bad news. Good news is I got to stay home from work today and program the EA. The bad news is I have pneumonia. Here is the initial version of the EA for you to look at. It follows the rules outlined in this thread but I'll go over everything to make sure we have a mutual understanding of what this program does. First, the program determines the trend direction. If the daily short ema is above the daily long ema, then the trend is up, otherwise down. Next, it enters on every cross of the short ema of the long ema on the 15 minute charts. As of now, it makes no distinction of those pesky ranging periods where you might get 3 crosses in a row but very little price movement. I might add a filter where the user can tell the program to take trades every so many bars. So after each trade, you need to wait say 8 bars before the next one. But for now, it just takes every trade. Stop losses are set at the previous days high or low. If these are invalid, it defaults to 50 pips. You have the option to use partial closing of orders. If you set the variable CloseHalfAtBreakEven to true, than the program will close half the order at take profit = stoploss and let the rest ride until a change in the daily trend. If you set this to false, orders will only close at either SL (of course) or when there is a change in the daily trend. After doing a little testing, this performed exceptionally well on the big trending currencies and created small losses in others. I didn't do extensive testing though. There's nothing in here to check your account balance or margin requirements yet, this is just meant for experiment with supercats system. Feel free to suggest any additional features that you think would improve performance. Oh ya, since it takes a ton of trades, you need to use mini or microlots. Edit: Run this on the 15M charts.

my friend, you could move the stop to BE whenever you please.. whatever rule you propose follow the same through out.. e.g. lets say if it moves 20-50 pips move it to be ..its your choice. my personal preference is NOT to put it in BE.. instead i enter on 2 lots 1. close one lot when the price violates the high or low of the daily candle. 2. close the second lot only when the daily trend changes(crossing of emas) or, the other way i am trying now, which i have my own doubts about r:r thats again...2 lots. 1. close the first lot when sl=tp 2. let the second lot run till the daily trend changes(crossing of emas) now, its upto you between the 2 options, which one to follow.. or even if you want to use BE(almost everyone will suggest to you to put it in BE..because its a CONFIRMED no-loss thing..but, i just do NOT do it..thats me) thanks, manny

the testing is with raw data, with the mt4 data with a testing accuracy of less than 50%..but, I just wanted to get an idea on the no. of trades/losses, balance, possible dd..etc. just a general idea..now, i am planning to test the brigadier ea with data that has a significant accuracy... the balance drying up, actually made me think..i will survive regardless...but it would be psychologically satisfying, if i could use the 2 lot system that i have always mentioned..that i couldnt use here in testing..i could replenish the account, here and there in the trend. now, these were tested based on the daily 3/5 ema trend system.. for a few pairs.

Amiralifx: your trades are correct.. you are the tiger trend trader-in-chief!! now, answering your question.. both the stop losses should be at the same level..1.5518 since, i think you are moving the SL to BE... ..now, for the first lot...you move SL along the direction of the trade (ONLY when the trade is positive). I will attach a chart for clarity. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #145 ---
you will close the trades only when the exit rules are satisfied.. for 1 lot or 2 lots.. so..that means.. sometimes the trades would run for a week, a month..we don't know.. we want it to keep running till it goes to the moon.

Brigadier: Hope you are feeling better.. this link explains everything.. http://alansforexblog.com/2010/02/10...sting-quality/ for data..i use this.. http://www.forextester.com/data/datasources.html i think it just has 3 months of 1 minute data.. let me know if you find anything better..in terms of duration. I tried backtesting the ttt 1.0 on eurjpy..the results were not looking good. AND when i turned on the visual mode... here is what i saw.. the stop loss was huge for each trade..almost 150 pips.. (which i think, could be the daily high).. here is what i think..please add your thoughts as well.. is there a way you could introduce a user defined sl option.. and/or to set the sl above the high of the 15 min entry candle(not exceeding x pips) because then for a pair like eurjpy the sl will not be more than 20 pips.. EA functionality checks:- t/p works perfect (close half at breakeven), the orders are taken as per signals, it is following the daily signals etc. we could look into the filter thing at the end. also, your testing results are great..how did you manage to get almost every pair in profit.. mine.. @ every test run the..account was being wiped out!! my parameters 15 min, 3/5 ema, slippage dafault...i tried both, close partial and turned off partial. BTW..I do appreciate your time and help with this ea... thanks, manny

Are you using a 5 digit broker? I'm using FXCM so the behavior will be totally wrong if you are using 4 digit precision. Eur/jpy did produce losses for me. I think it just about broke even when using partial closing of orders. Using daily highs and lows for stoplosses produced much better results for me. I tested using 15M highs and lows and the balance just oscilates around breakeven. I can easily add the option to select the time frame you want for the stop loss; 15M, 1H, 1D, whatever. I could also add a hard stoploss option if you want the same stoploss distance each trade.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Come to think of it, since I'm using daily highs and lows for stoplosses, and since we're mainly closing trades on a daily time frame, I don't believe it's necessary to achieve 90% modeling quality. It shouldn't matter that trades may close with a few pips error in the simulation when most trades are held open for days.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Brigadier: Hope you are feeling better. Regarding the ttt ver1.0 testing results:- the reason my account was getting wiped out was, I think because.. I was using a 10,000 account for mini orders.. now, when I see the drawdown here, its impossible to use a mini account because the drawdown is over 100%. so, just for testing sake..i used a 100,000 usd account. here are the results for the period from april to july of 2012 : interpreting that to a 10,000 dollar micro account(dime account). eurnzd.. dd -24% net gain 41% g. loss -14% eurusd.. dd -22% net gain -8% g. loss -23% eurjpy.. dd -29% net gain 19% g. loss -23% these results are too early to psych-evaluate the EA.. but, I want to test the exact working all the way... through the entire time period on a visual mode..to exactly see the behaviour, esp. the trend closing and opening. what is the syntax that you have used to close all entries(end of trend)..with respect to the the daily candle (where the cross happens)? (in english..lol) also, please, add a hard stop loss, where I could enter smaller SL.. I think I will take this entire week to study this(as I have couple of things along with this), and what improvements could be done..as I see a lot of potential in this. please add your thoughts as well. thanks, manny p.s: for some reason, it doesnt seem to be taking any trades on my metaquotes tester with 90% data (its 5 digits)...do you experience that?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
OK, with 1.0, it is possible to have a margin call simply because your balance drops due to having so many open trades, regardless of whether they are all in profit. I saw that and added some code to prevent the EA from opening new trades when you reach a user specified percent of margin level. So if you're margin drops below a certain percent, it will wait for some trades to close before opening new ones. If you want to test with $10,000, I'd suggest using mini lots. Closing Trades in an Uptrend We are in an uptrend when the short EMA is above the long EMA on the daily charts. We will only take long positions in this uptrend. The uptrend ends and we close all open long positions when the short EMA closes below the long EMA on the daily charts. Closing Trades in an Downtrend We are in a downtrend when the short EMA is below the long EMA on the daily charts. We will only take short positions in this downtrend. The downtrend ends and we close all open short positions when the short EMA closes above the long EMA on the daily charts. I'll post the new EA later today or tomorrow. I'll include these stoploss options: Place stop loss at the previous day's high or low Place stop loss at the previous day's high or low, up to a specified maximum value. If high or low is beyond this value, the stop loss is placed at this maximum allowed distance. Hard stop loss. The stop loss is always this specified value. Anything else? Although I said previous day's high or low, I have an option for you to specify the time frame of this high or low. For example, you may use the previous hour's high or low, the previous 15M bar high or low, or whatever you want.

Brigadier: been a little busy with stuff.. anyways..thank you for your thoughts and ideas.. you said user specified limits so as to not to have a margin call..where do i specify that in the ea? ok..now the EA exits the series of trend trades..when the EMA cross happens..so, now could you please include the trades to be closed only after the daily candle has closed, after the cross has occured. lets call this experimental version..ttt ver1.1 ok.. now for the SL conditions.. I am cool with all the 3 of them that you proposed. that would be great!! (would it be possible to change from daily high/low to 15 min high/low for the SL) Thanks, Manny

i am testing it as a semi-automatic ea..meaning if i were to physically turn on and turn off the ea, depending on the trend.. then, in every aspect, the backtest WORKS PERFECT!! just like the way I want.. hmmm!!..even the DD is super low!!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hey Supercat hows your trading going. I think I missed something here. I've been using the your system but I get confused at times and wanted to confirm something. When your waiting for your entry trigger, you get the crossoover then the arrow. Then you stated you wait for the 2nd confirmation (??) whats the 2nd 1? Is it a candle closing on the other side? I've read over it again and I'm missing the 2nd confirmation you speak of. I've been making a few good trades but a few bad 1's as well, guess that goes with trading. Right now it's been a 50/50 so I felt I was missing something. Oh, wanted to say that I've been testing the Crossover EA also on Demo on EURUSD and it's been doing pretty good, shamefully better than I am, LOL Thanks

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Brigadier, manny. I've been absent from this thread for a while now.... long enough to get utterly frustrated with my own trading and i am now looking forward to following and testing your system. i was thinging i would put together an EA to trade this strategy as it really would be better if I was not involved in day to day decisions. ... then i see that you guys have already started. i intend to begin testing your EA this weekend, is there any modifications / refinements that you were thinking of which you might like some assistance?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hey Manny Supercat I do have 1 more question for you, besides the 2nd confirmation, how long before you start stacking more orders into you trades, how many pips before you add more orders? Sorry if I've missed this somewhere. Eve if I do use the EA I'll still be wanting to master this method. With great thanks to you for sharing this info with us.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi, I read the topic. And i like this trading method. I like trend trading. But my english is poor. I want to ask , what do you use EMA cross lastly? On daily =? On 15 m =? And how do you set stoploss for first entry. I will be gratefull if you help. I am really sorry for english. And which pairs can be good for this trading method. Thank you and have a nice day... And thanks to supercat for sharing this method.

coolyman: i havent been trading, i have been busy with so MANY things.. i still havent found a place to settle down so i can set up a PC exclusive for trading. I will be soon... and I will post all my trades here when I do it. answering your question.. go to the daily trend..e.g. if its down..then you only take short/sell orders now, go to the 15 min or 5 min chart, wait for a sell signal. now, if this is the first sell signal(ema cross) after a small uptrend DO NOT TAKE IT.. wait for the second sell signal (ema cross)... now..take this entry..this is somewhat of a confirmation of the downtrend. again, nothing is guaranteed in trading.. at the end of the month..even if your entries were correct only 20-30% of the time, but if the trend had lasted for 300-500 pips.. you will be in profit without a doubt!! does that answer your question? thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #165 ---
stacking: it depends on your screen time..and your timeframe.. if you are using 5 mins for entry..i think you cannot go crazy with it.. because there will be too many entries..and you might face a lot of these tiny losses in a row..now, with 15 mins...i think you could take most of it. (assuming the SL is very low) between orders, maybe a buffer of 10-20 pips (15 min entries) would be great..because if its a tight range there would be multiple entries so close by, i think its not worth it. and again..when in doubt...DO NOT ENTER.. because with this method as long as you are with the trend.. you will have many ..many chances to get in again. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Carlito my friend, thanks for your kindness in helping this cause.. as you know, brigadier has programmed this EA called TTT ver1.0.. and now.. We are including a few minor changes like SL modification etc. I would love that you could help us in testing.. if you could help us with backtesting that would be great. Brigadier would post the modified EA..VER1.1, here with the changes... my thing is..if all of us could finish the backtests with confident numbers then, we could get into forward testing on a demo with this ea, soon..because i see a lot of promise and PIPS. thanks for the help and I will keep you posted here thanks, manny

Selim: I am explaining it with gbpusd as an example.. if you see the daily..its in an uptrend..3/5 ema now, go to the 15 min chart with 3/5 ema i have shown on the chart my entries and stop loss placement. i place my sl below the candle when the cross occurred + 2-5 pips safety net. about the pairs.. I prefer the trending pairs almost all the majors except usdcad... then, I love eurnzd, gbpnzd, gbpchf, eurjpy, gbpjpy etc. I do NOT like EURCHF. thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Brigadier: hope you are feeling better.. I hate to do this..But, I completely forgot about it..initially, I had a request to implement the following logic for stop loss.. is there any way you could implement the below syntax for stop loss.. this is the 15 min chart, with entries on the candle at the 3/5 ema cross (on every cross per main trend) and sl exactly below the candle we entered + 3-5 pips... instead of setting sl below the previous low. well..I think we could ...keep the sl options as:- 1. high/low of previous 15 min (with a restricted pip value) 2. hard stop loss 3. low/high of the current candle close @ ema cross, on 15 min chart (attached a chart for visual clarity) let me know if its ok with you? I hope I am not messing with your focus..sorry. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #169 ---
There's nothing to like in EURCHF since last year. No long term trends to ride, the pair is pretty much dead. Not even worth a look until SNB drops its support. I'm curious on how you select pairs to trade, though. Personal discretion? Barbossa

I like the big movers..like gbpusd, eurjpy, eurnzd etc. they have long lasting trends that go for many pips.. on the daily. most of the majors are generally safe because they trend, except usdcad.

My friend, are you using manual entries or ea? thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thanks for the reply's Manny, they are very helpful. Sometime I can't see the forest cuz the tree's are in my way. I'll be watching more closely now. I've been back testing the EA but I've placed it on the EURJPY and it's been running for a few days now and it hasn't placed any orders. What TF is it set for?? Looking forward to testing the new version out as soon as it gets posted. I trade on ILQ and forex.com , been testing it on demo with forex.com. Back tested the EA on M15 and it lost half of the account. Ran it on H1 and come out with apx +1450(+/-), running it now on daily but it super slow so I'll post it when I get it done. Any ideals when the new version is coming out. I have the old 1 running on demo, the crossover EA without a exit on EURUSD and it been doing pretty good so far. Happy pippin everyone

hello, I saw that you use entry based on 15m TF and 5m TF, which of these 2 kinds of entries are better? Do u have any personal advice?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I have tried both... i prefer the 15 min over 5min...as I am trying this system on an ea. 5 min entries..there will be too many losses..(your losses will be very small) BUT when the trend gets the momentum...you will have tonnes of pips in positive!!

Bergax: I see the daily candle on eurjpy..wow...its a beautiful day!! ..thats awesome you did make some healthy pips.. anyways..if i choose them?.. no..i dont..if its there i take it!! because i do not have the power to predict which one will stand or which one will die.. with a systems trading.. if you have to trade signals..you have to take it when u see it.. now, set your own rules if you see too many signals too close.. lets say in a range of 5-20 pips..take maybe 1 or 2 trades.. but, if it is a healthy trend..go for it..I am talking about the 15 min TF. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Bergax: I am assuming you are using the manual entries as opposed to the ea? right? thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi supercat, Firstly, congratulations for your job ! I have a problem, i have correctly installed your ea "TT v1" on a lot of charts but since yesterday, I have no trade open whereas the ea "Kollier' opened a lot of trades. Is it normal ? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I have been using manual entries based on 5m TF so far, I will see if 15m TF with less false signals is not better. I hope I will try it next week. I am thinking about managing opened positions, like partial closes or something like that. Divide position into 2-5 smaller and closing according to reverse signal on 5, 15m TF, simply I do not want to let positions those are + 100 pips go into a lose. Can I know how long do u use this system? Thank you for answers. Regards

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Bergax: Absolutely, thats how it should be!! thanks for your ideas, input and the big help..i greatly appreciate it. I have the same thought process...but with the ea testing..I am taking it as a step by step approach....and then, eventually to know the most effective partial close strategy.. Brigadier had programmed sl=tp as partial close..meaning closing 50% of the order..which is almost as good as BE. now, initially i had proposed 2 order entries in this thread.. which i think is very effective in a trending period, mostly.. entering with 2 lots and closing 1 lot when there is a violation of the daily candle high or low..again, i am working on the finer details of partial exit!! FYI...its explained here in detail.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...48#post5838948 about the system.. its still a work in progress..collection of ideas that would evolve into a "definite set of rules" that yields profit.. to be precise..3 months or so.. again, I would like to say..thus so far, its to be categorized as "testing" instead of '"trading".. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I am thinkng that good choice for partial closing is like you said open 2 smaller positions. next possibilieties are: 1) After X pips close 1 position and second half move to BE. I like the idea moving the second half to BE because, if the retracement will be so big that the price return to the entry point there is higher possibility of getting a SL after that. That retracement will create other options to enter back when the price get again favourable direction. 2) Closing positions according daily candles, breaking low/high of previous day candle. It will give more breath to the trades, but I would like to squeeze as more pips as possible and closing according daily candles is about -100/+100 pips difference. 3) Simply trail the positions. I dont like this option. 4) Close half after opossite signal on 15M or 5M, but just when the signal is created at least 50-100 pips, it will make no sense after that. I love this system because it could be effective and simple to use.

Well, I haven't change setting fort the ea TT v1. But I have used the kollier ea and I have a lot of great results indeed but it's very difficult to exit each trade when you don't have the time to wait on the computer all the day. It should be interesting to program exit for the ea kollier but I think it's difficult. Thanks again for all, Have a good week end.

Thanks man. Have you changed the setting of the ea Koliier ? That is to say, put EMA 3,5 and not 5,10 ?

Goodgame: yes, its 3/5 ema for the daily and the 15 mins. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Run this on the 15 minute chart or whatever you have PeriodShort set to when testing. ShortEMA - the quick ema for the longer time frame, such as the 3 on daily LongEMA - the slow ema for the longer time frame, such as 5 on daily FastShortEMA - the quick ema for the shorter time frame, such as 3 on 15M FastLongEMA - the slow ema for the shorter time frame, such as 5 on 15M PeriodLong - period of the longer time frame (daily) PeriodShort - period of the shorter time frame (15M) Type - type of MA; simple, ema, etc Lots - number of lots per trade Slippage - maximum slippage in price Minimum margin - the EA will stop taking trades if margin free margin falls below this percent StopLossType - 0 means you will only use a hard stop loss predefined by the variable HardStopLoss; 1 means you will set stops at the high or low of the current bar of the time frame specified by StopLossPeriod; 2 or anything else will set the stop at the previous high or low of the time frame specified by StopLossPeriod up to the MaxStopLoss, if this is breached then MaxStopLoss is used, if this is invalid, HardStopLoss is used Padding - when setting the stop loss based on the current or previous bar, this extra padding is added to the high or low for the stop loss StopLossPeriod - the time frame you want to use for setting the stop loss from a candlestick MaxStopLoss - the maximum allowed value for a stop loss HardStopLoss - used with StopLossType 0 or with 2 when the previous day's high or low creates an invalid stop loss CloseHalfAtBreakEven - close half the order at TP = SL RangeUp - The distance you want price to move from the last trade before you want a new order to be placed. Suppose this is set to 150 (15 pips with a 5 digit broker) and your last trade was placed at 1.000. A new order will not be placed if an entry signal is spotted within the range or 1.000 to 1.0015, but will at 1.0016+. RangeUp - The distance you want price to move from the last trade before you want a new order to be placed. Suppose this is set to 150 (15 pips with a 5 digit broker) and your last trade was placed at 1.000. A new order will not be placed if an entry signal is spotted within the range or 1.000 to 1.0085, but will at 1.0084-. If both RangeUp and RangeDown are set to 0, then every signal will result in a trade. Pip values are set for a 5 digit broker. If you want padding to be 10 pips on a 5 digit broker set it to 100. I'm assuming you would just type 10 for a 4 digit broker but I have not tested this with one. I did not do exhaustive testing so please report any errors or results.

supercat, thanks for sharing your wonderful system. Having read all of the 14 pages of your thread, I like this simple but highly effective trading system. I got one question. is it still effective to use your original setup"3/20 ema on daily chart,9/20 ema in 5 min chart?" your developed system are using 3/5 ema, does it work the same? thanks Joey

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Manny, Glad to see the new version of the EA, the older version was working but I hadn't seen any real profits from it, but then again I only had it running about 1 week. Although even with the crossover EA I was banking some good pips on my Demo account. Manual trading I was delighted to see Sundays balance at over 300 plus pips. I banked 200 of them and am up 300 more pips now before midnight. I might bank another 200 pips before I go to bed and let the rest run with the trends. I've got my platform set up so I can easily scan through my charts. Set aside the coming possible set up's and stack up the others, then I can easily scan through the possible 1's through out the day and place my trades as they set up. I've been having problems back testing, I'm new at it so go figure, LOL. I downloaded the strategy tester and trying to get it working so I can give ya some more results. I've added the new EA to a set of charts to run demo on and I'll keep ya informed. Thanks again for helping to become a better trader

i've downloaded the indicators and templates provided by supercat. During the study. I get two questions. 1.When does the indicator give the signal? After the candle closed or during the candle is forming? 2. about the entry strategy. Once the daily chart gives a sell signal(as following picture), we shift the 5 or 15 min chart to wait a sell signal? am i right? if not, please correct. thanks.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
and what does" enter only on the second consecutive signal" mean? if the daily chart gives a sell signal. we look down to 5 min chart to seek sell signal, we ignore the first sell signal? hope someone could help me understand this. many thanks.

hi hotjoy excuse me . i dont speak english very well. 1.After the candle closed. its better for waiting candle closed in daily tf . 2- yes

Looking over all the testing data for the past few months paints a rosier protrait of trading conditions than they should actually be. GBP/NZD and EUR/NZD were perfect scenarios for trading this system from May until the present. Too good perhaps, because the data during that time frame did not mimic the full range of market conditions. Nevertheless, GBP/NZD and EUR/NZD still produce strong results in the long term. I like the main idea of this system: determine the long trend and let the profits run while cutting losses. It boils down to three things. 1) Devise an accurate method for predicting the long term trend. I think what we may want to conceptualize first here is a system where we only take the first trade of a daily trend. So we detect the daily trend, and place one trade and leave it until we detect the opposite trend. If we cannot accurately pick the daily trend; that is account for range sections, ultimately trades are doomed. 2) Devise a method for adding entries that limits trading during range based periods. We could, of course just open a new trade every new bar in the 15M and let these stacked positions ride the trend, but we would be destroyed during range periods. We need to add entries, in such as manner, that we don't place a bunch of orders in a situation like the one depicted below. 3) Possibly develop a new exit condition. Something I noticed is that we tend to lose a decent about near the end of a trend because of the lag inherent in MAs. Check out the pick below. We were hit with a slew of losses near the end and because of the large number of open trades, it also meant forfeiting many, many pips. Maybe there's a better way to deal with this.

Brigadier: Thanks for the ea.. I am testing it.. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Joey: you are welcome.. I am testing on 3/5 emas.. but see if your entries are on 5min charts..then, it would be ok to use 9/20...or infact any ema combo that makes sense.. whether you want a fast reacting one or slow.. the 3/5 will have more entries and small losses.. the 9/20 is much more conservative.. 1.When does the indicator give the signal? After the candle closed or during the candle is forming? 2. about the entry strategy. Once the daily chart gives a sell signal(as following picture), we shift the 5 or 15 min chart to wait a sell signal? am i right? if not, please correct. I think Amiralifx answered the question..let me try to add something.. in the indicator properties (ma ribbons)..you have an option to set the alerts to alert @ close candle to true or false.. i set it to true..that means the signal is generated only after the candle has closed. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Brigadier: I have been testing with the majors..eurusd and gbpusd.. one of the thing i am trying here is using a bigger ema for daily trend.. it is just easy on the eyes with the gains.. I am thinking on the similar lines esp..with an exit strategy to retain some of the hard earned pips.. because we are losing sometimes a 1000+ pips depending on the length of the daily candle of the opposite signal (exit candle).. also, I am coming to find out that sl=tp is not very effective..maybe very little. anyways...I am thinking!! thanks for your help brigadier in developing the ea. i appreciate your efforts. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #216 ---
my friend supercat, thanks to your kind sharing for this wonderful system. I trade with this system manually; and it works good. Now iam testing the EA; so far it works so well, too. I get one questions. how does the EA automatically add positions after the signal gets confirmed? I mean the logical of the system? when i manually trade the MA ribbon system , how do i add positions? thanks PS: the trading results is so great. i am still demo on it. Guys could see my performance.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
hotjoey, If you're talking about TTT 1.1, then it adds new order with every signal on the M15 or (ShortPeriod). So if the daily trend is down, it will sell every time it sees a MA cross on the M15. Essentially, it should trade no differently than if you were doing everything manually.

I see that Brigadier answered your question.. also, i would like to share some thoughts.. I would like to say that it would be nice to do a partial close based on any of the rules here..so that you retain some of the pips.. maybe use the daily chart (or hourly chart).. it will build your confidence!!!! as you know, the EA is still in this FF-think-tanks(i mean all of us) wall breaking phase, i am sure there will be some more of the healthy improvements... meanwhile..please keep running it!! thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Brigadier, With your permission, I would like to offer some constructive criticism. In the first place, the exits are not the problem, the entries are. By entering on every signal, you're increasing your risk proportionally to your exposure. While you should aim to increase your exposure while keeping your risk relatively static. You could use different approaches for this - for example, you could only enter a new position if all the opened positions are in profit and their SL is set at BE. This will give you a vast number of breakevens, however, it will also reduce dramatically the drawdown. The big number of entries could still cause 'account bleeding', though, especially in ranges. To handle ranges, you could intentionally 'ignore' areas when you recently lost a position (e.g. you don't take a trade if the price didn't move at least 20-30p from the last loss). Last, but not least, there is no such thing as accurate method of predicting the long term trend. Also, you don't need one. Your aim should be to place as many positions as possible on the right side of the trend, while keeping losses as small as possible. How do you do that? By entering positions, moving SL to BE and letting them either grow or die. If they are on the correct side of the trend - which you could never know for sure at the time you enter - they are going to survive and grow. If not, they die at BE and you lose nothing. If you're still not happy with the results and think a lot more than needed positions die because of random fluctuations, you could use an 'intermediate' signal - say, H1 ema cross in the opposite direction - to evaluate the status of the group and close some of the smaller positions to reduce your exposure and bank some pips. Hope that helps. Please keep in mind, that all examples are just things I thought of 'on the fly'. I've never tried them in the context of the system discussed here, some I've never tried at all. They are by no means a recommendation. I'm just giving them as a reference to what I would think of first. Best regards, Barbossa

Hi Guys, Sorry if I have not understood correctly.. I agree with the system as I have been following this for last 2-3 weeks. Can someone explain why below on daily says BUY using MA-5 &amp; 10 and on M15 SELL- if i took all buy then all looses. I understand sometime it is loss but is there anything which I am missing.... Thanks Sham

I never gave you permission... j/k Ok, well if you look at the second point I made, I had said that we need to draft some refined entries on the 15 minute charts, so that we don't flood the market with precarious trades when we get a high volume of signals. The idea of increasing exposure without increasing risk certainly makes sense. I'll try testing this out on previous data. Only open new trades after the last trade has been set to BE. Set trades to break even when... uh, I'll have to experiment with that. I still think we can improve trend exits though. At the end of a trend we have so many trades open that waiting for an MA cross can lead to a lot of lost profit. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad if range period drawdown is reduced, but this is still worth looking into.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Waiting for the MA crossover can be improved upon for sure. However, how do you know it's the end of the trend and not just a pullback? Back in "Building equity millipede" there was a description of a nice aggressive position management that tackled the issue. Suppose you're building a short group. Whenever a candle closes above the most recent down candle on the higher TF, close half of the opened positions. That way you'll quickly scale out of the market on a trend change, while you'll still have some positions left in case it's only a pullback and the trend resumes. Yeah, you'll still lose some potential profits, however, you'll be more flexible. Worth some backtesting maybe? Sincerely, Barbossa

just now， after the US markets opening, the system again gives signal. I enter demo and wait for the growth of the profit.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
hi, shamnonu, i get two answers for u. hope it can make things clear. first. any system get wrong signals. there is no holy grail on earth. supercat told us at the beginning that his system's win rate is lower than 50%(30%).Still, the system can bring profit. why? the failed trades are very small losses. but the wins can make u rich. hence, just stick to the engaging rules (supercat said, u could build confidence). second. about the entry rules. u could re-read it at page 1. Or u could check the posts by supercat @ page1 and the posts @ page 14. A friend gave examples for me on how to use the system correctly. about the the pair u choose:usdcad. it seems supercat said that is not very good choice for the system. good luck.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Thanks hotjoey.. I agree and will go back again to read the page. Just need to make sure I am following the system correctly.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
well.. Although I think pipeasy's method to be the greatest trend trading education I have ever received in my life...my personal choice is NO BE.. But, I am willing to look at the results with BE on all entries. Anyways.. I have always looked at the gross losses for some reason to give me an idea if the EA will stand a chance to fight the monster in the cage.. (i do know that the cluster trades are bothersome) so far with the crude testing on a few pairs..it is excellent!! Maybe, banking some pips will be great because... we are losing a lot of the floating equity, during the trend change I tried to lessen this by using a much more sensitive ema as the signal. thanks, manny

the only thing that i dislike about these results is the floating dd..its big for a dime account.. now, this dd is what we are losing when the trend changes.. and I do want to to retain at least 20%-50% of those losing pips when the trend change happens(or at least +20% overall..whatever) Brigadier, I do think the ea is great..or at least, i want to see it in a very holistic manner..its all right to me...believe me..in the long run it will kick ass!! but.. if you could please incorporate just one addition, that would make it even more effective (I think as per my initial rule)..in banking more pips..by a PARTIAL trailing stop..on the daily candle.. please look into it when you find some free time. this is again a 1/2 close option!! (because i just feel that tp=sl is not doing any good in the long run) here are the details.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...48#post5838948 please let me know your thinking as well.. thanks, manny

--- 帖子 #236 ---
lets say, if you stand to gain these net gains or the whereabouts, from the past two months..its a significant increase in your account balance!! 20% on 1 pair is really good from a 3 month period.. but, i am sure with super-pairs like gbpnzd and eurnzd..it will go crazy!!

Although even with the crossover EA I was banking some good pips on my Demo account. Manual trading I was delighted to see Sundays balance at over 300 plus pips. I banked 200 of them and am up 300 more pips now before midnight. I might bank another 200 pips before I go to bed and let the rest run with the trends. I've got my platform set up so I can easily scan through my charts. Set aside the coming possible set up's and stack up the others, then I can easily scan through the possible 1's through out the day and place my trades as they set up. I've been having problems back testing, I'm new at it so go figure, LOL. I downloaded the strategy tester and trying to get it working so I can give ya some more results. I've added the new EA to a set of charts to run demo on and I'll keep ya informed. Thanks again for helping to become a better trader [/quote]

Hello everyone, I'm pretty new to FF, so I only just found this thread, its a system thats quite similar to one I use so I hope I can learn a bit off you and hopefully even contribute to the thread a bit more in the future. One question about the EA. I set it up on afew charts on demo this morning and it seems to be running fine. However I cannot get it to backtest successfully. The journal in the strategy tester has 2 messages; tester;margin exchange rate can not be calculated tester;exchange rate can not be calculated Am I missing something obvious here or can anyone suggest a fix? I do think the ability to backtest many different t/f's and ma combos and find the best setup for each pair should give a big edge in trying to make this type of system profitable in the longer term. BTW I like a 6, 14 ema combo, I don't know if thats better than 3, 5 maybe a bit slower entries but less false starts. if I can manage to get this Ea backtesting I'll let you know Thanks for any feedback Lille Bror

--- 帖子 #242 ---

--- 帖子 #244 ---
what do you mean by macd phase?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Don't know whats going on with the EA, I've tried a few different settings and different TF, different currencies and the EA just keeps losing. It does make a few good trades but the loses are much more. Took a bad hit on my trades during that crazy stuff last night, but getting things back together and getting those pips. So now trying to make back some pips. Could have been worse. This method is a winner and I've been making steady pips With time I'll be even better with it.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
coolyman, Post your EA settings if you're having a problem. I ran the EA on GBP/NZD and got hit hard by the volatility yesterday. The EA should be trading exactly what you would trade manually with the system, so if the EA is doing poorly all your manual trades would have done poorly as well. There is no magic going on here. If you see that the EA is placing trades irrationally, then please point this out with your settings so I can fix it. Also supercat, I added the partial closure of trades at the violation of a daily high/low. Did you want this to go into effect right when the Ask price violates the high or should we wait for a candle to close. Right now I have it implemented as the first option.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I missed today's best opportunity. eurjpy and eurusd. Since the signals were given, they could have brought much pips. But i went out for dinner. So, i didnt catch the 140 pips of eurjpy. My order on Xagusd got triggered after my leave; it's still running on profit. Guys could build ur confidence on the system by strictly sticking ro the entry rules; no matter how it make losses in choppy market.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi,Brigadier i have two questions about using the EA. 1. having added the EA to chart, do i need add the MA ribbon indicators to charts which're provided by supercat? 2.Since the EA is based on 3/5 ema crosses on 15 min and daily charts. Do i need change the parameters of the indicators(supercats' indicators are the original 3/20 9/20 ema) or just add the EA to chart? Thanks for ur effort on EA.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
HI MY FRIEND eurjpy in bearish in daily tf. why you buy it? you should waiting for sell segnal. good luck

--- 帖子 #250 ---
hotjoey, Run the EA on the smaller (fast) timeframe chart. This in all likelihood means the 15 minute time frame. Set PeriodShort to 15 in the variable settings. The EA will function regardless of the indicators on your chart, but you may add the supercat's MA ribbons if you like. That's probably a good idea so you can confirm trades. You can change the daily MAs with ShortEMA and LongEMA and the 15 minute MAs with the "Fast" versions of these variables. This doesn't need to match what you have on the chart, but it may get visually confusing if they don't.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hmm, I have never encountered that problem. Were you backtesting on a currency or an index? I'm in the US so I have no clue what will happen when you run this on indices or metals. Also, though this may have nothing to do with your problem, all the external variables are set for a 5 digit broker. 140 = 14 pips on a 5 digit broker. 14 = 14 pips on a 4 digit broker, but I never tested this on a 4 digit account. Just something to keep in mind.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Brigadier, Thanks for the Ea work. it looks to have great potential. I still can't get it to backtest, that error message appeared when testing gbp/usd, ea standard settings, 5 digit broker. I will just have to backtest visually to come up with appropriate settings for what I want.then forward test on demo to check results. I did put it on 8 charts on demo today to test functionality with the different trade management options. I added appropriate ma's to visually confirm what was happening and I took the time settings down to 1min and 15min just so it would take a lot of trades so I could see what it was doing. 2 of the charts were gold and brent crude the other 6 were standard currency pairs. I was not worried about trading results just a functionality test. In general it performed very well. there was some erratic behaviour at the start but that may have just been because I was still jumping around the timeframes and settings too much and throwing it out of balance. however there were a couple of things that came up more then once so I may aswell let you know. One thing was that the range option was not always complied with, i had trades opened just 2 or 5 pips away from previous orders even when the range up and down were both set to 100 or 250. the second was with stoploss option 1, I had this set to 60min, the s/l was placed behing the high/low of the current bar correctly but when the 60min bar changed the s/l followed it, I don't know if this was intended but basically in the first minute the s/l equalled the bar opening meaning that buffer was the full s/l, I had this set to 30 and the trade basically just got bounced out within seconds of the bar change. I'm not hat bothered by that one i prefer option 1 anyway. As an additional question, in s/l option 2, is that supposed to keep moving up behind previous bars high/low? I had some trades close seemingly randomly before they hit the printed s/l. If that was the reason I like it, its good way to trail a stop to close the trades. If its not the reason, its a bit worrying. even with those slight flaws it is still a very good Ea and I like it a lot. BTW it worked on gold and brent just like it did on fx, no problems. I will leave it running on a bunch of charts tomorrow and let you know if any thing comes up or if it all settles down. Cheers Lille bror

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Brigadier My settings are the same, I don't get it. I've played with the MA's some but the basic's are still the same. I've noticed that it would trade on different TF's but it close out the trades after about 15 pips, if it gets a good trade, but it gets SL out most of the time. Thats why I've tried different MA's but still the same thing happens???

--- 帖子 #254 ---
hello again, i've just been going through some more of the trades and can say pretty certainly,(for my PC anyway), that In s/l options 1 and 2 the ea is trailing the s/l behind the change of bar. This is not shown in the terminal. this is a particular problem with option 1, for the reasons I stated in the previous post. I only had a buffer of 30 to represent 2 x s/l but it meant i had a s/l of just 3pips when the bar changed. the same happens with option 2, trailing behind the previous bar. like I said I quite like this and it should not be a problem when using daily for the s/l, i just had it set to 6omin for this testing and some 60min bars are very small at this time of day so the s/l became very small when the bar changed. this change of s/l with the bar change is not edited in the trade readout in the terminal but seems to be carried out by the ea itself so it can appear a bit random when the trade stops out 30pips from the s/l but actually seems quite logical. maybe that explains some of the losses people are seeing. maybe a fixed value trailing s/l would be an easier option? no ideas about the rangeup/down thing. most of the time it seems to be obeyed but sometimes not. Btw I am thinking I would probably switch the ea off after US session close to avoid entering during the typically low volatilty sideways asian, Cheers Lille bror

Lille Bror: Thanks for helping us in forward testing. Excellent!!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
latest update I changed the range of settings i was running to include different timeframes and came up with something interesting. The premature closure is definately something to do with candle changes but not neccesarily related to dragging up the s/l. I am now running 12 charts, 3 timeframes, 1min with 15min i run 2 on stoploss type 0, size 300, one is set to TP at BE one is not 2 are set to stoploss type 2, period 60 one is set to TP at BE one is not other tf's are 5min with 60min 15min with 240min same set of 4 charts with stoploss period set to 240 and 1440 respectively. Ok so the interesting thing was that there was that there was a whole bunch of trades running across the range of timeframes, exactly when the half hour changed all of the trades opened on the 1 ,15min tf's, across all relevant pairs, closed abitrarily while all the trades running on the higher TF's kept runningthis has happened 3 consecutive times and it didn't matter which stoploss method was selected. this set has not been running too long yet so maybe the same thing will happen to the higher TF trades at a longer interval I will have to wait and see. maybe anyone else who has had problems with trades closing arbitrarily could check the times they closed to see if they happened at candle changes or if they happened simultaneously across different pairs. Incidentally, the rangeup/down settings seem to be holding on all trades so far I am running on a 5 digit broker, each setup running on a seperate pair so that they don't interfere with each other. I chose the 1,15 min combo purely as a way to see it carry out a lot of trades in a short time. I'll let you know what happens with the other setups tomorrow. Cheers Lille bror

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hello again, so I have just been going through the trades that ran through the night and have one last update. nearly all the 5min 60min trades shut down too with just a couple left running, all the 5min 240 are still running, however There were some trades that lasted through 1 or more bar changes but did shut down later. I might be wrong but as far as I can see it lines up like this. when the higher TF candle changes, all Negative trades are closed, positive trades seem to be left to run. I had missed this just running ,1,15 settings because there was too little time for trades to turn positive before the next candle change but it became more apparent on the 5,60. So thats about all I think I can do right now, I hope it helps. I do hope the bugs can be ironed out and I look forward to version 2, I really think this EA has potential if it works properly Cheers Lille Bror

hello again, just one last thought on the ea, my ideal take profit method would probably be a close all order on a price close below a single ma on a timeframe and period which you can specify in the options but not neccesarily the same as the ones used for initiating trades. I think that would be very versatile. so that will be the last from me for a while but i'll come back and help forward test again if you get version 2 running. good luck with everything Lille Bror

Hi manny, I have long term (10yrs) data for the following pairs AUDJPY, AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPCHF, GBPUSD and NZDUSD. I did some preliminary testing on using v1.0 and results were not good but I think the main problem was entries with daily high/low as SL. And significant losses at trend changes. I'll let you know how I go. And try to remember were I got the data from so I can go out and seek some more for the cross pairs that you are more interested in. Cheers, Carlitodog

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Ok thanks for the error reports. It's very strange that you are seeing a trailing stoploss because there is absolutely no code to modify orders once they are opened. There is nothing to trail. The only code that closes orders, closes them on a ShortEMA cross LongEMA. At a glance yesterday, all my orders during testing were closing fine, however I just tested briefly. I'll look into these issues in more detail this weekend, try to replicate them, and hopefully get something new out.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hello brigadier, first, thanks for the work. I would just clarify that the orders are not modified in the trade window they are closed by Ea itself. but this does happen precisely on the change of the long TF candle and only applies to trades that are currently negative. If you want to post me a copy that doesn't include the code to close orders on the ema recross i can run the same set of tests on it to see if thats where the glitch is coming in. also if anyone else out there wants to run a copy on the 1 and 15 min TF's we should be able to see quite quickly if its a built in problem or just something that affects my setup. cheers Lille Bror

Carlitodog: Thanks man.. you are the "elite tester"..with 10yr data..wow! please, I would love to get my hands on that data!! yes, i understand that..i saw that with ver1.0..hence the evolution of ver1.1, please..try the ver1.1 it has varying SL options so that you could reduce your losses. I used fixed stop losses(option 0) for most currencies that i tested.. what i used.. For the majors and yen crosses; approx... 10-25 pips. eurnzd, i tried with 30-40 pips....because of the high spread. you could also try other sl options, 1 or 2 whichever you feel like. Brigadier has done an excellent job in providing this!! I know, 10 year testing would be A TASK.. I would be very happy just to see 1 year or 2 years of backtests performed on select few pairs just to see gross losses.. thanks, manny

Hi Manny, I got my data free from the net. http://www.forextester.com/data/datasources.html The easiest way to use it is to setup a separate install of MT4 dedicated to backtesting, import the data and use the EA's in MT4's inbuilt strategy tester.... you need to have the relevant symbols imported from a demo account in order to import the data, but then you can delete the demo account. Will post some results later today or tomorrow. Good luck setting it up.

Hi for all Tiger followers This is my 1st post in this FF thread because impressed by this Tiger Trading System,before any further sorry for my english because english is not my mother's tongue. I keep observing the progress of this Tiger since it was 'born',it's seems one of the promising long term term trading strategy (good for swinger and intra day trader).For scalpers out there,I dont think this tiger is your friend,so dont waste your time look at this tiger unless for those who want to change trading style.The miracle about this system is how it let the tiger running with positive pips until the tiger really exhausted. Since I'm a bit slow learner (too old already..he he..my cpu cannot be loaded with everything at one time)..I will try to follow this tiger step by step,looking for the strength,limitation,loop hole or whatsoever because I really get impressed by this tiger....great job to Supercat.....credit should be given to you.

I'm going to Boston for the week. Here's something to play with in the meantime. I'm curious to see whether the mechanism I used for partial closes works for you guys. The EA will open 2 trades of half the lot size if you choose to have CloseOnBreakEven on. This will close one trade at the violation of the daily high or low. It keeps track of the extra order by using a phony limit on the trade of 9900. It worked for me. If you're on a 4 digit broker and are getting errors you may have to change this variable. If anyone knows a better way of implementing this, please share.

Hi all correct me if I'm wrong from my understanding, the strategy can be summarized as below: BUY 1. Daily chart must be uptrend (20/3,10/5 or 5/3) 2. Entry point whenever M15 chart gives second consecutive BUY signal (cross of ma (20/9,10/5 or 5/3) 3. Enter with 2 units 4.Stop loss will be the valley of the ma cross EXIT 2 options Option 1 1.Unit 1 TP=SL 2.Unit 2=open TP,let the tiger running,exit whenever there is a signal changes on daily chart Option 2 1.Unit 1 exit whenever the lowest of the daily chart violated and 2.Unit 2 exit at the changes of the daily trend The same concept applies for SELL

Hi Guys, I have finally gotten around to testing Brigdier's EA on some of my long term data. I started with EURUSD because I always do in these situations.... I do note that supercat has already found this to be less profitable than some of the cross pairs which tend to trend for longer periods. Attached are two sets of results both using 3ema and 5ema cross on daily bars (for trend) and 15min for entry. After running the first scenario it was clear to me (comparing the equity curve to balance curve) that the exists were too sloppy and that all those precious pips were escaping. Hence the second scenario in which I added a "trailing stop" where the stop loss is modified to be the low/high of the previous day. I believe the next refinement could be to get rid of some of the sloppy entries, you can see from the attached chart that the EA makes many loosing entries in each set.... maybe we should limit the next entry until the previous one is in profit... or something like that; just ideas. Anyway, I'll try to find a pair in my data that has longer trends and see if we can get some better results.

Hi Lion King, did you make this user name especially for this thread.... if so well done. I think you have mostly got it right.... I believe that most recently people have been discussing use of the 5/3 ema. and setting the initial SL to the low/high of the previous day. Most if not all here consider that the strategy is still in testing. but you can be the judge of that. Cheers and good luck on your pip hunt. Carlitodog.

Has anyone tried the EA on pairs that have the add on's for the currency pairs such as EURUSDif, the letters after the pair. I added it on a demo and it worked fine, then I tried putting it on another demo that had the letters after the pair and it didn't do nothing. It's with ILQ broker. Had it running on that broker all day and did nothing.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi there coolyman, I think the most likely problem is that the broker might not accept a pending and market order at the same time. I have this problem with my broker on my live account. The way that the EA is currently programmed it tries to place the market order (buy/sell at market) and apply stop loss and take profit pending orders at the same time. The work around for this is to do these things as two separate steps. No problem, just a little more code. Brigdier - if you want help with this then let me know. Cheers Carlitodog

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I don't know anything about the code for these things but I couldn't figure it out as to why it wouldn't trade when it did so well on the other accounts I had it on. Any help with this would be great Thanks

Carlitodog: For some reason my tester is not working (taking trades).. I used the same data source.. would you be interested in running a couple of iterations with the following parameters..for eurusd, when you have free time maybe on 1 year data. I would greatly appreciate that. Daily trend of 2 and 5, 15 min entries in 3 and 5 with SL OPTION 0. Seperator1="************EMA Settings************"; ShortEMA=2; LongEMA=5; FastShortEMA=3; FastLongEMA=5; PeriodShort=15; PeriodLong=1440; Type=1; Seperator2="************Lot Management************"; Lots=0.02; Slippage=3; MinimumMargin=0.8; Seperator3="************Stop Loss************"; StopLossType=0; Padding=0; StopLossPeriod=15; MaxStopLoss=200; HardStopLoss=200; Seperator4="*************Partial Trades*****************"; CloseHalfAtBreakEven=true; Seperator5="Only place trades outside of a range"; RangeUp=100; RangeDown=100; Daily trend of 2 and 5, 15 min entries in 3 and 5 with SL OPTION 1. Seperator1="************EMA Settings************"; ShortEMA=2; LongEMA=5; FastShortEMA=3; FastLongEMA=5; PeriodShort=15; PeriodLong=1440; Type=1; Seperator2="************Lot Management************"; Lots=0.02; Slippage=3; MinimumMargin=0.8; Seperator3="************Stop Loss************"; StopLossType=1; Padding=200; StopLossPeriod=15; MaxStopLoss=200; HardStopLoss=200; Seperator4="*************Partial Trades*****************"; CloseHalfAtBreakEven=true; Seperator5="Only place trades outside of a range"; RangeUp=100; RangeDown=100; I personally do think that "Initial SL" with daily high/low will be too high a loss. but,... does the trailing stop you added exit on the daily high/low violation? Thanks, Manny

Ya, if anyone wants to help with the EA feel free. Just please keep the code clean and legible for the rest of us. If you guys are having individual issues with the EA, you can send me a private message and we can work that out individually so this thread doesn't turn into tech support. supercat, I'll try to figure out what is causing the flurry of orders. I haven't seen that before. In the meantime, everyone should try backtesting new ideas by hand. If the results look promising, and not just over the pristine trending market conditions of the past 2 months, I'll gladly try to incorporate it into the EA for more rigorous long term backtesting.

Analyze the weekly chart and check to see the signals based on 1/5 ema cross (closed/start on the following candle): use kolier ema to enter trades at every 2-3 ema cross on the corresponding 15 min chart in the main direction as specified by weekly chart. on the 15 min chart... kolier ema parameters: trade at bar open-true max open orders(buy and sell):&gt;400 stop losses: 30 (eurjpy, gbpjpy, eurusd etc.), 70 (eurnzd, gbpnzd etc.) take profit:0 on the weekly chart.. breakeven v2 parameters: lockinpips at-SL lockinpips-0 trades-2 modify trades-true

less than a week old!!

money management: 1/2 lot is closed when it reaches tp=sl and simultaneously sl is moved to zero...so now, the trade is free. the winning strategy is to keep your trades running till the weekly chart suggests you to do otherwise. good luck. also, looking into/studying gbpaud...as the trend is steep all over the weekly chart.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
a fine example: gbpjpy- a strong upward movement of 1300 pips.. this is what you would've gained if you had 1 trade at the very beginning..NOW imagine if you had 20-30 trades in this trend. you would have netted AT LEAST 10,000+ pips...and all of them "free" trades. Again, patience if the key...14 weeks in the market.. riding the trend...mmhh??

--- 帖子 #293 ---
12-14,000 pips (in 2 weeks) also, as the arrows on the weekly chart develop =stop trading!!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
end of 2nd week of trading results: +20,000 pips

come next week...start shorting the EURJPY.. - based on the weekly chart signal.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
also..bear in mind as you are progressing...try to replenish the balance, by closing a few trades.. ..(because equity can disappear like vapor) to compensate for all of our random unsuccessful entries..

Hi Manoj, Has this system modified over time? if yes can you pls post the modified rules and templates, seems a good system, minimizing losses and let the profit run. gr8.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
4. establish SL as the peaks or valleys associated with the eMA cross. TRADE MANAGEMENT and EXIT: I enter with 2 units (micro/mini/standard..whatever) 1. exit first unit when the lows or highs of the daily candles are violated depending if its uptrend or downtrend 2.exit the second unit when when there is a signal change in the daily chart..i.e. 3/20 ema cross. Can someone reiterate these parts? I'm confused.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
please refer the first post...i have added everything that is needed for you to demo test this system (updated june 2013)

Please let me know your results, if any of you decide to test/try this system.. thanks IN ADVANCE. ALSO, ONE MORE THING...WHEN IN DOUBT..DO NOT TRADE!!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Can you please in one sentence tell me how the system works, cos I'm really interested i the system, and which of the EA to download. Thanks for your Quickest response.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
download : 2 eas (experts folder), 1 indicator (experts/indy folder) and then....load the 2 templates(templates folder) in your mt4. now. ....put the respective templates into the charts. voila!! the system is ready to trade!! now, please go to the first post.. and adjust the settings according to the pair you want to trade... and get familiarized with the manual exit once the trend is dead. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I had to close my trades ... 24,000 pips...in 2+ weeks (5/28 TO 06/11) because...eurnzd and gbpnzd were trending like crazy!! AND........... for such a short period of time, no one can predict the validity of this method!!! I WILL come back and will test this for a longer period of time, maybe for a 3-6 month period.. and maybe even try a sensitive analysis...(forward testing only) Please feel free to try this system on a demo, post your results here.. I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, Manny p.s: the most attractive aspect of this method is the LOW DRAWDOWN..now for 100,000 papermoney, its 0.69%, which means, for an account thats 10,000 papermoney, its JUST 6.9%...ya see??

--- 帖子 #310 ---
hey super cat. thank you and this system is good. i am just having a problem setting up the auto trading part of it. the .tpl file does not show up in the template file. and the EMA is showing up small and behind the bars. i dont know if i am doing this right. could you walk me thru the setup of this system? i am new to the mt4 platform. or maybe there is a forum for it. thank you again for this! i'll post pictures after its setup correctly. thank you!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hey Manny, After going through hundred of threads, i found your Tiger Trending with EA appeals to me most in terms of your settings being published in the first post and your long term trending objective which i could totally relate. i've read the millipede thread by pipeasy couple of times, but couldnt fully understand.. i've also gone thru countless of strategies on FF and eventually came out with what i'm trading manually with MACD settings (2,1000,1000). The settings are for long term trending strategy which is making some profit, but its very tiring to stay up monitoring the charts. Ideally EA would definitely be the way to go going forward.. i've been lurking in FF searching for countless EA, unfortunately i couldnt find a suitable EA.. i've uploaded both templates &amp; EAs and the ribbon indi as per your instructions on the weekly &amp; 15m charts for each pair... waiting for the robot to start its job.. haha.. i'll be following your thread closely on any updates and hope to learn more from you.. thank god and thank you for sharing your strategy and i can tell you're very passionate in it, sticking to this strategy for more than a year.. Have fun in beijing for ur kick boxing camp... Cheers mate! ahbeng

--- 帖子 #312 ---
To be honest, the drawdown was probably bigger, as this only counts the closed P/L. Correct me if I'm wrong, but in order to achieve such spectacular results, you enter multiple positions that sometimes overlap their "safety" area. In other words, during a price retracement it is possible for multiple positions to go negative. While the risk is still limited, it does add up to the real drawdown. Of course, doing so improves the hit rate noticeably and the results are so much better.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
hey all can someone using the kolier EA help me? it says in post one that "1. TURN ON THE KOLIER EA, IN THE DIRECTION SUGGESTED BY THE WEEKLY CHART ARROW" how do you go about setting the EA in the direction of the weekly chart arrow? any advice would be much appreciated

--- 帖子 #314 ---
If you get "BUY ARROW" on weekly chart, set your 15 min chart EA for "Only Long" and if you get "SELL ARROW" on weekly chart set your 15 min charts EA for "Only Short"

--- 帖子 #315 ---
ah of course, thank you so much pundit78! going to test drive this system now....

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I think.. Its possible..MAYBE..it reflects the CLOSED P/L. shrinking down the losses during the retracements (within a weekly candle).. I think I found a way... if an arrow appears in the opposite direction of the weekly candle..PAUSE THE EA till that arrow disappears!! :::dO NOT TRADE ON A WEEKLY CANDLE WHEN IT HAS AN ARROW OVER/UNDER IT:::: I just want to keep it as simple as possible by just sticking to the basics.. everything else is totally RANDOM!!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
MT4 is relatively easy to navigate..its super-user-friendly.. I am sure you will get a grip of this platform in a couple of days...good luck!!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thanks my friend.. Although, millipede thread is branched out into too many directions, lately...I think the initial part is extremely valuable.. I loved every bit of pipeasy's philosophies and techniques.. please dont forget to share your results here..

--- 帖子 #319 ---
hey supercat thanks for the latest tips, please keep us informed if you have any other valuable snippets of information which we would be able to use. started a £10,000 demo today, took a ~£350 sl hit/s on AUDUSD shorts, weekly trend was down but there is a clear weekly upbar. so far though i am trying the system strictly with the rules as laid out in post#1, not adding any personal judgements/ amendments. will eventually close off positive trades if i feel the balance is dropping too far, as laid out in post 1. thanks for the system and EA's again supercat, im getting the feeling that higher timeframe trading is the way to go, so pretty positive at this point for this system coupled with your great results. blam

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Blam: sometimes, you could have multiple back to back losses for weeks..but, thats ok... the reason why this system is so powerful is because the gains are pyramiding while the losses are linear.... meaning, the winners.... when you add up has a snowball/snowballing effect..your balance would be in positive at the end of each year...year after year.. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #322 ---
AND on top of it.. we are using money management..with 1/2 lot closing w/ profit while the other 1/2 is put to BE.. wink..wink.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I have another suggestion for you, based on the last chart posted. See the attachment. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note the area in the blue rectangle. Any trades opened there would basically end up as losses. If you didn't enter a single trade there, your result would still be about the same, if not better. Something that the author of the millipede thread stressed on was to avoid "trying too hard to get a leg". Have you thought about shutting down the new trade entries as a completely different trigger? Like, say, you enable trading on a 5/10 cross, exit on the opposite cross, but stop adding on a 3/5 cross in the opposite direction? The numbers are just for example, you could use something different. The idea is to avoid adding positions near the end of the move, while leaving the early entries grow to their potential.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
1. my trading/techinique is TOTALLY REACTIVE...as opposed to predictive trading (candlestick, patterns, supply-demand etc.), hence, at-most might be suspicious of that area within the rectangle as a NO-TRADE ZONE...but would not be sure of it. 2. I think your idea of using multiple crosses (EMA fan) would definitely help in terms of minimizing the losses/pausing the trades early....I can totally see 2/3 within 2/5 in the weekly, helping us reduce the losses to a great deal.. I think we could try it..

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Supercat. Glad to see your thread back. I've been a longtime fan of Graeme's methods but haven't yet hit on the right combination to make a go of it. Will definitely try this out with the ea's. I like Barbossa's idea of discontinue trading as the trend slows down. My experience in longer term MA cross strategies definitely have suffered from the losses at the turns. I'll definitely try implementing that. What is your current list of pairs your trading. Same as before or have you modified.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
spyderman.. the ones that are trending + moving fast. for me..I like.. like eurnzd, gbpnzd, audjpy, eurjpy, gbpjpy, gbpaud etc. Now, you could trade any pairs...as you like.. just that the weekly chart should be clean with long trends and minimal up/down arrows in between.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Inserted Video This is how the MARKET messes w/ your head!!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Another thought I had to filter out trades as the trend may be changing is to only take trades if the current weekly candle matches the current trend direction. So if we're in an uptrend on the weekly, but the current weekly bar is down, then no trades. That bar may be a retracement or an actual trend change, but either way, we'd be on the sidelines until it resumes in our direction or we get an actual ema crossover.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Thanks for this system. Looks promising I have a question: TRADE MANAGEMENT: 1. ENTER (AUTOMATED) 2 LOTS (MICRO/MINI/STANDARD) Using the EA with the mentioned settings it opens just one order 0.1 lot. (maybe I do something wrong) Also when looking at your statement I see it opens most of time one order and sometimes 2 orders? 2. EXIT ONE LOT (AUTOMATED) WHEN TP=SL, AND LET THE OTHER LOT(NOW, THIS SL IS MOVED TO ENTRY PRICE) RUN TO THE MOON. Because point one is not working at the moment (for me) point 2 isnt working either. But If I understand correctly it should work as follow. Every time a new arrow occurs (in position of the trend) the Ea should open 2 orders. One of these orders closed when locked pips are the new SL? The other one just let run and close manually at a certain level? Please can you explain to me? Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Just started using the EA yesterday xin, but it's working for me. You have to stipulate the lot size in the EA. The default is .1 but you can set it to whatever you want. If you set it to .6 (as an example) when the TP is hit (30 or 70) it will close half and leave the balance (.3 in this case) at break even. You will of course want to adjust the initial position size according to your account type, broker parameters and risk appetite

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Yes...That is the filter I have been using.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I have been trading with 2/3 ema on the weekly chart ...this time around.. it might mean early exit (read: not realizing the full potential of the trend).. but, this is something I love to do..try different combinations.. I am sure, you would be successful in any combination...as long as you stick to the trading rules.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I've set up this system on demo, since I also liked Graeme's original thread. I turned on the trading EA and it's started trading. I feel the way it is now is logical. I'm just wondering how necessary optimization of stop losses on each pair would be? Im using the standard 30 and 70, with take profit on the first portion the same. Or is over-optimizing this not seeing the forest for the trees?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Ya know...so far..70 something, is worked for me for the high-spread pairs like eurnzd, gbpnzd... but for gbpjpy, eurjpy...30 seems like a little too less...because of the number of losses after being BE.. so, I think maybe 40 or so.. I also think..low spread pairs (MAJORS) like eurusd, audusd..maybe 30 or even lesser (I haven't tested those, because I don't trade them) Please let us know how your trading goes, if you try with other Stop losses..we could adapt this system accordingly.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Supercat, EA seems to be trading per specs. I did notice that it continues to take multiple positions on same pair irrespective of whether previous orders are at BE or not. Was wondering what you thought about the advisability of waiting until order A is at BE (with 1/2 closed) before opening position B. It seems Graeme always recommended that. Also on the s/l, t/p, I've always like using some multiply of ATR for that. Seems more customized to each pair. Don't know what you think on that.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Spyderman: I am sure that would minimize the losses..and stop the flurry of aggressive entries..controlled trading so to speak.. I agree with you on that..but, that means the EA needs to be fed w/ some extra codes..and if someone could code that into it...I think that would be awesome.. much more intelligent way of trading. I do think ATR is a great way to decide the SL..what SL's are you using for your pairs? Also, please share your results when your trades mature. Thanks, Manny

--- 帖子 #337 ---
As far as sl's, I'm going with your 30/70 for now. I'm going to tweek to ATR once I get a feel for it. As far as the EA goes, where did you get it originally. Might be best to speak to original coder. I could ask the the guys over at Steve Hopwood's and they would probably make adjustments

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Definitely it would be good to have some control/limit over how many entries are fired off. And the ATR option for stop loss. Since we have the source code it should be possible. Ranging periods on the 15 minute may fire off too many trades. Ideally I would like to stack 1 trade at a time as the trend progresses and adjust stop loss according to the volatility of the pair.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Yeah, just waiting to hear back from Supercat before proceeding. Looks like it might be a commercial EA and don't want to start screwing with somebody's code without permission. I went to the coder's website and he's still operating, so there's another option there.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
yes..we should do it.. we could request Kolier's permission to modify the code so..somebody here could modify the code to.. 1. cherry pick the entries by this EA as you guys mentioned 2. Set % ATR as an optional SL (variable or static..I dont know) Now, this system is evolving into a conservative trading machine..less automated trades..but much more pleasing in my view, when you look at the losses column. Thanks guys for keeping the momentum going and sharing your thoughts and ideas.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I've sent an email to Kolier

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks Spyderman

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Just posting some positive results using .02 lots. (demo still) The BE EA is working and selling half at targets 30 and 70 (15 trades reached first TP and half microlot sold). As you can see the entry EA Kolier is opening up multiple trades very close apart due to ranging period. In this case it is good. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I've noticed the trade management EA acting a little squirrely. Sometimes, after closing half the position and moving to BE, it will then close another half later. And then sometimes the Kolier EA fails to set a s/l at all and then the trade management EA doesn't close half at BE. Anyone else experience this?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Yes having same problem. Ea's are not running stable.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Nice work dude. Thanks for such a wonderful information. Regards.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Awesome. limited low risk entries, holding winners for prolonged growth, and influenced by the legendary Equity Millipede thread. All the ingredients for a successful trading method.
