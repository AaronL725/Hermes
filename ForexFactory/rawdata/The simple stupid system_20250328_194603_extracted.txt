Chart setup: Heikin ashi EMA 5 close EMA 8 open Dinapoli stoch 8-3-3 MomentumVT 10 QQE Alert Smooth Factor 1 There are two conditions for Entry. 1. Basic Entry Buy: 5/8 ma up crossover Dinapoli stoch bullish crossover MomentumVT above 0 level QQE alert pointing up Sell: 5/8 ma down crossover Dinapoli stoch bearish crossover MomentumVT below 0 QQE alert pointing down Update As I have discovered that moving averages often react to price actions rather quickly, I decided to add a filter to my exits. Exit: Whet both QQE alert and 5/8 Ema crossover have signalled an opposite direction, then exit. They don't have to signal at the same time but you no exit must be taken until the two have signalled an exit. 2. Re-Entry Let's say we miss a basic setup and look to entering the trade after the setup as occured, these are the conditions that must be met: Buy: Make sure that all the indicators are going in the buy direction. Allow the dinapoli stoch to go into a sell then enter a buy when it also turns back to the buy direction. Take note of any support or resistance level or any pivot point close to the current price. Enter when the dinapoli stoch crosses over to a buy. Sell: Opposite of buy. Exit: Stop loss of 20 pips, OR Take profit of 20 or 30 pips. Whichever is hit first. I also use a trailing stop of 20 pips. News. I do not open new positions when big news is coming up. If I am already in a trade and a big news is near, I exit the trade if I have profit less than 30 pips. But if I am in a profit of more than 30 pips, I leave 20 pips out and lock in the remaining then trail my stop with a 20 pips trailing stop. That is my own personal way of handling news, other suggestions are welcome. The purpose of this thread is to improve the strategy and also build an expert advisor. You can also add timeframe filters. Wahnone

This is simple but certainly not stupid Thanks Wahnone!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi there, Nice simple looking system , but I couldn't get your QQE alert arrows to appear on my chart . I've got the indicators loaded into my indicators folder, then closed the platform and reopened it, then loaded QQE onto the chart but no arrows appeared. Any ideas what the problem might be Thanks for your system, T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Do you wait for the candle to close before an entry is made when all indicators agree? Where do you place a stop loss?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
That's just the alert. You have to have a QQE indicator in your indicator file. I have a dozen in mine and I don't know which one it uses. Otherwise I would post it.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Try this one.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
What currency pairs and time frames do you use?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Bill, Hope you're doing well. Thanks very much for posting that indicator. I've got a few of them saved in a folder too. I should have caught that the indicator he posted was an alert meant to be used with the QQE indicator itself. See ! That's what happens when I forget to take my smartie pills in the morning Take care of yourself there Bill....T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yes. I do wait for the candle to close before entering but i sometimes use the 5minutes chart for an earlier entry

--- 帖子 #10 ---
great system and thanks for sharing but did you try it for live trading and how long ..... ))) just asking

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I trade the 15 min gbpusd and at times the eurjpy. I trade from 5.00 gmt to 19.00gmt

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Do you use SL? Or any idea to have SL on this system?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I occasionally use parabolic sar as a trailing stop to prevent spikes going against me.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I have changed the ma cross alert to show 5 close and 8 open. Mart

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Here are two trades taken today on gbpusd 15 min

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Do you use the QQE? If yes how? Thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi guys, i am new here and i fell over this thread, please can somebody tell me how to put in those files into the mt4, i am not so familiar with this platform. thanks in advance tickticker

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I use the qqe as a trigger to enter a trade but i am looking to add a better trigger as qqe often enters late and gets me into more trades.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hello Wahnone, was reading your thread here and your system seems to be very interesting, still a lot for me is new in the mt4 platform, i have a little clue how to put the Files into the platform but not exactly in which folders they shall be, i downloaded your system already and in my case the icons from DiNapoli, Hekhin-Ashi, Momentum and QQE Alert are not such yellow rombuses like in the metarader, does this matter (i am not a programmer). So maybe you could give me a hint how and where to do it. Thanks, tickticker

--- 帖子 #20 ---
The files i uploaded are in ex.4 extension .The file you are referring to is mql.4. Its compressed form is the ex4. You just need to extract the indicators (the ones posted) to your indicators folder : Program files &gt; metatrader &gt; experts &gt; indicators. Also extract the template to your templates directory : Program files &gt; metatrader &gt; templates. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Thank you for sharing your system. I trust that you will be well-rewarded by suggestions that people have on how to improve your approach. I am looking forward to trying it out. Here are some questions I have for you: Over the time you've been trading it live, how has your win/loss ratio been? And how long have your been trading it? Since you are able to trade the 15M TF and during the hours you mention, you must be trade full time, right? Do you think it will work on higher time frames such as 1H, 4H and Daily. I started to look at 1H historical results and it seems to work pretty well there. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #22 ---

First was around +40 pips and second was around +20 pips. Both on gbpusd 15min.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I just started trading the system a couple of weeks ago so i havent yet determined its profit to loss ratio and besides i only do it on demo for now but will soon start it on live account. I trade fuul time but stop when i feel okay. You can do some backtesting to see if it will work on other timeframes as i havent tested it on any other time frame besides 15min.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The qqe is a very fine indicator but its not a must for me. The main indicators are the moving averages and the momentum indicator. I would take a look at the indicators you posted. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
One thing i don't do is trade against a barrier such as the pivot points and the 200 moving average. These two could be adapted as filters. But i dont want to make this system anymore complicated so these additions are not soooo important, they are only meant as guides. I trade only gbpusd 15min and sometime usdjpy also on 15min as i dont like too much noise and at the same time i dont like staying too long on a trade. GBPUSD is the best for this strategy so far and i am not planning to add any more pairs as it would be confusing at times moving from one pair to another. Also when the market is ranging or sleeping ( like right now ), i don't like to trade as it would entail staying long to take only a small profit. I recognise a ranging and sideways market by my instinct but this sometimes affects my trading as i could also filter out some good trades. These are just a few additions which i added to this system.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I started trading your system live today and it did very well indeed for me! Following your entry rules I backtested (although I don't usually do that as I find backtesting unreliable) for the last 8 days it had 18 winners and 5 losers. Not too shabby indeed! Popping 3 lots per trade and I exit after 30 pips with a S/L of 20 pips (on good trending days, otherwise my TP will be only 20. I trade the G/U ONLY between 2:30est and 6:30est. I got off Heiken Ashi candles awhile back. Now I'm back to em. And actually, trading the strategy as is, one can almost elminate the candles competely and just trade the crosses. Presently I'm looking at using a 34MA as a barrier. With a 15M chart and my TP goal the 200MA is not relevant to any trades. And I'll watch the trade as it nears a S/R level, but too many times the trades will spike right past them. Price is ALWAYS going to do what price wants to do, regardless of S/R, Fibs, or any indicator. Kudos on a nice clean and simple strategy!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
How did your trades live out yesterday? mine were okay with around 60 pips in profit toltally as i avoid news periods. Also, which timeframe did you trade this with? Wahnone

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I am looking to add the gann hilo activator to act as filter to the moving averages and possibly use it as the exit trigger. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I'ma happy camper from yesterday. Popped my 30 pips w/ 3 lots and I trade the 15M tf only. Even after trading 5 years I don't possess the patience to handle longer tf trades, but then I am at the computer full time, so the shorter tf's work well for me and my personality. I'm using the 5 8 EMA Crossover alert from your thread that Mart-hart posted and it works well enuff for me. I've used the Gann Hilo Activator in the past. No complaints with it, it's just not my cup of tea. For my trading style it just doesn't work for me to sit and ride trades out for any indicator to tell me when to exit. I've seen too many profits get eaten away once I had them. Like Felicia (The Cornflower Creator) says, quit the day even if you have just 1 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
The ma's are pretty good on there but i just found that we could add the gann hilo to filter out some ranging or flat market. But if we follow the rules and trade only during volatile market periods, then we would get less false signals.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Wahnone Looking at your chart in post #23, your first trade is a Sell at 09:30. My question is, why did you not make a BUY trade at 09:00 ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Wahnone, Thanks for posting your trading strategy here at FF. I see where you are coming from on using the other indicators to help filter out more of the losing trades and getting you into more winners. They may help, since most MA crossover systems are known for whipping you to death during ranging markets. Trading a higher timeframe like 1h or 4h may help even more. Wishing you good fortune. Dave

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I would have entered it and exited at a very small loss of probably 5 to 10 pips because i do use a stop loss of 20 and a trailing stop of 20. I didn't enter the trade at all because i had not yet started my trading session by that time.

Hello Wanhone, Could you post this parabolic sar? have no idea how this works but would like to try it. greetings, tickticker Originally Posted by Kire http://www.forexfactory.com/images/buttons/viewpost.gif Do you use SL?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
The parabolic sar is a standard indicator that comes with the MT4 platform in the indicators folder. It moves closer to price on the chart as time goes by and eventually converges with it. It then moves to the other side of price at some point indicating that the price momentum has stopped or is swinging back the opposite direction: The red dots are the psar.

Thanks Dave, i think i´ve got the picture, the sar runs so to say only on the chart, it is not a system as i thought, maybe like a kind of a flexible stoploss. i already checked it on the charts but didnt know what to think about before i got your explanation. Correct me please if ia m wrong, that means when the sar converges or crosses the price, price reached it´s momentally high and it´s to think about to lock in some profit or close the position complete? thanks, tick

Hi Guys, here i uploaded one Chart from Wahnone and one of mine, Please can somebody tell me, This yellow number 0.50 in Wahnone´s 15 min Chart, shows in my 1 and 4 hour Chart 0.52 , on smaller TF´s i cannot see it. Do i have to change that? I think so. How can i change that? Why can´t i see it on my 30 or 15 min TF? And what purpose does it have? Thanks Guys for answering. greetings tick

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Guys, to my latest questions i have to say, yes i can see this yellow number on smaller TF´s but it is somewhere in the middle of the Chart when i´m scrolling backward, but still it shows 0.52 not 0.50 like on Wahnone´s. thanks, tick

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Wahnone: I noticed on your charts you're showing regular candles now. Are you not using the Heiken Ashi candles anymore?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Morning to all. This monday morning as been a very good one for the gbpusd as you can all see. The yellow number is the ej_candle time indicator which shows how much time is left for a candle to close in minutes. I have attached it below.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I am a very emotional per son and that was why i decided to put in the heikin ashi so that it will wipe out the original candles ups and downs and therefore give me a smothened look at the price. The heikin ashi is not so paramount in this system.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
If the wicks get you rattled when you trade you MIGHT want to try the Heiken Ashi Smooth. They're not as 'jumpy'. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed.mq4 4 KB | 762 downloads

Thanks. How as your trading been today?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
i thought it could have something to do with the 50 Momentumlevel, but was almost sure that it´s not, but you know.... there is much to learn and till now i made enough mistakes so i try to avoid as much as possible, still will be enough and so i ask sometimes maybe one unnecesarry question. greetings, tick btw. how you guys are doint that, when you reply a post, that you insert the original message? sorry

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Tick, You're right. Here's a more detailed explanation of the psar and how it works: The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) is a system of defining the point of trend's turns; The Parabolic SAR (PSAR) indicator is based on the link between a Forex market's price and time. The basic goals of the Parabolic System is to make reverse orientation of trading positions when the ongoing trend turns. The indicator is called like that due to the fact that when charted, the pattern resembles a parabola or French curve. The Parabolic SAR system should be used only when the market has the defined trend. When the trend is absent this system generates a lot of incorrect signals. Parabolic SAR is base on the following rule: to shift the levels of closing prices only in direction of opened position. If there is a long position opened before, it is possible to increase the level of closing prices, but not to decrease it. If the short position is opened, it is possible to decrease the level of closing prices. In other words, it is an indicator that trails the price as it moves in the direction it started after price crosses the psar. It starts out at a certain distance away from price and moves gradually closer to the price over time, but never farther away from it so eventually it will converge with price. At that point you will see the first psar dot form on the other side of the first closed bar after convergence and it will start the same process on the other side of price. Notice from the attached pic that the psar is very helpful in the case where price is making a strong move in one direction (triangle) but will just give a lot of false signals in a flat or choppy market (oval). I hope this helps you profit from your trading, PistolDave

Got in about 10:00pm est last night. Rode the G/U for a little over 100 pips. At my 3 lots that's a dang nice profit for today. I usually exit with 30 pips profit but it just kept dropping on me so I stayed in. Normally I would not have entered a trade on Asian market, but Sunday eve -Monday early it can move like a son-of-a gun, particularly after a holiday! The MA's had nice seperation and angle and stayed away from the Gann HiLo Activator. No reason to panic and and pull out. Classic example of riding a winner! Saw it coming so decided to TRADE THE PLAN!

Now i am sitting on my PC without a quick heartbeat and try to do this what i learn from all those guys out there who really are happy when they can help and use a huge part of my time to educate myself, because one thing i heard or read now over and over and this is: dont take any trade, wait till the trade what fit´s you, comes to you, and so i am getting slowly ground under my feet and the best thing is, i know why, because i am not running around like a cowboy and shoot on everthing that moves, i wait, and while i wait i am reading and try to absorb as much positive as possible. Profits are small but i am feeling good and to be honest it is because of guys like you here, defenitly i must say i was this whole last year in wrong company and i knew it but could not find a way out, was too busy with loosing money. I don´t wanna write a book here but thank you guys, you give me a good feeling. tick

--- 帖子 #53 ---
That was a valid trade. I also took it. Let's hope it lives out.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Bagged-in about +150 pips on the first trade and about +100 on the second trade. I exited the second trade because i kwon the market will soon go asleep and also because my trading session for the day is about to end. Hope you guys also had a good pippin' day.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Nicely done. Which indicator is that for your pivot, support &amp; resistance your using on your chart?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The indicator is the fibonacci pivot indicator. It is attached below. Anyone else did those moves?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
[quote=Wahnone;2095412 Anyone else did those moves?[/quote] Check post #48! Like your colored boxes on your charts showing the different markets open and closing. Can you attached this to a post? I like it!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Wahnone, Is it the stochastic or the momentum above or below 50? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Wahnone's catching some Zzzz's. The answer to your question is the Momentum has to be above 50 for long. Stoch just has to be heading up from the bottom (bullish sign). Opposite for short.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I like the system, it´s a great help in identifying the direction, which price will head with a high probability. The Art is to identify the real movers and in my eyes that´s really an Art and in that it looks like i am not the succesfullest. The criterias for long and short are easy. Wahnon himself says he is not trading against barriers. So in this case one should not take the actual trade now because it will go against the pivot level from this fibonacci pivots indicator which wahnone posted yesterday, (many thanks for that, it appears a lil different like my auto pivots still didnt figure out why what differs). My qustion now is, what do i not see? I took the trade before, i took it a lil late cause was hesitating after it brohe the pivot level but then i took it and got out with a lil loss from around 13 pips or so. Now the actual trade pushes against the pivot level and if it breaks and the next candle is closing underneeth, is it then a good time to go in or is it not recomandable because it is still lurking around the pivot level or because one should take the trade imediately when it appear. I would appreciate very much if you guys would post me your thoughts how you do it under which criterias. thx, tick

--- 帖子 #61 ---
About the price breaking the pivot points, it depends on your personalty. If you can afford to risk going against a barrier like the pivot, then so be it. Personally, i do not trade against any barrier and on this particular trade I also entered after the candle closed above the pivot, and I also had about the same loss as you. It doesn't bother me because i know a better trade will come up at some other time. Note: Losing is part of the game. Just be assured that the good trades will outpip the bad ones. Good hunting.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Yes Wahnone, i am with you, till now i am happy with my profit/loss ratio, I am just asking myself how can i eliminate as much as possible from the losing trades or even avoid those trades which are going suddenly in a range and sometimes i write down my thoughts, like last post, i installed this fibonacci pivot which you posted just a few hours ago and i cannot scroll back and see much from former trades, how the trades around those levels were reacting but in the little history i can see, it appears me that when the market goes to a sup/res or the fibo level and bounces off and after that comes the trade, theese trades seem to be the bigger movers, as i said i have no history about that. The Ranging problem and whipsawing to dead can be eliminated when trading in the right daytime and of course not trading in ranging markets, whell if the range is big enough it´s quiet nice and easy to trade with this system. greetings, tick

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I had a look at the usdjpy this morning and when a setup came on it, i took it and it is currently around +50 pips. I also entered the gbpusd at 9:00 GMT and it is also currently around +50 pips. Will post my charts at the end of the day. Good Hunting.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I have forward tested the system with SL30 &amp; TP300 on GU M15, here are the results.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
According to your forward testing rules, the stop loss is relatively too tight for such wide take profit. Would be nice if you could come with an ea that would take the trades exactly according to the rules in post 1. I have no idea of programming but if you could come up with an ea, it would be nice as we would be able to test the system more effectively.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
[quote=tickticker;2096897 I would appreciate very much if you guys would post me your thoughts how you do it under which criterias. thx, tick[/quote] I'll be happy to answer some of your questions based on my experience and trading style, but I don't want to take up room here and get away from specific postings that discusses the Simple Stupid System.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Please check it - there might be some bugs. The EA checks the conditions per post #1 and places an order on the next candle opening (instead of the candle close) I tested on GU M15 May 2007 through Jan 2008 and can't get good results. This system may be good when the currency is trending ??? What I don't know is how to exit ;;; right now EA exits when the opposite cross happens (check closeemadiff) or the SL is hit Please test it guys and lets see if we can make it work. ps. Wahnone please post your char for today as you promised m78 here's what you need to read //The simple stupid system EA //http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=94006 //Version 1.00 alfa //you have to have MomentumVT.ex4 and "Dinapoli stoch".ex4 in your experts/indicators directory //magic number so you can run more than one of this EMA on the same currency extern int MagicNumber = 0; //how many lots to buy/sell extern double Lots = 1; //slippage for completing orders extern int Slippage = 5; //for long trade - we'll enter when stoch main - stoch signal &gt; stochdifflevel //for short trade - we'll enter when stoch main - stoch signal &lt; -stochdifflevel extern double stochdifflevel = 10; //for long trade - we'll enter when momentum &gt; momlevel //for short trade - we'll enter when momentum &lt; -momlevel extern int momlevel = 9; //we'll enter when ema cross happens and abs(ema5 - ema8) &gt;= buyemadiff extern double buyemadiff = 5; //we'll close when ema cross happens and abs(ema5 - ema8) &gt;= closeemadiff extern double closeemadiff = 2; //maximum stop loss per trade extern int StopLoss = 50; //leave this 0 if you want the EA to close the trade by itself extern int TakeProfit = 0; //this is the difference to GMT of your broker's server time //eg: Alpari is GMT+02 so should be gmt_plus_x = 2; for OLD - GMT+00 gmt_plus_x = 0 extern int gmt_plus_x = 0;

Two trades taken on july 8. First trade extited at around -10 pips and second trade exited at around +75 pips. I entered the first trade late because i was waiting for the price to break the pivot before i get in. The aggregate no. of pips was around +65 pips.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thanks a lot for the good work. The EA is perfectly okay apart from a few little bit late entries. You said that you tested this system on the cable from may 2007 to january 2008 and didn't get good results, it might be because the testing included times when the market wasn't volatile or it could be that the cable had changed its personalty over the last few months. According to manual backtesting result, the system is quite profitable. Back to the ea, could you make it to have time settings so that we would be able to set the time between the day that we want to backtest(e.g from 6:00 GMT to 18:00 GMT) because that is the only period that this system can be truly productive. Thanks for the work once more. Good Hunting.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Can you post the attachment that shows the different colored boxes showing which markets are open? That is a great informative tool to have on the charts! Thanx in advance!

You set the time according to your broker time.

I traded the usdjpy yesterday and got some good results, bagging in about +100 pips altogether. Below is an attached screenshot.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I have a few additional i base all my intraday strategies upon including the simple stupid system. Here are the rules: 1. Try as much as possible to avoid news time. Personally, i do not open a new position when a big news is coming up. If i have a trade on, i either pick it or lock in some of my profits if they are substantial. 2. If the setup is just coming up, i don't count too much on the pivots if price are still a bit far from it. This will rwduce having to wait until price breaks the pivot. Thanks to m78 for the expert advisor. Although it takes off the trades quite well, it has a few lapses. For instance, i just finished backtesting the system for last week, it took off some trades well while at some point or the other, some trades were not taken or exited rather too late or too early.Also, it can't take into consideration the above rules when it is being backtested. I would appreciate more effort on perfecting this ea, but for now i would suggest that you backtest this system manually. Thanks to m78 once again. I will post my charts for today very soon. Watchout. Good Hunting.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Had two trades today. First one was a loss of about 5pips, second was a profit of around +110 pips. Exited second trade because my trading session has ended. Hope you also had a nice day with this system. Attached below is the screenshot. Good Hunting.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi, actually you can tweak the ea with the settings ... Click on expert advisor options or modify the mq4 source code file I think these are the rules that you normally use ... extern double stochdifflevel = 0; extern int momlevel = 0; extern double buyemadiff = 1.5; extern double closeemadiff = 1; Also do you pay attention how many candles ago the stochastic cross happened when you place your trades ? m78

I do not pay attention to how many candles ago the stochastic crossed, just make sure it corresponds with all other indicators. I do not think you included the qqe alert as part of the entry parameters for the EA. Please refer to post 1 for the updated rules of this system. Thanks for your help. Good Hunting.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
You're right. the QQE alert simply doesn't draw any arrows for me ... so I have no way of making it work. Do you happen to have an mq4 of that QQE Alert indicator ? m78

--- 帖子 #78 ---
If this isn't what you need let me know. I think I have one that's not Multi-frame.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Here's one that may be better.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hopefully one of em will be what you need.

Any luck with adding the qqe addition to the ea?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi guys. I was off the internet for some days due to some connection problems but all is settled now and i think it's time to continue piping the gbpusd again. Any help with the ea?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
so you didn't trade last week ? anyways I found out the QQE Alert v3 needs the QQEA.ex4 or QQEA.mq4 for it to work; can you post these ? The best ones would be *.mq4 ones m78

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Here is the QQEA.ex4. I could not find the mq4 version, and by the way, i didn't trade last week but only got back online to see what i have missed out. How was the week for you?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
attached...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
changes: * trading is done from candle 4 and ends on candle 19 of your metatrader (so if you have ODL which has GMT time then it's 4am GMT and 7pm GMT) you can modify that in expert settings of the EA * in order to enter the trade the QQEA Alert has to be for long/short up to default value of 15 candles ago ... you can change that in the EA * the open trade will close if the QQEA Alert makes an opposite signal OR as it was before on the ema cross * the default values for ema difference / stochastic difference and momentum difference have been decreased to minimum values ps. Wahnone please post your manual trading charts

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks m78 for your effort on the ea. Would soon post my manual charts in the soonest time. Would soon check the exper4t advisor also.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
can any one post the result for 18-7-2008 Thanks

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Thank you once again for the ea. It seems I have not yet gotten the settings. What are the settins you feel are best so as to march the rules of this as I noticed after backtesting the ea that it seems to close a trade almost immediately after it has opened it. Waiting for your reply.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
ok, there was a bug ... and I just found another bug;;; I guess there might be some more bugs there ... if you notice a problem can you post the screenshot of the trades the EA took ? also post the modifications to the default settings of the EA if you make the mods m78

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Guys, I like this simple system and thanks to Wahnone. I have a problem finding the 50 level in the MomentumVT indicator but there is a 0 level in the middle of the indicator. Could there be a typo error in the entry rule or the 50 level is referring to the Dinapoli Stoch? Any clarification is appreciated. 1. Basic Entry Buy: 5/8 ma up crossover Dinapoli stoch bullish crossover MomentumVT above 50 level QQE alert pointing up Sell: 5/8 ma down crossover Dinapoli stoch bearish crossover MomentumVT below 50 QQE alert pointing down

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Harry, I think you are right. I have mine set at 0 as a level. If you look closely at his charts in post 1, you will see that it is the same. I think maybe he just ment going past the half way point (50%).

--- 帖子 #93 ---
anyone forward testing this system? How have the results been?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Bagged in a total of around +110 pips.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Here is a trade taken today by the former ea on gbpjpy 15 mins. The entry was perfect but it exited on the same bar. But with the new ea, i think that is settled.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
You are right. That was a typo error. Would correct it right away.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thank you very much for your effort on the ea. I think it is alright now and all that is left is to tweak the settings for optimal result. Your effort is highly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Is any one having luck with the ea settings, please share with us if you are. I am also presently tweaking different settings.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Whanone, Thanks for this simple method. I am using it to enhance my scalping method on the eurusd and it is getting me more pips.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
About 130 pips

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Please what does the ' qqea_alert_x_candles_ago' and the 'stochdifflevel' mean in the expert advisor.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I think the EA still has some mistakes. The most common one is that it doesn't exit the trade according to the rules on post 1. The rule for exit is that until both the QQE and the MA's change direction, there should be no exit. But I have found that the ea exits the trade at the first signal of any of the two i.e it exits the trade immediately after the QQE changes or the moving averages cross. Below is a sample trade taken by the EA while backtesting it. The purpose of waiting for both to change over before exiting are 1: To avoid whipsaws which arise from using the moving averages to exit as it is known that MA's are prone to being whipsawed when the market is either rangebound or flat. The QQE would help filter out some of this whipsaws. 2: The QQE also has some of its own bad sides that the moving averages filter out. For instance, the QQE comes up when the momentum begins to fall in a trending situation, but the MA's prevent us from going out of the trend before its actual end. Please, anyone with programming skills who can help correct this mistake will be much appreciated. I think if that is done, then the EA is through to go. M78, you are the author of this EA and your efforts are highly appreciated but please see into this issue and correct this mistake so as to make the testing of this system as accurate as possible. Just adjust the exit so that until both the QQE and the moving averages cross occurs, there will be no exit. Thank U all.

Hello, Sounds great I installed everything but don't see any arrows for the QQE Alert. Thanks, cwave

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Try putting it manually. I think this should do.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Wahnone Thanks so much for sharing the method, it makes sense, pips, cents and dollars too. Have you or any one else on this thread tried this method on a longer time frame like hourly or 4 hourly? Its just that I can't sit and watch screens all day as I am a part time trader and own a business.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I have not yet tested it on the higher timeframes but as soon as the EA is ready, all that will be done. For now, I am concentrating on 15 mins.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Wahnone, I've read your thread it's very interesting, I'm going to try on demo next week but I have a problem I havn't got denapoli stoch mq4 in my chart. Could you( or anyone) please post me denapoli stoch mq4 Thank you, Pete

Hello All, I have read this system from Wahnone from beginning and really interest me. Seems like its good for 15Mins Scalping and the most interesting is the simplicity .... I might try it on my demo account first. Nice system Wahnone. -ATUQUE-

--- 帖子 #112 ---
me too none of the alerts works for me...

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank you Orion Pete

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hello, Wahnone. I like your system and found it is good in EUR/JPY too. What do you think? James

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I checked it on EURJPY and USDJPY 15 mins and it was good on both. Would demo trade on both from now on.

Trades for aug 4... totalling about 60+ pips. What a system!!!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Picked those exact same trades up myself!! thanks for the system

--- 帖子 #118 ---
nice but will this stand the test of time? does it work in any type of market? sideways? uptrend? downtrend?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
seems to be fine in trending up or down. flat market doesn't do so good. find diff strat for sideways market.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hey Chaps Been trying on a 1hour TF, works well but you have to wait it out of a position to happen, your runs are longer which is really cool, a bit frustrating when a cross happens while you are sleeping, I just keep reminding myself that there is aways another trade around the corner if I miss one because I am in dreamland, Whats really great about 1hour TFs is that you dont have to watch charts all day. Happy Trading all, This method is working for me (On 1Hours TF)

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Does the alerter s (QQ..) is really needed?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
It works for me

--- 帖子 #123 ---
You mean you can see it on chart or it helps you on your decisions?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
both

--- 帖子 #125 ---
One mistake we traders make is thinking it is better to trade every move whenever it comes be it at midnight or at noon and that is what i figured out and decided to trade this system at the particular period when the market is at its most volatile. Also, the system has some setbacks when in a sideways or ranging market, but all that is taken care of by a single nice trend movement, so i don't have to worry myself that the market is sideways or ranging. This is my personal opinion anyway. Good hunting.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi man! Nice system. I still dont get the QQE arrows with any indicator here, can someone plz send the most updated one? and about exiting, in some of your trades you exited just when the ma's crossed like the sell exit here with no QQE aroow, how come?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
About the exit, you didn't post any charts to expantiate but i think i understand you. There are some times when the QQE alert shows up long before the MA's cross, and so, that is a valid exit signal. The 2 don't have to happen at the same time. I have attached the QQE alert indicator.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Instead of jumping out of a trade because a big news is coming up, why not use it to your advantage since it will go either to your direction or against it. MY conclusion is that 15min prior to a big news, place a stoploss using the vegas indicator line which is nearest at that time to the current price. This will enable you exit early if the news is against you and also allow you to stay in if it goes in your favour. I have attached a sample scenario that happened on the 31st of July 2008 USDJPY...

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Wahnone i just sent pm. i can't get qqe to work. i know im not the first, lol. the indicator in post #14 does work though. is this the same arrows as the qqe??? it has the arrows with popup and audible alert. same or no???

--- 帖子 #130 ---
has anyone made an ea for this that works correctly? one that only trades during london and us open. other sessions don't seem to do well with this method. they are just not volitile enough

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I have tried 4 different versions of the QQE alert and none of them will produce arrows. Most don't even show anything on my charts including the one posted just a bit earlier. Can anyone help as to why they are not working and explain maybe what the problem is? Also is it that necessary for this system to be using the QQE alerts? Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
The indicator on post 14 is different from the QQE alert. It is just an alert for the MA 5/8 cross. The qqe alert is a seperate indicator.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
An EA has been made but it isn't perfect yet especially on the exits.The system doesn't only work at the time you specified above, but most signals between 6:00 GMT and 18:00 GMT are ok. Could you help perfect the EA?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
yea, i know that there are other signals out there not in london and us open but those markets move too slow and see a lot of whip saws during the slow sessions. i was just making a suggestion - trade during london and us only - and No i can't do anything with the ea. I have 0 programming experience. it is hard enough to get phone numbers in my cell phone!! I just like the idea of ea's and wish we had one for this that worked good. I have been forward testing other ea's with a fair amount of success. this would just be another weapon in the arsinal so to speak. If there are any programmers out there that could make this thing trade like its supposed to i would LOVE to see it!!! this system seems to be doing great. thanks a lot for it!!!! oh and still cant get qqe to work. everyone seems to be having this problem anyone know how to fix it????

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Try putting the ex.4 file in your metatrader/expert/indicator file then close down the terminal and restart it. The QQE Alert just gives alerts for the 'QQE' indicator cross and so if you have the QQE indicator, it will work fine. The QQE is very important to this system as it is known of moving averages to be whipsawed in ranging markets. That is where the QQE comes in. In filters out the moving average crossed and enhances the performance of the system in ranging markets. Also, remember that not there will be no exit until both indicators have changed over. I have attached the QQE indicator below. Its cross can be used in the place of the QQE alerts.

ok i finally got my chart to look like yours with all the indicators working. i just have a few questions. look at red lines -- why no arrows there -- look at X under arrow. why would there be an arrow there??? sorry if im buggin yall but i want to get this thing right. just trying to put my 2 cents in and help out any way i can.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I really like using this method though more testing is needed on my end. It would be really great if we had an EA that would alert us when everything lined up then manually enter the trade. Can some one put this together? I really prefer to look at the trade and feel good about it before throwing some lots in the market. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
that is already done. go to post 1 download indicators. i finally got qqe to work so if you have problems with it let me know and i can probably get you on the right track. other than the qqe, everything else is a snap

--- 帖子 #141 ---
JT, thanks man, I managed to get the QQE working as well but I should have phrased it different. I would like the EA to email me when all the indicators line up to enter a trade. And I haven't seen anything that does that on this thread. If there is let me know, I would really appreciate it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #142 ---
yea i know what you mean. and no it isn't here to my knowledge. it is just an alert you want then and not an ea correct? I wish someone would code the ea.- i don't like sitting and watching charts all day - call me lazy i guess. i have asked a few guys that have made me some ea's in the past if they would take a look at this and code one up but i haven't heard from any of them. I haven't forward tested long enough to pay for one but if it keeps looking good then ill pay to have one written

--- 帖子 #143 ---
taken care of by a single nice trend movement? explain please

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Mav, I think he means that the system isn't perfect (what system is) when ranging. And when you get a nice trend move on whatever pair you are trading, the amount of pips you would pick up will make up for whatever pips you might of lost when the pair is moving sideways. So when a trend does happen, the systen is designed to get you in early and get you out when the trend is over. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
he means this system works well in a trending market not a sideways one. be it up or down, just not flat. so sit out when the market is not going anywhere and jump in when a trend is established be it up or down. at least that is my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Brokers will not guarantee that neither your S/L; T/P or any pending or Immediate Execution WILL BE FILLED during news times. In other words, you can have the news spike the price against you HEAVILY and can shoot right past your exit order. Of course if the news does go in your favor there is no problem, but does one really want to take that chance and watch your account dip downwards drastically should you be wrong? I've watched the NFP report spike the news 200+ pips within seconds many times. Then it will do one of two things once it reaches a crescent. It will either reverse for 5 or 10 minutes, then continue traveling it's original direction, OR it will fall right back to the level it started at. Either way, when your wrong it's heart attack time on a real account. This is why there has NEVER been a profitable way (including straddling) of trading the news. Follow the pro's advise and close out all trades prior to major news releases!

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Wahnone, I must say a big thanks for sharing your system and hope u will continue to share more and to keep it alive.Still not having the QQE on my chart and for those that have gotten it right pls explain how or post it. For those that have contribute one thing or the other i say well done and to pls continue as well Flamenco,m78,orion70,e.t.c. Thanks Nerry.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi, Wahnone. In the Sideway Markert, add the DMI.ex4 indicator to cut the wrong trade. Try it. james

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi james, Thanks for that. one more thing, can u post a chart with it and let see.Thanks. Nerry

--- 帖子 #150 ---
That arrow is not signifying the cross of the moving averages and it has nothing to do with them. The arrow is the alert for the QQE indicator and as i have said earlier, it is used in conjuction with the moving average cross i.e no entry/exit until both change directions. Hope I have made myself clear...

--- 帖子 #151 ---
hello Wahnone, I was a little confuse when people were saying they didn't get it on their chart but now it is clear sir. Thanks Wahnone and GOD BLESS. Nerry.

Yea i figured it all out. thanks for the great system!!!! can't wait for the ea!!

Wahnone Thanks so much for sharing this method , its really working for me, I feel like I am dreaming and christmas has arrived early in August , never won trades so many times in a row, Trading on 1hour charts is slow and it gives me a lot of free time. i have even setup automatic sms notifications to my PDA when setups are ready to be traded. I have found THE system, I am not even going to change anything about it. I dont even want to use auto trading with an EA, just going to trade manually and keep it simple. Thank you Thank you

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Wahnone, can you tell us what kind of results you are getting on each pair that you use this method? Also is the EA working for you? I have been trying to get it to work on a demo acct and it smiles but does not enter any trades.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
hai wahone, thanx for the system. it is great. since im using your system i can get around +-50pips per day. just follow the signal, must on the right market time, also avoid news. but, would you please update the additional indicator on first page like QQE_AlertV3, MA_Candle and so on. because ut helps for those who want to try your system without asking you for many times.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Please do you trade this system only during the Euro and US sessions?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
So you've found this system helpful also on 1hr charts? Why don't you share some charts of your trades and tell us on which pairs you trade?... Keep hunting...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I have just started looking into other pairs and I will soon begin to post their charts also. As for the EA, there is still a lot to be fixed in it especially the way it exits the trade, as for now, I concentrate on manually carrying this system to ''Perfection''.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I trade between 6-7:00 gmt and 17-18:00 gmt. I have posted all my rules in the first post of this thread.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
OK.They are all ready in the zipped folder in the first post.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I think this system also works superbly on the 1hr charts of GBPUSD and EURJPY and I am sure it will also work on most other pairs. If you love the easy way, then maybe go to the 1hr charts and get a feel of what I am saying. Please, you can backtest it and post the results.

How do you get SMS messages to your PDA?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Made my first trade today, it was a short on USD/CHF, so far profit in the trade.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi L My cell phone service provider has a free email service that notifies me via sms when new email arrives, Unfortunately they only send you the subject of the email received not the message body, but that is okay because the subject from MT4 is "Expert advisor", So then I know that there is a possible setup to trade. I think the perfect setup would be to have MT4 email to a proper sms server , sending me an sms directly from MT4 , but the email notification via sms works for me. To get MT4 to send email alerts goto "TOOLS" -&gt; "OPTIONS" and then "EMAIL" tab in MT4 and setup your email server details in there. You can sent a test message from MT4 too once you have setup your email details. Remember that your email service provider must have an sms notification feature for this to work. To get the QQE alert arrows to email you when the arrows appears, right click on any QQE arrow on your chart and left click "QQE Alert v3 Properties", On the "INPUTS" tab , scroll down until you see the "ENABLEEMAILALERT" setting and set it to "TRUE" and click OK Now every time a new arrow is placed on your chart, an email is sent to the email address set in TOOLS/OPTIONS/EMAIL setting. Also remember that the arrows act as a heads-up on a possible trade , not to place a trade. The other indicators (stoc, MAs and MomentumVT) have to be considered first, before placing your trade. I hope you get the above stuff

--- 帖子 #169 ---
i think QQE_alert_V3 is not compatible with Vista, because im save in Office PC using XP, and no problem, when im back home, i save in laptop using Vista, it does not appear on the chart. so, i using another QQE,it is QQE_Alert_v1. i attached it, so you all can compare, is it the same?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I noticed that QQE_Alert_v1 does not even show up on my charts, only v3 does I am using MT4 on Fedora 8 Linux , Dont see how an OS can cause an indicator not to work. I cant stand Windoze anything , XP or Vista , I dumped it months ago when I found out how to get MT4 to run on Linux Can anyone else out there help?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Actually Vista puts the compiled *.ex4 (if you compile from metaeditor the mq4 files) files in c:\users\admin\appdata\local\virtualstorage\Program Files\your metatrader directory\experts\indicators directory ... and since QQE_Alert calls QQEA.ex4 they all have to be copied manually to c:\program files\your metatrader directory\experts\indicators directory. I use Vista and it does work. m78

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi all, just found the thread and am working on getting the template on to do some backtesting/forward testing. I ran into some issues after taking the zip and template file from post #1. The first one, was it was looking for qqqea.ex4 although the indicator provided was named differently (the version 3 provided). Noticing that, I renamed the qqq ex4 file to what it was looking for, and it crashed the mt4 platform. Restarted it, and now it's looking for key.ex4, no idea what that is. Trying to drag the qqq indicator on the chart caused it to crash again. So kinda stuck, any help is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I grabbed the template you provided recently and it at least fixed the problem of errors. However, it seems to be a typical problem of no arrows showing up with this QQE. Any way we can give some final instructions on how we get this to work? I have read and re-read all of the posts and it still confuses me. Are there two QQE files, one indicator and one alert? Or does version 3 have both in one? Would be nice to get everything in the zip file on post 1 we need, as well as that template fixed up so everything works out of the box. In looking at your chart examples (trying to study those until my alert arrows work), is there a specific number of bars you will wait after the alert is triggered and the ma's cross? I notice there are alot of entries and exits that you take that seem to be pretty far from either the alert arrow, or the ma cross, or even the stoch cross or momentum cross. And lastly, as far as the stoch is concerned, are we just looking for the cross of the stoch lines themselves, or for it to cross under 50 or over 50? Many of the charts in this thread have some different conditions of entry, and I just want to make sure I completely understand them so I can practice and test this. Thanks all, sorry for the long post.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Can you post your indicators and template please? Which pairs are you trading? For JPY pairs did you avoid USD news also? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #180 ---
hello, sorry interrupting, but i think all indicator and template put at post #1.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
POST #1 has all you need. As for the pairs I trade... EUR/JPY, its a lovely little volatile pair to trade, and thats the only pair I trade, I found that if you concentrate on one pair only, you learn its habbits of movement and almost get a sixth sense when predicting its price action. I have been looking at EUR/USD and USD/CHF, but have not traded them.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Can you upload the template please, I prefer yours. What about the news? Thanks

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Okay Template and indicators attached..... The news..... well... I dont take much notice of news on a 1 hour TF .... I just trade what ever my indicators show me, FundaMENTALS are just that , they can drive you MENTAL . On lower TF news can be a problem. I dont worry about the news times.

YES! , I always trade with a stop loss , normally 40-50pips on 1 hour TF or lowest low when long or highest high when short.

Hi Guys, I have been looking at a couple of threads, this being one of them, with trading ideas and thought I would like to try them out. It seems most people on this forum use metatrader.I was using another chart package, so I thought in order to get the correct settings and be able to use the EA I would also use the same…………..So I downloaded metatrader from IBFX on their demo package and set forth. Oh how I hate changing charting packages, seems harder to master them than to trade Forex !!!! Could anyone please help and explain the following to me in simple terms How do I get the various files ( mq4, ex4, tpl, etc) which are listed in the various trading systems, onto my charts. Any help would be really appreciated Thanks

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I know this is going to be a dumb question but what is the meaning behind the numbers on that clock. Thanks, cwave

--- 帖子 #201 ---
MQ4 files are the uncompiled form of the ex4 file. You have to compile them first with the metaeditor into the ex4 format which is what metatrader uses. The indicators and the expert advisors are usually in the mq4/ex4 format while templates are the tpl files. Put your indicators(ex4) files in: metatrader/experts/indicators directory and your templates(tpl) in the: metatrader/templates directory. The expert advisors should be in: metatrader/experts directory. Then close your charts and reopen it. You will find the indicators/experts/templates in place. Hope I have answered your questions.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanks Wahone, all oK now, looking forward to studying the system

--- 帖子 #203 ---
That is the time left for the current bar to end.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I knew the answer was sitting right in front of my face. I think this system has great potential. Happy Trading, cwave

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Stupid question... What does the QQE actually indicate? Also, how long should you wait between the QQE alert and the crossover or stoch trigger? Thanks, I think this system fits within my trading style quite nicely

--- 帖子 #206 ---
This strategy really works great. The EA that is in this thread doesn't work all that well. It has never taken a trade and when I take one manually, the EA, if enabled, will close out a portion of my lot every tick that goes in profit. I think there is some work to be done on this EA. So can we get the bugs worked out of it or have some one else build an EA that works well with some options on exiting like a trailing stop or close portion of the trade when a certain target has been hit. Also have the time of day that it is trading as a customizable as well. I would do it but don't have any programming skills. I have been using this strategy on the 5m charts on the eurusd, gbpusd, usdjpy, usdchf, and the eurjpy and having great success with it. An EA would just be nice so I can sleep at night instead of watch the charts. On my chart you will notice that I have the CCI 8 on there. I use this to help determine an exit point. So I wait for the Stochs to cross and the CCI to cross and that's when I get out.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Just to clarify on my exits. I will exit when ANY two of the indicators have turned. the reason I said I use the CCI is because it generally turns before any of the others. My SL is set at 20, but don't know if that is optimal. And I trade the hours suggested by Whanone. Open to suggestions on the SL.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Or if we can build an EA that will monitor all the indicators and then send an email to us when everything lines up for a possible entry, that would be pretty sweet as well. That way you can take a look at the trade and enter at your discretion.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hey Bradley, On your first long entry on your chart, I noticed there wasn't a QQE alert, are you not using that as an entry? Nice trades btw

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I just exited on a short position on the eurusd that netted 36 pips. Entered on the 15:35 candle at 975 and exited on the 16:55 candle at 939.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Taz, the QQE is there, it is just below the view of the screen, so I do use it.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Very good, thanks Still hoping someone can enlighten me as to what the QQE indicates, and how many bars should elapse between the QQE alert and other triggers lining up.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Why you didnt buy or sell in the next QQE arrows? (the 3 ones that are at the end of the SS)

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I did trade those, the first long one ended up -6, then short for +7, then long for -11.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Please can you provide the version of CCI above? Thanks

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Here is the CCI indicator.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Bonjour à tous CCI 8 seems better and faster than momemtum to show a trend. It is not 100% reliable but nothing is perfect. What are your opinion about this suggestion !? Thank you to all to share your trading system

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi Bradev, great trades today, and thanks for CCI8. Cantafio asked whether you traded the 3 trades showing on the screen shot, there were also a further 2 trades before the trade at 15.35, did you trade these also ? there are lots of positives about the system but today on E/U shows how MA's if not filtered successfully will allow whipsawing

--- 帖子 #219 ---
mlawren, Yes I did take those trades as well for -10 and -12. And you are absolutly right about the whipsaw action on the 5 min chart. The 15 min chart can be a little bit better as far as that goes and will keep you in trades longer and can give you better results. I just prefer to trade the 5 min charts as it gives me more action for an unpatient person.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Here are my results from today. I should note however that the eurusd is the only pair that I trade in the 5 min charts. The others are traded on the 15 min charts. (if I trades all on the 5, I would be executing trades all day and that's not too practical). EURUSD - 8 trades 4/4 net 162 pips GBPUSD - 2 trades 2/0 net 130 pips USDJPY - 4 trades 2/2 net 13 pips USDCHF - 3 trades 2/1 net 75 pips Total pips for the day; 380 pips Thanks for sharing this method Wahnone!

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Sorry to be a pain, but could i ask you to post some screenshots of some of your trades today for a couple of these pairs. You have little bit of your own twist on the strategy and im sure all of us would appreciate more examples of this as it could help us learn. Did you also trade in hours specified by Wahnone? Did you use fib resistance and support indicator like Wahnone does? You mentioned earlier that you use CCI8 for exits, but it does seem that you use it as entry trigger as well, is this correct? I just want to get better picture of what you're doing as my results were closer to break even, althou that was partially due to the fact i couldn't be at the computer the whole time. They could have been somewhat better but do not think they could have been anywhere near what you got with your particular approach. Regards. Luk

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Luk, I understand your concern. You do need to understand that I did spend the full time in front of my charts and I'm pretty sure I executed every signal between the hours of 06:00 and 17:00. I will say that if a signal comes up really close to 17:00 and it seems to me that the price is done moving for the day, I will not enter. Also, if I get into a trade, and then it turns against me and I decide to get out but then continues on in the direction I had entered, I will re-enter based on what the indicators are telling me. As you can see in my charts I re-entered on the usdchf at 15:00 hours due to the stoch's action. That particular trade went for +47 pips. The only other trades that I have not shown you from today is the ones from usdjpy which only netted 13 pips with 4 trades. Any other questions, I'd be happy to answer and I hope these charts help. BTW the total # of pips incudes the spread. so if I netted 10, it would 8 actual profit on the eurusd (2 pip spread). As far as using the CCI as an entry, it just another confirmation.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
mkaqren Did some one answer your question as yet or do you still need help???

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Peacelover, my question was answered and I'm up and running now, thanks anyway

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Wahnone, Thanks for a great system. I wanted to know what is the final chart settings and indicators for the system now. Peace Out

--- 帖子 #226 ---
The chart settings remain the same for me. I have made no changes.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Wow! That was good for you. So you also trade this system on other pairs too. Maybe it will work on probably all pairs. Why don't you check it on EURJPY too. It works.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
The QQE used as a filter alongside the moving averages. The number of bars that should elapse between it and other indicators doesn't matter. Just make sure there is a setup and exit when both the QQE and MA's have changed over.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I have checked most other indicators including the CCI, RSI, and other oscilators and found that each has it's own good part, but after backtesting manually, I felt that the Momentum Indicator is best for my trading system and personalty and that's why i use it. If you find other indicators OK, then use it.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Where in the ej_candle time indicator can I change the yellow color to another one? thanks for help

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I don't know myself how to change the colour. I don't think it can be done.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Yeah, can't change it on that candle timer, maybe can if you find the mq4 for it. Here are a couple other candle timers.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi guys, It seems today (Aug 12th) wasn't easy for the system. Do you mind sharing if anyone made it today ? m78

--- 帖子 #234 ---
It wasn't easy at all. But if you got 130+ pips with this same yesterday, then why worry about -50 pips today?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I added the QQ to my chart along with the other indacators but I cant see the QQ doing any thing. MOM Stac and 5/8 are all working good. Whats the QQ look like on the chart?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Because I had the same problem, as well as many others here, hopefully this will help you. Place the two attached files into your experts\indicators folder. The QQE should function and show arrows and trigger alerts. I have reattached a template provided previously as well, as it helped me get everything working properly. (that goes in your root templates directory, not the experts\templates directory). Close down and restart your mt4 platform after you put these files in the appropriate folders.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
thanks tazmann I will test it

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes today was really a tough day for this system. I actually stopped trading around 09:00 gmt just because of all the whipsawing and terrible price action. It didn't feel like it was going to do anything but range. There were a couple of opportunities to make a few pips but for the most part...not good. I ended up around -45 pips before I threw in the towel. Anybody want to do a EA on this that combines indicators and sends an email when a possible entry is triggered?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I was trying the eurjpy this morning but not good price action on that either. I will keep you posted on my results though.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Everything working fine now thx tazmaan

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi all... i am newbie in Forex trading and have been reading through all the post on this thread ... however i have some questions regarding the entry/exit signal.. hope some one could clarify Entry Signal Is there a sequence that we must follow before enter a buy signal? for example we first need to wait for 5/8 ma crossed upward (indicating uptrend), then follow by MomentumVT above 0 level, QQE pointnig up, finally Dinapoli Stoch bullish crossover, then only we enter a BUY Trade? or it doesnt really matter and no such sequence? The reason is that some time 5/8 ma has crossed upward but Momentum VT still under 0 level. Exit Signal Same as above, is there a sequence we have to follow before enter a short? Re-Entry Signal (Buy) In the first post you mentioned that we need to wait for all other indicators to be in the buy direction. Then wait for the Stoch indicator to turn from Sell into Buy (crossed upward) then only we enter. So the key indicator for re-enter is the Dinapoli Stoch? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
red my take on this is just to have all the inicators agreeing. It doesn't have to happen in any certain order.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
hi i test the method and i think it's a good method : Thanks Wahnone! m78 thanks for your ea but i test the ea and it open trade and it close quickly! have you a second version? thanks

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Today was a pippin' day for all of us , I guess, because I ended with 300+ pips today(13 Aug) on GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hey Wahone, What initial stoploss are you setting on your first entry? I've been playing with this live, however fighting with initial stoploss to keep me in it long enough to catch the trend. Thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi rich, You trade 1 hr TF, I guess you must set profit target to get R:R ratio. If you do what method you are using to set TP? Or anyone who set TP on this system - please share your ideas Thank you, Pete.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi Wahnone, You trade only between 6-7 gmt &amp; 17-18 gmt that's is very short working hour, it's great. I saw your post 11 you said you trade from 5 -19 gmt or may be you change you trading time cos this system made big pips Thanks, Pete.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
If you use EA, I think we have to let the system run all day and all night

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi, all guys Very glad to have the chance to discuss with everyone here. I'm a newbie for FX, but I have read lots of posts here and I think I am making progress. The system described in this article is very useful, I think. So I must give my sincere thanks and regards to the author, Mr. Wahnone, for your great idea; as well as Mr. m78, who wrote the great idea to an EA. As to the problem of this EA that Mr. Wahnone commented at the early page(How to exit our positions), I think it's easy to slove for we should only change the code in the original EA, from " if ((lasttradedir != dircross &amp;&amp; imdiff &gt;= closeemadiff) || qqeacross) { " to " if ((lasttradedir != dircross &amp;&amp; imdiff &gt;= closeemadiff) &amp;&amp; qqeacross) {" only.This can satisfy the comment that Mr. Wahnone meationed above. On the other hand, I found that it is not effective if the EA uses a trailing stoploss. I have tried to add the trailing stoploss funtion to the EA, but the backtest result is not so good. Because even we use trailing stoploss,when it is hit but the entry situation has not changed yet, the EA will accord the old trend to open new trades again. In many cases,it is dengenrous as the old trend maybe will end soon, that is, the EA have to take long position at a top or a short position at a bottom. Although the EA is able to close the positions when the entry situation totally changed to the opposite direction, it is too late as the the profits got from the repeated trailing stoploss will loss again at the moment the new entry exits. I have no new idea to slove this problem. Certainly, if we use trailing stoploss manually, the reslut will be still good. Maybe this is a pity as an EA is just a robot only, It is difficult to control all well like humanbeens. I agree on Mr. Wahnone's comment meationed above, that is, we can get great results too if we use larger TF such as 1H instead of 15 Min when we depend the EA to work only, as the backtest results for 1H were extremely better than those of 15 Min TF. Sorry for my poor English. Best regards.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
can you please post the screenshot ? m78

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I also would like that clarified please. 2 hour total trading window is quite a change from 14 hrs. Regards. Luk.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Have a think about the times 18 - 6 = 12

--- 帖子 #253 ---
6-7 gmt &amp; 17-18 gmt look more like 2 separate sessions per &amp;, hence 2 hrs..... 6-7 thru 17-18 would be 1 session 12hrs. Maybe i misunderstood it.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
No drama. You didn't know what he meant , and I didn't know what you meant.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
All good, english is my 2nd languo, as im sure its for many if not most members here so sometimes there are some confusions so its better to double check.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hello people, This is a great method by Wahnone, take it or leave it. As for the time, i guess this is what it means : either between 6-17 GMT OR 7-18 GMT. Hope this settle the drama. Hunt for the pips guys. Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Not sure where are you getting this "drama" from when there wasn't any at all. I think some people are little too sensitve and need to relax instead of trying to see something that isn't there. If there was drama i wouldn't be nice at all. Regards. Luk.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
The EA doesn't take one trade today on my ODL Demo account . But I found it has taken 2 trades in today's backtesting till now. The first is a short position opened at 1.8650 at GMT 01:15 and closed at 1.8720 at GMT 08:30.The second one is a long position opened at 1.8720 at GMT 08:30 (just 10 mins ago) and now is still in trading. Totally it gained -70 pips for GBP/USD in 15M TF till now. I don't know how does such difference happen. Maybe there is something wrong with my MT-4 or the broker's server? Is anyone here same as me? BTW, I let the EA run all day and all night without any rest.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
What color do you want the indicator to be in?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Thanks Wahnone for sharing this system with us. I will try it on a demo ! What I will add to this system for myself is that i will look at the overall trend on a 1H chart. If it is down then i will only enter the shorttrades as longtrades will mostly not last long.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
The EA is still under making and its not advisble that you use it to trade as of now.

--- 帖子 #262 ---

I read about the laguerre indicator and after checking it out myself, I was convinced it is a good one, so I decided to compare it with the momentum indicator. The Laguerre was quicker to respond and at the same time, it acts well as filter. The momentum lags a bit and so it responds slower than the Laguerre, but on few occasions, it shows up faster than the laguerre. Since the Dinapoli Stoch is just there for re-entry, I removed it and replaced it with the Laguerre indicator. How to Use: Buy: As in first post. But instead of waiting for the momentum to cross above zero line, enter if any of the two laguerre lines(red/blue) cross 0.15 or 0.45 up. Sell: As in first post. But instead of waiting for the momentum to cross below zero line, enter if any of the two laguerre lines(red/blue) cross 0.15 or 0.45 down. Whichever comes first between the laguerre and the momentum is the one you go with. Caution: Please, the using laguerre with this system is still under testing and I advise not to trade real yetwith the laguerre.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Wahnone, could you post this indicator. I don't seem to have it. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Settings: Gamma01: 0.55 Gamma02: 0.85 MaxBars: 9500 Levels: 0.85, 0.45, 0.15. Please, don't trade real with the laguerre yet because I am still demo trading it myself.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
What exzackly is the QQE? I love the indicator never used it before. Also on exit when the moving averages cross do you wait for the bar to finish? do you wait for the bar after it to finish to confirm? Can some one post a exit do to the cross

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Today was somehow for gbpusd but I managed to get 45+ pips. I traded on three pairs because I have discovered that if a particular pair is ranging, another will be trending and vise versa. Here are the results: GBPUSD ... 45+ pips USDJPY ... 40+ pips EURJPY ... 70+ pips. Total was around 150+ pips.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thanks Wahnone for the indy. Here is a chart that I wanted to share with you just for fun. Crazy spikes on the swissy and on the third one, I jumped in long at 1.0893 and in a split second took me for a ride up 40 pips. Crazy eh.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Based on this graph, do you label correctly the entry point between laguerre and momentum? It seems to be momentum show the entry signal first (Momentum already crossed down 0 level) then only laguerre entry (cross 0.45 down) show up. Please correct me if my understanding is incorrect.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I've been using your system and would love to see how it would run as an EA. cwave

I mostly trade the eurusd and the gbpusd. I feel agressive I will trade on the eurjpy. With this srtategy, I am trading the 15 min charts and on the eurusd the 5 min charts. I dropped the Dstoch though and added amulti time frame stoch which seems to be working well. Iff it continues to produce good results I will post the indy. In the chart, the first trade I went long for 30 pips. As you can see, with the stochs all pointing in the same way, I'm inclined to get in before the MAs turn andthe QQE as long as the CCI is in agreement. I went short at 31 (all three stochs on the indy were pointing down). This seems to be a good trade. Am still in it right now but will prob close in a bit.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Sounds like a simple system, maybe you should start your own thread and get some support to enhance your system.

Thank you so much for your help. I'm still little bit confused here. I took a few trades following the system and i closed all of them around 15-20 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I am a little hesitant at this time to post it just because while it may show you one direction on all three lines (3 TFs) until all TFs close their respective times, it will continue to move and will give you a lot of false signals. If you really want it pm me your email address and I will give it to you but with this disclaimer. Back testing will do you no good with this indy. Only forward test and watch the lines as the market moves. This indy requires a lot of practice and maybe even a little feel just because of all the movement.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Here you go, this chart shows where i got in LONG and had to get out with a loss since the ma's crossed against me with other indicators.

Oh ok i see, i thought it was because of the timing. That's why i was asking earlier in my posts for the translation in time to Est. Thank you so much for your help.

I'm guilty as welll...but aren't we going too OT? This 3D is about the SSS...which I have founnd valid thus far ($wise)....without wanting to undermine any other efforts to a simple yet "effective" system (alas we're never going to have a 100% win ratio....) just my .02

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Please what TF and pairs do you trade with this system?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi All, I think that the Stoc is useless for the original setup. I did not find a situation that moving average (Main Indicators) crosses but before that the Stoc did not cross. Please advice Thanks

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Here is an example of a trade i took on EUR/JPY following the system when all indicator were in agreement but it was before 6gmt. I went long and soon the trade went against me and went down without having QQE arrows showing up letting me know to exit. Am i missing something here or is it just the fact that i traded before 6 gmt? THanks.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
thank you for the reply,but how do I install it to the MT4,the cog indicator,if you can send step by step instruction,I would really appreciate

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I already said it that the stoch is not used as one of the confirmations to entrying a trade, but just used if you probably missed out on the setup and look to enter along with the ongoing trend.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi Wahnone, Can you please post the candles that you are using in your chart that calculate the EMA's automatically please. It looks easier and better. Thank you,

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I will post the trades I take using this method if yall would like. here is what i have done this morning so far

--- 帖子 #319 ---
very nice results are you trading in live account?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
No, I have an ea running in my live account and im practicing this while i watch my ea run. have been doing this method on and off for a little while but now im gonna get religious about it. Main problem is getting whipsawwed to death in slow market. only gonna do it during london and us. as long as good trades can wipe out false breakouts that these type of systems have then should be ok. like right now. market kinda blah

--- 帖子 #321 ---
now we are taking off because of us open. should have some trades soon

--- 帖子 #322 ---
can someone please tell me when to enter a trade so I can see when would be the best time with this system so far I have not done to well I enter to late or way to early and chicken out to soon. Thank you

--- 帖子 #323 ---
just took 4 trades. will update on how they go

--- 帖子 #324 ---
what are they and long or short

--- 帖子 #325 ---
right now im long gu, eu, ej and short uc

--- 帖子 #326 ---
tell me why long on ej please

--- 帖子 #327 ---
sorry eu

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Anyone has any input on my questions and my chart...?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
what about logarythmic charting tools?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Forextrader4, have a look at post 153 for the candles, MA Candles.

Hey guys! well,i'm trading in my Live account, in this morning i felt in some traps because i havent waited US to open,big mistake: http://img501.imageshack.us/img501/5683/eurusduk5.jpg But i have got 40 Pips on another trade: http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3484/gpbhd3.jpg I have closed it because i will take a break now,I just was wanting to get my lost pips back. And thats just the begin of the day! a lot of trades will come! I have to be more carefull and pay atention on Opening/closing markets! well, Its an Amazing System! A+++++++++! Thanks to Wahnone for sharing and thanks everybody who is helping to improve it!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
well not a bad day 92 pips. i think ill quit for the day if anyone has questions pm me. GOOD LUCK everyone!!! the following are trades i made today only from london open until now. may stop but if GREAT setup comes ill take it

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Do you program expert advisors? If so, why dont you get one for this system. The other one made by m78 still has some issues about exiting our positions (page 6 post 90). Could you go through the code and fix the problems? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
No, no the ea is running something totally different. and i am no programmer. I have had a few people make them for me in the past. had to pay of course. I can get you in touch with them if you would like. and i forgot i had one trade still open but just closed. still up 74 pips on the day. thanks for the system

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I can see you are making a lot of pips already, but why have you exited your last trades when the signal has not come up? Maybe you introduced your own filtering and would like to share with us.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
well I have had several people pm with the same question. Here is what im doing. I am using your initial idea and that is about it I use the 5 and 8 emas and stochs ( set to default ) That is it! Keep it SIMPLE remember everyone???? I enter once the cross has been made and new candle comes out and stochs agree. open at start of new candle and NEVER In Mid candle. I use a 30 pip sl Close: if im long - ill let the stochs go above 80 and then come back down. when they break below 80 im out opposite for short of course (20) I know what some of yall are saying...... you are missing out on pips but no im not. im just locking in profit!!! sure i may have gotten more pips if i would have stayed in but sometimes Im right. I use more of a mental stop than a hard stop. i know that doesn't do anyone on here any good. but keep watching it and get a feel for it. ive been doing good in demo with this approach. I will be posting like this everyday if yall want me to. just let me know. if im getting in the way of the original system also let me know and ill post these trades somewhere else thanks for the system and any comments are more than welcome : good, bad or indifferent

--- 帖子 #337 ---
look at all those pips out there. i decided that 73 was enough for 1 day and look what is going on right now. right now im looking at 140 pips that could have easily been gotten. im looking at gu, eu, ej, uchf, and uj charts all 15 min

--- 帖子 #338 ---
A really fantastic result!! Maybe you can post a few charts with your trades - so we can all learn from it. :-) Have a nice evening!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hey JT! "I will be posting like this everyday if yall want me to." Please do!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
JT, I am trading with Oanda ...there are no custom settings for the EMA's, and there is no Dinapoli Stochastics available. So my questions are: 1) Are standard settings for the EMA's adequate? 2) Will standard Slow Stochastics with standard settings be a viable alternative to the Dinapoli Stochastics, or are you actually using Slow Stochastics? Many thanks...keep up the good work and postings!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Will someone add money management to this EA so that it stands a chance of being profitable. Also it will not backtest on daily chart. I take it that it uses original rules momentum and QQE for filter of entering trades?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Question what are the dotted lines on your chart please I am trying to set my charts up

--- 帖子 #343 ---
what dotted lines? the red and blue lines in the botton? is the CCI

--- 帖子 #344 ---
the ones around the candle area

--- 帖子 #345 ---
oh its the zigzag , i'm using just for trade confirmation i have attached the indicator,if you decide to use it

--- 帖子 #346 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I am using just regular stochs with 5,3,3 settings and 5 ema applied to close and 8 ema applied to open. that is it below is a trade that i took the 42 pips on

--- 帖子 #348 ---
the above trade is a perfect example of where the stochs will get you out "almost" perfectly. that was a picture perfect trade!! there are many other examples of where exiting like this may have gotten you out too early though so take this for what its worth. just my style thats all

--- 帖子 #349 ---
thats a great way to find an good exit! i will use it,thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Very powerful system for a short timeframe

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I would like to ask if you guys stay off medium impact news too??

--- 帖子 #352 ---
i stay off,i just ignore low impact news

--- 帖子 #353 ---
That means there shouldn't be trading based on this method this morning; am i right as PMI news coming across Euro pairs and Retail sales on the pound. If i am right????

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hey JT, Many thanks for your clarification. I will attempt to emulate your success!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
well guys if yall want to trade that way don't let me stop you but it isn't the way the original system was set up. This is just my 2 cents. Ill be posting my trades as I make them again today. I hope we can get those pips

--- 帖子 #356 ---
someone should start a mirc or a skype chat site for those who follow this. think this is possible?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
So you have no trades opened yet; not even the cross yen pairs?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
just opened 3, will post again when closed or open a new one

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I might start one on trading rooms but lets make it begin Next week

--- 帖子 #360 ---
azjeff has drawn my attention to this system and perhaps I can do up an EA for it. maybe someone has already done one but I thought one more EA won't hurt and I tend to prefer writing EAs with my customisation capabilities. What I need now is the confirm set of rules to follow. Is it still going according to post 1? or has it evolved throughout the posts? I have no time to read thru everything as I'm concurrently doing a few other systems' EA as well. aside from the specific rules, I need the actual indicators attachments too. there's so many posted in the attachment list I don't know which are the right ones to use. providing the mq4 files for the indicators would be helpful too as I can then use less of iCustom which can significantly increase the speed of backtesting. the sooner I get these info, the sooner I can start work on developing the EA. Hope to hear from you guys soon. Good luck and good trading. =) regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #361 ---
very whippy out there so far this mornin

--- 帖子 #362 ---
thanks a lot for your time. i think you better let the system starter himself answer that. he has done a great job putting a system out there for us to play with so he should be the one to have the ea the way he wants it

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I was about dragging his(azjeff) ass here from tsd too. Basically all the files(templates and indis) you need are in the first post.At least they work fine for me. I contacted my other mq4 friend and told me it might be difficult to code a Good EA as the system is lil discretionary and working with the Dinapoli Indi too might proof tough. He also complained about exits too. I would be happy if you could take the challenge. You very Welcome Zen...Hope to hear from you soon.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
hey jt; i tot the system says we stay out of news ...Or do u just avoid high impact ones???

--- 帖子 #365 ---
well it couldn't be more choppy. im using a 30 hard stop and the other 2 u see for today i closed because got opposite signal. CHOPPY CHOPPY CHOPPY. one of these breakouts will be good though. should make up for this CRAP!!!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
im playing with this thing right now. im gonna take each and every signal from london open to us close. at least the ones i can make myself stay at computer and catch. i mainly want to see if the good breakouts will more than cancel out all the false breakouts a system like this has. so right now im trading all the time. if i were live then i have the opinion of leaving the news times to the pros and im not there yet. i will be out on medium and higher news time.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
would be a great idea if we could set one up - even on teamspeak if necessary - but I think skype would be faster/easiest... anycase great going...I like the system..just have to be a little more disciplined on my entries (candle open). On my part I now add pivots and s+r levels...couple of times got in long and found i was right under double resistance...

--- 帖子 #368 ---
well making them back. but they are hard to come by today!!!! i think im gonna quit for today. may come back for us open

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi all.....have traded once with this sytem + 30 pips eu/usd so far will keep up to date with you all, using tf15 with close confirmation with tf30.....only trade eu/usd, not to familiar with other currencies at mo...still newbie....thanks to all

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Files needed are in 1st post. There is another file that is needed, i think, on page 6 post 80. On page 6 there is also 1st version of the EA made for it with souce code, althou not working exactly to the rules. It would also be helpfull if you could go over Wahnone's posts in this thread as he has some helpfull tips and talked about problems with 1st EA.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thank you zen.The rules remain the same i.e Chart setup: EMA 5 close EMA 8 open MomentumVT 10 QQE Smooth Factor 1 1)Buy: 5/8 ma up crossover MomentumVT above 0 level QQE crossing up Exit buy: When the 5ema cross down across the 8ema and the QQE has crossed down. Until both occur, there is no exit. 2)Sell: 5/8 ma down crossover MomentumVT below 0 QQE crossing down Exit sell: When the 5ema cross up across the 8ema and the QQE has crossed up. Until both occur, there is no exit. I only trade from 8:00 gmt to 18:00 gmt but it would be better if the time settings could be customizeable. NB: I purposely dropped the QQE alert and use the original QQE indicator bescause i couldn't get the QQE alert.mq4 file. Also, the heikin ashi and dinapoli stoch are no longer needed. The indicators are posted below. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hello Wahnone, You have a terrific system here. Zen, Thank you for taking the time of building an ea for this system. Many pips to everyone, Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #373 ---
as always, before I get started, I want to get things down as detailed as possible. a trading robot doesn't work half as well as the human perception so I need specifics. please bear with me. 1. do you wait for the candles to close for a confirmed signal? or do you take them as they come? better yet, would you like to have an option for both? 2. must the signals occur on the same candle? if not, what is your desired buffer number of candles for all signals to occur? again, I can set this as a configurable value. I just need a number for the default. 3. for the MomentumVT, do you just care if its above or below 0? or do you only consider it if it has crossed from below 0 to above 0 and vice versa? 4. I'm new to the QQE indicator. how do you read it? when dotted line cross over solid line, is that a buy or sell signal? 5. Am I right to say you do not want me to program any stop loss and take profit? the trade should just exit upon opposite signal? regardless in profit or loss. that's all I have for now. will post more questions as I go. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hey guys! well,today i have started trading at 12:45 gmt because of the bunch of news,i have stoped trading now because will come more news at 14:00 gmt. till now,one fast trade and 30 pips: http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9625/todayvr9.jpg I have added parabolic SAR and zigzag to help to filter out the bad trades.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Are you now using the laguerre, as you talked about in an earlier post? You said: "I read about the laguerre indicator and after checking it out myself, I was convinced it is a good one, so I decided to compare it with the momentum indicator. The Laguerre was quicker to respond and at the same time, it acts well as filter. The momentum lags a bit and so it responds slower than the Laguerre, but on few occasions, it shows up faster than the laguerre. Since the Dinapoli Stoch is just there for re-entry, I removed it and replaced it with the Laguerre indicator." Can you please post a screenshot and list of your current indicators being used?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Reply to question 1 I wait for the candle to close for a confirmed signal. Reply to 2 No. They don't have to occur at the same time. Set it as configurable, but as a default, you can set it as 15 bars. Reply to 3 It should just be below/above the zero line and not neccesarily cross from above to below and vise versa. Reply to 4 For buy, solid line cross up over dotted line i.e solid line above, dotted line below. For sell, solid line cross down below dotted line i.e solid line below, dotted line above. Reply to 5 You should program take profit, stop loss, and trailing stop .I would like to to also be able to move stoploss to break-even when I am a particular number of pips in profit e.g say I am +30 pips, move stoploss to break-even. All these should be set to be customizable. Thank you very much for your help. I am very grateful.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I am not using the laguerre as I find it too choppy for my liking. The only indicators being used now are the momentumVT, QQE alert or QQE indicator, and the moving averages. Below is a screenshot of EURJPY for today containing both the QQE alert and the QQE indicator.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
After checking, I found that the QQE misbehaves at times. For instance, today, I entered sell at 9:00 gmt with stoploss at 30 pips. After going +25 pips, price reversed and I exited with the QQE at -30 pips. If I had waited until the QQE came up, I would have exited with about -60. I had been thinking of moving my stoploss to breakeven when I was +25 pips up but I decided to go with my rules as to exit only when the ma's and the QQE indis have turned over. Now, here is my conclusion: Once I am in substantial profit, say 20+ (20 and above), I look to move my stoploss to break even. For now, I don't have a set stoploss nor breakeven point yet, but with time and as soon as the EA is ready(thanks to Zen and azjeff), I hope I will arrive at a fixed number for stoploss and breakeven point. Till then, Good Hunting .

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I want to ask you Wahnone if you don't care about medium impact news.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Concerning the news issue, it depends on you. You can trade this system without paying any attention to the news if you can bare the effects of the spikes. On my own, I don't enter a new trade when a big news is really near(i.e news in red from FF home page), say 15-30 minutes. If I have a trade already running, I just lock in my profits because I don't know if the news will go against me or for me.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi All, I have been using 3 different TF ( 1min, 5min, 15min) with this simple system. TF1min will help me pinpoint entry point. For order management, i use an EA which i get from other forum. This EA help me place my SL, BE n also will adjust the SL limit. I am sharing the EA for you all to test. Many thanks to Wahnone for this great simple system

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thanks bro ...Will test

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thanks. Could you share how to use it?, as I am having problems getting it to work.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thanks. Could you share how to use it, as I am having problems getting it to work?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
There are four parameter in the EA which can be customize/changeable. InitialStop - This is your SL value once order been made. BreakEven - Default at 20 pips after profit. The SL will change to ur initial point. StepSize - The number of pips u want the SL value to move. MinDistance - The gap between current price before any changes of movement. If based on the default value at all parameter, after placing an order : StopLoss will be automatically set at 30 pips from order price. SL value will move every 5 pips and with 10 pips minimum distance from current price. As the current price moving upwards/downwards, SL value will follow step by step. A green line will appear on the chart once pass BE point. The EA will continue adjust the SL untill u been stopout.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Great simple system Wahnone! Thanks for sharing! Caught 82 pips on my first real trade with the system last week after testing in a demo account for a while. Haven't had much time to trade since then as I was sick, but it's a great system so hopefully I'll be able to catch quite a few more pips with it. Looking forward to the EA and would like to say thanks to everyone who's working to put it together.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Zen, thank you for your help in creating an EA with Wahnone. I appreciate it and I'm sure everyone else here does too. PD

--- 帖子 #388 ---
the market is slow today thats annoying

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Took 40 pips long on eu/usd, could have been 130 (EA would've been handy there) but had to go to bed. thanks Wahnone for a neat little system &amp; Zen for starting work on the EA

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Are you sure....With Oil price reaching a soaring price of about $6/barrel and the weakning $$.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
There were definitely some opportunities out there today, and there also appeared to be a couple false signals, though they would have been minor losses. It was my first day trying the system, and I netted -4.5 pips. I missed out on the GBP/USD and EUR/USD moves. Being on USA ET, I don't get to the computer until 8 AM ET (13:00 GMT), and by then the GBP and EUR were already well into their moves up, so I was afraid to get into them at that point. If I had only known they would continue up all day! Oh well. My best trade today was on EUR/JPY for about +24 and worst was USD/JPY at 14:00 for -20 where the price completely reversed as soon as I entered. In retrospect, it didn't look like the Momentum had gone above the zero line (it merely touched it), although on the first few seconds of the next bar it definitely went above zero only to retreat later in the bar. I guess you really need to have the momentum above zero at the very close of the bar (for a buy). I used a trailing stop of 20 on my four trades today. I would venture with the GBP/USD, I would use a trailing stop of 30. Looking forward to getting better at the system. I can tell it's definitely got merit. Thanks for sharing it, Wahnone. Scott

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Krufx, that's where you set a stoploss about 10 pips under your current profit and then go to bed. Your head will hit the pillow knowing you can do no worse than 30 (very respectable) but with a chance for a lot more if the trend continues. And what a surprise you would have had in the morning. Scott

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Forgive me if there has already been a discussion about this, but has anyone else noticed that there is almost always at least a minor retrace immediately after a signal is given? Does anyone who trades this system regularly wait for the retrace before entering or do you find that it's better to get in right away so that you don't risk missing it if it doesn't retrace? Any advice on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Very true Scott, should of, could of, would of, but did'nt Kev

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Is there anyway we can setup a chat room for this thread??

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Tradingrooms[dot]com has free rooms available for such a purpose. Someone would just need to set it up and share the info here. Scott

--- 帖子 #397 ---
That would be up to Wahnone, seeing he is the author to this

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Wahnone, I was unable to attach the file on a personal message. So I am attaching it here. I was talking of adding a moving average to the momentunVt and take the trade when the Moving avg of the mom has been crossed along with the conformation from the 5 and 8 EMAs Sorry thats the best i can do with this picture.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
+ 40 pips so far on short gu

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Sorry my stupid question, what is EA? I'm new here

--- 帖子 #401 ---
EA (expert advisor) another term for auto trading, in other words it does the thinking, emotions for you

--- 帖子 #402 ---
The Simple Great System !!

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Locked in another 30 pips

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hey Kru ...Catch ur ass lurking on the intrady thread....lol

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Can't wait for a working Expert for this system.Would love to see the results of the tests.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
what would you like as default values for take profit, stop loss, breakeven pips and trailing stop? and also for the trailing stop, would you want a floating trail or a jumping trail? floating trail in a long position makes the stop level move seamlessly as the price goes up, constantly leaving a gap of the set amt of pips from the current price. it then maintains the stop at the level when the price is moving in the opposite direction to secure profit. where as a jumping trail waits for the price to move in the direction of the trade by this amt of pips before jumping up to the next stop level as defined by the trailing value. I'm not sure if I'm reading it right. you want the signal buffer to be 15 candles. that's more than 3 hours on a 15 minutes chart. isn't that a bit too long for a signal confirmation on a relatively low time frame? regards, Zen p.s., the EA is pretty much done. I just need to confirm I'm getting the rules right. will post up version 1 tonight when I get home.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hey Zen you're the man....thanks so much for your time and effort much appreciated by me &amp; i'm sure all others in this thread

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Nice effort so far. On the buffer issue; you might leave that out for now since this should be a prototype .Just let the trigger be pulled at the instance when all the rules are adhered to, but if you care to add it 2 bars is enough; and i like the idea of the jumping trailer; but set it as optional.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I think the signal buffer of 15 candles is to long, but we will wait for Wahnone to answer this

--- 帖子 #411 ---
And thanks again for your time

--- 帖子 #412 ---
too late... I've already coded both trailing methods in. you'll be able to choose what type of trailing you want via the input settings. =)

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Another 40 + pips gu thanks again Wahnone

--- 帖子 #414 ---
No problem but hope the buffer is not 15 candles cos that is way too much for a 15M timeframe.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Can u tell us what the buffer will be Zen thanks mate

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Peacelover, how do you get a MA of the Mom indicator like that? I tried dragging an MA on top of that window, but it inevitably ends up on the top window. Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Congrats. The only thing that bugs me about this system is that I am in bed when most of the big moves begin or occur (am in the U.S.). The GU and EU started their downward trends at 3 AM here. I'd stay up, but I have to work during the day. Scott

--- 帖子 #418 ---
YEAH its a bugga i'm not awake during the US session where the most goes on, thats why i need an EA

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hey azjeff; Did you attempt coding an EA too??

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hey femzy, you have been here awhile, how many trading systems have u tried ?????? regards kev

I can't count!!! Or maybe i am still counting rather!!!

Hello again guys! well,i have a daily goal of 50 pips and i will try to not be greedy and stop trading always when i reach it. Today i took a trade on eur/jpy and i got +47 pips: http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/3672/72924909tl9.jpg - I am also trading on 30 min time frames because the trades on 30 min tf are more intense -and i'm also using bolinger bands to keep me out of slow and choppy market ( like yesterday) - i'm using zig zag and parabolic SAR to confirm the signal happy pip'in ps: any other forex girls here?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yep a couple of girls here I have been still using the TF15 but with backup of the TF3O made some nice pips too

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Zen, I have to agree that the buffer of 15 is way too wide. Having the option to set that to our own personal taste is great however, so if that's the only thing keeping you from finishing is presetting the buffer size, I'd make it 2 bars. We can always change it to more ourselves. I know when he said 15 bar buffer that kinda threw me off too, cause all the time I have spent watching this method on a chart there's no way i'd want to jump into a trade 3 hours after the move started I am excited about your EA, as the good session time for the E/J is difficult for me to trade (trade futures so hard to be up during asian session AND us session!) Thanks for all your hard work

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I write all my EAs as customizable as possible. so the buffer is actually a user input value. I'm only asking out of curiosity and also for a proper default value.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Ok thanks for your time &amp; effort, i'm sure Wahnone will be along soon to appreciate your effort

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Krufx, What settings are you using for the zig zag and parabolic SAR ? Do you mind sharing the zig zag indiactor. Peace

--- 帖子 #429 ---
check the last post on page 23 for the zigzag indicator,

Thanks

I have the QQE, QQE alert v3 on my chart. What does it do? Is there supposed to be a red or blue arrow as a preliminary signal? If I just have the QQE v3 loaded without QQE, nothing shows on my chart. I don't see any arrows at all in scrolling back for weeks. If the arrows do appear, do they stay on the chart? I loded the template and all indis on both WTC, and IBFX charts, just to make sure there wasn't some problem with WTC. Same thing there. No visible sign of any QQE v3 or any arrows, yet QQE v3 is listed on my chart as being there. Perhaps there's a simple explanation?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Had the same problem with one of the versions that was floating around on the thread. These ones work fine though (and the alert works also)

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Scott, On the Parameter tab "Apply to:" drop-down menu, choose either "Previous Indicator's Data" or "First Indicator's Data." PD

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I have the QQE alert v3, but not the QQEA. BUT, I have already loaded from post 14 by mart-hart the 5-8 Open EMA Cross Arrow with Alerts.mq4. This sure seems like the one that's needed, too, as it does show the arrows, and I have already gotten the audible alert. VERY cool. One thing I noticed, though, is that the arrow shows up on the candle PREVIOUS to the alert, meaning that, even though the alert came at 22:45, the arrow is shown under the 22:30 candle. Not a problem now that i know it. But, someone looking at a chart that doesn't know this thinks the indication came 15 minutes earlier than it really did. Overall, this looks like a very, very good system and one that is not complicated to implement. Already made 10 practice pips on my first day trying it! Thanks for the help. (PS to Wahnone....maybe the indi from mart-hart should be on the first page in the zip file?)

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi, Zen. Thanks for the EA, your efforts are really appreciated. For take profit, you can put it at +200 pips. For Stop loss, use 30 or 40. For the breakeven point, put it at 25 pips. As per the trailing stop, I suggest, if possible, that you make the EA have both the jumping trail and the floating trail. If this can't be done, I will prefer the jumping trail. The signal buffer doesn't have to come before a set number of bars, that's why I told you to make this customizable and I only put it at 15 because there must be a default. Please, also remember to make the trading period customizable, but you can leave defaults at 7:00gmt to 17:00gmt. Thanks a lot once again.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
actually is me who is using the parabolic sar and zigzag, the settings of the Psar are 0.03 and 0.2 i have also added bolinger bands,settings 7,3,0

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thank you, PD. Scott

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi Wahnone thanks again for this system it is much appreciated... Don't mean to reign on your parade but could the SL be changeable 0 thru to 40 Thanks again Zen as well

--- 帖子 #439 ---
All these values are changeable to ones personalty. The values that will be used are just defaults.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
This is version 1. I've yet to test it thoroughly so do let me know if you find anything peculiar. I've described the usage in the pdf attachment. have fun! Good luck and good trading. best regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Thanks, Zen Leow. I have loaded the EA on demo accounts on 15 minute charts on EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, and EUR/JPywith a TP of 50 on Interbank and WHC demo accounts., and changed the time to run 24 hours. This should be a good test, and also will comkpare the results on all time frames. Will report back afterwards.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Thanks Zen testing it on demo too

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hey Zen, thanks for your work on the EA, testing it now as well. One clarification, on the signal and exit buffer setting: These are still in relation to the number of bars, not timeframe right? So default of 5 and 15 are 5 bars and 15 bars? Also, the exit buffer is just how many bars you give it for the signals to align to trigger an exit, it has no relation to how long it's been since you have entered the trade? Thanks again, I look forward to seeing the results!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks very much Whanone for this. I have created an EA for this strategy. I decided to post the report before i post the source code. Please tell me if you think this is good enough. PS: The test period is 27.05.2008 -&gt; 22.08.2008

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Ok don't know if this is a fault but it just closed an open short order 9 pips b4 my stop loss eg. SL was 162.40 (value 30)it closed it @ 162.49, is this anything to do with that floating stop Thanks

I tried everything to get that % but i couldn't. can you help ?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hello Zen, My friend very good work. As always, people should demo test the ea out and let's try to come up with some profitable settings. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I did what it said, downloaded the data on another MT4 client and performed my tests. This time i got 125 mismatched chart errors and modeling quality n/a I did some optimization that increased the net profit. The trading between 8-9 GMT only and moving the stop to breakeven at +60 pips gave the best results. This test is between 2007.11.14 - 2008.08.22

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi tara, i see u have TP set to 0

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Zen, thank you for your efforts on the ea, I am testing it on the one min just to see if it is working properly. Amazingly it is making money on my demo account so great work. However, it will open another trade before the pevious one is closed. In the pdf, you said that it is programmed so that it would not do this. Something to take a look at. Will let you know if I find anyhting else and on the performance. Best Regards Bradev

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Can some explain the floating, jumping stops in reference to BE pips, in other words what would u normally set them at to work, say it i had my TP 100, set my BE 25, and TS 20, would that mean the Stop would float up per 20 pips ??? Same as jumping stops please explain what to set them &amp; how they work thanks very much kev

--- 帖子 #455 ---
something that I forgot to mention in the manual... the EA will only start to trail after it has done the breakeven modification, regardless if you're using floating stop or jumping stop. the trail will not start unless the position has moved in your favor by BreakevenPips amt. as for exit. there's a few ways the EA will exit. either, the Stoploss level or TakeProfit level has reached... or a signal of the opposite direction has occurred. that may explain why it has closed early. btw, just curious, did this save you in that trade or did you get whipsawed by this feature?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
okok... I've just awoke so I'll answer this now. ok say you have these settings. TakeProfit = 100 BreakevenPips = 25 TrailingStop = 20 UseFloatingStop = true This will mean the EA will use floating stop after it has done the breakeven. lets assume you've opened a long position. the trailing doesn't start yet. it waits for the position to be in profit by +25pips, modify the position to breakeven. then the trail starts. floating trail means it will constantly move upwards (for a long) with the price seamlessly keeping a (e.g. 20 pips) distance. as the price moves up pip by pip, the stop moves up as well. when the price deteriorates, the stop holds its ground to secure your profit. when price moves back up again with over 20 pips distance from your stop, the stop level starts moving up again. This method is preferred by conservative traders. ok say you have these settings. TakeProfit = 100 BreakevenPips = 25 TrailingStop = 20 UseFloatingStop = false that means it will use Jumping stop. Again, I'll wait for the breakeven to kick in first. now jumping stop defers to floating stop in a way the stoploss level doesn't move seamlessly with the price but moves by leaps and bounds. ok so you have a long position. price moves +25, stoploss move to breakeven. but the stoploss level will hold at this breakeven level until the price has moved by +40 pips. then the stop will be moved (jumped) to +20. when price moved by +60, stop level jumps to +40. in other words the stop level will jump to 20 pips away from the price IF the price has moved twice that amt away (in your favor) from the stop level. This kinda trailing stop gives the position more free zone to move and you probably have a better chance of locking in more profits with less whipsaws... but then again, the stop only moves after the price has moved by 2 X trailing stop amt. that's quite a bit for the average trader to stomach. ok say you have these settings. TakeProfit = 100 BreakevenPips = 25 TrailingStop = 0 UseFloatingStop = true or false No trailing stop will be used. choice is up to you. good luck and good trading. =) regards, Zen

Hello. I started to test the EA on my VPS tonight, will let everyone know how it goes. Is it advisiable to use EA on 15 M chart?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Got it thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Well DB, i'm only testing it at the mo on demo, but TF15 will probably give you more trades, up to you personally what u want to use, i have heard others using the system not the EA on H1 &amp; other tf's as well Good luck, &amp; u should only demo it for now

--- 帖子 #461 ---
hah yeah dont worry i wouldnt dare use it live before demo. thanks for the info it is up and running now on my server

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hey Zen, just humor me a bit here, explain the periods you use in the entry &amp; exit buffers, it seems some of the trades are entering a tad late......... Thanks Kev

--- 帖子 #463 ---
To explain that better, we'll have to dwell into the codes a bit and that may take some time. Now I have to go out for a while. and will return to humor you a bit later. till then, feel free to post more questions. =) regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #465 ---
When you choose TP = 0, then trades are only closed when both MA and QQE cross in the opposite direction of your trade.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Ummm thanks, have u tried just setting a TP to see what it does ????

--- 帖子 #467 ---
yes, i did. gives worse results.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
No worries thanks

The QQE alert does not work , the metatrader writes: 2008.08.25 11:54:28 Cannot open file 'D:\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators\QQEA.ex4' on the USDCHF,M15 cam some one help?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
If you r using the EA u don't need it, its only the alert

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Zen, Thanks you very much for this wonderful work on the EA. I cannot appreciate you enough. All SSS traders, I hope we'll enjoy this wonderful help from Zen.I am currently tweaking with some of the EA settings and will post results when I am thru. Good Hunting to all.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
10x ...

--- 帖子 #473 ---
let's look at the codes a bit. Inserted Code bool EMA_SaysBuy() { bool shouldBuy = false; if (Get_EMA_Close_Value(SignalIndex) &gt; Get_EMA_Open_Value(SignalIndex)) { for (int i=SignalIndex+1; i&lt;SignalIndex+Entry_Signal_Buffer; i++) { if (Get_EMA_Close_Value(i) &lt; Get_EMA_Open_Value(i)) { shouldBuy = true; } } if (Entry_Signal_Buffer == 0) { shouldBuy = true; } } return (shouldBuy); } we'll assume you've set Wait_For_Candle_Close to "true". that means SignalIndex will be 1 (that's the previous candle). so the code reads like this... if the previous closed candle has EMA5 HIGHER than EMA8, it will then check if the "Entry_Signal_Buffer" number of bars (by default, 5) preceding that candle. if one of those candles have EMA5 LOWER than EMA8, that means there is a crossover within the buffer period. the same algorithm has been applied to QQE lines as well. in essence, this algorithm is good for 2 things. Firstly, to have a valid crossover in a time period of your choice. you wouldn't want to just look at EMA5 above EMA8 that's all. you'll also want to know how long has it been above. and not take the chance if its been there for too long. Secondly, you'll be able to restrict a valid signal as crossovers on different indicators within a buffer period instead of restricting them to be on the same candle. like in our case, a valid signal is when both the QQE and EMA crossovers happens within the Entry_Signal_Buffer number of candles. that way, you don't have to restrict them to occur on the same candle. hence the term, buffer. Inserted Code bool ShouldBuy() { if (EMA_SaysBuy() &amp;&amp; MomentumVT_SaysBuy() &amp;&amp; QQE_SaysBuy()) { return (true); } return (false); } as for entering a tad late... it has to do with our waiting for candle to close. so the earliest a trade can enter is at ONE candle AFTER the LATER crossover occurs (can be either the EMA or QQE, whichever comes later.) I hope I've explained this clearly. Its easier to understand if I draw a picture... but... I'm lazy. =p regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #474 ---
you're very much welcome, Wahnone. I enjoy every oppurtunity to work with people in FF and I see them as learning experiences. this EA is merely a prototype, like all programs, there's always a need for tweaks and bug fixes. do let me know if there's any you find. dear all, feel free to post suggestions on how to better this EA. I've just realised I forgot to code the comments on the top left corner like I used to. I should at least place a note there to inform the user if the EA is working or sleeping due to time defined. if there's other things you want me to add, do let me know thru here and drop me a PM so I can pop by for a look. have fun! and good pipping. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Thanks to Zen once again. Is anyone having luck with the EA settings? If you are, please share it with us...I am still yet to find suitable settings, but I have discovered a few mistakes in the EA which I will soon describe.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
hi all, when i load the EA, i get the following error: For GBP/USD pair, Daily HL GBP/USDm , H1; cannot resize the array Anyone can help?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I have the EA on 5 separate charts on the 15 minute time frame with two separate brokers. The only settings I changed were to trade 24 hours, and the take profit at 50. Nothing else was touched. On Interbank, While I was asleep, it opened some trades, and then would almost immediately start selling off .10 lots, splitting them from the trade. Also, itappeared it didn't take other valid signals. So, I manually entered trades on 3 pairs, and even though these were manual trades, the EA took over and started selling off partial .10 lots again at small losses. I've had to turn it off.On my WHC demo account, it took no trades at all with same pairs and same settings.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Entry pic attached. It looks ok, trade was executed on the open of next bar after the signal bar closed.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
you're probably using another EA. my EA doesn't do that. it either modify the stop loss or close the whole position completely. no split selling codes were in place. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Thanks for introducing what was originally a manual system. I lost interest after the words "expert" and "advisor" were introduced. Sadly this seems to happen to every thread on FF. So now the discussion is about coding rather than trading. Sigh...............

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I think this happens because the rules and parameters are pointed out so many times that it becomes redundunt and there's nothing left to do but build an ea. If the system proves to be successful, it is only natural to find the easiest way to execute it. Don't bash a thread for following the course of natural human behavior.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Mmmm..... So a few rules have been pointed out and you think that's what trading is all about do you? First stochs were in they they were out (unwisely in my opinion) No matter. Well let's see. We could have had more of a discussion on stops, maybe some backtesting on whether trading in the same direction as the H1 and H4 stochs gave better filtering. Perhaps whether the reverse cross of the stoch for exits instead of the 5/8 cross was safer although it netted fewer pips. What about pivots? The list goes on - but you have your EA based on a few simple rules that are now redundant. Priceless!!

--- 帖子 #483 ---
you're probably one of the many who was burnt by auto-trading. but an EA isn't always on pure auto-trading. My EAs are created with research as the main aim. to help find the best way and parameters to trade a system. I honestly don't believe you'll be able to constantly look at 10 pairs at the same time and try to find out what is best for each. with the help of EA, you can. key it in and let it run for you while you're busy with something else. check back the results later. if anyone chooses to trade live using the EA, its their choice. as for code explaination, it merely helps people understand what the EA is doing so they have a level of assurance. I don't enjoy using just the ex4 files supplied in some other threads cos I hate not knowing (but its the publisher's choice and I respect that), which is why I publish the mq4 codes as well. Knowledge is power. and my knowledge is for all. I don't care if people take my EAs and sell it on ebay or something. I believe karma will get them one day. I'm all for free speech, but please try and be constructive and not ruin this thread which is meant for sharing. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #484 ---
if you have suggestions on how to better the system, by all means, share it with the class. I can even add your suggestions into the EA for more thorough and efficient testing. let's not be all negative about it...

--- 帖子 #485 ---
This is the trade taken by my EA today. +96 pips

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Sorry if I sounded negative. That wasn't my intention. I just have strong feelings about this. I have never traded live with an EA because I couldn't sleep well not knowing how it might react to sudden changes in the market. Some see an advantage in allowing an EA to trade because it removes the emotions. We all know how emotion can effect trading decisions. But I also see it as a disadvantage precisely because of that. You need to have a feeling for the pulse of the market and manual trading works better in that respect. But your idea of using EA's to research the best settings rather than necessarily trading with it is a statement I haven't heard before and that's of interest.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Can you share it?I mean the EA.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Sure.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Zen, something weird has happened on EU. EA opened short per rules and then it opened long not per rules, without closing short. SS attached. Both trades are still open. Edit: Never mind, QQE on my chart had wrong setting, but problem still happened with trade not stop-and-reversing.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
does anybody has ever use it on a diffrernt time frame??? lie 1h 4h or maybr daily or weekly??

My results with the EA since last night: Eur/Jpy: -4 pips, -34 pips, +74 pips Usd/Jpy: -33 pips Gbp/Usd: -25 pips My settings are default except for HourstoTrade = 24 SignalBuffer = 4 ExitBuffer = 4 FloatingStop = False Looking forward to other's settings and results Thanks again Zen for the work on the ea

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I'm using the Template on the 30 min chart on my demo account and I love it. I only changed the color and size of the arrows to make it easier for me to see. I've also been running Zen's SSS v1 for about the last 12 hours with default settings and it's failed to make any trades. Yes, I told it to go live (it's just a demo account after all). I'm Central Time in the US, but kept the GMT at 7 since -5 isn't valid . Here is a screen shot, any ideas? Also, I think this screen shot points out just how well this system works. I'm shocked at it's simplicity and effectiveness. Thank you to everyone in the thread for continuing to tweak this system (even if some don't like the coding aspect )

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Thanks, I'm going to give this a look. I'm an former developer, new to the ForEx and I love this aspect about MT4.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Got it thankyou

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Zen, another quick ????..............do we have to have any indicators loaded up on our charts or in our MT4 platform if we don't have to have them on the charts, for this EA to work thanks

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Results on TF15, default settings so far................... EU -23 pips GU -34pips EJ -5 pips, -31, +56 pips UJ -30 pips UC for some reason still not taken a trade Kev

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Zen_Leon, I tested SSS_EA_ver1.mq4. BreakEvenPips and TrailingStop don't work. I think the "OrderModify" codes should be changed. Can someone check these codes?

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Krux, As with any ea I have used, the indicators do not have to be on your charts, but have to be available in the experts/indicators folder. I am sure Zen will inform us if I am wrong, but I don't think I am.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Thanks Wahnone for the system. I traded it today using the demo and made some pips in the process. I live in the US so its a shame that the good pairs does most of the moving overnight. I like the prospect of the EA and I'm really looking forward to when it is finished. I use the 1hr, 4hr and ocasionally the 30 min. I like the longer time frame the best. Larger moves, market news doesn't effect the trend too much and you don't have to stare at the screen all day(night). Is there a way to have a 2 hr and 8 hr chart on metatrader?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
alright, I'll look into it. most probably its the logic within Update_Status() function that's the problem. will post up the amendments once done.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Statement so far since the middle of London session. Not bad. Zen, if you get a chance, please take a look at why the trades didn't stop and reverse per signals. I had both short and long on EU open.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
My EA is having glitches. I think if you have other EAs, they somehow interfere with opening trades. I also had a split off problem, and the split off referenced the same magic number as the EA. In any event, the system itself performs well manually. For us folks in the U.S., would be fantastic to have an EA that would work after midnight. Zen, people do steal EAs and indicators. I've seen it. There's one guy on these boards that sells indicators for a "donation". He has thousands of indicators. He goes by several names. he changes the indicator very slightly to skirt the legalities, and then says he "improved" it, and calls it his own. Some here know who this guy is. But, you're right. You have to live with yourself and karma will get you. thanks for doing what you do.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
There is a way to have a 2hr and an 8hr chart. Pull down the scripts from the navigator, scroll to period converter, drag it to the screen you wish the new chart to update from and select time frame. Then you go to file, drop down to open offline, scroll down to the TF you just created, double click it and it should pull up the chart. Now there are a few things you need checked before the new chart will update as a live chart. When it asks for the options you want on the chart, ie TF, you must check allow live trading and allow DDL imports from the inputs tab. Then go to tools from the toolbar, options, expert advisors and allow DLL imports. I don't really use this feature all that much so i hope this gets you what you want.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I realised I should've named the first EA post as beta 1 since this is really still in the beta testing period. so here's beta 2. Inserted Code What's new in beta 2? ===================== 1. separate entry and exit signal buffers for EMA and QQE. 2. Fixed logic error in Update_Status() which didn't work when there's only one trade in play. (breakeven and trailing stop should work now) 3. Fixed minor errors in Update_Status(), should use MODE_ASK instead of MODE_BID when closing a sell position. 4. Fixed logic errors which didn't allow trailing stop when BreakevenPip was set to 0. 5. Fixed bug which cause opening in opposite direction when there's already a trade running. 6. Added additional comments on top left corner of chart. the reason I separate the signal buffers for EMA and QQE was after seeing how taravolta's EA caught a trade that my EA missed. I realised that was due to the signal buffer and my EA's persistence on checking for crossovers in both EMA and QQE. if I'm not wrong, taravolta's EA doesn't look for crossovers in the QQE, instead, it simply checks if the solid line is above or below the dotted line. this is probably a good idea. so I've allowed this in this beta. if you only care about above or below and not about crossover, you can set "QQE_Entry_Signal_Buffer" to 0. and now that I've separate the 2 signal buffers, you can check for crossover in one and not the other. have fun. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #505 ---
thanks for that. I want to trade to where any market news won't effect my trading. I also want to confirm the trend

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Thanks again Zen on test now

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Thanks again Zen, testing the new one. I love how you added the option to not require a 'cross' for the qqe, I have noticed alot of trades that passed because everything lined up but the qqe didnt 'cross' was already in the correction position, and also noticed the qqe coming up and touching, then dropping again which also caused a non triggered trade. This will help alot! On another note, for your later updates (if there are any) I notice the comment on the trade saying SSS_Buy(magic#) even though the actual trade is a sell. Just a nitpick thing for the list of non priority fixes maybe First trade already with beta2 and is well into profit, thanks man!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
aw.. that's a copy and paste error on my part.. this is embarassing... haha. yep. will make the changes on the next amendment. Thanks for that. meanwhile feel free to post more suggestions on how to better the EA and system. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Just to show you a short trade that just opened on EU Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looks very late in opening. Don't worry about the other ones i closed them manually so i could put the beta 2 version on

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Tks for that taz

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Also testing Beta 2 along side of SS. EURUSD and GBPUSD with both EA's, all on the M15 chart. So far, SS is the only one making the trades. I'll post comparative charts later on Tuesday.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Umm had a very strange thing happen the EA just bought in the GU &amp; EU &amp; made a sell in UC all at the exact same time, and then all hit there SL at exactly the same time... weird at i'm not using any other EA'S at all

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Are you using unique numbers for each one?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Certainly am I double checked that

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Well, I guess I'm having issues too, mine won't even make trades. The other EA posted a few pages back as 'SS' works just fine. Really kind of odd.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I had just installed new versions about not too long ago and all pairs opened trades almost at the same time as well. However, signals on all were still valid it looks like. Will have to observe as next signals come if this will occur again. Im running mine with 40 pip stop loss althou to test if the EA is closing and opening positions correctly based on signals i probably should run it without SL, TS and TP, just for testing purposes. 1st version was not closing trades on oposite signal, it was just opening new trade leaving original running to hit SL. Good news is that overall even with few bugs and swapping out versions, EA is still profitable. I think Zen made a great job and i think once polished this EA should be a profitable performer.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Yeah good thinking about takin out SL, TS, just to see if it does exit a trade on opp sig....i have now made a few profitable trades which have hit my TS, so i might take them out also &amp; see how it goes, but the other 3 trades that all opened &amp; closed at the same time lost about 90 pips

--- 帖子 #518 ---
That is odd, i'm using TF15 &amp; mine is definitely trading, currently have 3 open trades GU, EU, &amp; UC, one closed + 13 pips hit TS

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I see you have QQE indicator set to "5". can you change your QQE indicator setting to "1" like how Wahnone stated? then post the new chart. and what time did you run the EA?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Unfortunately i deleted &amp; cleared the chart sorry......so my QQE Indy setting should be 1, i downloaded the zip file with the indys that Wahnone has on the first page, or is this to just check what would of happened...............????

yes the QQE indi has its default value at 5. Wahnone wants it at 1. so I set 1 as the default in the EA. you can't get a good comparison visually and EA-ly (I coin this word. haha) if the settings aren't the same. so the EA's "QQE_Smooth_Factor" value and the QQE Indi's "SF" value must be the same for a proper comparison between the chart and the EA. although the EA doesn't need the indicators to be loaded onto the chart to work, its still good to have them on screen for visual purposes and seeing if the EA is working properly. you might also wanna try setting "QQE_Entry_Signal_Buffer" to 0. this will tell the EA not to search for crossovers in QQE which may make u miss some trades. regards, Zen

Zen, The breakeven, stoploss, trailing stop and take profit are now working well on the EA beta2. The only issue I see now is the way the EA take the trades. It enters earlier than the setup at times and later at other times. It took a buy trade on gbpusd 1min(for testing only), the trade should have gone all the way up, but the EA exited it midway without any exit signal. Please, could this be corrected? I have attached the chart. The settings used are default except from the QQE_Entry_buffer, QQE_Exit_buffer, MA_Entry_buffer, and MA_Exit_buffer, all set at zero.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I installed the beta 2 EA 3 hours ago on 5 different pairs on the 15 minute charts, and very happy with the results. Nothing at all changed except to trade 24 hours. GBP/USD plus 15 USD/CHF plus 37 EUR/JPY Plus 26 EUR/JPY Minus 36 EUR/JPY Plus 9 (I manually traded out for reasons I forget now. It's plus 90 as I write!) Love the stop loss feature. Great start!

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Me too .. i installed the EA beta 2 n put on 15M TF ... .results as follows GBPUSD +15 EURUSD +25 EURJPY -28 USDJPY +31 USDCHF +38 USDCAD +100 .... great work guys !

I have the opposite problem. SS is not taking any trades on my charts. SSEA beta2 has taken 2 on EU and both at profit. Both exited with TS. Hello all. Hope to contribute here.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
It works on USD/CAD too, and for a hundred smackers no less!? Pinch me, someone. I'm ready to quit my day job! Just kidding, of course (sort of) Thanks to Wahnone and Zen for a great start!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Please where can I find the EA?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
For those that the EA isn't taking trades, you should post a chart or two as mine has taken SO many trades since last night I can barely count them The only settings I changed were: trade 24 hours ema entry and exit signal buffers set to 5 qqe entry signal buffer set to 0 usefloatingstop set to false Zen also added in the upper left corner a status of the ea, whether it's sleeping or taking trades etc.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Has any body done any back testing using the ea with good quaility and had good results?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Wahnone, would you mind checking your trade history under the comments column. does the trade that "exit early" have [sl] at the end? if so then its probably cos it hit the trailing stop. if you want it to go all the way until an opposite signal appears, you might wanna disable trailing stop by setting "TrailingStop" value to 0.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
the latest beta2 version of the EA is here http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=504 there's a pdf manual created for the first version too. you can find it in the attachment list (paperclip image at the top right). I'll create an updated manual for beta2 when I find the time.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Here are the two charts in comparison. First, the SS chart, then the SSE Beta 2 chart. I'm sure there is a setting I have set wrong somewhere.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Well at the mo your beta 2 is sleeping (LH upper corner) if you want it to trade 24 hrs set it to 24 in hours to trade

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Yeah, I had it set to 10 hours and at the time I took the shot, I was outside of that time period. Quick question. I have a sneaky feeling that I may have the wrong settings for my GMT. I'm in the central US with a GMT of -6 (and the system only accepts 0 - 24), and my broker is in NYC so GMT -5. What should the GMT setting be in the SSE Beta 2?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Recommended trading hours are between 0700 gmt and 1700 gmt, so if your broker time is -5 gmt, then u'd be setting your ea to start time of 2 and 10 hours. Your broker time is probably not your local time, so check what it is in comparison to gmt and adjust accordingly. for testing purposes, just set the ea to start at 0 and run 24 hrs. Edit: Zen may want to verify that the EA is taking the time from the broker, which I believe to be the case (typical for ea's to get time info from the mt4 platform broker)

--- 帖子 #536 ---
yes, time to start is dependent on the timezone your broker is using and not according to your computer's time. mine for example, IBFX uses GMT clean and simple. but I'm in Singapore with timezone GMT +8. I don't care about my timezone. All I need to know is the broker's. if yours is on something else like GMT -4, EST, or whatever.., you'll need to calculate the offset and reflect the changes. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #537 ---
How does the QQEA alert work? I am getting down arrow while price is above the EMA, Momentum is above the zero line,..... and vice versa. The arrows are not always pointing the right way. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Zen, I am using IBFX, so what is the GMT setting? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I think he said ibfx is gmt, but just check the current time on ibfx and compare to gmt time to find out. FXDD is gmt -2, i haven't used ibfx for awhile so can't answer you on that one, easy to figure it out tho.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Does the EA maybe not work with some brokers? Works fine on Interbank FX. But, doesn't take any trades at all with Alpari or WHC. I also have an ODL and FXDD account I could try it on, but I don't really use them much. Anyone else having trouble getting the EA to work on certain brokers accounts?

--- 帖子 #541 ---
ok. forgive me for being a noob, but is the face suppose to be smiling or frowning for the EA? Mine is frowning right now, but it says it is still working. I'm using beta2 thanks

--- 帖子 #542 ---
OK, thanks I got it.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Frown means that it's not live trading. Click on the frown and then click on 'Common' tab then make sure there is a check in the 'Allow Live Trading' check box. That will turn that frown upside down

--- 帖子 #544 ---
right, I do programming as a living and deeply appreciate open source efforts of any kind. I am weary of any one person who claims to have all the answers Am trying both EAs now on my VPS will let you know how it goes good luck all

I think he has, he said he has changed nothing except for trading 24 hrs

--- 帖子 #548 ---
All i can suggest is remove your SS one, and try only the beta 2,on your platform, are you using it on the same platform but diff charts ??

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Just want to be sure because the default lot size is 200 which is rather high for demo or retailers.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Correct. I have two EU and two GU charts open. One of each runs SSE and one of each runs SS. Neither runs both at the same time. Also, I have unique magic numbers for each of the two SSE's 'just in case'. I'll try running 1 chart with SSE and nothing else on the other charts and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Of course, make sure the beta2 ea has not only diff magic numbers for every pair you have it set on, but also make sure those numbers are different than the beta1 numbers as well. You probably already checked that however. You also have your MA cross set to allow 5 bars to line up with the qqe and momentum to trigger the trade, but you have your qqe set to only allow 1 bar. So basically, in order to enter a trade, you will need to have all 3 of your indicators happen within 1 bar to trigger an entry trade (i believe). Because of the qqe entry buffer setting you chose.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
tazman, that's rather incorrect. let me explain again. the reason why I separate QQE entry buffer and EMA entry buffer was precisely to not be restricted by what you stated. think of the indicators separately. so if say I have EMA_Entry_Buffer set to 5, it only means EMA signal is valid if there is a cross over that happened within 5 bars before this signal bar. then I have QQE_Entry_Buffer set to 2. means the QQE signal is valid if there's a crossover between the QQE solid line and dotted line within 2 bars before the signal bar. when both signal valid and MomentumVT is valid, enter a trade. and if you set any of the buffer to 0, it will merely check whether its above or below for that particular indicator, and dun care about crossovers. so you see, the signal buffers can be set with different values. In fact, I'll encourage this, if not I wouldn't have incorporated such a feature. regards, Zen

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Guys, for those of you who aren't making trades with my EA, can you take a look at the "journal" tab or "expert" tab below to see if there's any error messages? post them here so I can debug or probably come up with an answer. One more thing. can I just confirm if you've read the pdf manual I posted with the first EA? you need to read this in order to know how to make use of the settings. if you've read it, you should see this... LotsDecimalAllowed = 2 If your broker only lets you get as low as mini lots and not to micro, set this to 1. if your client isn't making trades with my EA, my best guess is you've not changed this setting to 1. e.g. of mini lot is 0.1 e.g. of micro lot is 0.01 any lot size that needs the 2nd decimal place requires the broker to have micro lot support. Let's say your broker can only go as low as mini and not micro. and the EA's MoneyManagement algorithm calculated a lot size of 0.32. and the program sends a trade using this lot size. it will be rejected by the broker's server cos of the 0.02 which it doesn't allow. if you've set the setting to 1, the EA will round up the lot size to 1 decimal point. 0.3, and submit this instead which should go through. I will write a more in depth manual for the coming versions but there's no point in me writing it if they aren't read and followed... regards, Zen p.s., I think Alpari don't accept micro lots, so the LotsDecimalAllowed setting should be set to 1. InterbankFX allows micro lots so the default setting is ok for IBFX customers.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hey Zen, Thanks for the follow up on that, but I guess I am still not quite grasping it correctly. If you have the qqe signal buffer set to 2, the ea still wont take a trade unless all 3 indicators line up within 2 bars in my mind at least. This is due to the fact that the momentum and the qqe now need to be within two bars in order to trigger the trade. Yes, I understand that the ema cross doesn't have to be within two bars, but the other two will still need to be won't they? In any case, I was just trying to help him figure out why he might not be getting trades triggered, since he seemed to be having a problem. I have kept myself from being confused about that feature in my own testing, simply because I set the QQE buffer to 0, so I don't need a cross to happen at all to enter a trade, it just needs to be in the correct location (over or under dotted line). Let's use this as an example: we have ema enter buffer set to 5, and qqe enter buffer set to 2 In this example we are going short lets say the ema crossed 5 bars ago Lets say qqe just crossed in the latest bar If momentum is still not under 0 we wont get a sell trade yet if momentum does not cross under for another 3 bars, we are now passed our 2 bar buffer for qqe signal correct? so no trade will occur now. also, the ema buffer was set to 5, so we are passed the 5 bars as well for the ema, so no trade would occur because of that also. Anyhow, this could be way too much overkill, because I do believe I understand how you have coded this and in all of my trades thus far they all seem to jive just fine. But I do believe there would be instances where people might be thinking the ea isnt taking trades when it should, but it's based on what settings they put in for these entry buffers. All I was getting at. Sorry to confuse things more

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Fixed it. It was looking for the QQE indicator to be called QQE.ex4 So, all I had to do was rename one of my QQE indicators and like magic, it started working. On a related note, using default settings, I ran it in the tester using EU on a 4 hour chart from July/2006 to 8/25/08 and it came out rather poorly. But I got her working! I'm going to test with a few different charts and settings to try to optimize it.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Ah yes, sorry I should have mentioned that also, as I had to the same thing. renamed qqea.ex4 to qqe.ex4, as it was flooding the log, was kinda hard to miss for me. Glad you got it sorted out.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
The funny thing is, I saw that and I saw a post a while back that mentioned it as well. Somehow, I interpreted the post to say 'don't worry about it'. It wasn't until I ran the tester that it hit home.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hello guys. The ea took of the rest of the trades out almost perfectly yesterday, only error I noticed while testing on 1 min as been resolved, thanks to zen. I got similar results with those posted by paradoxical and reddevilpin. Still doing the optimization for the EA. I will release the best settings as soon as it has finished. Good hunting to all.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thanks Wahnone, getting some good, some not so good results on TF15, thinking of trying diff TF's, only trying 3 pairs at the mo.....will be very interested to see your settings..........

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Only changes I made to the EA are to trade 24 hours and set the entry signal buffer to zero. Everything else left as is. Trading 5 pairs. Interesting that all of the 5 trades made before 7:00 GMT (which is midnight PST), were stopped out at losses. The ones made after that. The ones made and closed after 7:00 GMT are plus 47 pips. There were two losers on EUR/JPY totalling 68 pips included. Also, the 20 pip trailing stop worked perfectly. Have 3 open trades at +29 pips. Will keep the testing going. Seems Wahnone was correct to not do any trades until 7:00 GMT, as all the trades the EA made before then were losers. EA also seems to be working fine. Have to figure out why is only works on my Interbank demo. Maybe because I don't have all of the correct indicators in the other demo accounts with Alpari and WHC?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
argh... does anyone read my long posts at all? READ READ READ!!!!! haha..

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Soory, Zen. I didn't read that post closely enough. Also, my title on my previous post was incorrect. I looked at the closing of a trade and thought the EA closed it incorrectly. But, the EA closed it correctly at the 20 pip trailing stop from it's previoue high point. That'll teach me to post before I've had my second cup of coffee! VERY, VERY nice EA

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Nice to hear that it is working properly on the demo micro accounts for you. Thanks for posting your testing results. It is helpful to hear how you are doing with it. I'm looking forward to testing it out for myself too. PD

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Config: QQE entry 0 HoursToTrade: 24 Symbol: GBPUSD 4 x stoploss. 1 x alert stop (-6pips). And two profitable +20 +128. Because of the last bigone, it gave everything a +9. I sat the config to QQE entry 5, and we'll se how it works out.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
The EA performed without any glitches that I can see. In hindsight, if I eliminated the 20 PIP trailing stop, I would have made even much better gains. For instance, was stopped out on GBP/USD for +35 pips at 1.8400, on the 20 PIP trailing stop, and it's now at 1.8314, which would be an additional 86 PIPS. Similar with EUR and USD/JPY. Therefore, have taken off the trailing stop loss. When I have time, will get another demo and run with trail stop to compare the results. Most likely, the much better results without a 20 PIP trail stop occur only in trending markets. Would like to see what the results are with and without. Also, looks like earlier entries would make quite a bit more PIPS, so I've set the "Wait_For_Candle_Close" to False. In looking at the charts, the CCI 8 and MOM was at entry points a candle before. Will see what tomorrow brings after these settings changes.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hello guys. After some manual backtest, I saw that the main problem with this system is the way it exits the trades. I want you to suggest better exit strategies that can enhance the system. Looking forward to your replies.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
This is a crazy question, if it can be answered then it would be the Holy Grail..... How can one determine if the conditions are met for an entry that there will be enough momentum to drive the price further? If one waits for the crossing of the MAs or any of the other lagging indicators, one can potentially be in a losing position. I know that many systems are also based upon the time of day one trades, this may be true, but what if that time is not possible. As to when to exit, I would use dynamic support/resistance, and it is always possible that it can go further.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks. I am not concerned about the entry, only the exits give me a concern. You know, in a ranging market, you are bound to fall into a lot of whipsaws, and this system is at its most vulnerable at that time. I wouldn't like letting a winning trade change over and turn to a losing one all in the name of waiting for an exit signal. More suggestions pls...

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Perhaps if we took a look at the larger trend. For example, if the hourly trend or daily trend was going down, then if the EA may be more likely to exit out of a long with 1 indicator crossing down instead of multiple indicators. And visa versa.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I have been backtesting so many various tweaks that my eyes are going . Still have not found a good exit with what indi's the EA uses, going to try some more tonight (oz time) been limited for spare time. So Wahnone if you're not concerned about the entry are your entry settings default ??? Just asking so we can get that out of the way and concentrate on exits more thanks again

--- 帖子 #571 ---
well, i lost 30 pips today. i need to find a way to time my entries better. It needs to be earlier. Its like time i get in it starts to reverse on me.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
how can i move the arrows over to give earlier entry? I already set it to 1. It doesn't seem to move from 5 to 1 for the qqe sf. what am i'm doing wrong? i think also the momentum set to 5 gives earlier signals thanks

--- 帖子 #573 ---
ok i made some changes and it seems to work much better now. sorry for the repeated posts. just me thinking out loud. the new settings look good for the 15 min time frame. much better entry.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Wahnone, first thank you for this interesting system. I have been trading it merely from this monday on, last weekend I've been backtesting it excessively. The last three days it has given me good profit, and of course a few losses. I'm, trading on 1h timeframe. I'm basically entering with two increments with a 40 sl and with the first increment 40 tp,(1) second 80 tp(2). If tp(1) is hit I move the second increment to breakeven and wait for the second increment to hit tp(2). Of course sl is according to the chart. Most of the time it is 40 pips. If the market appears to be in random moves I tighten the sl to breakeven as soon as the trade is in 20+ field. From here on I'd use a trailing stop of 20. If market appears to be in rhythm I'd use a trailing stop of 40 or wait for tp(2) to be hit. Since I'm very much inclined to Philip Nel's 4hmacd strategy I try to take trades as trend continuations, according to market rhythm rules. That means I don't take every trade that the indicators offer. Anyway, I just traded for the last three days, but this is how I've found it to make sense and pips to me. Thanks again for sharing. Regards ashes

--- 帖子 #575 ---
it's very nice. thank you!

Please be so kind to inform us, are you manual trading the SSS, or using the EA Beta 2......also which pairs &amp; if auto trading what parameters are you using thanks

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hey, After trying various settings for the last 48 hrs or so, my system still cannot pick up any trades. Can someone whose system is doing OK now, post a complete set of indicators used, template, and complete settings on the EA including trading lots. BTW, I am using IBFX for demoing. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Sure, let me help since I've had the same issues. * Make sure you are running MetaTrader 4. This should be obvious but just in case others need the help. * Download the SSS.zip file I posted. In it, you will find the following files: 1. Dinapoli stoch.ex4 2. Heiken Ashi.ex4 3. MomentumVT.ex4 4. QQE.ex4 5. SSS_EA_beta2.mq4 6. simple stupid template.tpl * Put file numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 in your C:\Program Files\MetaTrader\experts\indicators folder. It's possible and probable that your MetaTrader folder is called something else like \MetaTrader4 - Awesome Broker\ * Put file number 5 (the SSE beta) in C:\Program Files\MetaTrader\experts folder. * Put file number 6 (the template) in C:\Program Files\MetaTrader\templates folder. * If MetaTrader 4 is already open, close it. * Now open up MetaTrader4. * Make sure you have no other EA running right now. * Click on 'Expert Advisors' button on the top tool bar so that it has a small green circle with a white arrow pointing to the right in it. This is the 'ON' button. * Click on the window you want to use SSE on. * Go to the left hand side under 'Navigator' and find 'Expert Advisors'. Under this, you will see SSE_EA_beta2. Double Click on this. * The SSE_EA_beta2 options open up. Under the 'Common' tab, make sure there is a check mark on the box 'Allow Live Trading' WARING: this will allow live trading. DON'T DO THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE TESTED THIS SYSTEM. * Click on the Inputs tab. Make sure the iOpenHour tab is set to how you want it. Then click OK * You should see the SSE_EA_beta2 written in the upper right hand corner of the window with a little smiley face. The smile lets you know that the EA is live. If you have set your iOpenHour to be running right now, you will see 'EA working (looking for signals)' on the upper left side of the Window. If not, it will say 'EA Sleeping (but still managing opened trades if any)'. This means that the market is not open according to your iOpenHour setting. BONUS: If you want the cool template to do the work on your own or to see what SSE sees, make sure you click on the monitary window you want to use it on, Then click on 'CHARTS - TEMPLATE - Simple Stupid Template'. This template is NOT nessesary to run the EA, but some like to use it. I hope this helps, please let me know. PS: if you feel uncomfortable grabbing my zip (I made it with a mac after all ) then go to page 1 and grab the originals and rename 'QQE Alert v3.ex4' to 'QQE.ex4' Also, if you have any more issues, make sure that your broker allows micro lots. If not, adjust the LotsDecimalAllowed under the properties for SSE_EA_beta2. the default is 2 which means 0.00. That is a micro lot. If all you have is mini, you will need it to be 1 which is 0.0. Any more issues, look at your Journal tab at the bottom and post what it says here. -Tom

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Good system Wahnone. Has anybody tested whether it is better to take trades when the mavs cross at the same time as the QQE? From my observations {Casual} it seems to be that way.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Shaping up to be a decent session this evening on usd/jpy, usd/chf, gbp/jpy and eur/jpy (all in profit at the moment). The one adjustment I looked into after it was mentioned here by someone was changing the momentum to 5 instead of 10. At brief glance seems to make a decent difference (on m30 charts). so right now, i have all signal buffers set to 5 except qqe entry buffer which is set to 0. We'll see how it ends up after a few days.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Nice job FrostCall Just one side note. I know on my mt4 system, the template actually needs to go into the \MetaTrader\templates folder, not in the \Metatrader\experts\templates folder in order for it to appear in my template dropdown list when right clicking. If it is not located there, I have to go thru the trouble to choose 'load template' and search for its actual location on the pc. Just figured i'd throw that in, in case it causes someone a problem.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hey Tom, Great explanation and it is fully operational now. My stupid mistake is that I forgot to click the Expert Advisor button and was test running it with a red cross on this button. Now I have a big smile on the smiley on the right hand corner and the EA looking for signal on the left. Once again thanks mate.

Hello Everyone, I am new to Forex, I just finished reading all of babypips. I understood all of it. The problem I ran into was coming up with a system, i have no clue to start. I will definitely check this one out. I have never traded forex before and I am relatively new to trading any market. Wahnone, is there a reason why you trade 5GMT to 19GMT? This seems to be the asian/london and crossing over to US. I start classes soon and I don't know if i can trade this late. Thanks

Those are the best so far. it takes so long to optomize this thing. i set the model to open prices only just to make it faster. then once finished i set input parameters for best results then changed model to every tick and recalculated. this isn't the best way but it is the fastest. In optomizing i had something like 10900 different senarios testing so it would take like 5 days just to optomize with opening prices only and like 30 days to optomize with every tick. those results are from open prices only and i had only gone through about 2500 scenarios there were still 8000 or so to go but got impatient

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I don't see the MTF_v5 in the files. Should I be using the SSSbeta 2 or the SSS version 1 EA. Thanks again, cwave

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hey SSS beta 2 buddie

I must be doing something wrong I can't get it to generate maybe I have something wrong in the settings??? cwave

IMO, risk of 5% is too much since the Max DD is 58%. I wouldn't want to see anymore than 30% DD. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #604 ---
i couldn't agree more. as long as dd is 15% or under im ok. that is why i say more opt is needed. just takes forever

--- 帖子 #605 ---
i'm trading manually,i think that is the best thing to do

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Try going through the steps in this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=580

--- 帖子 #607 ---
I am beginning to agree more and more with that statement!!!

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Without some more complicated programing, manual trading using this system will be preferable to many. That of course is because some like to look at major trends or other indicators before using this or any other system. I personally love EA's because they can help you tweak a system and test it out quickly, removing all emotion and human error. The EA is not bias and doesn't make excuses. I feel they are an invaluable tool. But they are still a tool, not a magic pill and I don't see any honest EA creators that claim they are a magic pill. That being said, I love this system and I love the EA.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I agree with you, frost call. I changed some settings on the ea last night. The entry buffer at zero, and false on waiting for candle close. And no trail stop. A very choppy night, and lost many trades. When I woke up at 5:00 AM PST, I was able to watch it. Didn't change the settings at all, and all the trades were winners because the market had momentum. But, I manually traded out of all of them. I have to play around with the EA for the best settings. If I were to use it unattended, would have it on the more conservative settings with a 20 pip trailing stop. I think the EA is sometimes a little late on the entries. If I'm here and see things lining up (Mom, CCI8 and 5,3,3 stoch), I can manually enter trades. For now, the EA is great and so are the indicators to alert you when a trade might be there. Will most likely start making live trades next week, as I think I have the rules downnow with the help of the idnicators and EA. I like the PSAR too as an additional visual aid.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
The EA obviously catches trades late but i am still tightning the buffers and disabled candle close to see if it would help. It also can't be used except during the London &amp; US markets as the market trends more during those periods. But if i am correct; this system was originally built with Stoch Dinapoli which was not included or considered in the EA. Please could anyone tellme the reason?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hey Femzy......Quote from post # 266 by Wahnone " Since the Dinapoli Stoch is just there for re-entry, I removed it and replaced it with the Laguerre indicator" I think he did'nt believe it was necessary, i maybe wrong

--- 帖子 #612 ---
But Kru; if you read on l8r in the thread; if i ca remember he said he had to do away with Laguerre for some reasons.So i believe that shouldn't come up here too. But i might just check through previous posts now.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Could someone please explain to me what the EA or Expert Advisor does? I am guessing it places auto trades for you? I am still on page 7 of this thread....

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Correct its a 24hr robot

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Sure, an Expert Advisor can do many things. MT4 basically allows a great amount of customization in the form of mini programs. These take the form of Indicators, Scripts and Expert Advisors. The EA can be programed to do a lot of things, ranging from giving you a signal that says 'BUY NOW!!' to automatically placing trades for you. EA's are useful for people who know exactly how they want their system to work and want to take the Human error out of the equation. However, EA's do exactly what they are programed to do. Because of this, they will often miss a buy or sell that you may have made for reasons that it's not programmed to anticipate. Example: You see a huge downward trend in the market for the hourly, weekly and monthly chart of a currency pair. The 15 minute chart is trending up. You're watching the news and see that some bad report just came out and your sure the trend will go back down so you sell (or go short). The EA you are using might only be looking at the 15min chart so it thinks that the market is trending up when in reality, it's going down. This is why we all say to tweak your EA's and know when a good time to use them is. Any given EA may be better suited to a paticular currency pair, or to a Bull or Bear market. If you are not currently in a condition that the EA thrives in, you have a good chance of loosing money. In short, the EA is a tool. The best 'Expert Advisor' out there is YOU (given that you have put the time and effort into learning the market and it's ways). No EA will make you a millionare. You should not go live with an EA until you have tested it and tweaked it and understood it's interworkings for a long time. (Did I give enough disclaimers?)

--- 帖子 #616 ---
You did, a bit sharper than my post frosty

--- 帖子 #617 ---
On a related note, I will say that SSE_EA (both versions) seem to be major resource hogs compared to other EA's.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Looks like the EA, SSS_EA_beta2, missed a trade on EURJPY today @ 07:30 GMT. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Yeah too right i wasnt on EJ, but thats a good 120 + pip trade their

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Yeah you are correct guys. But from my observation for the past 2 days; the EA is doing great as a good 15-20 pip scalper on the M5 tf. Its prob with entry is that is damn late. Still tweaking though... Wanna hear your views too guys.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Thanks Frost, Great warning and explanation for everyone to read... especially newbies. (And aren't we all noobs to some extent?) This EA and this trading strategy is a very good one, I believe. But if it is designed to duplicate the manual trading strategy then I also doubt it will prove to be profitable -- if -- all you do is turn it on and let it trade for you without using any discretion. However, if you have enough judgement and experience to know when to stay out of choppy, ranging market conditions then it could be a very useful tool. I'll admit, many times I can't tell what will be a ranging day or trending until it's late in the game. I'm not trying to criticize or be discouraging, I'm just saying that I have been using the manual strategy since the beginning and have had some very profitable days when there are good smooth swings in one direction for several hours duration. And some days where they were very choppy, like yesterday that would have shot several days profit if you just kept getting in and out, in and out, blindly, like an EA would do. Again, not to sound negative, but what do we do to find a way to avoid the whipsaws but enjoy the sustained moves that are obviously where the profit is from this method? Just wanted to post my concerns and see if anyone else had any thoughts on that idea either. Thanks

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Yeah i do agree with your post, an EA will do your emotional trading for you and thats why they r good to have but.......and a biggggg buttt... you still have to oversee it especially in its infancy imho

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Does the first post have the most current and up-to-date rules for trading this system?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I suggest to use a stoch crossover as exit because ema seems to be too slow. I did some paper trades that way and it worked fine ...

--- 帖子 #625 ---
My Test looks like it is a Trending strategy but I dont have solutions for the case when the market is in range, I would then trade a range strategie but I dont have a range strategy, if some one have a range strategie and knows about this strategie enough and want to work with me togehter than I can build a EA Programm for us, the EA´s that I see here dont work correct like I see.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi Heino, To detect range/sideways market, u can employ envelope on your TF15 chart. I use Envelopes (32, Exponential, Close, Deviation 0.05). I also attach EMA32 (Close) to make it sit in the middle of the envelopes. If candles/bar are within the envelopes, it is a ranging market. Hope it could help u out. ~Profi~

--- 帖子 #627 ---
hi, i first of all say a big thanks to Wahnone &amp; Zen and every other one that has posted some positive for this thread. i think we need to add another indicator to avoid whipsaw &amp; fine tune our exit. Stoch 21-9-9 will be of great help. I personaly use it to exit my trades and it is working just fine. I also avoid to trade when a setup comes up but it is against the Stoch direction (just wait 1 candle or 2 for the stoch to cross), or the two Stoch lines are "romancing" without any clear direction. But if you happen to take the trade against the Stoch, just lock in 15-20 pips and tight your stoploss. If everybody agrees with it after testing i think Zen can add to the EA so that we compare the results. So basicaly what i mean is this. BUY: setup Ok and Stoch_main&gt;Stoch_signal SELL: Setup Ok and Stoch_main&lt;Stoch_signal EXIT Buy: Stoch cross down EXIT Sell: Stoch cross up Thanks &amp; may the pips be with you "Success is not an event, it is a process"

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hello Profi, that looks usefull I will test it and tell you then the results. regards Heino

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi Hi, my test with the envelopes where not so good because I need some better ruels when I can aktivate the trading of it, when I can say now it´s a range market. Because of that I am searching know for a indikator or some indikator that can say me know it ist range market and know it is trend market, then if I have find a good solution with indikators to can say this two zenarios, then I would aktivate one strategy for range market and in trend market I would aktivate the simpel system strategie. I have build a test EA and give you here all for download, it is a test Version but I think it makes it work. There are some settings in the EA but I think and hope everybody knows what they means, you can aktivate also just one Indikator or more. Know I hope I can find here some people or just one with that I can make this EA a bit profitabel, so that it dont loose much money in ranging market and some good settings for trend market of course. Regards Heino

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Heino would check it l8r in the day... Thanks

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi to all, I have been reading and testing this post for a week now. I think i have a ranging market solution its indicator caled TOR. You can get it here ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=33342 ) This indicator keept me from making trades in last two days of previous trading week. You should try it. Have a nice day all.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Thanks Heino.....will put it to test and let u know back

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hello, thank you people, now you give me some new stoff to learn, I hope I can undestand it well, I will look at the TOR indicator. Then I want to put two startegies in the EA for trend and ranging market and then we can look how the results are.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi Wahnone.....does your system work well on other time frames or just 15 min charts??/

--- 帖子 #635 ---
How does it indicate when the market is trending or ranging?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
I have added a picture of current market as you can se its ranging in most of the timeframes. This movement is calculated as ADX more about that you can read in link provided in my previous post. As i start trading in euro market ... today is ... well ranging market, unles you are a scalper we must wait for better chances.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Thanks for posting the pic and explaining it, Gold. I had this indicator but I had never used it much, but I see it could be valuable. I think I will use it more. PD

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thanks a lot for this contribution. Checking it out.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I think this helps a lot. Does it work on the principle that if the adx line is below 20, then it is a range? Or how exactly does it determine if it is trending or ranging? Just curious...

--- 帖子 #641 ---
It as been reported to work very well on 1hr charts. Other timeframes are still yet to be tested.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Heino, Thank you for your effort, I will test and post my findings.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Heino, I don't seem to understand some languages in that EA, I am sure its not english.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hello, yes it is write in german, I can explain some thinks that I think maybe some dont understand there are the options with the word "Abweichung" this means the distance from two line, example a cross is make then the distance from two lines you can set there. Then there are Tradingtime_Setting here is the option "Von" the Starttime and "Bis" the endtime for trading. Dont write "00:00" for "Bis" if you want to trade all day, write better "23:59". By Starttime is not problem you can write "00:00". That are the tradingstimes. There is a option "Sicherheitsstop" here you can set that for a open Order a Stoploss will be make after a distance in Pips when the orders is in profit, maybe the order ist 20 Pips in Profit than you can set "Sicherheitsstop=20" then for the Order a Stoploss will be change for 1 Pip profit. "BuyErlaubt" and "SellErlaubt" are for allow Buy and Sell Orders. And thats all I think the other settings just indicator settings, you can aktivate every indikator or just aktivate one. I hope we can find profitabel settings, like I have see here was one man hoe have make profitabel backtest but when I tried to use the EA I get much errores print and then have write self one. The most Loose are in range market one must do something then that we dont losse to much, I am not a good trader I but I have learn a bit good coding in the past.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I have testing the TOR Indikator which we want use for range tarding but I dont have find good result, The indikator tries to find range by adx indikator, in the EA from me I can also input the ADX, but I have trie it before to trade the envelopes range trading strategie when ADX is smaller than 30 by thinking there is know a range, but it was not good result. I have put the ADX Indikator know in the EA and you can aktivate him and set a level, the ADX must be then bigger as the level for trade allow. Then you can all trie it self.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Thanks; would test

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hello Heino, Here are my suggestions. I would not use the TOR indicator and Momentum indicators. I would use the Laguerre indicator. I have attached it to this post and It has the correct default settings already programmed in it. I use it manually with this system and it rocks. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=48926 Below is how the author of the thread uses the lag to enter the trade from the chart on post #1 on that thread. I use that as a basis for all my entries. Yes, entry has to be done based on it changing from top to bottom and vice versa , gives good I take the long entry once its crossed 0.15 going upwards and short entry once its crossed 0.85 going downwards. Now. I use this exit strategy as well and if you code this exit strategy this ea will make pips for everyone. The below exit info is from another website that shows this exit strategy is one of the best exit strategies anywhere. If you pm me I will message you the link for it. Forex Factory will not allow me to post the link here as it would be a forbidden link. FYI, I did send a private message to Wahnone indicating the link to this exit strategy as well. I did that a few days ago. In the article, it uses 1.5 ATRs or 4.0 ATRs based on the strength of the trend (if ADX &gt; 20, use 4.0, otherwise use 1.5 but i manually use 4.0 and 2.0 Regards, Jeff Note, if anyone wants more info on the Laguerre indicator you can goto to the first thread listed below which was created by the person who made this indicator and if you want the source code you can goto the 2nd link. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=53189 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=53189&amp;page=15

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Thanks Jeff, nice info.....so you say forget all the other indi's just use the Laguerre for entry &amp; exit as described for manual trading, &amp; if Heino can program this as well as the ATR'S 4.0 &amp; 1.5 in reference to the ADX'S, then we should have a good EA

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Here is a useful indicator I have been using to confirm entries and sometimes exits. It can give you more confidence in the trade once you get familiar with it. PD Trend Friend TF_1.01.mq4 Copyright 2008 Tom Balfe =========

I just started trading sss a week ago. Still learning from all of you. Thanks PistolDave for TF. I will give it a try I am also trying to use probability meter from FerruFx to act as a confirmation tool. Will report back later....

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Jeff, just manually traded with the suggested system at that first post you mentioned..... using just the Laguerre ACS1, MACD 12,20,9 &amp; the Stoch Histogram 14,3,3......and already traded &amp; closed a short for 60 pips on EU.....looks great mate thanks.....hopefully Heino can program an EA with all your post recommendations, including the exits using ATR'S.......thanks again

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I looked at FerruFx's website where he is selling it and it looks like a meter that combines the stochs and macds from two or three time frames in combination, right? How are you doing with that probability meter? If it works like he claims, it should help you get into a lot of good trades. PD

--- 帖子 #654 ---
I already tried it, but it was a bit too fast for my liking. Also, what happens whet the laguerre line doesn't get to the 0.85 and 0.15 level before changing over? I think it does work for some people, but I will want us all to give it a test.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Hello, That is not what I typed. I typed use the Lag indy instead of momentum or Tor indy's in conjunction with the other items for entry with this very nice system. Then, I suggest to use the exit strategy that I mentioned. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi Wahnone, thanks for sharing your SSSystem with us. Can you please tell me how you use the parabolic SAR and do you have a file for meto download into MT4? I have never used this indicator and don't know anything about it. Maybe a question was asked in later threads but I dont have the time to go looking! thanks! Sensei.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hello, I have trie to input the Laguerre indikator for entry strategie, hoe wants can test it, my laguerre indikator use global variables so the template must be used for that the indicator is on the chart. For the exit I dont have make something till now, but I can later, if we find some good entrys first. If someone find good settings we can work togehter a bit, contact me. I just seach a system that is not so bad, thats all.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hello, Very nice results. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Parabolic SAR is already included in MT4. u can find it under Indicator. Just drag it over the price chart

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Dear Wahnone, Thanks a lot for your sharing, I will appreciate it if describe your final system. Thanks

--- 帖子 #661 ---
The system remains the same. The only change is that dinapoli stoch is no more neccessary and so it as been removed. Still trying to fine tune the signals with laguerre and a couple other indicators though.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Wahnone, I like your system, thanks for sharing with us! Question, are you using a trend finder? For example a Sma 89 or Sma 50 or Sma 32? Not to trade against. I'am kinda confused about trend finders. I can't decide if we should use one or not? Do you recommend that we use a Sma as a trend finder or not use one? Thanks for all your help!!! Very nice system!!! snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #663 ---
It absolutely depends on you. The system on its default doesn't use any trend finders, but if you feel they are neccessary, then good luck with it, since all we want is a way to make more pips.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi Wahnone, nice Simple System Once you have settled on what indicators your going to use can you update the first post with your new final simple system? Thank you

--- 帖子 #665 ---
how have your results been using this system? thanks!

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Wahnone, Thanks for the nice system, have been playing with it for a week now What is your feeling about the laguerre? Mind sharing some insight on how to incorporate into the system? Houston

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Ya the laguerre is a good nice indicator. I don't use it because according to how it's used, you may not get into some proper setups, or get whipsawed cos its a bit too choppy for my liking. Thats my opinion though, it might work for you.

Hello guys. I came across this Synergy trading method by Dean Malone and that's why I have become a bit quiet on posting in this thread. I saw the traders dynamic index indicator (TDI), it is really a good and a all in one indicator that shows most market conditions. Description Green line must be above red line, yellow line, and 50 level for a buy. Vise versa for a sell. I want us to take a look and see which is better between this TDI and the mometum. I have attached a chart with the indicator at its default setting and the indicator itself. Let's check it out... Happy pippin' to us all.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
^^ it seems like you don't need the 50 line to get in. l quickly looked at some charts and you would have missed large pip movements. why not just trade when the green line is above the other two.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
The problem with taking this approach is getting stung badly when the market is stuck in a trading range. Yes, you miss the first pips of a move, but waiting for 50 to be crossed keeps you out of an awful lot of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
upon further analysis. isn't the green line is just the rsi. There have been so many strategies that call for a buy above 50 and a sell below. how do you avoid whipsaw? when the green crosses below the red you would get out to take profit? and re-enter if it crosses above the red again?

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I don't have the "TDI" indicator. However, I use the RSI set at 8 with 56 and 44 support levels. When the RSI is trading between the 56 and 44 levels the market is thrashing around and I don't trade. I trade the "e-mini dow", $5.00 per point using 15 period range charts. This system is timing the dow very closely. I'am a scalper and when the ema 5 crosses the ema 8 and the rsi goes above 56 or below 44 levels, I'll enter the market and watch it very closely. If it starts moving against me, 4 or 5 points, $20.00 or $25.00 dollars I'll liquidate. I'll keep the trade on entil it moves against me. I like the rsi 8 better than the momentum 10 indicator. I hope this helps someone... snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #677 ---
good info. i have to check it out. i keep reading about the 50 line to buy or sell. what does the 56 and 44 do about whipsaw?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
A lot of times the RSI will go above the 50% line then whip back down. It seems the RSI will bounce around the 50 line. A little above it and a little below it. In my opinion if your making your buys/sells at the 50% line, your going to get chopped-up. However, if you let "momentum" work in your favor. (A shot fired from a cannon seems to keep moving in that direction). So when the RSI moves through the 50% line and keeps going through the 56 line it will for the most part, keep moving in that direction. Or, through the 50% line and keeps going through the 44 line it will for the most part keep going. A lot of times the RSI will chop between the 44-50-56 levels. (chop zone or equal area) but once outside of these lines it will make a good move. But you still have to watch it and manage the position. snarlyjack

Hi. I have read this thread in the past three weeks and I also started to use the system last friday. It is working great on EUR/USD 15m chart. In 6 hours produced about 70 pips. I also tried the EA but I cannot make it to work. I read all the posts. I used all the indicators in the thread and I am still receiving cannot open QQEA.ex4 error. I use Metatrader 4 - Interbank FX Trader version 4.0 bulid 218 on Windows Vista. From all indicators posted here I managed to make work only QQE Allert V1 and QQE Allert _MTF_V2. I even tried to change the name on those two indicators but it did not help. More, it crashed the program so I deleted them and put them back on with their original names. The QQE Allert V3 does not work at all. I am attaching a picture of the desktop. The blue and pink dots are generated by the QQE Allert V1. The QQE indicator in the bar is the QQE Allert _MTF_V2. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I have tried the QQE with alert before and it doesn't work with this EA. Even if I changed the name to just QQE without the Alert it still doesn't work. I solved this problem by looking for the original QQE without Alert posted by Wahnone and then the EA works. I believed this EA was build basing on this particular QQE. Attached please find the QQE and a chart. PS: The picture was saved with the Expert Adviser in off mode and thats why you see a cross instead of a smiley.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
well, elliot osc will help you to see the market direction example: are you on a short position but the price is going up and you're thinking about close your position. if the elliot osc is going down it means that the market price will still go down,of course that it dont works 100% of the times,but helps a lot. another tip: only trade when stochastic is crossing/or about to cross http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/4738/stohb1.jpg i hope it helps ! regards

Thank you Harry. Apparently I got no error. I am still waiting the EA to create the first trade. Thank you again for your help. Update: it is working. Just generated the first trade! Thank you!

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Manuall trading is the best way to do this... as IngridK pointed out. You need to confirm trades with a higher timeframe, confirm the trend. What this EA need is a "trend confirmer", quadruple 5-8 to 20-32 for example, and only trade with the trend. Did I mention trend? Look at my chart: black arrows are 5-8, big arrows are 20-32 emulating H4 and the big green and red line (120-192) are emulating D1 ... which way and when would you trend? I mean trade?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi DramaKing, Thank you for your Info . I would be appriciated if you post me EA 'trend confirmer' quadruple Thank you pete

--- 帖子 #696 ---
There is no "Trend Confirmer", it was just a suggestion to add to the "Simple Studpid System" EA to help pick the right trades. I only use indicators and MA alarms

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Hi everyone . Does anyone have a pip count from a demo account to let others know how things are working out , and from what pairs they are using . I realize others are trying to mxamize this EA . but was just wondering , also what settings they are using .....??? thanks in advance ...

Wahnone, I've been watching this thread almost from the beginning, and now seems like a good time to comment. I'm not usually one that flits from 1 system to another, I have a scalping system on the 5/15's which involves the QQE, MA cross and CCI. Its something that works for me, and I'm happy. However, your system grabbed my attention because of the QQE. I do like it, I must admit. I've been testing it this week, taking what I think are sensible trades, i.e. nothing around the EMA200, and nothng heading in to an obvious S/R level. Using fixed SL &amp; TP of 25, I've had 12 winners and 2 losers. Only the latest one have I trailed the stop. EJ now short at 148.15, trailed to .90 which I think could blow. But I was dabbling .... Basically I hate losing money, absolutely hate it, which is why I try to mechanically scalp. 25 pip stop losses go against my personality - some will think this is stupid (like the system!), but thats just the way I am. So I need to thank you for changing my mindset, although to be honest, I had some of the instruments already. But your research and the comments of the other posters here have helped me greatly. Thanks, PQ.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
PQ, sounds like you are doing well. Good job. What time frames are you using and are you only trading the EJ?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
there..

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Bradev, all on 15M TF. Looking back at my log, EJ has been the dominant, although I've taken USD/CAD a few times. e.g. UCAD 21:15 GMT last night I thought it was a good signal seeing as it would test resitance 25 pips away - and it did. Just took cable short at 14:00 GMT, and unfortunately the SL just got nudged. Looking at it now, my SL needed to be 26 as the short is now falling bigtime. One thing of note - EUR's been heading south this week, so maybe taking shorts on a QQE cross has been a sure thing. 3 losers now out of 15 trades over 4 days is pretty good going - but will the system hold up long term in all market conditions? I don't know. I hope so. cheers, PQ

--- 帖子 #702 ---
I have had some success using this system on a 15 minute chart with the major pairs by using some other indicators mentioned here and possibly in other forums. These are the ToR 1.20, and Trend Friend. When the higher time frames agree, the trade is usually a good one. I have traded against them, and the trade is usally NOT good when I do. Also, the trading is usually bad after about 10:00 AM Pacific Standard Time, as was pointed out in the first post. The basic indicators Mom, CCI8 and 5,3,3 stoch along with the QQE with alert are great alerts, and with the addition to my chart of the above mentioned indicators for confirmation of trend, this is a very good, and still very simple system. No matter what, I always set a 30 PIP stop loss. I willonly set a 30 PIP take profit if I'm not here. When I'm able towatch the charts, I won't exit until the moving average crosses and/or the Mom goes above or below zero. This way, you get to ride some very good trends.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Paradoxical, I agree with what you're saying. My usual scalping techniques I referred to earlier on a 5M are with 15M confirmation and when combined with a QQE and CCI, I have good success. Switching to longer trades, and trailing stops is difficult for me. Nothing to do with this or any other system, just my mindset and my problem! As a scalper, if I'm 25 pips up, Im already too excited and looking to bank them, not move the SL to BE. With the EUR on a pretty even downtrend all week, taking shorts given the right signals has been a shoe-in IMO. Don't know how I'd cope under different market conditions - even the OP said he's getting 60%, and 60% success to me is touch and go given my personality. cheers, PQ

[quote=Wahnone;2203125]Hello guys. I came across this Synergy trading method by Dean Malone and that's why I have become a bit quiet on posting in this thread. I saw the traders dynamic index indicator (TDI), it is really a good and a all in one indicator that shows most market conditions. It's a real loser ! Way too many false breakout's of the channel. I forward tested it for almost three months with various pairs on different time frames because it looked so promising. This is Dean Malone's 'BASIC STRATEGY' To go to his advanced seminar and learn how to do it right will cost you $1000 if I remember correctly. The TDI is a 'fairly good' indicator, but it doesn't give you any more reliable information than the FX Sniper Ergodic Trigger. Just more unnessary lines which only follow price action. Plus somone 'discovered' the Synergy System a couple of months back and started posting it in the FF. The thread quickly died, and for good reason.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi Wahnone, Thanks for sharing your system. Would you please advice your latest setup for the system? Also how can you confirm your trades on multi time frame? (Do you really do it?) What currency pair normally you use? Thanks

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi, Would anybody (Specially Wahnone) advice how can I filter the specified false signal from the picture? Thanks

--- 帖子 #707 ---
As some people have mentioned earlier, you can confirm with a higher timeframe. If you look at my chart... you notice I don't have all your signals (for some reason), and you also notice the trend from a higher timeframe so you don't trade against the trend. But you can't predict everything, you will loose trades. There are these days with high volatility. Also.. there were a "Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes" in Australia the 19th that probably didn't help.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
I notice that you only have the Mom indicator. I use the CCI 8 and Stoch 5,3,3. I also have added two other indicators called Tor 1.20 and Trend friend 1.01. Attached is a screen shot. If the 15 minute signal agrees with the one hour and four hour, it is usually a good trade. These two indicators help keep you out of those ranging markets, too, because the ToR 1.20 also shows either "ranging" or "weaker". I don't make a trade when it says that. You will get fewer trades, and probably get in a little later, but most trades will be better ones using these indicators in addition to the others, and I think this still keeps the system "simple" even though there's more indicators. Last week I made something like 400 pips on my live account. They won't all be like that, but my trading has improved 100% using this system along with the added indicators.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
can you advice more about your indicators?

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Here is the ToR 1.20. You'll need to watch it awhile to get a feel for it. The time frames are from 1 minute to 4 hours, and, depending on the strength of the pair in those time frames, you'll get a reading of weaker, ranging or stronger with arrows pointing up, down, or at a 45 degree angle. I use the 15 minute charts. If the other indicators line up, I look at Tor 1.20 to see what it says about the strength of the pair. Unless it has at least strong readings for the hour time frame, I will not take a position. I definitely won't take it if it says "ranging". This has saved me getting into a lot of trades that go the other way within 10-30 minutes after I enter. If you get strong readings on the 4 hour also, it's usually a good trade, as it means that pair has been going that way for awhile. will post the Trend Friend in next post.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Kevian, Here's the Trend Friend. Not much to explain. Generally, I don't take a trade unless at least the one hour reading agrees with the 15 minute.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
hi paradoxical, Could you please explain more about trend friend because there are macd,ema set1 &amp; ema set2. from 1min to 4hrs TF. you mean all of macd,ema 1 &amp; ema 2 in 15 mins reading agree with 1 hr. what's about 30mins &amp; 4 hrs? I saw yellow line in your chart. What's it? Oh one more question which pairs are you trading?. I'm trying to stick to one pair as some people said. Just like today E/U is ranging so no trade for me.What is your opinion I like your strategy it's simple and I beleive it's effective. Hope to hear from soon Thank you Paradoxical Pete.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Hi! I am following this topic since july. I was inspired to open a demo account and to see if I can trade Forex. Apparently I can. Using this system I have got very good results on demo accounts. Today I entered live. The first trade made on the system: EUR/USD 63pips. Thank you Wahnone! I had no courage to let the EA since I could see a tendency to enter a bit late in the trade. So I have the signal but trade manually. I still have a question. My chart does not show any signal on the Elliott wave oscilator though I downloaded the indicators posted by affandiz in post 701. Is it normal? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hello majorusa U can try both of this indicator. Cheers ~Profi~

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Thanks profi. The second one give signals.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
They are various moving averages. Forget the yellow line. Doesn't mean anything. If you see a pair ranging in more than a few time frames, I would pass on it. I use this in a 15 minute time frame, and I like to see the hour and 4 hour time frames all green if I'm going long, or allred, if I'm going short. Those won't light up unless the pair has been trending in that direction for at least that period of time. That means the pair is trending in that direction. As far as the 5 minute and one minute time frames, that just means the pair has been moving that way for one minute or 5 minutes. That's why those will change more rapidly because it's a quicker time frame.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Thanks Paradoxical Pete

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hi Majorusa, Congratulation I'm still doing on demo. I hope I can trade live soon Pete

--- 帖子 #719 ---
You should demo this until you are CONSISTENTLY profitable. That may take some time. You should play with stop losses and take profits. It's nice to have those big runs, but those don't happen all the time, EVEN when everything reads GO when you enter. If indicators were a sure thing, it's a sure thing they wouldn't work anymore, because the brokers wouldn't stand for losing. They are a guide only. A compass. A guage. Some people say indicators are worth NOTHING! I'm not in that camp. But, just pointing out that there are some that make very reasoned arguments that indicators are worthless. You need to see for yourself. Do tests. SSee what happens when you do X, and when you do Y. Then, see if it's consistent. If it works, then try it live with small money. But, keep in mind, in forex, things change. What works this month or year, may not work in the future.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I totally agree. And the market can humble you in a split second. It happened to me. After that 63 pips, three wrong enters and result is a net -78 pips. Then I took a break. I still have a position open on the usd/jpy with the trend against me but on the longer times charts the trend is right. Will see... And another thing. I trade with money that I can afford to lose. I do not want to lose them but I can afford it. DO NOT TRADE ON CREDIT!

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hello, can you please tell your settings for the EA if you have time someday.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Sorry but it took me some time to find my settings. I am using the standard settings with two twists: the SL is at 30 and the smooth factor of QQE is at 5. I am not using the EA to trade. I did and the results were negative. I trade manualy. I also have the Bollinger bands on the chart. In addition I am using chartist to identify the formations in which the trend is moving. I can post here the yesterday results on demo. I stoped for the time being live untill I tweak some more the system. I also did another mistake on live. Did not apply money management correctly. Now I tweaked one money management system and the result is below. I traded in lots of 0.1 of the mini lots. Here are the results:

--- 帖子 #723 ---
[quote=majorusa;2231668]In addition I am using chartist to identify the formations in which the trend is moving. Hi majjorusa can you post here your indicator Chartist thanks ashi

--- 帖子 #724 ---
It is not an indicator. It is a software to identify the trend formations simultaneously on a lot of pairs. You have here a screen capture. Want to know more: www.autochartist.com . My broker provides this tool for free.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Wahnone develloped a good system. But, as I was testing, does not work by itself. I am posting you the results from this morning. The two negative trades were a mistake. I entered without watching the 1 min chart and without respecting the signal. The 13 USD trade was opened automatically by the EA. I forgot to close it. And it was a 1 lot. The rest were o.1 of mini lot. The rest are textbook. So, it is working but not on automatic pilot. Money management is essential too. I also put the chart showing the trend breakout. These were the last two trades. Enjoy. Update: i took another two trades, both succesfull but closed by the trailing stop at 4 and 5 pips. Total result for the day 107 pips. 11 trades, 9 won, 2 loss.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
thanks majorusa

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I've been trading very successfully and think this is one of the better systems around. I use it mosly on 30 minute charts. I trade manually and keep my stops at 20 and shoot for anything from 10 to 20 for profit. Please keep up the good work and I will let you know how I do on my Demo. cwave

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I restarted to trade on live with mixed results: 7 wins, 5 loses, 59% success ratio for a net of 24 pips. I am using micro lots with strong money management. I also increased the SL to 100 pips since I discovered that S/L of 30 pips does not do any good on the 15 minutes chart. last night by example a sharp decline in price trigerred the S/L, dropped below the line 3 pips then reboundedin a +10-15 pips above the buy price. So I missed the whole move.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Majorusa, Try the 30 minute chart. All I do is wait for my arrow and alert and I open a trade immediately. I set my profit at 10 pips. Almost everytime I hit my 10 pips. Sometimes sooner and sometimes it takes hours. But it's very accurate. Always stay away when the news hits. cwave

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Cwave, I'm still following this and think it's one of the best manual systems around. I have been successful in trading it (when time permits). Are you using the QQE and trading in that direction once you get a MA cross? Your strategy of using M30 may suit me better too, as the crosses are less frequent and less whipsaw I think. Please keep us posted as to your results. Thanks, ^ Optimist ^

--- 帖子 #731 ---
For people interested live results from this week. All are traded manually on the Wahnone system on the 15 min chart with confirmation on the 1 min, 5 min and 1H charts. The amounts are in USD. P.S. Where is Wahnone?

--- 帖子 #732 ---
I am around sometimes on the forum but I am currently working on my 4hr system and that is why I have not had time for this thread. I will soon cobtinue to post my trades daily again. For now, i am still perfecting my 4hr system as I find the 4hr less stressfull, while you can also make what you make on lower timeframes on it(4hr) by trading multiple pairs. See you then.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
You guys still using the Rules on post #1?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
I stumble upon your thread today, I have set up the template charts etc. I have been trading forex for awhile now. Your system ROCKS Simple and effective. Thank you for sharing and helping other traders.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Understand this was done with a demo and these are results for the past two days. This may sound weird but the last EUR/GBP trade lost for about 200.00 but I wanted to hit sleep and got out for a loss. It should count as a win because it proceeded to my TP. I just wait for that 30 minute alert and check to make sure my indicators lined up. I shoot for 10 pips and get out or sometimes look for my support or resistance areas to ride them for more profit. I'm still practicing and I never set a stop loss because I watch the trade through. If I have to step away for extened periods I will set a stop loss. I find the QQE to be one of the better indicators around. I stay away whenever the news breaks. Look at your thirty minute charts and you'll see the arrows from the alerts and it almost always hits the 10 pip mark. I DO NOT display good money management with the account as you can see. But my idea is to test. I think there are people with better skills who could really do a lot better and would love other people to run this test along with me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi! Can you post what indicators are you using on the EURUSD chart? Tks.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
What started out as a nice system/strategy with 2 MA's, 2 indicators and an alert has now grown to almost triple that amount. Newbees never seem to learn that cluttering up the charts and making it look like a plate of speghetti with multiple indicators (all of which tells you the same thing) will never predict what the price action is going to do next. Oh well - I'm outta here with a sad heart. Another good thread ruined.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Well, things evolve sometimes. What Wahnone started is a great system. Though, it fails to function from time to time. Therefore, used by itself can bring your account in the ground. That is why some of us felt the need to add some more ellements. If you are looking at my charts you will see bollinger bands, fractals and trendfinder. These are not complicating the system but give you a better chance to win. To prove my point please see the statements below. It is from live account not demo. The first trades until 18.09.2008 were made exclusivelly on the system. Dire results. Then I added the othe things. The net result after this change was a plus of 77.80 USD. Sometimes newbies think that a good and simple system is enough to make a ton of money. And I did not tell you yet about money management...

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Wahnone, where are you? How can we find out about your 4H system? This one is far from stupid. I've tried and tested a lot of systems on this site and this one works so well. Please let us know how to find out about your new 4H system... Thanks Erbguy

--- 帖子 #747 ---
thanks cwave for the blog from ALG, very interesting Ashi

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Could some kind soul post all the latest templates &amp; indicators for this system in one place, so we don't have to go find odd bits and bobs then find out they have been revised. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I understand your concern, but I feel there is nothing wrong in improving a system so that it can improve your results. Since we all want to maximize our profits, then optimizing our strategy to make better signals is not bad at all.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
The templates and indicators remain the same and the rest depends on your preference i.e timeframe to trade, exit strategy e.t.c. This system on its self is profitable.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Thanks for replying so soon. Just downloaded and implemented them, will give it some attention. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
The system kept me out of a couple of bad trades where I would normally have made an entry to scam, at lunch time JP time. Very pleased with the manner in which it does not get suckered into an entry and this probably saved me from losing the $800 I pulled out of the market early this morning. Bravo More testing to do here.

I think that has done the trick. Greatly appreciated and many thanks to all. Now, I just have to learn to use it wisely. I have just noticed that theEA is actual trying to trade on this demo I am using. Will this program actually trade automatically if setup correctly? I noticed that it is telling that there is not enough money in the demo acout to open an order even though there is around $2,000 in it. Do I need to set up the EA with smaller amounts or something? Sorry for more questions. http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/2366/donewf3.jpg

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I think I have got the EA working in auto trading mode. Had to edit the EA to reduce the size of the lots it was trying to buy because of the margin in the account. Just taking it for a spin in this demo. Once again, I can not thank everyone enough for extending their kind assistance to a newbie who is still bewildered by MT4 and indeed trading itself. Steve

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Youre welcome. But I would reccommend to read some of the posts here. The EA can trade by itself but I found that the results are less good than trading the system manually. Wahnone created a very good system but in my opinion does not work by itself. So education is the key. Use the system with suport and ressistance lines and determine patterns like triangle, wdge, channel, etc to se that you are trading in the trend and not against. Even so the market can trade against you. To give you an example, today a 60 pips spike triggered my stop loss though I was trading in the trend. See picture. So trade wisely, with money management! Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Thanks for the info. I am just testing out the Autotrade function in MT4 as I am very new to this platform. I intend to trade manually, perhaps based loosely on an EA but mainly with fibs and my feet in a bucket of iced water.

EA open hour setting? Does anyone know if this setting is country specific? I mean, I am here in Japan with a large time difference to most countries. Some of the Open hour settings in the EA were set to 7 and some to 0, so I am a little uncertain as to how to set these up.

These are referring to the Metatrader hours. Look at the bar in the left side - Market watch. That is the hour the EA will take. Determine your best hours.

Hmm, after careful deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that I can not make head nor tail of the meaning of the "Open Hour" even after examining the market watch chart. Actually, I am more confused as my market watch time says 08:33 when actually here in Japan it is 17:33. I am trading USD/JPY GBP/JPY &amp; EUR/JPY so do I have to set a different "Open Hour" for each, or just the time of day I want MT4 to start trading from? I have it set to trade 24 hours so perhaps this is why I can not get a handle on the meaning of it. http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/7...enhoursse8.jpg

Do you mean the pop up prices as in the screen shot above? The quick way to pop it up is the F10 KEY! Or,go FILE-VIEW-MARKET WATCH. Then, Right click anywhere on market watch and choose POP UP PRICES. This thread has good info on MT4 shortcuts. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=2245371

Rastaman "I am more confused as my market watch time says 08:33 when actually here in Japan it is 17:33." For the EA the clock that matters is the market watch. 8.33 is GMT. Therefore if you want to trade only on Japan input the market watch for Japan. Hope that it helps.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Thanks again for your help.. I don't mind when it trades and would prefer it traded at all times so I can test it out properly. So, can I leave the Open hour at ZERO and just set hours to trade at 24? I am just concerned that it doesn't stop trading.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Rastaman, where can I get these dots on your charts? Ashi

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Download and drop all these files in your Mt4 folders, run MT4 and open a chart then load the sss.template.new. Majorusa kindly posted them on P52 of this thread. I presume that unlike me, you are not new to MT4 and know how to setup an Expert Adviser. Hope this helps I have tested this for a few days with my VERY limited knowledge and notice that it is very good for showing me a possibly entry but it seems to get into a dodgy trade quite a lot yet at the same time, seems to miss a long trend. My stop was getting hit quite a lot at 20 pips so I will try to adjust the SL and see how it does. Just wondering if anyone had adjusted the indicators successfully to make it more reliable. There again it could just the market which appears to have become so erratic recently.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
hai all.. im testing SS Beta Ver 2. so i have a question. what hot setting for all buffer..? i mean, QQE Entry buffer, QQE Exit, EMA Entry and EMA Exit buffer..? and i used pair GU at TF 30M, coz at TF15 that have a lot of false signal.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
hai everybody, anybody try Taravolta EA's?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi all, i came across this thread and quickly installed MT4 (I have never used MT befor) to test out this system. And it seems to work very well! I am using the first versione from the first page in this thread posted from "Wahnone". So i am using it on GBP/USD using indicators and template. I like to use it also on other currencies. Can please tell me anyone how to use this indicators/template on other currencies? As i say i am very new on meta trader. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #789 ---
ok i just found how to load the template also with other currencies...

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Is anyone else experiencing this EA missing juicy trades like this or is it just me? Seems to take chance trades and miss good ones for some strange reason. All the signals seem aligned for it to make a decision to take this trade, yet it doesn't. http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/6...tradingro6.jpg Here is another example of not taking a good trade on CHF/JPY even though the green BUY LONG signal is certainly there on the chart. AM just wondering if this is due to the EA OPEN HOUR being set at 0. Haven't a clue what to set this to as MT4 market watch time is not adjustable to JP time. http://img391.imageshack.us/img391/4527/chfjpykt7.jpg

I've been working on this system I have been doing well. I would love to share and get some opinions. It runs on two ADX indicators and I like the 1 Hour but can go on 30 minutes and maybe even other charts. The concept is when the two solid colored arrows in red and white pop up on the candlestick you should open a trade immediately on the next candlestick. It usually hits 20 pips off almost every time. If someone could create an EA Advisor based on this concept I think it could work. The EA could open the trade sooner than a manual trade and could make for more pips each trade. Please look and let me know what you think. Happy trading, cwave

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Wahnone check your pm

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hi, you could open a new thread for your system ... even if it's to be short lived Anyways you do realize that your adx cross indicators draw the arrow two candles too late ? In other words you enter 2 candles from when they both show. It's easy to see if you attach the standard ADX indicator with 14 and 21 periods. Still there's some moves this setups detects m78

--- 帖子 #794 ---
hi, i am using the "default" settings (with indicators on the first thread) The last few days the system wasnt good and gives entry signals (popup) a bit too late for a good entry that brings some loosing trades. and alerts is coming for indicator "QQE Alert v3" only: ------------------------------------ 10:23:25 QQE Alert v3 USDCHF,M15: Alert: QQE Cross Trend going UP on USDCHF M15 ------------------------------------ So no moving average alerts (they seems better as entry point.) Do i miss something or perhaps i have no the latest indiators? Also i have some different QQE indicators, not sure wich on is correct... I have attached a screen of a chart. PS: There is additionally stocastic indicator i put in but nothing else. Thanks a lot for any help!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
The EA is not working, can you give more input. when I place both ADXcrosses.ex in the chart nothing happen... the expert Advisor is green ashi

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Where is EA Ashi ? I have it working manually &amp; it's looking good on 30min bars

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I am trading the SSS &amp; that also is looking v good

--- 帖子 #798 ---
glowarm which SSS do you use? There are a lot of modified SSS in this Thread, I'm a little bit confused. I tried the last one, modified by cwave, but the Expert Advisor from cwave is not working automatically, only manual with fast signal. Ashi

--- 帖子 #799 ---
me to.. there are many attached and modified indicators and i am not up to date with them. I made some demo trades yesterday and ALL where loosing trades. Can please somone attache here the latest version with all indicators for this system? Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #800 ---
I'm using the template &amp; indicators posted by Rastaman a few posts ago

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I am not using the EA, just trading manually

--- 帖子 #802 ---
I dropped this system as it was giving me too many false signals or I was not reading it correctly on GBP/JPY and other JPY currency. I am using this manual system which seems spot on for the last 10 days or so. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=40325

--- 帖子 #803 ---
You will discover eventually that whenever an EA is introduced into the strategy/system it does nothing more than screw up the whole thing. Trading the forex is a business, treat it like a business. And you're the CEO of this business. It's up to you to make the decisions about every trade. You going to relegate that responsibility to someone else? It will never become successful by expecting it become 'automatic' without putting your attention to it. There IS NO OTHER WAY IMO but to trade manually! Of course I'm going to get slammed for posting this observation (which is a fact and not an opinion) by traders who believe or program EA's. But let's see who is still around this time next year trading with a real account and not just another demo account. I've been at this game a long time and I'll be at it way in the future. And I have absolutely no intention nor any desire to defend this statement further whatsoever!

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Fully agree, I've no time for EA's

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Totally agree. And to show the evidence that the system works very well on manual, look at the results on my live account. The first picture is EA trading. The second picture is manual trading. Can you spot the difference?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
You graphically illustrated my point perfectly! A picture is worth a thousand words!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Finally, a perfect day! I trade mini lots on the 1 min chart and I take profit at arround 15 pips. Today was less. The system worked very well but needs you there in front of the chart. This are today's results for arround 4 hours of trading. Live account, of course. This will be my last post on this thread unless Wahnone will release a new version. In my view, all that was to be said about this system - as it is - was said. Read and adapt it to your liking. Do not forget to use money management. Good luck and many happy pips.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
someone wanted this indicator so here it is.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
i agree with you. I stopped using this a long time ago. There is too much whipsaw. you may gain in one trade, but then get your profits taken away by false trades

--- 帖子 #810 ---
You SOUND sweet as your GUITAR,iam sure. This is a serious BUISNESS,with knives everywhere. baz

--- 帖子 #811 ---
I have a question why use so many Oscillators on the chart? The SSS was very simple before and now you have additional indicators and they are all telling you the same thing. Cramping up the chart with so many indicators does not guarantee success.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Inspired by SSS I call it KI$$

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Hello, I want to say I like your picture with the indicators and would like to speak with you about how you use the indicators for signal.

the strategy is good, the first time i use it on gu gave me 34pips at 11am GMT Thank u

What do you like to know?

I want to ask you if you have entry ruels from your indicators in the picture?

5-8openEMA_Cross_Arrow_with_Alerts ,.. is better than QQE ..but ..in flat days .. these wrong alerts gonna challenge your experience heheh...sss is a money maker... i like it

--- 帖子 #818 ---
HI about the trigger ...QQE and the 5-8openEMA_Cross_Arrow_with_Alerts ...which one is better ??

--- 帖子 #819 ---
it is an good system. I have improved it a little bit. So, first of all i also take a look for bigger trend on 4h chart. And i take a position on small charts only to way of main trend. This system is giving me 50-70 point s per day. Tanks a lot for sharing.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
QQE alert or...the 5-8openEMA_Cross_Arrow_with_Alerts which one??

--- 帖子 #821 ---
5-8 EMA

thank u

Can someone explain to me why is there no qqe down signal,coz on my opinion there should be one or am i mistaken

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hi guys,one question regarding ea...can i use it simultaneously on more than one pair and does anyone know the best settings for this ea

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Best settings for this EA is : right mouse click on the EA and then DELETE. Best settings for this %§$§&amp;)(/=?

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Just my opinion, but I think you would do better just trading this system manually if you have the time to monitor it. I have done well with it at times, and I still use it often. It seems to work best, like lots of other systems, when the market is trending and not too choppy. You have to learn when to use it by experience. I don't know, but would guess that an ea would not be profitable unless you used some discretion as to when to turn it on and off. What kind of results has anyone had so far with the ea, and manual trading? Thanks, PD

--- 帖子 #833 ---
I'm going to give this a go for a while-think it's important to tradefrom 6.30am to 10.30am, then 1pm-4pm (all UK times) as these are the times with most liquidity so market is more likely to trend

--- 帖子 #834 ---
is this method any good

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Thanks for sharing. Are you trading this system live? I will read the thread and try it on a demo

--- 帖子 #836 ---
I just found this system, looks promising, is there anyone still using this system, I will use this system starting 2010, best luck to us all

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Any one using this system? TF

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi, I'm interested in this system. It seems to me nice and profitable. Anyone still here?

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I blew my 2nd account using this strategy. It was a big one too. Probably my fault though ..... After some early wins, the OP abandoned it.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
The op didn't abandon it? Why don't you get your facts straight before you go posting around

audjpy +25 pips nzdjpy +7 pips eurjpy -13 pips (overstayed my welcome) usdjpy 0 pips (reversed quick, signals changed to upside) I just put this system on some charts today today to try it out, don't usually trade the M15 TF, tomorrow I'll take a run on the H1 charts. I'm GMT+9 and it's a little after 3 a.m. Missed the London session because of work. Tomorrow I'll have more time. Looks interesting.

Hey Rastaman, where are you living? I'm in Funabashi City in Chiba Prefecture.

....I'm Mr. Lonely. Who sang that song?This thread is like a ghost town. This morning, from about 10 a.m. till a little after noon Japan time (GMT + 9) the Asian session was pretty lively for a change. I picked up 60 pips using the SSS charts on the M15 TF, so it can be done. EURUSD for 40 pips. (TP hit for 20 pips and re-entered, TP hit again for 20), and NZDUSD hit my TP for 20 pips. My S/L's were also 20 pips. Why 20? Lately I've been very guilty of staying in trades too long. I've also been getting burned big-time lately using larger S/L's on the higher TF's. So I told myself to scale down and be happy with several smaller profits rather than go broke looking for the grand slam. I'm a thrill-seeker who likes to push the envelope. I know that's not a good character trait for a trader, and I'm really trying to correct it. But I also usually know when enough is enough and to stop screwing around. Also, the Asian session isn't exactly famous for huge rallies. I am thinking of tinkering with Wahnone's exit rules. The exit rule is to wait until the EMA and the QQE have both crossed in the opposite direction. I'm thinking a more profitable exit might be when the Momentum line goes flat or changes its up or down direction. I'll take a closer look during my trading to see if that's the case. I seem to remember Wahnone mentioning something to that effect earlier in the thread. Anyways, If anybody is still using the SSS method or even just lurking around, stop in and say howdy. It's awful quiet around here.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
thanks to ever made the QQE v5 indi... I notice there is a HUGE trading flaw with it. if you really want this to work extremely well with it, and hit the trades BEFORE the momentum builds with it, use the Ichimoku indicator, when the price action lines up with the previous equilibrium lines generated either off the Kumo cloud or Kijun Sen and the blue line crosses the yellow, HIT IT HARD! this method made me over 2600 pips in 36 hours

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Do you mean like in the attached pic? Do you use default Ichimoku settings, and what TF did you use to gain those pips? Thanks

--- 帖子 #682 ---
nope.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Right - thanks for the helpful pointer. Any other info you could give?

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Thanks for trying.....

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks Wahnone for sharing your idea. I've revised the plan for my trading. It's still a 5-8 EMA crossover. But no QQE. And I changed from the Dinapoli Stoch to the Stochastic Color v1.02 ClassicC. Basicly it's the same as the original.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
i just did... dont any of you read the posts? go back to my post and you will see the answers.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Is someone still trading this simple system? Just came across and intalled it. Now Iam trading it on the daily tf with quiet good results...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
HI，GUY，I am testing this trade system and try to use a EA method to trade.
