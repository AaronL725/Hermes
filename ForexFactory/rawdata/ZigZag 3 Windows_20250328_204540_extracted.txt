Is it trial version. if possible could you please share mq file as well.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi thanks you very much for this indicator in two days i made 71% with drawdown 23.94% thanks!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Well done on posting a chart costarica21.....I see it has been downloaded 107 times but no comments......I will test further next week and report. have a good weekend R

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Interesting, is this what you are using for the Bull Bear Trade Explorer? Time to go live with those results. How many pairs do you monitor and trade? Thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Impressive results! Which TF are using, is it the M1, 5, 15, or higher time frame!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This indicator needs a dashboard to monitor all the pairs Too hard to watch 3 charts of many pairs If there is, please share the method Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes a dashboard would be perfect plus you could use a Auto Trendline indicator also . How the zigzag swing is confirmed with that indicator?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Can u share the source code?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Depend of U strategy... I'm trade only GBPUSD pair. This indi good for scalping for GBPUSD. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Here it is in action, I guess, if the down trend continues, the 1 Minutes give signals, enter right away? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
thank you for this amazing indicator, it's showing great results here, after so many backtests it appeared that the price level repaints 10% of the times, can you suggest how we avoid this,

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Use Oscillator Filters

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Can you or anyone explain more on how to use this indicator? I have spent more than 30 minutes to try to understand it but still cannot.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I think you would need to spend some time watching the 3 GBPUSD charts while the market is open

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Good to see this thread with some action.....I have no desire to re-invent the wheel but there are usually more than one way to skin a cat. If one tests you will find an option which may suit you re this interesting indicator provided by crow...Thanks to crow for posting this indicator....Just my humble thoughts. R

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Ok. The ETHUSD market is open now. So how do I make of these 3 charts.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
According to the instruction, that's an uptrend, wait till 1 min TF gives buy signal and join.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Much simpler and more accurate way to get an entry. Not going to splash it here, would like something in return to be honest. Took me 10+ years to find a system where you can make money each and every day.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
@Bakker have you not gained any thing here for free?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thought in the 1 min chart, there is already an up arrow?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Yes! But wait for another up arrow in 1m while the 5/15 min are still buying

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Oh, if like what you said, then I understand.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Actually correction to my above post. Since this is a zig zag indicator, don't think there will be another buy arrow after buy arrow. Should be a sell arrow next. So like post #4 comment, the author post too little info and so people like me, don't understand and thus cannot comment more.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
No, I didn't, I just have a quick look at it and saw it's broadly in line with what I do. This system will require huge stop losses if you want to trade the longer time frames.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I think we need to wait for a buy opportunity in M1 while M5 and M15 are already in Buy mode and viceversa. So, There will be buy and sell signals in M1 alternately and enter with your own risk(SL) when we get a buy signal.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
So to put it simple, is it like this-&gt;? M15 in buy mode M5 in buy mode M1 in sell mode. Wait for it to turn to buy mode and place a trade?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Something like this? Once M1 got a buy signal, place a buy trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Yes. As per my understanding. Let Crow also confirm. Meanwhile, I will try in demo with SL in place..

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Boss, why not give us a clue since this strategy is in line with your strategy. Especially on risk rewards

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I liked. Subscribed. I hope this thread will go on. Is there not the possibility to add an alarm when the arrows appears?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I have been using zigzag for quite a while. Thank you for sharing this very nice indie! Is there an expiration date?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
It seems without expiration Only a donation.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi if you could add an option for an alert on a new arrow signal that would be great.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks for this indicator. It has been helpful so far. Do you have the same indi for MT5? Appreciate.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Stupid repaint indicator. Toss it out of the window.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) No, it's not! I like it, but I have to watch! Yes, it would be good to add an alarm.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
It repaints !

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Yes, you are correct, we like to think of it as updating when new information comes in. No one is making you use it, we got your point, thanks for the warning

Very good chart setup, thanks for sharing, I don't know what happened to CROW today? Still holding GPUSD longs, needs a huge bounce in US session

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thank you! Just wanted to show that the system is working! CROW well done!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Based on this system Today's profit is $93.69 or +5.30%

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Cool! Please which time frame are you using?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) M15 is sell M5 is buy M1 is buy So to use this indicator, must follow these steps? 1. Wait for M5 to become sell 2. Once M1 become sell, immediately place a sell trade

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Support this!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
2nd this!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Third!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) But instead of M5 become sell, M1 become sell. So should we open sell based on: M15 - sell M5 - buy M1 - sell

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now M5 become sell All 3 now sell M15 sell M5 sell M1 sell Open sell. Actually the description from the author is very poor, so no one can really know what is the "intended" way to trade using his indicator. So I find it is funny when users post profit praising this indicator when the instructions to use this is inadequate.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Appreciate your effort!!! Very well explained.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Until we will don't have an alarm, I guess that the best way to use this indicator is to apply only with one pair or index in open sessions market. Start with H1 and switch to the minor TF.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Wow, that's pretty good! Do you use it the same way as suggested by @crow ? Look at the 15m and then look at 5m if both are in the same direction then look at 1m and get the entry point there? Any other tip?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi only H1 and all pairs is traded

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hello, I just started using this system and have a very small question, how you guys are placing SL and TP using this system thank you.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Okay! Thank you

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Good question. I imagine that we will have to try options. It could be the SL in swing before the entry, change in the color of the line (or in the line of the upper TF, which would allow some reentry). Any suggestion?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
It is a very personal answer: don't worry too much about the SL. Take care about the right entry. Look at a profit and set a SL:TP 1:1 , 1:2 , 1:3. Use large Trailing Stop.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
AN AMAZING STRATEGY!!! Full credit to the creator - CROW. Here's what works for me - very effectively! ENTRY POINTS First , M15 arrow appears. Second , M5 arrow appears in same direction as M15. Third , M1 arrow appears in same direction as M5 - now enter trade in direction of M5 and M15. STOP LOSS BUY - Stop loss below the low of the M1 candle where the buy arrow appears. SELL - Stop loss above the high of the M1 candle where the sell arrow appears. TAKE PROFIT BUY - When M15 sell arrow appears. SELL - When M15 buy arrow appears.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi, And when indy is repainting, what do you do? Health jf

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Once all 3 time frames are in the same direction... if repainting happens, you atleast have confirmation that you have chosen the right direction. To each their own... works for me .

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Open question to anyone( not just programmer): Possible to program the above? Or only can manual trade?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Anyone know what the STAR symbol means?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Except that in real life it is on the shortest unit that the change of direction takes place first... In this specific case, it is 1 =&gt; change color and direction of the arrow on M1, then 2 =&gt; change color and direction of the arrow on M5, then 3 =&gt; change of color and direction of the arrow on M15 if the movement in M1 continues, but there, prices have already shifted a lot... We will therefore have to wait for a pull back

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Okay I understand. By the correct entry he means the entry into the small TF once it switches in favor with the higher TFs, as described in the beginning of the thread. Thanks for the reply.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Can you set an alarm for when the signal is output?

Could you make it that the Signal on TF1 be accounted only AFTER the first retracement, and if the other high tf be still on trend direction? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I tried your 2 files and seems that the alert will immediately appears only on M1 chart after selected the template. Do we need to open all 3 charts(M1, M5 and M15) or just M1 is enough? Also do we need to attach the zig zag indicator on any of the charts?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
You only need an M1 chart. Drop the MultiZigZag indicator on it. You will immediately get alerts on initial load for all previous signals. That's it! Make sure both indicators are in your MT4 indicators folder.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
The poster of this supposed edge also had an explorer running y/day long term which was in deep shit re drawdown and that has disappeared from his profile today lol! Just be careful - there is no verifiable recorded/documented empirical long-term evidence offered by the poster Crow to say this represents an edge or not. One day's results counts for nothing.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I tested your indicator. Seems like need to have 3 timeframes charts opened or else no alert message.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I get the first sound alert but no green or red dot, not at the same time. So how to do it?

Made a minor update... see if that's better. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13981425

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Does it recalculate to the lowers/highest swings?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
At this stage, let's keep it simple. Let's see if there's substance to the original system.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I assure you, that you don't need all 3 charts open. Made a minor update: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13981425

The original indicator does repaint - not much. This one consolidates the original idea into one indicator, so it will suffer from the same weaknesses of the original indicator.

Nice one thx for sharing Can you make expert that be nice

i work now to this dash mtf with arrow and price and i will posted soon .. thnx

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thanks Samsha786 for the indicator. Putting it on a chart freezes mt4, so I can't use it.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I want to check when the symbol appears, because seems alarms pop up after some time is passed, but not the symbol, anyway not freezing with 18 open charts

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I try useing this,does not crash. But alarm pops up later. for example realy time , EURAUDpops up alert 12;05,but this was 40min ago installed indicators multizizag and zig zag startlevel, next i switch on template. this is correct initiation? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yeh, the alarm and dialogue box pops up some time above or below where the green 1 or red 2 is, respectively. This London morning re Gbpusd as an example, the alarm went @ 1221pm broker time (red arrow on chart below) saying buy at the 1156am price which by now at 1221pm was actually 2572 ask, and the green 1 arrow was printed above the 11:56am candle broker time. I'm guessing the green 1 or red 2 actually prints at the same time as the alarm/dialogue box appears because this is when in reality (using a 1min chart) the 1min then 5min then 15min zigzags will have adjusted. As someone said in a post above, this is what actually happens, ie the smaller t/f zigzag adjusts first, so 1min then 5min, then 15min. The only time that the other two (ie 5min and 15min) don't adjust is when there is a strong trend, let's say like yesterday on gbpusd - a downtrend for eg and say 5 and 15min have already printed a red 2 and then price pulls back to the upside causing the 1min zigzag to adjust to a swing lo, and then price starts selling again and then the red 1 might appear again on 1min sometime after when the 1min zigzag adjusts again to that pullback hi. Hope everyone follows this as it is not as the original poster described it. It will be interesting for someone to post some results across multiple pairings/instruments. Gbpusd 1min below EDIT : Just as I was typing this another dialogue box popped up at 1402pm broker time and the red 2 was printed at same time ...so red 2 printed at the swing hi of 2602 above the 1239pm broker time 1min candle, and the alarm/dialogue box popped up saying sell @ 2602 but actually the price by then was 2582 bid, and was on that 1402pm broker time 1min candle close. Furthermore using the rules laid down by Samsha786 in post #59 of this thread....if you close the trade when the 15min adjusts (ie when the next dialogue box pops up signifying this as of course the 15min will adjust last and that is when the alarm sounds/dialogue box appears - in reality) then that signal - ie an effective buy @ 2571ask achieved +11pips, when the 1402pm alarm/dialogue box appeared saying sell, at what then was 2582bid.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
...just thinking through the logic of this zigzag indicator based potential edge, it seems to me this might do well on strongly trending markets with deep pullbacks, but might get killed in rangy markets, all relative to the time frames you implement it on.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Updated version here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13981425 NOTE: Improved performance... shouldn't get stuck anymore. I'm not sure if this is what the original poster had intended... I merely proposed an approach that worked for me - still in testing.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi, Thanks for the suggestion/invite and data but I'll sit this one out if you don't mind. I really only happened across this thread because the original poster - C row had posted a couple of provocative things on the cable update thread which is where I tend to hang out whilst trading my own edge (on gbpusd only,) and it piqued my interest/curiosity enough to look at his profile. You know how it is? - one click begets another, and before I knew it I was reading this thread. Just some initial observations in addition to and expanding on those I have already made. These are below; a . As mentioned by others in the thread, the thing is crying out for someone to make an EA and backtest then forward test it on say 18 pairings/instruments over an initial 1month period. (Perhaps someone already has/is?) b. I think that your suggested 'close trade' rule of the 15min zigzag adjusting probably happens too late from the small live sample I have seen in real-time, ie it gives too much back. (This initial observation may not be borne out by a bigger sample) Perhaps it should be the 1min zigzag adjusting that closes any open trade. Of course this runs the risk of taking you out of a runner too soon, but so could anything. Perhaps a flat say 30pip stop may be better? c. You can't really optimize risk:reward to it until you know it's winning strike rate over a large forward sample, ie winning trades as a % of total trades. Let's say for the sake of argument it's only 33% then you will need at least a 1:2 risk:reward just to break even. d. As for how your indicator acts, as I mentioned above, in reality it is the 1min zigzag that adjusts 1st, then 5min, then 15min and that gives rise to the green 1 b uy or red 2 sell signal printing at the last 'main' swing lo or hi respectively on the 1min chart, although by then the actual price to buy or sell at will be higher/lower respectively as has been commented above. The exception to this is (and I don't know whether your indicator would print a green 1 or red 2 signal on this occasion,) that let's say there is a strong trend, [a downtrend for eg,] and the red 2 sell signal has already been printed, but then comes an upside pullback sufficient to adjust the 1min or 1min and 5min zigzag(s) to a swing lo, but then the with trend selling starts again before the 15min adjusts to the same swing lo (that would have given a new green 1 buy signal,) and then the 1min -or- 1min and 5min zigzag(s) adjusts again to that pullback hi so that now the 15min, 5min and 1min zigzags are all at a swing hi (albeit at different swing hi's,) - Would your indicator give a fresh red 1 sell signal on the 1min chart? If it doesn't it might be a good idea if it does so that the 'system' gets 'with trend' again. Just some thoughts, and thanks for the work you have done.

Will test it for scalping trades. Could be a very high RR discretionary system if you choose the right pair. If i see a pair on a overbought level at NY close and the daily candle is an indecision candle than i have my pair for scalping based on the OPs 15/5/1 ZigZag strategy.

On gbpusd just now: I have noticed a bit of a lag between walidchidmi 's dashboard 15min red arrow appearing on gbpusd @ 2551bid and samsha786's red 2 signal appearing a few mins later when price was @ 2542bid. So the dashboard, on at least this occasion, gave the earlier signal by 8-10pips. Ie the 1min and 5min were already red arrows on the dashboard they having adjusted first, and then the 15min went red, and on the red 2 signal it would have been the same, the signal being produced when the 15min adjusted, presumably? For clarity's sake: the times in the right-hand side of the alarm dialogue box are broker times and the times in the left-hand side (with the bell next to them) when the alarm dialogue box /alarm actually appears/sounds, are Pc times, (presumably your local time if different from the broker time.) Ie: on the screenshot below it was the 0951am alarm that first produced the signal, the 1000am above it was just me reloading the indy to get the dialogue box to pop up again to take this screenshot.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
On gbpusd: So far , using the 1/5/15min configuration, I have seen 5 signals in realtime that have been produced by Samsha786's red 2 (sell) or green 1 (buy) signal. 4 out of those 5 have shown good pip gain but if closed per his suggested method (when the 15min adjusts,) then the gain was +10 to 20pips on each, averaging +13pips. If using the stop-loss suggestion of under the green 1 or above the red 2, then this stop has been bigger than the average gain when a winner is produced closed by the method discussed above. So as he himself has suggested, and I have commented in a post, those rules need some more development. Only a very small sample so far, and not really representative yet, but an early indication. Anyone else have any recorded results so far?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I have tried with a fixed SL. With the board with all the indications from H1 to M5 in the same color when changing M1 in favor of the TF I have made an operation with TP 25 pips and SL 20 pips. At the moment of 7 operations 6 lost, 1 with little TP. The indicator is currently working fine.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Firstly, Thankyou too to walidchidmi for also sharing his work. There are many ways we can use the stuff being developed here. It may , over a representative forward tested sample (s) prove to be a profitable edge in the market itself, on any particular settings with whatever trade management and risk settings applied. Currently I am using the dashboard to see each successively higher t/f change arrow colour (or not) to help keep me in a trade longer. I tend to be in earlier than the arrow on the dashboard, or indeed the green 1 or red 2 because my edge is essentially based around support/resistance so I get in early @ potential fractal swing points @ potential supp or res. But it 'adds comfort' to PA alone to help me stay in because when the zigzag adjusts on successively higher t/f's, that suggests the swing point might be getting potentially more significant and therefore potentially valid for more pip gain.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
As discussed in my post quoted above, it would seem from walidchidmi's dashboard that when the 1min arrow adjusts to blue (in the case of this downtrend in gbpusd) and then adjusts back to red to be in-line with the red 5min and 15min arrows, another red 2 signal does not appear per samsha786's indy. (Ie when all 1min 5min and 15min arrows are red again.) This also did not happen when the 1 and 5min arrows turned blue then red again in-line with the 15min. So that question seems to be answered . EDIT: another thought occurs, given the above, and the fact that if following samsha786's current exit/take profit rule that this is done when the 15min zigzag adjusts, then this would make it an 'always in the market' system as by then the 1min and 5min zigzags have adjusted also, before the 15min. Also, whether always in the market or not, you have to consider how you are going to handle scheduled event risks like data releases, (see FF calender.)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Update: I have now seen 6 signals in realtime using samsha786,s indy on the 1/5/15min settings on gbpusd, and 5 out of 6 of them have been profitable. Really, using this indy may as well just be the 15min zigzag as it adjusts last after the 1min and 5min so those t/f's are effectively obsolete/not needed. It is the 15min adjustment that creates the signal.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Nice. Though 6 is not much to work with. Nice find that its only the 15min to be checked. True full backtesting of 1000s of past occurrences should then really be easy, right? Data hunting time !

Using the indicator with the original post, that is to say that the signal was on M1 when it was aligned with M5 and M15, today it has not worked well at all, in a market with a strong established trend it can work, with almost everything. But with fixed SL following the trend with today's test it has not given me positive results. What Headland is saying is the opposite? That is, when M1 and M5 have the same color and M15 is aligned last, is that what he means? And the exit? when does a lower TF change?.

Hi, Thanks for the reply and the v.3 indy. Re results, today for eg the 'sell @ 2570' (0839am uk time) red 2 sell signal appeared when the price was actually @ 2553bid and the Buy @ 2411 (1551pm uk time) green 1 buy signal appeared when the price was actually @ 2435ask but both still showed good pip gain within your suggested stop of just beyond the red 2 or green 1 symbol that appears. As for exact times etc, (other than today) because I am not using the indy or the dashboard as an actual buy or sell signal (as explained in a post above) I am not really noting anything exact, just keeping a rough tally of those that showed good pip gain and those that didn't and got stopped out per your suggested stop level. As for the actual suggested take profit - well that has to be developed as we have discussed/noted in posts above, if using it as an entry/exit generator alone. The 15min+ chart conditions in gbpusd since I started noting these in realtime earlier this week have been a very strong down move/bearish trend/sentiment with small pullbacks that haven't generally turned the 15min zigzag the opposite colour thus causing your indy to generate a signal, but may have caused the 1min and 5min to change colour (per the dashboard,) but when the 15min has changed colour and generated a signal per your indy it's been a buy 1 and a deeper pullback has ensued showing good pip gain. Perhaps this strongly trending market has flattered it? EDIT: Actually, I have just scrolled back my gbpusd 1min chart since I started using it yesterday and it has given 12 signals, ie there are 12 red 2 sell or green 1 buy symbols printed. ( I hadn't realised they stay on the chart.) I have seen 6 of them (discussed above) in real-time in the most liquid part of the day when London forex and equities are open, (London morning,) and into the New York forex and equities session, (the effective London afternoon/U.s morning.) This may also be important, ie trading it only when the most liquid sessions are operating perhaps?

Excellent work, thank you for your efforts. Yes, that is how the indy works, ie the 1min zigzag adjusts first (obviously,) then the 5min, and finally the 15min - which generates the green 1 buy or red 2 sell signal. The only exception to this is when 15min and 5min, or just 15min alone is already on say a red 1 sell signal for example, and price pulls back in opposite direction causing the 1min,and/or 5min arrow(s) colour to change to blue, per the dashboard.) Then say price starts going in the direction of the 15min again ie selling, and this causes the arrow colours on the dashboard to change back to red on 1min, and/or 5min...but in any event the indy does not generate a new signal in these circumstances. It is the 15min zigzag change only that generates the signal per the indy the way it currently set-up.

m1 buy signal (with buy arrow on m15 &amp; m5).....11 pips scalp

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Currently, - using the indy, as it presently is, it only generates a signal when 15min zigzag adjusts/changes. So in a strong trend on t/f's above 15min there has to be a deep pullback that changes the 15min arrow colour (and generates a new anti-trend symbol per the indy,) and then back again to the arrow 'trend colour' if the trend continues after the pullback in price to another 'with trend' indy symbol. That is the only way to get involved with a trend as described per the indy. ie there has to be a deep/relatively deep pullback where you may lose on the anti-trend symbol that is produced before the with-trend symbol is produced. At the end of a trend you are likely to suffer too. In the example of the downtrend, If say 5min and 15min are already on say the red arrow (per the dashboard) and the red 2 symbol has been printed per the indy, but 1min and/or 1min &amp; 5min arrows then turn blue in a pull-back by price, but then turn red again as the trend continues after a shallower pullback. Perhaps it would be useful to get a new signal so you can get involved more with any trend? Of course there would be more risk of getting whipped about as well.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Do you mean you have entered the market when the 1min zigzag changed to be in line with the 5min/15min? Ie you used the 1min as your trigger for entry?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I was looking for the continuation of the marked trend in M5 to H1, with the trigger in M1, but when the trend ends and the retracements begin, they are lost with SL, or you have to hold DD until the HTF trend returns.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thankyou for the reply. ...So it would seem on that evidence that reacting to the 1min signal inline trying to get with the longer t/f trend is not very good. It makes you wonder what say reacting to the 15min trying to get with the 1hr/4hr+ trend/dashboard arrow colours is like? Anyways, I had another gbpusd winning signal early this London morning from the indy...it signaled a buy when price was @ 2480ask (saying buy @ 2466 - which was a swing lo,) but no green 1 symbol was placed on chart - probably as the last signal was a buy too with that green 1 symbol placed @ the swing lo @2443. Price has pulled back strongly on gbpusd from yesterday's 2410 lo to a current pullback hi/current dly hi of 2570.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi, Just for clarity for everyone: are those results achieved using the 15min signal?. I must admit having the indy and the dashboard is helping me stay in trades longer, and, actually get involved in some where I was hesitating. For eg price is in a sub 1hr t/f uptrend today so far on gbpusd ...it just pulled back from y/day's 2570 hi and then started buying again. I got an imperfect signal from my own edge to buy after the pullback, but didn't trade it for that reason, but then the red 1min arrow turned blue again and I did enter the market for a small gain. Current state of the gbpusd dashboard is as below.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
It's not the V3 that I published last night. Same indy as before... don't ask me how, but the alert on this one comes up sooner than V3.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks. Well done, and you have 11 different pairings there! Small sample but you seem to have found an effective way to trade it and hi-probability as well.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
It depends on the day, if there is a strong trend without many pullbacks, M1 can be a good trigger. But if the trend stops, the signals cease to be effective because M1 becomes fractals of the correction and not of the continued trend. I will try next week the same with H4, H1 and that M15 is incorporated as a trigger.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks. And that is maybe a/the key to using it? - recognising the chart conditions on t/f's above that you are using as the trigger for entry (ie ranging or trending.) Then adjusting your tactics accordingly.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
This strategy is going to work fine. Can someone help upload a Template with the right setup, including the right indicators

--- 帖子 #129 ---
... another eg of the 1min arrow change to red that helped. Gbpusd 5min below - price tested the potential resistance zone again and began to sell down, I was hesitating but when the 1min arrow changed to red when price was actually 25599 I entered short getting 25591 entry price...only a +3pip scalp on this occasion, but still helped.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
There is currently insufficient evidence (or at least insufficient that has been published here,) to say which way 'works best.' Maybe the original poster Crow knows? (Thanks go to him for alerting us to the possibilities of this indy and for sharing his custom indy based on the zigzag indy.) So, either use his indy on the t/f (s) of choice and do it manually, or use samsha786 's indy (kindly shared,) on the t/f (s) of choice, or indeed use the dashoboard indy posted by and kindly shared by walidchidmi , again on your t/f's of choice.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thank You

...just had only the 2nd shamsha786 indy signal of my trading session on gbpusd with alarm and dialogue box giving a sell @ 2553bid .....interestingly the red arrow on the dashboard came @ 2559bid confirming again that there is a lag between the two. The red 2 sell of the indy symbol is printed @ the current hi of the day on this pairing, @ 2583. 1min gbpusd below

--- 帖子 #133 ---
So, re gbpusd again, the 15min trigger-based indy red 2 sell symbol had printed when price was @ 2553bid (currently price has been down to 2540bid before bouncing up again but it is still within shamsha786's suggested stop of above the red 2 symbol, and this further upside after the drop occurred from the 23.6% fib of y/day's lo - today's current hi move...the 1min then flipped again to blue arrow on the dashboard @ 2554ask. So, despite the fact we have had the 15min red 1 sell symbol printed and the 5min dashboard arrow was also still red I decided to 'get with' the Price action 15min- 1hr uptrend, after the pullback, which I did for a +7pip scalp. I have done well today using the indy and dashboard in conjunction with my own trading edge, but again, like the strong down moves the last few days, the strong up-move today in gbpusd may have flattered it? But for me at least, it is encouraging, and has thus far anyway, (early days) at least seems to 'add something' to my own edge and/or my psychology trading the edge, although this is not proven over a representative sample size of trades yet. I will continue to experiment/work with it whilst continuing to trade my own edge.

Hello, I am trying to load the Multi Zig Zag indicator you posted, as well as the Zig Zag dashboard on to my charts but it is not loading; I've made sure the Start-Level Zig Zag is in the folder, as you've indicated too. Do you know what the problem could be?

This is the original indicator shared by CROW here (ZIG_ZAG_STARTLEVEL): https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...gzag-3-windows I created my own indicator using data from CROWS indicator (MultiZigZag): https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post13983419 This indicator takes care of aligning the M1, M5 and M15 timeframes. On alert of a signal, I take the trade. That's it!

That signal described above gave a max profit of between 28 and 23pips depending on whether you went with the dashboard or the indy that produces the red 2 sell symbol. Re gbpusd again, the 3rd signal of the day re the 15min trigger came when price was @ 3548ask when the green 1 buy symbol was printed by samsha786 's indy, slightly earlier re the 15min arrow change to blue on walidchidmi's (version 1) dashboard when price was @ 2542 ask. The green 1 buy symbol per the indy is printed @ the swing lo of 2530 and so far price has seen a hi of 2614, so a maximum +72pips available from that within samsha786 's suggested stop level of just below the green 1 symbol, (take profit and trade management technique/tactic allowing.) So, all 3 indy signals re the 15min trigger have been profitable today, theoretically, but of course the extent to which depends on your trade management/take profit method. Certainly the (initial) stop suggestion area by samsha786 seems very sensible. For me, on gbpusd only, on signals generated by the indy in realtime, in the most liquid parts of the trading day (as discussed in a previous post) I have seen 9 signals generated by the indy in real-time, 8 of which were profitable in terms of pips available for profit, take profit/trade management technique/tactic allowing. A small sample so far-yes, and not representative yet, but a promising one with an 89% winning rate so far. Will be interesting to see how it performs when the market is rangy, not trending with big pullbacks. Perhaps it might turn out that if using the 15min trigger one should do so only when the 1hr(+) is trending, and if it is ranging, use the 5min trigger? Time will tell. Gbpusd 1Hr below shows where these signals today have placed the green 1 buy, and red 2 sell symbols per the indy. You can see that it has been a strongly bullish day, much like the 2 days before it which were strongly bearish and on which I have been monitoring this in real-time.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanks for the analysis Headland... I had good fun today. Very high win rate. I tried all pairs including gold and silver. I too wonder if the market conditions were right today and on a different given day, the results might be the opposite. As you say... time will tell. For now, very promising.

There was a 4th and final gbpusd signal (in real-time) yesterday per the 15min trigger generated by the dashboard and indy. I did see it just as I was coming away from the desk last London evening. The indy placed the red 2 sell symbol @ 2614 swing hi, and it printed and gave the alarm/dialogue box when price was @ 2593bid. The 15min dashboard arrow turned red slightly earlier @ 2598bid. Max pips available up to the market close for the weekend was +28. So for me on gbpusd since I started monitoring it (on this gbpusd pairing only) on the 15min trigger, in real-time, on Weds, there have been 10 signals re the 15min trigger and 9 have shown profit. That is a 90% winning rate - in strongly trending 30min/ 1Hr (+) market conditions with few in number but when they did happen, - big pullbacks. Still not a representative sample size yet, but it probably gives a good indication of the type of performance it may give in these higher t/f (than the trigger t/f) market conditions . Of course there remains I think the matter of getting the take profit/trade management optimized, but it seems on this evidence so far that samsha786 's suggestion of putting the stop just beyond the green1 buy or red 2 sell signal symbol generated by the indy, is about right. And that, I strongly suspect, and as voiced by samsha786 as well, will be the real killer for this indy if trying to trade 15min signals in a 1Hr (+) ranging market. Look at the gbpusd 1Hr screenshot below - a ranging market - will the 15min trigger perform so well in these conditions? I doubt it, which is why it may be better to drop down to a 5min, (maybe even a 1min trigger?) in these market conditions. We'll see. For those hoping to develop a profitable EA based around this zigzag logic, as put forward by the original poster/thread starter Crow, you may want to consider allying it to something like the adx indicator (average directional index) as well, to determine when a market is trending or ranging, and thus determine which t/f trigger is more appropriate,? should our suspicions re the 15min trigger in a 30min/ 1Hr (+) rangy market be borne out. Of course these are not the only t/f's and the same would be true of say a 1hr trigger in a 4hr (+) trending or ranging market, and dropping down to a 15min trigger when it ranges...etc etc...

--- 帖子 #151 ---
What we know so far; (Please feel free to add to this list,) - it is in no particular order 1. Walidchidmi's dashboard arrows change at the same time as crow's indicator. S amsha786 's alert/dialogue box indy and red 2 sell or green 1 buy symbols appear a few pips later. 2. There are effectively two 'main' ways to trade this. a. Assuming a 15min trigger - (it could be any t/f) The 1min zigzag will adjust first, then the 5min, then the 15min and it is the longer t/f (15min) that generates the alert re samsha786 's indy. He has published just a 'one t/f' indy in this respect (v.3) but suggests that the up to v.2 indy suffers less of a lag than the v.3 (as described above.) b. Trade the shorter t/f trigger adjustment when the next 2 t/f's are showing one/the same direction. So for example, (and using this 1min, 5min, 15min t/f combo,) when the 5min and 15min are showing say a sell, then wait for the 1min to adjust to a sell and enter the market in the direction of 5/15min. Currently, samsha78 6's published indy does not accommodate this unless you put the indy on all t/f's, and await the shorter t/f alert. [Theoretically, this could be done in the indy inputs on 1min: by entering 1min, 1min, 1min, 5min: by entering, 1min, 1min, 5min, and on 15min: by entering 1min, 5min, 15min. (?)] Alternatively use crow's indy on all 3 t/f's, or indeed walidchidmi's dashboard arrows. 3. Re published info on this thread - there is currently small sample indicative evidence to suggest this indy/method/logic per a. above (on 15min trigger) performs well in strongly trending 1Hr (+) markets with deep pullbacks, in the most liquid parts of the trading day. 4. There is currently conflicting published evidence on the b. method of trading it. NB: Of course with this evidence published, we don't absolutely know the 'competence' of the user and/or what stop/take profit/trade management technique has been used to obtain it. 5. The stop placement suggestion by samsha786 , ie just beyond the swing hi or lo on the trigger t/f for method a, (and presumably method b?) seems good thus far. 6. The original poster/thread starter crow suggests/uses method b, and further using suggests what he calls ' oscillator filters ' to enhance the signals/results obtained from them. 7. I would suggest that the evidence so far published may be indicative, but is not yet representative, so be wary of anyone 'raving' about it yet lol!

Great results samsha786 , thanks for posting. I won't address this directly to you because you have said you have finished contributing to the thread. Here are the stats; (assuming the gain total shown is gross of the commissions total shown.) Total trades: 85 Total winning trades 75 Total Losing trades 10 Total gain +238.1pips gross, +206.7pips net of commissions. Win rate 88.2% Longest winning run of trades 34 Longest losing run of trades 2 Average win trade +4.24pips gross Average losing trade -8.66pips gross Biggest winner +24.5pips gross Biggest Loser -19.3pips gross Expectancy per trade +3.28pips gross Although average loser is greater than average winner, there is a very high win rate and a positive expectancy, and the biggest winner was bigger than the biggest loser. (Outliers?) Your chances of having 3 consecutive losses are less than 1%, and 3 is likely to be the longest maximum consecutive losing run of trades. (Doesn't mean to say one or both of these metrics can't be exceeded, just that these are the probabilities.) Let's assume for the sake of the argument that your sample of 85trades is representative (notwithstanding our recent discussions on this matter re trending/ranging markets,) then you could be fairly aggressive with risk, given the sample stats. I would advise that It probably isn't for at least these reasons, but may be very indicative. Some say that to get a 'really accurate' picture, one should remove any outliers , ie biggest winner (s) and loser (s) if they are way bigger than the averages, then run the stats again.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
As you say, it's still too early to know if it gives a real advantage, but for now the data shared by you and samsha786 is pretty good. Yesterday I visited the thread you describe and I encourage you to continue contributing as it is interesting. As for the indicator, which hasn't been tested for long enough and my knowledge is limited, I see that it can give good signals in a trending market and will hurt ranges unless filtered with something to keep us out in these ranges.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Some real gold nuggets here!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
With Headland's basic but extremely important insights, many approaches can be developed. For example, certain strats that work better in trending mode, a too close and diverging MA + larger MA (example:*4) is all it takes to lower the bad trades just enough. Sometimes, that is also the time to range trade against the zig zag or whichever indi. As long as it is optimized by going through enough occurrences (1000s) in the past of course.

Sorry, can't help with the above. Just to be clear though (taking the instructions from the indys/dashboard developers) a . Zig_Zag_StartLevel indy (by crow) works on it's own. b. The MultiZigZag indy ( by samsha786) needs the indy in a) above to be in your MQL4&gt;Indicators folder. c. The Zig_DasF_MTF dashboard ( by walidchidmi) needs the indec_zig_dash indy to be in your MQL4&gt;Indicators folder. ------------------------------------------ Today there has only been only one signal from the 15min MultiZigzag indy (b above) and it came @ 0910am Uk time when price was @ 2573bid. Although the alert dialogue box said 'sell @ 2588,' this is obviously when the dashboard arrow and (a) above changed. The indy didn't place a red 2 symbol on the chart - the 2nd time I have noticed this in my forward testing sample so far monitoring it.) This is presumably because like the last time it happened, there has been no intervening green 1 buy symbol generated and the red 2 symbol from Friday @2614 was still 'valid?' This signal too ended in profit and so this makes a winning rate of 10 out of 11 in my sample so far using the 15min trigger on gbpusd only.

First, I'd like to say thank you to Crow for sharing this wonderful indicator! Thank you also to everyone who contributes to this thread. I'm very new to this and demo trading. I'm using this system: when both 15m and 5m are in the same direction, wait for 1m to turn (back) to the same direction and enter. (my understanding of Crow's first post) I'm using Crow's indicator zig_zag_startlevel and MultiZigZag v3. I entered a profitable demo trade today. After the buy signal appeared, I waited for price to break above the last zigzag high (drawn by MultiZigZag v3) and retest the support level (drawn by zig_zag_startlevel). This enabled a small SL of a little more than 3 pips. I closed the trade late for about 1:3 risk:reward, but could easily been 1:4. Sorry for not screen-shooting beforehand.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Well done. I took the same trade on gbpusd actually and it came after a signal from my own edge below it at the swing point but I wasn't sure about it until the red 1min arrow on the dashboard turned blue again in line with the 5/15min arrows. As we already know, the arrows on the dashboard / zigzagstartlevel indy set-up before the multizigzag indy. I have seen 3 of these 1min arrow changes back to the 5/15 (+) direction/arrow colour in my trading session so far this London morning, and all 3 have been profitable. --------------------------------------- Re the 15min triggers on the multizigzag indy on gbpusd only - there was one during the Uk overnight (the asian session) which was profitable, but I won't count that as I didn't see it in real-time and it's not in the most liquid part of the trading day. 3 signals so far this London morning. 2 have been profitable one is ongoing, although the dashboard / zigzagstartlevel has already seen profit. The 15min swing point for this is 2555, (where the multizigzag indy printed a red 2 sell symbol,) and these gave the signal when price was @ 2540bid, the multizigzag indy @ 2526bid. So 12 out of 13 profitable on this 15min trigger so far in my sample which began last weds 27th april. PS: By profitable - I mean seen at least a 1:1 R:R based on samsha786 's suggestion of having the stop just beyond the red 2 sellor green 1 buy symbol printed by his multizigzag indy.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Just a suggestion based on what I have seen so far re the 1min arrow change on the dashboard and/or 1min zigzag adjust on the zigzagstartlevel indy, back in direction/colour of the 5/15(+) arrow colours: the stop is the swing point (ie where the zigzag adjusts to,) and the take profit is when the 1min arrow changes colour again ?? EDIT: Also of the 12 out of 13 profitable multizigzag indy 15min signals I have seen on gbpusd, the dashboard arrow change was profitable but if going with the multizigzag indy alert which alerts later, then on 1 out of 13 was not profitable.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
HI, Yess, + 1 And where is Crow ? Cheers jf

--- 帖子 #170 ---
That's now 13 out of 14 profitable (as described in a post above) on the 15min trigger re gbpusd since weds 27th april (noticed in real-time) during most liquid parts of trading day, using multizigzag alert as the trigger for entry. Another way of getting involed in the trend may be (I have no representative sample empirical evidence to support this,) if the next higher t/f (S) to 15min change colour re the dashboard arrow? On this trade for eg 30min/1hr dashboard arrows were blue when the 15min arrow turned red, but then the 30min turned red @ 2518bid. EDIT: That's my trading session finished. I am going on hols this London evening so will not be contributing to this thread for 3 weeks. If it is still active when I get back I will carry on reporting my 15min trigger sample (etc) if this has not allready been superseded by others' postings with representative samples of empirical evidence (making it superfluous,) of their experience using the methodology described in this thread/tools kindly attached to it. Good Luck all.

missed this entry around 1.2528 about 1.5 hours ago. possible entry at candle close of inverse hammer candle (black arrow), after pullback. (was a previous support turned into resistance) IMHO aggressive SL just above candle. conservative SL above horizontal line.

Walidchidmi, I see following logs , is that an error :

This indicator would be killer if it would show: - alert feed - no of bars back signal occurred Some examples.

..sat @ airport about to go on hols. I saw another 15min trigger multizigzag indy in real-time today as I was still @ desk earlier with charts open. The indy placed the green 1 buy symbol @ the 2493 swing point, the dashboard arrow changed to blue @ 2512ask, and the indy gave the alert when price was @ 2527ask. The signal saw at least 1:1 R:R if stop put just beyond that symbol. The next one, I didn't see in realtime, The indy then placed the red 2 sell symbol @ the 2567 swing point and the 15min arrow seems to have changed @ 2540bid so I assume the multizigzag indy gave the alert some pips later (around 10 usually so circa 2530.) The signal saw at least 1:1 R; R if stop put just beyond that symbol. Anyways, 14 out of 15 profitable (on gbpusd ) in forward testing sample now, using the l15min, trigger on the multizigzag indy. 15 out of 16 profitable (ie one not seen in real-time today as described above) using the indy in the most liquid parts of the trading day (ie London morning into London afternoon/U.s morning. 1hr gbpusd is rangy today, and overall as well at the moment, but with good swings.

Is there anyone here who can recommend a similar indicator to the Multi ZIG ZAG indicator? I've tried to load it on my chart with no success. I would like to try this strategy in full; that is the only missing component and I do feel its needed. Any suggestions? Is there anyone here who can recommend a similar indicator to the ZIG ZAG

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I too have the same problem of not being able to load the Multi ZigZag onto the chart.........Is there a .dll thats required, although I would not think so.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
The problem : #1. You have created a sub-folder, you named it Zig Zag Strat. Solution : #1. Copy all indicators from your sub-folder, Zig Zag Strat, and paste then on Indicator folder. #2. Use updated MultiZigZag v3 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

not bad, spontaneously scalping.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Wow! Really spontaneous Which time frame are you using?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Great! I took a similar trade with 2 entries. (I only trade DEMO atm ) first, when i saw the 1M signal (green arrow). second entry was when price pulled back a little to a support/resistance level in 1M chart. first trade closed late, for ~ 1:1 Risk:Reward (could've been 1:2) second trade, moved SL to BE+ and let it run, hoping price moves towards ~1.2550s. seems my SL of ~5 pips is too big, and should have put SL at the signal's green horiziontal level.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
great results!!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Well done! Just a bit of suggestion, you may also swing in Higher timeframe overview for a better confident in holding the trade. Dont' just stuck in M15/M5/M1. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see from the chart above, there is a super nice zone for buying and the potential is way above there. You can hold for a bigger movement with your small stoploss style.

Got very confused . Don't you have to wait for m15 to be buy , m5 to be buy and then wait for a pullback on m1 and enter when m1 is buy ? The indi above send alerts for buy even if m15 is sell ...

'Scanner' for the system. No need for other indicators on folders to work. If you select 'Working mode' for List or Market Watch mode, only setting it up on one chart is enough. If you set a List (most fx crosses only) and broker uses suffixes on instrument names, add manually in order to be recognized. The other working modes do not need suffix info. Only pop-up alerts.

Sick35 thanks mate for the alerts indicator. One request that I would appreciate is being able to disable the alerts when not trading with either an on/off button on the chart or the ability to turn them on/off within the indicators settings.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
The trend starts from lower timeframes. Therefore, even if it shows a trend on the higher timeframe, it can actually start moving in the other direction, that is, make a reversal. Therefore, the readings of this indicator may be useless. There are just coincidences and you successfully enter the trade, but not thanks to the indicator.

How can this work ? Yesterday I got an live sell alert almost 20 pips from the swing high . Right where I placed the red line:

The first true post in this thread, right, it's crap and it's coincidence...casino...an acquaintance wrote me that he had contact with Crow and he even told him it was all casino. If you watch what Crow builds here at FF, you might think he will sooner or later switch to the commercial users here, or is he already and no one notices... one cannot live from the donation calls in the indicators alone. You also pay attention to his links to Telegram Here is a good tip that a very experienced trader gave me: It's not the levels or something else in the market, IT'S ONLY YOU. You have to understand this first! In order to move the market, Institutions needs to deploy their huge orders and when they got enough orders filled, market turns around and moves. We don't know where and when. Forget about indicators, fibo or support resistance or any other retail crap. Do your own plan and draw on your chart where you will try to take order, put your stop and practice, plan and practice. Look for the thread of TRD and learn there because there is a lot of good information with charts and explanations! I have a description of him, attach it.

Thanks for sharing the results. Can you roughly explain what do barn, length and length2 mean? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
BarN = Number of bars used to draw the Blue zigzag. If you trading the M15 timeframe, stick with 96 hours - that's a full day, don't need more than that unless you want to see historical data. Length = Number of bars used to search for swing highs and swing lows. Shorter length - more signals, longer length - fewer signals, but more reliable. Length2 = Same concept as length, except this is the value that gets used on a M1 chart only. So in short, zigzag will be drawn for BarN bars, swing high and low will be determined by Length bars, but if it's a M1 chart it will be determined by Length2 bars. Stick with M15 timeframe... don't bother with the others, in my opinion. This is not a double zigzag as some others have pointed out or shared earlier... again, complete lack of understanding. See below - we avoided an unnecessary trade with Length 10: EURUSD - Length 6 Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURUSD - Length 10 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This method actually uses ZigZag and just takes the z1-z2 phase orientation. ZigZag ZRP only draws z1-z2 when ZigZag appears z0-z1. This can be found in strategy tester, Or read ZigZag ZRP indicator source code directly Therefore, we just use ZigZag. if z0&gt;z1 buy, if z0&lt;z1 sell. that's all.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
"Stick with M15 timeframe", is it just use 1 M15 chart instead of use 3 different timeframe charts?

Base on the chart, I can see some dotted lines, which I assume is the fibo levels. But I don't want to assume as I know what is the meaning of "assume". If can ask the poser, which is you, why not? Also the lines and arrows will show up regardless of the fibo settings? So the fibo levels are for manual entries?

Dear Samsha786 (- thanks so much for the added value to this thread! ) or anyone else willing to clarify : I'm probably not looking at it right - but to me the fib levels seem a bit off: the 0% looks right - at the swing high/low but the 100% (or 1) doesn't look like it's placed correctly... ? Any input is really appreciated

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Study and combine and just do it!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Use it best without this fibo, for this you should know. It is an extension (google it) The more there is in the chart, the more confusing it becomes. Maybe you combine it with volume and watch for divergences on these along with Bears Bulls. Just my personal opinion.

Perhaps you can give a bit of information about the timeframes you want it calculated, seems like there are 2 persons trying to help you have different interpretations of what you looking for. walidchidmi is looking at calculating the strength for each timeframe as you can see from his diagram, while samsha786 has just one overall strength for each currency. You looking at the strength for each currency for all timeframes added in total (e.g. AUD Strength = its M1 Strength + M5 Strength + M15 Strength + M30 Strength + H1 Strength + H4 Strength + D1 Strength) or you looking at a particular timeframe only?

walidchidmi Thank you for your effort. i controlled m1 m5 and m15 tf. that works. now we need to find how to use this indicator. i have 2 plan to try. i explain. 1st plan use original strategy with this indi. what was that. if m1 m5 and m15 has buy signal we buy and vice versa. i use this method to find by sum signals m1, m5 and m15 signals. Attached Image (click to enlarge) you see our 1st money to sell is USD(-21 point) and 1st money to buy is NZD(+15 point) Attached Image (click to enlarge) this yellow area must be a good long opportunity. at that area we could wait m1 buy signal or follow pa methods.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
by the way There may be some drawbacks to this method. most important drawbacks is timing. maybe it works great daily close time maybe london open maybe newyork open maybe mid time of london session i dont know without trying. but this drawback is valid for original method too. it's a fact here we find the best currency.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
oh i understand thank you.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
It is indicating the strongest trend that exists in the pairs, so it can be tested on some price pullback, relying on S/R, or place the m1 indicator and wait for a change in favor of the trend that marks the sum /higher subtraction, break of LT in favor of the trend... It will be a matter of testing.

Can you modify this indicator to not produce constant messages? Brokers will not like it after a certain amount of messages. Thanks

--- 帖子 #322 ---
hi walidchidmi your work very smart.i have error this indicator chart attachment time broker server connection very slowed.mt4 also stuck. can not use this on my i3 computer,very higher ram used can you fix it thank you.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
firstly i use correlation. eur did today up moving a lot of time but chf did not. genrally chf follow eur eur follow chf. after this 1st knowledge. Go to PA below chart. we have high and 1 number bar break high but cannot break 1 number bar for a long time. in this outlook it is bullish but if price can break easily that bar.(not strng) after failed attempts reveal 2 number bar that was bearish bar. and not close above that bar. so high probability there will be bullish trap and go down by my theory. these type of trades makes a lot of money. because you dont see your entry price again in this type. this is 2nd knowledge i multiply my account 5 times this is 3rd knowledge. so worth to tryi lose nothing) i close my all trades. combine thse 3 knowledge and enter trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You are wellcome. I did my trades based on nzdusd signal. Find currency wait retrecament add some pa. Booommm I use pa not only signal. let's strain our minds What was currency nzd buy usd sell I give you secret. Think if nzd buy and usd sell, that create domino effect. If another currency tell us vice versa best currency change automatically If another money have buy outlook against new zealand dollar for example if audnzd long best currency will be audusd Another maney sell outlook against usd for example if gbpusd short best currency will be gbp nzd. I think it is clear

it cant be because if one of them is 21 other ones cant be 21. if one money take 7 points that means 2nd one can be max 5 points because 7 point match give that -1 point

this is history. for example if eurusd 42 point 6 hours ago. we open chart if retrecament completed we enter trade.

take profit decision is on your own decision. my advise if you use small tf use smal tp, bigger tf use bigger tp. we find best currency generally work by your entery side so you can scalp too

I always read your posts in keen interest. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us. I like that you introduce the idea of currency strength to this, before that this strategy is mainly focused on GBPUSD, now it had become more versatile and interesting. You bring great value to this thread =) A big thank you from me. And also thank you to all the programmers who developed the tools for the rest, in the midst of your own trading, you still find time to program, this is not easy and takes a lot of sacrifice, so thank you for that too.

So I have attached the template_All Group desplay.tpl and got the below picture. Attached Image (click to enlarge) From there EUR is strongest (+13) and USD is weakest (-15).

Thanks for that. Yes both versions of Multi ZigZag now working again instead of freezing MT4! Thank you Crow.

Thanks for this walidchidmi. The template_All Group desplay.tpl seems very slow to load and uses lots of CPU power to the point MT4 nearly freezes. Dragging new currency into the MT4 window also takes a long time. Just thought I'd let you know. Hope you don't mind.

i try this type of strength indicator many times. there is common problem with this. there is no reference point. what is that point. if you buy strong and sell weak maybe that currency at top level so you lose money. i have to many investigation about forex. i found strange things. For example, let me tell you one 1,4307 and 0,6990 level is so imortant. you can multiply by 10,100,1000,10000,100000 etc. 14,307 143,07 1430,7 14307..... 6,99 69,90 699 6990...... you can add any currency indices and metals. these levels act as support and resistence. i named this RPL(rich person leve). because rich people perefer these levels.

P.Action Bro i'm new at this thread i'm trying to test it with fear but i need to know when you take profits or stop loss

--- 帖子 #450 ---
it depends on your trading style my mate. if you scalping 2 of them must be small. if you swing trader they must be high. when i am scalping like morning trade the are small. this is basic question. it covers everything. how can i answer everything ?

we have a saying here. Fear has no children. dont be afraid. There is a lot of video which tells entery tp and stop loss. our case is finnding consistent strategy. If you don't take a step, it won't be in your own strategy. you have everthing you need open a demo account and test yourself.

amazing result, congratz, keep going having read all thread, seems not many people discuss the mindset and edge behind this trading strategy. bro you seem manage to apply it very sucessfully, can you by any chance tell a bit about it? i can only see it's about multi timeframe collaboration, when three timeframe show same small trend it's highly likely to continue for a span of time. how zigzag is modified and why so high accuracy i am curious.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I see you are trading without a stop! What do you do when it goes against you?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Everyone thinks it was thanks to the indicator. get this out of your head. I know price action. The indicator just tells me which parity it is. I also manage my money. My account may explode. because I took too much of the money I earned. This gives me comfort. In short, I am trying to do whatever makes sense for forex. This is not just a graph and indicator.

Maybe you are right. But if you talk like this i ask you. What you share. I am scalping now how can i analyse this. I told evrthing what i do. I sent a lot of graph. Which works. Now nzd pair should make new high. I bought that.

We buy possibilty. We should find best possibilty. We can lose in that situation. We do best market gives. If not give us there is nothing to do

--- 帖子 #483 ---
If you have time after trading, I am interested in your NZDJPY entry analysis because your entry point is very precise and spot on after a sharp retracement. My dilemma is I don't know how much retracement it should be before it resumes its upward motion, but your entry is exact on the spot . I would be keen in your price action analysis for this one if you have time..If no time, no worries, I understand.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
What do I share? I've been trading for 20 years. I can share my experience. But if I don't understand what you are doing (read my post question 2) I cannot contribute. Let's understand well mine wants to be a constructive criticism. I can go on trading another 20 years without you. I repeat if you share ideas and methods all together everything makes sense otherwise I am not interested in what a single person does. Remember that FF has this mission. Look for example at what PAT Chico and other great traders do and you will understand. Everyone has their own method but they all share and explain the method in every detail.

It is not my purpose to write here what will satisfy you. look here, 1 indicator has been shared in the 1st post. but this indicator was not useful. I made this useful. I did this in front of everyone. and everyone has this indicator. so I would appreciate if you don't criticize me about sharing. You wrote something about yourself. I don't want to judge you, but I didn't get anything from you. You can't criticize me when this is the case. please do like me and take screenshots when entering and exiting the trade.

Good morning to all! First and foremost, thank you to each of you for your contributions. While I understand and do agree that the methodology could be a little confusing at first, I think we should all recognize that it's new to everyone and that everyone is likely sharing what they know with each other as they learn. Let's keep gratitude front and center throughout this discussion. I think we can start a new thread after we've gathered all the information that will be a little bit more organized. Have a great day everyone.

It is very difficult to both write something here and trade. I guess it would be more difficult to open a new thread. But I guess the criticism demands it. I know it's impossible to please everyone. because everyone's expectations are different. it's very natural. I already do what is asked of me to be done, but it is not enough. why is this so. because expectations are wrong. so what. I will give you 2 or 3 sentences and everyone will have learned everything completely. it's really tiring. My comments are not for you. Not to anyone personally. my brainstorm.

Thanks to P.Accion for sharing ideas and to walidchidmi for his hard work. One more question P.Action, knowing that the indicator only gives you a general knowledge on the pairs, and the indicator, as is logical, on many occasions the number it marks is high/low and in a few minutes it changes, how do you manage the entries when they are not in favor, establish a global SL, change of the indicator in M1, change in structure?...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
look my friend i tell you what i am doing. firstly i found which mone bought which money sell. (indicator tel us this.)(example i am not afraid selling usd or cad last hours. i am not afraid buying nzd and gbp last hours) after that i am waiting retrecement sometimes sometimes i enter momentum. i follow lowest and highest point of currencies. after that i calculate what target can be. by the way if you look at my charts there is support and resistence levels. every levels mean different importance. i have to decide to enter trade i follow these steps. it takes times.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Thanks for the quick reply. I'll take a closer look at what you say. And if the steps are not fulfilled, you close looking for a balance and another pair.

I think the problem is that this thread has changed from one offering simple tools to enable us to make easier trading decisions, to one concerning complicated technical analysis. It seems to have moved away from the simplicity of Crow's initial post, and the very useful additions from the likes of Samsha786 and walidchidmi.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
so what do you suggest?

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Ideally, keep it nice and simple and get back to basics.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) yes it is up but anyway gbpchf down too. so i gain more nzdchf according to gbpchf.

Thanks PAction, now I understand why some of your entry points are very precise and spot on

--- 帖子 #536 ---
People, take time to read through all the postings from the beginning, there are many gems and knowledge sharing that occurred before. Basically some people eventually uses Crow's method, but as far as I see, most of them added a certain element of discretionary analysis to it, some added divergence, some added some oscillator/volume, some added simple price action, all of them have shared, Crow's method suits some, but not all. I myself have tested Crow's method, so I fully understand why PAction added the currency strength analysis, because I too encountered some problems with only Crow's method alone, basically you have to test yourself and eventually find what suits you most. If Crow's method suits you, then go ahead. If PAction's way suits you, then go ahead, trading is an individual game, not every trading style suits everyone, eventually you have to test yourself, and find your own way And of course, take time to read through the past postings, since everyone here is focused on trading, no one really has time to keep repeating themselves.

Dear walidchidmi, Could you please take a look: why 2 indicators based on ZZ with the same settings show different signals on the same TF (sell with the rose arrow by the original topicstarter's indicator and buy with the blue positive number 5 for the M15 TF by dash3timeframe) Thank you for your work and time!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Now I'm curious what happens! Where are your stops or exit levels if it falls more?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
i stooped thanks for your worry. i withdrawed yesterday again. sometimes we lose money. There's nothing can be done. it's in the nature of this business. anyway i gained to much money. no head off. see you next week. have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
last friday to this friday I earned 12 times my money. it is great result. if my aud plan works maybe it can be 20 times. so withdraw was important. i did it so I have protected myself.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Was that level too risky to buy?I should stay longer....Thank you for all that you share, do you have some new ideas regarding zigzag? You said something in the previous post...Personally, i still can not connect about it... @eess said really true in this post https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...7#post14006167

--- 帖子 #555 ---
It's good that you reminded me. I am currently free. The idea that comes to my mind is not related to zigzag, maybe it can be combined. I explain my new idea in the next post. You'll think it's a brilliant idea. Let's get started my friends.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
hello pls I need an alarm When the arrow appears thanks

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Firstly i give you some example. send some blank chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) look at my highligted bars. they have common property. huge bar right? but maybe you havent seen other common properties. that is our case. and we win money from that. but this method has some rule and rules should not be broken. second and important common property is next bar. if you look next bar that bar has small wick opposite way. and continue main trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) so we can use this. there is huge RR. example if we use 1:4 if we enter 4 times and 3 are wrong 1 is true we are at breakeven point. if you look first chart there is trade 1 is wrong 3 is ok. so if we risk 100usd per trade we gain 3 trade 1:4 so gain 1200usd we loss 1 trade -100usd so totally we gained 1100usd. here is method and rules. we have 28 pairs we find maximum percentage bar and currency. minimum percentage bar an currency. which one is bigger we use that. example maximum percentage bar +%0.30 audusd minimum percentage bar -%0.27 gbpcad we use audusd. example maximum percentage bar +%0.42 eurusd minimum percentage bar -%0.45 gbpnzd we use gbpnzd. we enter trade new bar open. we enter stop loss first bar length/5 and tp 4 times so rr is 1:4 and we do nothing. we use thi method volatility times. example london session.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
so idea is from me. i need coders helping. they make ea as i said rule they test it and we look results. we share this with everyone. we must help people at the cost of the gains we make who with me. by the way this is different thing this doesnt cover this thread subect. so i could open a thread and we continue at there. your ideas are important. What do you say.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Very clear the examples that you put yesterday P.Action, without a doubt the correlation that you use is very positive. The way of placing the positions in a massive grid type is curious, but come on, if you win more times than you lose, with a good path in profits and inflection points... it is a winning strategy.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
and so?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
We can try to see how it works You can open a new thread and thus different ideas are not mixed in the current one.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Thanks for the idea. What do you mean find a minimum percentage bar? If they are minimum, they cannot compare which one is bigger one another. Are you referring to Bear bar for minimum; bull bar for maximum? We look for H1 tf for 28 pairs, and EA opens one trade for bigger bar pair hourly? For SL, does bar length/5 include wick or just a bar body size? example maximum percentage bar +%0.42 eurusd minimum percentage bar -%0.45 gbpnzd we use gbpnzd.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
It's not a winning strategy, it's Casino! Let's assume you open your securities account today and start trading with this strategy. You open your positions in AUD USD as before (See post 549), hoping to make a profit. Now you see that it runs against you. You get nervous but hope that the price will turn, you will not close. Very many traders have a problem with closing their positions in the negative. They hope for a reversal, according to the motto hope dies last. It is not a good strategy if it does not include a stop loss. I can not subscribe to this kind of trading, as it shows P.Action here, and warn everyone to imitate this! Especially if you are a beginner, you should avoid this kind of trading.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
absolute value my friend. we find bigger move it is not importan up or down movement.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
you are right too. I can't wait for everyone to participate. Everyone should go with their own method. i saw my fault at audusd. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #566 ---
By the way, I would like to point out with all my transparency that when you win over and over again, you always feel like you will win all the time. I guess it's because we're human. nobody is perfect.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
To set a rule and formula for EA to find a bigger bar among 28 pairs H1, For example GBPJPY 22 pips EURUSD 12 pips AUDUSD 15 pips GBPJPY is the biggest bar, and how we calculate maximum minimum percentage bar for EA, I mean compare to what to get + or - percentage movement. Or do you mean to compare movement with two previous bars bar(1) and bar(2) of the same pair to get a movement percentage, and find the highest percentage among 28 pairs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #568 ---
My post has nothing to do with you personally! I just wanted to warn one or the other here to trade something like this without perhaps having a plan of what you are doing.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
It is not maximum. You calculate "(close-open)/open" Pip value is not important audusd 7 pips nearly same 11 pips eurusd.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
You are wellcome my friend. No problem.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
That's clear and makes sense.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
You could use a percentage of the average of the values of the previous day, of several days, of 100, 200 candles, etc, to have a large objective data with respect to a period of time. The values of this form would be updated in times of high/low voltatility by itself, in addition to being values applied to each currency.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
maybe this calculation help us. avarage+1 standart deviation can be limited.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
here is example. i did this for 1 day london session. for this example we add 1 case so we have 2 cases. if statement can be used. if bar is maximum and if percentage is bigger than this value. enter trade. so maximum bar is smaller then ((avarage+std deviation) dont open trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I suggest that calculation in relation to ADR is maybe better. Otherwise high volatile pairs (e.g. GBPJPY) will always be the pairs with highest pip changes

--- 帖子 #576 ---
because of that we dont use pip value. we use percentage.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hello everyone and excuse my English. Returning to the subject of this thread, is anyone still using the original parameters? for example those of samsha 786 that from what I have read 19monza64 adopt?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
even if you use percentage there is still big difference between different pairs P.Action: I would recommend to open new threat with this topic, otherwise this nice zigzag threat gets very confusing....

--- 帖子 #579 ---

Hi there @ PAction Been following you in this Forum &amp; appreciate your input &amp; I must say very impressive results, Every traders dream, just wish I could emulate those returns. Can you clarify how your using/incorporating the "Dash 3 Timeframe" indicator into your analysis &amp; trading decisions But that's not why I am messaging you to be honest. To show you my appreciation for your input I would like to share with you &amp; everyone else here a fully optioned breaker block indicator which is IMHO superior to anything else available out there to thank you. I hope it helps

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi walidchidmi, thanks a lot for your hard work, may I know the time display as I highlighted in yellow in my screenshot below (21/5/2022 3:52) is according to what kind of timing, Broker, GMT or otherwise? On my side, doesn't seem to be the same as my Broker candle timing.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi PAction, I'm keen to know how you intend to use this latest dash by walidchidmi to select the currency to focus on. I check back your past posting, you mentioned that your target is the Yellow Highlighted in your excel spreadsheet, where you logged down the currency pair with greatest Max-Min over 4 hour interval. In your spreadsheet, for example, you logged down - 08:00 EURUSD - 04:00 EURNZD - 11:00 GBPJPY So for these 3 currency highlighted, do you focus on them for the same day, or you focused on them for the next day? The rest I know what you will do, you will look at the price action of the selected currency focused on, wait for retracement etc. I just want to know the highlighted currency is to focus for your same day trading or next day trading? Thanks!

Everyone is entitled to an opinion... here's mine. This thread has been hijacked... a promising system found it's way here, unfortunately due to a lack of control and the original OP basically disappearing.... this thread has taken a different form, some have taken advantage of this and the original essence has been lost. The attention to this thread is driving other agendas. Since there is alot of attention on this thread and others are lazy to start a new thread, I've decided to dedicate a thread to the original system. You can find it here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-simple-stupid Those that want to continue the original journey, please join me there. My intention is just to get it started and for others to evolve it in a way that stays true to the essence of the system.

Hi Mate. first of all. thank you for your contributions. this indicator works good some blocks are different from i find manually block. but not much deviation from me. for example at this chart i prefer this yellow highlighted bar. indi highlighted purple one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) our dash give me currency if there if order block levels i use this order block too. from now on i use this indi too. as i said repeadetly our dash give us currency after that we have to do PA. order blocks one of them. and order blocks very useful to trade.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hii mate he give us the last 3 bar Hours from the time it runs I put 1M 3 bar to test..

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Do you mean that it will display only one line of reading which is the Max-Min for the last 3 hours? So it will always override the reading with the latest Max-Min within the last 3 hours?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
i think it tires cpu a lot. so he limits bar count.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Actually originally I thought it just log down the Highest and Minimum at every 1 hour interval like your spreadsheet, e.g. 01:00, 02:00, 03:00, just take a snapshot of the highest and lowest reading, then it will not be cpu intensive.....

--- 帖子 #612 ---
i want to add one knowledge. timing is important looking time to dashboard. but i saw when london close signal is better. i quess why. it is because our indicator results comes from volatile times' result. i mean when you look london open actually you see asian session result. so london close give us better result but at that time not tradeble time. until today i looked daily close(newyork close) and use london open(next day) Note: this is about timing not about pa. if pa works another time i used it.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
by the way, Something came to mind, but I haven't figured out how to integrate it yet. if you have any idea you can tell me. our dashboard show us result currency by currency. you know what is main thing m1-m5-m15 same time. so can we use this as multiplier. example below. i dont know if i could tell you. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #614 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I have not had for very long......Still coming to grips with it. I suggest going to their web site do your home work and play with it.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
additionally if one money has -21 point that means all pairs of that money and all tf(m1-m5-m15) same sell signal same time. if one money has +21 point that means all pairs of that money and all tf(m1-m5-m15) same buy signal same time. this is perfect setup. this stiuation multiplier is 1 for exapmle. if one money has -15 point that means some pairs of that money and some tf(m1-m5-m15) same sell signal same time. if one money has +15 point that means some pairs of that money and some tf(m1-m5-m15) same buy signal same time. this is not perfect setup. this stiuation multiplier is 0.8 for exapmle. i havent found how to use and what contribute us. any idea is well done.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Less chances less lots. more odds + lots. I am following the evolution of the situation with interest. Perhaps one topic that has not yet been considered is money management. But maybe it's too early to talk about it.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Now I will draw something for you below, if you see a mistake in what I have drawn, I would appreciate it if you let me know. I will say something else based on your answer. Think our best signal is eurusd eur point +21 usd -21 point. so i bought eurusd at zero point. and after time i added more longs at 1-2-3 point. other eur pairs is right side they action like that. is that wrong to add position.

this how it work .. just exmple Now I just entered 3 fields to see how it works Later I will complete the remaining 24

--- 帖子 #620 ---
In a perfect world your reasoning would be perfect. These days I took a quick look at the dash and what I noticed is that for example the 2 values +21 and -21 remain for a very short time then the currencies are uncorrelated. The risk is to always enter the trades too late (perhaps because the TFs used are too fast). I trade using only PA (S/D S/R QM) but I can't imagine how you do an analysis starting from D1 to H1 and then trade M1. I understand when you go long you say I wait for a pullback and trade the PA but who tells you that it has not reached a maximum point for example supply in H1 or H4 and starts to go down. I do not know. When I do scalping I dedicate myself only and exclusively to that currency (normaly GJ and Gold) because I am so focused that I can not look at anything else. It is my opinion but your reasoning I would see it better on larger TFs where then trading the PA becomes a pleasure

--- 帖子 #621 ---
If you look at my charts they are not blank. There is support an resistences. My charts ready for all currency all indices all metals all oil types. I have spent 2 years for that. I have interesting type of techniques. All of them took my 5 years. I am not new trader. I am developer to find consistent method. Do You suppose that 1 indicator do all the job. There is no way like this. If there is a way i had done until now. As i said i work too much for forex. I will add interesting calculation. You will see. I planned next 5 steps.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I didn't say your charts are blank. I see you know how to track S / R and you know the PA very well. The market is not perfect which is why there are thousands of methods and indicators (I don’t use it). I am not as good as you at analyzing 28 pairs at the same time (also because I do not see the need since some pairs have for my account very high spreads and require a lot of margin). I have a reference TF (H4) which gives me the direction (I look only to HH HL LH LL). If I have a long bias and H4 go south I want to see in H1 LH and LL. Do I go short? NO because the bias is long. Many time I made poor entry but many time I have win the trade because I was in the right direction. When do I enter long? In support or demand with sniper entry or when (the most of time) H1 make a new HH. Unfortunately the zig zag is an indicator that is not able to adequately track HH HL LH LL but we must be satisfied with what it does. I will continue to follow you and if I have any ideas I will share them. Let's wish everyone good luck.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Ok my friend. Evertime we have %50 possibilty win or lose. So it not the case focusing more one chart or less focusin more chart. If focusing solve winning rate. Everyone would focus one pair. I am not offence you. This is point of view. I do not claim to have analyzed very well. I'm doing enough analysis for me. Sometimes it's not enough and I lose. This is in the nature of this work. If anyone says that I am winning at 100%, let them come and explain how.

What does this have to do with this topic? Get yourself another topic on the forum and flood there.

Good Luck you all.

Who are you to make such announcements here? Have you ever made a helpful post here? Go back to where you came from, you will not become a successful trader. I notice that already by the questions you ask without thinking about it first. Coming here in 2021, does it have to do with Corona? Try again with what you did before and leave alone the people here who are doing an excellent job. If you have something to say, maybe try using more polite language! P.Action Don't let people like that influence you, just overlook them and move on. We need each other!

Thank you for defending me. It's really hard to share something here. I'm pretty sure it's not just me. but it affects a lot. when you look at last week. I first explained the algorithm of the dash indicator. Someone said keep it simple there is an indicator available. The indicator was made, I traded with it, I earned money, I shared it. They said no graphics. I shared charts and they didn't even comment on my charts. now the above event. I really don't understand why people are so vindictive and intolerant. the guy above can't stand 1 message. Anyway, I made money from the things I did. I took my money. I continue now. So I'm happy. I wish for everyone

Thanks for accepting my idea walidchidmi. This makes it very easy for us to choose the best trades When many people do not agree with my opinion. I respect you for accepting my point Most traders are interested in showing the trading results in the practice accounts but they are not really profitable in the live trading accounts.

Hello friends Can you set an alert when the arrow appears thanks

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I need an help on how to recall the alter from an expert, is there a coder that can show an example on how to make this?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I think 2 timeframes is enough for this zigzag thingy tbh. If 1H is long, just wait for 5min long signal and go for it (or any other 2 tf's of your liking combined). Just my 2 cents...

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I just tried it with 1min and 15min... fairly easy if you like staring at your screen all day long. Not my kindda thing but it made more sense then 3 tf's. Anyway here's the pic of that try Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #561 ---
To start with make sure you have followed the thread properly to be sure you have the latest updates. Setup on each currency pairs chart you want to trade &amp; get alerts for those selected pairs.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
This thread should back to main idea which " ZigZag " you are only talking about Supply and Demand and this is the problem i tried many times to read all replays on the thread all we need here are Crow and Smasha and Walid. i tried many times to get an idea from P.Action replays and i got nothing he just has his own analysis for tradinghe draw his levels and we just watch how he succeed on every order and how the price following his Supply and Demand levels But what about ZigZag system?!! Stop sharing anything else here except the original idea and just working on it in every chart or every replay if someone uses another trading system or style please open your own thread and i will be the first follower please don't distroy this thread i made 40% in 2 days by the Original system from Crow and Smasha and Walid only. please keep the guys working on the Original idea if you have good view on charts and your own successful trading style open your own thread or open Telegram channel and sell VIP Signals. Period.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
hii Woodyz Please can you share this version of the indicator ?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I think one of the things is that the indicator can give false signals and so other traders are trying to find a way to filter this. Crow does say that it depends on your strategy. In this post https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post13977952 you can see that he is using a Bulls and Bears type indicator too as part of his strategy. Imagine someone comes up with a great solution but doesn't post it here?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
There's thousands of threads here most of it gives false signals even the most popular threads you will never get something in trading gives you only winning signals we shouldn't go to every thread and share our personal ideas we should only participate here with the original idea ONLY as i said to you i made great profits from just the original idea with just some edits but i still feel there's something missing to get the perfect result i appriciate to walidchidmi for his effort here i'm trying to get the full view to share my tips to get better or the best scalping trading system but it's not F#kin funny to view this thread everyday and watch more than 100 replays just for Supply and demand or someone share his own analysis and philosophize on us on every replay,,,,.. JUST KEEP THIS THREAD FOR ZZ SYSTEM AND IDEAS AND GO OUT.

Hi Derekw, is there a way to have the zigzag_startlevel_v2 update itself as the v1? see charts here, where you can see that on the left side the v1 updated itself properly, v2 has a delay of some kind: Thanks &amp; green pips to all here Attached Image (click to enlarge) ok found it out: the input parameter values made the "delay":

--- 帖子 #680 ---
there are alert ..

--- 帖子 #681 ---
yes, alerts, but push notification could be send to smartphone thanks

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Quite right.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hello P action I have been trying to download zigzag alert indicator to my chart but all in vain, help me with one that will perfectly for me thanks

--- 帖子 #684 ---
The key is here Attached Image (click to enlarge) and this Dashboard only all updates from walid didn't work fine like this one but we should get some filters to avoid overbought and oversold pairs. i need Walid make this dashboard more bold and wide and please it makes my platform freeze many times

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Just use walidchidmi's dashboard https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14005349 https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14007299 with any following trend scalping system and u will see M A G I C don't make this thread more complex like the others who opened threads they change their indicator sets per trade SO when you get an alert here just put this pair on the chart and analyse it with any scalping system you use and get best entry point and get money Attached Image (click to enlarge) that's it.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
All clear. But where is the indi that you show

--- 帖子 #687 ---
just open the links and download what walidchidmi shared only read his posts here

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Can you add the suffix option for this indi too?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Thank you for your answer. One last question when the indicator changes currency push an alert notification?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
no it doesn't but the dashboard give you alerts for strongest and weakest currencies on the Dashboard there's just 1 strong currency and 1 weak when any of it get +21 points of -21 points Like CAD in this Screenshot has +21 points Attached Image (click to enlarge) and the weakest 1 here is GBP -19 points but this dashboard give you an alert when it reachs 21 points so the another indicator in next screen Attached Image (click to enlarge) it shows you earlier prediction for the next strong or weak so before we get positive or negative 21 points you get earlier perdection then use your favorite scalping system to get the best entry point whatever you use technical indicators or clean charts i'm not choosing 1 pair i analyse 2 or 3 weakest currencies against the strongest 1 to get more trades my opinion for all of this this amazing work from walid help me to use my strategy better and help me to choose best pair to trade not every signal of my own strategy it filtered my signals far better

--- 帖子 #691 ---
and simply let's share my result as simple as 1 2 3 1- just using dashboard with very classic scalping strategy following trend Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2-when someone shared fake results written by keyboard i tried to test that stupid indicator and lost in 1 hour 25% of my balance and when i mentioned that they said it's silly and change indicator set and when i asked him to edit the 1st post he did it but didn't edit with new set!! he edited his 1st post to just say DO NOT TRADE THIS SYSTEM BLINDLY... DISCRETION IS NEEDED! i think after many stupid edits on his thread with an unnecessary philosophy he should edit the title of the thread to "keep it stupid" and remove word "simple" Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3-then here i back to the dashboard with the classic analysis following 30m and 1H trend to recover all loses from the stupid indicator Attached Image (click to enlarge) SO.... in my opinion the guy who did great work in this thread and we should follow him is Walidchidmi ONLY the other guy who call himself Price action opened his own thread to promote for his stupid supply and demand indicator and guess what he lost all of his balance shorting AUDJPY while the great dashboard indicator gave an alert to Long AUDJPY this is the point The only guy we should support and follow is Walidchidmi

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Something like this...

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Awesome can you share this system with me please?

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Nothing fancy, just checking where is the price at that moment according to the strongest/weakest curency, like you suggest, lines are EMA 36- median price, Ema 200, attached indicator with default settings....Also found a nice approach from another user(can be attached in subwindow ------ https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post13999775 )

--- 帖子 #695 ---
i'm not searching for something fance, i use the dashboard as a filter. actually it's the best filter ever to use with just good scalping system to take and run i'm user at this forum since 2013 and i don't talk much i just keep watching but this time there's something great happen here. so we should share ideas around this dashboard "filter" and safest better ways to trade with it. the problem happened when 2 guys opened threads to share their own stupid indicators. we should all work together on developing a system with this filter make trading better , safe and easy without drawing million lines on the chart but it depends on how we gonna help each other.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Can you please share with us, How you analyse this with single chart example? Thank you for your input

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I don't Know how develop and to use it. At the moment my is just curiosity. But please keep it simple. Don't need trading system with many indicators. Learn at first how the price moves on S/R and S/D. A stupid example take some minute ago GJ buy Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Sorry! I was confused. Can anyone describe exactly what indicators and settings I need to set? I want walidchidmi's system to work as it should! With alerts. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
at this moment 07:19am GMT the weakest currencies are EUR and JPY and strongest one is NZD so our pairs so analyse are EURNZD / NZDJPY we should short EURNZD and long NZDJPY just draw trend line or use fibonacci RSI to confirm and stochastic to buy from oversold point (on m1 to m5 chart) and basic look at higher frame to watch if you following trend or not that's very simple and basic to get better entry point and get some pips and exit i don't have enough time now to share screens but i will do it later

Are you able to share how the green and magenta lines are calculated? It is like somewhere in the middle of the 2 zig zags, but in the same time it seems random and no better than any other price line between the zig zags.. Or anybody can try?

Here is an idea for entries and exits. Sell above the grey channel in the sell zone on Zig Zag 3TF signal. The closer to the outside the better. Set TP in the grey/green part of the center channel Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here are the goods: Attached File(s) Zig Zag ATR NRP.zip 48 KB | 586 downloads

I agreed with the entry and stop loss part but for the take profit part, seems like not feasible. When the M15 trend changes, mean the original trade that we entered in M1 has already turn negative, so how can there be any profit to take?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
The zigzag startlevel indicator in the 1st post is good but now we got the mq4 file that comes with the fibo levels, maybe this system can be improve further on the part for placing Stop loss and take profit levels.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hello everyone and thanks for this thread. I suscribe. It is good to line up different TFs and confirm with a 1-2-3 break. I make a suggestion, and it is possible to modify the multichart indicator that shows the ZIGZAG signals. Thank you all! This indicator is from MLaden and attached for your use.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Hi guys, Can we make this indicator with MTF and button off/on options?

Another buy signal this morning (GJ M5)

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Brilliant! Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hey man Can you make it Multi TF?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
The idea cold be with a different ID put the same indi in the same chart 1 for example M5 1 M15 and trade the direction of the main trend

--- 帖子 #738 ---
A SCALPING APPROACH ENTRY POINTS (M15 chart, any pair) BUY - When up arrow appears on current bar. SELL - When down arrow appears on current bar. STOP LOSS BUY - Stop loss @ up arrow price (usually 5 - 10 pips). SELL - Stop loss @ down arrow price (usually 5 - 10 pips). TAKE PROFIT BUY - 5 - 10 pips or trailing stop. SELL - 5 - 10 pips or trailing stop. Attached Image (click to enlarge) SELL EXAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE (NOTE WHERE STOP IS SET, APPLY SAME APPROACH FOR BUY) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Good Luck! That's all from me.

Dear all I would like to code a new dashoard - similar to the dashoard of Waldi here in this thread. Do someone have the source code of the zig_zag_startlevel indicator? Fore sure, I will provide the dashoard here in this thread too Thank you Best hundsbua

--- 帖子 #597 ---
It is a "normal" ZZ nothing special. You can find others ZZ with buffers for an EA or dash board. Look at Forex station.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
