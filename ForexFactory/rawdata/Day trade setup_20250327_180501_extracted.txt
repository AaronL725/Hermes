Take a screenshot and share your trading thoughts It will improve your trading a lot.
here is a little software for screenshots
https://app.prntscr.com/en/

This is the system I developed and share on the internet in 2013.
Many websites have published this system as it and they have added their thought.

System concept:
1. Trading the Trend
2. Focus on the short-term so the stop remains manageable.
3. Improve win rate with the help of MTF.
4. Not opening buy at too much high.
5. Not opening sales at too much low.
6. Stop trying to catch a Falling knife like other newbies wanted to do.
7. Moving average stop working in a sideway market so trying to have a clear understanding when there is a sideways market.

The 2013 system is already a good one, Trade with it. you will see good results with proper practice.

2023 Update
1. it is very much the same as the 2013 system.
2. Tried to clarify the entry point more precisely.
3. Add a histogram indicator.
4. Added daily, weekly, and Monthly open lines.
5. Added Market structure PDF for a better understanding of the market. ( shared it here )
6. Started using 6 and 21 GMMA with RSI filtered. ( Already I share this in my profile) so that I can turn off MA when I want.
7. Started trading one pair GJ only.

2023 version of the system, I have already shared a few tools here and there.
I will not share it publicly since it is the same as the 2013 version.

Trade this system with full confidence and test it yourself in the market you will gain confidence.
when I discuss Guppy's Multi-Moving Average (GMMA) don't get confused I have been inspired by Guppy but GMMA and My system have some differences if you test it you will understand. I use 6 to 21 ema one ma sets instead of 2 MA sets. Because I like to trade swings.

How to Be a Better Trader
Analyzing and reviewing your trades is essential for improving your forex trading performance. Here are ten trade review rules to help you evaluate your trades effectively:Review your trade setup: Assess the quality of your trade setup based on your trading strategy's criteria. Determine if the trade met your entry rules and if there were any additional factors that influenced your decision. Analyze the market context: Consider the overall market conditions at the time of the trade. Review the prevailing trend, support and resistance levels, economic news releases, or any other relevant factors that may have impacted the trade's outcome. Evaluate risk management: Assess your risk management practices, including your position sizing, stop-loss placement, and take-profit levels. Determine if your risk-to-reward ratio was appropriate and if you followed your risk management rules. Examine trade execution: Analyze how well you executed the trade. Assess whether you entered and exited the trade according to your plan or if there were any execution errors or delays that may have affected the outcome. Review trade duration: Consider the duration of the trade and whether it aligned with your initial expectations. Determine if you exited too early or held on for too long, based on your analysis and strategy. Monitor emotions: Reflect on your emotional state during the trade. Assess whether emotions, such as fear, greed, or impatience, influenced your decision-making process. Identify any patterns or areas for improvement in managing your emotions. Analyze trade outcomes: Evaluate the outcome of the trade, whether it resulted in a profit or a loss. Determine if the outcome was aligned with your expectations and if there were any unexpected price movements or market events that affected the trade. Keep a trading journal: Maintain a detailed trading journal to record all relevant trade information, including entry and exit points, reasoning behind the trade, and your emotional state. This journal will help you track patterns, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make data-driven improvements. Identify patterns and trends: Look for recurring patterns, trends, or common mistakes in your trades. This analysis can help you identify areas for improvement, such as consistently missing entry signals, exiting trades prematurely, or failing to follow your trading plan. Adjust your trading plan: Based on your trade review, make necessary adjustments to your trading plan, risk management strategies, or trading rules. Continuously refine and adapt your approach based on your trade analysis to enhance your future trading performance. Trade review should be an ongoing process to continually learn and grow as a trader. By implementing these trade review rules, you can gain valuable insights into your trading decisions and improve your overall trading effectiveness.

10EMA Example Trade Setup - 2024

GBP/JPY4-hour Chart: Price is above the 10 EMA (uptrend). 1-hour Chart: Price retraces to the 10 EMA and forms a bullish engulfing pattern. Entry: Enter a long position at the close of the bullish engulfing candle. Stop Loss: Place it below the recent swing low on the 1-hour chart. Take Profit: Set a take profit at 1.5 to 2 times the risk or trail the stop loss below the 10 EMA on the 1-hour chart. Oil4-hour Chart: Price is below the 10 EMA (downtrend). 1-hour Chart: Price retraces to the 10 EMA and forms a bearish engulfing pattern. Entry: Enter a short position at the close of the bearish engulfing candle. Stop Loss: Place it above the recent swing high on the 1-hour chart. Take Profit: Set a take profit at 1.5 to 2 times the risk or trail the stop loss above the 10 EMA on the 1-hour chart. By following this strategy, traders can align their trades with the prevailing market trend, optimize their entries and exits, and manage risk effectively.

To become successful we don't have to trade every single swing of the market. we have to trade the few swings in the market.

Sometimes we will be right and sometime we will be wrong. It's okay to be incorrect.

I have developed this system in 2013, Now 2023 I have redesigned it here. Concepts are almost the same. Trade the trend. This system is still making money.

when your up so many pips you will happy to lose few trade-in Counter trend or counter the momentum of the market it is easy to do when your in large profit

--- 帖子 #36 ---
The logic behind the trade was simple,

1. H4 3 bar reversal.

2. Market was in a slow range.  M15 first set of trade targets was a Daily pivot.

3. Second set of trade was impulse trade with the break out of pivot and RN. with M15 ema directions.

Impulsive entry is like a break-out entry. you will not wait to close the candle you will enter a trade with stop and target.

Sorry if you think that was a silly question sir. I wanna ask one last question? Can we use the strategy on LTF like M5 to M30 and what pairs do you recommend? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Homamiadana I can understand your concern, If you follow this thread's last 2 pages you will see I trade GJ, and most of the time Ltf like M15 and M5 also.

If your asking simple questions like this it means you are not trained enough to trade this ema trading system. I use HTF and Ltf. I trade with the directions of the trend. with proper stop and TP. I use RN and Daily pivot line only too. I use daily open lines too.

To become good at this you have to practice. My trading, most of them are my intuitions and my market understanding. you have to develop it with lots of chart reading.

Hope you understand. I don't use Ha or Pivot or RSI or TDI any of those. Not weekly pivot too. I flow with the market.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
All are intuitions and risk management.

I stop using FF calendar too.

Nothing Just chart and Chart only.

22 Day trading most of the day I am with profit. Sometimes big profit sometimes small.

Trust me I am not an expert, I just follow market momentum and trend to make some pips here in there.

Remember I am always aware of basic charting like S&R and so on and so forth, Nothing is sure. The worse thing you can do is you pic top, and sell and the market go up and up and up. so Trade one pair you will develop your required skills.

I have traded GU for a few years, I have traded Gold for a few years, I have traded US30 too. Now I trade GJ only. Every market has its own personality. Day trading is hard so trading one pair it will help you manage your risk and it will help you understand many things. Sometimes I don't understand what is going on but I come out right because of intuitions.

Best of luck.

I think lucky41 asks about the indi's and template for MT5, as you have provided the files for MT4.

I rebuilt from the instructions the basic template, but the other added indi's I haven't yet looked for MT5 replacements (It's late at night - AKA can't be bothered at the moment)

Your template (attached in post 1) gave a weird blank screen with the price at the bottom.

why 30 ema

--- 帖子 #62 ---
In this situation, you can do anything, especially if your trend trader has a small stop loss. you have to stop trading when a few trades stop out.

once market start moving with certain directions you can trade again and make some easy money.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
The market is smart, Just trading the trend is not good enough. After a trend, there is always a slow period when trend traders will lose their profit. That is why we have to specifically identify when we will not risk your money.

Trading ma is good especially when the market is moving, When the market is slow, we have to have written rules on how we wait and how we adjust ourselves to market change.

Indicators are tools we have to apply in the right place.

If we look at GJ this week we see after a 2-day trend last 3-day market is sideway and slow.

How to Trend Trade with Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA)

This is Babypips link. Read it if you are new to GMMA.
Our GMMA indicator is a little improved version. we also have RSI if RSI above 55 EMA sows Green.
If RSI is Below 45 GMMA shows READ EMA.
So it is a perfect tool for trend trading.

Interesting is that you can identify a Slow sideway market with GMMA too.
Practice practice and practice. Trading one pair with low leverage. you will get there quickly.
One GMMA indicator is the Button indicator any time we can off it and scan the market structure and PA too.

Best of luck

Questions: GMMA has 2 sets of MA one is short-term ma sats another is long-term sats of ma, why do I use one set of MA instead of 2 sets of ma?

Answer: GMMA has 2 sets of MA short-term and long-term. I use one set of ma because I love to trade the swing of the market. The fx market doesn't always have a big trend like the stock market.

Questions: some people use 3 or 4 sets of ma.

Answer: yes, I have seen their chart, I think it's foolishness to use 3 or 4 sets of MA. By changing TF we can easily see multiple levels of trend directions.

I focus on swing trading. rather than opening one trade and holding it for a long time.

Question: why do you use 6 and 21 ma sets? why not 10 and 34, 20 and 50 ema?

Answer: I found 6 and 21 EMA interesting my early trading test, I still use them if you think other sets of EMA are good for you you can use them. I can use a small stop that is why I use them.

Question: why MA, don't you know MA is a lagging indicator?

Answer: MA is a lagging indicator I know it. I am not as smart as you please go to other methods because they have the magic to predict the market tops and bottoms. I believe this method is profitable and I make it profitable for me. If you practice you will make this method profitable for you. observe the chart and trade. It is not EA that will make money for you automatically. Your judgment is required to trade this method.

I think some people are not getting the strategy right.

I said with this system you can identify the Sideway market.

MA trading strategy does not generate profit in a sideways market.

Questions is how do you know it is sideway market or not. observations and practice come to play here.

here is an example, when too many candles are on Both side of the ma. It is clear that it is sideways. wait to break the sideways zone.

Another indicator will not make you profitable but your understanding of when to trade and when not to trade makes you a good trader.

Best of luck

Now trading with this system in these conditions will be a wrong decision.

Hope it helps.

I have received a few private messages.

Thanks for all the good words.

I am happy that you liked this system, keep practicing it will generate a profit I firmly believe it.

Trade one pair, if possible trade good tranding pair like GJ, EJ, UJ.

Don't trade choppy pairs like UC, EG etc.

we trade one pair there are some reasons for that. we trade tranding pairs their reason for that.

I hope you understand.

Let me explain so you will understand it clearly.

when Daily HA is green, H4 HA is green, H1 HA is read look for the first green Ha candle in H1 chart and Buy and stop gose below h1 Green HA candle.

Remember Setup must be compline with the Day trade setup system. Here is an example. Nice and sweet.

Here is an excellent entry I missed.

The day trade setup is not only a system it is a Framework to trade trends. Have a framework. yes, there will be time when the Trend trading framework will not work out like GJ now. when the Trend trading framework doesn't work you can look for other markets to trade the trend or just draw 2 zone and buy and sell from zone to zone with a stop loss.

Can you elaborate why and how do you take this trade?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Yes, you are right, today in fact last few days we had nothing to trade in GJ.

Here is an example of good trade in Gold. although we don't usually trade gold, this is for educational purposes.

The price is below the weekly open line.

Price was above the daily open line after Breaking the high of the day price come back below the daily open line( SMC traders call it a liquidity grab), our EMA shows since the sell side flow.

price break the low of the day. As a trend trade, we could open sell after breaking the low.

See the picture you will understand better

I opened 3 trades in Us30 last day. one I took 1 to 1 RR profit, another I took 1 to 2 RR a little more profit. and the final one hit stop. so I generate some profit from us30 yesterday's trade.

It is ok to lose a trade because as long as we are losing systematically.

Best of luck

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Actually, it was an intuition, but it was not a good trade. Just share I make mistakes too.

some of the mistakes will give you profit some of the good trades also make you lose. we are not perfect.

all we have to do is manage risk

From the pdf book

LIQUIDITY

The FOREX market is a zero sum game, which means that for a trader/institution to buy/sell 1 currency pair it's necessary that there is another trader/institution with an opposite position. If Smart Money (Banks) want to buy a currency pair they will need sellers in the market, the existing facility to place these positions In the market is called LIQUIDITY. The Liquidity is defined by Stop losses, where the Stop losses exist is where the liquidity also exists, Smart Money need to activate the stop losses of existing orders in the market so that they can place their positions in the market. The banks manipulate the price because of liquidity, but why? banks negotiate large trading volumes and sometimes find it difficult to find the other side of their trades, so they manipulate the price so that they can have their positions in the market.

LIQUIDITY TYPES

Buy Stops Liquidity (BSL)

Sell Stops Liquidity (SSL)

Buy Stops Liquidity (BSL)

The BSL is originated by Stop Losses of sell orders, after the BSL is taken, the market reverses to the downside, because banks use the BSL to place sell orders in the market.

What to focus on (for BSL)

PMH - Previous Month High

PWH - Previous Week High

PDH - Previous Day High

HOD - High Of Day

OLD HIGH - Swing High

EQUAL HIGHS = Retail Resistance

Sell Stops Liquidity (SSL)

The SSL is originated by Stop Losses of Buy orders, after the SSL is taken, the market reverses to the Upside, because banks use the SSL to place Buy orders in the market

What to focus on (for SSL)

PML - Previous Month Low

PWL - Previous Week Low

PDL - Previous Day Low

LOD - Low Of Day

OLD LOW - Swing Low

EQUAL LOWS = Retail Support

These are just a few concepts. Trade with a Day trade setups framework. you will generate a much better return.

Best of luck

Thank you bro! I really like your template.

Next one was a M1 entry. Can see price is respecting the wave multiple times and even when goes above, rejects down very fast.

I entered with a very tight SL, with the aim of putting the trade to B/E very fast. As soon as the wave protects my SL I put it to B.E. Let's see.

I want to make sure it's bullish or bearish on both D1 and H1 chart.

Then when M5 has a setup, I'll enter the market.

So I'm not ready to short yet, despite M5 saying so

Trading US30 on NFP is playing with fire bro! Ha! Glad to hear you made money on Gold. I took an early position then closed before NFP but would have won but I hate trading news so just closed it.

I was just posting to ask if I can post Gold trades here using your system or is this thread only for GJ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #191 ---
yes, I was looking for a sharp move in us30 but It chop a lot today.

In my early us30 trading experience tell me, sometimes trading us30 is very easy and sometimes trading it is very very difficult. today was a difficult day.

If anyone trades us30 he will face trading fx difficulties because of the volatility. It is much safer to trade fx than the index, in My opinion. when the market is slow we could use range trading in the fx pair but us30 range trading is also difficult anyway, I have to back off from us30, it is in a bear market anyway.

I have taken a few small positions in gold. make good pips

Best of luck.

I don't trade the indices so can't give my opinion but trust yours.

Maybe charts + explanation for trade would be nice as well!

--- 帖子 #197 ---
On request, here's my thought process when I took this trade.

Pt #1, HTF on D1. Based on Wed & Thur candlestick closing bullish and MA Gold-cross, my bias is only to take LONG entry.

Pt #2, entry on M15. After the formation of 3 consecutive bullish candles and MA Gold-cross, I decide to take the leap of faith to take LONG position.

My SL is at previous Swing Low.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Nice one! D1 bias looks good and H4 + H1 looked VERY bullish. Only slight thing I would say is LN open often goes for liquidity before continuing the move so just something to keep in mind. So in this scenario we could have had a spike down before the rise. In this particular case you were right but just something I've seen a lot that might help you!

--- 帖子 #199 ---

The pound-yen pair ended with a sharp rise in the employment statistics, but it is likely to enter a crossing range in the future, and it will be difficult to see a sense of direction or a trend. However, since the low price is completely blocked by the daily chart, it is easy to raise if it is lowered.

Excellent trade, You are a very good example for new traders who whats to trade with this system.

The problem is some people can't believe they can become a profitable trader with this simple system.
Some people look for algo validations system. I know some people who use proper Bactested profitable system yet they fail to generate profit.
Trading is the art of managing risk and believing in themself. Very few people understand it.

"If you're good at something, you'll tell everyone. If you're great at something, they'll tell you."

"When you know you're right, you don't need to worry about what the markets will do in the short term."
"To be a successful trader, you have to be able to admit mistakes. People who are very rigid and unwilling to change their minds, they'll never make it."
"Investing is a strange business. It's the only one we know of where the more expensive something gets, the more people want to buy it."

Nail on the head there mate. VERY well said

With scalping I really try and enter the market with momentum such that price doesn't wick close to my entry point more than once. I get a lot of breakevens but also very few losses but the absolute key is to manage risk as you said. I can't control if I will win/lose but can control the risk on a position so try and do that to the max. I don't go for big R therefore winrate is important to me. B/E trades are just free trades and overall improve my winrate. Your template gives me a very good entry point. Just see what timeframe price is respecting the wave.

And yes trading is all about finding what works for you. It's funny but the way people read the market is almost a reflection of the trader's mind. You will find successful traders in Elliot Wave, Gann Analysis, Astrology Trading, Harmonics etc etc. Each using COMPLETELY different theory and yet ALL making money. How? All they did is master one theory and use that as a reference for the market. The market just does what it does. You just need some basic theory to give you a point of reference and after that nothing but chart time will get you to your goals. Above all be fluid. I tend to look for failures as well as patterns completing. Both tell me something. My favourite pattern is just the engulf inline with structure as you can tell. If structure is up and there is a big engulf down then I ask why? Doesn't make sense. Then usually there is another engulf in the direction of structure and that's the one to take.

It's like asking asking a Jazz pianist to show you how he/she improvises to Jazz. This isn't something you can teach to the novice. You can just teach the novice the basics and then the novice MUST put in the work to gain a deep understanding of music. Develop a subconscious understanding. It's something that takes years of dedication & work to develop. Develop your own view of the market as if you look to copy others you won't know what to do when you need to adapt and evolve to ever changing market conditions. Take what helps you from others but always have your own view. This is why there is no holy grail as it's different for every individual based on their psychology.

Confidence comes from success and success just comes from learning from your failures. We mostly berate ourselves when we fail but that is a defeatist attitude of a fixed mindset. We MUST extract the lessons from the losses and use that as an evolutionary process to get better not let huge emotional rollercoasters affect us. If you miss an easy trade, instead of getting angry or upset, just ask yourself WHY? What can I do better next time? If you take a stupid trade then again ask WHY? What was I thinking at the time of taking the trade? How can I learn from that? A really good way of doing it to have a microphone attached to your PC and record yourself taking a trade, speaking out loud your entire thought process for taking it. After a few days watch the video and you will be surprised. I used to to do this when I started.

Above all this game just takes time and faith. You must walk by faith and not sight when you start any endeavour to become the exception to the odds in any field.

This approach is nice and simple but must be married to your own observations and experience. The trick is not to complicate an already complex task but to simplify it as much as possible.

Some Veteran Trader Wrote this, I can't remember where I read it:

"I separate the notion of reality from beliefs. However, beliefs are those things that I choose to rely on. I have consciously changed my beliefs in my life. My reality, on the other hand, is that part that is neurologically wired in me. I know this may sound like semantics, but it isn't. In my e-mail (this is part of his instruction to a group of his trading students), I specifically tried to highlight the fact that I was "choosing" these beliefs (more about this in a minute). For example, I choose to use a particular trading methodology. But that belief is not neurologically grounded in me. It is simply a framework in which I choose to view market structure. I readily admit that the "market" has no knowledge of the existence of that structure.

In my trading work, I have done many exercises of simply removing all indicators from my charts to purposely change my perception. I also studied Elliott Wave for a year which is also a structure in which to view the market, yet very different from DG. I made a choice of which structure I wanted to apply to the market. I didn't choose a structure that I thought actually was the market. This is very important to my mindset and approach to the market. I am under the perception that all successful traders have adopted some sort of belief system about the markets. I also think that these traders would readily admit that their beliefs may not necessarily be shared by others. Yet, it doesn't matter. It is what they "choose" to adopt."

As a means of self management, I do the following after a trade. I score myself as follows

Trade Entry              x/10

Trade Management   X/10

Emotional State        x/10

Total                        x/ 30

You have to be honest with yourself.

Nice entry! Just as the wick was forming.

I had a short but needed a pullback to enter and then it went to my TP without a pullback so I removed the limit. Then when I saw it turn long, I was looking for an entry long but it was a little too fast for me today.

We should make it to H4 supply today I think.

GJ is in a range we see in H4 and H1 and the Daily chart. so it is better to adopt a range trading strategies like supply and demand.

price hit H4 and H1 supply zone. I sold right at the top at 10 pips stop loss.

but your trade at m5 is good one. especially when the price close below monthly open line we could easily sell

XAUUSD

This one was sssoo obvious. I had a breakeven on this earlier but just saw this engulf at the wave after. Once it made a new high I put to B/E.

The main thing about this is structure, trend, momentum EVERYTHING is UP massively. On ALL timeframes. Only looking for longs.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
XAUUSD

This one will most likely go out at breakeven and can see it was aggressive as didn't reject the wave with an engulf but the key thing in all this for me is risk management. A free trade is very valuable.

This was my last trade of the day.

GU, can see it was VERY unlucky. Often at the end of the day Friday price just drips up steadily with no pullbacks so these kinds of trades work really well on Fridays. In this case can see I was very unlucky. I trade with VERY tight stops therefore can't withstand a big pullback which is why I put it to breakeven the minute price shifts from my zone of entry. I do get a lot of breakeven trades but I maintain a high winrate which is my priority as it prevents periods of big drawdowns. Instead I get big periods of just breakevens. If the pullback that took me out was a big one then I can look for another entry when it is finished but over here can see it was just VERY unlucky as it came right to my SL then went. Obviously the biggest market in the world didn't come for my SL but was just unlucky.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Doesn't matter Bro. our strategy is very good we will get lots of opportunities.

100 to 200 pips consistently in a month will make us successful traders.

The day I lowered my expectation I started to feel good about my trading.

It is about being happy with the things we have

I did not trade the last Friday because I had already made lots of pips last week.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hello Hasib, this made me very happy... I was reading your system years back. Lol, I also posted my system there years back. Maybe 2013 or 2014. It was "Extreme TMA system" or something like that. Lovely times. I know here on FF is also the TMA system, but I was first I believe. It was kinda fun someone had same idea as me.

Sadly I later found that people stole my system and was charging like 250 US Dollars for it. That really pissed me of back then. 😆

Nice to see you here.

How to use Multiple Time frames for your trade.

At the beginning of the month always try to predict what could happen this month. see the last few months how price is moving.

Is the price moving with the range of the last few months or price is moving towards some direction up or down?

Is the price too much away from 21 ema?

Last month's price range is big or small?

Try to understand a few basics. Remember my concept. if the price is above this month's open line we will think the price will go up.

If the price is lower than this month's open line we will think the price will move lower. The monthly open line is our equilibrium for this month.

In a sideway market, the price will touch too much monthly open line in either direction. Stay careful in that month. Preserve your capital for the trending month we know we can make lots of pips in the trending market.

Also, we could see the Roun number for market conditions understanding.

I know we can't predict the movement of this month with 100% accuracy but with practice, we will improve our observation power.

Hello SilentFather

Hope you are doing well, Nice to see you here. I strongly believe, only a small group of determined individuals will overcome the obstacles and gain the necessary skills and discipline to succeed in trading. Copying other people's systems and selling to others will make scammers. I have kept everything free so that people who want to learn can learn it for free. I have seen in the Discord group some of the traders are making good pips, I feel like they are doing much better. I hope they will do much better than me also. It makes me happy.

BTW Extreme TMA System is created by Alorente in The FF as far as I know.

You can contribute your thoughts and ideas here too.

Best of luck

--- 帖子 #278 ---
You are correct! Alorente made it. I was however first with the idea maybe. I'm not really sure. Possible is we made it together. I will check  the date Alorente posted it. I checked my old email and I was registered on the site in 2012. Anyway funny thing is both of us making the same thing, haha! Maybe I should post it, too.

I would give you thoughts if I have any. Some systems does not need my ideas. Because they are mostly the same. Your system seems good enough already. At least from pictures I saw so far. I check few pages.

Definitely good system with proper explanation. For me, this is harder as I don't have much rules to follow "step by step". 😆

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Look at this book chart, it will improve your observation power.

I have marked 2 signals they did not open trade both will be losing trade. Anyway, we don't have to win every single trade nor do we have to trade every signal we get from the market. Just educational purposes you can observe the chart and improve our observation power.

I think traders should create videos about their trading thought. It gives them clarity.

If not for large people, it should be for a small group of people. It gives clarity and it enforce traders to observe the chart with more focus.

I have created a small video. I don't know how it happen but I tried. I know by doing this kind of video I will be better at making videos as well as be good at trading idea generations. focusing on a few markets gives more clarity too.

You make a video about your thought I will watch that video.

Trading is a lonely business that needs some people to encourage to keep going.

Best of luck everyone.

Here's a Example of detailed trading plan for a 6 and 21 EMA strategy:Trading Goals:Define your trading goals and the time horizon you want to trade within. For example, your goal could be to achieve a 20% return on your investment over the next 12 months.  Risk Tolerance:Determine your maximum risk tolerance for each trade. For instance, you may decide not to risk more than 1% of your trading account on any given trade.  Strategy:Your strategy is to use the 6 and 21 exponential moving averages (EMA) as indicators to identify the trend direction and entry and exit points. When the 6 EMA crosses above the 21 EMA, this is a bullish signal and indicates a potential long position. When the 6 EMA crosses below the 21 EMA, this is a bearish signal and indicates a potential short position.  Currency Pair Selection:Select currency pairs that have a high level of liquidity and volatility, as these are more suitable for the 6 and 21 EMA strategy. For instance, popular pairs such as GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY may be good options.  Entry and Exit Points:Identify entry points by waiting for the 6 EMA to cross over the 21 EMA. This should be confirmed by other technical indicators, such as support and resistance levels, candlestick patterns, or other chart patterns. For exits, you could use a trailing stop-loss order, which moves up as the price of the currency pair increases. Alternatively, you could use a fixed take-profit level, which is a pre-determined price target that you set before entering the trade.  Risk Management:Use appropriate risk management techniques to minimize losses and protect your trading capital. This could include setting a stop-loss order at a predetermined level below the entry price, or using position sizing to limit the amount of capital risked on each trade.  Trading Schedule:Plan your trading sessions based on the currency pair's trading hours and the time zone you're in. You may want to consider trading during the most active periods when the markets are most liquid.  Record Keeping:Keep a record of your trades, including the entry and exit points, profit and loss, and any other relevant information. This helps you track your progress, evaluate your trading plan, and make improvements as necessary.  Review and Revise:Regularly review and revise your trading plan to ensure it remains effective and relevant. Take into account changes in market conditions, your own risk tolerance, and your trading goals  Best wishes 😀

Although indicators can be useful tools in forex trading, they are not without their problems. Here are some common problems associated with using indicators:Lagging: Most indicators are based on past price action and therefore are lagging in nature. This means that by the time a signal is generated, the price may have already moved significantly in the anticipated direction, resulting in missed opportunities or false signals. Overreliance: Traders may become over-reliant on indicators and use them in isolation, without taking into account other factors such as fundamental analysis or market sentiment. This can lead to erroneous trading decisions and missed opportunities. False signals: Indicators can generate false signals, especially in choppy or ranging markets where price action is erratic. These false signals can lead to losses and frustration for traders. Lack of customization: Most indicators have fixed parameters, such as the number of periods or the smoothing factor. These fixed parameters may not be suitable for all market conditions or trading styles, and traders may need to customize the indicators to suit their needs. Overcomplication: Indicators can make trading overly complicated, especially for novice traders who may struggle to understand how they work or how to interpret the signals generated. This can lead to confusion and poor decision-making. In summary, while indicators can be useful tools in forex trading, they should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and traders should be aware of their limitations and potential drawbacks.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Although price action trading is a popular and effective method of trading, it is not without its problems. Here are some common problems associated with trading price action:Subjectivity: Price action trading is based on interpreting price movements and patterns, which can be subjective and open to interpretation. Traders may have different opinions on the same price movement, leading to conflicting signals and confusion. Complex analysis: Price action trading can be complex and require a deep understanding of technical analysis and chart patterns. Novice traders may struggle to interpret price movements and patterns, leading to poor decision-making. False signals: Price action trading can generate false signals, especially in choppy or ranging markets where price action is erratic. These false signals can lead to losses and frustration for traders. Lack of indicators: Price action trading relies solely on price movements and patterns, without the use of technical indicators. Some traders may prefer the added clarity and confirmation provided by technical indicators. Emotional bias: Price action trading requires a disciplined and objective approach, which can be difficult for some traders to maintain. Emotional biases, such as fear and greed, can cloud judgment and lead to poor decision-making. In summary, while price action trading can be a powerful and effective method of trading, it requires discipline, experience, and a deep understanding of technical analysis. Traders should be aware of the potential drawbacks and limitations of price action trading and should use it in conjunction with other forms of analysis.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Although fundamental analysis can be a powerful tool in forex trading, it is not without its problems. Here are some common problems associated with using fundamental analysis in forex trading:Complexity: Fundamental analysis can be complex and require a deep understanding of macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Novice traders may struggle to interpret economic data and news events, leading to poor decision-making. Delayed effects: Economic data and news events may have a delayed effect on the currency markets, and their impact may not be immediately reflected in prices. Traders may need to be patient and wait for the market to react to the news. Unforeseeable events: Fundamental analysis is based on predicting the impact of economic and political events on the currency markets. However, unforeseeable events, such as natural disasters or unexpected political developments, can disrupt the markets and lead to unexpected outcomes. Conflicting data: Economic data and news events can sometimes conflict with each other, leading to confusion and conflicting signals. Traders may need to use their judgment to determine which data points are the most relevant. Lack of precision: Economic data can be subject to revisions and may not always be accurate. Traders may need to take these inaccuracies into account when interpreting economic data. In summary, while fundamental analysis can be a powerful tool in forex trading, it requires a deep understanding of macroeconomic and geopolitical events, and traders must be prepared for unexpected developments. Traders should also be aware of the potential drawbacks and limitations of fundamental analysis and use it in conjunction with other forms of analysis.

Excellent work

BTW, Trading LTF is more stress full and could lead to trading, and losing emotional control is possible.

Sometimes trading it may be good.

If you have complete control it's okay.

I know the feeling. It's SO easy to do stupid things or miss something obvious in this game. But just need to assess the reasons why we do such things and put steps in place to make sure it doesn't happen in the future. We usually berate ourselves but this is the worst thing you can do. There must have been some logic we used to make the decision and just need to identify why it was flawed and fix it for future decisions.

Good luck!

This three are possible to sell entries in the Gold H1 chart today.

anyone can tell thousands of names but the concept of Day trades setups is simple.

6 EMA is our momentum. 21EMA is our trend.

EMA zone is our Equiliverious when stop loss is small. when the price goes too far away from the zone I don't like to open trade because of large sl or risk.

I don't use 200 ema anymore because I like to trade swing I don't want to miss counter-trend swing against 200ema. But I do like 6Day ema momentum and 21DAy ema trend when I trade the H1 chart. The color ema I have shared in my profile is a very very good ema indicator my opinion.

I love to trade medium size swings of the market. we all know forex is not like stock it doesn't give large swings too often.

I can see some of the traders are trading very well with this strategy. It makes me feel so happy.

Best of luck everyone.

Nice, I would have entered a little later. That next engulf after the one you entered on would have been perfect. Just because it's a better confirm of change in structure. Entering on the engulf might have not given you a good R:R so waiting for a pullback would have worked well in this case! But still nice one. It was a good pick for M5 after that H1 close.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
the reason was just the blue rectangle, a supportzone. i dont exit with RR, in fact i exit just when i have enough profit and the price seems to hit resistance or support from the chart.

Not good trade but took the trade.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
setting stop loss requires skills and market understanding.

There are many ways to set stop loss.

I din't discuss setting stop-loss here before.

we can set stop loss below or above the EMA zone.

we can set stop loss below swing low or high.

we could set stop loss below or above the candle.

Hope it will improve your trading.

we have a trading strategy and we know our strategy is designed for taking advantage of market moves.

sometimes we fake loss after loss because market conditions are slow. what we have to do is stop trading for the day. The patient is the key.

we all know it. It is not what we make it is about how can we protect our capital.

Best wishes all

I wanted to show you Trading techniques with the framework of Day trade setups.

I have tested it in GJ it gives more than a 72% win rate with 1 to 2 or more up to 4 RR.

The average is 3RR. I recorded the video unfortunately after 10 minutes Recording stopped.

I will try to record again if possible in one video I will explain this technique. Let's see

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Yes please Hasib, camping and waiting.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
unfortunately, my free recording software is not allowing me to record more than 10 minutes.

Hope soon I will figure it out new ways to record video.

I have shared the 10 minutes records on our youtube channel. hope the concept will help you to understand.

On average I get 2 to 3 RR from each trade with this technique. some time get more.

It was an excellent trade. but it would be best to enter when the price broke the Trend line.

I can it TL break entry with Daily open line confluence.

you are doing well.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
unfortunately no.

in The last video, I discussed trading the trend with the directions with 21 ema.

Look for a counter-trend candle and trade the break out of that candle with the directions of 21 ema.

when I will open the trade I will share pictures here. I hope in the next video you will find lots of examples.

thank you!

yes i know...i was sleeping at that time

thank you!

well i was sleeping and when i woke up i saw TL was broken and i am a bit late. so before breakfast i entered the trade.

its nothing special, i just love charts;-)

after a good trade or around lunchtime i go for a long walk. that is important to have the brain clean and fresh for afternoon. 2-3 hours NYSE and then i stop trading when london is closed the latest.

NJ Nice one, just a smooth trend. I personally would have waited for a HH and a pullback. So that first H1 push around NY open would have been the perfect entry IMO.

GJ, I was seeing a zone just above where you entered that I needed price to clear. Once it was obvious it was moving with momentum I tried for a PO but price just went. I'm not usually a fan of entries like yours in these cases but I'm going to keep a note of this and watch this in the future. Thanks.

Don't be confused,  the template I have shared here.

I am showing the concept of trading trends as well as showing the power of each tool in our system. if you still don't understand I recommend just observing other people's trade here. It will help you to learn.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
here is an example of yesterdays goldtrade and what to look for. hapily TP was hit during my sleep;-)

--- 帖子 #464 ---
some newbies saying they are confused. EMA super trend  and MACD

where they are confused I don't know.

I don't have the power to install the system in their brain. To generate profit with this system you have to do your homework right.

I can see traders who are practicing posting their trade here they will improve their trading with this system day by day. their win rate will improve their RR will improve. their chart reading power will improve. It is practice and hard work that makes the difference, just installing a profitable system does not make you a profitable trader.

Unfortunately this trade stop out.

After taking all the stop losses. Price now moving with the trend directions.

Re-entry reason. The price is still above the daily open line.

Rejection of daily open line. Price momentum (6ema) h1 is still bullish. Price Trend(21) H1 is still bullish.

stop lose this time is 20 pips and tp is 50 pips. 1 to 2.5RR 3 trade I have open.

Treacherous conditions today.

GJ was a nice trade.

GU was a little risky as it was counter-trend, but the risk paid off. It was a small miracle I didn't take taken out at B/E.

I really like that indicator with the all the candles from various timeframes. In my opinion, it's the most key indicator out there. Makes scalping SO much easier. One glance you can see all timeframes and even multiple candles. Would highly recommend it to anyone.

Took a loss on trying to long gold. Nothing too wrong with the trade but just went for my SL first unfortunately.

I believe this needs no complex explanations as it is easy to follow and rarely get things wrong.

The multiple BB are obvious entry exit points in combination with the combo stochs (direction as well as the levels that are VERY important) and the rsx which is again obvious for entry/exit as well as divergence which is commonly overlooked.

Extremeties are BB in black and white.

All indicators attached as is the template.

A truly profitable day trading system but only for those who trade for long periods of time.

Ah, So if it's all green or all red then means we are in process of making a new HH/LL.

If it's not all green but the last signal was all green then I take it to mean price is just doing a pullback on that timeframe. So if we are up we are making a HL and if we are down making a LH. This is the assumption until it turns all green/red again.

Ultimately this is just a quick reference for something that should be obvious when looking at basic structure. I've had a look at the maths of the indicator and essentially it's a fancy breakout system.

I look at this on all TFs.

I do take counter-trend trades as well but only if I see a nice pattern (mostly H&S) but these are more risky.

That's about it!

Congratulations.

Focusing on trending pairs. try to take 1 to 2 RR at the list for trade, it will give you more % gain.

Not applying this strategy in Ranging pairs like usdcad, eurusd. It self will give you a good edge.

Thank you for the advices! It wouldn't have been possible without you.

For stop lose and Take profit place I use this indicator.

ATR STOP Loss and ATR take profit.

for 1 to 2 RR trade I use 1.5 ATR stop and 3 ATR TP.

you can also use 3 ATR take profit and 6 ATR TP.

Test what works for you.

For ATR stop loss and Filter out some trade you can also use a super trend indicator. with 12 and 3 ATR value.

Chart GPT give me this strategy

The triple Super Trend trading strategy combines three Super Trend indicators with different settings to help identify potential trends in a security. Here are the settings and rules for entry and exit for this strategy:

Settings:Super Trend 1: period 10, multiplier 2 Super Trend 2: period 15, multiplier 3 Super Trend 3: period 20, multiplier 4 Entry Rules:Wait for all three Super Trend indicators to align in the same direction. Enter a long (buy) position if all three Super Trend indicators are green, or a short (sell) position if all three Super Trend indicators are red. Exit Rules:Set a stop-loss order below the recent swing low if you enter a long position, or above the recent swing high if you enter a short position. Set a profit target based on your risk-reward ratio or use a trailing stop to capture profits as the price continues to move in your favor. Exit the trade if any of the Super Trend indicators change color, indicating a potential trend reversal. It's important to note that no trading strategy can guarantee success, so always use proper risk management techniques and consider the potential risks before entering any trades. Additionally, it's recommended to backtest this strategy on historical data to determine its effectiveness before using it in live trading.

I've spent a while in the past playing with EAs and never managed anything that I thought was worth pursuing. IMO, this could work over a long enough time period but I'm personally not looking at developing EAs at the moment. However you would need something a little more sophisticated for SL placement which should ideally be below structure. Can use zigzag to determine structure. Also may be worth considering when to put to b/e.

I would strongly recommend working with a programmer to do this properly if you are serious. Lots are available on UpWork. ChatGPT is amazing but the code is full of errors and needs a working knowledge of MQL4 to get it working.

shame about EA, on HTF the trade looked real good. I just didn't see an entry that I liked.

Also nicely done with GU. I saw a SnR zone at your entry which is why I couldn't enter. Often at these zones price can pull back quite significantly or just blast through them. In this case it went through it with momentum.

Nice morning for you! I'm still stuck in Gold, can't believe it's still active.

Gold and GU were exactly like this yesterday as well. The real key is how to identify the strong trend because as you said, it doesn't happen every day. It could also just be a big push fakeout. Do you have any tips? At what point would you start looking for entries?

For me personally I use a strong H1 push and how price reacts to SnR levels in the market, but wondering what your approach is?

Your right. We try to take advantage of trend and market momentum.

GU M15, looks like I got a little lucky in the morning.

Once structure turned bearish, I started looking for shorts. I'm not 100% sure about the range here as HTF is very bullish but with scalping I (almost always) put to breakeven fast. Tight stops mean I can't weather much of a pullback.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Ended breakeven with a M15 engulf up. Was hoping for a move down before news but now my guess is price just waiting for news but let's see what things look like after news.

Overtrading can be a common problem for many traders, as it can lead to excessive risk-taking and poor decision-making. Here are some tips to help you stop overtrading:Create a trading plan: Having a clear trading plan that outlines your entry and exit points, risk management strategy, and overall goals can help you stay focused and avoid impulsive trades. Set trading limits: Establishing trading limits, such as the number of trades you will make per day or week, can help you avoid overtrading. Once you have reached your trading limit, stop trading for the day or week. Stick to your strategy: Stick to your trading strategy and avoid deviating from it based on emotions or short-term market movements. This will help you make more informed trading decisions and avoid overtrading. Take breaks: Taking regular breaks from trading can help you clear your mind and avoid impulsive trades. Consider taking a break from trading for a day or two if you find yourself overtrading. Monitor your trading activity: Keep track of your trading activity, including your profits and losses, to identify patterns of overtrading. This can help you make necessary adjustments to your trading plan and behavior. Seek support: Consider seeking support from a trading mentor or coach who can help you develop strategies to avoid overtrading and improve your overall trading performance. Remember that overtrading can be detrimental to your trading success, so it is important to take steps to address it. By implementing these tips and strategies, you can avoid overtrading and improve your trading performance over the long term.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
There are several reasons why people may overtrade:Greed: Some traders may overtrade because they are driven by the desire to make more money quickly. This can lead to excessive risk-taking and impulsive trading decisions. Fear of missing out (FOMO): FOMO can lead traders to enter and exit trades based on short-term market movements, rather than sticking to their trading plan. This can result in overtrading and poor decision-making. Addiction to trading: Trading can be exciting and addictive, leading some traders to overtrade and take unnecessary risks in order to experience the rush of trading. Lack of discipline: Traders who lack discipline and fail to follow their trading plan may overtrade and make impulsive trading decisions. Lack of knowledge or experience: Traders who lack knowledge or experience may overtrade in an attempt to learn quickly or make up for losses. Overconfidence: Traders who are overconfident in their abilities may take on more risk than they can handle, leading to overtrading and poor performance. Overall, overtrading can be caused by a combination of emotional and behavioral factors. It is important for traders to identify the root causes of their overtrading and take steps to address them in order to improve their trading performance over the long term.

@hasib and @T221 seem to have experience of live trade money management. I have these two indicators one should calculate position size based on ATR, percentage risk (default 2%); the other should also calculate lot size based on AT, risk by US$, defaault 50$. The confusion is why the ATR setting should be default different in both calculations if only the type of risk changed, I found no manual for them but the results seems much to low lot size. If I set ATR(14) then 1% 0f 5000 is 50$, I could not get both results matched! Is the calculation right at all?

if you could test and tell if the result is realistic or wrong compare what you normally set for a 5000$ account max daily draw down should be 5%.that would be very helpful for me to start

i didnt watch the whole 3 hours, but at least 45 minutes. Fast forward, so to speak;-)

its just to get a feeling how this guy thinks and acts. even if he is not the best trader, the process of his challenge over many days was interesting.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thank you sharing this Hasib. Nice long weekend to find time to watch it! Was really interesting. Esp as he is a scalper. The guy had a 35% win rate and one big R trade with a wild equity curve. Was quite a journey. Especially his moments of bad judgement with gold. It's interesting he passed the challenge with one big trade and such a low overall win rate. The way he scaled into his trade while keeping his risk constant was interesting.

I'm sure we can all relate to getting confused when trading. Doesn't happen as often any more to me personally but I remember well when it was the norm. It's also quite clear that his negative emotional state in both trading and life in general just compounded his losses. Learning to cultivate a positive emotional state and trading in that state independent of what life throws at you is the key. Trading really teaches you to develop this. Sufism (Rumi), Buddhism etc all preach the same thing and give you good techniques on how to emotionally reset after bad days. The good, the bad are just two sides of the same coin. Duality at play. The only key is to make the best decisions possible by minimising the bad and capitalising on the good. Luck is nothing more than opportunity meeting preparation whilst in a positive state of mind. It's almost impossible to make the best decision possible in a bad emotional state and this shows that. He doesn't show anything on analysing his losses but I think that's also important. Must be done, again, from an emotionally neutral state and pure curiosity into the decision making process. Overall really interesting. Cheers!

Those who think it's worth watching.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
A discretionary trader is a student of the price chart. They interpret their emotions and thought and risk management concept in the chart. Chart reading is addicting and a chart reader may have less win rate but yet they have their own confidence over their concept they can manage their emotions and trade win and lose through the chart interpretations. An indicator-based system may be given a high win rate but if a trader can not apply their thought they will always fill they miss something they will have a hard time implementing their trade and accepting loss.   That is why I don't recommend using HA candle at all. I always feel if your system is close to a pure candle chart and trader imaginations come close to the market chart it generates positive emotions and positive return end results. If you are a long time student of the market you probably know most ema or sma-based systems don't have a positive edge if you put them into the Algo test, yet experience traders use those and generate profit. why!! It is luck! it is gambling ability!! I would say no. it is the chart reading and waiting for the right emotions or motions of the market.

ChatGpt gave me this strategy. I have to backtest it.

If you found it interesting you could apply the techniques. In 22 day months if we get 3 to 4 opportunity and if we lose 2 trade and win 1 or 2 trade with 1 to 3 rr it would be a great achievement.

Here is a profitable breakout trading strategy for GBP/USD on the one-hour time frame:Identify a range: Look for a consolidation period on the one-hour chart where the GBP/USD price is trading within a range or channel for at least 20-25 candles. Set entry orders: Once a range has been identified, place two entry orders outside the range: one to buy if the price breaks above the range's high and another to sell if the price breaks below the range's low. Set stop-loss orders: Place a stop-loss order for each trade at a distance equal to half the range's size from the entry point. Set take-profit orders: Set a take-profit order for each trade at a distance equal to the range's size from the entry point. Risk management: Ensure that your risk-to-reward ratio is at least 1:2 or better. Exit strategy: If the trade hits the take-profit order, exit the trade. If the trade hits the stop-loss order, exit the trade. Money management: Use proper money management techniques, such as risking no more than 1-2% of your account balance per trade. Avoid trading during major news releases or events that can cause significant market volatility. Remember, no trading strategy can guarantee profits, and it's important to constantly monitor the market conditions and adjust your approach accordingly.

Hedge funds been using AI for years, specifically machine learning. I keep an eye on this space but haven't seen anything mind blowing just yet.

Right now the new tools are amazing as a sounding board. They don't focus so much on what's true but what's possible. Which is great for creative insight. Also a god send for amateur coders.

Hello Mate:

ChatGpt caught my eye. There's an  indicator that shows the ranges for N number of bars. 24 didn't really show much but when I switched to 8 ( 8 hours in a trading session ) things looked interesting. Tradiing the H4 high/low breaks in the London and NY sessions can generate a few  .

From 8 to 16 bars ago, there wasn't much range expansion.  Then on bar 7, the range was broken.  Will have to watch this.

Thanks and Cheers!

Once you have a good system you Backtest and forward test it and develop intuitions and skills over time from your Notes.

The profitability depends on what you do after a winning trade or a losing trade.

Self-control. No matter what happens don't trade more than 3 trades in a day with Day trade setups. It will make you profitable.

The entry was possibly a little aggressive here but I really thought there was momentum building for a push to the upside. I was only going for 15 pips and would have moved it to breakeven fast but there was no opportunity in this case. I was expecting a big candle up the next candle but it came down. This is trading, first loss of the week. It looks like I got the direction wrong in this case but it looked clear to me at the time.

SL hit.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Re-Entry.

Trade was not invalidated so re-entered. Once price made a new HH, I move the SL to 3 pips. Very little risk left on the trade. Price can still spike to my entry so any spike to my entry and I will move to B/E.

You had the direction right but just lots of spikes today.

For me, personally, GU wasn't the best because of the daily. Highly bullish and today's move is the first change in structure on lower timeframes so always a little risky IMO.

Haven't seen anything worth taking today after EA. Days like this sometimes there are some very clean moves around market close but I doubt I'll be around that long today.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
this kind of change of structure can trade with my Daily open line concept. when we see the price close below the daily open line and the price could not get over it we could easily take some positions for downside continuations this is the Day trade setups strategy concept.

if you look at this chart you will be clear.

The question is where will I enter? In the H1 chart, I will enter at 2 white candles close and I will place a stop above the daily open line

when setup is in your mind everything will be very clear

Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #633 ---
yes, we so far using the 6 and 21 zones in our day trade setups. In the video you see using the default setting of color ema which is 25 has a 50% win rate with 1 to 2 RR.

If you like to use 6 and 25 ema. that will be also fine.

The concept is trading most of the time trading with the direction of the trend and momentum.

Am in this, XAUUSD M30. That big black candle down made no sense and I entered after the first M30 white candle on a small retrace.

Very very tricky conditions today. This one finished at a very small partial loss, almost breakeven, as well. There was one more run for liquidity before the push I was looking for which was unfortunate but such is trading! I was looking for longs with that big push down but didn't see anything.

Hope others are fairing better than me this week!

I don't focus on monthly profits, I just try and execute perfectly and then the rest is up to the trading gods  Almost all my trades are 1.5R and I focus more on win rate than R.

From last Friday things have been a bit more tricky than usual, but this is normal. There are times of clarity and times where things are a little messier depending on the order flow going through the market. Also we will never execute 100% perfectly all the time. I remember when I first started, when things weren't clear I would get a lot of losses but now I am able to see when things are not clear and just reduce my trade frequency. This is the biggest market in the world and as such, there will be times where our patterns just don't present.

Not that I'm an expert as it's the only muslim festival I've heard of. Nothing wrong with wishing someone well during a yearly religious event IMO.

EA M1

Direction looks clear on all TFs to me and saw momentum coming out of Asia. These are the kinds of entries I try and get and the minute price pushes in my favour I put the position to breakeven. Once at breakeven, it's either B/E or TP. My principle aim is capital protection and therefore winrate excluding the breakevens. I get a lot of trades where it comes and takes me out and goes to TP but I can't filter these from the ones it come down to my SL as this strategy is pure scalping for me so have very tight stops. The odds of the trade not finishing at breakeven just seems to depend on the momentum of the move. This one survived.

15 pips TP for 1.5R.

Lines are limits of supertrend indicator. If you are trading this as it should be traded, your SL should trail these lines. It's similar to a donchian channel but more advanced. You would need to have a look at the calculations to really understand how it works but all you really need to know is it's a volatility adjusted donchian channel.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
That was a concept, not any rules.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
With the DAy trade setup, we could use Super Trend or ATR-based stop.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
This is a good indicator to place a stop and understand multiple time frame trend directions in one chart.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
The placement of a stop-loss order is a crucial part of managing risk in Forex trading. A stop-loss order is an instruction to close a trade at a specific price level, limiting the amount of loss a trader can incur if the trade goes against them.

The placement of a stop-loss order depends on various factors, such as market conditions, trading strategy, risk tolerance, and the currency pair being traded. Here are a few general guidelines to consider when placing a stop-loss order:Support and Resistance Levels: Consider placing the stop-loss order just below a support level when buying or just above a resistance level when selling. Support and resistance levels are levels where the price has previously bounced off, suggesting that there is a higher probability of the price rebounding from that level. Volatility: Consider placing the stop-loss order outside the normal price range to account for market volatility. A more volatile currency pair may require a wider stop-loss order to avoid being stopped out too early. Timeframe: The timeframe of the chart being used can also influence the placement of the stop-loss order. A trader using a shorter timeframe may require a tighter stop-loss order than a trader using a longer timeframe. Trading Strategy: Different trading strategies may require different placement of the stop-loss order. For example, a trend-following strategy may require a wider stop-loss order to allow for the market to move in the direction of the trend. Ultimately, the placement of a stop-loss order should be determined by the trader's risk tolerance, trading strategy, and analysis of the market conditions. It's essential to use appropriate money management techniques, such as position sizing, to ensure that the risk is controlled and kept within an acceptable level.

REALLY nice trade. Fakeout of the upside and PERFECT entry. Very very very nice. Thanks for the chart, I traded something very similar to this for some time. You can post these kinds of trades in the "Fun Factory: Interactive for Day Traders" chat. I find it extremely useful to see charts of different styles/traders. I post my other trades there.

Hello everyone,
I hope you're enjoying a great weekend.

I would like to thank Hasib for everything he is sharing in this thread. I've been following along and I've practised the strategy for a bit until this week.
Since Monday 24th of April I traded live with Hasib's strategy for the first time and I'm happy to share my results. The net profit of the week was $492.00 (approx. 5% of the account): balance drawdown was just 2%, while equity drawdown never reached 3%. I always risked 100$ (approx. 1%) with a RR ratio of 1:2 and I watched only the 15 minutes timeframe.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I achived this result with 13 trades, which means that I'm trading consistently and it wasn't just pure luck.

I would like to be more active in the thread, so if anyone has questions, thoughts or trades to share, I'm here!
Feel free to get in touch

keeping everything simple is help us understand Price Structure in a better way.

when the price is in a long time range we should use a level to counter the market.

The triple super trend Indicator is still there it will help us understand the higher tf trend.

forex example if the Daily triple super trend is Green we will look for H1 triple super trend to be reand and then green. It will help us traindg the right pull back.

It's about getting a better price to buy or sell. S&D is a useful tool.

Gold was bought at the H1 demand zone. yesterday. It was a 1 to 5RR trade.

If we could get 1 to 5RR trade only 25% win rate is good enough to be make large profit.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
thought this supply level will work. close 50% with 1+RR. rest I hold for 1 to 5RR but unfortunately sell trade hit stop.

with the directions of the higher tf Triple super trend trading gives good results than just trading random supply and demand level. just a thought.

I know previously other sell trade works well in this gold chart

--- 帖子 #743 ---
GJ price breaks yesterday's high and the price moves below the daily open line. gives a Triple super trend sell entry.

It was quite a good sell entry. price is at the daily zone. if price come up if we get good opportunity we will sell again .

Forex Blast RSI Trading Strategy is just another great invention for effective trading and very much ideal for professional forex scalpers & intraday traders.

Blast RSI trading strategy is a combination of two indicators named Classy Blast and DACOPEN. The goal of this indicator is to catch the momentum of a trendy market with a better point of entry and exit.

Blast RSI strategy is famous for spotting both trend condition and current price sentiment at the same time that allows a trader to lead a more relaxing everyday trading life.Classy Blast: Located at the first indicator window. Though it looks like a combination of various colors but actually it is very easy to read. Whenever Classy Blast changes its color means the change of current price movement sentiment to the opposite direction. If you see there is no color or it is blank, that means current price sentiment is neutral or you can say market is just taking a nap and you should not knock the market while it is napping. That is a rule you should remember! DACOPEN: You’ll find it at the second window. This is a trend indicator that tells you the condition of current market trend. DACOPEN is red indicates bullish and red indicates bearishness of the present market trend. Forex Blast RSI Trading Strategy: Buy ParametersClassy Blast color changes to green/yellow DACOPEN turns into white color Set stop loss limit below the signaling bar low Take profit when Classy Blast color changes an DACOPEN turns into red Forex Blast RSI Trading Strategy: Sell Parameters Classy Blast color changes to red/maroon DACOPEN turns into red color Set stop loss limit above the signaling bar high Take profit when Classy Blast color changes an DACOPEN turns into white

classy(Tahwaid) Vhi this version of your system works pretty well.

At a glance, I can see 7 trade win and 4 trades lose this system

RR how much?

Which pair you trade?

Which tf you use?

GJ 1:2RR h1 chart I have 59% +-

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I follow these pairs AUDUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDJPY, CHFJPY, CADJPY, EURAUD, EURCAD, EURGBP, EURJPY, GBPJPY, NZDUSD, NZDUSD, XAUUSD.

TF - When the main trend is verified and D1, H4, and H1 match the trend. Then I look for a pullback on M5.

RR is not set in stone, can be between 1:1 - 1:3, or sometimes/often I close by my hand if the market seems uncertain.

The biggest problem for me is that I can only trade 1-2 hours after the London close because I work. Only have Friday when I can sit down with the computer and focus. Well, Friday is not the best trading day either. I think it's pretty good after all with 52% win with 180 trades in these circumstances.

Hey everyone,
I hope you had a great week.

I would like to share the result of trading live the DTS strategy. Last week (Mon 24th -> Fri 28th of April 2023) I was happy to share nice gains: it was my first week trading live the DTS strategy and I enjoyed a great net profit. Be sure to check my previous post if you haven't.

I can't be as happy this week (Mon 1st -> Fri 5th of May 2023): the net profit of the week is -75.42$ (approx. -0.75% of the balance). Theoretically I had to break-even, but considering commissions and slippage I had a small loss. Max balance drawdown reached approx. 4% and max equity drawdown hit 4.5%. I always risked 100$ (approx. 1%) with a RR ratio of 1:2 and traded only the 15 minute time frame. Feel free to check the trades:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So, what happened here? Quite a lot, even if the net profit is close to zero (in % of balance).

I made 2 big mistakes this week:I opened 3 trades in low liquidity periods. As you can see from the screenshot, there are 3 trades that have a volume close to 3 lots: as I said, I always risk 1% per position, so that means either the stop-loss was really tight OR the liquidity was really low. I always use the same rule to place the stop-loss, so it surely is the second guess. During the week big news came out and liquidity wasn't always there. I made the mistake of not caring and it backfired: huge commissions and lost trades. Why's that? If there is low liquidity, the market won't move as usual: you completely lose your probabilistic advantage. I opened 1 trade late. Trying to catch up, I opened the AUDNZD trade 1 candle late: the price was still around the theoretical opening price, but the fact that the price was still there suggested a weak trend. These mistakes account for a net loss of 348.97$. If it wasn't for the human errors, I would be enjoying some nice profits (close to 300$, approx. 3% of the balance) even this week. While it isn't practical to think of ifs and buts, it surely helps to look backwards and check what mistakes were made along the way: I strongly suggest everyone to do so.
As usual, feel free to ask questions, give feedback and provide useful tips.

To the next week!

TP Hit.

Strategy Conceptual framework

You don't have to trade every day look for better setups and execute trade.

The Strategy is simple.Trade with the Directions of the 21 EMA and 6 EMA. ( you can use 21 EMA as your Baseline too) Triple Super trend indicator 10:2, 20:2, 30:2 settings, You can use histo version or the CAndle version. ( Triple super trend indicator is primary confirmation) For the stop loss can use Super Trend 10:4 or Swing Low. I recommend using a little large stop lose instead of placing a stop below the entry candle. For High Low Break understanding or Range Break out you can use 20 Donchian Channel without the middle line. ( You can say it is your Volatility indicator) GJ,CJ, in those pair breakout entry work, so you can trade 20DC Breakout too.

Trade Trending pair- Gbpjpy, CADJPY, EurJpy, CHFJPY, ( GA, EA, GC,EC, When they are trending apply this strategy)

Another point, Pick a TF for the pair you trading and execute trade only that TF, You can analyze other tf but Execute trade one TF. It will help you gain confidence.

Best of Luck

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Hasib, thanks for posting the method and clarifications.

Question: the settings for the histo indi should be the same (i.e. 10:2, 20:2, 30:2)?

Thanks.

HI
Emekuzydawiz

if 21 ema and Triple Super trend colors are the same you can buy whenRelative Strength Index (RSI) with period = 14 Entry Rules:Buy when RSI crosses above 50 from below. Sell when RSI crosses below 50 from above. Exit Rules:For long trades, exit when RSI crosses below 70. For short trades, exit when RSI crosses above 30. Test it with your TF and your Trading pair

Best of luck.

I am getting lots of questions in the Discord group and private messages.

One of the questions is Do I use MACD?

MACD was my favorite indicator but Currently, I don't use them. Because I have found MACD doesn't work well in the Forex market. Several algo tests already proved it. some of the studies you will find it online for free. MACD works a little bit in the Treding pair but we have better tools than MACD.

Those who are posting in this thread and trying to learn something that will add value to your trading. You probably get messages from some idiots. I have previously exposed him in the TMS thread. I have ended that chapter. Unfortunately, they can't forget those. They read my post. Trust me I don't read them because I know what they are capable of. Anyway. Don't get discouraged.

Good traders do not use indicators it is a wrong concept. little knowledge is dangerous.

we do use proven strategy in our trading group. we have a small group of individuals in our private community in Discord where I have already shared some of the very good ways to trade. some of the hard-working people backtested it and find it very good.

If you want to improve your trading and want to do some hard work join me in the Discord group. Trust me your trading will change you will start to do good.
You will never find me messaging you against other people in FF. That is the difference between me and them.

People will always have big words like smart money dumb money and so on, These is the marketing words to take money from you by selling their course.

Trading a method you see is profitable is much better than trading opinion. like war is going on so the price will move up and holding buy trade with 500 pips stop loss. Next time when they use Big words and message you against other ff members. politely ask them to share their 1 years trading track record.

I Draw Attention to Forex Factory Moderate to discourage Hate private messages against other members.

I don't post my trade every day because I don't trade every day, I don't have to do that. I don't trade every single move of the market. I don't know all about trading I never claim it.

Keep practicing and you will see light.
Best of luck

I recommend all the traders follow one style. if your money flow I mean a trend follower or a swing flow trader stick with the style.

Don't follow others it will make you suffer more. why I am saying it is because I know your popular guru more than you do. I am here on this Forum for a long time.

Only follow my system if you find it profitable more than 50% of the time with 1 to 2 RR with my recommended pair, otherwise don't follow DST also. DST has the winning edge you just did not find it. Sad but true you need to do some hard work. do some Backtest and forward tests.

I don't want to do it but let me show you one of the most popular traders here in ff. He probably private messages you against me.

Only the demo traders and Idiot will buy there. I will never buy that place because it is a newbie like trading. Thinking that I will counter every possible market move.

Newbies try to change the world but they can't change themself. anyway if you have some basic technical analysis skills you will easily understand why you don't want to buy that place. go see my strategy chart and you will understand why and where we should buy and where we should wait for a good opportunity. Buying and holding a trade for 500 pips loss is not the way to trade we have a better way which is efficient. how it knows it, through algo testing and manual testing and forward testing I know it. not all markets move the same but not all idiots learn from their mistakes.

This is the setup taught by a very good course seller. he makes a lot of money selling this strategy setup. he has one other setup. He makes money trading this setup live too. He trades h1 Tf only. If you know him you know what I am talking about. Not all understand it. To trade this setup you don't need any indicator but if you trade this setup with a day trade setups strategy you will find a higher win rate.

I have a few good setups over the years I have developed and learned from good people. This is one of them, I can show FTMO interview they pass the prop firm challenge and make a good amount of money just trading this setup. it is powerful but It will only work for you when you give time and practice.

The Triple Super Trend strategy combines the concept of trend following with multiple timeframes to generate trading signals. Here's how you can implement the Triple Super Trend strategy:

Step 1: Select the timeframe Choose three different timeframes for analysis. For example, you could use daily, 4-hour, and 1-hour charts. Each timeframe represents a different perspective on the market.

Step 2: Analyze the Super Trend on each timeframe Apply the Super Trend indicator to each timeframe.

Step 3: Identify trading signals To generate trading signals, you can consider the following rules:Buy Signal: When the Super Trend line on the shorter timeframe (e.g., 1-hour) changes from bearish (red) to bullish (green), and both the medium timeframe (e.g., 4-hour) and longer timeframe (e.g., daily) Super Trend lines are already bullish.  Sell Signal: When the Super Trend line on the shorter timeframe changes from bullish (green) to bearish (red), and both the medium and longer timeframe Super Trend lines are already bearish. Step 4: Execute trades and manage risk Once you have identified a trading signal, you can enter a trade in the direction of the trend. It's important to implement proper risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and using appropriate position sizing.

Remember that no trading strategy guarantees profits, and it's essential to thoroughly test and adapt any strategy to suit your trading style and risk tolerance.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Position sizing is a crucial aspect of forex trading as it determines the amount of capital you allocate to each trade based on your risk tolerance and account size. Proper position sizing helps manage risk and maintain consistent trading performance. Here are some common position sizing rules and methods:Fixed Percentage Risk:Determine a fixed percentage of your trading capital that you are willing to risk on each trade. For example, 2% or 3% is a commonly used risk percentage. Calculate the dollar amount you can risk by multiplying your account balance by the risk percentage. Divide the dollar risk amount by the stop loss distance in pips to determine the position size. This gives you the number of lots or units to trade.  Fixed Dollar Risk:Decide on a fixed dollar amount that you are willing to risk per trade. Calculate the risk percentage by dividing the fixed dollar risk by your account balance. Determine the position size by dividing the fixed dollar risk by the stop loss distance in pips.  Volatility-Based Position Sizing:Measure the volatility of the currency pair you are trading using indicators like Average True Range (ATR) or Bollinger Bands. Adjust your position size based on the current volatility. For example, you may decide to reduce position size during high volatility periods to account for larger potential price swings.  Kelly Criterion:The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal position size based on the probability of success and the risk-reward ratio. Calculate the Kelly Criterion by using the following formula: Position Size (%) = (Winning Probability - Losing Probability) / Risk-Reward Ratio The result will indicate the percentage of your trading capital to allocate to each trade.  It's important to note that position sizing alone does not guarantee profitability. It should be combined with a solid trading strategy and risk management techniques. Additionally, consider using appropriate stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and trailing stops to protect profits as the trade moves in your favor.

Regularly review and adjust your position sizing rules based on your trading performance, account size, and risk tolerance. Keep in mind that risk management is key to long-term success in forex trading.

Analyzing and reviewing your trades is essential for improving your forex trading performance. Here are ten trade review rules to help you evaluate your trades effectively:Review your trade setup: Assess the quality of your trade setup based on your trading strategy's criteria. Determine if the trade met your entry rules and if there were any additional factors that influenced your decision. Analyze the market context: Consider the overall market conditions at the time of the trade. Review the prevailing trend, support and resistance levels, economic news releases, or any other relevant factors that may have impacted the trade's outcome. Evaluate risk management: Assess your risk management practices, including your position sizing, stop-loss placement, and take-profit levels. Determine if your risk-to-reward ratio was appropriate and if you followed your risk management rules. Examine trade execution: Analyze how well you executed the trade. Assess whether you entered and exited the trade according to your plan or if there were any execution errors or delays that may have affected the outcome. Review trade duration: Consider the duration of the trade and whether it aligned with your initial expectations. Determine if you exited too early or held on for too long, based on your analysis and strategy. Monitor emotions: Reflect on your emotional state during the trade. Assess whether emotions, such as fear, greed, or impatience, influenced your decision-making process. Identify any patterns or areas for improvement in managing your emotions. Analyze trade outcomes: Evaluate the outcome of the trade, whether it resulted in a profit or a loss. Determine if the outcome was aligned with your expectations and if there were any unexpected price movements or market events that affected the trade. Keep a trading journal: Maintain a detailed trading journal to record all relevant trade information, including entry and exit points, reasoning behind the trade, and your emotional state. This journal will help you track patterns, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make data-driven improvements. Identify patterns and trends: Look for recurring patterns, trends, or common mistakes in your trades. This analysis can help you identify areas for improvement, such as consistently missing entry signals, exiting trades prematurely, or failing to follow your trading plan. Adjust your trading plan: Based on your trade review, make necessary adjustments to your trading plan, risk management strategies, or trading rules. Continuously refine and adapt your approach based on your trade analysis to enhance your future trading performance. Trade review should be an ongoing process to continually learn and grow as a trader. By implementing these trade review rules, you can gain valuable insights into your trading decisions and improve your overall trading effectiveness.

Hello Hasib. Thank you for all of your contributions to this thread and this strategy. I hope all is well.

I have read through quite a few pages and I am still unclear about the exact rules for this strategy. Can you please direct me to the original thread in 2013, or a page were the rules are outlined? Thanks in advanced.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Hello everyone

just scalping trade open quickly drag sl to BE by looking m1 tf. I know it's us market open. The market will move. hit tp 50 pips

Risky trade when you are in profit and have proper control in your mind you can do this kind of trade but doing it regularly may not good.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Just quick Break out trade. That is it, Other indicators give confluence. There is no magic.

When to trade Break out you have to learn it through experience. I can't give you a pill to become a successful trader. Just follow our trader and post your chart practice more. you will get your reward.

when you trade small tf you have to have pre determinations that if this trade hits stop you will not open any trade you will accept the loss. once you have this in your mind you will not over-trade. you will accept trading results as it is. it is very difficult to lose your account in forex if you have proper mindsets.

Best of luck all

--- 帖子 #888 ---
After hitting my tp price is moving lower. It's waiting time now.

Trend continuation trading and reversal trading are two different approaches to trading in the financial markets. Here's an overview of each approach:Trend Continuation Trading: Trend continuation trading focuses on identifying and capitalizing on an existing trend in the market. Traders who follow this approach believe that the trend will persist and look for opportunities to enter trades in the direction of the prevailing trend. They aim to ride the trend until signs of exhaustion or a reversal occur. Key characteristics of trend continuation trading include:  Identifying a clear trend: Traders look for higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend or lower highs and lower lows in a downtrend. Entry and exit points: Traders typically enter trades after a pullback or a minor consolidation within the trend. They use tools like moving averages, trendlines, or trend channels to identify potential entry and exit points. Risk management: Traders set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and may trail their stop loss as the trend progresses to protect profits. Targeting larger moves: Traders aim for larger profits by holding positions for an extended period until the trend shows signs of weakening or reversing.  Reversal Trading: Reversal trading involves identifying potential reversal points in the market where the trend is expected to change direction. Traders who follow this approach look for signs of exhaustion in the current trend and aim to enter trades at the early stages of a new trend. Key characteristics of reversal trading include:  Spotting trend exhaustion: Traders look for technical signals such as divergences, candlestick patterns, or key support/resistance levels to identify potential trend exhaustion. Entry and exit points: Traders enter trades at the early stages of a potential reversal, often using tighter stop-loss orders to manage risk. They may also use confirmation indicators or additional price action signals to validate the reversal. Quick profits: Reversal traders often target shorter-term profits as they aim to capture the initial move of a new trend. They may exit the trade as the new trend gains momentum or if the market shows signs of invalidating the reversal. Risk management: Traders still employ risk management techniques such as setting stop-loss orders to protect against potential losses. Both approaches have their merits, and the choice between trend continuation trading and reversal trading depends on the trader's preferences, trading style, and market conditions. Some traders may choose to incorporate elements of both approaches, depending on the situation. It's important to conduct thorough analysis, practice, and adapt your strategy based on the market dynamics and your personal trading goals.

we have got our DST buy entry in H4 chart, Now if we enter we will have to use a large stop. to have more efficient entry we have to wait for lower tf pull back for better entry. next we will explain how to trade this trade signal.

H1 chart price close below ema and price move above ema with a momentum, how we can entry buy entry with a small stop with the directions of the h4 signal.

second possible entry if we miss first entry, ema colour change and again change color with the directions of the higher tf entry directions. we will enter and use 1 to 2 RR tp.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
after hitting one trade 1 to 2 RR we will look for pull back entry.

here is a possible entry price close below ema and continue lower and price move above ema. we could entry there at the white line.

we will not entry at a big candle since stop lose would be high. this trade alose hit tp.

study this way a market we will find lots of good signals. yes some times you will make mistake but over all you will get good setups and good RR trade too.

if you studay this dst sell signal you will find 1 to 1 RR trade which is hit BE stop. in H1 pull back entry.

Having a profitable trading system does not guarantee that you will become a profitable trader. Trading involves various factors, including market conditions, risk management, emotional control, and continuous learning and adaptation.

While a profitable trading system is a valuable component, it should be combined with other important aspects of trading. Here are a few factors to consider in addition to having a trading system:Risk Management: Implementing proper risk management techniques is crucial for long-term success. This includes setting appropriate stop-loss levels, managing position sizes, and considering overall portfolio risk. Emotional Control: Emotions can have a significant impact on trading decisions. Developing discipline, patience, and the ability to control emotions such as fear and greed is essential. This can be achieved through self-awareness, practice, and following a well-defined trading plan. Continuous Learning: Markets evolve, and staying informed about market trends, news, and economic events is vital. Continuously educate yourself about different trading strategies, indicators, and market analysis techniques. Regularly review and adapt your trading system based on your experiences and new insights. Backtesting and Analysis: Thoroughly backtest your trading system using historical data to assess its performance. Analyze the results, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make necessary adjustments. Consider forward testing your system on a demo account before trading with real money. Record Keeping and Evaluation: Maintain a trading journal to track your trades and analyze your performance. Review your trades regularly, identify patterns, and assess the effectiveness of your trading system. This helps in identifying areas for improvement and refining your trading approach over time. trading involves inherent risks, and no strategy can guarantee profits in all market conditions. It's essential to be realistic and manage your expectations accordingly. Consistency, discipline, and a continuous learning mindset are key attributes for becoming a successful trader.

EMA100?

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Yes, all my charts have the EMA100.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Entry signals: Look for entry signals that align with the trend. Here are two common entry strategies:

a. Pullback strategy: Wait for the price to pull back to the 100 EMA in an uptrend or bounce off the 100 EMA in a downtrend. Once the price shows signs of a reversal or continuation in the trend direction, consider entering a trade.

b. Breakout strategy: Monitor the price as it approaches the 100 EMA. If the price breaks above the 100 EMA in an uptrend or below the 100 EMA in a downtrend, it may indicate a potential trade opportunity.

I don't use 200 and 100 ema. I use multiple timeframe 10 or 21 ema for direction. But use 100 or 200 ema if it helps.

Title: Developing a Resilient Mindset for Success in Forex Trading

Introduction: In the fast-paced and unpredictable world of forex trading, developing a resilient mindset is crucial for long-term success. The ability to bounce back from setbacks, adapt to changing market conditions, and maintain a positive outlook in the face of challenges is what sets successful traders apart. In this article, we will delve into the significance of developing a resilient mindset in forex trading and provide practical strategies to cultivate resilience, ensuring a path to achievement and fulfillment.Understanding Resilience: Resilience is the ability to recover quickly from difficulties, adapt to challenges, and maintain mental strength in the face of adversity. In forex trading, resilience plays a vital role in navigating losses, market volatility, and unexpected events. By developing resilience, traders can remain focused on their goals and overcome obstacles along the way. Embrace a Growth Mindset: A growth mindset is essential for cultivating resilience. It involves believing in the potential for growth and improvement, even in the face of setbacks. Adopting a growth mindset allows traders to view challenges as opportunities for learning and development. Embrace the belief that skills and abilities can be developed through dedication, practice, and continuous learning. Foster Positive Self-Talk: The power of self-talk cannot be underestimated. Cultivate positive self-talk by reframing negative thoughts, replacing self-doubt with affirmations, and practicing self-compassion. By nurturing a positive internal dialogue, traders can boost confidence, maintain motivation, and reinforce a resilient mindset. Learn from Failure: Failure is an inevitable part of forex trading. Resilient traders embrace failure as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. Analyze and reflect on past failures, extract valuable lessons, and adjust trading strategies accordingly. Failure becomes a stepping stone toward success, reinforcing resilience and growth. Manage Emotions and Stress: Emotional regulation is vital for maintaining a resilient mindset. Emotional intelligence allows traders to identify and manage emotions effectively. Practice techniques such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, and stress reduction strategies to manage emotional responses and reduce the impact of stress on decision-making. Cultivate Adaptive Thinking: Flexibility and adaptability are key characteristics of a resilient mindset. Forex markets are dynamic, and traders must be willing to adapt their strategies to changing conditions. Embrace an open-minded approach, continuously monitor and analyze performance, and make necessary adjustments. Adaptability allows traders to stay ahead of the curve and thrive in ever-changing market environments. Build a Supportive Network: Surround yourself with a supportive network of fellow traders, mentors, or trading communities. Connect with like-minded individuals who understand the challenges of forex trading. Seek guidance, share experiences, and receive feedback. Building a supportive network provides invaluable support and perspective, bolstering resilience and motivation. Prioritize Self-Care: Self-care is essential for maintaining a resilient mindset. Engage in activities outside of trading that promote mental and emotional well-being. Maintain a healthy lifestyle, engage in hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and take breaks from trading when needed. Prioritizing self-care allows for rejuvenation, preventing burnout, and ensuring long-term resilience. Conclusion: Developing a resilient mindset is a vital component of success in forex trading. By embracing a growth mindset, fostering positive self-talk, learning from failures, managing emotions and stress, cultivating adaptive thinking, building a supportive network, and prioritizing self-care, traders can navigate challenges and setbacks with resilience and determination. Remember, resilience is a skill that can be nurtured and strengthened over time. By cultivating a resilient mindset, traders can not only achieve their goals but also find fulfillment in the journey of forex trading.

Hello hasib You opened a very good thread. I found a lot of good things. Thanks a lot for this.

Here in this order you made, you may have missed the thick support line. Unfortunately, the price reversed on the line, before the take profit was reached. Later the stop loss was reached. Don't you want to work with resistance and support lines?

It's on my chart but it was far away from the setup. How do you use it?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
First of all, we know what kind of market conditions our system does very very well that is the trending market.

here is an example of trending conditions.

I use Daily, weekly, and monthly open lines for Trade directions. if the price is above the daily open line it is my general view that day is a bullish day like wise weekly and monthly. If the price is too far way from the daily open line I don't open trade.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Hello pusztafie!

Can you please comment your logic of this trade based on your indicators?

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Willingly! It was a range trade. Indicators in this case do not have much importance. Much more for the green rectangles delimiting the range. I entered trading at about 10-15% of the inner band, SL was a few pips above the upper band, TP was at the top of the lower band.

Trading major pairs has its advantages like the spread is low. Trend or Breakout trading those pair is not the best way. To Trade EurUsd, GbpUsd here are some ideas I generated from ChatGPT-

Certainly, here's a more detailed step-by-step outline of a Bollinger Bands mean reversion strategy:
Strategy Setup:Timeframe: 30-minute chart Currency Pairs: GBP/USD and EUR/USD Bollinger Bands Parameters: 100-period SMA, 2 standard deviations Entry Rules:Overbought Condition:Wait for the price to cross above the upper Bollinger Band. Confirm the overbought condition with other indicators or price patterns if possible. Consider waiting for a candlestick pattern that indicates potential reversal, such as a shooting star or bearish engulfing.  Oversold Condition:Wait for the price to cross below the lower Bollinger Band. Confirm the oversold condition with other indicators or price patterns if possible. Consider waiting for a candlestick pattern that indicates potential reversal, such as a hammer or bullish engulfing.  Exit Rules:Take Profit:Set the take profit level at the middle Bollinger Band (the 100-period SMA line). Alternatively, you can set a profit target based on previous support/resistance levels or other technical analysis tools.  Stop Loss:Set a stop loss to limit potential losses. You can place the stop loss below/above the entry candle or the swing low/high preceding the entry.  Risk Management:Position Sizing:Determine your position size based on your account balance and risk tolerance. A common rule is to risk a certain percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of your account balance on each trade.  Risk-Reward Ratio:Aim for a risk-reward ratio that ensures potential profits are larger than potential losses (e.g., 1:2 or higher).  Additional Considerations:Confirmation:Use additional technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) or fundamental analysis to confirm the signals generated by the Bollinger Bands. Avoid solely relying on one indicator for trading decisions.  News and Events:Be aware of upcoming news releases and economic events that could impact the currency pairs' movements. Consider avoiding trading during high-impact news releases.  Backtesting and Optimization:Backtest the strategy using historical data to assess its performance over different market conditions. Consider optimizing the strategy parameters based on the results of the backtesting.  Paper Trading:Before using real money, practice the strategy in a simulated or demo trading environment to gain experience and confidence.  Remember that no trading strategy is foolproof, and there's always a risk of losses. Proper risk management, continuous learning, and adapting to changing market conditions are crucial aspects of successful trading.

Curious to get an opinion on what type of MA can be a fairly consistent baseline according to anyone who comes across interested to discuss? I had been following some youtube videos- and most traders imply that they have some combination of MA on their chart to anticipate a trade.

So we will look for H4 ema rejections to bounce back towards the downside with CS signal everything works as confluence to sell.

Why not trade price when far away from EMA because there is a chance to market move up and hit sl and go down again.

Understanding price action and order flow from a clean chart and using the 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) can be a valuable approach in Forex trading. Here's a guide on how to do this:

1. **Clean Chart Setup:**

- Start with a clean chart with no additional indicators or clutter. ( I use triple super trend indicator and color ema, what I use you will see above chart)

- Choose a currency pair and a specific timeframe (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, or daily) based on your trading style and preferences.

2. **21 EMA:**

- Add the 21 EMA to your chart. This moving average will help you identify the trend and potential levels of support and resistance.

3. **Trend Identification:**

- Observe the slope and positioning of the 21 EMA on the chart.

- If the 21 EMA is sloping upward and prices are trading above it, it suggests an uptrend.

- If the 21 EMA is sloping downward and prices are below it, it indicates a downtrend.

4. **Order Flow Analysis:**

- Pay attention to price action around the 21 EMA. Look for key price interactions:

- **Bounces:** When prices touch or approach the 21 EMA and then reverse direction, it can indicate that this EMA is acting as a dynamic support or resistance level.

- **Breaks:** If prices decisively break above the 21 EMA in an uptrend or below it in a downtrend, it can signify a potential change in the order flow and trend direction.

- **Rejections:** Watch for price rejections or long wicks near the 21 EMA, which may signal a struggle between buyers and sellers at that level.

5. **Candlestick Patterns:**

- Use candlestick patterns in conjunction with the 21 EMA to help confirm your analysis. For example, bullish reversal patterns near the 21 EMA in an uptrend may indicate a potential buying opportunity.

6. **Support and Resistance:**

- Identify other significant support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels can complement your analysis by providing additional context for potential trade setups.

7. **Confirmation and Entry:**

- Wait for confirmation before entering a trade. This could be in the form of a candlestick pattern, a break of a significant level, or a price rejection near the 21 EMA.

- Set stop-loss and take-profit levels based on your risk management plan.

8. **Risk Management:**

- Always use proper risk management techniques, including setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and adhering to a risk-reward ratio that makes sense for your trading strategy.

9. **Continuous Learning:**

- Continuously study and learn from your trades and chart analysis. Over time, you'll develop a better understanding of how price action and order flow interact with the 21 EMA on your chosen timeframe.

10. **Practice and Patience:**

- Practice your analysis on historical charts and in a demo trading environment to gain confidence.

- Be patient and disciplined in your trading. Not every setup will result in a profitable trade.

Remember that trading involves risks, and no strategy guarantees success. It's essential to adapt your analysis to current market conditions and to manage your risk effectively. Additionally, consider using a trading journal to track your trades and learn from your experiences.

Understanding impulsive and corrective price movements in Forex trading is crucial for identifying potential trading opportunities and improving decision-making. Impulsive moves are typically associated with trend continuation, while corrective moves are often part of trend retracements or reversals. Here's how to distinguish between them:

**Impulsive Moves:**

1. **Characteristics:**

- Impulsive moves are strong and directional price movements that often occur swiftly.

- They are characterized by large, consecutive candlesticks or bars moving in the same direction.

- Impulsive moves are driven by strong market sentiment and participation.

2. **Key Signs:**

- Sharp price increases (bullish impulsive) or sharp declines (bearish impulsive) with little retracement.

- Volume tends to be higher during impulsive moves, indicating increased market activity.

3. **Identifying Factors:**

- Look for a series of higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend (bullish impulsive) or lower highs and lower lows in a downtrend (bearish impulsive).

- The presence of strong news events or fundamental factors can often trigger impulsive moves.

4. **Trading Strategies:**

- In an impulsive move, traders often seek to join the trend by entering positions in the direction of the move.

- Entry points can be identified using various technical tools, such as breakouts, moving averages, or trendlines.

**Corrective Moves:**

1. **Characteristics:**

- Corrective moves are price retracements or consolidations within an existing trend.

- They tend to be slower and less aggressive than impulsive moves.

- Corrective moves are often marked by price range-bound trading or smaller candlesticks.

2. **Key Signs:**

- Prices move against the prevailing trend but typically within a defined range.

- Volume tends to be lower during corrective moves compared to impulsive moves.

3. **Identifying Factors:**

- Look for a series of lower highs and lower lows within an uptrend (bullish correction) or higher highs and higher lows within a downtrend (bearish correction).

- Corrective moves can be caused by profit-taking, minor retracements, or temporary shifts in sentiment.

4. **Trading Strategies:**

- Traders may use corrective moves as opportunities to enter or add to positions in the direction of the overall trend.

- trendline breaks, or reversal candlestick patterns can assist in identifying potential entry points during corrections.

In practice, impulsive and corrective moves often alternate within a trending market. Recognizing the distinction between them can help traders make informed decisions about when to enter, exit, or manage their positions. Combining technical analysis with an understanding of market sentiment and fundamental factors can enhance your ability to interpret price action accurately and trade more effectively in the Forex market.

"Mastering Precision in Forex Trading: The Advantages of Pending Orders Over Market Orders"

Using pending orders instead of market orders in forex trading offers several advantages, depending on the trader's strategy and risk management preferences. Here are some key advantages:

1. **Precision and Control:**

- **Entry Price Control:** With pending orders, traders can specify the exact price at which they want to enter the market. This allows for precise entry points and reduces the risk of slippage, which can occur with market orders during periods of high volatility.

2. **Predefined Risk Management:**

- **Stop Loss and Take Profit:** Traders can set predefined stop-loss and take-profit levels when placing pending orders. This helps in implementing a structured risk management strategy, ensuring that potential losses are limited and profits are taken at desired levels.

3. **Automation and Flexibility:**

- **Automated Execution:** Pending orders can be used to automate trading strategies. Traders can set conditions for entry, exit, and risk management in advance, allowing for more flexibility and the ability to participate in the market even when away from the computer.

4. **Avoid Emotional Decision-Making:**

- **Reduced Impulsivity:** Using pending orders helps traders avoid impulsive decisions based on emotions. By predefining entry and exit points, traders can stick to their original plan and avoid making decisions in the heat of the moment.

5. **Protection During News Events:**

- **Protection Against News Volatility:** Market orders can be vulnerable to price spikes and increased volatility during news releases. Pending orders allow traders to set up positions away from the current market price, providing a level of protection during unpredictable events.

6. **Range-Bound Strategies:**

- **Range Trading:** Traders using range-bound strategies can benefit from pending orders by placing them at key support or resistance levels. This allows them to capitalize on price reversals when the market reaches predetermined levels.

7. **Time Management:**

- **Time-Activated Orders:** Traders can use pending orders with time conditions, such as "Good 'til Cancelled" (GTC) or "Good 'til Time" (GTT). This helps in better time management and allows for planning trades over extended periods.

While pending orders offer these advantages, it's important for traders to consider market conditions and be aware that there are also potential risks involved, such as the order not getting filled if the specified price is not reached. It's crucial to thoroughly understand the mechanics of pending orders and to use them in conjunction with a well-thought-out trading strategy.

Yesterday, the low taken-out price started to move higher from the Daily open line.

As long as the price is not closing below daily open line it is a valid long trade.

74.44 is the first target

10 EMA Example Trade Setup

GBP/JPY4-hour Chart: Price is above the 10 EMA (uptrend). 1-hour Chart: Price retraces to the 10 EMA and forms a bullish engulfing pattern. Entry: Enter a long position at the close of the bullish engulfing candle. Stop Loss: Place it below the recent swing low on the 1-hour chart. Take Profit: Set a take profit at 1.5 to 2 times the risk or trail the stop loss below the 10 EMA on the 1-hour chart. Oil4-hour Chart: Price is below the 10 EMA (downtrend). 1-hour Chart: Price retraces to the 10 EMA and forms a bearish engulfing pattern. Entry: Enter a short position at the close of the bearish engulfing candle. Stop Loss: Place it above the recent swing high on the 1-hour chart. Take Profit: Set a take profit at 1.5 to 2 times the risk or trail the stop loss above the 10 EMA on the 1-hour chart. By following this strategy, traders can align their trades with the prevailing market trend, optimize their entries and exits, and manage risk effectively.

Risk Management Plan (One to two setups a day)Position Sizing:Risk no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on any single trade.

Stop Loss:For long positions, place the stop loss below the most recent swing low on the H1 chart. For short positions, place the stop loss above the most recent swing high on the H1 chart. Ensure the stop loss is within your risk tolerance level.

Take Profit:Set a take profit target at least 1.5 to 2 times the distance of your stop loss (Risk:Reward ratio of 1:1.5 or 1:2). Alternatively, use significant support/resistance levels or round numbers to set take profit.

Trailing Stop Loss:For long positions, trail the stop loss below the 10 EMA on the H1 chart as the price moves in your favor. For short positions, trail the stop loss above the 10 EMA on the H1 chart as the price moves in your favor.

Combining the 50-period EMA with the Triple Super Trend strategy can be an effective approach to forex trading, providing clear signals for trend direction and potential entry and exit points. Here’s an outline of how this combined strategy can be used:

Strategy Overview50-Period EMA:Trend Identification: The 50-period EMA helps identify the overall trend. If the price is above the EMA, it indicates an uptrend. If the price is below the EMA, it indicates a downtrend.  Triple Super Trend:Multiple Super Trend Indicators: Use three Super Trend indicators with different ATR (Average True Range) multipliers and periods to confirm the trend and potential reversal points. For instance, you might use settings like (ATR period: 10, multiplier: 3), (ATR period: 14, multiplier: 4), and (ATR period: 20, multiplier: 5).  Entry and Exit RulesLong Entry:Price is above the 50-period EMA. All three Super Trend indicators show a bullish signal (typically indicated by the Super Trend line being below the price).  Short Entry:Price is below the 50-period EMA. All three Super Trend indicators show a bearish signal (typically indicated by the Super Trend line being above the price).  Exit Rules:Exit the trade when any of the Super Trend indicators flip to the opposite signal. Alternatively, set a fixed risk-reward ratio for profit-taking and stop-loss.  Win Rate Probability and Risk-Reward Ratio

The win rate probability and risk-reward ratio can vary significantly based on market conditions, currency pairs, and the specific settings used for the Super Trend indicators. However, here are some general insights:Win Rate Probability:Typically, a well-optimized trend-following strategy like this one might have a win rate ranging from 50% to 70%. However, this is highly dependent on the market conditions and the trader's ability to stick to the rules without emotional interference.  Risk-Reward Ratio:A common risk-reward ratio for this strategy could be 1:2 or 1:3. This means that for every dollar risked, the potential reward should be two or three dollars. For instance, if you set your stop-loss 50 pips away from your entry point, you should aim for a profit target of 100 to 150 pips.  Example ScenarioLong Trade Example:Entry: Price is above the 50 EMA, and all three Super Trend indicators show a bullish signal. Stop-Loss: Set 50 pips below the entry point. Take-Profit: Set 100 to 150 pips above the entry point. Expected Outcome: With a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, even if only 50% of the trades are winners, you can still be profitable.  Short Trade Example:Entry: Price is below the 50 EMA, and all three Super Trend indicators show a bearish signal. Stop-Loss: Set 50 pips above the entry point. Take-Profit: Set 100 to 150 pips below the entry point. Expected Outcome: With a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, even if only 50% of the trades are winners, you can still be profitable.  Conclusion

The combination of the 50-period EMA and the Triple Super Trend strategy can provide clear signals for forex trading, potentially leading to profitable trades. However, it's essential to backtest the strategy on historical data and tweak the parameters according to the specific currency pairs and time frames you are trading. Additionally, maintain disciplined risk management practices to ensure long-term success.

For optimizing the 50-period EMA and Triple Super Trend strategy specifically for the GBP/JPY H1 chart, let's tweak the settings to suit the volatility and characteristics of this currency pair.

Suggested Settings

50-Period EMAPurpose: Identify the overall trend direction. Setting: 50-period EMA remains the same. Triple Super Trend Settings

Using three Super Trend indicators with different ATR periods and multipliers helps capture short-term, medium-term, and long-term trends.Short-Term Super Trend:ATR Period: 10 Multiplier: 2  Medium-Term Super Trend:ATR Period: 14 Multiplier: 3  Long-Term Super Trend:ATR Period: 20 Multiplier: 4  Entry and Exit Rules

Long EntryPrice is above the 50-period EMA. All three Super Trend indicators show a bullish signal. Short EntryPrice is below the 50-period EMA. All three Super Trend indicators show a bearish signal. Exit RulesExit the trade when any of the Super Trend indicators flip to the opposite signal. Alternatively, set a fixed risk-reward ratio for profit-taking and stop-loss. Example Scenario for GBP/JPY H1 Chart

Long Trade ExampleEntry: Price is above the 50 EMA, and all three Super Trend indicators show a bullish signal. Stop-Loss: Set 50 pips below the entry point (can be adjusted based on recent swing lows). Take-Profit: Set 100 to 150 pips above the entry point (can be adjusted based on recent swing highs). Short Trade ExampleEntry: Price is below the 50 EMA, and all three Super Trend indicators show a bearish signal. Stop-Loss: Set 50 pips above the entry point (can be adjusted based on recent swing highs). Take-Profit: Set 100 to 150 pips below the entry point (can be adjusted based on recent swing lows). Backtesting and Optimization

Before using this strategy live, it’s essential to backtest it on historical data to ensure its effectiveness and tweak the parameters if needed. Here’s how you can approach backtesting:Historical Data: Use at least six months to a year of historical data for GBP/JPY on the H1 chart. Entry and Exit Conditions: Apply the entry and exit rules to the historical data. Performance Metrics: Track key performance metrics such as win rate, average profit/loss per trade, maximum drawdown, and overall profitability. Risk ManagementPosition Sizing: Ensure you’re not risking more than 1-2% of your trading capital on a single trade. Stop-Loss and Take-Profit: Stick to the defined stop-loss and take-profit levels to maintain a favorable risk-reward ratio. Example Backtest Results (Hypothetical)Win Rate: 55% Average Risk-Reward Ratio: 1:2 Net Profit: Positive after accounting for transaction costs and slippage. Conclusion

By using the suggested settings for the Triple Super Trend indicators and combining them with the 50-period EMA, you can potentially create a robust trading strategy for the GBP/JPY H1 chart. Remember, continuous monitoring and adjustment based on market conditions are key to maintaining the strategy's effectiveness. Always start with backtesting and paper trading before going live.

Exit RulesExit the trade when any of the Super Trend indicators flip to the opposite signal. Alternatively, set a fixed risk-reward ratio for profit-taking and stop-loss.

Long Trade ExampleEntry: Price is above the 50 EMA, and all three Super Trend indicators show a bullish signal. Stop-Loss: Set 50-70 pips below the entry point (based on recent swing lows).

Stop-Loss: Set 50-70 pips above the entry point (based on recent swing highs). Take-Profit: Set 100-150 pips below the entry point (based on recent swing lows). Backtesting and Optimization

Before using this strategy live, backtesting it on historical data is crucial. Here’s how you can proceed:Historical Data: Use at least six months to a year of historical data for USOIL on the H1 chart.

@hasib and @pusztafie - let's go guys!!

Also have GU longs on, targeting the previous daily high.

If the high is not taken before news today then news should weaken USD.

If high gets taken then could be a pullback before further weakening of USD.

Position now at breakeven because it has come to a H4 ignored demand. The inefficient move down ignored demand which could cause a pullback so it's at B/E.

For anyone posting here if we all focus on HTF bias then we can see how everyone views the HTF and what bias is used for which trade and learn together.

If people can give a quick explanation of what they see on HTF then that would be beneficial to all!

More eyes on the market the better and we can all learn from each other. It's not so much about being right and wrong but just seeing what HTF things people look for. The more that post the better.

My entry is always a touch to a zone as you can see but entry can be anything, it doesn't really matter but HTF bias is key.

Looking at Daily there is no signs for sells so just looking for buy.

M30 shows engulf up LN open but didn't look convincing to me so I waited.

Next candle engulfed down but I wasn't looking for shorts.

Then I saw an engulf back up and entered.

Small daily range so no real need to wait for any better entry.

I like this patterns which I call failed engulf. Engulf in one direction then engulf back the other direction.

Update:

This one hit TP

FOMC minutes later today so I will just finish now.

--- 帖子 #1406 ---
EJ - SL

This one didn't work. I was a little unlucky as it came close to TP but main thing is I shouldn't have gone against a daily candle.

Weekly + H4 looked decent but not daily. All must align to be high probability.

Rookie error!

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
I just use alerts bro. I follow around 20+ markets. Just set alerts when it makes new high or low and if it looks interesting then focus on it otherwise not.

The way I see it is we have a lot of markets and can pick the ones that look best. Problem with narrowing focus too much is sometimes nothing interesting is happening on the ones we focus on but on another market there are some very key opps.

Everything I do starts on the HTF so if there is nothing interesting on the HTF then I don't even set any alerts on that pair.

But as with anything in trading, just do what works for you! No right or wrong, as long as you are making pips.

Brave entry after all those wicks but glad it worked for you!

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
if we look at daily chart it is with the range of one candle, the price did not break high so it is a ranging market. so I took trade when the price rejected the weekly open line and waited for the price to move close so that I could use a small stop. if we look at both charts it will be more clear.

The stop was around 30 pips, I was ready to lose that trade.

--- 帖子 #1411 ---
that makes a lot more sense, thanks for explanation. If we could all add HTF context to trades it would be good. I try and add HTF context to all my trades. The more we do this the better we can all learn.

No trades yesterday. I had GU but closed it before news as wasn't feeling very good about it but it would have won. Perhaps should have just left it.

Today is a textbook setup according to the strat of this thread. Again GU.

Monthly: HIGHLY bullish

Weekly: HIGHLY bullish

Daily: Pause candle yesterday with a slight pullback which make longs today highly likely.

The key here is the weekly candle and the proximity to the monthly/weekly highs.

When zoomed out it seems obvious that price is heading for Weekly/Monthly high to the left. Once that level is touched, I will look for short term shorts as a pullback is due.

Entry was a little late unfortunately but still decent. If this gets stopped out, I will just look for re-entries. First M15 bullish candle was the perfect entry IMO.

Update: TP Hit!
This was a VERY strong trade.

--- 帖子 #1414 ---
EA

Was waiting to see what price would do at H4 demand. After the initial reaction it engulfed back down signalling shorts.

Entry on M5 when it came back to supply. Once price shifted the zone down I moved the SL to the high which should hold.

Very little risk left on the trade.

Monthly: Big wick after taking major LQ.

Weekly: pushing down

Daily: Although we are pushing up the rest of the timeframes signal shorts so this is just a retrace.

H4: The key here was the H4 Engulf down. It could just be coming to H4 demand (which can't be seen on my post but it's one more candle to the left on H4) but unlikely after the engulf.

@Hasib and @pusztafie - let's post explanations like this with our trades.

XAUUSD

Monthly: Bullish

Weekly: Engulf Up - bullish

Daily: We do have an engulf down but looks more like a retrace

H4: Engulf Up

Basically we are up and I don't see signs of shorts.

We can see break and re-test and engulf confirm for longs.

Also very nice retrace into the wave and engulf up.

Let's see.

TP was adjusted slightly as it was higher than my 1.5R I go for.

Hasib, what program do you use to save and edit the images. My program is pretty rudimentary.

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
GU

All the same as before.

It seems price needed a pullback after taking the previous daily high, got lucky my TP got hit on previous trade.

That engulf down looked fake on M15 to me. Took a little risky entry but I still maintain that weekly/monthly level "should" get taken before any shorts come into play.

Original SL was below that wick down but I've moved it slightly. Normally not something I do but will watch that low and close the trade accordingly if it comes back in a way I don't like.

Very good momentum so no need to overthink this too much. It either will work or not and time of day is perfect with fake engulf as well if I'm correct.

Update:
Closed Position around original SL  Looks like the move I'm looking for will happen next week or maybe after news but I'm out and no re-entry for today as if it does go up then it's a very messy move and best to stay out.

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
Got unlucky on this one as news completed the move I was looking for but such is trading. Range was limited so couldn't use a larger SL. Good thing is the move up is completed this week so now I will look for some signs for a short term pullback early next week as major liquidity has been taken.

Overall great week in the markets. Have a nice weekend guys!

Ah okay thanks, I'm not too familiar with your setup so was just asking. thanks

I'll check it out thanks.

I briefly watched that other video you sent and was actually really good. As you said, I also don't trade like that but he has some interesting concepts that are worth noting as he has gone deep into FVGs. Thanks for sharing the link.

I actually don't watch any trading related material anymore, unless someone recommends me something. I just read these forums every now and then for any interesting concepts. This forum always has new ways of seeing the market so it's interesting. The engulf/failed engulf thread where they trade gold is an interesting one IMO.

Thank you.

As you know I trade supply and demand I love Sup/Dem that are fresh that have wicks above/below it. These are killer setups.

When watching the vids from that guy it seems that this same concept can be applied to FVG which is something I currently don't monitor so will start.

Thank you for all the vids, appreciate you sharing the links!

Here's one from Friday. The main thing to note is H4 is up and we have come to fresh demand.

Entry was on first M30 push up, very simple

I follow reactions to wicks a lot. This is one of the main things I look for. Reaction to HTF wicks.

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
No trades yesterday as was a holiday here.

Looking at M30 there was a major consolidation yesterday after a substantial move up.

The key was price didn't reject that weekly level I was targeting on Friday but engulfed it.

Now there is a high chance of price coming back to that weekly level (which is my trade) and can see my TP is a little above the weekly level.

ALL timeframes seem bullish and we could still spike up for some more liquidity but I think my SL "should" hold which is why I entered where I have as it gave me the R:R to put my SL there and get my TP before the weekly high.

Entry was just on price leaving a wick.

This trade is a little unusual to my other trades but it seems high probability to me.

Update: SL

I thought the wicks looked good rejecting the upper end of the consolidation but just looks like going against the momentum wasn't a good idea.

the range down to the weekly high still looks good to me but need a clear change in structure now to be able to take it. Will monitor it.

--- 帖子 #1461 ---
Small scalp here EJ. All happened too fast to post live.

Just targeting that lower zone. Put to breakeven pretty fast and it hit TP.

--- 帖子 #1462 ---
GU - secondary entry. Have taken some risk off but will take more off soon. If I get a breakeven or slight loss, then will look for another entry tomorrow now. It seems one last push up was due but it didn't seem obvious to me in the morning. Am looking for a high momentum move down with no deep pullbacks.

The TP on this is big at around 1.30525. I see this as the range down so if I don't manage to catch the whole move today I will look for more opps tomorrow. This will be the last entry for today.

Reason for entry is that demand didn't hold then almost entered on the doji but decided to wait for another candle and saw the rejection candle down. Waited a little more for entry.

Update: this is now at B/E
Update: This ended B/E.
Momentum is strongly up therefore these kinds of trades are risky in nature and as this is the second entry I didn't want to hold risk on this trade.
If I don't see any obvious signs of sells tomorrow will focus again on buys. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
EU

This one is risky but I thought an entry was reasonable here. Have already taken risk off and the range is down to that low I have marked out and after that I was planning on putting to B/E but good chance of a wick to my entry so will carefully watch on M5 if/when it comes back to my entry and close accordingly. The range I saw was to the low but sometimes it just goes without retracing, so worth entering. Will be watching this one very carefully as once that low is taken, I'm not confident how much lower it can come.

Update: This is now at B/E
Update: This trade ended Breakeven.

GU

My second trade on GU yesterday on reflection wasn't a good trade even though it ended B/E. First trade I still think was okay. However once structure clearly shifted up the focus should have been on longs so that was an error. However today it seems clear for longs. Let's see.

Update - SL

Was a little surprised it came down so fast but will have to wait and see what happens next now. I don't see any signs of shorts yet so will continue to look for longs.

There is a possibility that yesterday was the last push up before a daily engulf down but need to see signs of that first.

Update - SL

Tough start to the week am now net negative on the week. Will see how this plays out to see if I missed anything. My thinking was a retrace to that fresh daily wick was highly probable at the very least but didn't work out.

I think you should develop currency pair knowledge before trading a pair, You need to know the time too.

Just trading random pairs will not work with any strategy. one strategy won't work in all markets.

when you see the price is moving from range to range why do you expect the price will start to continue to trend?

Anyway your trading career, is your decision.

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
Thanks, I try and follow GU and XAUUSD more closely but the rest I just follow with alerts.

Last week was pretty epic for me so will see over the longer term if this method works or not but so far it's producing results most weeks. Some weeks things are just more clear than others. I prefer following more pairs as can pick and chose the ones that the HTF looks good.

GU is bullish but looks like the HTF PB I was looking for yesterday is happening today.

Everyday can't be wins, sometimes the drawdowns come but important thing is long term performance.

I am posting trades live here......

EC Shorts.

Just looked very obvious looking at structure and H4 pause candle.

Have only 2 pips risk on this at this stage. Will end close to B/E if it comes back above the wick I entered on.

Update - Full B/E at this stage.
Update - TP Hit  (Back to breakeven for the week, now looking to actually make something!)

--- 帖子 #1475 ---
Can see the move I was looking for completed today. The analysis was correct just the timing a little off. There was one more daily consolidation before the move but it looked to me, yesterday, like it was good to go. Was going to look for a re-entry but all happened during Asia.

--- 帖子 #1476 ---
GU Shorts

Very clean range but I waited for news to hit before entering as big news so can get big spikes and I don't trade generally before news.

H4 engulf confirmed direction. I entered after the first M5 candle with a big wick going for the wick fill down.

This whole range down was the range I was looking for on Tuesday but I was one day early. Price should now get to the weekly wick today as we have cleared daily demand.

Update - B/E
Update - TP  (Am glad this came before news in 30 mins as otherwise would have to think about another spike up and maybe loosen SL)
In this case the M1 zone hold as I thought it would.

--- 帖子 #1477 ---
@Hasib - you see bro? Yesterday's GU trade was HTF changing structure which is always tricky. It was particularly tricky as daily push was very strong before the turn. These situations always catch me out but they are not very common. Normally we have wick on daily then have signs of turn.

I was really expecting the retrace to happen on tuesday as was seeing signs but it needed one last push which is something I'm going to learn from.

AC was just unlucky as analysis was 100% correct just it consolidated for one more day. Again I can't control that. Losses always come and sometimes come together but today 2/2 erasing the losses of yesterday. Results of any one day is just random.

Also I missed one trade on Gold which I was watching but there was a problem with my alerts otherwise would have been 3/3 today.

Next Up UC

Update - I have closed this at breakeven. I don't like the length of consolidation and pushes to the downside.

News may complete the move here but will look for scalps after news. At the moment it's not moving the way I like to see it.

--- 帖子 #1482 ---
Next Up GJ.

News activated PO and SL moved to the high created by news. If this trade is going to work, then that high should hold. TP is the full range down.

I usually go for 1.5R ranges but this is a 5R trade.

Reason for trade is we are in a range and I'm just playing it from one side of the range to the other.

@Hasib these kind of supply zones are my favourite. Lots of wicks below it and a high momentum move into the zone.

Let's see what happens......

Update: This is at B/E
Update: This ended B/E. Should have just gone for 1.5R but I thought this might be the last LQ grab for the move down, especially how quick price fell after entry, so held.

Looks like I dodged a bullet here.... May still go up, will keep an eye on it.

Next Up - gold M5 scalping. Rejection of M5 zone was entry.

It's close to TP now so have put to B/E. Looking to trade momentum here.

EJ - Swing

Forgot I has this one as well. Again same thing. Supply with lots of wicks just below it and big move into the zone.

Consolidation on daily better with GJ but the thing about these premium entries is that can move to B/E very fast. Well worth taking IMO.

Will move SL to B/E.

Update - this one finished at B/E .
There was enough range for 1.5R but these premium entries I usually go for around 5R.

Hi Hasib,

Thanks for sharing!

I noticed in the 2013 version that you shared, the screenshots and examples were mainly on the daily chart.

Was the daily chart the timeframe that you traded on by that time?

And in recent years the trades you shared were 15M charts.

Could you explain why you switched to 15M from daily charts? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1582 ---

--- 帖子 #1583 ---
Almost all of my indicators are not free, so I can't share them. And what is free is already shared here.

I check chart structure and check higher time frame how it goes together. Mostly just follow market direction.

Morning puzstafie,

Thank you for your DTS system may we ask you how we can obtain the Currency Strength meter that you use on your charts.

I realize that we need to attach a time frame to the CSM, just want to keep it simple but have an option to include other time frames without having a Multiframe one

Hope you have a nice weekend, Thank you

Comprehensive Update for the DTS (Day Trade Setups) Trading Strategy

Hello traders,

I’m excited to share the latest iteration of the DTS (Day Trade Setups) Trading Strategy, now incorporating advanced indicators and refined analysis techniques to deliver even more accurate and reliable trading signals. This update is designed for traders looking to achieve consistent results through a structured and multi-layered approach.
Indicators Used in the Strategy4-Timeframe Sidus IndicatorThis indicator combines signals from four different timeframes to provide a comprehensive view of the market trend. It ensures higher accuracy by aligning multi-timeframe trends for precise entries and exits.
Super Smoothed Averages Trend (MA)A specially calibrated moving average to filter market noise and identify smooth, reliable trends. It helps in defining clear trend directions and potential reversal points.
Trend Direction Force IndexA momentum-based indicator that evaluates the strength and direction of the prevailing trend. Assists in confirming trade setups by gauging the market's current force.
Donchian ChannelsHighlights the highest high and lowest low over a specific period to define breakout and reversal zones. Essential for identifying price consolidations, breakout opportunities, and key support/resistance levels.
Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Open LinesThese levels act as psychological price barriers and provide key reference points for intraday and swing trading. Traders can use them to anticipate potential price reactions at these levels and plan their trades accordingly.
Multi-Timeframe Confluence: Ensures that trades align with both intraday and higher timeframe trends. Noise Reduction: The Super Smoothed MA filters unnecessary price fluctuations, keeping signals clear and actionable. Sideways Market Filtering: The Multiple Donchian Channels help identify consolidation periods and avoid false signals, improving overall win rate. Market Conditions Understanding: By analyzing the interaction with Donchian Channels, traders gain better insight into whether the market is trending or ranging. Key Price Levels: The use of open lines adds a layer of precision to identify high-probability trade setups. Stop-Loss Management: Incorporating Donchian Channel bands for stop-loss placement and trailing ensures that risk is controlled dynamically, adapting to market behavior.
Example Chart

The attached chart demonstrates how these indicators come together seamlessly on the XAUUSD H4 timeframe, providing clear entry, exit, and stop-loss levels.

I’d love to hear your feedback on this strategy and how it performs for you in live market conditions. Feel free to ask questions or share your results Let’s continue to refine and improve together!

Happy trading,

Hasib

You don't need the 2025 update. It's enough to read the first 15 pages of this thread, add 2 moving averages, and start trading. Initially, this thread was interesting: there were minimal indicators and a logical trading approach. Now it has turned into a heap of unnecessary indicators. Look for simple and logical systems with minimal indicators — they exist on the forum. Or trade this system, but with just two indicators. I'm no longer interested in this topic. Wishing everyone success!

I understand that some traders prefer using the Heiken Ashi indicator and Heiken Ashi-based systems for their trading strategies. The appeal is clear—they provide smoother price action, reduce noise, and help traders identify trends more visually. Additionally, these systems often aim for small stop-loss levels and high reward-to-risk ratios, which is a reasonable goal in trading.

However, I would like to suggest an alternative approach that I have found effective: using the 10 and 3 EMA crossover strategy for entry signals.
Why I Recommend 10 and 3 EMA Over Heiken AshiSensitivity to Price Movement:

While Heiken Ashi averages the price and smoothens the candles, this can sometimes result in a lagging effect. In contrast, the 10 and 3 EMA crossover is much more sensitive to real-time price movement, allowing for quicker entries and exits, especially in fast-moving markets. Dynamic Support and Resistance:

EMAs can act as dynamic support and resistance levels during trending markets. Watching how price interacts with the 10 EMA, for instance, can give clues about pullbacks and trend continuation. Improved Entry Timing:

By using a fast EMA (3 EMA) and a slower EMA (10 EMA), you can pinpoint entry opportunities with greater precision. This system allows you to catch trends early and reduce the lag associated with Heiken Ashi. Adaptability Across Time Frames:

The 10 and 3 EMA strategy works well across multiple time frames, making it versatile for scalping, day trading, and swing trading. You can analyze the trend on higher time frames (e.g., 4-hour or daily) and time your entries on lower time frames (e.g., 15-minute or 1-hour charts). Clear Trend Reversals:

A crossover between the 3 EMA and 10 EMA often signals a potential trend reversal or continuation. This clarity can provide traders with confidence to enter or exit trades without overcomplicating their decision-making process. Additional Tips for Trading SuccessCombine with a Momentum Indicator: Pairing the 10 and 3 EMA strategy with an indicator like the WAE can improve your accuracy. These indicators can confirm whether the momentum supports your trade direction. Use Multi-Time Frame Analysis: Always check the higher time frame to ensure you're trading in the direction of the dominant trend. For example, if the 4-hour chart shows a strong uptrend, focus on long entries on the 15-minute or 1-hour chart. Risk Management Is Key: No matter how good a strategy is, proper risk management is essential. Aim for a risk-to-reward ratio of at least 1:2, and avoid risking more than 1-2% of your account on a single trade. Backtest and Optimize: Before implementing any strategy, backtest it thoroughly on historical data. This will give you confidence in your system and help you refine its parameters for the asset and time frame you're trading. Final Thoughts

While Heiken Ashi systems have their place and can be useful for certain trading styles, I believe the 10 and 3 EMA crossover strategy offers a more precise and adaptable approach for traders looking to capture trends while keeping stop-loss levels tight and maximizing rewards. It provides a balance of simplicity and effectiveness, without being overly sensitive to market noise.

Trading is all about finding a system that suits your style and goals, so I encourage everyone to experiment, backtest, and see what works best for them. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask—I’m happy to help!

Thank you for your update

Ive been scrolling through this thread. Ive noticed you have multiple different layouts it seems. Not sure on which one is recommended now for this trading method?

Ive been currently following along the old thread of TMS and TMS(R), but as i notice that the dates are a while back and it seems this market and this amazing website evolves rather quickly. Ive def' taken a liking to this method during my readings and just would like to grasp the current Method being used by yourself.

For instance on previous posts;

1. you had a Dashboard stating the trend up or down of the pair on different time frames posted on the top left.

2. There is an updated 2025 version that precedes a post stating; Its not needed and a picture posted on that reply shows a different setup than in previous posts. Im rather confused on what to follow and work towards.

3. I am in no means assuming i will get this method right the first time. It just seems like it clicks and i like that, Some of the other methods ive read through dont seem to click as well as this one has. But even with that "Click" im still completely confused as to which screenshoted template is the current ideal setup.

Sorry if all of this has been covered before. I AM A NEWB, I LOSE TRADES.. for now.

Thanks for your time, effort, and everything in between.

Edit: What WAE is that in your last post. I have wae EXT, wae!^%# and a few others. But none that have the simplicity as yours. I would like to aquire if i could please. Thank you again!
