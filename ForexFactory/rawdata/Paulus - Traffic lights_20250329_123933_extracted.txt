Hi Had a few messages to post this system came from Expatts scalping system i just tried to make it more mechanical for my self..its what we do here we take a system and adapt it to our own perfered way of trading. I should say from the off I cannot put in loads of time answering questions so after my initial post i will give all the information I can which will hopefuly answer most questions.Im not looking for this thread to get 5 gold medals or run in thousands of posts..all i want is to show that you can scalp in a mechanical way. Traffic lights because thats how my mind thinks when im trading red I stop green i go simple as that. The signals 2 types Normal and safe, safe happen less frequent but have a higher strike rate I use a 10 pip stop 10 pip tp I stop for the day when I have 20 clear pips thats $1k per week per contract.The longer i stay in the market the greater my risk.If my 1st 2 trades win I stop and go to sim if I want to. Ok trades for the asian sessian so far as with most of my screen shots I will show when the 20 has been hit .. Please be patient I will give inds templates and rules later today if time permits,those that know of me will know I had to leave the boards for personal reasons its only recently Iv come back but time is still very very lmt. The 1st 2 signals are deemed 'safe ' signals the 2nd 2 are deemed ' normal' signals

Thanks Paulus, Expatts scalping system is profitable

Hi Paulus, thanks.......

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hello Paulus, Looking forward to your method. Thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Waiting...waiting...waiting...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thank you for your new thread, and waiting for your system. Best regards

--- 帖子 #8 ---
thanks , well done

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Looking forward to the method and template. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
i am so curious. traded ex system a bit, but need something a little more mechanical...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
He already discussed the rules of this, in the otherthread. Here is a PDF of the posts. At the bottom of each post in the PDF is the link where it came from. Edit, I removed my attachements, because I see in his first post he want to post it when he is ready.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Will check it out.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
where are you Paulus ? we are waiting for your system http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif thank you

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Looking forward to the system!

Paulus pretty well laid it out in his posts in the 'Scalping the E/U Reborn' thread. Paulus isn't teasing us by not posting more info on THIS thread, but his priorities I believe right now have changed as he is diverting his attention to handling some time consuming personal issues. I don't believe there are any 'new' unrevealed secrets to his strategy, but I, along with everyone else, await any new developments to his 'Traffic Light Strategy' should that be the case. Bear in mind I love what he has developed and yes, I am trading it successfully live. So for those of you who can't wait to check it out until Paulus returns, I am taking the liberty of showing the posts where he explains his system. Hopefully this will also help Paulus out when he comes back, as he won't have to go back to 'ground zero' to explain the strategy as you will all be familiar with his system up to the point where he started this thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...94#post2122194 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...88#post2135488 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...88#post2135488 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...00#post2159400

Ok, so as I understand it: Take the 15 min CCI chart. If CCI is greater than 0 look for long trades. If CCI is less than 0 look for short trades. On the 5 min chart: If the 15 min CCI is up, and the 5 min CCI changes from below 0 to above 0, place a long. If the 15 min CCI is down, and the 5 min CCI changes from above 0 to below 0, place a short. What I don't see are exits. Are they just simple TPs?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
It appears he uses a flat 10 TP and 10 SL. Go back through that thread and look at his charts. That's all he shows- +10 or -10

--- 帖子 #18 ---
It will be interesting to see if this traffic lights system is consistent... more winners then losers... I have more faith in a discretionary system as I believe market conditions change all the time, but with a RED/GREEN... black and white system, a computer can trade this and since there is no room for discretion, then that's the perfect system for an EA... or beginners... or anyone else that prefers a mechanical approach. The reasons most EAs don't work is because there are too many variables in the market... Too many ifs... the formation of a single particular bar will bias traders to reverse positions quickly, or enter new positions, and the market has changed, and indicators, which lag, are always trying to catch up. Thats my only doubt about "Traffic Lights" but then again, if you're right, more often then wrong, then the odds are in your favor... lets see

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Ok, here is the traffic light!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
EA does not work. no open trade since this morning. EA use CCI 13 instead CCI 8

--- 帖子 #23 ---
EA's definitely working. Did you change the lot size from 0? Changed the CCI to 8.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
double CCI5min1 = iCCI(NULL, 5, 13, PRICE_CLOSE, Current + 0); double CCI5min2 = iCCI(NULL, 5, 13, PRICE_CLOSE, Current + 0); check this lines

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The current + 0 in the 2nd line was changed to current + 1.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hello Ronald, thanks for sharing the EA. If I remember right Paulus is waiting for the 5 min-candle close and entering the trade on the 2nd candle. All the best, Steve

--- 帖子 #27 ---
If that's the case, set EachTickMode to "False"

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hello Ronald, the last sell was wrong, 15 min CCI showed long. Ok, let's wait for Paulus. I had a quick talk with a seasoned trader. He told me Paulus is waiting 10 sec. But I don't want to confuse. Let's ask the master himself. Greetings from the Black Sea Steve

--- 帖子 #29 ---
i attached the EA to the 15 min chart and had a trade but the problem was it went up 12 pips (10 + spread) but the EA didnt close the trade automaticly do we have to moitor the trade or should the EA close the position? have stoploss at 10 and takeprofit at 10 just like paulus i have eachtickmode false usestoploss true (10) usetakeprofit true (10) should moneymanagement be false or true? thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I think this system does not work using only CCI, there must be some filters. I've made EA and results are not good. Waiting further explanations from topic starter

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Were invisibleSL/TP enabled?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
RR invisible stoploss true and invisible takeprofit at 1 should it be like this? thanks

--- 帖子 #33 ---
It should work based on how you described it to me.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I've got impeccably slow timing, so Paulus' method has been a lot easier and forgiving for me than Expat's pure method. There are far less trades, which means I have to wean myself off putting in 10-20 trades per session. The other discipline I need to develop is to not jump ship too early. Price will meander a bit sometimes before it reaches 10 pip target. But there's a high probability it will reach tp. As with Expat's system, I find the entry still hazy. Most times, for me, the 5m signals don't get a chance to reset (change from blue to red/red to blue), when a 15m signal comes up. The 5m will remain blue or red until the 15m signals thye next change. So when I get a signal from the 15m, I try to look for a decent entry in the 1m chart. Would like to hear how everyone makes their entry.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks for the posts and understanding about my present position which is on going Im afraid. How ever the rules are simple 5 and 15 min charts 15 tells us long or short signals Shorts CCI red on 15min CCI goes from blue to red on 5min enter 10 sec from end of candle Longs CCI blue on 15min CCI goes from red to blue on 5min enter 10 sec from end of candle SL = 10 pips TP = 10 pips Entry = Market on lmt if LMT on a short enter sell lmt 2 pips above close of candle if long enter lmt buy 2 pips below close of candle.All we are trying to do is get a better fill by reduce the spread to zero in theory..a but risky and some trades hit thier TP without retracing the 2pips for you to get filled. Take reversal if they occur I like trading 7.30am to 11am and 2.30pm to 5pm. But TP..SL and entry orders and times are yours to choose. I stop at 20pips for the day and go to sim if I have time.I havnt got loads of time to sit in front of the pc now and 20pips a day is $1k per week per contract. You will get some signals where the 5min goes red to blue and the 15min CCI is on the zero line having come from red I take these as valid signals.If the 15min CCI is red already and i get a 5min change from blue to red for the short I see these as safe signals. Look at the chart below signals from Friday PM I have also put on a 30min chart just to confirm the trend for me I may keep it I may not. 1st signal - white vert line change blue to red on 5min 15min is red 30 min is red this is a safe signal 2nd signal - light blue vert line change from blue to red 15 min red 30 min red - safe signal 3rd signal - yellow vert line change from red to blue 15min blue 30min blue safe signal 4th signal - red vert line change from red to blue 15 min blue 30min blue safe signal I may not be able to answer questions as I dont know when i can visit the boards again Please find template 5 and 15 and indicators Thanks Paulus

The morning signals for Friday 7.30am to 11am

--- 帖子 #37 ---
RRaygun, what does SignalsOnly and EachTickMode do in true or false mode? thnx k

--- 帖子 #38 ---
SignalsOnly: True: Will only display the selected alerts (Pop-up, sound, e-mail) and not place trades. False: The EA will place trades. EachTickMode: True: The EA will look for signals at any time during a bar. False: The EA will look for signals only at the end of the bar. Does that help?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello everybody, thanks Paulus for share with us this strategie, very simple i like so much. But until now I don´t understand how you use the Stoch, is just for safe trades? Could anybody explain it? Thanks Also thanks to Ronald for your work making this EA. Could you post the change that we need to modify just for totally automated Ea? I don´t know how to do it. I made some changes but dosn´t work. Thanks in advance to everybody.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hello Forenxe, Paulus wrote in another thread following. I had the trigger on the 5min ie we went from blue to red the 15min was red and was saying ok to take the short the stochastic is there just as an indication to me as to where we are in the cycle but plays no part in my entry Of cource it's nice if stoch headed up or down in desired direction... it's calming ;-) Paulus, thank you so much for all. Hope everthing will be fine around you. Steve

--- 帖子 #41 ---
What are you talking about? This is fully automated...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks for this system. I gave it a try today &amp; it seems to work well. Is this system good for EUR/USD or has anybody tried on other pairs. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Please Roland in wich timeframe we should atach the EA 15min or 5 min? Thanks

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Either. The CCI for the EA is hard coded to the 15 min and the 5 min TFs so it won't matter.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Is there a way the EA will just trade during the hours Paulus uses? 7.30am to 11am and 2.30pm to 5pm

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Having good results using this system for three weeks. In 5 minutes it has high probabilities of success if the stochc 5 and 14 both are coming from over /below 80/20 and in the ADX 5 the red and green lines are in touch or they are crossed yet in the direction of the trade. The 5 stoch not to be in over bough/sold area. In 15 minutes taking the confirmation with the stochastic 5 if it has crossed his signal line in the direction of the trade and/or the CCI8 is in the same color. Most times the stoch working better like a confirmation if is going to cross or has crossed the signal line. Only working 3-4 hours per day, from 12:00 to 15:00 GTM. The stoch’s in 3 3,close/close, simple. . Best regards Sorry for my poor English

Paulus, A. Image. I can't thank you enough for the info. I fallowed the Kelt System and now this one. My question is I got in on the first Image and as u can see it fallows your rules. B. Image. As you can see from the second image the 5 min cci settings 8,1 is getting ready to passed down through the zero line (In White) but the 15 min cci is still above the zero line. CONTINUED NEXT POST

--- 帖子 #48 ---
C. Image Now as you can see the cci 5 min has now passed down through the zero but the 15 is still up. D. Image. On this one you can see the 5 min cci has passed back up above the zero line and the 15 min cci is still up. E. Image. As you can see I got out at BE and it went up to 7 pips profit and then just dropped. The question is when we enter and then the 5 min cci turns ageist us do we get out even though the 10 pip SL has not been hit or do we ride it out? Also...what if the 5 cci and the 15 cci turn on you but the 10 pip SL has not been hit do you get out or stay in? Again Thank You for all of your help and kindness Take Care, Forex Shark

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hello Dibanos, pics says more than 1000 words.... I think that's true. It will be nice, if you show us your ideas at examples on a chart. ''The 5 stoch not to be in over bough/sold area. '' Please, explain it more exactly! Thanks..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The idea is to do the trades using the CCI8 like the principal indicator, and the next filters: 5min (a) stochs 5 and 14 are coming both from above 80 or below 20. and (b) The stoch 5 not to be in over bought or over sold. and (b) ADX lines red and green are in touch or crossed 15m (c) CCI8 to be in same color like CCI8 in 5 min And/or (c) stoch 5 is going in the direction of the trade, and coming from above 80 or below 20. The CCI8 in 15 min could not be in the same color like the CCI8 in 5 min, but if the direction of this and the direction of the stoch5 in 15 min are in the direction of the trade it has good probabilities of being successful, even better probabilities if only using the CCI8, and it is in same color in 5 min and 15 min, but this CCI8 and the stoch5 are in different direction of the trade. The great opportunity is that in 3 hours (12-15 GTM= 8-11 EST) usually are several opportunities to do 2 net successful trades (20 pips) per day. Using a stop and take profit of 10 pips. Hope this explain better the idea. Of course this is the Paulus system with only a few observations. Best regards

--- 帖子 #51 ---
More charts Best regards

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hi Dibanos, Correct me if I'm wrong. Basically stoch 14 is representing stoch 5 in 15mins. If that the case, I would strongly agreed with you when your stoch 5 and 14 ideas. I can only used stoch in my broker graph and normal CCI. No more fancy indicator as in MT4. So I'm practically using stoch as the entry point. I've been using expat method on 1,5,15TF. Whenever, I saw all the stoch coming down to 80, or climbing up to 20, that's would be the safe entry guarantee of at lest 10-15pips depending on the volatile. But I only kept 7-8 at most to avoid big reversal. I'm using 10pips including spread if this safe setup occurs. When 1,5 TF, I'll take 3-5 and nothing more.

hi guys thanks for all your work I know I have some charts to look at here I will try and give it some time but its diff .. I have marital probs and life is difficult atm but thats life and we will survive because the love is strong it will just take some time Thanks again for the work on this from all of you I appreciate it I really do Paulus

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Paulus, No worry, time will heal the wound. Just take care. Hope to hear from you again once everything settle. I'm a fan of your method, including Kelt System.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hey Fx Shark, whic indicator is the dots that appear in your charts?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Yes, you are right, basically the 14stoch in 5min is the same think like the 5stoch in 15 min, but in the real using the 14stoch in 5 min gives a better idea that a trade is coming because it is changing with the 5min candles. If you see the “d” sell signal in the 5 min chart, the value of this 14 stoch in the two before candles is higher, and this is a good probability trade because it is going down; this is not possible to get in the 15 min chart. Also, not always the 5stoch in 15 min is so clear. By now, I think a combination of both stochs is better, but you know with more time and experience of using this strategy this idea could change. The CCI8 and the normal CCI are the same think, only with the visual advantage of the blue and red bars of the CCI8. I believe if you compare the CCI of your actual broker chart and the metatrader normal CCI, both could be the same or very similar. Best regards Dibanos

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Here's a non-lag dot indicator. But you notice that forex shark is using it instead of colored candles. Other than that - it's just another useless indicator that doesn't tell you anymore then your eyeballs can IMO. But, if it floats your boat - enjoy!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Oh i already know that indicator (if i remember well it repaint the past also), but thank you very much

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Tunera &amp; Flamenco143 Thanks for posting the indi and I hope that helps

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi tunera, Previously, I use nonlagdot for GJ. I dont recap noticing the repaint of this indicator. It's kinda useful but require other analysis to filter the sideways trading. Coz, when ranging, then this indicator is not as useful as u see.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thx, dibanos, I understand. But practically, I'm just trading expat method. Therefore, maybe in the future, I would integrate Traffic light into my trading style. As I still more time for better entry.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
What time zone?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
That's all that Paulus posted on it. Paulus can you clarify in GMT time. Or does anyone else know?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
He's talking about London time - 1 hour later than GMT

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Paulus' most recent chart posting was an Alpari Chart (see the fine print at the bottom of the chart), and I believe Alpari's server is GMT +1. His trading times (7:30 - 11:00 AM) are marked right on that chart, so he must be using GMT +1 Cheers.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks Ronald for programming this EA. I am running it on a demo so far and it is doing fine. A few trades lost, but more went positive. Also tried meanwhile having any other trades on the same chart simultaneously, but the EA cleared all those trades within seconds of placing. LOL, is like a jealous girlfriend. BUT.....who needs more trades when this way it is SOOO easy to make 2x a trade with 10 pips profit a day???!!!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
How are you using the RR EA in the EachTickMode? true or false Thank you

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Using the RR EA, but it does not take the profit at 10 pips but also does not take the stoplost at 10 pips. The TakeProfit is set at 10 pips and also the StopLost is set at 10 pips. What I am doing wrong with the EA? Is it something related with the Slippage? Thank You This was a buy at 1.4057 and this was a correct decision of the EA because the price got up until 1.4072 (15 pips) but it didn’t got the Take Profit. After that the price got down until 1.4037 and finally took the Stop Lost at 1.4042 (15 pips). Best Regards

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Did you set an invisible stop or a hard stop?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thank you very much for your answer. No, I have not set any invisible stop or a hard stop. Even, do not know how to set one of those. How could I check if one of those is already set in my metatrader station and so giving me problems with your EA? Best regards

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Check the settings of my EA. There should be options for invisible/hard stops

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Should we set it up as hard or invisible stop?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Depends on your broker. Some brokers don't allow trades with stoplosses/takeprofits which are smaller than the spread, or less than or equal 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Ronald, can you add a time option for this in your EA. Thanks, Ed

--- 帖子 #75 ---
TRUE

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Ronald. Not a good day so far with the EA, but I evaluate that as my lack of experience with setting this EA. I have UseStopLos true and also InvisibelStopLoss mentioned as true Don't know if that can be used this way, but this way it came OOTB. A bit more explanation would be appreciated about the last 6 settings, as I have the feeling we can do more with this EA. Maybe you can post a screenshot with a setting that should work the best. Thanks for all your support and dedication.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thank you Freddytx. One more question; In your trades the EA is taking the 10 pips stop loss and 10 pips target profit ? I do you this question because in my it is taking more than 10 pips for both. Some times 13, 15 or more. Best regards

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Updated with a time trading option.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thank you. You do good work, I really appreciate it

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I am experiencing the same, but understand that it is being caused by the amount of slippage that we put. OOTB is comes with 5, so that explains the 15 at times. I tried reducing it, then the EA takes vacation and no trades LOL. I have made a whole document with settings and explanations, but I miss lots of experience in this EA matter and asked Ronald to go thu it and make corrections for me. I think he will like what I did so far, and if it can be published, should take a lot of the questions away here.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
GREAT, but that I did not include yet in the document, you might want to add that for me, so we can help the whole community.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hmmm, I deleted the earlier EA and then the new one, restarted the platform, but I don't see any changes in the settings. Did I miss anything?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Freddy, Looked the same to me, also.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Reattached. For some reason it's fine for me.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Freddyfx - I am not that familiar with EA's, so would love a copy of your document when it is finished, please. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
This time it works. Guess the time settings use the ones from the broker platform, if so, then it is self explanatory. I use it on IBFX, who by the way have changed their zero requirement spread on taking actions to 3, just like FXDD is using. Makes a man wonder if these brokers also talk with each other behind our backs, LOL

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Maybe I am biting myself too much into this EA usage. So far is looks to me the EA would do better if all trades were simply the other way around. I have 2 setups on different demos. The OOTB one and my own playing around setup basically end up giving the same results........losing most of the time. When you evaluate some 2 days of testing to what the charts show, the EA seems to enter at the "right" moment, when the move is basically done with, leaving the profitable ones ONLY for the continuation of the move....and those moves do not happen that often. I am interested to hear what other traders are experiencing. PS: Don't get me wrong, the EA is brilliant programming to me as a newbie, and would make me happier if I could simply reverse the trades it is taking now....just a thought. In any case, I love this entering a trade and automatically setting me up for TP and SL, as I never trade with a SL and mostly sitting a trade out, which got me into MCs a couple of times, stupid me !!!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Freddy What S/L TP/ are U using now??

--- 帖子 #89 ---
For me this system is no good, it looses money.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Trading this system manually, for me, makes me money. Although there were 1 or 2 losers today.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
OK guys, spent a few hrs last night on getting all the rules down for setting the EA. Then sent them to Ronald to verify and add and complete the different settings and this morning I found the document back. I am allowed to share it with you, which I do hereby. Hope this helps many of you. For me, the EA does not cut it, but that was not the purpose of getting the settings all explained. I learned again, thanks Ronald.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Guys Im glad you running with this I think is shows great promise its just a shame I cant run with you atm but I appreciate yoy guys and the work your doing Im so thankful to you all. I am looking at the Heiken Ashi smoothed indicator to replace the CCI on the 5min..it gets you in 90% of the time at the same time as the CCI but on odd occasions gets you in earlier and is working quite well.I'm going to monitor it for a few week just to see the results I will attach the ind for those that don't have it. If you look at my 5min chart for this morning you will see yellow arrows which are entries with the CCI and mauve arrows which are entries using the HA basically if the 15min is saying long wait for 1st long HA candle in my case Ive colored them blue.As you can see the 1st signal triggered earlier.In an ideal world you could then close when the HA turns red but not sure how this works long term yet..but worth a look i think. Cheers and thanks again Paulus

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Ok Guys just took another signal here if you look at the chart my HA went from blue to red on the 4th bar back from the last bar when the HA went blue I went long and got my 10 pips in around 3-4 mins. If you look at the CCI 8 in the middle pane you will see it didn't trigger a signal and it stayed blue the whole time. BTW my 15min gave me permission for the long. I didn't take the 1st signal as I wasn't set up in time and I norm start at 7.30 the signal was at 7.25..how ever I took the last 2 and now have my 20pips and my day is over...nice ! Paulus

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hey Paulus, Are you just using standard settings for the HA Smoothed? Thx.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
yea 0132 cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Good morning so far with the 20 pip tp and 10 pip sl gives me a better RR will trade like this for a while see where it goes Paulus

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi My chart for today so far atm the time is 07.40am in the uk If you look at my chart you will see that the 20 pip tp 10 pip sl is working nicely. I like the 2:1 RR I know I can have 2 losers with just a winner to even things up..also with my ' stop at 20 pips' rule one signal that wins when i start means my day is over early. One thing has come to light though with the 20pip tp , if you look at the chart at A you will see a short signal before the 20pip tp is hit I get another signal if your money management can cope with it take this signal at B..you are now live 2 signals but the signal at A need only move a few pips now to hit its 20 tp The reason I think its important to take if you can is that if you missed the signal at A you would of taken the signal at B ..its a valid signal its strength and % chance of hitting its TP is the same as A so why ignore it..thats emotional and dangerous in my opinion. If your accounts money management wont allow you to take 2 signals consider funding your account with a few more $ or go down to a mini or micro contract to enable you to do it The signal at C had to be reversed because the long signal came along before C had hit its TP. Again its a valid signal the system is saying long ...why stay short - doesn't make sense isn't logical ..traffic lights ..... red stop green go that all you need to know at time of posting thelast signal on the chart is up 12 pips ... cheers Paulus

Hi paulus , i saw your pic and signals , in this post in 6:40 we havent buy signal in 15min time frame it is still sell signal !!! and in your previous posts you get some like this that they didnt confirm in 15Min timefram why ? in 7:45 we have buy signal that confirmed in 15m but we get stop loss not Tp , close on 1.4191 entery 1.4192 or 1.4190 our stop loss is 1.4182 or 1.4180 our take profit is 1.4210 or 1.4212 but it hit Stoploss , in your pic you show us it hit tp what is wrong with you ? for what you try show a losses trades in profit trades ?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
what is wrong with you ? for what you try show a losses trades in profit trades ? With regular candles on the charts instead of Heiken Ashi Smooth it appears you are right 919 and it DID hit a stop loss. On the chart Paulus has he is using just the Heiken Ashi candles, and they do not show the downward spike that caused that trade to be a loser. This is one reason I don't like the HA Smooth candles and therefore don't use them. I want a more 'accurate' picture of what price is doing than what they show. My problem with your post was that, while English I'm assuming is not your first language, was rude and hostile, as though you are accusing Paulus of being a fraud and a fake. I have followed Paulus in all of his threads, and I hold him in the highest regard! He has done nothing but try and help others, and when he screws up he admits it. Instead of apparently accusing Paulus of being stupid and trying to put something over on us (which is what the tone of your post implies) it would be much less objectionable had you asked him to explain the discrepency between him showing the trade as a winner, and you showing it as a loser. Give the man a chance to explain why instead of jumping to conclusions!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
yes , you are right I think paulus is a good man that try to help others , but my problem is : i saw many times in paulus pic that he wrote +10 or +20 but when i go to my chart (Alpari that paulus use) see that those signal get stoped but paulus write +10 or +20 I dont understand for what paulus do this !!! sorry for my english and using some bad words

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I appreciate your 'apology' and I'm sure Paulus will too. I'm not going to presume to know why he is showing those trades as winners. For some reason he has endorsed the use of the Heiken Ashi Smooth for scalping, and I know that he is using them also on his new daily/weekly trading system. Like you, I would also like clarification. As I mentioned before, I don't like the HA Smooth candles because I've seen in the past prices spike 80 or 90 pips in one candle time frame, but the HA Smooth never showed it. And having the HA showing over regular candles is a visual nightmare for me. I'm aware of the advantages of HA Smooth and why some traders like them. They just don't work for me. And by the way, your English is FAR better than my Farsi!

Hi Paulus, Thanks for taking the time to share.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
How long have you being trading with these system; two or tree days ? are you discipline with the rules? I am sure not. Well, I have been doing with this even before this tread began and I am sure this is one of the best systems for scalping in Forex Factory and all thank to Paulus. About that 7:45 signal it is clear like Paulus says it was a TP, what could happened is that you took the trade in the first candle in blue ( if began in red) when it was at the highest point but did wait until the next candle to do the buy. It is important to practice and make your questions in the tread, I am sure several people could help if you ask in the correct way. But finally if you are not comfortable here, you can go to other thread to place your rude comments.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi ... yes your right the winner is in fact a loser hitting its 10 pip sl to the pip sorry guys it wasnt intentional I promise. As I said you take the basic system and do what you will with it ..you could use swing low as stop but all down to you I didnt mean to mis lead you... As for the long when we are going red to blue on the 15 min and its on the zero line ie going up and I get a long signal on the 5 min I take it thats what I call a normal signal. I dont start till 7.30am and got my 20 pips by 10.30am I had the 10 pip loser then a 20 pip winner I then took a long at 10am chart time and close at +10 pips didnt wait for the 20 target ( although it did hit it) that made my 20 so quit for the day My pm session start at 2.30pm uk time I then had -10-10 +20 +20 +20 Flat at the time of this post my last signal; being a long at 5.45pm UK time 6.45pm Chart time.15 and 30 min currently long and sitting waiting for a long signal on my 5 min .. My last long signal entry was at 1.4166 it hit my 20 tp and went straight up and is now sitting at 1.4329 sorry for the mistake .. Paulus

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Well - in all fairness, I think I may have to reconsider my rejection of the Heiken Ashi Smooth candles. If Paulus adopted them in his strategy there will be good reasons for it. They just didn't work for me when I used them with a complete different system and time frame. I believed that because they eliminated the wicks and spikes of regular candles that that was a negative thing. However, upon watching the trades unfold candle by candle, that COULD be a good thing. Glad to see you back posting a little bit Paulus. Hope the situation which was diverting your attention from the forex is getting better.

Thanks Paulus for your explenation sorry me for bad words that i used

no worries 919 .. I love you all Paulus

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Paulus, good stuff, been trying it out. Whilst not a 100%, if you keep it regimented, it works in the long run. Another way of scalping the EUR/USD effectively (if you get my drift) cheers, Matt

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Matt Cheers for that I have always traded on the principle of taking out only so much and stopping for the day for me personally its 20 pips.I imagine trading like swimming with sharks in the ocean i get my 20 ive not been eaten yet but there is a very high chance I will lose my gains and my life so I get out the water and watch others get eaten. Sooooooo .... the system helps me find quite reliable signals for taking that 20 and it works for me..whilst others are getting eaten Im having a nice drink and chilling by the pool..lols dont get me wrong I get bitten here and there but always seem to manage to get out of the water If you take any part of it no matter how small and apply it to your trading and your own systems then you have gained some thing we all help each other its the way of things cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #112 ---
To take market or limit order hmm tough and we need a rule that is mech so the rest of this week and next week Im going to... If the entry candle high to low is 15 pips for more bearing in mind our stop is 10 then I will go in with a lmt buy or sell 2 pips below the close for a long 2 pips above the close for a short. If not then i will go with market and suffer the spread since 1min past midnight I have had the following +20-10+20-10-10+20-10-6(reversal)+20-10 = 24 pips My 1st trade ( green signal) at or after 7.30am hit 20 pips so I'm done for the day BTW the green line on my chart is price I converted the price to line . The stoch CCI ADX and the 2 ma's on my chart play no part in signal selection I leave them there just to see if there is any correlation between winning and losing signals and what those indicators are doing at the time...but they play no part in my trading entry or exit/ Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hey Paulus, Would you mind revisiting your entry rules with the new version using ha's? Are you still looking at both 15min and 5 min charts, or can it be done with just 5 min chart alone? Are you still using the adx for entry, or just stoch and ha color change? Is stoch to be both green over red AND over 70 for long, or just line orientation alone? I've played with ha's on futures, but not on forex as of yet. Are you waiting for bar close to confirm a color change, or just entering when you know it will remain the same color? Maybe a new post with updated rules are in order, or edit of post #1? I'd appreciate it, looks like an easy little system and right up my alley. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks much Paulus for all your time. Quick question: Which session do you feel offers you the best conditions? The morning UK or the morning US? I've been trading the morning US but find it real choppy. Wondering if I should get up in the middle of the night to trade the UK session. Thanks, Joe

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Are you still looking at both 15min and 5 min charts, or can it be done with just 5 min chart alone? Im still using the 15min which is important I think you cannot use the 5min alone you get whip sawed to often we want the overall momentum on our side and the only way i think that can bo done is to ride with the longer term trend Are you still using the adx for entry, or just stoch and ha color change? Im using just the HA colour change on the 5 min and being guided by the CCI on the 15min,,ie if 15min CCI is red I take shorts on the 5min when the HA gives me a red candle from blue Is stoch to be both green over red AND over 70 for long, or just line orientation alone? I dont use it but feel more confident in the signal if its coming down from OB for a short and up from OS for a long I've played with ha's on futures, but not on forex as of yet. Are you waiting for bar close to confirm a color change, or just entering when you know it will remain the same color? Im entering approx when there are 10 secs left of the 5min candle this isnt critical but I dont enter mid candle the candle has to be nigh on over Maybe a new post with updated rules are in order, or edit of post #1? Yes np will try and do I'd appreciate it, looks like an easy little system and right up my alley. Well I only want 20 pips a day this system seems to give reliable signals all you are basically doing is watching the long term trend if it is down then I wait for a price retracement which is indicated by the HA going blue then as long as the 15min trend is still red Im entering on the 1st red HA candle..it seems to work Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi Joe I nearly always get my 20 pips in the UK morning session 7.30am to around 11.30am..the US open can be volatile when the heavier volumes come crashing in. You may find 4.30pm to 7.30pm U time a little easier as the US would of been open for 2 hrs and it quietens off around US lunch time..even traders have to eat..lols hope it helps Paulus

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Paulus, Would you mind posting your templates for the updated procedure? I just want to make sure I'm looking at the same thing you are when I practice your system. Thank you for all your help. Ed

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Sure here is the template with the inds I use don't forget the stochastic and Ma's play no part more their there for observations You have tl 5 tpl which is the 5min template tl 15 tpl 15min template On the 5 min template put the stochastic , +stoch , HA ,Candle time On the 15min the CCI 8 the +stoch is the icon in top right of chart all im doing with this is to see if the 15 column is blue when my CCI8 on 15min is blue and red when its red ..its just a test programme atm and was given to me by the good guys in the trading room if it doesnt work for the system it will be removed

--- 帖子 #119 ---
The chart

--- 帖子 #120 ---
thanks Paulus, you're the man. josephus

--- 帖子 #121 ---
this shows the importance of having the 15 min without it we have no clue as to where the market MAY be going. The chart shows a majority of shorts notice how the dips down are stronger than the rallies up until the uptrend is established ..going with the shorts keeps us on the right side of the momentum If you trade the Asian session my 20pip tgt would of been hit on the 1st signal..when you have made your daily target stop ans go to sim don't swim with the sharks !!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Do you use a combination of HA and CCI on the 15min chart to find direction? Or is it just the CCI?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I'm about 99% sure that he just uses the CCI because the HA can lag a lot more in the 15m tf.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Yea your right just the CCI it seems to be very reliable. My 1st live trade today was -10 followed by a +20 which gave me 10 pips.. My 3rd trade was closed when it hit +10 pips giving me my total of 20 pips which is my daily target. My day was over at 10.35am uk time it started at 7.30am uk time.# 1 contract on 20 pips a day is $1k per week a nice round number..to make more money increase your contracts with money management do not try and get more pips out of the market ,personally I think this is a risky move. If you hit your daily target 90% of the time then your account will grow, emotionally you will feel great and you will have more free time Please don't think the answer is to take 50 60 100 pips out of the market daily you will implode and blow your account. Ive just watched the 4th signal make 20 pips ( it went 40pips ) I don't beat my self up about this more I think the system is good if I was on -20 right now I would be even..thats a good position to be in. Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Yellow are my trades green are system signals after my 20pips so on sim now Paulus

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Paulus. Thanks for share your system and update it. Only one question.In the case of having several losses row. How many pips have to lose to close your trading session? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hello everyone,I think the reason that people seem to want to go for more than there own self imposed number of pips per day besides greed is they may not have enough in there account a $1 or $2 per pip does not seem like a lot but it is better than working for someone else! but he who starts little by little makes there account grow! personally that is my goal everyday to make only 20 pips per day and no more.everytime you get in the market you put your capital at risk.GREAT SYSTEM PAULUS,THANKS FOR SHARING!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
yea good question Technically you should stop at -20 pips for the day..I personally dont do that Ive been to -30 and -40 a couple times on the 1 occasion when I had -40 I had 2 winners that brought me back to zero then over the next 3 trades had my 20 pips..the system relies on that at some part of the session the swap will trend. If your using money managment and start on the mini contract the losers wont hurt you..the aim is to gain your pip count for the day. If I funded an account with 100k Id prob take just 5 or 10 pips and stop for the day. but thanks for bringing it up Paulus

latest chart direction guided by 15 min dont forget

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Good response too. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
here is a normal signal the vertical red line on the 15min chart is time stamped at 18.15 pm with the CCI heading upto 0.00. When the signal bar finished on the 5min the time was 18.20pm and the CCI on the 15min was showing blue ..don't forget we don't wait for the 15min to finish its bar only the 5min also note the stoch both low coming out of over sold conditions .. although not an entry criteria but gives more confidence perhaps to take the signal. Look at the 30min chart at the time of the 5min signal the 30min was still blue .. so the 30min was showing a longer term up trend the red on the 15 min could of been just a pull back in that up trend and so we take the 5min signal when the 15min shows us some blue as we know the 30min is still blue ..you take what you feel is comfortable but logically thinking the set up was a good one Hope it all helps paulus

--- 帖子 #132 ---
PAULUS !!!!!! Great system, mate !! I have it all setup on my pc and started trading it now actively on demo, so far EXCELLENT. Keep up the good work. Wishing you a splendid weekend. PS: I tried it before with the EA, but that was very disappointing activity and I walked away for some time.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Can someone share a mtf cci? I would like to just run the one chart, the 5min, but still see the cci for confirmation from the 15min. There must be a mtf cci around, i've seen mtf everything else thanks P.S. would that actually be the same as putting a cci 24 on the 5 min chart? hmm

--- 帖子 #134 ---
hey Freddy ! Thanks I cant trade with Ea's myself and the system seems to be logical in its approach with money management it should survive. All we are looking for is a pull back on the short term chart to trade in the direction of the longer term trend simple as that.. most things that work are simple I find .,. Taking restricted pips per day using money management and trading with the longer term trend and entering on re tracements stacks the odds in your favor ...........and at the end of the day thats all we can do I cant say what the next bar will do all I can do is give an educated guess of where I think it may go given all the facts We need an edge I think this gives us that...............I hope !! Paulus

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yes, so very true. Ronald made a good effort with the EA he wrote and I went out of my way to get it all properly understood and explained here. Funny thing I noticed, the EA took trades, but the results were the other way around. Maybe some day try it on one account and then take teh counter trades, hahahaha, or ask him to reprogram its function I agree with you that watching a good trade develop, then enter and make the necessary 20 pips for the day is a real thrill. BIGGEST problem is then to walk away and I am training that......VERY HARD.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
yes I agree nothing in trading is easy apart from losing money it seems ...lols. the more robotic un emotional and detached you are from your trades the better you will trade Im sure..but its a tough mind set to get into the latest chart all guided by the 15 min dont forget the 'safe' signals these are signals where the 15 is for example blue and has been for a time you then get a re tracement on the 5min so it goes red and then we get blue again..that is classed as a safe signal the last 2 signals on the chart for example are safe signals..the signal that says 18.20pm is a normal signal

--- 帖子 #137 ---
My first live trade with this, thanks Paulus! Feel free to answer my question about whether a cci24 on the 5 min chart is just as good as having the cci8 on the 15min chart for verification? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Paulus Matt here from the 'room'. Re: the mtf CCI you mentioned yesterday, I think I've found an indicator for this. I won't post it yet until I've tested it in case it turns out to be cack, and someone treats it as gospel. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
For me, this is the best explanation of the Paulus method. I'm always tempted to jump in when the 5m gives a blue or red signal, even though the 15m shows the opposite colour--especially when price is moving fast and furious. I need to realise I've got a higher probability of success if I wait for the trend to establish itself on the 15m, wait for the pullback/retracement on the 5m, then jump on when it's ready to keep going.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Paulus, I'm trying to spot these 'safe' trades on the fly, and I'm wondering how you decide when the 15 min cci 'has been for a time'? How many same colored bars means it's found a trend? 3, 4, 5? Does it have to reach a certain level away from 0 before you feel it's a pullback and not just a whipsaw? Based on what you've learned so far, what would be your mechanical guidelines for spotting a 'safe' trade set up on the 15 min cci? Thanks, VBro

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thank you Paulus for this great thread. I like Tazmaan idea of the CCI24, I have tried it visually on the 5min, and even if it is not spot on on the minute, it might help. In my opinion we should watch out for signal that come after a noticeable swing, when price consolidate and indicators might lag, basic price action. I'll be testing this system live from tomorrow after playing around with it during this week end. Happy pipping to all

--- 帖子 #142 ---
hi paulus, thank you for sharing your easy system, i really like it, cant wait for next week to begin ... i was thinking about maximizing profits. i have added the 200sma on the 5and 15min chart, if the signal is long and price is above sma200, the exit is a short signal on the 15min chart. entry on 5 min by your rules, stop loss 10 pips, but after 20 pip gain, close out half and let the other half go until the contra-signal occurs. if the position gets stopped out, still banked +10 pips, but the possibility to gain 50 pips and more on the other half of the position. i dont know if it works or not but will watch it closely next week thanks paulus

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Titus. AUSGEZEICHNET !!! EXCELLENT !!! Good observation and it works, trust me, have been using it already in another strategy that I used before getting to this one, BUT..........Paulus is not teaching that as he believes in the system to not swim with the sharks unnecessary. So his rules work and pay you. Your rules work and pay you more. Personally I feel that Paulus can make more money adapting what you mentioned, while NOT risking getting bitten by the shark market change, thus not damaging his style, just needs to change his settings. PS: following this style, you would have banked already min 20 pips when the reversal sets in.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I think this is a great system, just what I have been looking for. Only one question: Has anyone ran any backtests to see which stop loss is the most profitable, ie. 10, 15 or 20? I agree with the take profit of 20 but seem to get stopped out at 10 only to see the trade continue to 20 pips profit. Thanks

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Is this with or without the spread factored in?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
You have never used the Candle with 8 0r 10 tick/Candle Breakout? I have seen in Trade Navigator.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
hi all Just back from week end away just walked through the door left friday night will attempt to answer questions as soon a humanly possible

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Then why don't you try with 20? Backtesting has no value, stop getting fooled by smart brokers, test on demo if you don't feel secure about your own trading style. THAT is where demos are made for. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi, Paulus, what is your opinion about correlation (so far)? 2. there is sentiments - ADX is absolutely useless, "trend chaser, not follower"; what do you think about it? thank you

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Taz will set up the CCI 24 on the 5min and take a llok over mon and tues cheers for the heads up. Pip - Brilliant I think it would help alot all on one will be easier keep me posted cheers.... Joem - its stacking the odds in your favour if yopu trade with the lobegr trend.. 15 for 5 min entry sems right ..the 30 or 60min for the 5min entry is too large and wont give an accurate representation of how things are unfolding in my opinion. In an uptrend the rallies will be stronger than the pull backs we want to trade the rallies..in a down trend the pull backs will be weaker than the drops so we want to trade the drops its not a guaranteed thing but gives us that edge i think vbro - a normal signal is when the CCI is going red through zero to blue for longs blue down through zero to red for shorts on the 15min ..as soon as the 1st 15min bar has formed and completed and is say red any signal on the 5min that is short is deemed to be safe as the down trend at this point has been running for 15mins what we want now is a pull back on the 5min which is defined as the 5min HA going blue then as the 1st red bar completes on the 5min we go short.... we are assuming that this will be the next push down on the 15min to continue the trend..hope that helps cesare -thanks for the observations i agree with what your saying for me it has to be mechanical if you can come up with a mechanical rule for that and it helps great we will add it .. sounds good Titus..used to use a simlar thing on Futures on the Russell 2000 trading 2 contracts one was called 'Account Builder',,say our 20 pips to grow the account the other was called 'Bonus runner' which captured more points I did put it on a blog not updated since Ive been trading Fiorex but here the link I will be interested in your findings If you have 10mins it may be worth a read http://paulus10-trendseeker.blogspot.com/ rcbarlow - re the stop loss this can be personal to you if you wish to risk 10% of your account per trade your stop will be larger but technically so should your tgt to get that 2:1 risk reward I think.. On my end of day trading with Forex I use the last swing low as a stop for my longs last swing high as a stop for my shorts in day trading its not viable I think the last swing low may be 30 pips away so to realise a 60 pip tgt may be pushing it but on my eod I may be 100 pips from a swing low and my tgt will be 200 pips but I don't care if it take 10 days to get there with day trading I want to be flat every night,but Il be interested in any results you have R Raygun I always take 10 pips from my fill price I set my sl and tp roughly then once filled modify my ticket to get the 10 and 20 exactly right..btw thanks for all the graft on the EA earlier very much appreciated appreciated thank you. Fxxx - I cant use the adx to be fair there are very few indicators I like..I like the CCI macd RSI because Ive always managed to make money with them.They judge a pull back for entry really well I love the HA though I must say. Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I tend to leave my 10 pip stop wher it is but for the more conservitive you may want to protect your account by moving your stop when ever we reach a danger area..in the case of a long we have just taken that will be the lat swing high ..this only applies if we are not above the high of the day. here is my chart from friday and Ive marked where the danger areas are if you bring your stop to break even at this point you are protected in case the swap makes a double top and punches down. the 2nd chart show a position in more detail its not a great example but hope you get the idea. I used this on my futures trading

--- 帖子 #152 ---
A example of a -10 pip loss that could of been a +0 This example is a perfect set up of what could happen..dont forget we are trading with the trend so idealy we are always going to have to break the last high for a long and the last low for a short.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
please dont forget you will remove losers but you will also remove winners moving your stop like that but it is a safer way to trade Paulus

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Another thing I used to use on Futures was 3 successful signals in any one trend and Id stop trading that trend untill a new one developed. I found it was rare to get 3-5 winning signals from a trend they get tired and round over or bottom out If I had 3 winners from it then I had taken the best of the momentum and would stop trading ..I got out the water Not sure with forex will try to keep a check on it Paulus

--- 帖子 #155 ---
My first trade of the week Got +25pips, I like! Price bounced back off a trendline I had on the 15min and I used as TP. This chart shows the CCI24 on the 5 min chart, but I'm still using the 15min. Happy trading all

--- 帖子 #156 ---
hi freddy, danke ! look first trade for today, i didnt take this trade, just want to see how this works out, but by now 100 pips plus, waiting for 15min. cci to cross zero line. hi cesare, nice trade did you enter on the closed 15min candle? paulus mentioned that its not necessary that a 15min candle closes above/beyond zero line, the 5min candle has to, when 15min crosses. (hope thats correct)

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi Titus, I have entered when the 5min crossed, the 15min CCI was already long since 7:45 UK time. My entry was at 1.4515 (8:25 UK) including the spread, right at the zero bounce of the CCI8 on the 5min.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
yes i see that was a good one

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I just gave back 11pips on a weak signal around a time that probably shouldn't have traded... I even have the session lines on the chart, I guess I tried to end the day early, I'll be back fo NY, not big deal, I hope... :-)

I think that's the price line. (Historical closing price)

--- 帖子 #166 ---
This only work with EUR / USD?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
With all pairs.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
yes thats correct the green line is just the price but as a line chart not bar or candle .. And the signal on the last chart I posted went very well..mainly because we trade in the direction of the trend in this case long on both the 15 and 30 min we got the momentum in our favour Paulus

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I guess this question is for me regarding my chart post? The green line is just the priceline, as I have it set to line chart instead of bar chart so the heiken candles are cleaner. Not sure which red line you are referring to though. Edit: nevermind, I see you are referring to Paulus's chart, I am not sure what his red line is, probably a moving average he has on there.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
my 15 min shows just blue my 30min shows just blue hence just the longs on the 5min ..look how weak the pull backs are and how strong the rallies to make new highs into the trend...why would you want to trade on the short side. have to stick to where the strength is I think Paulus

Another couple wins for me, and this last trigger I am letting it ride with a trailing stop. Paulus, you might be single handedly saving my lousy small forex account that I almost gave up on Now we just need someone to code an ea for this badboy

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Nice taz But dont forget this is an ideal trend any trend following system will make money on this type of move..the nice thing is that we are trading in the right direction and there will be days when you struggle ..but with good money manegment and a risk reward of 2:1 your account should be safe as I believe we have that edge albeit small to make consistant profits. The last signal went nicely

--- 帖子 #173 ---
This trend has given us 6 signals 5 winners at 20 pips 1 loser at 10 pips this is an above average move after 3 wins in any trend be careful quite often the thing to do is sit it out after 3 or 4 signals if their winners and wait for a direction change but as always up to you the individual trader Paulus

signals for EURGBP 2.30pm on all guided by 15min

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I'm trying to put together another EA for this new version: So, for: BUY: 15 Min CCI(8) is above 0 5 Min Stoch(5, 3, 3) is less than Stoch(4, 3, 3) and both are above 80. 5 Min Heiken Ashi changes from red to blue. SELL: 15 Min CCI(8) is below 0 5 Min Stoch(5, 3, 3) is greater than Stoch(4, 3, 3) and both are below 20. 5 Min Heiken Ashi changes from blue to red. Did I miss something?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
ok red on 15min so no more long signals taken on 5min we sit and wait for the 5min to go blue then red..if 15min still red we go for it When the 1st red bar appeared on the 5min the 15min was still blue wasn't going blue to red through 0.00 was just blue so couldn't take.You wont get every twist and turn we need a trend of sorts to establish 1st Notice the stronger pull back as the buyers dry up and sellers take over this could be the start of a down trend as always I wont guess but wait until im told by the 15min and then the 5min to enter Paulus .

--- 帖子 #177 ---
hi RonR seems ok but I dont take into account the stoch .. 15min blue 5min goes red to blue on HA thats the entry visa versa for shorts hope that helps

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Paulus should be the one to answer this obviously, but as far as I know we aren't using the stoch at all anymore. It's strictly cci8 on 15 min chart (or maybe cci24? still comparing) and the color change for the ashi. I look forward to seeing what you can come up with ronald!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Paulus, what timeframes are you finding are doing well for this? I am on PST time, so am trying to find some hours that will work well for me.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Are you still using the cci though?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hey Ronald, (Disreagard the post's title, question already answered) First I'll take the opportunity to add to the chorus of thanks for all your efforts through the forum - you are an asset to this place! (This might be impossible) I think the idea is to take the trade when the 1st 5 min bar closes with the new color. The challenge here is that system does not wait for a closed 15 min candle, it accepts a color change mid candle as a green light. But system does require the 5 min candle to be closed to green light this part of the trade. In your prior EA, I think it was set up to be either tick or close for both, but the system really calls for tick on the 15 and close on the 5. Is this possible? Of course, I may be wrong about this, Paulus will correct if need be I am sure. Kind Regards, VBro

--- 帖子 #182 ---
If "trade on the close of a 5 min candle" then simply set the EA on the 5 min TF and set eachtickmode to "True"

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Whichever way I used the earlier EA, I ended up with more losers then winners, so eventually gave up the testing of it. Still I am sure Ronald can get it working the right way, just some little tweaking, lol

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Paulus, It seems there are times when the 5 min cci still leads the HA - see chart. What are your thoughts about taking whatever signals first as the trigger?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
yes Ive noticed that One of the reasons I went to HA was that in a strong trend the CCI can just stay above 0.00 and you miss some nice entries that the HA picks up.... Yest afternoon we had 6 signals in the uptrend 5 wins 1 loser the CCI8 gave 5 ...2 on the same bar , 1 earlier ,1 later and one it dint get which went on for 20 pips. you can use the CCI8 like you suggest I cant see any harm in it,its horses for courses perhaps we should keep a check on it for the rest of the week Cheers for the suggestion Paulus

--- 帖子 #186 ---
1st live signal for me today I start at 7.30am signal was at 7.30am got my 20pips day over for me..nice work if you can get it ! cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Paulus! How long do you use this system on live? I've msde EA and i'm shure it works right according to your rules. But the fact is that EA makes more loosers than winers. Have to notice that september is very good for this system. From 01 of september hit rate was about 70%. But in long run (for ex. from 01.01) EA blow 10000 account quickly with 25% profitable trades.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Paulus, was the 15min CCI in the red when you entered this trade? as I was looking at the chart but on my chart the first red bar came at 7:30, then I entered two wrong signal 8:35 and 9:05, both for a loss.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I'm having the same issues too. My only guess is lack of sufficient data.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
If anyone here has tick data, why don't you give this a try?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Paulus, I took a trade where the HA candle changed from blue to red midway (see arrow). Actually it was a blue bar which developed a red stem. I took the trade because it pushed through a little wall of resistance, and got 20 pips. Is this what you do with changing candles?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi cesare76fx I agree with you about the 7.30 signal my 15min was green too. Would not have taken your other entries as they are both at news-time. Terry

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I put it on the demo and will report on it. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
My 7.30am signal time stamped on Alpari at 8.30am the charts are 1 hr ahead of actual time here Paulus

--- 帖子 #195 ---
joem I take the trade if short and red with 10 secs to go or at candle close im not ridged about this time but i wouldnt for example take a short signal on red with 30secs to go..I have to be close to the bar end and 10 secs seems right its a nice round number and again I have to be logical and mechanical and apply the rules to every trade Cheers paul

--- 帖子 #196 ---
The EA took so far 3 trades, all ended in a loss.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
hmm weird can you give me the times UK plse Thanks Paulus

--- 帖子 #198 ---
no signal for me yet this morning As you can see 15min saying look for longs we have 3 blue bars..the 5min has been blue but the 1st one came way before my 7.30am start as dipicted by the red dotted vertical line.....you can just see a red HA bar forming on the 5min if this stays red then I will go long on the close of the next blue 5min bar as long as the 15min is blue cheers paulus

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi Paulus, Looked again at that 7.30 trade the 15min candle would just have opened. The confimation of red on CCI would not be confirmed until the 15min candle closed. I was watching and can confirm on my 15min chart it was not red at 7.30!! To help us all please confirm how you use the 15min trade direction signal and did you jump the gun? Terry

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Terry, Why are you so adamant about the 15 Min CANDLE ? The control guide for the 15 Min chart is not the candle, but rather the CCI8 . The CCI8 is not always the same color as the candle.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Bobcat, I understand Terry point, as the CCI repaint itself I think he wants to understand (like I do) if it has to be confirmed in the red, like for an entry on the 5min, or just hanging around the red that could turn out to close in blu or at zero as there are 15 minutes to go and than that would be a fake signal.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
the CCI repaints?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Great system Paulus! Thank You for Sharing! I had a quick question just to understand the 15min. confirmation... do we need to have 3 bars close with the same color to confirm the trend direction or one bar would be sufficient? Thank You.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
i think repainting means, the changing of the indicator-value after the candle had closed !? cci doesnt do that but i think cesare is talking about the 15min cci gives signal (zero line cross) and then goes back beyond/above zero line, because the 15min isnt closed and the cci-value is changing until the candle is closed. that could give many false signals, the question is, if we should wait until the 15min cci candle closes beyond/above zero line or not.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
oh ok. thanks!

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I meant when the candle is still open, the trade I referred to, had the CCI on its first red/blu bar on open candle, that will repaint if the price shoot the other way, of course. EDIT: Ops, thanks Titus!

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Terry If you take the 15min and its red and then a new candle starts on the 15min the CCI will start to cross or hit the 0.00 line even though its still red its either on or just below the 0.00 if its a strong candle it will go blue at times.The 5min then goes from red to blue ..that is my signal...you can confirm with the 30min if you wish that may be blue any way if the trend is a strong on or use the CCI 24 if thats on 0.00 or above 0.00 take the signal Dont forget ignore the candle on the 15min its the CCI8 and you dont wait for completion on the 15min FXCash For a safe signal 1 completed bar on the 15min is enough a normal signal is outlined above to terry dont forget 1 bar on the 15min is 15mins of trend I have the 30min on my set up also just to take a look at what happening in a slightly longer time scale.. hope that helps Yest was tricky but got my 20 not till the pm session though ! Paulus

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Paulus, Thanks for your reply, that does make the system a little more discretionary. Terry

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Is good,in your opinion, Traffic lighs with Candle -10 tick(breakout) with trend measurable with CCI(24)?Thx

--- 帖子 #210 ---
A good friend of mine uses this system but trades slightly differently at +10 pips he moves his stop to break even and closes at +20 ..he says it works well but can screw up the 2:1 risk reward Another thing he looked at was taking a signl on the next bar in the opposite direction..as often when we get a signal the price then pulls back for example We get a blue buy signal on the 5min ..he then waits for a down bar following the blue signal..not a red HA candle but a normal red bar..this has often stopped him busting on on the fill if it was taken as originaly done as long as the 15min is still blue and the 5min is still blue on the HA it seems a good entry technice and i will be looking into it The chart shows to hypothetical signal arrows with later entry defined,but you will miss some signals with this method but may save losses

--- 帖子 #211 ---
As you can see red dotted vert line on 5min shows my 7.30am start line..15min blue 30 min blue so once i get red on 5min I will go long on next 5min blue after that..as long as 15min stay blue this should be a safe signal... paulus

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Paulus, Wonderful System...love it! Ready to pull the trigger on this next trade...thanks for posting and sharing! Bob

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Got a signal long and took it but went for 10 instead of 20 because there was a previous swing high. Price lingered for quite a while then hit the target. It then reversed to just below entry. Right now it's teetering above entry. It could reach 20, but I like Paulus' shark analogy. 15 min chart shows I'm still blue with ma lines crossing briefly. 5m shows blue signal to go. Missed out on a signal at 7:15 am that got 20 pips, then traded a signal at 7:38 edt which failed. Onwards.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Today I have been entering safe signals on the trigger bar and normal signals on the 1st pull back bar worked well this morning got my 20 only had to let 1 winner go as it went straight up and hit tgt without a down bar as it was a long paulus

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Joem you could of bought ur stop to break even at the last swing high..I used to call it a 'safety stop' you get alot of +0 trades BUT you cut down the losers dramatically wd Paul

--- 帖子 #216 ---
yes Paulus, I remember you saying that and did think about it. Turns the trade into a riskfree trade so to speak. But I was damn hungry for that 10 pips! joe

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Is everyone using a 10 pip s/l like Paulus recommended? I am having a really hard time today. I've been stopped out 4 times! I was doing very well earlier in the week, but today has been a disaster for me. I like the system very much and I thank Paulus for presenting it on the board. Happy trading to all.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
EURUSD is in a ranging period right now. massive upside resistance on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
yea know what u mean ! Ive put candles back on my chart so I can see up and down candles with line chart you cannot do this as it only shows the close. The S is for safe signals and these are entered on the actual signal bar ..a normal signal for a short I wait for an up bar to enter the short visa versa for longs its works quite well and I may well stick to it Paulus

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Eureka if you give me the time of the trades in Uk time Il take a look for you... Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Man, this is great system, I made 25 pips tonight (LIVE). But this is just a start Its very important to follow trend at the 15 min chart and follow the rules. Tnx for sharing sys

--- 帖子 #222 ---
This is my workspace right now as you can see the 5 min has been giving blue up bars on the HA ..but if you look at the 15 min although its got 13mins left to end the bar its giving me blue on the CCI8 which means I cannot take shorts on the 5min EVEN if I get a red HA on my 5min soon unless the 15min is at 0.00 or below If you then look at my 30min you will see its red..this could be a pull back on the 15min hence its gone blue but the larger trend is down ie the 30min.. as always im guided in direction by the 15min and entry by the 5min..the 30 min just helps me create a picture in my mind what is happening.. In this case a sharp rise in price over 5mins has caused the new 15min bar to go blue but the 30min is still trending down..unless the rally is strong we could push down again soon. I never really do market appreciation as I think it clouds the entry and is often wrong lols..I prefer to look at a mech approach to trend and direction...just my thoughts paulus

messy start back to zero

Thanks Paulus I've been folowing your system the last week and I like the simplicity very much, Did you trade in a exactly a period of the day , because I think we will avoide false signal. This morning we got A short situation but the price is ranging and giving to many wrong signal. I'm trying to attach the chart but isn't working. The perioid is this morning between 7 and 10 GWT Have a look please. Thanks [

Hi I do 7.30am to around miday uk time if I get my 20 pips I stop..I then do 2.30pm to around 5pm yes see the tough bottom but took the short..I dont look at levels I cant get a mechanical rule for it cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Had some loses playing this system. But that's normal in this market i guess. Have a nice weekend all!

--- 帖子 #227 ---
yes you will have losses but ANY system has losses and I defy any one to show me a system that doesn't.With correct money managment the losses wont hurt your account. Take a look at any professional traders or city traders sharps ratio you will see nasty dips ...thats their losses To be quite honest if I was trading allot bigger I would cut my daily target to 10pips its all about exposure in the market the less your exposed the less risk you have. Ive looked at lot of systems on this board and one thing they all have in common people show allot of interest initially then they take some losses and the thread dies ..this proves to me with doubt that people are on the eternal hunt for the holy grail perhaps its human nature I don't know all I do know is, all you can do in this business is try to stack the odds in your favour you need an edge..I beleive this gives you that edge we define a trend and we enter on a pull back what happens 1 second we are filled and in the market is out of our control if we go short and the market goes up 30 pips in the next 2 sec its not the system fault it cannot see into the future at what is about to happen..its the traders responsibility to control his/her losses with good money management so they can jump in the water tomorrow and swim with the sharks. Paulus

--- 帖子 #228 ---
if you look at the chart the 1st signal was taken when the 5min bar completed but the 15min was still forming and the CCI8 was moving from red through 0.00 to blue this is a normal signal If you look at the 2nd signal when the 5min bar completed the CCI8 had been red for some time hence its safe or perhaps I should say safer ! Once we have 1 formed bar on the 15 min we are in a safe period. Hope that helps Paulus

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Excuse my ignorance, but how do I know if I have tick data or not? Will this work with a normal demo account?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Go into the history center, and check your data. If the increments are only in minutes and not seconds, and sometimes miliseconds, then you have minute data, not tick data.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Thanks, looks like all of mine are minute data. Is that based on the broker? If so is there any that you know of that has the tick data?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
So far not a winning trade, switched it of after 8 losing trades. Will test again when this market returns to a more normal one, LOL.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Paulus and group: This method is working for me, even in this choppy market. I find that keeping an eye on the 5M and 15M stochs really help your judgement in which trades to go into following this method. Sure, I've lost some trades, but the 10:20 SL:TP really makes a huge difference. Hows is everyone else doing?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
doing well here few scary moments but thats trading getting my 20 every day which for me is the most important thing. The other important aspect is money management its this that will keep you alive when we get a losing run and that will happen with ANY system Onwards and upwards Paulus

--- 帖子 #235 ---
How do you use stoch exactly?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Paulus,have you news filter for your Traffic Lights ?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi, maybe you should stop after your third loss and stay on the sideline making papertrades. If your performance is getting better again its time to resume. That would be a typical anti-martingale strat. I would prefer to display this set up like in the attached picture but unfortunately i don't know how. http://codebase.mql4.com/c/codebase/...ibsmoothed.gif I realy don't know how reliable this system is. I like it and it's looking quite good but: I think it can be rather good programmed and executed automatically. There are some posts in this thread which attest bad backtesting results for this system. Especially the good results in september are a strong hint. So i would deal it with great care. Don't get me wrong but i think the main reason why accounts often are blown is that systems doesn't get tested enough. I think its difficult to trust a system that wasn't tested for at least 300 or better much more trades. Maybe you can dispel my concerns. Sorry for my mediocre english.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I've been trying to trade a couple of hours before the US session opens, but it's not optimal for this system. I end up jumping on signals that have no follow through. Everyone's jockeying for position before the usual 8:30am news release, then again for the sometimes 10am news release. So I'm going to start trading after the news settles, which is after 10 most days. That way I won't be wasting time and I'll avoid trading my usual monkey business methods. Today there was a good signal at 10:35 am. And I've got to crack the whip and trade at 2:30 am like Paulus does. That first 2 hour window regularly has good opportunities.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi Paulus, The system looks very good, thanks. I'm not so good with Money Management Systems, can you please explain the system you use. Yellow

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I have been using this on demo for about a month with good results. I have also increased the RR from a 10SL 10TP to a 10SL 15 or 20 TP depending on the 4 hr trend. If I'm going with that trend then I will open the TP to 20 or so If I am against the 4hr trend I will run it a bit tighter 15 or maybe 10. I seem to get the best results with this system from about 12pm Pacific time to about 5PM. I'm trying out later at night now. Yesterday I had 2 trades 1 loser 10 pips one winner 14 pips. Thanks Paulus for sharing this with us &amp; to the ones srtuggling, I would say just make sure you are following the rules of the system &amp; maybe just go with a 4hr or 1hr trend till you get the hang of it. This seems to me to be a really good short term system and one I am soon going to add to my live trading.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I have Stoch 5,5,3 on the 15M and 5M , and just look for the general direction - if one of them (particularly 15M) looks like they are turning in the opposite direction of the cci - dictated trend then I stay out. A lot of the philosophy taken from Spud's MTF Stochastics Strategy. Probably just because its a heavily down-trending day, but there have been 5 +20 signals this morning in the last 4 hours - wish I had taken all of them...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
..but then again, if I took them all, i would have been breaking the very important 20 pip profit rule...

Hi Paulus, I've been mini trading with real, albeit small dollars. I'm only hitting about 30 percent profitable. Some of the low percentage is due to my entry errors - too early or too late. Anyway, I wondered if you could post some additional days trades - good and bad for me to study and compare to my entries and exits. If you could I'd appreciate it. The principles behind the strategy seems real solid to me. Thanks Lynn

The principles behind the strategy seems real solid to me. Thanks Lynn[/quote ] Posting your charts would be much more beneficial for you than asking Paulus to take the time to post his. That way you could get help from any number of traders using this system/strategy in perhaps seeing where your entry points and/or entry/exit times are 'incorrect' (?) Right now Paulus has an awful lot on his plate, and while I am sure he would love to take the time to help everyone individually, that's not one of his present options .

Hi Ib Il try but as Flameco says I have alot of personal issues right now things are better but these things take alot of time to resolve and that has to be my priority if I get time today I will post some hope it helps and thanks Flemenco for explaining in case I didnt get to see the post i appreciate it Iv had allot of email from guys asking if I can look at a system to use just on 1 time frame..I think its so that they can have several swaps open looking for signals ..with 2 time frame i guess its alot more confusing having several charts open, I went through my old futures systems and as you can guess by my posts I have alot of trading ideas in my head and have looked at most of them some more than others. One that showed great promise on futures may well work on Forex it works on 1 time frame I will post a chart in a min but wont give out the rules untill I have tested it for a week il do it on eurusd on the 5min time scale. If it is successful or shows any promise I will post template and chart with rules in FF but under a new thread the link to which I will place here. It is designed to take advantage of a trend and pick high probability set ups I would imagine you get around 12-15 signals a day So far today 3 signals

With this Forex Freedom Bars Indicator (which I found on another thread) you can have the 5 - 15 - 30 (I hide the 60M) CCI on one chart. It saves having to have 2 or more charts up, and is a real benefit for me. You have to change the values in the various times in the indicator to 8 (or 6 if you prefer) And yes - I don't have the Stoch on my charts. I also like to have the regular 5M CCI8 showing, even though it IS displayed on the Forex Freedom Indicator!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thanks Flamenco, I was looking for something like this.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I had a similar mtf CCI bar indicator, I think I got it from TSD. Anyway, it repainted, and gave false readings. Not saying this one does, but check it just in case. I have an mtf CCI meter if anyone wants it. It does the job well. PQ

--- 帖子 #255 ---
No - this one doesn't repaint. But unlike the CCI8 Histogram the newest bar doesn't form until the previous one closes. That's why I prefer to keep the CCI8 Histogram on my chart. It gives me a better 'heads-up' . But seeing the 15M &amp; 30M CCI is a very valuable visual tool!

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hey first time posting here, just want to say great system Paulus! thank you for sharing your system. Maybe this MTF CCI indicator can be of some help

Paulus, short note to say "thanks". I have followed another one of your treads and am grateful for eveything that you have taught me. The "Traffic Lights" system is easy to use and the concept behind the method is sound.... looking for a reversal of a "counter trend" back to the main trend. With a little practice on the timing of entries, and correct money management, it IS possible duplicate your success. Thanks again!

Ronald, What would be great is to have the CCI 8 that Paulus uses modified so that the 15m can be displayed in the 5m chart with the same +blue,-red look. That way we can have just have one chart open with the two CCI's stacked. Thanks, Bob

The major indicator you are comparing with the two time frames is the CCI8. I put both 5M &amp; 15M on my screen, and just delete the uneccessary indicator windows, and place the 15M under my 5M so just the CCI is showing. You can quickly confirm the 15M trend without taking up a lot of space.

Thanks Flamenco. Sometimes the simplest solution is right under our nose. We just automatically look for something more complicated. There's a reason they call it Windows. Thanks again, Bob By the way, I feel like your sig line right now.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Flamenco, Refer to your post 252 red arrows down &amp; yellow arrows up. what signal are they? Are they audio alert too? I would be appreciated if you post me this EA. Thank you, pete

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Here's an attachmnt. It's just a simple MA crossover alert I use to give me a heads-up that trend 'MAY' be changing. I believe I had the settings at 3 fast and 5 slow - weighted close. Alert on. It's NOT an EA! I've been trading for over 5 years and I will NEVER use an EA! 99% of em never work correctly. Check any thread where someone created an EA and the result are pages and pages of traders trying to get them working right. There were just times I have to get away from the monitor and get my eyeballs back into my head and this simple little MA crossover alert helps me,

Thank you Flamenco, Pete

Thanks for running with the thread guys we have a great community here..we all help each other it great Paulus

Hi! to have it all on one chart is this right ? one cci 8 on 5 minutes and one 24 cci on 5 minutes is there another update or is the system the same as on page one + best regards

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I use a 10 pip stop 10 pip tp I stop for the day when I have 20 clear pips This is too much noise for little profit method...

Boy Kevin- you have a lot to learn yet. That has GOT to be one of the most asinine statements ever!

Hi, Could someone please confirm what settings are you all working with on the Heiken Ashi. I have 2 6 3 2 is this right or not ? With Many Thanks David

Hi Paulus, Thanks for sharing your system it's good &amp; very simple I beleive it's very effective but I'm still losing(demo) bcos I always got in too early or may be too late (Patient is what I need) Again you are very great person even you are having personal problem but you still have time to guide us of your ideas &amp; expertise. That's is GREAT GREAT &amp; very GREAT. That's life Paulus we are all have to face it. I wish all best wish will come to you I lost every things with minius and right now 'me alone' but at least I paid my debt (it's took me few yrs). As I can see you still have time for this thread and yet you started another one 'sweet spot' so I'm sure you are handling it very well. For me right now I want only 12 pips a day (12pips only but still happy with 10 pips) to quit my 50-60 hrs/week job and going live in the country where the money spending is not big. I traded CFD australian shares for fews yrs but lost(not much). Later I found Forex trading and also FF - very interesting. So I've been doing demo for 10 mths now. And lately I found this thread and I read this thread about 2 times (some posts 3-4 times). So this thread must be good and have to give Yes this thread is very great community because of you're still here and we all also have to thank one more person "Flamenco who is always here to help us " Thank you for this thread, Pete

In the 5 mins. I use Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed_Alert (2,6,3,2) In the 15 mins. I use CCI 8 (8,1,0.618) Best regards !!!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi guys, Setting for Heiken Ashi smoothed is 0132 Please look at post#95 by Paulus By the way can anyone briefly tell me how to use this indicator(simple way)? Thanks, Pete

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I know, but I'm testing with other configuration. How to use?. What you talking about?. Greetings !!!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I'm assuming you're asking for more information on the HAS as an indicator? Generally - the HAS eliminates the clutter (noise) of normal candles, and indicates better (for the most part) continuing trends. Like 'normal' candles, the HAS gives you loads of information. Simply speaking, if there are no wicks on the bottom and/or long wicks on top of the blue HAS, that is a fairly good indication of a strong upward movement. Down trends (red HAS) indicates continuing strong downward movement when the HAS have no wicks on the top and/or long wicks on the bottom. Long bodies show strength of movement, short bodies volatility in that direction is decreasing and may be changing. And like 'usual' dojos, hammers, and Hanging Man, when you have wicks on the top AND the bottom you know market sentiment is changing. Sorry, I can't remember that much more about them right now. If you go back and look at charts you'll soon be able to pick out the patterns and identify potential market trend changes. Hope this helps a little.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi Ronald RayGun, I have been testing the Traffic Lights EA on the 5 min chart with better results. However, on the longer time frame, the trade trigger stays open until the next bar so that if a trade closes before the current bar ends another trade is immediately opened almost always resulting in a loss. I would like to code the EA to make the "SignalsOnly" automatically change to "true" when a trade is opened and then automatically change back to false at the start of the next bar (i.e., 1 trade only, per signal, per bar unless the trailing stop is enabled). It seems like statements as follows: if(Order = SIGNAL_BUY) SignalsOnly = true &amp; if(Order = SIGNAL_SELL) SignalsOnly = true placed strategically in the code would turn off order placement. And statement(s) like: newbar SignalsOnly = false placed strategically in the code would turn it back on. Keep in mind, I am not a programmer, I just dabble with the logic so I need help with the above and especially where to put it in the code. I am more than happy to do the keying and testing if it is acceptable to you. If not, I fully understand and one of your speedy updates would be great. Any help you may provide would be greatly appreciated! Your EA's are most impressive!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Do you mean to say one trade per bar?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi RR, Yes.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Done

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thank You So Much RR, In my mind, only an expert that knows this stuff like the back of his hand can perform these tasks with such lightning speed! This is a great forum/thread where one gets timely answers and problem solution. One of the best I have ever had the pleasure of participating in.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Thanks Flamenco, That's what I need. I'll study more detail in google

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi everyone, Yes this thread is very great community because of you(Paulus) are still here and we all also have to thank one more person "Flamenco who is always here to help us " Sorry I forgot one more person,it wasn't in my mind at that time(Sorry Ronald I hope you won't mind) - Programmer expert 'Ronald Raygun' , you're always here to help us( promptly &amp; sincerely ) with EA problems. Thank you Ronald Raygun And again Thank you for this thread, Pete[/quote]

A nice video you can see about HAS is at CompassFX. Sign up for the 'Synergy System' (but DON'T USE IT! It's a real loser in my experience with too many false break-outs) OR just down load the Synergy PDF file. (Shows the same thing as the video without the commentary. There's no committment to CompassFX by signing up.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Checking quickly at Compass FX I couldn't find the PDF download file. Here it is. As I previously mentioned, don't waste your time learning the system. It looks good, and the Trader's Dynamic Index is a fairly good indicator, but using the whole strategy didn't make any money for me. The only thing that has lately is Paulus's Traffic Light System. I'm sold and use it live successfully without any EA's to screw it up!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi Again RR, RE: One trade per bar Is there a way to do this without being limited to opening a trade in the last 10 seconds of the bar? That option is already available by setting EachTickMode to False. Correct? Is there a way to count the number of trades PER BAR? If so, logic could be added to the TradeTrigger sequence to trade only when the count = 0. (By the way, I see now where MY original idea was flawed.) As always, any help you may provide is much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
EachTickMode waits for the bar to close. My main concern given the scalping nature of this system is that the current candle is constantly changing which means it may give a signal, then not give a signal. I've seen plenty of my scalping EAs whipsawed out of the market when something like that happens. Paulus I think mentioned the "open 10 sec to bar close" rule, and to me it makes sense, the bar generally does not change color 10 sec to its close.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi RR, I agree with your logic using the 1 min TF. The problem I'm experiencing on the 5 min is basically none exsistent on the 1 min because the bar almost always closes before the trade. However, on the 5 MIN TF, if the signal occurs early in the bar, the scalping opportunity is gone well before a trade would be entered (waiting for the last 10 seconds of the bar). Based on my testing, there are just too few signals that "start" within the 10 second window. If you don't get in when the signal first occurs, you loss more than win. My original intent was to code the EA so that a second trade would not be automatically entered if the first one closed before the bar closed. I guess I don't see how this would be a negative issue since, based on my testing, the second trade almost always ends up a loss. However, if you believe this would cause more problems than benefits, I respect your opinion.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Try it. Just remember to post your results here.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
RR, Thank you once again for the prompt response. I will definitely post results, good or bad. I am working for a more profitable EA for all of us.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
RR, RE: One Trade Per Bar The "Trade Taken This Bar" function is not working. Forgive me for my inexperience in this area, but 2 questions. How does the program know there has been a trade from the expression... "if(TradeCount == Bars) TradeTaken = "Yes"";? Am I missing something elsewhere in the code? And Shouldn't the... "TradeTaken == "Yes"" expression in the TradeTrigger sequence read..."TradeTaken == "No"" to open a trade, then if TradeCount actually equals "Yes" before the current bar closes, no trade is opened?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Good catch, yes I had it backwards.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
RR, RE: One Trade Per Bar The "Trade Taken This Bar" function is still not working. I am still getting a second trade on the same bar. The "No" on the platform screen never changes to "Yes" after the first trade has been entered or closed. I refer to my first question in the earlier post: How does the program know there has been a trade from the expression... "if(TradeCount == Bars) TradeTaken = "Yes";"? Am I missing something elsewhere in the code? Should there not be something in the code that assigns the actual trade count to the variable "TradeCount"? Please give some detail on this so I can understand the logic. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Here is what is supposed to happen. TradeTaken starts as "No", TradeCount is 0. When a trade is taken, TradeCount is set equal to bars. Until a bar passes, TradeTaken stays "Yes".

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thanks Flamenco for pdf file &amp; I'll follow your advice. Forgive me to look at your profile you are Flamenco guitarist WOW you must be very good guitarist because flamenco style - the sound of one person playing is equivalent to 3 person playing at the same time. Thanks pete

--- 帖子 #306 ---
RR, RE: One Trade Per Bar The "Trade Taken This Bar" function is still not working. I am still getting a second trade on the same bar. The "No" on the platform screen never changes to "Yes" after the first trade has been entered or closed. Your explanation was very helpful. I did not see where "TradeCount" was set equal to 0, so I tried that. It didn't work. Maybe I didn't handled it properly. Could this be the problem? Any ideas? I would like to get this functioning. Cuz I think it will help the cause.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I'm not sure what's causing it, and what's worse is that I can't recreate the problem. The best fix for now is to run with EachTickMode set to false.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hello, Very nice thread. Thank you very much Paulus and all others. I have a question about the settings. First, about Heiken Ashi Smoothed, what settings are we using for MA Method, MA Period, MA Method2 and MA Period2 ??? Also about CCI, we should use CCI with period = 8 applied to Typical price??? Or should we just use the CCI8 indicator posted in this thread??? Are they the same with just visual changes??? What about using CCI 24 in the 5M chart so that it works as the CCI8 in the 15M but without having to have 2 charts open? I know someone mentioned about it allready but I couldnt see if anyone posted the results. Anyway, is there anyway that we can check CCI in both 5m and 15m in the same chart???? Congratulations for the great thread and thanks in advance for the help. Cheers, Dudu

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi Dudu before I answer I think I owe a big thanks you to Ronaldraygun ..the work he does on this and other thereads is immense and boards like this couldnt function without him.A big thanks mate I may not post an aweful lot once the thread gets going but all the hard work from you and others is appreciated I assure you MaMetod 0 MaPeriod 1 MaMetod 3 MaMetod 2 On my CCI8 all I have is CCI period 8 T3 Period 1 B 0.618 CCI 24 is put on the 5min chart with settings 24 and if above 0.00 look for longs below 0.00 look for shorts its almost identical to the CCI8 on the 15min. Hope that helps Paulus

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thanks Paulus, Will start demoing ur system from today.... Looks really good and I agree completely about the 20 pips/day and then its over..... Low exposure = higher chances of profit. Good MM and leverage will do the rest. About EA's I dont use them. I really do enjoy and prefer trading manually but of course recognize the value of EA's for those who have a day job. Again I thank you ALL for the excellent thread. May the Lord of the Pips be with You all, lol Cheers

to long time seens anyone posted here several days i have a question what time is is 7am to 11am and 2.30 pm to 5 pm in GMT + 1 time ?? best regards

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I could be wrong, but I think that Paulus is in the London time zone (which is currently GMT + 1). Yes, thread has not had a lot of activity lately. But I use the system each day with great interest. I still find myself making mistakes (sometimes I fall victim to "head fakes"), but each day I get a little better. Hopefully the thread will become more active in the future.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
yes but what are this in GMT + 1 7am to 11am and 2.30 pm to 5 pm in GMT + 1 time ?? best regards

ill probbly try this system in the near future. Thanks for sharing Cheers!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Great trades cfp85. I wanted to find them on my charts and see how they set up etc to continue my learning. Can you give me a reference to the time. I assume the times shown are your broker's server time. Also were you trading with a TF of 5 minutes. Thanks Lynn

--- 帖子 #319 ---
here it is .. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1st trade was a bit risky since still no trend confirmation from 30m. so i took a small TP .. used the Close All ea .. easier . just make the trade and it will set the tp,sl,ts. 2nd and 3rd trade .. all three TF have the same CCI bar color and stoich pointing down

I am very happy with Paulus Post espacialy his System EOD and i want to start reading this thread Trafic light since this thread very long, Is there some hint to begin .. Is first post "system" still valid or had update ??

--- 帖子 #323 ---
i wondering why this method lack of posts ..

--- 帖子 #324 ---
system still valid but having to move away from intra day trading for personal reasons. Paulus

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I'd be interested in peoples results recently with this system. There have been some high/low 50 pip+ 5 minute candles. With the market being so volatile, maybe 10 pip SL is too small.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Paulus, That is a interesting system, it's very thanks for your sharing, keep trading simply. Look forward your future sharing, thanks~ p.s. sorry for my poor English, it is not my nature language......

--- 帖子 #327 ---
By request of a number of members on this forum, I've included a time-function in this EA.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Please how can I install it on my EA? and can I get a manual to understand how it works?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
It seems that the posts here have dropped to about one per month now. Is everyone busy trading it and making money, or just lost interest in it? Did the market conditions change so much that it is not profitable anymore?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
PD I still use it and I am still adapting it here is the latest traffic light not traded in the Asian session though HA gone When we get all 4 on CCI blue long red short 1st signal this morning The red and blue dots are nonlagdotMS a none repainting version of this great indicator Close would be 1st red sqaure on any time frame or 1st red dot the SL is the same this signal although extreme I admit made $1416 its an on going project Paulus

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Paulus, I have been following Traffic Lights for a few weeks now and I think it's a robust method. I see you have added the 1 hr CCI as well now. Can you please post your latest template for us following the thread here? This would be very much appreciated. Many thanks for your help. Bakuli

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Paulus I have searched and found the indicators that you are using but can you tell us the settings you are using please. Thanks. Regards, Bakuli

--- 帖子 #333 ---
hi paulus can u post indicators and ur tpl . thanks

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Paulus, I am also interested in testing the revised indicators. Have they been posted on this thread? If so, which post. If not, would you please post them. Thanks in advance! BigE!

--- 帖子 #335 ---
If you like the Traffic Lights method, then you'd be interested in this one too. Very similar except the additional use of a stochastic indicator. Also you'll find the multi CCI indicator (that Paulus uses) in that thread but you may have to change the period setting to what Paulus uses here. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=110429

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Nice one Paulus, what are the settings of CCI's in diferent timeframes? Are they all, the same? 8? Thanks Paulus for your systems and trading ideas..

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Before I give these setting I need a bit of an unbiased test.. the system is run on a 1min chart Can some one give me a pair and a date on what they think was a bad day and or a day they may have found tricky hard or un profitable..can you also give me the £ per pip please If I have the data available on 1min I will check results if Im happy with the results which i will post here I will give out settings and latest template.I dont want any one wasting thier time sprinting down a blind alley .. paulus

hi, can someone use iCustom to make an audio alert of RSI-Signal.ex4?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
just started using somewhat the same system paulus just posted in previous page I'm using the same nonlagdot indi that flamenco posted on page 4. I changed the TF to M1 like paulus, and I changed the nonlagdot length setting from 30 to 10. im just experimenting right now. so far, i need help finding how to check the closing point of a given point on the graph (on MT4), could somebody please show me how to find this?? the two indi's im experimenting with right now are posted below. use at your own risk lol as i'm waiting for some good settings from paulus... Attached File(s) 1freedombars.mq4 9 KB | 401 downloads Attached File(s) 1nonlagdot.mq4 5 KB | 632 downloads edit: dont know why attachments arent showing up like everyone else's lol, but hopefully this has same function edit2: changed freedombars CCIs to 8 for all TFs, maybe it gives a mor accurate depiction of trend

--- 帖子 #205 ---
You might want to try the non repaint version of the FF bars. I haven't used this in a long time, but might be good with the nonlag dots.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
BenQ, I tried out your Forex Freedom Bars. Only thing I change was all the time frames(5,15,30,60) to CCI 8. Looks promising Paulus. $1000(demo 1 std lot)in 34 minutes promising. Before this run I had a few whipsaw losses around 8:30 when direction was trying to make up it's mind. But this run made up for it. Thanks reese777

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I looked at my own picture, and saw 2 lots. Ok, 2 lots not 1. Please Excuse.

Could someone please put the mtf cci indicator with completion ex4? Mq4 me not low thanks

I think I like the HA vs better.. will play with this. Lets keep this thread going.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Why? Its not profitable.

Hi Paulus/everyone I was wondering if anyone traded or is trading with profit the -10/+20 pips variation of this system that Paulus tested in Sept. 2008. Can you confirm? Thank you. And Paulus, thanks for your simple systems. L.S.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Yeowie!!! Just loaded up the EA today. Fired off 12 buy trades, all losing, in about ten seconds. And they should have been short trades. Mine is a 5 digit broker, I think that may have something to do with it. Added a zero to all SL's andTP's and that seemed to fix that problem. Since then I've had one winning trade and am in the middle of a losing trade at the moment. Which seemed to have got me in too early I feel. Anyway early days. I really want this EA to work. I will perceiver. [ Whoops that trade just went belly up. ] woofx

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi, Does anyone have a template and a complete set of inidicators / ea's for this method along with some up to date instructions as I would like to get this tested? Cheers FWLoop
