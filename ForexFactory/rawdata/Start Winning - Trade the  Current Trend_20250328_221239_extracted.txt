UPDATE 27 NOV 16 In the short time that this thread has been active there has been a lot of ideas for improvement and subsequent changes to the template. I will not completely re-write this post as the information contained below stiill forms the foundation of what the system was built on. The rules and templates that were posted on day 1 are still viable for profitable trading. Page 12 is the point that the new template started to take shape but to fully understand what is going on here anyone new to the thread must read everything that has been posted to date. I do not want to have to waste time by explaining again what can easily be answered by reading the first few pages. Here is the new template as I have it. I have included RSI candles (period 8) but whether you use them or not is personal preference - I don't use them. If you do use them then you can drop the RSI Custom Indicator if you want. V1 = 3 RSI and RSI custom in seperate windows. V2 = 3 RSI overlaying RSI custom. These are in the zip folder. There is one for each TF. TF Templates = Templates with correct indicatorsetting forvarious Time Frames.

No Trolls - I don't know how to ban anyone but if I need to and I can, I will. 2. I am not an expert, but I have learned a thing or two. Give the thread a chance and if it is not for you please move on. 3. I believe that even the most experienced can still learn (even from those less exerienced). 4. My goal here is to develop this trading method for my own use and also to help some struggling traders if I can. 5.This thread is not intended to teach brand new traders the basics of trading so do your homework first. 6. I do not stick to traditionally accepted rules of money management and I will not discuss this aspect of trading. We are all responsible for our own profits and losses.

The 10 EMA (blue solid) should be below the 10 of 10EMA (pink solid) (M5 TF). Let 3 RSI cross above 50 line and enter short when it crosses back below 50. CONDITIONS FOR LONG ENTRIES The HTF 10EMA (Green dotted) should be above the HTF 10 of 10 EMA (orange dotted) line. The 10 EMA (blue solid) should be above the 10 of 10 EMA (pink solid) (M5 TF) Let 3 RSI cross below 50 line and enter long when it crosses back above 50. SHORT TRADE OPPORTUNITIES - EXAMPLE The chart below shows you AUDUSD M5 for today and yesterday. From the time when the H1 10EMA first crossed below the 30LWMA at the yellow square you will see that to this date it has not yet crossed above. THIS MEANS DO NOT BUY - WE WANT TO BE SELLERS. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is GBPJPY M5 - these are buying conditions - HTF 10 EMA is above HTF 30 LWMA. These conditions mean we want to be buyers. Attached Image (click to enlarge) STOP LOSS AND TAKE PROFIT Where to put your SL and TP is a decision for yourself based on your risk appetite and how much drawdown you are willing to accept in order to end up with a profitable trade. I went through a period of unwillingness to accept a loss and of course that resulted in losing in the end. All this achieved was to induce undue stress and loss of money. Now I always use a SL. If I am scalping the M5 TF I place my SL below the 30 LWMA and move it up or down accordingly as price moves in the right direction. I don't care too much if I take a loss because there will be plenty winners. I don't normally use a TP. INDICATORS 1. Moving Averages - freely available to all in MT4 or other platform. 2. RSI - Again freely available. All I have done is add a couple of coloured boxes to highlight the OS and OB levels. 3. Volume Candles. Taken from PVSRA thread. To understand volume, which I recommend, please go to one of those threads. You can find a pdf called "PVSRA". I highly recommend it. 4. I use a MA cross indicator to alert me of possible opportunities when I am out and about and working. I DONT TRADE THE CROSS. I TRADE THE PULLBACK.

F@ck Ranging markets. We don't aim to trade ranging markets. If we get caught up in them, we make the best of it (win or lose) and crack on. Even H1 ranging markets can be very profitable on M5. Tomorrow I will continue.

Hi wizlon, Good thread. Keep it simple - few rules, simple rules to follow and make trading decisions. There is a trend in every timeframe we look at. We must all learn to trade that trend of that moment. Good Trading. Attached Image

Last night I may have had a glass of wine too many (tough week at work) so I am glad to see that the thread actually makes sense so far. I do want to make something clear though - I am not looking to enter trades when the current TF 10 EMA crosses the 30 MWMA. I want to wait for a pullback and enter when the 3 RSI confirms things. Now the 3 RSI is a fickle beast and it will turn on a dime but I think it helps me to enter at the right time and not jump the gun. Now of course you can use this method without the 3 RSI if you want. All it is really telling you is that there is a little pullback and that you now have a candle going in the right direction for your trade. You can see that by looking at the candles alone. I just find that it is easier to use the 3 RSI as confirmation. The chart below is USDCAD M5. This shows you some entries that you could have taken yesterday using this system. Personally I use the M5 TF for scalping. I can make just as much, if not more money by intraday scalping than by trying to hold my position. Once your pips are banked the robbers can't steal it back (unless you let them)! Point to note here is that I am only looking for long entries because the HTF MAs are telling me that the H1 trend is up! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This post is to explain why I am using the 10EMA with the 30 LWMA. I was playing around with some Moving Averages to try to find a good combination that would help me to trade the short term swings and I ended up settling with the 10 EMA with a 10 EMA applied to it. This gave gave me a nice smooth combination that I liked (in my opinion it is even better than the 10EMA with 30 LWMA). Because I work full time I trade and monitor trades on my phone through the day. Because of that I miss loads of brilliant trading / money making opportunities. So I use an indicator that alerts me when my 2 MAs cross and it will not acccept my prefered combination. There for I looked for an MA that was as close to my 10 EMA of a 10 EMA as possible and I came up with the 30 LWMA (I will add some indicators to post 1 shortly). Here is a chart showing my prefered combination and also with the 30 LWMA applied. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

H1 Trading and H4 Direction This method will work equally as well on higher TF. If you prefer to hold trades longer the H1 and H4 combination could be good. This chart is EURUSD H1. The dotted lines show the position of the H4 10 EMA and 30 LWMA. We can see that we want to be sellers. Using the same principles as above we can enter on pullbacks. This time you can see that it wouls be better to enter when the 3 RSI leaves Over-Bought levels. Here's the maths - H4 = 4 x H1. 4 x 10 EMA = 40 EMA (green dotted). 4 x 30 LWMA = 120 LWMA. Simples!

Here is an idea I have for an RSI Dashboard. It is just something that I am trialling but I think it could be good - we will see. When RSI 14 is below the 50 level price is bearish / going down. When 14 RSI is above the 50 level price is Bullish / going up. When the 14 RSI is above 50 (Bullish) and the 3 RSI crosses above 50 from below, these could be ideal conditions to look to be a buyer. When the 14 RSI is below 50 (Bearish) and the 3 RSI crosses below 50 from above, these could be ideal conditions to look to be a seller. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is how the Dashboard would look like for 1 currrency pair. The bottom row shows whether the 14 RSI is above (green) or below (red) the 50 level. The row above that shows whether the 3 RSI is above (green) or below 50 (red) the 50 level. The arrows on top show the current direction of the 3 RSI. When 14 RSI is bearish and 3 rsi has retraced to bullish levels it may be wise to assume that price is still bearish overall. When the arrow turns red and we get a red top and bottom we need to get ready for a short entry as the 3 RSI crosses below 50. Opposite for long entries. Here we have a H4 Bull Sandwich (possible long opportunity on H4). Attached Image The ideal signal to look to be a buyer would be -Green Bottom Light. Red Top Light. Blue Arrow. I call this a Bull Sandwich for ease. The ideal signal to look to be a seller would be -Red Bottom Light. Green Top Light. Red Arrow. I call this this a Bear Sandwich for ease. The bottom row of lights shows the main trend on each TF. The top row of lights shows the short term pullback on each TF. The arrow is the current 3 RSI direction. Each TF on the dashboard can be used individually. I will say again that this is just something that I am trialling. Here is a possible full dashboard. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here are the indicators and the template I use. Initially the setting may look a little strange but they work so that when I shrink the window down they all line up nicely.

sir . can you send All template . RSI ' Dash .tpl ' only EURAUD . not other currency Thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Just go in to the indicator inputs tab and type the relevant pair. I have the Dashboard for each currency pair in its own chart. Mainly because I did not have the time to put all of the indicators on 1 chart and fiddle with the settings to make sure they were all where I wanted them to be. Also you will notice than I did not include the Majors on the screenshot above. That is because I monitor them seperatly -they are my primary pairs to trade because the spreads are low. If I can't find anything to trade on the Majors then I look at some other pairs. If anyone has time to arrange a decent dashboard that can be used on 1 chart that would be good.

Busy day at work today but still managed a couple of trades on my phone. The main trade worth reporting was EURUSD Short. I was initially alerted to the trade possibility by the MA cross alert indicator. I looked at my phone and took the trade based on the H1 TF. I took 5 entries in all and closed them all way too soon. Average 20 pips approx. Explanation is on the chart. Hope it all makes sense. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Regarding what I said about having to use the 30 LWMA just so Ican use the MA Cross Alerts Indicator - I realised that I can still use the 10EMA of a 10 EMA on my charts but still use the 30 LWMA for the alerts. Which also means that the HTF MAs can also be what I would prefer them to be, which is; M5 chart - 120 EMA (green dotted) = 10EMA on H1 - This is no change. 120 EMA (orange dotted) applied to previous 120 EMA = 10 EMA of 10EMA on H1. H1 chart - 40 EMA (green dotted) = 10 EMA on H4. 40 EMA (orange dotted) applied to previous 40 EMA = 10EMA of 10 EMA on H4. I will amend post 1

Here is USDCAD H1. I want to use this chart to further explain my thinking concerning the 14 and how I apply it to my chart and trading. I did briefly describe this above but I said that I do not include the 14 RSI because the MAs on the chart show me pretty much the same info. 14 RSI above 50is Bullish.14 RSI Below 50is Bearish. I am going to include the 14 RSI for the time being just to help to get my point accross and hopefully to assist any learning. But the thing is I don't actually have the 14 RSI visible as such - I use a 5 Smothed MA of it. The reason is because I don't actually care too much about the actual current direction that it is heading. I care about whether it is above or below 50 and I don't want to put off if it looks like it might head to the other side. I will know that the trend has reversed when the MAs and PA tell me. This chart shows what I am talking about and basically I set the 14 RSI colour to "none". Attached Image (click to enlarge)

NZDJPY H1 Trade 25 pips approx. Reason for trade -I initially looked at the pair after seeing my NJ RSI Dash. I could see that all lights and arrows on H4 and D1 were green, telling me that the HTF trend was up. M5 and M15 were all red indicating a LTF pullback. H1 was displaying what I called a Bull sandwich above in a previous post. (needs a better name) so I entered the trade when H1 3 RSI crossed above the 50 line. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Here is another example of the Dashboard. It is USDCHF. The chart TF is H1. Ignore the arrows for now - as I said above somewhere the 3 RSI can turn on a dime so I think it may be best to only consider the arrow once you identify an opportunity i.e a bull /bear sandwich on a specific TF. Basically though this shows you that you probably want to be trading long. You can see thaat there is a LTF pullback starting because the LTF lights are turning red. I am not saying that this will turn in to a good trading opportunity, but it could. I am not monitoring this, I just wanted to post it as an example. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Was watching this and suddently it dropped about 50 pips in 1 M5 candle. I was just considering looking for a short as the HTF (H1) MAs were crossing and all looked ready on M5 but I wasn't quick enough and missed it. But the point is that I noticed it because of the template. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Here is GU 5 Pip Mean Renko Chart with my template including volume candles. I think this looks very interesting. Entries could be taken using the method that I have already laid out. But also I think we could get much much simpler entries using a very tight SL. When the MAs are telling us to go either long or short and we get a high volume bar agreeing with that direction, enter the trade. SL placed as close as possible but just allowing enough room for 1 Bar above/below entry bar + spread and then possible trail above or below one ofthe MAs. Anyway it is just an idea at this stage and I will check it out and share my results. By the way, feel free to comment on anything and get involved - I see a lot of downloads of my templates but no participation yet. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If anyone is interested here is the EA I use to create the Renko Charts, although for all I know there may be better ones available here on FF.

Excellent Thread. Been watching and trying to get my head around the Trade Management Architecture (Entries, Stops and Profits). Finding that I am missing several good Entries by missing the RSI Crosses. Would be great to have an Indicator providing an alarm whenever these crosses occur:- RSI3 crossing RSI14; and RSI3 breaking out of overbought/oversold zones. I like the H1 setups; and perhaps will take a look at H4 setups later-on. Here is a beautiful EURGBP Setup that I just missed. There were two opportunities and I missed them both Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have added a Support and Resistance Indicator (freely available on FF) to the Chart to guide me on possible Exit Zones. I have attached the indicator in the event anyone has an interest. Attached File(s) SS_SupportResistance_v04c original mod.ex4 18 KB | 481 downloads Trade well.

Thanks for your input Krismitt! Glad to have you on board mate. You have a slightly different take I think. i.e you are using the RSIs crossing as your signal (where as I am using the 3 RSI crossing the 50 level). No problem with that at all. I will be honest and say that I have not been using this system for long so I am am happy for it to evolve if it improves the system. However I will say that the reason I did not use the RSIs crossing is that for the way I described the system, to go short the 14 RSI would be below the 50 level so the 3 RSI would cross below 50 before it crosses the 14 RSI. But that said, I see how you are using it and it works. Well done on your trades!!

EURGBP short - H1 Scalp Trade. I am also showing M5 just so we can see what was going on in the H1 candle. Reason for trade - I like the look of the MAs and Price Action at the top of the swing. I got 16 pips from that one which may not seem like much but by increasing the volume I don'tneed to make a massive number of pips to make good profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A bit more on the Renko Charts. This is EURUSD 5 Pip Mean Renko. The MAs are the same as the M5 template. We can see that the HTF MAs are indicating that the trend is down so we would be looking for shorts. The vertical blue lines indicate certain bearish renko bars. I say bearish bars because they are down bars. The bars that the lines mark are the bars where the 3 RSI also crossed below the 50 line from above. The bearish renko bars compliment the RSI cross and can act as extra confirmation. I have looked at a few charts and this happens a lot. Also for long trades with Bullish Bars.

The right chart is the chart I posted above. The left chart is EURUSD M5 candlestick chart. Very similar but I like the Renko Volume bar confirmation. Personally I have a small Renko chart and 2 Higher TF charts visible alongside my main chart. I will post my screen set up next. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is my screen setup. This is AUDUSD but I save each pair as it's own profile so I can switch easily between them. I also have an overview profile which I use to look at several pairs at once. And Ihave my RSI Dash profile. The HTF MAs (dotted) on the 2 HTF charts are configured for the next higher time frame 10EMA and 10 of previous 10EMA. Maybe a bit much for some people but it works for me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I just found your method and have been back-trading... so far it does find many good entries, and it's great to find this new approach using MA's. I only look at MA's when ADX says the trend is strong and the MA's align in proper order showing trend strength. You've got me valuing MA's more... I do find that using the RSI as a constraint for finding entries can sometimes make for lost good opportunities. If the 120MA lines support it, do you ever enter when the 10MA lines cross? Also, I find your color scheme is hideous...heh...I'll make my own....heh

--- 帖子 #39 ---
The colour scheme took me about 2 seconds - I didn't really put any thought in to it and it might not be the prettiest. But the only colour that matters is the colour of the Pips and this system produces many green ones! As to your question on entering when the MAs cross; personally I do not take that as an entry signal in itself. An MA cross with supporting price action and the RSIs in agreement then yes maybe. The way I have described entries is what I consider to be the safest method and if done correctly will create winning trades with minimum draw down at the beginning of the trade. Now how and when you or I enter the market may differ greatly but we enter our trades based on our experience. I am conscious that many new traders study these threads and they may not have the experience that you might have. Is the 3 RSI a constraint? No I don't think so. Often it will cross the 50 level before the MAs cross. Also there is also the possibility of entering when it crosses back above or below the 10,30,70 and 90 levels.

As more traders are starting to participate I think it might be a good time to say this; I have put a lot of my time and effort in to putting this system together and I want it to stay as it is. Of course there is room for improvement but I know what can happen in these system threads - they can become ultra-polluted with all sorts of mind boggling indicators and ideas. If you are going post charts, trades and ideas please stick to the system / template that I have provided. If you want to change the colours of your indicators then that is fine. If you don't like the blue and maroon boxes in the RSI window then remove them. But do not start adding your own indicators IF THEY CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF THE SYSTEM . If you have an idea for an additional indicator then please show and explain your idea and I will consider it. Thank you.

AUDJPY H4. Possible Opportunity. Only opened the chart after checking my RSI Dashboard. Although the Daily chart looks a bit stretched so it may need a larger pullback. Sorry,was looking at wrong daily chart due to a technical error. However i just wanted to showitas an example of the RSI Dash. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Looking at your chart at ( Post #23) the "first opportunity", if you were at your screen and saw it, could you have concluded that maybe because the pink line in the RSI window was flat that you would pass on it. Now, the 2nd opportunity looks the same except that now that same pink line is starting to fall, and then so does the price, making for a cleaner trade. The same approach could be used for longs; looking for the pink line to be moving up as further confirmation. I guess I would have to see more examples.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Ictrader11, Welcome. I refer you to post 17 where I explain the use of the pink RSI line. it does not matter if it is flat. it is actually a smoothed moving average so it can be flatish much of the time.what matters is whether it is above Or below the 50 level.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I took the AUDJPY trade when I posted it earlier. Not much movement so far but it's in profit. I am going to hold on to the trade for now but I don't know what will happen from here so I have moved my SL to prevent it from becoming a loser. Edit: SL hit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GU -Quick Renko Scalp. Reason for trade 1. HTF MAs bearish. 2. Bullish pullback towards HTF MAs with 3 RSI reaching very OB levels (over 90). 3. 14 RSI below 50 level. 4. 3 drops from OB levels and crosses below 50 line. 5. Red volume candle adds confluence. I closed the trade right after I took the screenshot and banked a few more green pips.

While studying your strategy, I saw you posted this trade. I felt comfortable enough to understand it and agreed with you, so I entered from the perspective of a 4H chart (can't watch constantly due to work/job). Coming back to the chart, I see your post and my profit margin. I just moved my SL for a guaranteed 12 PIP win and I'm watching as well to see how much I can get out of it. I've now moved to watch from the 15M chart. Thx for this simple approach!

Thanks for your response to that idiot. He is now banned from this thread. The funny thing is that I checked his profile and his trade explorer is visible - he is not exactly what you would call a good trader. If he had just given some time to learn this method he may have learned something useful. His loss.

Good stuff jcat. Really glad it's working for you. Please feel free to share some of your trades with an explanation.

Well done mate. Same goes to you and everyone -feel free to post some charts.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I don't do anything special, I used your system. I did add a stochastic, and used it for divergence. However, I am seeing the same divergence on the RSI 3, so it may be that I can take off the Stochs. This is the E/U chart. I did not take all of these trades, but I did take 3 of them. The RSI 3 going back below 50 (turns red on my chart) is a great place to get in. I enter 1 pip below that candle. All of the "checks" I put on my chart would have been good trades 10+ pips. The green X, would have gone positive, also, but my 1 pip below the last candle entry, wouldn't have let me take it, AND you can see the RSI 3 turns back to green. (again the trade goes positive pips). The other indicator I added is the RSI color bar at the bottom. That is my RSI 14. Very clear whether it is over 50 or below. It says "45 and 55" but it is adjustable.

Thanks for your chart and explanation. To me your template looks almost unrecognisable. I can see that yours basically has the same indicators as me but I find it quite hard to read. If we all use the same template it will make things much easier. I hope you understand. Please refer to post 40. This is not an ego thing on my part. I genuinely want this thread to proceed with us all singing off the same page and the template is essential for that in my opinion. However I do quite like your 14 RSI colour indicator. But stochastic wil rob your money

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Understood, the less confusion the better. I set up my RSI 3 with the Histogram, because it was easier for me to read. I tried 30 min charts today, with the HTF MA as 4 hr (multiplied them up with your math). 30 min and 4 hr go together well. Caught 2 big moves on the swissy/yen. Whatever the combo you came up with, works. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Wizlon, Would you be kind enough to explain the steps involved to get the dashboard onto the chart as you have shown.Been trying with the template you have posted but on applying the RSI template the chart disappears and only the dashboard is seen.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Welcome ckselvan. No problem. I will upload the template for you soon. Edit: Here it is. Just remember to go in to the both of the MTF RSI Dashboard indicators and change the settings to match the chart you are looking at. The other indicator has an option to work only on the current pair (and you can't change the colours) so you shouldn'thave to alter that one unless you want to move it.

Thanks for your understanding. And well done for trying different TF and MA combinations! I was looking at M5 with the 30 minute MAs yesterday which also looked ok. As you have pointed out, this works on any TF. You could even use HTF MAs of Timeframes that do not come with MT4 as standard. Maybe H2 or H6. I haven't got that far yet though. I am currently working on something else which will be the icing on the cake. The best bit of all. Once lots of us have managed to grasp the basics and starts winning with the system regularly I will share my idea.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
As you will have noticed I also use volume and volume candles in my own trading. I am not even close to being an expert in volume analysis but I know enough to give me an insight as to that the big money players might be up to. I recommended a pdf in post 1 called PVSRA. This is not a PVSRA thread but I would consider the knowledge that I gained from that pdf (and from studying some of those threads) to be right up there in terms of importance to my trading. Out of respect for those threads and those who have taken the time, and are still taking the time to teach PVSRA I am not going to upload the pdf here but I am taking the time to recommend it again because it is worth it. It is not required for this system because this system it is not based in any way on volume analysis, but if you want to grow as a trader it is worth looking for and studying.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
No problem you are not bothering me. I take it you have got the RSI dashboard indicators in your indicators folder and not in a sub folder? if you have them in a sub folder you need to copy them to the main indicator folder. Also go into the 14RSI properties and change the colour to none.

GU H1 possible short opportunity H4 looks mixed though RSI window says possible sell. HTF MAs say we may still be long. Personally I like the look of the short trade but you never know. Wait for the signal.

Hi Wizlon, Excellent thread you have here. Just started following it and I'm trying to get my charts/profiles set up. Quick question regarding the MA cross alerts indicator. Which MAs do you have the alerts set on for both the M5 and H1 charts? From reading your previous posts it looks like you have on the M5 an alert set for 10EMA crossing the 30LWMA (nearest eqivalent to 10EMA of 10EMA). Is that correct and is it the same for the H1 chart? Do you have any alerts set for the HTF MAs crossing or just use the dashboard for trend direction? Thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yes your maths is right.but that was a couple of days ago. This screen shot taken just now on my phone is for the purpose of promoting my system. I started with just 60 at the beginning of the week for your info. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Not quite sure what you mean. I think you might mean how do you set up the MA cross alerts. Is that right?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hello and welcome. All I do is set alerts for my M5 charts. if I get an alert I check the higher TFS. you are right about the 10 EMA and 30 lwma. A point for everyone - when I said earlier that I looked at GBPUSD because I got an alert, it was actually a buy cross on M5. my analysis told me not to buy but to look for a sell instead

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi what is the EMA calculation for 15min Chart ? (EMA and LWMA) Thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
You mean for the HTF MAs? Depends which TF trend you want to be aware of at a glance. H1 = 4 x M15, 4 x 10 EMA = 40 EMA, 4 x 10 of 10 EMA = 40 of previous 40 EMA. same as H1 and H4 Or do you mean for the alerts? same as M5 I suppose.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Dear wizlon32 Is it possible to show a picture of your alert setting (ma_cross_alert_once_b)?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Yes but not now. maybe someone else who is using the indicator successfully can help. If not then I will when I can

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Yes thanks. I mean alerts. how?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Which MT4 program do you use to produce your push notifications on your cell phone ? Is it "ma_cross_alert_once_b" or some other program ? In my opinion, "ma_cross_alert_once_b" produces only an email text message and not a chart as you showed in post #85. If there is some source code available for MT4 for the push notification, I could look into it to see if it is possible, to produce your preferred indicator cross over alert. (10 ema with the 10 of 10 ema).

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Yes that indicator does send push notifications. that is the only alerts indicator that I use. I think I only have the. exe file bit I will check.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Try a Google search. if you still haven't worked it out by Monday ask again. That really is me done now for the week ad I am nearly home!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Good week end.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
For those who need the alerts. This is a two step process depending on what you are wanting. If you are wanting the chart pop up alert then you set the indicator panel cross alert setting to true. This will give you a screen alert ad sound alert. If you just want the sound than you will need to set the sound option to true, this will just give you sound and no pop screen alert. If you want the push and/or the email alerts then you will need to set those functions to true in the indicator panel as step one. Then you need to go to your chart program and do step two. You will go to tools, options and then notifications for the push alert. You will also need to download the phone app and enter your phone info. For the email alert you will go to tools, options and then email. You will need to enter your email information for the alerts. Once you do all that you can close and restart the program and you should be good to go. You can have any combination of the alerts that you want. They do give you different information, the email is the most detail, the pop up and push are basic buy price/sell price and time. Again there is no indication on the chart itself with this indicator. This is a simple cross indicator of two ma's up or down. If you want to replicate the second ma which is the 10 of the 10 then you could set the second setting period to 15, close and shift 2. This will not be exact but will pretty darn close to what you want without doing any recoding.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks, but I solved by inserting the values of moving averages that I wanted to meet. Now I buy an arrow at the intersection as notification on your mobile phone. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thank you for taking the time to post your explanation.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I did not want to post any more today but i saw this post and i feel that i need to. It is not as simple as buying or selling when you see an arrow appear. Please take the time to study the thread and understand the system. Start small and build as you get better. Remember the MA cross indicator is not part of the system. All it does is alert you to potential opportunities when you cant be at your computer. It is a means to allow you to have your freedom but still trade effectively. As krismitt would day...Trade Safe.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Â I read everything. the alarm serves only as a warning not like signal.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi Wizlon, Great to see you've got an interesting thread going. I'm going to give your system a try. I have my own methods I use, but so far I haven't ventured into the 5 minute arena.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hey profitkeeper. I would love to have you on board. When I am looking for reversal trades I always look for the Wolfe wave pattern. It is another strategy that I would urge others to learn. I look forward to your future posts.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks. This makes it all a lot clearer. So, indicator "Ma_Cross_Alert_Once_b" has it all. It has the functions as well for desktop alert, email and push notifications for your mobile.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Good system, simple and efficiency!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Wow very impressive, just out of interest what is your DD% so far using this system if you don't mind me asking? Sounds like the R:R is very good though, the system looks simple and makes a lot of sense to me defo subbed and will be starting to test this out tomorrow I noticed you don't use TP also and watch the trades, but usually what SL do you use / how much risk do you place on each trade? Although I know you have stated you're not generally going to discuss the money management side of things but it would be useful. Thanks for sharing, keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Last week was my 1st week using this system as a stand alone system. After my NZDUSD trade that I posted i finished the week with over 1300% profit and no draw down. I have now withdrawn a large chunk of my profit and will see how I do this coming week. I mentioned SL and TP in post 1. I don't use TP generally and my SL varies so it is hard to give you any firm rules for placement. To be honest this is an area that I believe is an individual matter. I think I also said somewhere that I don't stick to the generally accepted rules of money management - what I mean by that is I trade high volume in relation to account size. Often I will hedge my position if the trade goes against me but because I analyse volume I am confident that I can close both positions for profit. I also have a strategy for getting out of a hedged position with minimum loss and hopefully overall profit even if I can't close both positions for profit. This is something that I am still working on and am not ready to share. I do not want to teach or promote this style of money management at this stage as it carries significant risk and I can not be responsible for others losses. Good luck for this week and welcome to the thread.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Well it's now close to market open and I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunities to make money again this week. Obviously I personally had a very good week last week but I don't want the focus to be on what return I manage to achieve. The only reason I showed my success rate was to show what can be achieved with this system - to be honest I even surprised myself and don't expect to see those returns very often. So let's focus on the charts and getting the system right. My recommendation for those with little forex experience is to pick 1 pair and focus on it for the week. Take every opportunity that you see that ticks all the boxes in terms of long or short setups. Manage your risk - don't let potential small losses turn in to big losses. This is not a tipping service. You now have all the tools you need to trade this system and make money by yourself. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Good thread and well done for posting it. I do not like indicators, but I can see they are a crutch for a lot of people. I would suggest a wild modification to your moving averages, to make your system better. I will not post unless you want me to as I respectfully will not hijack your thread. If you don't want me too just let me know. Well done this thread has the basis of sound advice

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hello, I have a question regarding that pic. To me it looks like a sell, not a buy. Or did I interpret your rules false? D.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I didn't take that trade based on the rules for this system. I took it based on what the volume was telling me and I used to to try to explain that volume analysis can be very powerful. I am sure you interpreted the rules just fine.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Ok. For now I stick to the original rules. 1300% profit talk for themself. What pair are you mainly trading? D.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Just to make something clear for all, I have described the rules for my system as clearly as I can with both historic and live examples. But i also want to try to impart as much useful knowledge as I can which will hopefully help some of you to make a success of trading. As I said in post 1, one of the aims of this thread is to help any struggling traders if I can. To me the best way to do that is not to just provide a template and a few rules for long and short entries. The best way to do that is to make this a thread that is full of useful information and techniques. I am no expert on volume analysis but it definitely helps to have an understanding of it.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
My main pairs are AU, EU, GU, NU, UC, UJ, EG, EJ. All fairly low spreads . I also look at a few minors and the odd exotic. look at my RSI Dash on page 1 and you will see these pairs. I also like Dax but don't necessarily recommend it. I lost a lot of money to Dax in the past. Most of my trades are very short term. I would probably describe my trading as high volume scalping. But I want to try to hold a few positions a bit longer. This is something I am working on. When I say High volume I mean high volume in relation to my account balance. I don't have that much money to trade real high volume.

I have never had an interest in the study of "Volume" in Forex Trading but I have started looking at it. Obviously, then, I am a novice but I must say I am beginning to think (from what I have seen so far) it will be a valuable confidence-booster when trading setups with this system Wizlon32. Again, I know that this is not the subject of this thread but I am only adding volume to your suggestion that this be considered. I held my Short GBPUSD_H1 Trade over the weekend with Stop at Break-even. I added to my position earlier today as I saw what I thought was a Trade Setup based on this system, right after an increase in Volume (Yellow Box) which sought to move the price up for a better price for "Short Money". The pull-back (volume spike) took price right up to resistance, according to my indicator. I then took the trade (H1) on break of 50 Level by the RSI_3. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I flicked over to the M5 Chart (see below) to see what was happening and my eyes "popped". First thought was that I had added to my Short position (H1) much too early but having reviewed the trade, I concluded that the boxes were in fact ticked. However, and more importantly, the M5 Time-frame was a textbook example of what I read this past weekend about Volume and I am going to stick my hand up here, right here, to say that I am a convert. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note: As this is not a thread about volume I will not elaborate on what I read or saw on this M5 timeframe, but if you are into volumes you will know what i am talking about. If you are not, all good. If you are and the picture is not clear to you, please feel free to send me a PM. I will be happy to explain my humble perspective.

Good question Jakdan. For me, I don't actually trade any TF in isolation. I am constantly looking at various TFs in a bid to get the whole picture. so when I see an H1 set up, I take my entry on M5 for example. However I think either method would be acceptable. But if I had to choose 1 method I would probably choose to execute thetrade before the candle closed to get a better entry. Although I know many would disagree with me on that.

Hi, I know the point of your thread is totally diferent than simple "VSA/Volume analysis", but can u point once again the material regarding Volume (I'm very interested!), that u refer in an early post... BTW for the NON-Belivers... "Volume" is second after "Price"... first leading indicator is "PRICE" and price only and than comes "Volume", as relevant activity at level; this is how this "concept" should be interpreted in FX World. I don't want to promote anything but u could also start "looking" the Volume Profiling, which enforce more the principle of "levels/activity at level", levels where u would find yourself in a "better" position toward the market, a position of strength: https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/6099#

Sorry Farmazetron, I can't make a video. All you need to do is this.... 1. Pick a currency pair. 2. Choose your Time Frame and apply the appropriate template. 3. Alalyze what the HTF MA's are telling you (long or short?). 4. Identify a pullback and get ready to enter in line with the Higher TF trend. 5. Use the 3 RSI crossing 50 level as your entry signal. Notes: 1. If you want to use a lower TF for perfecting your entry, once you see that your chosen TF looks ready, simply drop to your chosen lower TF and try to get a clean entry using the exact same method. i.e wait for the lower TF pullback and a use the 3 RSI as your trigger to get in. 2. If using a lower TF to get your entry, consider looking for say an M5 entry when H1 RSI 3 is OB or OS, instead of waiting for it to cross the 50 level.

Here is an example ofa trade thatcouldhave been taken today. (I did not take this trade) USDCAD H1 (left) using M5 for entry. 1. H1 HTF MA cross so we would be looking for shorts. 2. H1 pullback and Upper wicks show the pullback is stalling. 3. H1 3 RSI starts to drop and crosses below 50 from above. 4. At the same time the M5 TF is doing the same. 5. If you missed the entry on wick number 3 then there is another chance on wick 4. 6. Remember this is an H1 trade so don't be too concerned about the M5 10 EMA and its brother (its 10 EMA). If the trade was taken on or around the H1 wick 3, there would have been a possible 80 or so pips up for grabs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

wish I had, but I don't, trying to implement it, but get dizzy with the different pairs and indicators and pvsra and all the stuff. Seems to be a nice system though. I will try to start with it from today trading only eurusd with 2 charts h1 and m5 until the end of the week (4+ days) and see what happens. I would also like to see tp and sl hints from you wizlon. Thank you. V

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I have mentioned my stance on SL and TP more than once already. I don't use TP and I am more likely to hedge my position than use a SL. If you want advice on SL placement I would say put it above or below the previous Lower High for shorts or Higher Low for longs. For me, because I trade high volume relative to account size that could be catastrophic so I don't do it. I can help you with entries but trade / money management is your responsibility. I am a scalper. I hardly ever let a trade reach its maximum potential so you could easily make more money than me. For example GBPUSD on Friday - I only took about a quarter of what was available in the end. Look at the example above. There is nothing about PVSRA. You don't need to worry about volume or volume candles. All you need is a candlestick chart with the Moving averages on it and ther 3 RSI. Stick with it my friend and you will get there.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
A likely entry could be USDJPY? Of H1 we are long and M5 is pullback. 3 As soon as RSI back above 50 could try to buy?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Well done on bagging a few pips! It is not an ideal setup, mainly because there is no pullback with 3 RSI going above 50. The HTF MAs don't look great on M5 but you can see on H1 that they do look to be about to cross. If you can make money even when the setup is not ideal then you are on to a winner in my book. For your next trade see if you can grab a text book entry, or close to one. Lastly please get rid of that RSI Histogram? You don't need it. A normal RSI line is much easier to read.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Possible but looks like we have hit strong resistance. Also if you look at the current leg up you can see higher volume at the tops than the bottoms. This indicates selling at the highs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Oh I see. But at that point the HTF MAs were still saying that H1 was long. Now if you had taken it as a H1 trade using the H4 HTF MAs that would have been a good entry.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I get it. I had to wait for the intersection of two 120EMA. Right?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Yes fpr shorts the green dotted MA shouldbe below the Orange dotted MA. Just be aware though that the 120EMAs on M5 are only an approximation of the H1 10EMAs. A good enough approximation forwhat we do. With that said there is nothing to say you can't profit from less than ideal setups. You certainly can as you have just proved.

As suggested by Wizlon is not a good trade because the two EMA are not crossed.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Personally I would take the profit. There could be some buying here for the reasons I mentioned above. But it's your call.

Thanks, but not for this system geol13.

Bravo. As easy as that!

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thanks wizlon32, can I ask you something. In H1 the 120 ema,s are telling us the trend is down, and in M5 the 120 ema´s is just crossing according to the rules in the same direction that H1. Can we expect the proper pullback to go short again?. I know that is a danger zone, but I just trying to get the rules. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you wizlon, just hope in such a situation that nothing goes wrong and I have a sudden contra trend..any suggestions how to deal with that? setting up barricades?

When using BRNs or Big Round Numbers in your trading here is what you need to be aware of. The favourite place for Big Money to accummulate shorts is above whole (000), Half (500) and Quarter (250/750) numbers. And Below these levels for longs.

Yes. Keep watching and trade what you see.

I manage these situations by hedging. This is something we can look at later in the thread.

Wizlon, my trades for today only 1 pic as its the only one left open (partly) I closed half early when it started to pull back and I also like to keep trades open for a little while however I think you're correct by getting in and out with this system. EUR/SEK closed for + 30 pips NZ/USD closed for - 25 pips due to not following rules 100% the pink and blue were very close but not crossed!!!! live and learn. and below CAD Took 50 off already@ 50% it has pulled back but hoping the trend will flow (not called loony for nothing)

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Excellent. You basically took the trade that I used in my "text Book" example earlier. You could even get another entry here. Those Bullish engulfing candles are slightly concerning though. Really hope it drops for you mate.

Here is an opinion on EURUSD. Could be wrong but makes sense to me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Just use any ofthe other templates and change the HTF MAs to what ever higher TF you want. For weekly use 50EMA and then 50EMA of previous 50 EMA. If you want the HTF MAs I think the 200EMA and 200EMA of previous 200EMA wouldbe close enough.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
You don't need to. The RSIs work independently on each TF. The RSI Dashboard gives you an overview of the RSI window on each TF.

just took a look at h1..oh my..closed all open trades..it's a long one..

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Avoid what? I'dstart by removing your HMA (if thats what is is and whatever arrow indicator you have got (less the MA cross alerts which shouldonly alert once on each cross)

--- 帖子 #187 ---
what is HMA?

When you post a chart, make sure we caan see the whole chart. I can't seee which pair that is or whether your orders are long or short.

Quote what is HMA? Quote Hull Moving Average. Thats what it looks like to me. That green and red MA line that you have got. It will add confusion.

Hi Wizlon, Took this EURJPY long trade today for +20. Pull back on the H1 looked valid with all the MAs in the right place and 3 RSI crossing 50 from below. Entry taken on M5 after high volume up candle just after a couple of high volume down candles pushing price below BRN. In hindsight I should have got in earlier when 3 RSI crossed 50 and not waited for the candle to close. The 3 vertical orange line mark where I could have taken further entries but didn't. Wizlon would you take each one of those entries to add to a position as it progresses in your direction? I didn't because they were all pretty close to my original entry and wasn't sure how high it would go. As of right now price is sitting just below 118.0 Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Is anybody using the Renko version of the system. I think this is where the biggest potential lies. When Iget a trading day off work i am going to really put this to the test. Here is USDCAD showing multiple opportunities for short entires. Red vertical lines are all valid entry points. 1. HTF MAs say sell 2. 3 RSI cross below 50 from above with high volume down bar. 3. 4.

Well done mate. Brilliant. I would probably have closed the 1st position on signs of weakness. If I had kept my eyes on that pair I would have then taken the next entry and I would again have closed on weakness. I would keep repeating as long as everything looked good as it does here. In doing so I (or you) could have made more than just keeping the first trade open and letting it ride. Also by keeping it open there is more chance that it turns on you and you don't make a bean!

Good luck Saranga. I have no doubt that it will add value to your trading.

USDJPY M5 I have a few thoughts about what I just seen on USDJPY. Might be wrong but interested to find out. 1. High volume at relevant Highs = selling 2. Rapid down move allowed shorts to close in profit 3. High volume on way down and at lows = buying 4. Is USDJPY going further up from here? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Wizlon, I wouldn't focus on the yen trades today. They had an earthquake and a tsunami that will have an impact on the yen. The yen will usually rise in disaster times, opposite of what you would think. Then again most of forex is opposite of what you would think.....

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanks Wizlon. Good job I closed my single entry when I did as price made a sharp drop back below my initial entry soon after. I'll take your advice next time about multiple small entries and taking profit as you go. 118.0 level might be fairly solid resistance for EJ, will see tomorrow. Thanks

Hey Wizlon32, How did you integrate the moving average indicator into the RSI window? Also, how did you get to choose the previous option of the moving average indicator? I don't have that option. Thx. D.

Just drag a moving average in to the RSI window as you would to place one on your chart. Yours is set to apply to close as default. Change to apply to previous indicator.

Hi Wizlon, Took this trade on GBPJPY 5 min. Was able to grab some pips.Hope I did it right .....

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Well done ckselvan. The HTF MAs were not ideal for shorts but they are only there to provide you with information. How you chose touse that information is entirly us to you. However good work using the RSIs! Looking at GBPJPY now I can see that you could even have bagged a few more pips from the trade.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi wizlon32 Wonder if you have an indicator that alerts when the RSI cross the 50 lvl? Also if you have any material about RSI pullbacks? the only one I could find online was Larry Connors RSI-2 trading system but it's not really what i'm looking for the pullback using RSI was a great addition to my system and improved my entries helping me avoid some not so good entries, it fits like a glove when using MTF trend analysis

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I use this one, I set it for 51, 49. I use it to alert me to the pull back of the RSI.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Sorry mokuro I don't have any of those that youhave asked for. Glad it's helped you with your system. I see jcat has uploaded an RSI Alert Indicator so I hope that works for you too. Now that Ihave been trading this system for a few days I amgoing to review it including all of the indicators in a bid to improve it. Don't worry if you are just getting the hang of it, the basic principles will stay the same.

Nice one, how can I do to have that candles an volume bars? is very interesting for my trading.

See post 126. Download the pdf and study it to learn how to read volume. Go to a PVSRA thread and get volume candles suite and volume suite indicators.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Thanks wizlon32

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Here is an indicator that I think would be useful for keeing an eye on the HTF trend and would potentially allow the removal of the HTF MAs which may help to remove confusion and screen clutter. Also it would be easier to trade in line with 2 HTF trends. i.e the H1 and H4 or H4 and Daily. So if both of the top lights were green that is definetly when you want to look for longs and obviously shorts if they are both red. I can't share it here as I received it with a paid subscription that I had some time ago with an online educational website. Also the MA values in this one are not fully customisable. You can change the MA period and method but if you choose Exponential for one then you have to use exponential for the other. Has anyone got something similar? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hmm, been reading this thread, and you've shown some nice ideas.. but now you've gone against the whole idea and thread title? "Trade the Current Trend" .. those trades are counter trend into resistance... It's gonna get confusing bud!

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I found the indicator already on Forex Factory so here is the link. Ihaven't tried it so I hope it works. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=539500 I will be working on finding some good settings for this new indicator. Please feel free to experiment too and share your ideas. Here is what my template will look like with the new indicator added and the HTF MAs removed. I am sticking with my 10 EMA combination on my current trading chart. They will possible be the only MAs that I will use. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You may notice that on the screen shot above that Ihave got the settings set to a generally fast MA combination. The reason that I think that might be good for me is because I like scalping - longer term traders would probably prefer a slower combination like the 34 and 55 EMAs. I would use the 10 combination if Icould but the indicator doesn't take those settings.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
They were not traded in to resistance. They were trades taken away from resistance. Big difference. Unless you mean they were trades in to MA support? I do see what you are saying though and I was aware of that. However as the thread progresses I am going to keep showing examples of how to use volume because it is so important. I didexplain that that trade was not as per this system. If people don't want to understand volume then they need not pay it any attention. But I would go as far as to say if you understand volume you dont need any other indicator (apart from price) I said in one of my posts that I want this thread contain lots of additional ideas and information that will help develop traders and Volume is key! I will also add that I want this system to evolve. There is room for improvement in everything and nothing will improve if youdon't make it happen. I am however very keen to keep the dynamic of the system intact as it is.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Yeah I see, that's fine mate , it's your thread after all!! Only saying because I started reading the thread, and within half an hour of reading the method had gone from HTF MAs and 5M MAs &amp; Rsi to volume and counter trend Keep the the info coming tho . Some nice ideas

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I know that some will not feel comfortable without the HTF MAs on the chart there is nothing to stopyou using HTF MAs and the signal Bar indicator. For example I might use the M5 Chart with H1 HTF MAs anduse the signal bar indicator to see whats going on on H4 and D1. Please let me know if you agree with leeshindig. If Iam confusing you I will calm it down a bit. Maybe I get a little carried away.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
My point of view...you are in a good road. I like to use M5 to do my trades, but Im not felling very comfortable with the HTF ema´s in that chart because if in H1 was a downtrend, you must to wait to the HTF ema´s in M5 go in the same way. Waiting that happen you can lost a good trade. I feel more comfortable with you last chart than older ones.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thank you for your comment Trinquette. You mean when the 10 EMA combo has just crossed on H1 and there is a delay on their repraventative MAs (HTF MAs) on M5? I don't see the MA cross as a signal myself, especially the HTF MA Cross. But that does not mean that you are wrong. We all see things differently and have our own experiences to guide us. My thoughts on removing the HTF MAs....... We would not be ignoring the HTF trend because we can use the Signal Bar Indicator. Actually we are now able to monitor 2 HTF trends with less clutter / confusion on the chart. I find this quite interesting. I think it might now be easier to hit the button when we get an RSI signal! Also the bottom row of lights adds another MA filter which you can choose to use or ignore. We will see.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
jcat, can you please share your RSI above/under indicator please? I would like to check it out.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I went to the FF thread you pointed to earlier, but when used, I don't see the "previous week open/close" value. And, how did you get the indicator down into another window (lower right)? I gave the corner all kinds of values and watched it walk around on the main data window. I'm willing to work with this if it means cleaning up my charts w/o losing data points.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Not sure about the previoius week thing. I don't want to use that part anyway so I might download it myself. Change the sig_bars_window to 1 or 2 depending on how many windows you have got. window 0 is the main chart. Window 1 is the highest sub window. window 2 is the next sub window down etc

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Oh, gotch'a! Took care of that. My "general area" values for putting into the lower right-hand corner of my 2nd sub-window are now: Corner of chart = 1 Shift Up_Dn = 30 Adjust side to side = 0 Sig Bars Window = 2 Where's the EASY BUTTON ?? !! Thanks

Everything you need to know about this system is contained in the posts and pages prior to this post. I am on a mission to improve from here on in. I will be trialling things and posting advanced ideas. The aim is ultimately to come out the other end with a simple and profitable system. If you are likely to get confused then just keep reading the 1st 11 pages and keep practising. If you have any questions regarding anything that has been posted so far then please just ask and I will do my best to answer. I will continue to post some of my trades and other potential set ups that Idid not get. I did say in post 1 that I was not here to teach the basics of trading. If you are following along and understanding then I welcome you to help me. Lets try things out. Experiment. Lets make this a system that really works and makes money for all of us.

The two I have are on your template, in this picture. You see your RSI 3 (with over bought/sold). The middle indicator is the color bars, that simple shows above or below a certain level. I was using it for the RSI 14, but your dashboard takes its place. Then the bottom indicator is an RSI histogram, set at RSI 3. It is easier for me to use and see when the cross occurs. The "RSI Custom" is the bars. The "RSI Color" is the Histogram.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thank you jcat.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Here is a quick snap-shot of what I'm looking at. AUDUSD H1 Indicators 1. jcats RSI bar indicator set to 8 RSI and both value 1 and 2 at 50. 2. Signal Bar indicator - set to 34 and 55 EMA. 200EMA for bottom lights filter. 3. The normal 3 RSI indicator with no 14 RSI. 4. 34 EMA and 55 EMA - because that is what my signal bar indicator is using so it gives you an idea of how they look and interact. This also adds another filter but is optional. This chart is ideal because all the lights in the signal bar are red and price + EMAs on current TF are bearish. When trading everyone must use thier discretion. I will check out some not so ideal charts tomorrow. So we have established that we are looking for short entires, ideally after a bullish pullback. Short Entry Signals (vice versa for longs) jcats RSI bar indi turns green when we get a pull back - this is time to take notice. 3 RSI will give you the 1st indication as it turns down (preferably from OB levels but but essential). The ideal entry is 3 RSI crossing back below 50 level from above and RSI Bar turning red. The red vertical lines show posssible entries according to what I wrote above. Additional Entry Signals When there is no change of colour on the RSI Bar indi to denote a pullback, but the 3 RSI does pullback and then crosses the 50 level again. I have not marked these so as to avoid too much clutter on the screen, but there are many of them that would be profitable. As traders we must apply our own discretion. Look for S/R levels, Whole numbers, use fibonacci retracements and so on. Don't be an easy target for the big players. Finally, I really can't recommend Volume as an indicator enough. Please study it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #246 ---
RSi candles, they do they same thing, and might be easier than the bars even.

Have a look at it Jcat and see what you think. I like my volume candles so perhaps not for me. Thanks for your help buddy. Off to bed now. Catch you tomorrow.

MTF MA

--- 帖子 #249 ---
If anyone is testing out the signalbar indicator, my recommendation is set it to show the 2 TFs immediately higher than the TF you are on. So if trading H1 set to H4 and D1. If trading on M5 try M15 and M30. Please share your findings and any recommendations.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Good morning. I can not set the signal bar M15 and M30 as I do?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
You should be able to but the writing won't appear. I think H4 is the minimum TF that will display the TF letters. Test it out by setting to H1 and H4. The H1 should be coloured correctly but no TF letters. Test any TF combo you want by applying the settings, adding the MAs to your chart and switch between the relevant TFs to make sure it is correct. Just remember which light is which as with M15 and M30 there will be no TF letter marking.

I think this is a change for the better.

Ok. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
The PVSRA bars is an interesting indicator.. thanks for bringing that one to my attention. Not sure if you know this, so please disregard if you do. But volume in MT4 is not the actual volume of contracts bought or sold at the broker. It's merely the amount of ticks the price made during a bar at your broker. Tick volume. (change your market watch window to tick chart) Volume in MT4 decides if it was a buy or sell if it was an up tick, or down tick. Actual buying and selling volume (in contracts) could be far different, there could be many sizeable trades, made in single transactions that make more buying vol than sell in a bar, but tick volume may say otherwise. In general though, the volume on MT4 is a good guide to momentum points. Where most trades are happening, or where the market participants are happy to make trades. Not so much the direction they are trading. So even seeing a green bar at a low, could be an indicator of an acceleration in price, if traders are still bearish by selling in large quantities.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yeah I'm aware of all that mate but thanks for taking the time to post your explanation. All a retail trader can do is do their best to interpret what they are seeing. Thats all i do and it is working for me so far. If you had enough money to manipulate the market would you push price to a relative high in order to really unleash your buying power? Did you read the PVSRA pdf?

Took this short trade just a couple of minutes ago. Now it might not look like much but at 2 Lots I made more than enough profit to satisfy me. A few of these in a day and bingo! GBPUSD M15. Green MA is 34 EMA. Orange MA is 55 EMA. Signal Bar set to M30 and H1 (next 2 higher TF) and Also 34 EMA and 55 EMA. 200 EMA is the other MA filter. 1. 3 RSI Goes OB on Bullish Pullback then drops. 2. RSI 3 crosses 50 level from above. 3.

Well done for exploring volume. Don't get over-confident too fast though. Take it slow and alalyse charts until you get the hang of it.Read the pdf again and again and it will pay off.

Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas. He said that when you have an edge (which we do), you should take every trade you see where your edge is present. You will have some losers but because you have an edge, you will come out on top. This is how a casino makes profit. They only have a slight edge over the punters but because of the number of games of poker, roulette, slot machines, blackjack etc etc, that take place, their edge plays out and they make a lot of money. Just something to think about.

Anyone like trading Gold? Here is a couple of possible nice H4 entries. Signal Bar set to D1 and W1. W1 Signal Bar light is green but RSI Dash looks very bearish. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Can you re upload your new templates to the 1 post please, all the additions are quite difficult to follow when your basic 1 post is miles apart from what we now use Thanks for your hard work though, currently running 2 trades in profit.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi Wizlon, I was checking out your revised strategy and have a question/observation. On the Signal Bar indicator it seems that the "price on 200 EMA" colours/TFs are hard coded H4/D1 and above. I have my M15 charts set so the 2 time frames on the indy are M30 and H1 as you suggest. On those time frames price is definitely above the 200 EMA. Is that correct? Presumably we should be paying more attention to the 34/55 EMA cross colours than the 200 EMA? See charts below. Thanks M15 Attached Image (click to enlarge) H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) D1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Theyre not really miles apart. It would take you about 1 minute to replicate my current chart template. I am not going to upload any more templates for the time being. The reason is that as you have pointed out, things are evolving and they may well evolve further. Here's what I would do if I were you. Use one of the RSI Dash On Chart templates that are already on the thread. Delete all the MAs and then add the 34 and 55 EMA. Then add the Signal Bar Indicator and apply the settings that I have already described depending on what TF you want to trade. If you want the Volume Suite and the Volume Candles Suite then add them. If you want the ADR indi then download it and apply it to the chart. Finally save the template. Done.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Seems you might be right there. Must have looked right by coincidence when I checked. Dammit. Have you managed to confirm 100% that the top row works correctly for lower TFs? Hope I haven't been duped by them too If the top row is correct we may as well turn everything to black except the 2 lights that we need. I would like a decent fully working version though - I've seen FerruFx around here quite often, I wonder if he would help? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #280 ---
They seem to be OK but I'll try setting the MA cross alert with the settings below for the 34/55 EMAs. When I get a cross signal just need to check that the lights in the signal bar match, i.e they have changed colour. Anybody else spot any funny behaviour with Signal bar lights please let us know? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Just checked a few pairs and I'm confident that the top lights do work on the lower TFs. Thanks for pointing that out Nelson. It's strange that the top row works but not the bottom.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Not so simple to recreate in 1 min, 30 minutes later I have most things, how do I get the over under bar indicator that one is alluding me.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
You're welcome Wizlon. Shame we haven't got the mt4 file as am sure someone on here could make the required changes. Will keep an eye out for 34/55 EMA crosses on the M30 and H1 and make sure the lights change as per the cross.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Its not that I don't want to help you - I do but I have uploaded so many templates already that more will cause even more confusion. The over /under bar iis called RSI Custom. It was posted by jcat I think.

Hey Wiz, Thanks for your system I'm a high volume scalper too, I've mixed up your method with mine and I love it I trade the M1 in bias with M5, I use EMA 20 on M1 and here goes some of today's trades, done for the day. Plz ignore my other indicators. Good luck all.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Good Stuff DreamwalkeR. Obviously your template works for you but I'm curious about the fact that you have the MAs and the Kumo overlapping. Don't they basically give you the same information or do you get something unique from each?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Now here is a little idea that might seem a bit wacky to some of you but I find it interesting so I am going to share it anyway. If it is not for you then simply ignore it. These 2 charts are both EURGBP. The one on the right is M5. The one on the left is a 15 second chart. The numbers 1 and 2 show you the same points on each TF. There may be better examples, this was just the 1st pair that I chose to use. You can see that S15 moves and acts in exactly exactly the same way as M5. And every other TF for that matter. So here is the idea...... When you think that you have the ideal setup on M5 or M1, you could take the trade according to the S15 TF using the exact same rules as you would on any other TF. You might find S10 or S20 more to your liking or even S30. You can produce any non-standard TF that you want. I am trying to check out whether this provides any advantage regarding volume and determining if the majority is coming in at the highs or the lows within individual candles. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Details of how to get non standard TF's can be found at the link below if you are interested. If you are then watch the video that is provided there. I think it couldbe a scalper's dream. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...&amp;highlight=ovo

--- 帖子 #293 ---
A short answer; yes they do, but I keep it for two reasons: 1) Dynamic support/resistance. 2) Visual comfort A long answer; you see both of our methods share the same concept with a different indicators. I as well trade pullbacks using Kumo, two stochs (one of them is a MTF), and the 21 RSI. Kumo acts as your EMAs, the two Stochs as your two RSIs, and the 21 RSI for pullbacks at level 50 in confluence with the LTF Stoch. This is why I liked your system as it's so similar to mine, adding it all on chart makes me more confident as I trade big lots aiming for 10 pips or more. Having said that, I'm sure I'll remove the duplication over time.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Keeping an eye on the higher time frame trend direction is a good thing. The aim of doing so is to try to ensure that you are trading in the same direction as big money players, or smart money. The way we do that with this system is either by adding some HTF MAs to your chart or by using the little lights indicator which allows us to see the position of our chosen MAs on 2 higher timeframes (or more but more may cause confusion). Currently I am using the 34 and 55 EMAs. Now within all trends you are going to get pullbacks and that is the time that you ideally want to get in. Our template also allows us to see at a glance what is going on in terms of pullbacks to a degree i.e the RSI Dash. Another way to identify pullbacks is to use a combination of faster MAs, as I did with the 10 EMA combination or the 10EMA and 30 LWMAs. A fast MA combination doesn't only let you see pullbacks, it lets you see whether price is actually moving with the direction of the slower MAs (the direction you want to trade) which is again really important. I would like to be able to see a faster MA combination along side my HTF 34 and 55 EMA Lights so I am simply going to add the same indicator with faster MA settings applied. As we have already looked at this combination I am going to use the 10 EMA and 30 LWMA. I am not going to have those moving averages on my chart though as I think they can make it difficult to enter at times. I am only interested in them on the higher time frames. So yes my template is evolving again very slightly but in doing so I am kind of coming back in line with how the template began, with fast and slow moving averages combinations being used in conjunction with each other to get a better look at the bigger picture, but still with less clutter and confusion. GBPUSD M15. I would have been looking to trade long. The vertical lines show 2 posible entries. If both had been taken about 100 pips could have been made. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #295 ---
My take is looking at more indi's only made me more weary trading 8 hours a day. Besides no indi is actually current or futuristic reading. Price is the Holy Grail. Indi's are fine for micro managers. They can see past repetitious movements and use em for present situations. I tried the RSI candles and several other indi's and aside from a few moving averages nothing really improves my pip take per month. Maybe swing trading. I jumped on your bandwagon because it mimics what I have been doing for a year like your 1st page templates. You could lock up this system now because you'd have a consistent flow of new traders appreciating the work you've done here. Because it flat out works. But much more gobblygook and it will slide down the Forex Forum's Systems section. After trading 7 years now I've seen many a good system go the way of the railroad. Happy Thanksgiving.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
If price alone is the holy grail then why are we not all rich? If you are bored with my gobblygook then don't read it. Personally I have only been trading about 20 months and this gobblgook has helped to dramatically improve my pip take.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Thank you for sharing this system with us, I would like to ask if you look to H1 chart when you tread 5M or you use only M5. I mean that the templates that you shared we use them if we look to long time treads then we look to H1 and when we want to scalping then you use 5M only?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Wizlon, Don't know if you've seen these mini charts but I find them quite useful in terms of checking where price is in relation to MAs on higher time frames. I have just one of these windows open in my profile along with the other charts and just drag any pair on to the chart to do a quick check. In the main window the MAs are 34 EMA (green) 55 EMA (blue) and 200 EMA (red dotted). In the mini charts the MAs are 10 EMA (white) and 30 LWMA (magenta). I have attached the indy in case anyone finds in useful. The mini charts are capable of displaying all kinds of other indies too (if required) although only the MAs are used in my screen shot.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
The template is designed so that you do not have to look at the higher time frames. That is the whole point of using the HTF MAs and MA lights. I do like to keep one eye on a couple of higher time frames though in case specific candle patterns appear that may cause me concern.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
That is quite anice little indicator. Especially as you can apply indicators to the mini charts. I think the danger though is you might for example be trying to trade the M5 and you will be getting conflicting information from other TFs on the mini charts which could scare you from getting in to a trade. I think there is probably too much information to alalyse. Thats just my opinion though. Thanks for sharing Nelson.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
For the record, the whole purpose of the template and system that I am trying to produce is to give us the ability to trade using just 1 chart but in doing so still having an awareness of whats going on in higher time frames. It is hugely important to me that we can make decisions at a glance without too much information to process. I hope that makes sense and that you understand where I am going with this. I want just the right amount if information in front of me for an easy, stress free life.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Off to bed soon as I have got an early start but just wanted to thought this info might be useful to some of you. Here is UJ M1. The green lights at top right tell us that the trend is up on M5 and M15. The red lights below them tell us that there is a pullback on those TF. Ideally we would want to trade long in line with the slower MAs (Top). First for an entry to be valid want to see our M1 34 EMA cross above the 55 EMA. Aggresive traders might take the next RSI entry signal. A more conservative entry would be to wait until the bottom lights also turn green and then take the next RSI signal. Or you might feel confident when the M5 has changed but the M15 is still behind. This is down to each individual to decide. You can also watch the relevant TF on the RSI Dash to see what it is saying. It may pre-warn you that a potential entry is coming and it may also produce an entry signal of it's own. If what ive said above does not happen then you don't have a signal so you save your money and find another pair to trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I think I am quite happy with this template for now so I am going to try not to make any changes for a while. I want to use it and really get to grips with the signals including which lights we should be expecting to fall in to line 1st when we are stalking an entry etc - I presume there would be a specific order and I could take a guess but best to see it several times with my own eyes. Maybe the order will be random? We will see.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi WIZLON, Could you please ZIP your indies and template of this latest version and share? Tks and Rgds,

Pretty Hectic Week at Work; not much Trading. Amazing to see how the thread has developed during the course of the week; good on you all. Nice work Wizlon and very good idea to leave the Templates as they are for the time being. Hope you have all been Trading Well!. Cheers

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi krismitt. yeah I think I've definitely got the template how I want it for now but the MA light settings need some work. I was stalking UJ for a long before I went to bed and the lights weren't as "responsive" as i'd have liked. I was encouraged to see them react and change as I expected though but I just felt that they were a bit slow. I've got a couple of ideas so I will see how it goes. Also encouraging is the fact that I chose UJ M1 based on the colour of the lights at the time (as per my example last night) and UJ definitely went up shortly after. I also had my S15 chart open at the side and I managed to see a bear to bull transition on that TF which also pre-warned me of the pending bullish activity. Another pre-warning was the volume increase at the M1 low right before the sudden up thrust. All good stuff in my book.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
What are you all looking at? I'm stalking GBPUSD, looking for a Long entry on H1. Trade Well!.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hello mate. Yes I will upload a final template this afternoon (my time). Indicator settings will need to be adjusted by individual users though to fit the pair and TF they want as unfortunately there isn't a "one size fits all" solution.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Sweet. For now and until you are happy with the lights, I have decided to use my eyes and trade the system based on what I am able to see. Of course price action can move "on a dime" as you have said elsewhere but I'm happy to Trade the H1 for now, with the occasional "peep" at the M5 s.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thank you, I understand what you mean to change the setting for each TF but so you have any guidance for adjusting the setting per the pair?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Nothing wrong with that buddy. Thats all i do most of the time when I trade on my phone. or when im scalping but I do like the idea of the lights as a little confidence booster. Hopefully I can nail something that really works. even if I cant I am enjoying trying.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Not in the sense that you are asking - That is a one size fits all solution. I just meant that you need to set some of the indicators to the current pair you are watching. Unfortunately they don't all have a "current pair only" setting like Lawgirls Trend Display does.

--- 帖子 #313 ---

Hi WIZLON, Ok with many thanks. Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Here is the current template as requested. This is my suggested M5 TF Template currently set for EURUSD. Use the same principles but ammend the indicator settings to fit the TF you are trading. I have moved the RSI Dash to the bottom right side of the chart.The MA Dash is still top right. MA Lights Description I made the following changes to the MA Lights in an attempt to make them more responsive (and my 1st impression is good). 1. Instead of having the next 2 higher time frames, I have set it to the next higher one and the next lower one. The LTF Lights can provide us with an early warning that after a pullback price is starting to turn back in in line with the HTF trend. We can see what is happening in front of us on our trading TF. Wait for 34x55 EMA cross (if it's not already in line with the HTF) and take the next signal. Drawing a Down trend line when looking to enter long and waiting for a break above it could add confidence. Drawing an up trend line when looking to enter short and waiting for a break below it could add confidence. This method is not essential to this system by any means but it might help. 2. I have changed the 10 EMA x 30 LWMA to 5 EMA x 8 SMA for better responsivness. Template Attached File(s) M5 New.tpl 64 KB | 301 downloads Hope that makes sense. Here is EURUSD M5. MA lights are M15 and M1. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi guys, do you have some public results trading this system, is it worth it? BR Tomas

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Just like the RSI Dashboard, a full MA Lights Dashboard could provide clues to potential trades. Here is an example of USDCHF. You can see that the Higher time frame trend is long and it is currently on a pullback or it is starting to change to a down trend. Straight away at a glance I know what is going on on multiple time frames with this pair Attached Image

I notice you are using an H1 template. I think it might be better to use H4 and M15 MA Lights. I find M30 very similar to H1 and I have decided not to use M30. H1 = 2 x M30 but H1 = 4 x M15 and H4 = 4 x H1. The maths just seems more sensible and even rather than a bit one sided.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hi wizlon thanks for sharing your system, I think pivot points are good for entry and exit with your system, you should try.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hello rare. Yes pivot points and a possible addition that many would find useful. Until recently I was using pivot points in my trading and I may start again at some point but for now I don't want to be distracted by them. Thank you for your post and the indi. I have a question for you. I see you are still using the fast MAs on your trading template. I find that a lot of good entries happen when they are still pointing towards counter trend, so that is why I personally took them out. Do you just enter on a signal anyway or do you wait and take a signal once they also align with the HTF?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Right! It makes sense Wizlon32 . Thanks!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I take counter trend sometimes like R2 held the price so price goes back to ema 200. The best thing to do is enter and lock in profit fast and let it run. I don't look at HTF, I only trade the trend of the moment.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
This week has been an important week regarding the development and improvement of this system and it's assosiated indicators and Dashboards. The system is still the same system that I described in post 1. But after 2 weeks of assessing and developing the assosiated tools for the job (indicators) I think they are now properly fit for purpose. Next week I will put it to the test. I will trade some scalps to make sure I make my money and I will also try to trade some H1 and possibly H4 trades which I aim to hold for longer. Over the weekend I will examine some charts and I will pick 1 main pair to trade for the week. I will try to post my ideas in advance and I will post my results afterwards so others can evaluate, learn and critique. For anyone who is interested in this system all you need to do is conduct a bit of back testing and you will easily find that it has massive potential. Even without the dashboards this can be a very profitable system if you follow the rules (I will update post 1 on Sunday). The dashboards are just an added extra that you can take or leave but I do recommend at least using 1 of them for HTF insight. Have a nice weekend everyone. Thanks to those who have contributed. Hope to see some of you back next week. Wiz

--- 帖子 #335 ---
New templates and all required indicators added to post 1. A quick recap on the basic rules. 1. Trade in line with the HTF 34 x 55 EMA (MA Lights Dashboard) 2. Current TF 34 x 55 EMA must agree with HTF. 3. Wait for 8 RSI pullback (RSI Custom Indicator) and enter when 8 and 3 RSI cross 50 level in desired direction. 4. Additional entries - no visible 8 RSI pullback (RSI Custom Indi) but 3 RSI crosses 50 level in desired direction. 5. LTF MA Lights can provide early warning that price is turning but should not be taken as a signal to enter in isolation. 6. Trade your prefered TF signals. The MA and RSI Dashboards are for HTF and LTF information only. 7. Add more TF's to the MA and RSI Dashboards if you wish,but more may result in confusion and conflicting signals. 8. Understand the tools you have at your disposal and their limitations. They will not trade for you. You are the brain. 8. Trading is a discretionary business. Only you are responsible for your profits and losses. Good luck

Well done htawfik. Thats makes things much easier and will make swithching between charts and TF's much quicker and less trouble. I have checked the MA Dash indicator and it also seems to work. Now all we need to do is save a template for each TF and apply it each time we switch. We no longer need to keep going in tothe indicator settings. Good job!

Hi all first post. Just finished reading the thread over the weekend i am really liking what I see. Just to help out on the template. I had the same issue. You can go into the tpl file and search and find some of the indicators as wizlon's aren't all located under the root indicator directory ie. he has some subfolders in the indicator directory. wizlon, you mentioned earlier about not doing SL and TP. I am looking forward and hoping that you will share your strategy at some point. One question I do have is what criteria are you looking at for exiting your positions. is it PA or trailing stop or a pip limit? Thank you for sharing your system. I hope this helps and I look forward to learning this system.

Hi Grantmac. All of the indicators less the Moving averge, RSI, volume suite and volume candles suite are in the zip folder in post 1 and I'm sure I don't have them in sub folders in my MT4. The MA and RSI indicators are where they are by default so there should be no problems there and I have not posted the volume and volume candles on purpose (though I do have them in a sub folder).

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I exit my position when I have made enough pips to make the trade worth while for me. Sometimes the trade lasts less than 10 seconds. Other times I let it run a bit longer depending on my level of confidence. I said somewhere that once lots of people show that they have grasped the system and are making money using it I will think about sharing my hedge strategy. For now that is not the focus. Making green pips routinely is. As yet very few traders have even posted a trade, considering there has been hundereds of template downloads.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I used my discretion htawfik. I recommend that you do the same and use yours.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thanks also I noticed that using the old way of RSI 14 it give more acurate results. I will test it again and give my results

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I think you are missing the point of the 8 RSI custom indicator. It is an additional filter that can be used to highlight a deeper pullback than just using the 3 RSI. When the 14 RSI crosses 50 then we are potentially looking to trade in the opposite direction. Anyway, please find the best way that works for you.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi Wizlon, I jumped into that trade but a bit later off the 5Mchart once I had a cross of the MA's. Did you take multiple positions on the 5M on the way down? I notice there were a few opportunities to enter.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Well done Grantmac, that is good to hear. Personally I didn't as I am working and can't monitor properly. Please show your entries to help others to learn.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Sure I hope this helps. I'm not sure on target yet though. If I was to be greedy I would say off the H4 low around 1.0533 level but I am thinking if it gets back down to the low of the 5M chart (1.0560) I might exit.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I got it now thanks a lot for your help

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I wouldn't consider that greedy or unrealistic for a trade which makes sense on H4. Thats a nice H4 engulfing candle. Let's see.

Good trading krismitt.

I am sure that my use of the LTF MA lights and RSI Lights has probably surprised some people, but I think the LTF trend can be also just as important as the HTF trend. One of the biggest mistakes traders can make is jumping in too soon so why not also keep an eye on the LTF trend. When the LTF trend matches the HTF and we get a signal on the current time frame (CTF) then we have a nice situation - HTF, LTF and CTF all in agreeance. Surely this gives us the best chance of success? I am going to change my LTF lights to M5 or M1 for all TF templates. The chart below is EU M5 with H4 template.. You can see that the M5 34 x 55 EMA cross can capture good moves. My EU entry was well after the cross. Previously my H4 template LTF lights were set to H1 which I feel is too slow.

Well done mate and thanks for sharing. Is the screenshot from a trading platrform and were all trades entered and managed manually?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I am using MT4 but I am also using BDM, you can find it at FF, it is free but really good tools to try. no auto used for the entry or exit, all manual

--- 帖子 #381 ---
questo è il mio modello

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Heiken Ashi could also be a good variation!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I want to repeat a point that I made early on in the thread and that is that the moving averages on the chart give very similar information to 14 period RSI (or a moving average of it). When the 14 RSI is above 50, there there is a good chance that the MAs are also bullish. And when the 14 RSI is below 50 there is a good chance that the MAs are also bearish. My personal preference is to use the 34 x 55 EMA combination before the 14 RSI to determine the trend. Perhaps your preference is to use the 14 RSI; my point is that you do not need to get too focused on both - but the choice is completely yours. When I made this point at the beginning of the thread I said that I was going to include the 14 RSI in my RSI window for the time being to help to get my point accross and to aid learning. I am now going to remove it again as I don't need it. The chart below is GU H1. The white vertical lines divide the periods when the 14 RSI is generally above or below 50. You will notice that the 34 x55 EMA almost tells the same story as I have just mentioned above. (black line is a smoothed MA of 14 RSI). I hope that makes sense and makes this point clear. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Wizlon, I just want to confirm something on the MA/RSI lights settings so it is clear for me so I can set up my templates and trade accordingly. If the current time frame is H4 - TFs on the lights would be D1 (HTF) and M1/M5 (LTF) If the current time frame is H1 - TFs on the lights would be H4 (HTF) and M1/M5 (LTF) If the current time frame is M15 - TFs on the lights would be H1 HTF) and M1/M5 (LTF) And in all cases the MAs (34 above/below 55) on the current time frame should be in the same direction as the HTF. Is that all correct? Do you use the LTF charts for entries or wait for the signals on one of the current time frames mentioned above? If H4 is you current TF but say you enter on a valid M5 signal you may be entering long before a valid signal shows up on an H4 chart. Presumably this is the idea as long as the H4 and D1 MAs are going in the same direction that you are entering on. Thanks

--- 帖子 #385 ---
You are right, my LTF RSI an MA Lights will be either M1 or M5. I believe anything higher is too slow because the purpose of the LTF lights is to indicate the immediate price direction. Please bear in mind that I am experimenting and trying to refine things to get the best template with clear and workable information displayed that I can act upon. You are also right that the 34 x 55 EMAs on the current TF should tell the same story as the same MA combination on the HTF. Remember we are tring to trade in line with the HTF. The safest way to trade is to wait for a valid signal on your current trading TF. That is what I recommend to everyone. But lets say for example that you are stalking a long trade. The HTF 34 x 55 EMAs should be saying long (or else you wouldn't be looking for a long entry) The current TF 34 x 55 EMAs should also be saying long. (or else you wouldn't be looking for a long entry) Price retraces to some strong area of S/R - maybe a whole number of a fibonacci level and the LTF 34 x 55 EMA crosses in your desired direction. In my eyes it is now acceptable to take an entry signal on the LTF. Another example of applying discretion; today I was looking for a short entry on EU H4 but before I got a valid H4 signal as per this system a lovely bearish H4 pin bar appeared. The next H4 candle retraced up approx 50% of the previous candle wick. At that point I placed multiple shorts and closed them all for a few pips profit. My short trades were in line with the current and the HTF trend. but were against the LTF trend at that moment in time. I applied my discretion based on my knowledge and experience. I hope that answers your question.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
If all else fails, pick a time frame, delete the MA Lights and the RSI Lights and just trade the 34 x55 EMA direction using the 3 RSI for entries. Maybe just use 1 MA Lights indicator to show you the HTF trend. You need to work out what works for you and do it!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Totally agree Wislon32. I agree that the information they provide is comparable; I also agree that each Trader ought to be comfortable with their final Template. Thought I would share, as well, that I use use the Smoothed MA of the 14 RSI for exits. I may exit my Trade as soon as the 50 level is broken by this indicator on a specified Time-frame (not necessarily on the chart of my entry). If I am trading the LONG on the M5 for example, I might (not always) exit when "RSI_14" breaks below the 50 level. It's slightly faster than the MA Cross (34 / 55) and is great for Swing Trades on say the H4. Again, not a rule, but something I like to have as a viable option. Trade well!.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Thanks to you Bro. Lots of nuggets in this thread. If we Trade this system well, we can all make a deposit at the end of each week Cheers.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Well done Rare! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Nice idea mate. Check this out.....Ignore the 55 EMA for a minute and see how price interacts with the 34EMA on any TF. Notice at the same time how the 14 RSI is interacting with the 50 level. The smoothed MA can make a difference and could be worth experimenting with further.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Will certainly have a go at it!. I know that the 34 EMA is Boss! Trade well!.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi Wizlon, Thanks for your explanation, it all helps to make things clearer. Taking EU from yesterday as an example - if on a H4 TF I had waited for a 3 RSI crossing 50 and for the candle to close before entering, we would be talking about entering when the big down candle had completed. If that was the case I would still be waiting now for the trade to be in positive territory. On the other hand if I'd waited for the 3 RSI to cross 50 on the H4 and as soon as it did so (i.e. not waited for the H4 candle to close) then used the first available pullbacks on the M5 to enter I would have entered much nearer the beginning of the big down candle and still be in profit. This all sounds like it would be a good way to enter the longer term H4 moves. A few of those a week is all that I need Thanks

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Yes, but that is quite an extreme example due to the size of that H4 candle. Don't forget you also have the 90, 70, 30 and 10 levels which can also be used in the same way as the 50 level.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
OK Thanks Wizlon, I'll bear those levels in mind too.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Well here is my first multiple entry trade using this system. Got in late on some entries and it lasted longer than I wanted and it will probably go down further but all in all a profitable trade on EU.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
next trades based on the rejection of the H1 chart on US.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
USDSGD - Is M5 your trading TF? I presume it is because your MA and RSI lights are set to M15 and M1. The problem there is that you are trading against your current TF (M5) 34 x 55 EMAs. Price has not yet turned. Let the 34 x 55 fall in to line 1st and then trade the pullbacks. Also your MA and RSI Lights are set to EURUSD. If they were set properly to USDSGD they would be telling you to trade long. Youneed to in to the settings and change the currency pair to 0.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Yeah, thanks wizlon, I hadn't changed the template yet. I was actually looking for a reversal off the resistance area on the one hour and probably jumped the gun a bit. Should have waited for conformation of the 34/55EMA's.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
thanks alot. hopefully learn some thing from all of you. gob bless all of you

Thanks for the Template, I love changing currency with ease!!

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Welcome thaihoc. Please study the thread so far to gain an understanding of what we are doing here and how to use the indicators properly.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Glad it worked out for you. But that is a good lesson for us all to learn - don't jump the gun! I said before and I will say again one of biggest mistakes you can make is jumping the gun. They say that most traders lose, even when they are right about what direction price is going to go because they get in to early. You don't need to catch the beginning of a move to make money and you definately don't need to worry about taking every last pip right to the end of the move. Just be happy with taking a bit out of the middle. By doing this you have more chance of being successful.

--- 帖子 #404 ---

MA Lights Explanation My MA and RSI Lights have been explained already and I admit they are a work in progress and possibly a bit confusing. But I do think they can offer us a welcome insight to the higher and lower time frames that we can apply to our trading and hopefully help to keep us right most of the time. The idea is that they are simple - at a glance and without being over-loaded with information, they can aid us in our decision making process. If you are going to use these indicators then make sure you understand them. Add the 5 EMA and 8 SMA along with the 34 EMA and 55 EMA to chart and learn how they work together. Here is a little tutorial on how I think the MA Lights should be applied. This explains the general idea behind them and what you should be looking for. I hope it helps. I have altered the colour of some of the lights for demonstration purposes. Attached Image (click to enlarge) UPDATE: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #408 ---
EURUSD. H4 Template says short. H1 template would also say short because H1 HTF is H4. But M5 template says long and H1 chart also says long. You could have made nice profit trading M5 TF with H1 as HTF. This is why I dont use 2 HTF MA or RSI lights. It can cause conflicting signals and confusion. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #409 ---
You can easily adapt the template to work for you if you want to use more HTF lights but the more you add the harder it may be to find entry. Anyway,it's past my bed time and Im at work in the morning. I hope all my babbling makes sense. My intentions are only to help. Hope to see some more traders grabbing some profits with this strategy soon. I repeat again - Pick 1 currency pair and trade it. You might just be dazzled

Well done on EU. I am also trading EU. You won't get a vote of confidence though with comments like "I need to learn to read charts". The learning process takes time and dedication but does not necessarily take as long as some say. You will get there if you really want to.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I am reviewing some of the MA lights comments that I made in post 407. Mainly regarding the LTF lights. I want to find the best way to use this indicator and I make no hesitations to confirm that it is a work in progress.

thanks a lot

Would you please show us how you use the RSI Lights as well? no need to spend time for screen shots but just explain what is your way for looking to the 4 lights togther.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Here is and example of AU. Right chart is M5. Left chart is M1. Using M5 as the trading TF all 3 ofthe entries marked by the red vertical lines wouldhave worked out and the MA lights would have been in agreeance as described in post 407. I will try to find some examples of the LTF lights keeping us out of potential losing trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I will get to the RSI lights when I can my friend but they are basically another way of receiving the same information about LTF and HTF trends.

Jcat, the meter was part of a paid system called Forex Profit Supreme. You can google it that way to find info on it. There are you tube videos and several thread notes on FF about it. Most versions you will find are decompiled but probably work the same. There are several indicators that also have the system name in them.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks, it is pretty straight forward, in what is says. I just wanted to know what they were basing their judgement on. I'll look into the system you mention, and see if I can dig up anything.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi everyone, I uploaded the indicators: I understand that the custom RSI 8 is meant that when the color is green it is above 50 , when red is is under,correct? But it is not working correctly , it does only change color much later, if you put another (standard) RSI 8 on the chart , you can see this easily. Can anyone check this out Thanks for everyone's input, especially Wizlon

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hello vanupips. Yes it should be green when the chosen RSI closes above 50 and red when it closes below. I have just checked and it seems function properly on my charts. Can you post a chart to show what you are experiencing? Thanks

Glad you got answer. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

My personal focus for the time being is to work on the MA and RSI lights Dashboards. Do we need both on our charts? - probably not. Do we need any on our charts? - probably not but they do provide relevant and useful information. Can they be combined to produce something really valuable? - I hope so. Watch this space.

Well done vanupips and grantmac. Brilliant to see you both making good trades. I have been very busy at work but have still managed to trade using my phone. Every day I am routinely making more money using this system than my daily wage from my full time job (and I'm not in a bad paying job), even when not at my computer. Have a good weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Thanks to wizlon for sharing the system and working to fine tuning it. If you have time over the weekend would you mind posting some more examples of the trades you managed to take? It would really help to get a better understanding of your style and if you don't mind I personally would like any comments you have on the volumer analysis in your decision making as well, if it entered into it. I still have difficulty picking and believing that PA will reach a certain level. Any advice on that? cheers mate, have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Grantmac, This week I will try to post some more of my trades with explanations. I only traded EU last week and my chart looks a mess when I use my orders indicator to show the trades I took. Explaining them all would be a nightmare and I think wouldcause confusion. I have purposely not really mentioned volume too much in relation to my trades because it is not essential or even necessary for this system. But that said I am glad that you are taking an interest in volume and I will try to incorporate it more as the thread progresses. Have you read the pdf that I recommended? It will explain volume, the way that I interpret it, much better than I can. I am also relatively new to volume analysis myself but that pdf was a real catalyst for me. As a scalper, one way that I do like to use my volume analysis is to catch counter trend moves or pullbacks. Im not really sure what you mean about having difficulty picking and believing that PA will reach a certain level. Can you explain?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Regarding volume. Here is what I find makes it interesting. Here is EU M15. Look at that lowest pin bar and the volume associated with it. Without volume it looks very bearish since market open, But why is the highest volume bar also the lowest priced bar? And why is the volume increasing as price gets lower? If you had enough money to influence the markets would you unleash your true selling volume at relevant lows? Is this a push down to take stops and add big longs? I don't know but it's worth keeping an eye on. Just remember, if they are buying, you can never know how low they will drive the price before they are satisfied that they have filled enough longs before driving it up. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Yes, that is interesting. On the 4H chart you can see it is at a level of previous buying as well. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Good observation wizlon32; time will tell. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
One of my favourite ways to analyse volume to try to determine what the big boys are up to is to look at M30 or M15 (and also M5 and M1), zoom out a bit and try to see whether volume has been highest at the recent highs or the recent lows. I have been looking at EU in this way for a couple of weeks now and I think there is buying going on. As far as I can see, it is the lows that seem to be attracting the most interest. I guess we will find out if I'm right or wrong soon enough. Either way there will be a good lesson to learn here. Does anyone agree or does anyone see it differently?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Even if you think there is buying going on on a big scale you can still make money shorting by trading what you see on the smaller scale. Price may "consolidate" for some time so there could be opportunities up and down. Just be careful.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I like that approach to volume analysis as well. i just spent the weekend reading more about form some of the other forums you mentioned previously. Looks like your analysis was right at least for now. I guess its a mater of are they going for a profit run or just moving the price higher to short again. I was watch the 15M chart and missed my entry on the 5M.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Well, after missing the initial EU run I finally got in to the second leg and out. All though I potentially got out a bit early but it was a pretty good trade so I won't get greedy and complain. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Wizlon, I was wondering your current thoughts on this EU consolidation. I have been trying to get a bias using volume but really have no clue at the moment. I guess we need to wait for a break of the range and start trading again. Are you looking at any other pairs this week?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I'm not Wiz, but in another thread, it was mentioned the Fed speaks on the 14th, and things would be pretty (horrible, my words) till then for the EU. Erratic was their words

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Grantmac, sorry for my lack of communication lately. Silly season is upon us and I am literally snowed under with early mornings and very late finishes. I have been trading EU on my phone when I can and I've taken long and short positions which I generally don't hold for too long. Looking at the volume on M15 - I see high volume at the tops of the swing highs yesterday on the way up. I also see high volume at today's high. This could mean short orders are being filled at the highs and longs closed. There is also quite high volume at the most recent (almost current) low so maybe it will go up again. If it does try to see where the volume is coming in. Thats what I see from my phone. Hope it helps but if you stick to the entries using the 34 and 55 EMA with the 3 RSI as we have already discussed here you should be OK. Note: the volume increase at the current low could just be because the US session started so there is a natural increase in volume. Again I will say that I am no expert in volume analysis so we will see.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thanks Jcat, that's good to know.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Wizlon, sorry your so busy but I guess things will quieten down in a week or so. Probably depends on what you do though. Hopefully with your system you can retire and trade full time soon Thanks for your thoughts, I have been keeping an eye on the 1M as well and there seems to be high volume at both extremes of this tight range. I think we just need a break out and trade your system as you suggested and we can all be happy. In the meantime Jcat might be right as well and I might start looking for another pair that has some movement. I will continue to post my trades.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Good Advice - it is probably best to avoid EU for now unless you like uncertainty and volatility. I have been managing a hedged order so thats the reason I maintained my focus on this pair today. Here is a EU M5 chart though to show the importance of key levels. By key levels I mean BNs / BRNs, or whole, half, quarter and three quarter levels. These levels, prices or numbers are natural levels of support and resistance. The yellow rectangles are just there to draw your attention to how price reacted at some of these levels today. The rectangles are slightly above or below so as not to obscure the candles or levels Remember Big Money Players like to take price above these levels to add shorts and below these levels to add longs. The indicator that is showing the levels has been uploaded here already. It is called sweetspotsGOLD. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #458 ---
OK so I said that I was going to be working on the MA and RSI Dashboard that I have on my trading chart. The reason I wanted to work on it was that I was using both and that was too much information; they were providing contradicting information which was not good. Both Dashboards can be used seperately in the way they have already been described but I just want something that is visual, simple and provides actionable information. Here is where I am so far. 34 x 55 EMA Lights - I am going to keep this as my quick visual overview of various time frame trends. It's that simple. I will never make trading decisions based on that or any other indicator alone. Each time frame can be traded in isolation using the system described in this thread regardless of HTF trend. But if you are trading against the HTF trend then scalping may be the best style - that is up to you. 3 RSI above or below 50 level lights - I aim to use this in conjunction with the 34 x 55 lights. The 3 RSI lights will tell me when we have had a pullback on the various time frames. If you don't understand then read the thread and you will understand. Lawgirls Trend Display (arrows) - This indicator seems to be hard coded to the 3 RSI which is very sensitive to price fluctuations. This tells me immediate direction on each TF. Read post 11 on page 1 and you will understand how I apply this indicator in conjuncton with the other indicators in the dashboard. The 34 x55 EMA lights replaces the 14 RSI x 50 level lights in this case. Here is EU H1 with the Dashboard in the top right corner as I have just described. This is what I would consider to be a H1 signal to take notice and maybe check the H1 chart for a chance to go long. (it shows 34 EMA is above 55 EMA. 3 RSI has pulled back below 50. 3 RSI is heading up). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is my template.

Did you download and look at all the indicators and templates? It was previously supplied but we are using a different format now.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Not sure bout that; "how to deliver" may mean "how to remove" or "how to add". This is what I am trying to clarify. Regards.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Not to proceed with this type of talk but "how to deliver" would much more likely mean how to add than how to remove in my personal opinion with limited knowledge of english language.

Hi Wizlon, Just wondering if you are planning to keep this thread going? I know you said in December you were very busy. I have been practicing on demo to trade this method on various time frames and it would be very helpful if you could post a few charts showing trades you have taken, with entries and exits marked. Am sure this would help me and others. It would be a shame to let this thread die as the method seems very good. Thanks Nelson

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Yeah Wizlon, come back we have much trading and some learning to do. I hope you had a good Christmas and New Year.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hello everyone. Happy New Year! To answer your question Nelson, I'm not really sure whether to keep this thread going and here is why; I think the thread is a bit messy which is completely down to me and my desire to continuously improve on my system. I think most traders who come here want a solid and complete system which is tried and tested, good to go and will make trading easy for them and me changing things may cause negativity. The thing is for me, the backbone of the system has never changed so the way I see it things are evolving for the better. Point 4 in post 1 says that my goal here is to develop this trading method for my own use and to help struggling traders if I can but I wonder if my approach here will just confuse people? I normally work away from home but I have been at home for Christmas for the past couple of weeks. I don't have much time for FF when I'm at home and it's not worth upsetting the long haired general by spending my time on here when I should be spending it with my kids but perhaps next week I will post a few ideas and see what the response is like.

Just do this:- 1. Attach your RSI to your chart. 2. Insert a rectangle in to the RSI window. 3. Open the rectangle properties and set the parameters to highlight the levels you want and change the year for the start and finish of each rectangle. Attached Image

Here is a new RSI Dashboard that I have been working on. ( Edited screenshot as Timeframes on left were in wrong order on 1st screenshot ) Attached Image It uses the same indicator twice. Right Dashboard - (trend direction) Set to 21 RSI to show main trend on each TF Colours - green above 50 level. Red below 50 level. Left Dashboard - (pullbacks) Set to 3 RSI to find pullbacks. Colours - Green Oversold (possible Long opportunity). Red Overbought (possible short opportunity). Position = TL (not TR). Timeframes reverse order from right side ofdashboard. Other features Yellow dotted verticle line separates the 2 dashboards. White rectangle is for ease of viewing individual pairs. Just slide up and down. I have adjusted the other settings to suit me (font, font size, position). I can't upload a template because there are issues with the numbers and letters transferring from the mother template on to any new template. Practacle use At a glance identify same colour on same TF on each side of the Dashboard. Green right = Uptrend. Green Left = Oversold = Buy opportunity. You can start on the left by looking for 3 RSI OS or OB and then look right to see if the if it is a counter trend pullback or not. Or start right by looking for a strong trend on several TF and then look left to identify a pullback and potential opportunity. Once an opportunity is identified, open the relevand chart and TF and conduct proper analysis. Attached File(s) RSI dashboard.ex4 36 KB | 276 downloads EDIT: I found a problem with this dashboard (but I have a fix). If like me you put it on a Monthly chart it won't update for a month! If you want it to update every minute then put it on an M1 chart. Every 5 mins then put it on an M5 chart etc. I put it on a Monthly chart so my verticle line and rectangle wouldn't keep disappearing to the left. Also I don't really want it updating every minute or even every 5 mins. I want it to update just before I look for anopportunity and then freeze. To achieve that you can simply change the TF just before you look at it, even if you change from Month to week it will update. The easiest way to do that is to add the symbol changer to the chart as I have done here and click it before you look. Attached Image

Hi Wizlon, Happy New Year to you and all here. I agree with you that the changes and tweaks you have made to the system have evolved for the better since your original post #1. I am not sure about it causing negativity though as I think improvements in a system can only be a good thing. Each improvement may just help traders to see things more clearly. Some of the large threads here on FF, such as PVRSA or TMS for example, do evolve somewhat over time and I think when traders, especially experienced traders, regularly post charts with explanations of their thinking behind trades they have taken it all helps with the learning process for those with less experience. It would be very much appreciated if you have time, to see your trades and ideas. Thanks

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Ok Nelson, thanks for your opinion. Here is a look at where I'm going with my system. Entries are still based on the 3 RSI, but I am prefering the OB/OS levels instead of the 50 level. I am not using any other RSI on my trading chart but I am using my dashboard to spot trends and opportunities. I am using just the 34 EMA on my chart. No others for now. It simply changes colour to display direction or slope. Top right is 34 EMA Dashboard. I am using channels to keep me trading in the right direction. Any of the standard MT4 channels - I just try to use the one that fits best at the time.. The one on this chart is a Fibonacci Channel but the levels are set to 1,-1,2,-2,3,-3. The RSI Alerts Indicator I got from here some time ago. http://www.daxtrader.co.uk/rsi-indic...ert-and-email/ , but it doesn't appear to be available anymore. I took this trade a couple of hours ago before that bearish engulfing candle closed but I am not feeling too confident about it now so I have pulled my SL in tight. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will share indicators and a template when I have more time for those that want it.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Here is the same chart but on M5. I have added another Fibo Channel (blue and yellow) and you can see multiple opportunites to buy. My SL was hit on this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Bullish Channel, Bullish 34 EMA + 3 RSI buy signals are ideal buy conditions and vice versa for shorts. Check any chart and any TF and you will see many opportunities.

Hi Wizlon, great to see you back. I know personally I have learnt a lot from you and I agree with Nelson regarding the thread. Interesting I have made a few minor tweaks myself but it is more about putting information on the chart that I want to use since I can be so forgetful but entirely trying to stick with your overall process. Also, thanks for the dashboard and explanation, I am liking it and it has helped me spot a few setups all ready. This is a trade I have just entered and the template I am using now. I have a couple of higher TF things on it which just helps me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Good stuff Grantmac and thanks for your comments. I considered MTF MAs but decided on the 34 EMA Dashboard instead for a cleaner chart. But if it works for you mate thats what matters! Here is my new template and indicators for anyone who wants it. Just copy the template file to the templates folder and drop all the indicators in to the main indicator folder. As usual I havent included the volume suite or the volume candles suite. Also I can't share my RSI Alerts indicator so I have made something similar the best I can.

A bit about channels. There are several different channels available as standard in MT4 and they all have their uses. I will make a post about each for anyone that is unfamiliar. It is important to understand that 2 people could look at the same chart and apply the same type of channel but pick completely differend anchor points -but it doesn't matter. What matters, in my opinion is that your channel makes sense to you and gives you the confidence to enter trades. I would like to recommend this thread by Eaglestar. When I first looked at it as very new and aspiring trader I found it to be truly enlightening. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=565188 Here is EURAUD H1. I plotted this channel yesterday by lining up with high points 1 and 2. I then moved the yellow centre line to a position that made sense to me. Having just turned my MT4 platform on now I see that point 3 hit my upper TL perfectly and dropped. I would have taken that trade if I was watching it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi Wizlon, Thanks a lot for the RSI Dashboard. Very useful for finding pairs to trade. I was playing around with the "Refresh Period" field in the dashboard settings and found that the numbers will update at whatever value you set, i.e. set to M5 and the numbers update automatically every 5 minutes. I haven't tested the higher values (M15, H1 etc) but checked M5 for a couple of cycles and it works. Setting the value to 0 instead of the default +0 gets real time updates of the numbers, but presumably that will prove to be CPU intensive. Like you I have mine on a monthly chart.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Well done mate. I did try playing around with that setting but it did my head in.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
The Basic Trade You don't need to use any channels for this system. Here is an example of what I will for now call the basic trade. For this method the 34 EMA shows us the direction we want to trade. If its sloping up and price is mainly above it we want to be buyers and vice versa for selling. The last trade in this example would have been a short trade but the rest are longs. On every occasion the 3 RSI is reaching OS/OB levels and then signals by crossing back above or below that level in the direction that we would be looking to trade. The levels I have used here are the 30 for buying and the 70 for selling. You could also use the MACD crossing the signal line for extra confirmation and that could help to filter out some of the bad trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #492 ---
A lot of my trades are taken using my mobile phone when I'm out and about. Not ideal but easy enough. Here is a long scalp that I took earlier for a few pips. The yellow boxes show where I entered the trade. It was a high volume scalp so I just closed when I had a few green pips. Blue line is 34 EMA. Obviously it doesn't change colour when the slope changes so I added a 10EMA of the 34EMA. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

How do you get these dots on the indicator Daxtrader? I would love to see them too. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I mentioned this indicator in post 480. I bought it along with an EA some time ago and there for I am not allowed to distribute it. There is a link in post 480 to where I got it from but it doesn't seem to be available anymore. I read somewhere on the site that the EA has been permanently leased to a hedge fund so I presume the same must be true for the indicator. If anyone can prove that I am infact allowed to share it then I would be happy to.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
I found one but it showes crosses and I don't know how to ajust the levels because they are not set as parameters. Maybe someone can program it. Thanks anyway. :-)

--- 帖子 #498 ---
EURUSD M1 I have been scalping this ranging market for a few pips each time. I have added a standard Deviation Channel set to 2 deviations and I have been trading long and short. I am using the 20 and 80 levels for the RSI. The arrows are produced by my RSI Indicator. I don't normally use them but I have used them here for illustration purposes.

Good find Kofix! I have been looking for something similar to mine to share here but haven't been able to find anything nearly the same. Here is a chart with my indicator (top) and yours made to look like mine. I think yours alerts or displays a cross when the RSI candle closes above or below the level and the candle closes but mine alerts when the RSI croses above or below and then re-crosses in the desired direction and the candle closes. The levels can be adjusted by using the levels tab but it doesn't seem tochange the alerts which defeats the object really. At least you found the source code. Maybe someone could get it changed. Mine has a lot more settings which can be viewed by the following the link I already posted or I will post here if anyone wants to take this on. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Here is an auto linear regression channel indicator. All you need to do is change the number of candles you want it to look back. You can use more than 1 of these on any chart so you could set 1 to look back say 150 candles and 1 to look back 50 or something. I don't use it but I found it yesterday and thought it might be worth sharing. Attached File(s) uLinRegrBuf.mq4 3 KB | 369 downloads

If anyone is looking for a good RSI alerts indicator then why not try FerruFx's Standard indicators which appear in a sub window. They are MTF indicators but you don't necessarily have to use the MTF function if you don't want to. Here are a couple of examples. In the 1st chart I have used the FFx_RSI indicator set to display only my current trading TF. Very easy to customise and will send you alerts too! The second chart is using the MTF function. I have set the TF settings so that the indicators directly below the current price are correct for my trading TF and the next 2 are set to my chosen 2 higher time frames. You can display every TF if you want to. I think I will give this a go. You can get all FFx Standard Indicators here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=418662 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello there guys how are you all I've finished reading the thread, articulating full time job with reading it's not easy eheheh but I finished and I'm here all ready with all set, now I just have to see if all is working properly and then start adjusting . Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS - thanks to all who participated and helped to develop this system look promising. But I would like it more simple but for now I'm sticking to the project then I'll tweak my personal style of it. the Dotted lines are some MA I normally use on my trades they are EMA(close) 48 and 100 why those ? 48 x 5min = 240min (4h) gives an approx perspective of the 4h trend , the 100 I just use it as major sentiment (trend). well basically for now I just want to compare my set with the 34 55. I don't trade the cross anyways they just define the trend/direction/bias thanks again guys

Hi Wizlon and friends are im OK with these spots on chart!? Thanx in advance

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Looks good to me Mizi but your 1st and last sell lines could have been a bar or 2 earlier I think. You should consider using different levels other than the 50 but it's up to you. There is lots of info here and you just need to take what works for you and make it your own. I also sold USDJPY today (on demo) because I wanted to try something out. I am working now but I will post some charts lafter on.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Oh well I manage to observe a good opportunity and took advantage of it Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1st position taken was a counter trend small very aggressive entry my bias is short and I could see observing the candle behaviour and formation that the SM ( smart money was loading short entries above hence why My thoughts here are this retrace was now over. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In here you guys can see there was an accumulation phase but the tops were holding meaning the longs were being absorbed by the selling power. I managed to add positions to build my normal size position that I defined as maximum to trade/manage. it's basically I am willing to risk .5% of trading account per position open. the factors that made me open and load in at this price levels where: current trend direction strong short as we can see by the 34/55 or dotted 48/100 dash board full red confirms the direction of ma. the entries were taken every time the RSI crossed below 50 coming from above it the clear divergence on the RSI indicator I wont include Volume in the analysis or open trade criteria because I still don't know how to interpret it well so I'm learning to see what they say but its not a factor of decision. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Two of the upper positions closed and the lower 2 BE protected free trades... remains with good indication for short direction but theres a good support area 141.06 and ofc its close to a round number so my aim would be exit these two close to that price. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Positions all closed as I don't like the candle formation that buy pin bar at support. 2.1% in profit today I'm happy with that number will keep watching the charts but only a very good setup will pull me in again. Stay safe.

You're welcome Wiz, let's just evolve the system. and learn it. I believe all systems are profitable as long as you have an edge on them , clear rules and specially you just play the game and don't try to win against the big boys, just pigtail them. They are Big boys for a reason, because they are in this business to make money, so we just pick a small amount of their move all the times we spot they are moving .

USDCHF H4 trade that I mentioned earlier. Hope more of you managed to grab some pips! Charts are left to right M5, H1, H4. The 1st chart I looked at was H4 and I noticed that price was below the 34 EMA and had retraced back to it. The 3 RSI was falling from OB levels . I also noticed that the H4 MACD had just turned above the 0 line but was starting to turn down again. Next I looked at H1. On H1 price was above the 34 EMA but there was visible divergence on both the 3 RSI and the MACD. The H1 3 RSI was also falling from OB levels so my bias was short. Just as Zwara done I started to add small positions as price went higher (M5 pulllback) which when added together equaled the maximum that I wanted to risk. I did not look at the M5 TF, I have just shown it here so you can see the individual orders more clearly. Remember, for me this was an H4 trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I mentioned earlier that I shorted UJ on demo. I did that because of something that was on my mind and I wanted to try a little experiment with MACD. So basically I found a pair (UJ) where the MACD was below the signal line on both H1 and H4 and I sold. H4 just crossed and I did also note that H4 3 RSI was heading lower from OB levels. I did not give consideration to anything else. Actually the bar right befote the one i sold on looked like a bullish pin bar but i sold anyway because of what the H1 and H4 MACD was telling me and i didn't look at that chart again for several hours. It was just an experiment and I am not suggesting that anyone trades this way. I just find it a little interesting. I took the trade on an MT5 app on my phone. I can't seem to log in to the same account on my computer to show a decent chart so please forgive the pictures. H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) H4 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

By the way I am quite liking FerruFx's MTF RSI Alerts indicator. You can set it to alert either when price crosses in to or out of your chosen OB/OS levels and get the slerts syraight to your phone. At the moment I am using it to alert me when price crosses in to OB/OS so I have plenty of time to do a bit of analysis.

Good work guys. I missed the USDCHF as it was getting late here. Wiz, I have been looking at the exact same type of pattern for the MACD except I sometimes look at two different settings, which after looking at your charts may coincide with a higher TF.

Good job Zwara. Thanks for that Grantmac. I am going to keep looking in tothe MACD and howitcanbe useful for us. I think we might be at the point where we can start to help each other catch trades. Just look at your chgarts and you will see that this system will help us to catch some really nice moves if we catch them at the right moment. I propose that when we see an opportunity we post a simple and short message to let each other know. The priority would be to get the trade yourself of course but if time permits then a quick heads up would be good. There isn'teven a need to post a chert at that point. Anyone interested?

Hi Wiz, that's a great idea. i would like it if we could all start working together.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Thant's not a bad idea, but also the purpose here is to learn and improve you overall knowledge of the forex markets and not becoming a signal spotter service. I will contribute but I will always leave some analysis behind it. My goal now is to understand that volume assests I have in my charts so I will have a lot to read and to be honest I don't like much reading stuff ahahahah

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I agree, I don't intend to become a tipping service and I think I mentioned that in post 1. My idea is to alert each other of potential opportunities and post charts and analysis later. I will not necessarily say that I am entering a trade, just that I am looking at it. I will however follow up later with a chart even if the trade was a loser in order to aid learning (my own and others). That way each person here has their own responsibility to understand the system and decide for themselves whether or or not to enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
That's a good idea. I agree we can just post ideas and suggestions and we can make comments.

I know you are using MTF MAs but a little look at various TFs migh help you. I shorted GJ around the time you were entering long. For me the H1 TF was looking ripe for selling and it paid off. I didn't say anything at the time because who knows,you could have been right and I didn't want to confuse things. (Just noticed the other green arrows around where I closed my short. They were long scalps in case anyone is wondering) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I quite understand than in a bigger perspective the trend was opposite I am also trying to learn counter trending scalps.... its ok the road to the future is made of ups and downs today was a down day that's fine... no regrets. eheheh

Just to follow up on a previous post, I took a small long position on AJ. If it drops below my initial entry again I may add more although it doesn't seem ready to go. The usual reasons apply - 34 EMA sloping up, 3 RSI heading up from OS levels. The chart below shows another couple of considerations regarding structure and Fib retracement.

I know you understand that. The RSI 50 level isn't ideal for M5 counter-trend scalping. Before you know it the RSI is ready to turn again. Just my opinion.

Also to follow up on another earlier post here is a chart showing some entries I took on EG. I took these positions according to M30 and H1. I was quite lucky here that I managed to close all in profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I hope some of you took advantage of this move!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Closed AJ long. Add a little short. May just be a scalp as I can see this going higher. Edit: Closedeshort for 10 pips on very high M1 volume bar. Don't want tobe greedy and get burned. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Trying a small Long on GU based on the H1 Candle formation and high volume at the lows. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you for sharing your thought, wizlon32

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hope I'm right! Even if it's going to go up it could go lower 1st so be careful.

Looks like AUDUSD might be setting up on the H1 and H4 charts.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Short? Don't like the long option just now personally.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
SL hit.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Oh sorry I was looking at the long option. So how come you didn't like it long? Although you could be right and it might be the start of a downward move.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I thought AU was ready to drop at the time but you were right! I missed the opportunity to buy GU lower down so a bit dissappointed about that. Work tends to get in the way of trading!!lol Here is an example of 1 way I like to observe volume. Look what happens to the volume bar when the candle is dropping towards it. If there are buyers at the lows it almost looks like the volume bar is reaching out to stop the fall and then price goes up. This is buying volume coming in. And the same happens at the highs if there are sellers there. Pity we can't also have volume at the top of the chart pointing down! You can see this on any various TF. This is my interpretation of the volume on this chart. Box 1 - price is pushed down to new lows and buyers are waiting. Just one high volume M1 bar and price stops dropping and starts to climb. But was it just 1 high volume bar that done this or was there also more buying higher up? Box 2 - price comes back to test the lows but again the buyers are waiting. Yes it drops a little bit further but again you can see the volume coming in and supporting it. Price then starts to rise on lower volume. Box 3 - as price drops again the big volume comes in and drives price up. Box 4 - a higher low and more buying volume to keep price moving up. Thats my take anyway. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just small positions so not too risky. PA and volume gave a clue that they were running out of steam. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nice explanation on the volume interpretation. I see that happen a lot but I struggle to identify it early enough to act on it. Nice trades on AUD, I went to bed by that time.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
But you recognise it so thats what counts. It's probably best not to act on it too soon anyway. Just learn to interpret it and it will help to give you your bias. It will help you to jump in in the right direction.

Ohhh this job is killing me so badly, I hardly have time to even come and read here what you guys are doing. Keep the positive energy. trading its not for all its only the ones who persevered and chased their dream. Trade well stay safe.

I think its about time to wrap this thread up. Thanks to those who have contributed. I hope you have at least taken something away from here that you can take forward in your trading; I know I certainly have. I think one of the best and most effective ways to develop yourself is to help others. As stated in post 1, the main aim of this thread was to develop the system. I have done that and in the past 24 hours I think I have taken the biggest and best steps yet (however things look a bit different). Once things are tried and tested a little while from now I might share it with you in a new thread. By then I am quite confident that I will have a solid set of rules for money management and entries plus a nice set of results to show you as well as I am very confident in where I'm heading with this. Take care and trade well.

Well you are the creator so it's up to you to decide, but I still think we have a lot of room to improve. but regardless of my simple opinion I'll respect your decision whatever it will be. stay safe.

Zwara, you are one of the very few people who contribute here. Look at the number of downloads of the various indicators and templates - that tells me something isn't right. Also I think I have just had my "light bulb moment". I have realised a couple of things and have made even more changes. Don't get me wrong I still plan to trade the trend and get in on pullbacks but since yesterday I am seeing things a little differently and I don't think this is the right place to share my ideas - as I said already the thread is already a bit confusing I think. Catch you later!

Hi Wiz. Thank you for creating this thread you have certainly helped me a lot with my trading. I wish the thread would keep going but I do understand where you are coming from and I hope to see more from you in the future. I will try and continue with the philosophy that you have created here. Good trading to all and I hope to see you all again soon. Cheers.
