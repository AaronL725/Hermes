Has anyone run across a strategy called the "4Hr Tunnel System" It really is a model rather than a system. I have not heard anyone discuss it or use it in their trading but when I applied it to historical data....it looked pretty promising to me. I noticed that some of the work that James and Iso have been posting really puncuates the Entry and exit signals provided by this model. I will attach the doc describing this, as the writer expresses that free distribution is OK. I am demoing a version of this now. The "system" is more of a swing strategy I guess but the profit potential looks good if you can .......................................................................................................................Wait I would be very interested in any comments or experience with this strategy if anyone is so inclined to opine. As for now it is an itegral part of the Bonehead Trader Toolbox Thanx HJ

You'll find a modified, improved version of this in the PF when it opens.

Hi, HeavyJ : It was on my list of systems to test. Bolt1 has a variation of that on MT. Scorpion: Thanks for the heads up. Saves me doing the testing Best regards Alan

--- 帖子 #4 ---
execuse me but what is fib numbers I read in article? (144, 233, 377) , hm nice 377 = 144 + 233. Does fib means fibonacci? thanks

--- 帖子 #5 ---
fib does mean fibonacci in my understanding. That alone should give pause

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you Scorpion, this is correct. I first traded the model several months ago with mixed results. The brief comment in the model document about it being vulnerable to losses during trend changes is an understatement! Fortunately, shortly after this, I was invited to join an exclusive group of brilliant and dedicated traders whom I'll refer to as "Team Aphid" since they wish to remain anonymous. Team Aphid had developed a system from the model that they were trading with great success. I have taken their system and have made further improvements of my own, and named the system "Knife". This is the system I will be teaching in the PF and is the same system I used to win the 1770 pips in 18 days that I mentioned recently in the "100 Pips a Month" thread. In addition, I am currently developing and testing an ancillary system to be used in conjuction with the Knife system during trend changes, to further enhance profits and reduce losses. I have submitted the initial draft of the system to Team Aphid for review. If this ancillary system tests well, I plan to include it in the PF at a future date. I must say, that the members of Team Aphid are some of the nicest, kindest and most generous people it has been my pleasure to encounter. Would that the World was populated entirely with people such as these!!! Diallist

Hi 777, Yes fib does mean Fibonacci. The fib numbers are used as dynamic "take profit" levels. I will be explaining how to use them in detail in the PF. Dial

--- 帖子 #8 ---
WOW!! Thanx Charles at least you give some creditability to the merits of exploring this strategy. Warnings duly noted. I would not have you divulge specifics about your system here. Nor do I believe you should. I am curious if the model you tried before developing the Knife was indeed the 4Hr or 1Hr version of the tunnel The reason I ask is because when I looked at the 1 Hr tunnel, I sort of dismissed it out of hand because of the "chop" at the tunnel. (I think this is what you were referring to) This would knock me out of tacos and beer pretty quick! The 4hr tunnel seemed to greatly reduce this dynamic. I appreciate and value any comment you can make to this Thanx HJ

Have patience, Grasshopper, and all will be revealed in the PF.

from the tunnel profile...have i picked out a signal on the 4h? http://img494.imageshack.us/img494/4...ekly9gw.th.gif http://img494.imageshack.us/img494/6861/4h8il.th.gif

--- 帖子 #11 ---
If I knew this system a few days ago I would not have missed this trade.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Here are some words of wisdom from Team Aphid's head developer regarding the 50 pip rule on the 4 hour tunnel model. To help you visualize this, I've added the chart below. The 55 SMA &amp; 8 SMA are within 50 pips of each other. I've drawn two horizontal lines. The green line is 50 pips above the lower SMA (the 8 SMA in this case), and the red line is 50 pips below the upper SMA (the 55 SMA in this case). If price is between these boundaries, don't take any trades. If price moves outside these boundaries, there are two ways to play it: First, you can simply play it as a breakout and enter a trade in the direction indicated by the weekly chart trend direction. Second, you can simply treat price being outside the boundaries as an indication that it's OK to start looking for slope change signals again. I use either the first or second option depending on what price action on the 4 hour looks like. Sorry, this part is discretionary and I would be hard pressed to explain it in general terms. We can have discussions in the PF for particular situations. Does this help or confuse? Dial

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yeah! me too. But I satrted marking up my charts and looking in earnest. Vegas describes reentry or position adds on a hook of the fast line in the direction of the major trend. He only uses 1/2 positions for these. attached is a lamebrain demo play I made the other night made 60 pips then whimped out! anywho I'll be posting that fiasco in the hall of shame over on "The bonehead trader" journal thread. Oh yeah as of the last 4hr bar on the USDJPY a reversal hook may be forming. who knows ....a re-entry hook may form after that. Please continue to post your thoughts! HJ

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks Dial! I'm stoppin at the liquor store on the way home and gonna take a better look tonight. U-da-best HJ

--- 帖子 #16 ---
thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
But may be my question is dumb question but why lower 8 SMA is 0.7495. I understand why upper 55 is 0.7515 because the highest price is 0.7515 in this period but lower price where 8 Sma goes is 0.7500. Please can you clarify it for me?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Also may be I am deadly wrong but you mention that weekly trend is up and to initiate long position upper boundary must be broken. I am confused was not weekly chart down? again thanks and sorry to dusturb.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi 777! Oops! You caught me! I made a mistake. You are correct. The weekly trend is down as you said. I've corrected the graphic in my post. Good catch 777! Dial

--- 帖子 #20 ---
that's just automatical mistake. Sometimes happening in real life. you are right man I see how price broke lower boundary and immediately went down. Good filtering. thanks again and wish you good trades. Looking forward to PF

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi 777, I'm not sure I understand your question. I don't know what you mean when you say that the 8 sma price goes to .7500. I'm sorry I don't understand your question. There are no dumb questions, only dumb answers : I've made some notes on your chart to clarify how the boundaries are calculated. Only the SMA values are used. Price is not used in the calculations. Read Team Aphid's explanation in my earlier post as to why price is ignored. If you still don't understand, just ask again. Thanks Dial

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hey Iso, Best as I can tell I you missed it by one bar. I'm glad you scribbled up your chart.... I havent paid much attention to "pendant and consolidation action" as it relates to momentum...duh. still I think its a cool xover set up. profit taking calculations are dynamic and recalculated every bar I scribbled one up for ya below HJ

--- 帖子 #23 ---
thanks for clarifying for me. Now I understand why 8SMA is 0.7495 thanks again

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thankx HJ - Looks like I haven't grasped the finer points of this system yet. I'll reread all this thread again. Are those indicators I sent any good? They should help to visually capture the falling or rising momentum between two MAs (like any good MACD should do). I took the MACD code and modified it for this system. Also I spotted a bug on the 4h code - change an EMA to SMA during the calculation near the end.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hey guys, Try this. Dial

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Great explanation!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hello guys, can someone explain to me what the "PF" is? It is mentioned several times in this thread.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I can't get Meta 4 to work right, Just got it with IBFX- This one is live for micros--can't use it Keeps freezing up and shit. Meta 3.82 runs like a damn clock, I don't get it. Playin with customs were one of the reasons I wanted to get Version 4. Now they got all my coke bottle money. that's ok I havent seen an entry for a while. Your indies looked pretty good The tracked the Cross pretty nice and I like the flip on the greater trend.(weekly) Now, how am I gonna get an oscillator to monitor the weekly chart stuff at the bottom of my 4hr chart. I really only have been checking that chart weekly and applying an corresponding arrow indicator on the 4 hr... Anywho. things are gettin choppy, cables droppin like a rock.......its 6:45 and I gotta go fix the toilets! Stay in touch hj

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Dial thanx so much for contributing to this discussion. Yes that was kewl. I won't begin to describe the boneheaded, convoluted way I was getting to the same result. You have so much invested in your studies and have been plugged into this line of thinking far longer than the rest of us. So I for one am ready to pick up any scraps that might fall off your table. I hope we can get into the Knife on the PF soon. James' post yesterday on Jan. release was in a sense disappointing. In another way it should help tame the angst and anticipation vibe which was really boiling! Once again, Thanx so much for sharing in this thread, you have already enriched those of us who are interested in the merits of the "original system" and have warned us of important pit falls. HJ

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I would be very careful with the tunnel method, when I first read about it online I got excited, especially with the author's backtesting results. I plugged it into TradeStation however, and found they forgot to mention many of the losses the system had, and overall the system lost money due to the chop around the tunnel. The 4hr, the 1hr, daily, I tried all the combinations and the various iterations of the different tunnel systems, none of them could produce stable profits. They'd have a few really huge wins, and a lot of littles losses that would dwarf the gains. Plug this in and backtest it on any number of pairs and you'll find results are the same. It sounds great on paper, but in reality it falls quite short. -Aksel

--- 帖子 #31 ---
yes, the 1 hr had a problem with chop around the tunnel. the 4hr is not a "tunnel" system so to speak as the 1hr. it was developed to address the chop issue. i have rarely seen a more stable profit system than the 4hr tunnel. at least that has been my results so far. i have been trading it on daily/1hr charts in addition to the way it was designed. when combined with price action and dials adjustments it has the potential to be one of the best systems i have ever seen, and i have seen a bunch. one of the neat things about charles section in the pf will be the ability for subscribers to participate in the ongoing developement of the system. i plan to spend a lot of my time in charles section for this very reason. personally i have moved many of my trading systems to the rear for a while and am concentrating on this system. it can be tweaked in a variety of ways and if the tweaks keep making it better it could reach great status, and i dont throw that term around loosely. i have rarely been as excited about a system as i am this one. if entry risk and timing issues can be resolved it will be outstanding. only time will tell. the process should be fun because i am having great success with it already. my ideas and fine tuning are totally seperate from charles and when the time is right in the pf i will submit my findings to charles and subscribers for thier review and embelishment. as i said its going to be a lot of fun to see where this can go. you may have heard charles speak of team aphid, i was a part of this team so my opinions and understanding of this system goes deeper than just reading the material. no offense at you bob im sure your results were what they were. im just having good success with this system or variations thereof and throwing in my opinion. jim

--- 帖子 #32 ---
What an excellent reply Jim! You said it so well. Would that I were half as good at getting my point across sometimes! Jim, you said: I think this will be the most fun and exciting part of my section of the PF! I don't consider myself a super guru trader, and I certainly don't have all the answers. So, I am looking forward to the constructive interaction of the subscribers to make the already good Knife system even better, as Jim said. But, it isn't necessary to wait until the PF opens to begin. HeavyJ and Isotonic have both provided links in this thread to the original vegas tunnel 4h model. If you have any questions or ideas, post them in this thread and we can all have a go at it. For those of you planning on joining the PF, I want to assure you that whatever happens in this thread will not detract from my part of the PF. That is because the value of the PF will be in the ongoing personal support, encouragement and group camraderie, moreso than the formal tutorial I'm putting together, or future systems I may add. And who knows! Some of you may suggest an improvement that may find its way into my tutorial as a permanent feature. Credit given where due of course! Profitable Trading All Dial

--- 帖子 #33 ---
A note/warning: that Moneytec thread begins with a discussion of the 1 Hour Tunnel, and quickly morphs to a highly modified version for 5 minute charts. Most of the discussion is probably not relevent to the 4 Hour Tunnel or closer modifications such as the Knife (though of course I don't know all the details of the Knife)...Just thought I may save someone the time of reading 60+ pages of discussion.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks FXLogic for the warning. The info may be good or bad, I don't know. But I do know that a 5 minute discussion is not relevant to the 4 hour model or derivatives such as the knife. For myself, I have found that longer time frames are more profitable. That's why I stayed with the 4 hour time frame. I'd rather pick $5s and $10s off the sidewalk than nickles and dimes. And, I'll really be interested to see Jim's daily version when he's ready to share it. Might be able to pick up $50s and $100s then! Less stooping, more money. What's not to like. Take care FXLogic! Dial

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Yeah from the first page it quickly dropped into smaller timeframes which kinda disappoints but I'll need to spend some time working through all the pages before I make a judgement.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I was also thinking perhaps a daily &amp; weekly or monthly combination by tweaking all the parameters. The code should speed things up during development. I didn't like the colour schemes so thats the first thing to go! The mechanical filtering and simplistic rules I find appealing so I could possibly follow this for intraday as well. Well its back to the research lab for this one. (PS: This is where Merlin's stuff on system dev should kick in!)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Aksel, Very curious post, It would be important to know if you included all filters in your TS model such as the 50 pip rule Dial talked about earlier. (EUR/USD is in that zone right now and looks a bit suicidal). Your results are suprising to me, Take a look at how Team Vegas handled losses in the analisys sec. They treated 100 pip gains as losses? They doubled actual losses. Just curious how closely your backtesting followed all the rules of the system' You may have nailed it I don't know. I will say that I dismissed the 1hr tunnel for me because of the chop..Looks ulcerous! Thanx for you input HJ

--- 帖子 #38 ---
The moneytec thread, although a fairly good system is really nothing to do with the tunnel system, it is an intraday system trading only the start of the US session (generally trading the 8.30 news release when high volume is present and other system rules are in place. Not a bad system but not the Tunnel, the thread title is a misnomer.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hey Man, I think I got MT4 cooking. I want to get into the programming aspects. sure looks Daunting. I was curious The classic MACD is based on EMAS can that be changed? I liked the flip effect that your custom MACD had but elected not to use it so My focus would remain up in the Chart Action...BUT.......I was think'n...Uh Ohh A very useful MACD type histogram for the 4hr chart might be this: There are 42 4hr periods in one week so would it be possible to develope a histogram that based on 42 x 55 EMA (HL)/2 = 882 EMA (HL)/2 (slow) &amp; 42 x 5 SMA Close = 210 SMA Close (fast) Would'nt this kinda juxtapose the weekly chart data on the 4hr charts in real time and provide a "ballpark" indicator of the weekly chart data on the 4hr. I can think of a bunch a stuff this would be helpful with Let me know what you think.......may just be a Bonehead idea! And after all...... you were probably lookin for something else to do any way right? Thanx HJ

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I've edit this to remove my misreading of the original spec. Still the MACD is general enough for to work on any timeframe.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks Iso, i'm at the Grind now~ I'll have a look and get back with you when I get home! HJ

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Actually I may not have made myself clear here. I am looking for an oscilalator to bring the Weekly chart data up on the 4hr Chart. As you back test the 4hr chart you have to keep checking the weekly cross to see if signals are valid. It was my hope that an aproximation of this dynamic might be accomplished in real time.....way i'm doin it now!......Loooooong time! see ya. HJ

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hey there Iso! I'm an MT4 newbie, so bear with my "ignernce". I can see that tunned.zip contains an indicator, but what is tunnel.zip for and how do I install it and use it? Thanks Iso! Dial

--- 帖子 #44 ---
just adjust the time parameter on the paticular instrument of interest to fit the target output timeframe. for example... 100sma on 1hr charts, and you want the same values on 30 min chart.. just make it 200 sma and the value of the instrument remain the same.. then u can aviod having to flip back to weekly all the time rgds..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi all! Methinks the GBPUSD bears watching. Check out the chart I've attached. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. Please don't enter early. Wait for the actual signal. Take care Dial

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Even though the 4 hour chart is giving indications of a signal to the upside, I've got to warn you that the change of trend to up being indicated on the weekly may be a false indication. See the chart below. This is NOT a mechanical system. The best "indicator" is between your ears, not on the chart! Dial

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanx Dial- Point well taken. The Vegas doc speaks of the Weekly Momentum indicator as "lagging" by one week. I have been wondering about the value of logging the dif of current weekly bar at each 4hr period. Seems to me that this would have more value at times like now when the week is running out. Anywho, another challenge I have to face is the trade opportunities that I miss while I'm at work.....fixin the toilet's as I said! I track this stuff all night and it breaks out while I'm clocking in at the grind! Your eight bar count tip has helped me considerably Iv'e been waking through the night at the 4 hourlies to check them. Now I can set my alerts to do this with price action. Thanx again HJ

--- 帖子 #48 ---
My turn to be the bonehead. I don't understand what you mean. Could you expand on this idea a bit? Man, do I ever know what you mean. It's hard to use forex to escape the grind, when the grind is keeping you from forex. Jim mentioned he's trading this system on the daily charts. Although I haven't tried it yet, you might want to use the daily and monthly charts in place of the 4 hour and weekly ones. That way you only have to check your "eight count" once a day. You'll need bigger stops obviously, but you should also get proportionally larger wins as well. You're welcome! Charles

--- 帖子 #49 ---
FYI, I've corrected the chart in post #26. It was off by one bar. Neutral point crossover has to occur during the current bar. I had drawn it on the next bar which was not correct. Sorry for any confusion. I also colored the bars to the right of the current bar gray since they are in the future relative to the current bar. This was a good trade. Too bad I missed it. Dial

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Sorry for the misunderstanding. I've removed my errors from my post (#42) and your post quoting my mistakes so that latecomers dont make the same mistakes. On MT the week runs from Sun 2200 GMT to Fri 2100 GMT - 119 hours or nearly 30 bars on the 4hr. So if you use the indicator attached use 30 as the multiplier, or 29.75 and round up or down the result. e.g to bring in weekly values of 21long &amp; 5 short then you would get 630 &amp; 150 respectively using 30 multiplier. I've actually done this using the standard MA's and for intraday values then you get matches like dvst1 suggested but if you try matching up daily or weeky with intraday timeframes you get discrepancies so the realtime idea might not work. Somebody might need to check my findings and confirm this though.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sorry for these edits - I dont want others to fall into my trap! Ignore the tunnel.zip. Thats just a profile showing the indicator in action. But since I misread HJ's intentions its of no use. The indicator should still serve its purpose as a MACD function but see my last post on caveats.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Nice diagram, thanks Dial! I will look to program in this filter at some point...must be a chore doing this manually all the time.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks for your insights on this system, Dial! Is it correct to assume that the Tunnel/Knife method works on all currency pairs and maybe even other markets (futures, equities,...) as well? Looking forward to the pf more than ever! Finding out about the Knife method alone is worth the price of admission IMHO.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Well, this is just my opinion, but when it comes to the markets, I never assume anything. Always test with demo trading first. I suspect this system will work well in a variety of markets but may require some modifications. Give it a try and let me know what you find out! It should work with any currency pair that has sufficient volatility to hit the fib levels fairly frequently. Thanks for asking Blue Dial

--- 帖子 #55 ---
If I'm understanding this all correctly, it seems like a really great system. I read through this whole thread, and didn't see who exactly devised it. Do they have a website? I apologize if this was addressed and I missed it. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Mr Wigs. Hello, If you haven't done this allready go to the first post in this thread and read the entire document attached at the bottom. This is the model document for the original system. Team Vegas is the name of the developers group. I am not sure if they have a web site but the Model document is complete and a great place to start. I am still in study mode but am progressing rapidly because we have absolute experts on this system who have been monitoring this thread. (Diallist, James 16) I believe Isotonic has taken an interest as well so we hopefully will get some more goodies from him. Umm errr... I don't fall in the category of those heavy weights but after studying this system for weeks thier inputs have propelled my understanding exponentially over 2 days! It was my hope in starting this thread to have a fruitful discussion of this great system and so far it has exceeded my expectations. by far! welcome aboard HJ

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I'm glad you started this thread HeavyJ. And just to say thanks, here's some more fruit! :

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Iso Thanx again for the help! sorry it took so long to get back with you but I was sneakin peaks at this thread at work today and I had a bunch of chart/study stuff to handle when I got home. I should apologize to you. I gave you the wrong set of indicators and you did exactly what was infferred. I get the bonehead biscuit on that one! Thanx for the MT week correction I ran the 630 over 150 ema medians on the MACD and cancelled the signal line. Looks good I'm gonna leave it on my 4hr template to "play with". If only I could make the 150 sma----I could be truly happy. Some time I know....I have to get into the programming aspect of this system. Thanx Again Iso HJ

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Yes Master! Thanx to you I'm on it! How bout that Swissie? Shaping up? Maybe? HJ

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I've increased the neutral filter from 20 to 30 pips to get the entry stop below the trendline I just noticed. It wouldn't do to have the order trigger at 20 just to bounce off the trendline and start losing.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thats odd! My Interbank chart doesn't match yours. Notice how my ema cross has yet to happen I doubled checked my indicators too! HJ

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Swissie's next signal looks like it's going to be a secondary one. Assuming the trendline that's just above the first fib line holds, there may be room for a little profit if you play it very carefully. Personally, I'm going to wait for swissie to drop below the 55 and take the next primary signal. That's just me.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I'm using MetaQuotes data feed, which may account for the difference. I don't know.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Both should be SMAs, not EMAs

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanx Matsu. Another bonehead blunder. That'll do it every time HJ

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Dial, Can you help me out on the understanding of trend determination? I've read thru the vegas doc and gone thru all these posts and it seems that you are using a different method of determining the trend. In post #50 you mention a potential trend change on cable using the current weeks ma's and the previous weeks ma's. In the vegas doc they mention the trend lags by at least a week. During a current week they use the prior weeks ma's and the week before that and don't use the current weeks ma's until the week has fully completed. Can you confirm the method you are using for trend determination or do you use a combination of both methods using yours towards the end of the week? Also, can you give me an idea of what size stops we can expect to use with this method on cable? Thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Dial, Please leave the bonehead stuff to us pros, your not ready! As to what I meant Here Sort of dovetails with riveras last post. This is the part of the Vegas Doc we were both reffering too Now the second thought I eluded to: Boy. as I read that I get confused! But you had mentioned or rather inferred, on a chart example, as Rivera pointed out, measuring Current Momentum data from the Weekly Chart before the current bar was complete. My comment was that I had been curious about this practice and if it would be valueable The "week running out" part has to do with the fact (?) that as the Weekly sample becomes more complete (Friday 4pm est) that bar will or should be a better sample. In other words when the bar opens first tick. open and close will probabbly be within one tick of each other and this would polute your bar to bar deviance. I have got to get some coffee I hope I haven't further confused you Have a good day! HJ

Dial Doesn't the 50 pip filter apply here? Therefore entry would be 8sma-50 pips.Tom

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I think if by "the exclusion zone" you mean the fifty pip rule. The Doc says you should fall back to technicals for open? So I think Dials respect of the lower trend line on the AUDUSD would be valid to the system. But then again ...consider the source...me not Dial HJ

--- 帖子 #71 ---
i have two more goodies for you chaps to play with! : the first indicator is just a rework of the original with the scaling magnified by 10^4 to make the MACD easier to read. so for the audusd the diff between the two ma's is now 133 pips instead of the cryptic 0.0133 you normally see. the second one calculates the difference over the last week in pips so that again we get 133.52 - 116.33 = 16.19 pips. just hover the mouse over the last two bars on each of the indicators (i've increased the thickness to 5) so you can see the actual values themselves. i will look at the vegas scripts at some point, particularly the expert one, and see if there is anything worth "borrowing" http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/2341/4h9kw.th.gif

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Excellent observation riveria! Yes, Vegas Team does calculate the weekly trend based on the two most recently completed bars. They perform their calculation at the end of each week after the market closes on Friday. I would use this method if I were trading the system mechanically. But, because I choose to trade with discretion, I want to know what the status of the trend is in realtime. With the original Vegas Team method, trend state is binary. It is either up, or it is down, and trades would always be taken in the matching direction. I traded the original model this way until I encountered my first trend change that occurred on several currencies at the same time. I got my butt kicked trading with the Vegas trend when the actual market was moving the opposite direction. That emphasized for me Vegas Team's statement that the model was vulnerable to losses at trend changes. Since then, I monitor momentum in realtime. When I see momentum decrease I don't automatically start trading in the opposite direction. I use the decrease as an alert to keep a close watch on the combined price action of the weekly and 4 hour charts. If the momentum says the opposite of what the weekly bars are saying, I give precedence to the weekly bars in determining trade direction. As for stops on cable. Currently, I set most of my stops a couple of pips beyond the last swing high/low prior to the trade signal. On cable this usually yields a stop in the range of 50 to 100 pips. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I then adjust my position size accordingly to keep within my percent risked limit. For a while the 100 pip stops really bugged me because it caused my position size to be too small to keep me happy. I tried setting my stops to a maximum of 50 pips, but I got stopped out so frequently, that I just bit the bullet and decided to stick with the recent swing high/low. As I gain additional experience with this system, I expect my stop loss methodology to become more refined. Again, great observation and question riveria! Dial

Good catch caminus! You are absolutely right! Since the intent of my post was to demonstrate how trailing entries could be based on an upcoming neutral line, I wasn't paying attention to the proximity of the SMA's. Good job caminus! Keep it up! (See HeavyJ? I are so too a qualified bonehead!)

Hey Iso! I'm really liking your comments about discretion! Good use of the intra-aural indicator! Dial

That's so cool Iso. I read somewhere that these equilateral pendants break in the direction of the previous trend @ 62% of the time. Has that been your experience? You got tons more chart and scribble time than I! Also I'm gonna go back to James chart thread this weekend to see how or if he would play the pinbar formed yesterday on the daily. Checkout chart below Also I'm up to my 3rd day I guess on MT4 maaaaaan what an upgrade. I intend to disect your indicators 'cause I ain't gettin' it yet. (the programming aspect that is) Your last improvement looks great (10^4) I'll probably fly that into my template today. Have a good day HJ

Iso, Could you help me out? How do I install/load/use these indicators? Thanx HJ

Here's a small article that may help you: http://www.professionalforex.com/for...topic.php?t=12 As well as: http://www.professionalforex.com/for...wtopic.php?t=7 Trend is not overly difficult to determine especially one you've trained you eyes to spot it. It's kinda like missing the forest for the trees. I'm a huge believer and proponent of new traders learning the Dow Theory. It helped me tremendously as a new trader and I think it's vital to overall success. I can now spot most trends easily without the aid of lines, channels, crystal balls, or chicken bones. Though the chicken bones do help somewhat with price action! All of this is because of training myself to see the general direction and the patterns that fit into the theories. Of course, staring at charts for endless hours is the only way to accomplish this as well as verifying your results with someone you trust. Once that is done, you'll wonder why you had such a hard time with it! ~MuddBuddha

Hi Mudd! How's one of my favorite geniuses doing? Thanks for the articles. Very useful for seeing where the trend is, and conversely, where the trend isn't. I think the latter part is useful with this system because even though the Vegas method of using momentum measurements to determine trend is right on 90%+ of the time, it is when that "indicator" disagrees with the market that too many losses can occur. I appreciate your taking time to comment. Thanks! Dial

--- 帖子 #82 ---
equilateral pendants!? do you mean a symmetric triangle!? If you mean the triangle thing then it depends on what kind. I see s symmetric formation which are neutral in bias so they are tricky to read. Ascending triangles have an upward bias and conversely negative ones downwards. I don't have any hard statistics on breakout directions, sorry! I've looked at the chart and, forgive me, I don't quite see the pinbar you mean. I can see the last bar you've highlighted but I'm not sure what you mean. Could you perhaps highlight the 3 bar formation?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Just unzip them to the experts/indicators folder under the Interbank installation folder (normally under c:/program files for a default install). You might have to restart the terminal to pick them up. Thats should be it!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I agree with you that all newbies should learn the Dow Theory. It helps you out when you're looking at trends on different timeframes. Also many systems that screen this way borrow heavily from the theory in terms of 1st screen (macro or primary), 2nd (intermediate or secondary) and 3rd (micro or tertiary). Dr Elder built his Triple Screen system around it in fact. I first saw some resemblances of the tunnel to that system earlier on. Nice articles Mudd, although I think I've seen them somewhere before!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Yup! Sorry! Last thing I read on bars, may have been candle sticks called these pendant formations. Your label is more pervasive! The last bar on the chart. The hammer would that not be considered a pinbar (bullish)? I guess the next bar could gap out site at open! Thanx HJ

Here's a handy slope magnifier....

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Someone asked the following via a PM to me. They wanted to know about the Loonie (USD/CAD). They said they understood that the trend had changed from down to up, but were not sure whether they should take long positions until after the crossover of the 21 EMA and the 5 SMA. Answer: As soon as a momentum change indicates a change in trend, you start taking positions in the direction of the new trend immediately. You do not wait until crossover occurs. Sometimes, you don't get a crossover between trend changes. And, while most trend changes are indicated by a decrease in momentum, there are some occasions where the trend change is marked by an increase in momentum. The Loonie (USD/CAD) might be about to present such a scenario in the next week or two. Here are the two sequences that mark a trend change. The first is when a decrease in momentum marks the trend change, and is the one you'll see most of the time. The second sequence occurs less frequently and is characterized by an increase in momentum marking the trend change. First Trend Change Sequence 1. Momentum continues to increase from week to week indicating the current trend is still in place. 2. Momentum decreases from one week to the next indicating a trend change has occurred. 3. Momentum continues to decrease until a crossover of the 21 EMA and 5 SMA occur. 4. Crossover Occurs 5. Momentum begins to increase following the crossover. 6. The next decrease in momentum marks another trend change. Second Trend Change Sequence 1. Momentum continues to increase from week to week indicating the current trend is still in place. 2. Momentum decreases from one week to the next indicating a trend change has occurred. 3. Momentum continues to decrease, but then ..... 4. No Crossover Occurs. 5. Instead, momentum begins to increase again marking the beginning of a new trend. 6. The next decrease in momentum marks another trend change. Perhaps the image below will help illustrate this. If you are not clear on the two sequences, let me know. Dial

Jim, This is in reference to post 102 above. A few weeks ago, I sent you a message (PM or email, I forget which), that I no longer have a copy of and I was hoping you might still have a copy. It was where I listed all the places in the Vegas 4h document that implied that the trend begins as soon as you get a change in momentum and it is not necessary to wait for the crossover before trading in the direction of the new trend. Do you by chance still have a copy of that message? If so, could you email it to me so I can clean it up and post it here. Thanks Jim

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Your posts are certainly most useful and informative. I was thinking in the scenarios you gave is there the following option that perhaps negates the weekly downtrend? Third Trend Change Sequence (Negation and Reversal) 1. [-ve] Momentum continues to increase from week to week indicating the current trend is still in place. 2. [-ve] Momentum decreases from one week to the next indicating a trend change has occurred. 3. [-ve] Momentum continues to decrease until a crossover of the 21 EMA and 5 SMA occur. 4. Crossover Occurs 5. [-ve] Momentum continues to decrease and crosses over the centre line (0) and becomes +ve. 6. Now the [major] weekly trend is up. 4 or 5 are interchangeable in sequence? So now we look for long opportunities on the 4h and buy on the dips instead?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Sorry Iso, but I am totally lost. What center line? How can momentum continue to decrease after the 8/55 crossover? If I'm driving toward a street sign, it gets closer until I pass it, then it gets further away. What I'm hearing you say is that the sign gets closer even after I've passed it. I'm lost. Picture please? Thanks Dial

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Here ya go Dial: http://img464.imageshack.us/img464/9...dcad2qu.th.gif Earlier on you were talking about weekly MAs (5/21) and now you mention the 4h (8/55), so I'm a bit confused as well!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Sorry Iso, I meant 5/21. I still don't get what you mean. If the crossover has occurred, or even if the 5 just barely touched the 21 and bounced off, the momentum is going to increase, not decrease. One of us is confused and I suspect it's me! Thanks Dial

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I think we're both confusing each other in a negative loop somehow! : My third point means that for instance on the USDCAD the long term weekly (and hence monthly) trend is down. That means -ve momentum rules the roost and +ve momentum is generally weak counter moves that don't often break the centre line and continue as strong moves. In other words they don't go on to negate the long term downtrend and start a new uptrend. Your first two scenarios were I think written from the context of this down trend, hence momentum increasing when the downtrend resumes or picks up speed and conversely decreasing when the downtrend pauses (consolidates) or retraces (uptrend resumes again, if only weakly). I differentiated the momentum in this respect into +ve or -ve so they can be freed of the weekly context. At some point even for the loony it might undergo a significant and sustained reaction to the long term down trend and thus the 3rd scenario would kick in. Another chart might help here answer more questions: http://img462.imageshack.us/img462/7...pusd2nb.th.gif I find the MACD a useful indicator for what you guys are doing here. Dynamic momentum calculation and I've thrown in the weekly gradient to boot. It saves you calculating by hand the weekly values (apologies if you've automated this bit). Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thanks for the clarification Iso. I think we are talking about the same thing, but using different terminology to describe it. For me, there are still only two possible scenarios: (1) Two consecutive momentum changes with an intervening crossover. (2) Two consecutive momentum changes without an intervening crossover. I think for the purposes of this system, the direction of the momentum, is irrelavent. Only the magnitude is important. But I could be wrong. If you still believe there is a third scenario that I'm missing, feel free to try again. But for now, I'm happy with just my two. Thanks Iso Dial

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I think with our circular arguments we'll meet up somewhere eventually. I've looked at your first post on this (#102) and it seems to me that you're talking about relative momentum, whereas I'm taking about absolute momentum. So your example talks about increasing and decreasing momentum with respect to the weekly downtrend. You highlighted the turning point in the weekly trend from down to up and labelled that as decreasing momentum, and when the up trend was over then momentum increased again. With relative models the terminology breaks when the model breaks or is flipped over. So for example say the up trend carries a long way so that it doesn't become feasible to talk about decreasing moment wrt to a down trend since the trend itself has changed long term from down to up. For example right now with the USDCAD the major or primary trend is down with corrective or secondary trends up. But there may come a point where there may come about an equilibrium and then reversal from down to up long term. Hence scenario 3. With absolute momentum you split the relative terminlogy into -ve + ve terms instead to deal with this and traditionally this is what the MACD histogram does [to deal with this limitation]. But you still need to make judgement calls on weak reversals that just hover around the centre line. I think my definitions and terms are probably just confusing the issue and/or topics being discussed here and I might still be wrong in my assumptions of your posts so I will respectfully defer to your terms instead! Much easier all round I think - after all you've investigated this sytem far longer than me so you're probably correct after all!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
You are far too kind and give me more credit than I deserve, but thank you! Hmmm....I have a sneaky suspicion than what you said here may apply to the 500 pip (not 50) rule on the weekly chart. Anyhoo, I'm brain-burnt now. Iso, I hope you have a wonderful holiday weekend! (Assuming your in USA). Dial

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Happy thanksgivings my american chums! Go easy on the turkey now!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Right chaps, time to get serious! : I've added a few more toys to play with: a template for all the indicators so you can quickly zap a 4h chart into a tunnel (tunnel.tpl). Put the template in the main templates folder (strange that!). two more new indicators for the 4h chart - one that picks up the close for the 8sma from 8 bars back and the other marks the exclusion zone above and below the ma's for price when both are within the zone In the usual Iso way, nothing is fully tested so report all bugs back please!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Cable shows the zones as well as the close line, euro doesn't show zones. The zones for both are 50 - check the MAs on the right and check the close on the gray line is from 8 bars back (counting from 0 for the current one). The indicators below show weekly macd (gray), weekly macd diff (yellow) and 4h macd (red). If you don't want 'em then remove and resave template. All parameters are up for tweaking have fun! http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/4...pusd6de.th.gif http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/3...rusd5mt.th.gif

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Another way perhaps of doing this is to use a 4h macd, set the fast one to 8sma on close as usual and just set the other to all 0 so you in effect get a plot of just the 8sma zoomed in. No need to draw anything...might be easier to see as well. See white lines on chart below: http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/6...pusd8uh.th.gif

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Haven't fully tested it yet but if you just plonk on the template on any chart, tweak parameters as appropriate then most of the legwork should be taken out for you. One more question on all these parameters - has anybody actually tweaked MA values, zone values etc beyond the recommendations of the original doc? For example the ATR of cable is around 150, euro slightly less. Loony is around 125, Aussie 75, europound less etc. Won't some of the params like the exclusion filter (50) need readjusting for instance? And then you have to do some backtesting of course. Just a thought chaps.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Many of the dollar charts show the fast ma recrossing or touching the slow one in the weekly direction, although many are also within the exclusion zone. Bringing other TA to the fore, I thought I'd have a stab with the new screening toys and paper trade these setups. If you actually followed these live then of course you must DYOR and assume any risks. Look below: http://img506.imageshack.us/img506/6...rusd5mu.th.gif http://img506.imageshack.us/img506/6...pusd9vl.th.gif http://img506.imageshack.us/img506/9...dchf5jv.th.gif

--- 帖子 #108 ---
.....simply go to tech's for open! Iso thanx for your work on this stuff. I'm assuming your red lines are 50 pip rule exclusion bands? I really like your MACDs I take them as "state of weekly momentum" of sorts. I elected not to apply your "red" one as it is a close emulation of the 55/8 cross and I need the space to write crap. You may notice that tunmacd &amp;tunmacd_dif share the same window on my chart. How might I "narrow" the "dif" line so that it doesn't oclude the macd activity behind it? See chart below. In a way, I would have liked a "slam dunk" entry based on the flip of the little yellow thingy. But..... I'm learning a lot about this system in the process. I believe it can be very profitable....This is a great system to exersise my patience. HJ

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Your welcome HJ! Yes the red lines are the 50 exclusion bands. The MACD shows the current week on the right so you get an up-to-date bar as the last bar. I was thinking of adding an option so that you could toggle between current bar and last weeks bar. Anybody want it? I dumped the 4h MACD like you said it wasn't really adding that much. Hey if the stuff you write is crap on the charts then I've been abusing my charts for a long time now! I tried the two indicators in one windows idea to save screen estate but the scaling becomes a problem. The windows expands to the scale of the bigger drawing I think. You could rescale the diff or grad window accordingly but it can be a bit messy. A better option might be just to hide an indicator when not required - just drag the separator window handle when not in use - saves you messing around with the code (although thats usually the way I do things!) I like the mechanical filtering of the system, especially on the 4hr. Once I've practised a bit more and adapted it then I should be able to use it more effectively. BTW I've reworked some of the code, and the template. So pick up the new goodies below.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hey 777, I was looking at this too! I did not take the trade shown on your chart but the current price on your chart was at a support level of the previous rally after a retracement of a break of that support. If we would have considered that as tech support. and entered with a large enough risk/stop. we would definately be in the money about 45 pips right now and dancing on the skirt of the "50 pip rule" See crummy chart below! HJ

Here is my attempt at a Daily Chart Version of the 4hr tunnel I tweaked the template for this as follows: 55sma/6(4hr periods)= 9.166----Rounded to 9sma (slightly Faster) 8sma/6(4hr periods)= 1.333----Rounded to 2sma (considerably Slower) if you compare the second daily chart with Iso's 4Hr stuff you may see a close aproximation of the sma status impose on the Daily chart while scrubbing for Daily PA. Any thoughts? How can I get a more accurate sma cross on this chart. Ouch...I'm trying to think again.....That Hurts! HJ

--- 帖子 #116 ---
If you pick up the indicators from post #113 the sma line &amp; exclusion lines should flip between timeframes. That was one of my changes for later on - hard code for 4h! Nice attempt at daily but then why not rework the fast &amp; slow ma's for this timeframe as well? ie 8 &amp; 55 or work them down and play around a bit..? That was my next step with this system...what other parameters might also work on different timeframes and how far away from the original set can you go..? After all the general premise for the weekly is to screen for medium term momentum and I've forgotten now how they were picked for the 4h. Also the profit targets using fibs, ma's - how can they be tweaked? Well thats me folks...more questions than answers! :

Hey guys; This thread is quite timely because I just came across Vegas' Tunnel method last week. I've spent this weekend reading his docs and I'm really interested in implementing his 4hr tunnel. I'd like to thank everyone here for discussing the 4hr tunnel and not getting off topic (like they have done in another forum already discussed in this thread). This week I plan on using the 4hr method on a demo basis. I'll be watching this thread for any more "golden nuggets" of information. BTW. Earlier in this thread there was a lot of mention of a PF. Can someone please tell me what PF is? thanks.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi volan, and welcome to Forex Factory, THE best Forex forum on the web! PF stands for Private Forum. It is a paid subscription service that is scheduled to begin on Jan 1st. It is headed up by James16, an amazingly successful trader with 20 years of trading experience. The PF came about because of James16 generous contributions on the thread on this forum called James16 Chart Thread. The readers of that thread were (and are) so excited about the profitable trading info that James16 shared there that they asked for more indepth training. In response, James16 has put together a team of traders who will be teaching in the PF when it opens. The subscription is $99 per month, cancellable at any time. The information available in the PF would cost you thousands elsewhere. And much of the information that will be available is simply not available anywhere else. In addition to reading posts by James16, you may also wish to read posts by the other PF instructors, Fijitrader, ElectricSavant and Diallist (that's me ). You'll be interested to know that my part of the PF will focus on a version of the 4hour tunnel method developed from the model by a group of traders known as Team Aphid, which I've bent to my liking and have been trading live with great success. Hope this answered your question, and again, welcome to the Factory! Dial

--- 帖子 #124 ---
And what entry were you planning to make in your bonehead journal? Are you implying that you somehow made a mistake? The large market move that stopped out V4 trades today (mine included) is exactly why it is so important to always set a stop (as you obviously did, nothing boneheaded about that at all!), and to properly limit one's risk with conservative position sizing and minimization of leverage. I'm not pinging on you Heavy, ol' buddy , I'm just using your post to make a point to newbies who may be reading this thread who have stars in their eyes over the backtest results of the V4 model and who also still believe they are somehow immune from the dangers of high leverage. I'd be willing to bet a couple of pips that there are readers of this thread who are in pain right now because they entered the recent V4 trades with far, far to large a position size. It is a good thing that the market occasionally punches us in the nose, to remind us to keep our guard up at all times. You know the saying, "Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...." Dial

--- 帖子 #125 ---
My bro' Dial has a good point. I actually do not think I'm a Bonehead.....some might.....but my mother likes me! The bonehead trader is the name of my journal thread....thats all. Maybe I can change the name to "Recovering Bonehead Trader" Tell you what. I'll start a new Tunnel Chart thread idf someone doesn't beat me to it! I know that Charles speaks the truth about the possibillity of pain from these positions lost this morning. please know that I never meant to rub in salt. Dial has warned us how difficult entry can be under these very conditions. i view this as valuable training if not "profitable" Actually while i lost out this time. I'm not convinced I made a bad entry. When I disect my trades I hope traders on this sight will offer insight and rebuke if necessary. I not only want to cover my trades (entry/exit strategy) in the journal but my approach to position size, risk, MM ect. any one else who wants to post is of course welcome. I may be lost in the Tunnel.....but I am searching for the light at the end Good Journey! HJ

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Same story here too. However I did book 10 pips but I came in too late to move the other half to BE so I took the slide along with the rest. The big move came ater housing report at 1500 gmt which normally isnt big news. But sometimes even a small report can be used by the strong hands to push the market around. I might take the tunnel to the daily timeframe and experiment there - might do better than 4h. But I will still check with you guys on the 4h and see how you're doing.

--- 帖子 #127 ---

Congrats on the 10 pips Iso! I came out a winner too in spite of the major reversal. I had already TP'd at 144 on GBP with 29 pips, and got stopped out on EUR with a profit of 83 pips. (I know, I know! I cheated and broke the 50 pip rule to enter, but only because I liked the technicals well enough to do so). What makes me mad is I almost reversed the EUR and GBP last night, but I told myself "No, the 8 SMA hasn't changed slope yet, and besides, it would be against the weekly trend", so I was a good boy and obeyed the system rules. But, for the benefit of you newbies reading this thread, if I had broken the rules and reversed my trades and made a pile of money on todays big move, it would have been a bad thing. Why? Because being rewarded for breaking the rules of your system only reinforces your inclination to break them again in the future. This will only get you burned in the long run. Better to keep to the rules and have an occasional disappointment, than break the rules and suffer major disaster! Dial

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Quite right Dial. Yes it is worst when you break rule and it will make money in first and several trades. But in long-run one is undermined. great wisdom P.S. I was deadly stopped at 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I hafta agree with Dial you sound like a smart guy and a fast learner. Your posts and humour are some of the best on the forum. I dunno why you do yourself down with the "bonehead" comments though? Still maybe we all need to take a leaf out of your book to keep ourselves humble and modest. I think Mr Market kicks my ass when my ego heads for the clouds!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Man if only I had your monthly pip scores then I would be really happy! I quite agree that breaking your system in the middle of a trade, although tempting at the time and sometimes successful, is sheer madness in the long run. If things don't work out then you kick yourself for not following your system. I find that if you get caught in that mindset and sometimes you will pick up flaws or potential improvements like this then jot them down and research them seperately and then perhaps redevelop and retest your system if required.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
OK, so I've been studying the 4hr tunnel method and I have some questions. If one of you good people would be so kind as to answer I would appreciate it. 1) The Vegas document states that as the difference between the 21EMA and 5SMA increases on the weekly chart then momentum is increasing, then as the difference decreases you've reached your medium-term top and price will start to drop. If the difference between 21 and 55 is getting smaller, does this signal a change in direction? If so should we be looking to make trades in that direction instead of the previous direction? To clarify, let's say the 21 and 55 MAs are going up and separating, then they start to come together, but they're still pointing up; what do we do? Are we still looking for long positions or are we looking for short positions? 2) For entry timing, let's say that the 21 and 5 on the weekly charts are going up and separating so we're looking for long positions. Then we go to the 4h chart and look at he 8 SMA. We wait for it to drop a little (preferably through the 55, but not necessary) and then for it to "hook" back up. Then we enter long. Do we enter as soon as it hooks up or do we have to wait unti the bar closes to confirm (or even wait and see what the next bar is doing)? 3) The 1st filter is on the weekly charts. It says that if the difference between 21 and 5 MAs are greater than 500 pips, "then the pip difference from the prior week must change by more than 10 pips, or just go lower over 2 consecutive weeks. tp sogma; a trend change". What does the stuff in quotes mean? 4) The 2nd filter is on the 4hr chart. It says that if price and the 2 MAs are within 50 pips then go to technicals. Is this the 50 pips "exclusion zone" I've read about in this thread? 5) Iso was kind enough to post some indicators, but I'm not sure what they're for. Would Iso or someone else be kind enough to explain them? 5.1) The 1st indicator "tun_lines" puts a red line on my chart. What is it? 5.2) The 2nd indicator "tun_macd" puts a grey macd histogram on my chart. I thought that MACD was supposed to show convergance/divergance of 2 MAs but they don't seem to follow the convergance/divergance of the 5/21MAs tha I have plotted. Can someone please explain? 5.3) The 3rd indicator is also a MACD histogram. This one is yellow. I don't know what it is. 5.4) The 4th indicator "tun_sma_line" puts a white line on my chart. What is this? 6) At the following website http://www.freewebs.com/mswilson/ there are indicators by someone called "spiggy" It looks like 2 of the indicators are to be used on weekly charts and 2 on 4hr charts. Has anyone used these indicators and can you please tell me what they are? I really appreciate any help that any of you can give me with respect to my above questions. Thank you very much.

First, please keep in mind that the Vegas document outlines a trading model, not a trading system. Therefore, the answers I will give are based on the system I trade that is derived from the Vegas model. This is not explicitly stated in the Vegas documents. However a careful reading of the document and the back test tables reveals clues that it is indeed the case that the trend has reversed as soon as the momentum decreases from one week to the next. I had compiled a list of those clues and emailed them to a friend, but we have both lost our copies, so I can't provide them now, nor do I feel like going back through the document again. But yes, as soon as the momentum decreases, the trend is considered to have changed. But, it is very important to understand that the system is most vulnerable to losses during trend changes. This is because momentum, as defined here, is a lagging indicator. Price action should be your first clue that a trend change signal is about to occur. In other words, price action will say the trend is now up, while the vegas momentum indication will still say down. It is for these reasons that I personally use discretion during trend changes to see the true trade direction. In between trend changes however the momentum indicator is right on 90% of the time. And that is really all we need it for, not for an exact delineation of the trend, but simply to put the odds in our favor. For this purpose, it works very well. I would also suggest you look a few posts back in this thread at the discussion between myself and Isotonic regarding the times when an increase in momentum can indicate a trend change. This is not mentioned in the Vegas document at all. It is something I observed while actually trading the system. This is another shortcoming of the Vegas document. They simply say to enter the trade when the slope changes. But that begs the very question you are asking, "how much?". Please refer to my post number 26 of this thread where I explain the concept of the neutral line and two ways to enter a trade after the neutral line is crossed. First, by entering on the close as you mentioned, or second, by setting a trailing entry a fixed number of pips from the neutral line. Okay, before answering your question, and to avoid confusion because of some statements I've made in other posts, I want to mention that I compute momentum using the current week (as yet unclosed), and the week prior to the current week. Vegas does it differently. They use the first and second closed weeks counting back from the current week. Therefore, in the Vegas model, the trend signal will only change after close on Friday. The way I do it, the trend signal can occur mid-week. That said, to answer your question: If the momentum is less than 500 pips, then any amount of decrease from one week to the next will mark a trend change. But, according to Vegas, if the momentum is greater than 500 pips, then the criteria to consider the trend to have changed is different and can be either of these two scenarios: (1) The momentum decreases by more than 10 pips between the first and second most recently closed bars. or (2) The momentum decreases by any amount for BOTH the first and second AND second and third most recently closed bars. Personally, I have yet to encounter a momentum of greater than 500 pips so at this point I have doubts about the validity or need for this rule. So for me, the jury is still out on this rule. When in doubt, look to price action. Yes. Please refer to my post number 13 of this thread. Please read first the comments at the top of the post made by Team Aphid as to why price is ignored and then look at the image at the bottom of that post that shows how the upper and lower bounderies are derived from the SMA's only and not price. Iso, I defer to your wisdom on this question. I played with the spiggy breifly but didn't like it. As I recall, it shows a trend indication on the four hour chart, but it is derived from the weekly chart which also has to be open as I recall. The spiggy trend indicator only changes at the close of the week. This did not serve my needs as I look for intraweek trend changes. The remaining indicators were of no value to me, but may be to others (at least they are to spiggy : ) Hope this helps a little. Dial

Thank you very much. I will indeed re-read this entire thread paying special attention to the posts you mentioned.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
OK here goes: 5.1) The 1st indicator "tun_lines" puts a red line on my chart. What is it? These serve to highlight the "exclusion zones" for price if the 50 pip rule is invoked. When the rules is not valid the lines should disappear. You should get a pair of lines when the rules is invoked. This implements post #13 from Dial. 5.2) The 2nd indicator "tun_macd" puts a grey macd histogram on my chart. I thought that MACD was supposed to show convergance/divergance of 2 MAs but they don't seem to follow the convergance/divergance of the 5/21MAs tha I have plotted. Can someone please explain? The default settings plot the weekly MACD for the 5 &amp; 21 MA. Most of the illustrations here overlay the weekly on the 4h chart which might explain the confusion. Check back with the weekly again and see if they work. The indicator was adapted from existing MT4 code so should be correct. 5.3) The 3rd indicator is also a MACD histogram. This one is yellow. I don't know what it is. This measures the weekly change between MACD bars in 5.2 and plots them also as as histogram. 5.4) The 4th indicator "tun_sma_line" puts a white line on my chart. What is this? This puts in the close of the bar 8 bars back from the current bar (bar 0) on the 4h chart and extends it right to the current bar - the neutral line. It just implements post #26 by Dial to help you judge when the 8sma crosses the neutral line to help filter price action. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Just a quick note: I'd like to point out finally that none of the code is exhaustively tested so there may be some bugs left. However none of the code is that complex either so I'm confident they are mostly correct. As per usual report back any bugs for me to check...

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I also played with the spiggy stuff and some of seemed to be redundant. Like plotting the MA's on the weekly - why not use MT indicators instead? Also the backtesting although useful for future reference showed a loss when I ran it on a number of pairs which serves to illustrate how most purely mechanical systems fail miserably unless you do 2 things: 1. use your common sense with the signals they generate and make your own decisions on top - mechanical discretion or 2. build purely mechanical systems like Merlin does and then you might stand a chance of success. This takes time to learn and expertise to implement but it can be done to great effect as Merlin can testify. (Plus I didn't like the colour schemes spiggy chose. )

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks Iso, I really appreciate you're explanation. Further to my comment about spiggy's indicators, In case anyone is interested, here is another link to his indicators (at least I think they're his) http://www.lightpatch.com/forex/mt_y...-V2/Readme.txt In there is a readme.txt file that explains his indicators. The text of the readme follows. Thanks again to everyone for discussing the 4hr tunnel. Description =========== This implementation of the new 4 Vegas system for MT4 is organised as follows: 4hVegasMetaTraderWeeklyChart.mq4 (Optional) ------------------------------------------- Places the Moving average lines on the Weekly chart. It does not produce any calculations, only visualises the MA lines for information purposes.The green line in the main window is the EMA21 and the blue line is the SMA5. 4hVegasMetaTraderWeeklyIndicator.mq4 (Mandatory) ------------------------------------------------ Calculates the trend according to the divergence of the SMA5 and EMA21. Publishes a weekly variable of the trend to be used in the 4h chart. The variable is calculated from Sunday to Sunday.The blue line in the child window is the difference between the SMA5 and the EMA21. The Green and Red histogram bars are the *change* since the last measurement. If the bar is green, the week is a bull week, if the bar is red, the week is a bear week. 4hVegasMetaTrader4hCTD.mq4 (Optional) ----------------------------------- Shows the state of the weekly trend variable in the child window on the 4hour chart. For information only. 4hVegasMetaTrader4hChart.mq4 (Mandatory) -------------------------------- Uses the weekly variable to confirm the direction of the trade, and then enters or exits based on the MA crossovers.On the ENTRY the brackets show the entry price, on EXIT, the brackets hold the P/L Using it ======== 1) Open a weekly chart. Place the "4hVegasMetaTraderWeeklyIndicator.mq4" (and optionally "4hVegasMetaTraderWeeklyChart.mq4") on it 2) Open a 4H chart for the same symbol. Place "4hVegasMetaTrader4hChart.mq4" (and optionally "4hVegasMetaTrader4hCTD.mq4") on it. 3) Use the "PrintTags" option to print trade information - beware there is lots and without a good monitor you will not see much!Thanks and credit to go to the Vegas team.

I've had a quick look at the link and I think it refers to v2 and not 3 (quite what the differences are I'm not sure). Anway from the text file given below I've checked against the code and it looks like the optional stuff is junk, The weekly indicator is the same as the macd_grad I've done. They jury is still out on the 4h mandatory strategy tester (at least thats what I think it is). Still I might keep that for the future. Anyway I like the colour swapping on his weekly gradient so decided to do the same for my indicators. (Nothing like "borrowing" an idea, is there!? ) Heres a quick screenshot: I've painted the gradient a lighter shade of the momentum colours (just to be a tart! : ) http://img456.imageshack.us/img456/3...dcad6nl.th.gif Don't forget to pick up the new toys in the attachment.

Took me a while to figure this one out (I'm not that smart), but I think I've got it. The yellow histogram actually shows "rate of change", so even though momentum may be building i.e. the 2 MAs are getting farther apart (like it is on US/JPY) the rate of change can be slowing down, which may indicate an upcoming loss of momentum, and perhaps a trend change. That's awesome!!! Thanks again for the indicators. Now that I know how to use them I'm finding them very useful.

Dialist, I know there's more to it than this, but is the basic idea to: 1) See if the weekly momentum changes, regardless of the MA cross direction 2) If momentum changes, only look for trades in this new direction on 4 hour charts until there's another weekly momentum change? Thanks, John

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Now I've coloured in the indicators I can do a nice little study and try to figure some stuff out with a time series example. I've picked the loony and will highlight one year (2003) which marked the slide in this pair and see how certain entry points can be picked off. There is no exit points highlighted - only by inference of trend line breaks. So here is a 9 year chart with a cut off point from Dec 2002: http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/7...cad10oi.th.gif Note how after that time the red momentum dominates with small bluish momentum peaks. So you should be able to see that the red areas correspond to the bear run in a big way and the bulls didn't have enough strength to mount any serious rallies. See my earlier posts for an explanation of the notations and discussion with Dial about this stuff.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I've marked points where the momentum turns drops off using red vertical lines and there have been 8 decent turns on the chart. http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/8...cad22nz.th.gif You should be able to see them on the MACD Gradient indicator as the point where it drops below the centre line (bottom chart in red). This should also mark momentum dropping off on the MACD indicator above (either above or below the centre line). Both charts in tandem are easier to work these things out I think - more so if you do this by hand. Think of MACD momentum as the speed your travelling at and the gradient as the acceleration. So if the momentum increases week on week then you're accelerating - this can be either +ve or -ve momentum (since the sign is just a direction) and conversely if it decreases then you're decelerating. If two consecutive weeks are at the same level then there is no acceleration from one week to the next. Both types of acceleration are variable as you can see on the gradient chart. However if the grad is above the centre line you have +ve acceleration and if below then -ve acceleration. The first five lines mark signficant sell offs compared to the last three - can you see why?

No! Could you clue me or dja want me to work at it some more. I do sooooo love the new multicolored toys. Don't give up on me! Balancing my time between studying and developing the Bonehead stategy! and of course.......fixin' the toilets! Thanx for all this work....again! HJ

--- 帖子 #146 ---
You got it! That is the basic idea.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thanks, Dialist. That concept of weekly momentum changes gives me a different perspective on this. John

--- 帖子 #148 ---
well heres the answer to the teaser i set yesterday: (the 2 years should read 3 on the chart) http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/2...cad24lh.th.gif

--- 帖子 #149 ---
price hidden at the top...just to focus on indicators notice just before the last red line when macd is red and the grad just turns briefly blue and then sinks back into the red. this would normally signal a weekly trend change but you can see with both indicators how it would look like a false signal. http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/5...cad33ym.th.gif

--- 帖子 #150 ---
With the -ve gradient turns brought in from the weekly. You can see how just soon after all lines the price takes a dive. More so after the 2 &amp; 3rd lines. Targets set by my line drawing rather than fib lines or ma turns. This I might keep for my adaptation. The MA is the slow 55sma 4hr brought onto the daily so is 55/6=9 (and a bit). I miscalculated so its actually 8 on my charts ( just don't tell anyone. ) The 8/6=1 and a bit for the fast ma seemed to be pointless so I left it out. http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/5...cad43ea.th.gif

--- 帖子 #151 ---
An interesting point to test is the weekly momentum &amp; grad changes shown on these charts on other pairs. How valid is it? http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/6...cad53lh.th.gif http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9...cad64vp.th.gif http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9...cad76ze.th.gif http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/5...cad87tj.th.gif

I'm glad you liked the new toys - I actually took the blue &amp; red colours from your charts! I think I've found a way of adapting this system for my purposes...but Charles "knife" could blow all this away next month so I'm being cautious right now.

Please don't hold back. I'd like to hear of any changes you've made. Thanks Dial

--- 帖子 #155 ---
hey guys; I'd like to get your take on the 50pip "exclusion" region. Of course it's not really an exclusion region according to Vegas, he simply says that if you want to take the trade that you should look at technicals. Anyway, I'd like to put this to people on this tread. It seems that Iso's take on the 50pip thing (and please correct me if I've mis-interpreted) it to take the uppoer point (55MA, 8MA, or price) and draw a line 50 pips above that, and then do the same thing with the lower point. That can sometimes give an exclusion region of something very large. For example, right now on EUR/GBP You see that there are about 160 pips betwen the 2 red lines http://i22.imagethrust.com/t/113047/eurgbp.jpg My reading of Vegas' document is that you go to technicals if the 2 MAs (8 SMA and 55 SMA) and price are all within 50pips. So, take the top point (say price) and the bottom point (say 55MA) and if there's 50 pips between them, go to technicals. Is my read incorrect? Is there really a 50pip buffer above the upper point and below the lower point? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I haven't read all of Iso's posts yet so I can't comment on his view of the 50 pip rule. I would suggest you re-read post 13 of this thread. For myself, if the 50 pip rule is in effect, as defined in post 13, then I look at current price action to decide whether to enter a trade or not. I enter on technicals about half the time, and wait for the boundaries to be exceeded before starting to look for slope changes again the other half of the time. I haven't investigated taking "breakout" trades on piercing the boundaries yet. Oh yes, the GBP/USD has not been under the 50 pip rule since Nov 30 at 10:00 pm EST. That means you should be looking for slope changes to signal a trade today. I don't know where the term "exclusion" region came from. I don't see that anything is excluded. The 50 pip rule does not prevent you from taking a trade, it only changes how you take the trade (technicals vs slope change). To add more confusion to the fire, I am currently doing a manual backtest of the knife system and based on what I've seen so far, I am considering either ditching the 50 pip rule altogether, or perhaps rewriting it. BTW, I highly recommend to all who are interested in this model/system to perform your own MANUAL backtest. Going through the charts bar by bar has been very enlightening and has given me a much better feel for the flow of the system. Dial

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I agree with the 50 pip explanation in post 13. I think that Iso may be implementing it a little differently. I think he is subtracting 50 from the low indicator and adding 50 the the high indicator (Iso, is that correct?). As for the word "exclusion" please disregard. I may have read it in a post somewhere and it stuck in my head. I know it's not an exclusion zone, simply an indication that you should look at technicals.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I just made up the "exclusion" term as another way of saying "50 pip rule" so don't worry about the term too much. The way I've implemented it in mt4 should agree with what Dial said in post #13. I've checked it a few times and it should be correct. I agree with low volatility pairs like EURGBP the number itself may need adjusting. I'm also thinking of ditching the rule altogether as well.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I suppose its really for Jim so here goes... Will Jim's daily tunnel system also be taught in the pf? Along with the knife, or separately or not at all? Just wondering, that's all!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Iso, I think you may be implementing the 50 pip rule in an opposite manner to which post #13 prescribes. The following figure shows my understanding of post #13. The lines that say 50pips are just approximate because I eyeballed them. http://i28.imagethrust.com/t/113534/eurgbp.jpg The two horizontal red lines were generated using Iso's "tun_lines" indicator. The turquoise horizontal lines show (about) 50 pips above the turquoise 8 SMA. The grey horizontal lines show (about) 50 pips below the grey 55 SMA. Even though the two regions overlap a little, it can plainly be seen that the 8 SMA is more than 50pips away from the 55 SMA. But the "tun_lines" indicator shows that all indicators (including price) are within its bounds. Dial, is my understanding in line with your post#13? Iso, is my understanding the same as yours?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Yes, your turquoise lines conform to post 13. I think you are right that Iso is measuring from the wrong ma's. It does not matter which ma is higher or which is lower. The 8 can be above the 55 or below it. It only matters that when the two ma's are within 50 pips of each other, the upper boundary line will be 50 pips above the LOWER ma, and the lower boundary line will be 50 pips below the UPPER ma. Think of it this way. If the 8 and 55 are exactly 50 pips apart, and the 55 is uppermost, then the upper boundary will be on the 55 and the lower boundary will be on the 8. As the 8 and 55 move closer together, the boundary lines will move further apart until both ma's are at the same level (crossing). At that point the two boundary lines will be at their maximum distance of 100 pips apart. Iso's reasons may be different from mine, but I'm considering ditching, or at least modifying the 50 pip rule. In my backtesting, I have seen slope changes that would have been ignored because the 50 pip rule was in effect that ended up garnering well over 200 pips. I have also seen instances when the 50 pip rule was not in effect, but the 8 sma and price were in bed with each other for an extended period. Now nothing works all the time, so the best we can do is come up with rules that work most of the time in order to stack the probabilities in our favor. Even though I am considering ditching the 50 pip rule, I would not do so just because of the occasional occurence of the two scenarios just outlined. Ignoring the current 50 pip rule just to capture the above two scenarios might also let it a lot of losing trades. It may be that the current rule, warts and all, may be the best current solution. I just suspect that it can be improved. And that will require additional testing. As always, rely on your intra-aural computer for case by case discretion. Dial

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yes good spot volan. I messed up the code when I was changing it last time around (can't even remember why I changed it now). It should be OK for this pair. I did a quick check on the swissy too and it looked fine. Pick up the revised indicator in the attachment. Thanks for reporting the bugs.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I think I might be jumping the gun by ditching this rule since I haven't really explored this system to the degree that you have. So it might be foolish on my part to remove it only to add it back later on if I change my mind. From your explanation below it looks like I would need to consider the implications a bit more first!

Here are the last batch of charts from the study. They roughly correspond to the daily charts previously.

FWIW, I just emailed the following question to the Vegas Team. I think Diallist is right on this, but I thought it would be interesting to see their response: Vegas Team, Hello, and thanks for the good free info you've put online about your two Tunnel systems. I have a question about the 4 Hour Tunnel. I'll just use the USDCHF pair to hopefully make it simple. For the weekly chart, the 5 MA has been above the 21 MA since around April. However, there have been numerous weeks when the 5 MA loses relative momentum to the 21. When this happens, do you look to short the USDCHF (on 4 HR charts) until relative momentum switches directions again? In other words, when deciding to go long or short, is the weekly relative momentum change the key factor? Or is it the 5/21 crossover direction (in which case, you'd only be taking longs since April)? Thanks! John

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I had the same question.. they refered to it as a 'medium term bottom' when it looses momentum.. but they never mentioned what to do. Do we stay on the side lines? Do we short when the 8 SMA terms negative? Did you get a responce from them?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
No, I haven't heard from them. And even after I re-read the document, the answer to your question still isn't clear. Maybe they left it intentionally vague so people can simply grasp the general idea then customize it like Diallist and others are doing...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Yea I read it once, read it again, programmed it, and read it one more time and when I went live with is thats when the question clicked. My natural guess would be to sit on the sidelines, no? I mean, Medium term bottom and also be a begining for consolidation, reversal, or even continuation of trend. And without the 1 week lag to provide future referance you wouldn't know which side to pick so that is what I am doing right now. Are you implementing this method on the majors like them or all? I sort of customized it for all.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
For me to have full confidence in the weekly trend indication, I like to see three things in agreement: (1) The momentum has increased from the previous week. (2) The current weekly bar is bullish if (1) is up or bearish if (1) is down. (3) The 55 SMA on the 4 hour chart has a positive slope if (1) is up or a negative slope if (1) is down. To tell the truth, I like trading with the slope of the 55 SMA as my trend indicator, but I haven't been doing that long enough to know if is reliable enough to use by itself. So, for now, I'm just using it to confirm what the momentum is telling me. When in doubt, stay out. Dial

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hmm here is another question I have in regards to how they wrote it. It says (and I programmed it a little differently but will reprogram soon) that you only buy (that is if it has bullish momentum on the weekly) when the 8 SMA is turning POSITIVE while being BELOW the 55 SMA, and to SELL when it begins turning NEGATIVE. In this case I looked back in history and we would have many buy signals with sell signals, all gains, however, not to the maximum without a re-entry procedure, since it would turn positive again while being above the 55 SMA. Anyone have any comments to this?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I'm sorry xspowerx, I just don't understand your question. I got confused with your pairing of buys &amp; sells. Please ask your question again but with more detail please and I'll try to help you. Thanks Dial

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks diallist. In the method written by VEGAS, he states the when the weekly has bullish momentum, the 4hr buy signal would be when the 8 SMA &lt; 55 SMA and when the 8 SMA is turning positive. The sell signal for profits would be when the 8 SMA begins to turn negative again. Diallist, my question is, there are many tiems the 8 SMA turns negative yet there is more potential in the currency. How do we know when to re-enter? Or do we not and wait for it to get below the 55 SMA again? Or maybe turn positive again? If we wait for it to turn positive again, that would be in contradiction to what VEGAS wrote, since it wouldnt be less than 55 SMA. Here is what I am refering to: We now are looking for the 8 SMA to move lower through the 55 SMA. When it does, we carefully watch and notice when the SLOPE of the 8 SMA changes from negative to positive . It will do this when the 8 SMA stops losing value in one 4 hour bar and gains in the next. This is the 4 hour bar to initiate new long positions with 3 units [remember: units are whatever trading size you can handle. When you trade bigger, just adjust the size of the unit, not the number of units]. Stops can be placed using technicals [support/res/trendline] of the most recent 4 hour bars. Assuming the market starts to go up, we stay long until 1) at some point in time the 8 SMA changes slope from positive to negative, at which point we exit the entire 3 unit trade, 2) the market moves up, there is no slope change, and goes to the 144 or 233 fib number from the 55 SMA line, where 1 unit is taken off, 3) the market moves up to the next fib number [233 or 377], again with no slope change, and the 2nd unit is booked. If we follow his strict method, the USDJPY should be a buy in the next couple of days. The 8 SMA should be turning positive...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
The 8 SMA turning negative again in this case means the entire trade has turned against you. You may get a profit, but you can also get a loss if it is early in the trade. I have had some trades where I entered when the 8 SMA turned positive and then turned negative again during the same bar for a loss. Ideally, during a picture perfect trade, where you have entered three positions, you will take profit at the first fib level with one of your positions; you will take profit again at the second fib level with another of your positions; and finally the third position will be closed when the 8 SMA reverses. There are actually two signals given by the system. I call them Primary and Secondary. (I was going to call them Fred and Ethel, but I couldn't keep them straight as to which was which). Assuming the weekly trend is UP, you will enter a long trade EVERY TIME the 8 SMA turns positive. If the 8 SMA turns positive while it is below the 55 SMA then that constitutes a Primary trade signal and you would enter the trade with your full position size as determined by your money management methodology. If the 8 SMA turns positive while it is above the 55 SMA then that constitutes a Secondary trade signal and you would enter the trade with only half your position size. This is because secondary trade signals are not as reliable as primary trade signals. You would do exactly the opposite if the weekly trend is DOWN. During a strong trend, it is not unusual to get several secondary trade signals in a row. I think this is what you were refering to. Be very careful here. Yes, the weekly momentum is still saying UP on the USD/JPY. BUT, take a look at the price action on the weekly chart. We might be about to have a trend change on the USD/JPY from UP to DOWN. As Vegas so correctly pointed out: it is during trend changes that the system is most vulnerable to losses. This is where the use of discretion comes in handy. But, until you have traded this system long enough to get good at applying discretion, I would suggest that you stay out of the market if you are uncertain as to the true trend direction. Does this answer your question? If not, let me know and I'll give it another go. Dial

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Diallist, that exactly answers my question. Your explanation of primary and secondary trades helped define what he ment. Thank you. I can see how the trend changing period can be more vulnerable to losses, example the USDJPY like you mentioned. I have just looked and I realize that I may have a small technique to add to this model. When the weekly bar breaks below the 5 SMA by more than 50 pips we may see a possible trend change and best to stay out until that bar reaches in within the 50 pips of the 5 SMA. Let me know what you think about that. I like to look at bars as they close, I guess its a habit I have which is not good for the longer term charts. For example, this, its almost obviouse it will close down which will show a medium term bottom for the USD/JPY, if not all the JPY's. So I guess this is something I have to get used to. How do you play medium term bottoms? Do you just stay out?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hmmm I got a great idea. Why dont we post trades on here in relevance with this system. As of right now I see nothing. And I dont know how to play medium term bottoms so i am just staying out.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
What do you mean by "medium term bottom"? I didn't understand Vegas' use of the term in their document and I still don't. What do you think it means?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thats the thing, I dont know how to define it either. A bottom as in reversal? Bottom as in consolidation? I am not sure.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Okay, I just took another look at the Vegas document. Vegas states that the weekly chart with the 21 and 5 MA's is used to determine a medium term trend. When the trend changes, as indicated by a change in momentum, it is said to be a medium term top if going from an up trend to a down trend, and a medium term bottom if going from a down trend to an up trend. To answer your question as to how I handle these tops and bottoms (trend changes), I use discretion by always being aware of the price action going on in the the weekly chart. I don't depend on the momentum indicator to tell me what direction the trend is because it is a lagging indication. Price leads any momentum change and will give early warning that the momentum is about to change as well. For example, yesterday the momentum on the USD/JPY said the trend was up. But in my view, the price action on this pair on the weekly and 4 hour charts told me that the trend had already changed to down. Therefore, yesterday, I took a short position in the USD/JPY and was able to reap the pips caused by the Trade Deficit report. (the pair dropped like a rock, as you know). If I had traded strictly on the momentum as a trend indicator, I would have had a loss. As you can see, the momentum trend indication changed from up to down last night, long after the price action told me to go short. I use the momentum indicator as confirmation of price action. Not the other way round. Price is King. All other indicators and oscillators are derived from price. That is why I think it is so important to be aware of price action on both the weekly and 4 hour charts to tell me what the true state of the trend is. Further, if the momentum is indicating an up trend, but the current weekly bar and the slope of the 55 MA are showing down, I will trade down, not up. Also, if the state of the trend is in transition, the 55 MA will usually be relatively horizontal. I will either stay out of the market, or will trade both directions, depending on my view of the price action on the 4 hour chart. And, while doing all this, I remain mindful of, but not a slave to, the 50 pip rule. I believe discretion is required to garner the greatest profit from this system. But discretion is an art that can only be acquired with practice with and familiarity of a given system along with the personality of a particular currency pair. This is the main reason why in the PF, I am/will be emphasizing that traders new to this system, and especially newbies, trade this system on demo until they have mastered it. Dial

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Ahh I see I see. So when the prive falls below the last weeks x, which is x = 5 SMA - 21 SMA it may be a turn and best to short at that point... To play the top.. Opposite for bottoms. Thanks for sharing your thought. They are much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thank you all for your hard work on this thread, especially Dial. A few weeks ago I sent an e-mail to Vegas; I just received a reply today which should be helpful for us all. Below is a copy of the e-mail exchange: Hello Vegas, I am interested in using a 4 hour strategy to trade the forex so I was very excited to read about your method. Can you please give me an update about how this method has performed for you? and have you made any changes since you wrote this document? -Claude in Calgary, Alberta Claude, Sorry for the delay. Our performance results are quite good, but they are useless to you. It doesn't make any difference how much I make if you lose money. Discipline is the key. The only changes we have made is that we now use daily candles with 24 and 28 ema's respectively as a guide in trading. Create a daily chart, then overlay 24 and 28 ema's, then plot the 144, 233 and 377 fib numbers. Do this on a weekly chart as well, but plot the fib numbers 377, 610, and 987 [these are for gbp. Other currency pairs will be different]. Now, look at all 3 charts [the 1 hour or 4 hour depending on which tunnel method you use, the daily, and the weekly. You will immediately see the wonderful trading opportunities. -vegas

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Whoa whoa whoa, Claude thanks for sharing that with us. In referance to adding the daily, must it agree with the weekly along with a northern moving 8 EMA on the 4hr in order to confirm a buy? I dont use fib numbers. So those have no referance to me. How have you yourself been doing with this method?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thank you for sharing that kwalberta! And welcome to the factory, or thank you for delurking as the case may be. Always glad to have new members added to the FF family! I wonder if they meant the 24 &amp; 28 ema's to be on the close or the median? Thoughts anyone? Dial

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hmmm as in enter trades after close or during the open bar? If thats the case, my opinion would be close to avoid fakes. I am not sure since I dont now have my programs up right now (I'm at work) but using the daily would permit us to, I believe, find potential profits. For example USDJPY, the Daily is going negative, the weekly has gone negative, and the 8 SMA is heading down. That Spells short right there, rather then waiting til the end of the week to finally realize we have a reversal in place. In conclusion, it elminates lag by one week. Dial let me know what you think on my analysis.. if I am viewing this right.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
The information seems a bit vague, and thus open to speculation. Are they implying that you use the daily ma's in a similar manner to the weeklies so that would imply median rather than close? Also are they fine tuning weekly momentum using a daily chart? How are you meant to use this new timeframe? Was there any more information from Vegas in the email?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi, Time for me to ask what may be a dumb question. Where they say plot the 144, 233 and 377 fib numbers. Are they saying to plot more moving averages using the fib numbers for the period values or have I missed it completely. I'm certainly lost in the tunnel trying to understand what they mean Thanks

--- 帖子 #186 ---
LOL You missed it completly buddy, but is ok. They mean from the time you get a buy signal to plot those fib numbers in as a point to take of 1 unit off the trade.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I would like to have a meeting tonight in referance to this "PR" with other traders of the board. It can be with anyone who trades this. I wanna figure this out and reprogram my model. Any messanger is good for me.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
LOL! You missed it too! (relax, I'm just picking on you good naturedly) It has nothing to do with getting a signal. It has to do with plotting lines parallel to a central moving average at distances of 144, 233 &amp; 377 pips above AND below the central moving average. What they didn't tell us was WHICH moving average to measure from. Therefore I shall make a WAG (Wild Ass Guess) and choose the slower, 28 EMA. The image below is the daily chart of GBP/USD. The 24 EMA is blue and the 28 EMA is yellow. Above and below the 28 EMA are plotted the three fib levels (in silver) at which profit would be taken.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Why not post right here where everyone can participate and benefit from the brainstorming? And what does "PR" mean. Sorry, I don't know.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Whoa I did miss it completely. Thanks for correcting me LOL. Now I gotta learn how to program that.. maybe thats why I never used them cause I never really new it was that. Here people respond slower, in a chat I figured we can have a more timely discussion but here is good to. I am going to dinner now, will you be on tonight? PR is stock term for Press Release, sorry LOL

--- 帖子 #191 ---
On the chart below I deleted the 24 EMA and left the 28 EMA. I added an 8 SMA on the close. I entered on the close after the slope change with three units and exited one unit per fib level. If only 1 or 2 fib levels had been hit, I would have closed the trade on the close of the bar after the next slope change. Not bad for two trades, huh? Dial P.S. The secondary trade in the middle yielded 424 pips in one day, bringing the average pips per day to 66 over the 43 days. I think I like this!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
What is cool is you only have to check your trade once a day and adjust the limits to the new fib levels. Probably wouldn't hurt to trail a stop either. Hmmm....100 pips? Whadda ya think? The whole deal should only take 5 minutes a day! (make that six minutes) Dial

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hey Dial good work! Your posts here are always insightful. I'm gonna hammer this tunnel system to pieces over xmas and see what I can come up with before the launch of the pf. To be honest once the pf opens, I'm gonna head straight to your section and grab all your stuff.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Oh? Didn't Merlin tell you? Because you nearly gave me a heart attack by making me believe that BlueMonkey had quit the forum, your access to my section will be blocked until Groundhog day. Have a nice day. Dial

--- 帖子 #195 ---
FYI everyone. I think the concept in post 193 above has potential, maybe. I already see some problems that could kill the profitability. But, I've already got some ideas of how to minimize those problems. I'm going to try out a few other ideas I have; backtest them; and if they work out I'll present my findings as a new system in the Private Forum. Not sure what I'll call it yet. Perhaps "Arrow" or "Boomerang" or some such weird name as that. I've already experimented tonight with alternate MA's on different currencies and I might be on to something good. Dial

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi guys, do not you notice that 1hour system works well at the beginning of the momentum and 4 hour coming in action later?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
No, I hadn't noticed since I don't trade the 1 hour system. There's nothing wrong with it. It's a great system too, but it doesn't fit my schedule. But I can tell you this: Team Aphid discovered that the Bolt system (available in the Beginners Forum) is good for late entries if you happen to miss an entry on the Vegas 4 hour system. Please tell us more about your observation. Dial

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi diallist How do you construct "FIB" lines which are parallel to the 28 SMA at the pips required using Metatrader (FXStrategy) or Visual Trader? Trinity

--- 帖子 #199 ---
OK first of all execuse me if I misunderstood 1hour system I have not read that but I guess it is with the same set up as 4 hour. only difference is that you use daily momentum as trend identification signal and 1hour charts for entry, MAs are the same. Am I right? If no then I have new system which comes from 4hour system but is valid only on beginning of momentum. If yes then I will provide charts that confirms how 1hour is good at the beginning of the momentum. OK so my question is: Is 1hour momentum system as I described above? thanks

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I did not have time to program and test last night but I will later today or tonight and post the results. Keep in touch how you all are interpreting this.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Great Googly Moogly! :surprised I have been on a Bird Watching Safari (in lion country) for the last week and a half and just checked up on this thread. You guys have definitley, kicked it up a notch. BAMM! Thanks to all for the work here! QUESTION TO CLAUDE: ( BTW: welcome to FF ) I had sent vegas a similar email request and had no reply. Did you use the "Hotmail" address in the 4hr Doc? Anywho, I gotta go catch up with you guys. and thanx again to Charles for adding his experience to this discussion.. and Iso for the toys! HJ

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I don't know about FXStrategy or Visual Trader, but here's how you do it in the MetaTrader 4 Client Terminal: Insert a moving average like you normally would but before closing the "Moving Average" dialog box, click on the "Levels" tab and enter the fib values as shown in the image below. Dial

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Diallist are you happy with Metatrader? How much do you pay for it? I'm with tradestation.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Yes, very happy. It may not have all the features of Tradestation, but it serves my purposes very well, and there are tons and tons of programs for it available all over the net. The price is zero. You can download it free, including free data feed, from www.metaquotes.net Enjoy Dial

--- 帖子 #205 ---
No kidding, its free? I'm gonna check that out. Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Thanks a million. Yes I've found FXStrategy (Moneytec Metatrader 4) very good too. A pity it doesnt include Time Series Forecast, but it does have RVI. Best wishes for the Christmas Season to all. Trinity

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I just wanted to put in my $0.02 on this thread regarding the daily charts. In my mind there is a very large gap between the weekly and 4-hr charts. The shorter term momentum (4hr) can be going in one direction while the longer term (weekly) can be going another. I've been thinking of using the daily charts to indicate the direction of the medium-term momentum. I'd use the same strategy for determining momentum on the weekly charts, except use it on the daily's then trade on the 4-hr. I haven't tried this yet, but I'm going to try it over the next week. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Try daily momentum and 1hour for entry signal. currently this indicates to initiate longs in EURUSD and GBPUSD. let's look what will happen.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Thanks for the tip on the 1-hr charts, but I prefer to use 4-hr charts because it's difficult for me to keep checking charts at work and on the 4-hr I only need to check a couple of times a day.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hmmm Im programming this in right now and realized that if I alter the weekly chart with the 24 and 28 ema's that it takes the whole concept out of calculating momentum. Do we disregard that and base it on direction of the 24 and 28 ema's on the weekly? If I recall correctly this calculation was able to predict any medium term reversal. Any comments to this?

I've taken Dial's chart in post #193 and took it apart. Its the first trade he highlighed from end of July to middle of August (up move). This is a first stab at at overlaying my own discretionary system on to the tunnel and see what happens. All this is work in progress and I foresee drastic changes once the private forum opens and I can see what Dial's been upto.

Just for giggles, I overlaid a BWILC Median Grid over the Fibonacci lines on the EUR/USD 4 hour chart. This might be a useful discretionary addition to the vegas 4 hour method. No hard and fast rules, just an idea. I wasn't sure whether to post this here or in the BWILC thread. Dial

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Thanx Dial, Iv'e been toying with this too! (I BOUGHT ! BWILC Last week) I wanted to overlay the grid on my tunnel profiles but he mentions that there should be a reletively centered 20-40 pip band .....I ain't seein it! Your quads look good. I missed the last momentum/trend change. I'm in the no-trade zone---exceeded the drawdown limit for my beer and pretzel account. Don't tell Santa! HJ

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hey all, I’m glad you found the Vegas e-mail enlightening. I’ll quickly respond to some of your comments regarding my post: -“In reference to adding the daily, must it agree with the weekly along with a northern moving 8 EMA on the 4hr in order to confirm a buy?” My guess is YES; as Volan and Dial have pointed out, the gap is too big between the signals of the 4-hour and the weekly. I think they are fine tuning momentum using a daily chart. Thanks for the welcome, Dial. Volan found me in StrategyBuilder and told me about ForexFactory. -Regarding the Vegas e-mail address, I used trafficcap@hotmail.com -“Was there any more information from Vegas in the email?” There was one other thing but I did not include it in my first post because I did not want to get anyone's hopes up but Vegas offered to send me a plug-in for mt4 if I wanted it. So, I replied that I would be grateful for any files they would like to share and ...bingo, bango, bongo...I just received another e-mail from them! I have not even tried this indicator yet but I'll attach the file to this thread for you all. Here is the e-mail that came with the attachment: Claude, Thank you for your gracious compliments. I am attaching the "Vegas Daily Currency" plugin for metatrader. When you use the indicator, here are the model #'s and respective fib lines they produce on the daily or weekly chart: Model #1 - 89, 144, 233 Model #2 - 144, 233, 377 Model #3 - 233, 377, 610 Model #4 - 377, 610, 987 Use the appropriate model for any currency pair. -vegas Could some of you pros have a look at this and tell us how to apply it? I am just starting to use the Vegas 4-hour with mini lots. My goal is to achieve Dial’s performance of averaging 66 pips in 43 days. -Hey, I might as well dream in HDTV! Claude in Calgary, Alberta

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Way to go KW!!! I can't wait to take a look at your attachment and see what goodies you've gotten for us...Just in time for christmas. I've actually modified Iso's MACD (Thanks again Iso). He was kind enough to make the inputs user definable. To get the daily instead of weekly MACD I changed 10080 to 1440 and I'm still using 5 and 21 MAs, but maybe I'll take a look at changing them as per Vegas' suggestion.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Gentlemen, with this new method, and correct me if I am wrong, there are no current buy or short signals... I do not see a weekly, daily, and 4hr agreeing on any currency.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hey xspowersx! Have you tried this on the cable. Claude's note gives specific "Model Data " for this. I have to say i am perplexed by the daily indicators! I guess I don't understand what the 28/24 ema element is telling me. Except that I Think! it's telling me to get an asprin. I haven't applied it to the cable yet. (Vegas gives some specific model info for that pair) But if any of you smart guys would like to pontificate on the merits of this new development. I probably would believe anything you would say. Remember how much sense the original V4 docs made? Well I ain't gettin this. If some one would explain their understanding of this I would be most greatful.....I may revert to coin flip entry in the interim! Merry Christmas HJ

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hey Dial, What is the dotted green line thingy on this chart? HJ

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Has anyone noticed that the indicator sent by Vegas looks suspiciously like the one 1-hr method indicator posted at "http://www.freewebs.com/mswilson/" by SlavaFX? I had posted this link in post #135. Since it looks so much like the original 1-hr method, I wonder if the Vegas team has gone back to their roots and are using a similar methodology on the 4-hr. The 24/28 are very close and make a very tight "channel". If the Vegas team has gone to their roots, they may be using a channel methodoloty. In that case they may be looking for opporunities when the price is either above or below the 24/28 channel. Here's my interpretation of what the new indicators are being used for. I'm not convineced that we are looking for increase/decrease in momentum with the 24/28, I think that If the price is above the 24/28 channel on the daily and on the weekly AND momentum is increasing (as per usual) then look for long opportunities on the 4-hr. Similarly for short opportunities. What do you guys think of my interpretation of the new Vegas information? Does anyone have any other ideas of how the 24/28 can be used?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yes you are right. You will notice that the the equivalent of the daily 24/28 EMAs on the 4-hour chart is 144/168, almost the same as the 144/169 EMAs used on the 1-hour tunnel. And I prefer the 4-hour version. Add the TrendManager and 5/13/62 EMAs and I might be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. Regards, Matsu

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hey HeavyJ thanks for replying. I do trade CABLE. I monitor all currencies. I think with the new model we have our first sell signal! AUDJPY spotted at 85.12. Short entered 85.12 Stop: When 8 turns positive. Lets see how we do gentlemen. BTW this is not a real trade.

Hey guys, your recent posts are great! This is exactly the kind of brainstorming and sharing of ideas that I hope to see in the Knife section of the PF.

Great job guys! Keep it up! Dial

Thanx to Claude, I looked back and saw I was trying to email Vegas with the wrong address (I was using "trafficcop" instead of "trafficcap") Claude's email was almost identicle to my original email and served the purpose. Still I wanted to personally thank Vegas and compliment him on his work as well as his sharing nature! Anyway, I pestered him again for some clarification on the Daily and he offered this generous reply. :surprised A very kind man. The bonehead is stepping out of the way now to let the wise speak. heres the email back and forth. Can't wait for Charles to digest this and stimulate some disscussion Can't wait till Iso starts to finesse this ......maybe some new toys for the tree! Merry Christmas All! HeavyJ

HeavyJ, thanks for kicking it up a notch, taking the Vegas connection to a new level and for the Christmas card. -Claude in Alberta ('trafficcop' - Yeah, I can just see Vegas - FX master trader by night but his day job is standing in the middle of The Strip, blowing a whistle and waving his white gloved hands at drivers).

--- 帖子 #231 ---
This is pure gold. Thanks HeavyJ!!! So, it looks like he's using the fib numbers on the longer timeframes to look for overbought/oversold conditions and therefore signalling trend changes. Since determining the trend is the crux of the method (and the most difficult thing for me to determine) the new document will probably be very enlightening. I'm really pumped about this system. Thanks to everyone on this thread for your support and guidance. I love that we're all learning together. And I really love that everybody is respectful of everybody else, even if they ask (like I do) dumb questions. Merry christmas all!!!

Gentlement! This is great! Remember those trades I posted last night? GBPJPY: + 90 pips CHFJPY: +15 pips AUDJPY: +50 pips This is great! Less than a month now and I will try to take this system live. Have a wonderful holiday everyone.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hey, great work! I don't have CHFJPY, nor AUDJPY, but I do have GBPJPY and I'm looking at my indicators trying to figure out what it was that made you pull the trigger at 202.60. Were you using the new 24/28 channel? If so, how.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hey Matsu, could you describe your chart more? Perhaps if you could label the MA's it would make it more clear. Also, what are the blue/red bars near the middle? Presumably that's the TrendManager; how does it work and where can I get the indicator?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hey Volan. Yes, I was using the method with the new updates. What made me pull the final trigger was seeing the Weekly's down, Daily-down trending, and finally the 8 SMA down as well. I entered them a little late for the 8 was trending down much earlier but I didn't see them till I got home and opened my system. One thing I didn't incorporate yet was the fib numbers.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
You mention the daily down trending. Is that the 24/28 MAs downtrending. I see the weekly has reached a peak and is now heading down and I see my daily (5/21 EMA) going down, but the rate of change is decreasing, telling me that there may be a short-term trend change to the upside. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Volan, with this new method is seems like the 'momentum calculation' figures are completely eliminated. This is not stated but implied by Vegas in the new email. On the 240 min, I use the 8. On the Daily, I use the 24/28 EMA's. On the Weekly, I use the 24/28 EMA's as well. I followed his directions exactly as he wrote them on "version 1.0" and reprogramed it on "version 2.0" LOL.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
That's exactly what I was thinking. The achilles heel of the 1-hr method was chop around the channel. vegas suggested using a 12EMA to try and filter the chop. Presumably chop will be a problem here too. Vegas' latest email to HeavyJ seems to indicate that he's using the 24/28 system as an overbought/oversold indicator. I'm interested in seeing his new method.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Whatever he uses it for it generated a 80% gain for me overnight and I like that LOL. Do you have a messanger? We can talk more over that. PM me your name on any messanger. I prefer paltalk

Just PM'd you.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
First, thanks to HeavyJ for emailing Vegas and for sharing Vegas' reply. Cool beans HeavyJ!! Thanks! If I'm reading everyone's posts correctly, I think there is a misunderstanding of the placement of the 24 and 28 EMAs on the charts. In the first email from Vegas, he used the word "respectively" but his sentence structure in the first email did not make it clear what was with respect to what. However, the second email did clear that up. I'll quote the relevant passage here: The way I read this, one does not put both EMAs on the same chart. In other words, there is no tunnel as on the original one hour system. The word "respectively" in the passage above means, to me at least, that the 24 EMA goes on the daily chart, and the 28 EMA goes on a weekly chart, with this weekly chart being different from the weekly chart used to determine trend. I agree with xspowerx that the original weekly chart (with the 21 &amp; 5 MAs) is probably no longer used. Instead, the new daily (with 24 EMA &amp; fibs) and weekly (with 28 EMA &amp; fibs) is used. Once these two indicate a potentially strong move is building (and I'm not sure how to do this yet) one would then look at either the original 1 hour chart OR the original 4 hour chart for "confirmation" (Vegas' word) depending on which method was being traded. See attached image. Does all this make any sense? Dial

Hi Volan, I hope the chart is clearer now. This is just one possible way to use Vegas's new information. I have chosen the 5/13/62 EMA system here. Yes the blue and red bars are the TrendManager. The default setting is 7, 2. I have set it at 42, 2 to get the equivalent on the daily chart. If you go to the link in buff's post http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...43&amp;postcount=3 you can get a good description on its use. Regards, Matsu

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi Dial, if you placed Vegas's indicator on the chart, you will note that both the 24 and 28 EMAs are there. So I think the tunnel is still there. Regards, Matsu

--- 帖子 #244 ---
You have a point. What then do they mean by the use of the word "respectively"? To me, the use of that word means to pair the items in one list to the items in another list: Daily to 24 and Weekly to 28. Unless their wording is poor or they don't understand the proper use of the word. What do you think? Dial

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Heavy J, yes, I have heard of it. In fact I wrote it.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I would like to think that it is probably wrong choice of word, else the indicator would only have one EMA, and by selecting either Model #3 or #4 you would have the appropriate EMA displayed for the weekly, while Model #1 and #2 would display the EMA for daily chart. In Vegas's reply to HeavyJ he used the words 'daily tunnel' I would like to believe the tunnel is still there, instead of just one EMA. Regards, Matsu

how can i join this pf please?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Vegas I've just had a quick look at the code and it looks like you're plotting fib levels of the 28 ema for all risk models. Dial has already commented on this passage earlier: So, what we do is create daily and weekly charts [any currency pair] and then overlay on these a 24 and 28 ema, respectively. Now we plot the appropriate fib levels onto the daily and weekly charts. I agree with Dial that your usage of the word "respectively" implies the 24 for daily &amp; 28 for weekly. So could the code be wrong? Also parameters MA1 &amp; MA2 don't seem to be used anywhere at all since the actual values are hard coded! Thanks for taking time to answer these questions!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi Vegas! First off let me personally thank you for joining us in order to answer questions. I, myself, and probably many others, really do appreciate that. I have read your tunnel method once, twice, programmed it, read it a third time, reprogrammed with the new daily in it, read it more, printed it out, and read it about 4 more times before I went to bed to makes sure I completly understand it, LOL. I have been in it for about the last month and a half. So as you can see, I am a big fan of it. My first question is, can you answer us in this current debat. Do we plot both the 24 and 28 EMA's on the weekly and daily or just the 24 on the weekly and just the 28 on the daily? I have been testing it with both EMA's on both charts and it seemed to produce relatively good results, acually so good I think 8 out of 10 trades were positive. My second question is, above, I posted 3 trades, all against the JPY, on Thursday. Can you check those to see if I am on the right track with this method? Were there indeed short signals at those prices at that time? If you can't find it, here it is, I posted them Thursday. AUDJPY spotted at 85.12. CHFJPY Short: entered at 88.84 GBPJPY Short: entered at 202.62 Hope you and your family have a wonderful Christmas. Thanks in advance. -S Power

Thank you Vegas for honoring our thread with a visit (hopefully a long one :-). As you can see, your methods have created a following of excited people, but people with many questions. As you may have read, we will have a training forum opening in January. As a part of that forum, I have taken your 4 hour method as I understand and trade it and will be presenting it with much text and many images so that the greatest number of brand new traders can benefit from your system. Just so you'll understand the reference, I've called the system "Knife" to differentiate it from your 4 hour tunnel document, although the two are 97% identical. I've deviated primarily in the use of discretion. And that leads me to my question: As you have stated, the 4 hour model is most susceptible to losses during trend changes. I see the reason for this as being that the momentum indication (diff between 21 &amp; 5) is lagging price action. Therefore, I have been using discretion in choosing trade direction. But, I don't always get it right and sometimes I hurt rather than help myself. I've thought about using the momentum indicator purely as UP and DOWN and can see statistically that trading in those "binary" directions only should result in profit over a long series of trades. BUT, I was trying to use discretion to cut down on some of those losses at trend change. Okay, too much blabbing. Here's my question. When you trade the 4 hour method, do you follow th UP and DOWN trend indication mechanically, without any use of discretion? Is this profitable? Do you recommend that? If you do, or were to apply discretion, could you give us some guidelines please? The is the one part of your method that is giving me fits. Again, Thanks for joining us with the offer to answer a few questions. It is appreciated far more than you realize. Hope you have a Merry Christmas. Dial (Charles)

Hi, I'm trying to backtest and follow the original trades of the 4 hour vegas tunnel. The document states for period 1/01/04 - 1/23/04, BUY ONLY, PL = 600 Using different parameters I can get between 583 and 959.5 The calculations are if 3 lots gain 10pips, this makes 30pips on the trade, not 10 pips on the movement. So far so good. The document then states for trading period 1/23/04 - 5/21/04, SELL ONLY with PL of 2,075 However, mechanically, I can't get anywhere near this, ranging from -0.5 to 979.5 Has anyone tried this and got close to 2,075 ? If Vegas is reading, if you still have the original calculations/ spreadsheet/ trades/ scribblings, then I would love to have them to clarify my understanding of the system. Merry Christmas Alan

Looking for fib indicator for mq4. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hey ktrade; The fib lines in vegas' method is not really a standalone indicator. They are simply parallel lines drawn a specific number of pips away from a moving average line. Look at post number 204 where Dialist does a great job of showing how the fib lines are put onto a chart. He's got screenshots and all. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I've done a partial backtest for the second period. I got 2469 pips just through March 9th. Just eyeballing the charts I can see I would get more through the end of the sell cycle at 5/21/04. I would have done the whole period but I've got inlaws wanting feeding so I've got to go. I did this kind of quickly so be wary of any errors I might have made. Are you taking both primary and secondary signals? If you take just the primaries, you'll miss out on a lot of pips. FYI, I entered my "trades" 20 pips beyond the neutral line, and exited either when a fib level was hit or price moved 20 pips beyond the neutral line in the opposite direction. Dial

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Dial, Could you clarify "neutral line" here. Is that the 50 pip zone or maybe the 8 bar BE? Just want to make sure I understand you! Thanx HJ

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi HeavyJ, See post 26 of this thread. At the beginning of each 4 hour bar, I enter a trailing entry 20 pips beyond the neutral line with three "units". At the same time that I set the trailing entry, I also set a trailing stop 20 pips on the opposite side of the neutral line. I cancel these entries and put in fresh ones every four hours at the beginning of the next bar. If a trade is in progress, then I simply update the trailing stop to be 20 pips beyond the neutral line for the current bar. There are occasions when doing the trailing stop this way doesn't make sense. In those few cases, I'll set a technical stop based on recent price movement, as long as it does not result in my increasing the size of my stop. In that case, I just leave the stop where it is. Dial

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hey K&lt; If you want the MT4 templates that Vegas sent to Claude, look at the bottom of his post # 220, I posted an email from vegas that explains what settings he uses on the different major pairs if that is what your referring to. There are diferrent fib bands for different time frames and currencies. HJ

Hi, Thanks for your reply. I was taking both primary and secondary trades. Entry at close of 4hr bar at the close price. I was hoping to duplicate the original results without any tweaks. I'll have a look and put the tweak of +/-20 from the neutral line and report back. Thanks again for doing the backtest. Best regards Alan

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Good deal Alan. One other thing. I took profit when the price hit the CURRENT fib level, and NOT what the fib level was at the time the trade was entered. I'm sure you're aware of this, but for those who aren't, the fib levels are dynamic and change from bar to bar. Since price is attracted to the fib levels I adjust the two limits in my order every four hours. If the fib levels are moving in the direction of my trade, this allows me to capture a few more pips. Dial P.S. The date of the second trade in the spreadsheet is wrong. It should be 1-28 instead of 1-27.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I can't seem to get it one good trade on this in the last week. Gotta keep trying!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
It's been a choppy week. Usually is around Christmas. I suspect volume has been low as well. Things should pick back up after New Years. Just remember to wait for the signals before entering rather than anticipating them. Remember to think of your trading as a sniper's rifle rather than a machine gun. Don't shoot at everything that moves. Pick your target carefully, then squeeze off that one shot. Dial

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi, Move over HeavyJ, I'm about to take over your title for being a boneheaded trader : Thanks again Diallist for your backtested results, it gives me something to compare against. Boneheaded point No.1 As I understand it, the value of the weekly momentum only 'finalises' at the end of the week and until the market closes on Fri, I would not know the value of the momentum for that week, so I could not trade mon-fri based on the close of the momentum of that week. On my chart (datafeed based on NY time, 4hr bars aligned to 0:00), Momentum for week ending 16/1/04 is 542.20 Momentum for week ending 23/1/04 is 559.33 Momentum for week ending 30/1/04 is 554.20 Momentum for week ending 06/2/04 is 526.63 In 'theory' I would not 'short' until after 30/1/04 as until the close of the week it is not certain that the momentum has turned south. Diallist had a short on 23/1/04 at 1.2693 for +300 which I will put to one side for the moment until I can determine what the program should mechanically do with going short on a higher weekly momentum. Boneheaded point No.2 The original vegas document had a weekly filter "If the difference between the 21 EMA and the 5 EMA is &gt; 500 pips, then the pip difference from the prior week must change by more than 10 pips, or just go lower over 2 consecutive weeks, to signal a trend change." From the numbers in point no.1, weekly momentum is over 500 pips and the change from 23/1/04 to 30/1/04 is less than 10 pips, so once again in my boneheaded 'theory', the momentum could still be up and only 'longs' should be taken until after 06/2/04 where it has definitely dropped for 2 consecutive weeks. Boneheaded point No.3 Thanks, saved me pulling my hair out Diallist has a short (lot 1) on 28/1/04 at 1.2539 to hit fib144 at 1.2412 for 127pips Exit I have no problem with as mine comes out at 1.2408, close enough This could all be to do with datafeed or 4hr bar alignment and I'd like to find out which. On my chart, the bar ending at 16:00 closes at 1.2514 with 8 MA rising from previous bar to 1.2603 The close 8 bars ago is 27/1/04 1.2486 Thus the neutral price is 1.2486 My boneheaded understanding (20pip rule) is if the price now goes below 1.2466 (low is 1.2459) then you would short at 1.2466 which is the price I get, short at 1.2466, exit 1.2408 for 58pips How did you get an entry at 1.2539? I've attached a chart. Short on the hollow red arrow Cover on the hollow green arrow The middle dotted line is the price 1.2486 from 8 bars ago from the short. Red line is 8 MA Close (4hr) Blue line is 55 MA (H+L/2)(4hr) Light Blue dotted line is fib144 from 55MA Brown line is 5 MA (H+L/2) weekly I would be grateful if anyone could help me out of my boneheadedness Best regards Alan

Hey Firehorse, I think you missed the new update. He has a V2.0 out by email to one of our members who kindly shared it with us. It eliminated the calculation of weekly momentum. In my opinion, I think its better.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thanks for the relief. Its good to know that. I do enter right when I get the signal and it seems like I've been stopped out on most before. However, when I look back in history it seems to trend perfectly fine. Makes me think its only my luck haha

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Greetings xspowersX just Curious how tight your playing your stops on this? I think Mine were way to tight. I have re-evaluated this after PURCHASING and reading BWILC Lets get 'em next year HJ

Unfortunately, history only shows the last thing that happened. For example, if history shows a slope change that began a long trend, that is not the whole story. Sure, that 4 hour bar ended up on a permanent slope change, but it may have switched slope a couple of times before settling down. I don't know what you are using for an entry signal, so I'll assume you're inputting trailing entries at the beginning of a 4 hour bar to trigger when the price moves 20 pips beyond the neutral line and you're setting your stop to close the trade if the price moves back to 20 pips on the opposite side of the neutral line (effectively, a 40 pip stop). Here's what can happen: You've set your entry stop order and stop loss as just described at the beginning of the 4 hour bar and you walk away from your computer. While you're away the entry stop order triggers and you are now short. An hour later, the price reverses, crosses the neutral line and hits your stop. Yet a little later, the price moves across the neutral line again and begins a long move down. Unfortunately, you are not in. So the historical record shows a signal that resulted in a long winning trade. But, the historical record does not show that the slope dithered a couple of times before settling down, taking out your trade in the process. You can decrease the likelyhood of this scenario by increasing the size of your stop by setting the stop more than 20 pips beyond the neutral line, to give the trade more breathing room. The cost of course will be an increase in the size of your loss per trade, but if it results in fewer stop outs, your overall losses will actually decrease. It is a balancing act. Another option would be to keep the 40 pip stop, and simply monitor your charts so that if your trailing entry does get triggered and then stopped out, you can re-enter the trailing entry to catch the final slope change that becomes part of the historical record. As you can see, there is no easy solution since most of us can't be glued to our monitors all day. As a general recommendation, if you are getting stopped out a lot, especially from what ends up being a good trade, then you need to increase the size of your stop. Two questions for you: What are you using for your entry signal? The close of the bar across the neutral line, or a fixed number of pips or just visually seeing the slope change? Second, how are you setting your stops? A fixed pip amount; a certain number of pips beyond the neutral line, or perhaps just beyond the last swing high or low? Dial

--- 帖子 #271 ---
You may be right, but I'm not yet convinced the addition of the daily chart and the 24 &amp; 28 ma's is a replacement for the weekly trend indication. Perhaps more a supplement to it. We'll have to wait for Vegas to reply to this thread to know for sure (hope he hasn't forgotten us ) For my part, since I've already got lots of screenshots in the PF detailing the use of the weekly trend chart, I'm going to leave it in place. Any updates I get from Vegas will be included as appendices to the main system description. Dial

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi, I'm floundering a bit here. The original 4 hr tunnel should be profitable but I think I don't understand the rules properly because I cannot as yet duplicate the original results. The new 20pip rule by Diallist seems even better but I can't seem to duplicate his results from the above post as yet. There's a misunderstanding somewhere. The updated rules by vegas seems to be in development and there is nothing to compare against at the moment. I would prefer if I could understand the discrepancies above before moving onto another system along this theme. Best regards Alan

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi all, I've been a member here for a while, but I don't think I've ever posted. I post a lot at other forums and just never quite got around to FF very often. Wow, was that a mistake. You guys are great. I've been interested in the Vegas method for a few months and I've played around with the indicators by Spiggy and tried making my own adjustments. I'm still in that demo/learning stage of my trading career so this thread has been really enjoyable to read. I think the thing I like most about the 4 Hour Tunnel is that it is not "gimmicky" to me. Maybe that sounds dumb, but there are so many new "super-duper make-you-rich-in-a-month" strategies out there that it makes it difficult for a new trader to focus on making something work. The 4hr Tunnel seems to just be based on a solid foundation and if it is traded with some discretion, it should be profitable. Anyway, back to my reason for posting. I've found that if you use a 25 HMA (Hull Moving Average) on the 4hr chart instead of the 8 SMA it gives cleaner signals. The REAL turns happen at pretty much the same time, but because it is so much smoother, it filters out a lot of the "head fakes" that the 8 SMA gives. The 8 SMA tends to make a lot of small "bounces" when there is a small retrace in price causing it to officially change direction (even if by only a few pips and for only 1 bar), which according to the system takes you out of the trade. The 25 HMA smoothes right through those small retraces. I also found that replacing the 55 SMA on the 4hr with a 233 HMA gives interesting results. It follows the twists and turns of the 55 SMA pretty evenly, but during ranging markets it tends to stay a little further away from price, thus, when you get bounced in and out of the market due to turns on the Short MA, you are only entering with 1/2 positions. I'm attaching a picture to show you what I mean. The SMAs are the thin lines and the HMA are the thicker lines. Also, I'm attaching the HMA.mq4 file for Metatrader. You can find more info about the Hull Moving Average at Alan Hull's website under the Articles section (or just Google it). I don't think I'm allowed to post an actual link to a website yet. If you click on the Articles section it takes you to a site where he sells a newsletter. (Lots of good free articles too) I'm not affiliated with that in any way. I just want you to know where to go to find info on the HMA and he gives a full description of it there and shows you the formula. Well, I guess this is long enough for a first post. Thanks again for a great thread. I look forward to contributing here. Keris

Hi Keris, I too have been playing around with the vegas tunnel and trying to work out how to trade it in a more mechanical fashion. I came across the HMA a few weeks ago and found it to be a pretty good little indicator. Seems to have very little lag. The one I have been using is 'HMA in colour'. It changes colour as the trend turns...but here is the problem. I am not 100% sure that once the bar has finished that the colour will remain changed. Anyone willing to test it? I first thought of putting this indicator on the weekly chart in place of the 28ema that Vegas mentioned as it seemed ( to me) to be giving more direction. Anyway this is the HMA in colour on a setting of 21

Hi Diallist Thanks for taking the trouble of posting a chart. Guess what! We're both right I shifted my 'start of day' to 2:00 rather than 0:00 and now my 4 hr bars have the same shape as yours. Interesting point to note 1) My close on the bar 8 is 1.2567 so would have entered at 1.2547. 2) my low on your exit bar is 1.2410 not touching the fib144 at 1.2408 so the trade would have exited later. Attaching picture but I haven't changed the wording. I'll go back and recheck the other trades. Thanks again for your clarification. Best regards Alan

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi First, many thanks again for Diallist for taking the time to do a quick backtest for me so that I have some sort of reference point. I've updated the eurusd spreadsheet with my results. By my calculations, there appears to be a few non-mechanical trades. 23/01/04 Diallist has a short trade where I calculate momentum appears to be up. 02/02/04 Program picks up an extra mechanical trade 09/02/04 Program picks up an extra mechanical trade 11/02/04 Diallist has entry on 2nd bar after change in MA 8 slope whereas mechanically, the program only enters on the first bar after change 20/02/04 Secondary trade, Diallist had full points 25/02/04 Secondary trade, Diallist had full points 01/03/04 Secondary trade, Diallist had full points. Also had an fib377 exit for a fib233 exit 09/03/04 Diallist had a trade but 4hr momentum by my calculation appears to be below 50 Taking all of Diallist trades, my total of the same trades is 1497.5 Taking strict trades only, my total is 1351.5 The good news is that for the period 1/23/04 to 21/5/04 I now get a strict total of 2307.5, better than 2075 in the original vegas document. However running the program for a longer period: Strict trades for 2004 is 4981.5 in 110 trades Strict trades for 2004 to 1/7/05 is 4838 in 148 trades Still a little short on the 7500 in the original document. Divide 4838 by 3 to get the number of points per 'risk on trade' =&gt; 1612.6 Minus 3pt spread per trade (444) =&gt; 1168.6 Over 18 months =&gt; 65 points per month Max drawdown is in the 1500pt range, or 500pt if divided by 3. Note my mechanical method of stoploss is the lowest low, or highest high of the last 3 bars. Backtesting program is still subject to error and tweaking although it appears to be in the ballpark figure now and catching the right sort of entries and exits. Note that the results are without any other considerations of support/resistance, fib retracements, price action etc. Also remember the result is only for one currency. I haven't yet put the results through a spreadsheet to calculate p/l on cash. Thanks again to Diallist for putting in the time to give me something to compare against Best regards Alan

I was also searching for a 'smoother' alternative to the SMA for use in the tunnel method. I've been fiddling with the HMA for a little while now and it seems that it would provide fewer unprofitable signals. It does tend to be much smoother than SMA. One thing I would LIKE to try (but don't have the software to do as I don't believe there is a release for any of the free charting software I use) is to try the Jurik MA. JMA may be even better than HMA - has anyone got the facilities to check this? I haven't traded using the HMA yet but I plan to start in another few months. I look forward to seeing the material that will be presented in the PF soon Cheers, Linc.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I have a copy of JMA for MT4, but it's not an official version. Officially they don't make one for mt4. I believe they sell a dll that's supposted to work with MT. The mq4 file that I have is supposed to be based off of the original source and from what I've heard is pretty much spot on compared to the official software. I'd post it, but I don't know what the forum policy is in regards to this since it's not an official version. Of course, if it was official, i.e. licensed, then I couldn't legally share that either. If Merlin ok's it, I'll post the .mq4 file for MT4. BTW, both JMA and HMA are good. HMA is a little faster and JMA is can be a little smoother. Here's some pics showing the differences. 8 sma 25 hma 14 jma 25 jma They also have the 55 sma and 233 hma: http://img329.imageshack.us/img329/6...ajma1su.th.gif http://img329.imageshack.us/img329/8...ices2rw.th.gif http://img359.imageshack.us/img359/2...term6pw.th.gif

Hi Guys, Bit of a misconception that I am a tunnel Guru....far from it and what you have all done so far on this thread is really great. I like the Vegas tunnels a lot and had a lot of success trading them demo but I then ran into difficulties with discretion. It is like a project in progress for me to try and formulate a tunnel system that is purely mechanical. If anyone wants the JMA just send me a pm. I will add what I can to this thread but it really seems you have done a pretty good job. Back to the drawing board..... Happy New Year Everyone!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Since 8/55 crosses are such an important part of the system I was wondering if you could add the 55 SMA to the chart so that it can be seen where they cross and how much of a difference there is between each line.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I added the 55 sma to my above pic as well as the 233 hma, which I tend to think keeps us small during ranging markets. I don't know that replacing the 55 sma with the 233 hma will better, it's just something I've been playing with. I also added 2 pics with the prices removed, showing a larger time period.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Gentlemen with all do respect I believe were starting to stray away from the version that Vegas either posted or updated us with in the email. Then again I may be wrong because the above posts are confusing with new techniques implied and backtested.

Great job Alan! Thanks for taking the time to be so thorough in your backtesting. Now as to the errors. They're mine, and I take full credit for them! You lost me here. Why are you dividing by three? Dial

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi volan, Um, I'm curious as to why you think 8/55 crosses are an important part of the system. I've seen nothing in the original document that indicates crosses are used at all, much less being important. I think that is main beauty of the system is the lack of ma crosses. Perhaps I missed something in an earlier post of yours that is keeping me from understanding. Thanks volan for your continuing contributions! Dial

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I think Volan is referring to the position sizing aspect of the 8/55 cross. When the 8 crosses the 55 and turns, take a full position. When the 8 turns without having crossed the 55, take 1/2 position.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I was wondering the same thing, although the Vegas doc does suggest choosing a unit size and then trading 3 units (or 1 1/2). I think this is the wrong way of describing it, as it implies that you determine your position size and them multiply it by 3, thus, on each trade, risking 3 times what your money management method tells you to do. That's probably not what they meant, but that's kind of how it sounds. I think we should do just the opposite. Determine our position size, based on whatever money management method we use, and then divide by 3 to determine how much to take off at each fib level. With trading platforms offering micro lots now (or any-size lots at oanda ), this is easy to do. We don't have to trade in 3-lot (or mini lot) multiples.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks keris! I suspected that might be what volan meant. Dial

--- 帖子 #299 ---
That's exactly my view as well keris. In fact, I like to be even more conservative by rounding down the money management trade size to a multiple of three before dividing. Example: if the MM says you can trade 17 lots, I would round that down to 15 first and then divide by 3 to give a "unit" size of 5 lots. A half unit would be the 5 divided by 2 = 2.5 rounded down to 2 lots per half unit. Doing the half units by rounding down the 17 to a multiple of 6, which is 12 and then dividing by three would give a half unit size of 4 lots which is too high. Better in my opinion to go with the more conservative 5/2 rather than 5/4. Keris, I am really enjoying your contributions to this thread regarding the use of HMA and JMA. Thanks for that! Dial

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hey Keris, thanks for posting the images comparing SMA/JMA/HMA. It is interesting to compare them. I might upgrade to some charting software that can support the official JMA at some point, although it looks as though HMA might be just as good. It is an interesting trade-off: HMA gets you in earlier but will have more of those jittery close-outs when the trend changes, while JMA will get you in slightly later (a less optimal start?) but will give you a smoother ride (and potentially a greater range that you can pull your profit from). Just by eye-balling the charts, I would say that HMA would perform better than a SMA to trigger a trade and keep you in the trade. I also looked at some other 'modified' MA such as T3 but decided that HMA would provide a better result than the others. Another similar indicator that I picked up somewhere was the "Hull Trend" indicator for MT4. If you were going to use the change of slope of the HMA to determine the trend (as HMA moves upwards the trend is up; when the slope of the HMA changes down the trend is moving down). The "hull trend" indicator shows pretty much the same trend except for a few odd bars during a major trend that show a 1-3 bar counter-trend movement. Thanks for the help with the JMA. The FF is great - I wish I had found this forum a long time ago Cheers, Linc.

Hi, Thanks. I just like to know where my money is going after paying my tuition fee Now as to the errors. They're mine, and I take full credit for them! You lost me here. Why are you dividing by three? Ignored I'm dividing by three to determine the equivalent number of pips I would get if I had been trading 1 lot or 'risk amount' or my '2% per trade'. The Vegas method calls for splitting your 'trade' up into 3 and exiting each part separately. If a 'trade' enters and exits for a gain of 10 points on all three parts, then in the profit calculations in the document it is counted as 30 points, which doesn't really reflect what will happen into my account. My account will reflect a gain of 10 points on what I risked on the trade, so for me, I need to divide the total points by three to get an idea of what I will get in my account. I hope that is clear. Best regards Alan

Hi, It was just before bed before I posted my results so I missed taking out a variable I had set to always take 'short' trades regardless of weekly momentum. After I removed this and ran the backtest again I get 2170.5 pips for the period 1/1/04 to 1/7/05 with a drawdown in the range 1800. Note that this figure is still inaccurate because it uses the current weekly momentum calculation during Mon-Fri so it 'knows' the weekly momentum calculation before the week has ended, which you wouldn't do in real life. Note that the 4hr 50 pip momentum is determined using the previous bar and is correct in that respect in what you will know in real life but doesn't help if the current 'bar' enters a trade and that bar's momentum closes below 50 pips. I've updated spreadsheet (on sheet 2) detailing all the trades so that if anyone has the inclination, they can have a go at spotting where I could have made mistakes in the backtesting. Best regards Alan

Happy New Year folks! There has been a lot of great discussion, tips, potions. etc.... on entering in respect to the V4 docs and tweaks! I would like some feedback on exiting positions as called out by V4 ...please see passage below! (bear run) Cut up further still- I can see this as a sort of exit retreat. Does he mean slope change at the print of the new 4hr bar? and does this exit apply throughout the life of the trade? as hinted here? The way I read this Vegas would exit the position any time the slope prints against him regardless of profit level. Am I getting this? Sounds simple enough....just wanted some affirmation! Good day all HJ

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Yep, that's the Vegas way. However, toward the end of the document, under the Risk Models section, they list a possible alternative action to take upon slope reversal: (We) may not take off entire position at slight change in slope of 8 SMA on the 4 hour chart. Most likely scenario is to take partial profit, with stop based on technicals for remaining position. Even so, Vegas never quantifies a slope change. That is why I use a neutral line and filter the slope change either by looking for the bar to close beyond the neutral line, or for a certain number pips beyond the neutral line. (see my post #26 [or is it #13]) The reason I filter the slope change is that in real time, the price can dither the slope back and forth every few seconds for many minutes before it finally moves beyond it. Personally, I rarely exit on a slope reversal. I prefer to use a trailing stop instead. FYI, I currently trail a 50 pip stop once the trade has moved 30 pips into profit. But this is subject to change as I continue to refine my interpretation of this model. Dial

Thanx Dial This seems to be an improvement HJ

I was just wondering if it is a good idea to look into trading different currency pairs throught this system. If we only trade the US currency pairs (USD/AUD, USD/CAD, EUR/USD), we might come to a point where US currency is in a trading range. At this point there is a chance that any pair involving US currency might also be in a trading range. On the other hand if someone is trading EUR/USD, AUD/JPY, USD/CAD or GBP/JPY, it might have a better outcome. Any ideas to why one should trade the original currency pairs as in Vegas 4 hr Tunnel? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Refering to the 8/55 I completely eliminated the 55 off my charts. I simply use directional movement of 8 in compliance with weekly and daily momentum. I have the same problem as firehorse though, I am having trouble achieving the same results as Vegas stated in the document. Also, last we heard Vegas is writing a document on the updated version of the tunnel method as well as how he trades futures. Should be out soon. Will Vegas ever come back? BTW, I wish everyone a happy, profitable, and fun New Year!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
That's exactly what I meant. I believe (and correct me if I'm wrong) Dial calls it a primary signal as opposed to a secondary signal given when there is no cross.

Here's a chart that looks OK in perfect, technicolor 20/20 hindsight. I did not take this setup due to bonehead reasons. Got to admire this system tho! If I had I would be knee deep in tacos right now! 710 pips on 3 primary and 3 secondary positions. Dial....Jump in if I'm off somewhere! HJ

hmmmmm but the 24 28 on the weekly are flat, which eliminated and type of trading, no?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I have been interested in the theories you and Volan have proffered on the use of the new vegas indicator but to be honest, I don't get it! I'm not saying you don't get it. You may. But I am anxiously awaiting the new V-Daily doc for what I hope will be a more thorough explaination. In the mean time...... I was just wondering if the new indicators were maybe causing you to miss the forrest for the trees so to speak. The reason I bring that up is because, clearly, this was a big payoff week for those who wait for a V4 setup and you had said that you weren't having any luck. The stuff you need to catch this move is in this thread! I just reread it from Post #26 Dials got some great stuff on here and I Luv Isotonics commentary. Once again! Please don't take me the wrong way.....I Watched as this opportunity passed me by. I did not follow the system because I was exploring another system......The Bonehead system! Whereby I saw these setups but had a preconcieved notion that the Dollar would swing strong. It's the bone head way! but I enjoy your posts and comments and am trying to understand your thinking...... Anywho!!! Lets get after it this year! HJ

--- 帖子 #314 ---
HeavyJ, you are doin' great! Don't sweat the trades you missed. keep focused on what's coming up. Did you happen to take the CAD trade leading into the NFP? I got 338 pips off of that one, and that's with two of my three units getting stopped out! Dial

--- 帖子 #315 ---
No harm taken! We just don't have a solid foundation on this new style that vegas has released to us. It almost seems to easy if we were to take the calculation of momentum out. So IMO I believe that message in the email is an addition. He should be releasing and updated version soon.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I too am waiting anxiously for vegas's new method. Until then I've decided not to use the 24/28 MAs in my trading. I am, however using the weekly momentum indicator given by iso AND I've modified the same indicator to show daily momentum on the same MA's (5 and 21). Changing the time period on Iso's "tun_macd" indicator from 10080 to 1440 gives the daily 5/21. You can also use his indicator and show different MAs if you wish. It's still a work in progress, but I'm working on a system where the weekly and daily momentums have to be going the same way before I take a trade. This, limits the number of trades significantly, but I think it will give good results (hopefull).

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Now that sounds Great! Keep us posted as to your progress. Did you grab some pips in last weeks dollar bear fiesta? HJ

Great Point Alan! It does allow for a pretty methodical scaling for exits tho. Would you agree? HJ

Thanx for the encouragement Dial! I spent this morning looking back at the Loonie last week. That momentum change snuck up on me! Killer catch tho! UDAMAN! When I marked up a a 4hr chart on my Interbank system and applied what I've picked up from you, I only come up with a measley 220 pips. Also the trade never hits the D144 yet you imply that only 2 of your positions were stopped out. Did you Take profit at the D89 fib level ? Maybe you could chart the anatomy of this trade for us ....with all that free time you have now that the PF is open. Honestly, I don't see how you have any time left at all. So these posts are very appreciated by me! BTW- I saw the link for the new payment method for the PF so I hope to join this weekend. Paypal was holding me up.....on my end. Anywho! Heres a chart on your momentum change catch on the loonie (Kudos) I'll post my Hourly Next HJ

Gentlemen after getting a good days nap I woke up to the labtop next to my bed and decided to do a little more research into this, analyzing the 4hr method final. I redid all my charts considering I had many personal alterations. I have deleted most of them. Then I reread the file, very carefully. I can almost sing it now, for its about the 100th time. This is what I have for a few members here that were confused. Trade closed bars only! Thats the first thing, answered my own question. Firehorse, this ones for you. The reason you have trouble achieveing the same gains as Vegas states in his spreadsheet is because he uses the close of the 4hr 8 SMA and not the price of the bar! Its very confusing, and you must read it carefully to finally comprehend the pricing. It wasn't written in bold letters, and took me many times to finally catch it till now. Having that said, gains can be much much different then stated. Also, in regards to the email the vegas sent to one of the fellow memebers. In there, it stated respectively. I know we analyzed it well before but it finally clicks to me, that the 24/28 EMA's on the daily are there to eliminate the lag and the ones on the weekly are there just as an addition and confirmation to the trend. But the main point is that the daily gets rid of the 1 week lag. I feel I am onto something here. Hope everyone has a good weekend. -S Power.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi S Power Thanks for pointing that out. It's something I noticed but didn't pay too much attention to as I thought trying to do it more accurately would easily make it more profitable. From the Vegas document If using the 8SMA line to calcuate the profit 'reduces' the profit, then I 'assumed' that calculating the 'close price/exit at limit' as accurately as possible would result in an 'increase' profits and proving the system was profitable would be a breeze! However, at the moment, I cannot show to myself that this is the case, and if I am going to be trading it mechanically as per the rules, I cannot prove to my satisfaction that I will be able to achieve anywhere near the profit levels as stated in the document. I would be grateful if there is anyone who is able to list out the trades that prove that if the system traded as per the vegas document rules would be able to achieve close to the results as presented. I've tried but have not been able to do this. I have posted my spreadsheet of trades above for anyone who has the inclination to find mistakes in my calculations. Best regards Alan

I've been off the ball with this system lately but I was thinking about it today (Uh-oh!) and wondered...can it be done differently..? I'm considering modelling it on the triple screen system (see an example here ) and just using momentum studies for weekly, daily &amp; 4h. So for example if the weekly is up, screen for daily dips that look to turn up on the 4h. You still need a handle on momentum changes that give false signals. Throw in some discretion and...hey presto!...you have another tunnel system. (I was thinking of calling it "Mojo". ) You could use the indicators to highlight exit points instead of fib lines. I could use a consistent set of ma's across all tf's for the indies. Right now the current (Vegas) system has different ma's across different tf's and you need to do different stuff on different timeframes. Too clumsy for my liking. Until Vegas gets back with his new document and also me finishing reading all of Dial's stuff I won't be discarding anything yet. But this might be another interesting spin. Some of my postings here demonstrate how it could work. Anybody up for some investigation???

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Oh yeah Huh? Never Mind! I just spent several long nights studying the wrong lines applied to my charts, It took Dial to ping me and call me on it! I now have the notorious distinction of posting a few Tunnel Analysis Charts in Bonehead Fashion! If I could I'd delete those posts as they have no value to this discussion.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Firehorse, I just did some backtesting on the EURUSD and found my signals relative to Vegas's about a week off (not aligned) but I gotta say his model generated me 342 pips with not one loosing trade. I only did a very small period backtesting in Jan and Feb. This is how you read my spreadsheet: On the left in the Weekly column, I posted the range of dates where the pips were rising. Second column, I posted the 24/28 EMA Daily dates when they were in compliance with the signal generated by the weekly, in other words a bull run. Third column, I posted the actual 4hr trades and made sure they were in agreement with the daily. So as you can see, I have incorperated the '24/28 EMA's respectively' into the model which helped get rid of the 1 week lag. I cannot emphasize how helpful that is. I only backtested this small period due to the fact that I have been programing my MT for a while and am not used to the system... and also that I am hungover from yesterday LOL. Also note, I didn't include fibs in this backtesting. I also didn't put the dates for the trades but look within the periods given and you will see where I entered. Tell me what you think. -S Power

As there seems to be some confusion about the difference between primary and secondary entries, I've made up the graph below as an aid to understanding. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I like that. It gives a more clear explanation. However, that and fibs are the 2 things that I have no incorporated into my trading. I feel the units should be you choice of risk. But I think vegas ment the units to be a way of quickly summing up risk management, implying that trades entered above or below the 55 (1.5 unit trades) are more risky and you should put less at stake due to that fact.

Where did everybody go ? Has this thread moved to somewhere else ? I am quite new to Forex but was trading Futures for a few years. Since I live in europe the Forex hours are quite handy. Someone dropped the 1-hour Vegas method in my mailbox. It took only a few hours to see the beauty of that beast. Beauty because of the simplicity and beast because of the chop around the tunnel as you all know of course. Someone mentioned the 4-hour method and I started to search the web for more informations. Found not many infos BUT the most valuable --&gt; this forum Best wishes to all Tom

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hello Tom! As to where everybody went.... I don't know. I've been traveling for the last week or so! As you are probably aware the Fellow who penned the "tunnel" documents goes by the net handle "Vegas". If you have not read his 4Hr tunnel doc it is attached to the first post of this thread. In that doc, as in the 1hr doc Vegas expresses that his tunnel methods are only models and are open to anyone to make what they will out of them. There are two reasons I suspect that traffic has slowed a bit on this forum. but it is not because the 4hr Tunnel has been diminished in any way. In my opinion it is better than ever! 1. "Dialist" who posts in this thread often has developed the 4hrtunnel "model" into a very powerful "system" he calls "The Knife" Several of the old Tunnel purists have migrated towards his section of the Private forum. (See "James 16 Group" in preffered services of this forum) Still if you decide to check out the 4hr Tunnel and have questions Dial or someone else will try to get you an answer. Vegas himself has been known to stop by! 2. Vegas has just released a new document "Vegas Wealth Builder" I believe it is called and those of us whom have a great deal of respect for Vegas have been engaged in a discussion about the impact of that writing. Thats all for now. HJ

HeavyJ and Diallist thanks for pointing me in the right direction (thread). It´s good to know that this forum didn´t give up on the methods Vegas has kindly shared with us. I already visited the VegasWealthBuilder thread and downloaded the manual and all the available MT4 indis. Oh boy, so much valuable material but as a non native speaker AND slow learner ... my eyes are burning already Diallist would you be so kind and send me an email about your private group and some hints about "The Knife"? One more thing: Having found this forum was a relief at least. There are many Forex forums out there and I am sure it would be a mistake not searching for informations but the attitude, the overall tone and the way how people easily stumble from fight to fight and get distracted in those communities left me more than once behind with my mouth wide open.

Trade starting on 20/1/04, I got 218pips versus your 136. From then on, all my trades were short because the weekly momentum had turned down so I'm puzzled about your remaining two long trades, which had no dates next to them so I could not be certain about matching them with anything. I've attached a chart with arrows showing the backtested trades. From my perspective, the 5 trades in the spreadsheet does not prove a consistent trading system. I've manually forward tested a system over a month clocking about 100 trades over 8 currencies which had really great results, only for it to bomb in month 2 and 3. So for me, any system with test results with less than 100 trades has still to prove itself. Otherwise, in my mind, I would be gambling, because I would be making trades on a system without a positive expectation. Please let me know if you spot any errors in my figures. In the figures above I have not accounted for partial entry if secondary trades enters above one of the fib levels. In those cases, I assume that the partial lot has already been closed out as profit so no partial lot is entered for that particular fib target which has already passed. I also have not put in limit exit for the partial fib levels which will also give a different pip result. If you have more accurate figures as a comparison than I will do a more accurate backtest.

Anybody have tried tunneling with other indicators like ichamuko? I think that can work like a filter and take more certain profits.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
After strudying Vegas Tunnel systems for several Months now I have seen the addition of about any indicator or combo thereof to try and tweak results favorable. I am not knocking on these folks, but I dont see the indicators helping any more than what the tunnel is telling you. I have become some what of a tunnel purist! I believe that the probablilities presented by the tunnel, propper money management, And price action, at critical levels, as taught by james16 gives you the maximum edge. I must admit I don't know a whit about ichamuko however. Maybe you could post a chart and show how it improves profitability, longterm. Anyway I hope you do well with your indicators and if you think they give you an edge.......then by all means..... HeavyJ

I must also agree. 8/55 mas combined with price action was good enough for me in the past and still is. Proper money management and SLs is another story. A friend of mine likes it cluttered with dozens of indicators. Unless 20 of them don't 'line up' he won't trade and that's fine. I prefer KISS however.

http://buymeridia.info/images/ichamuko.jpg http://buymeridia.info/images/ichamuku.jpg The most important thing that you have to watch is the clound. You should not do anything (open short or long positions) when the price is in the clound. You can compare the current result with "traditional" vegas method - 5 and 21 moving averanges. As you can see the 21 EMA is downward slope and 5 SMA is touching 21 EMA. http://buymeridia.info/images/eurusdweekly.jpg The information about ichimoku is given HERE and HERE I was interested in this indicator when I was searching for japanese methods of trading. In Japan it is very popular method of trading.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanx for posting the Chart! Could you post it again someone spilled coffee on the first one! Only joking! OK now if I get this straight you Said: But the weekly prices are in the cloud for only a 10 week period. And another 2 week period over a three year period! If the cloud is to Protect you from bad trades, surely there would be more instances in this 3 year period. I did my best on this! The chart below shows a portion of the trades that the "cloud" would keep you out of in the "10 week cloud cover". I don't think I need protection like that.......Maybe an umbrella NOTE: The Vertical Bars are as follows: Green= Bullish Momentum Trend Red = Beraish Momentum Trend Now I am sure that in Japan and indeed many other regions that this indicator is the cornerstone of some very profitable systems. It comes down to what makes you confident. As for me, All I need is the Vegas systems, Meaty discussions with system developers Like Diallist, Black Dots, Weekly Momentum, 55ma, 8sma hook, extreme fib levels, risk/money management plan, horseshoe, rabbits foot, my lucky toaster, and my blankie....... Good trading all HeavyJ

Firehorse, I remember reading your post somewhere and I cant find it now but I know it was in referance to my backtest... Please read below why we most likely got different results For the backtesters, please read When you calculate momentum on the weekly, there is a common thing I believe most of us have failed to realize. When we calculate the momentum, we use it in prediction for the upcoming week....I believe many have made the same mistake I made. We calculate the momentum and when we turn to the 4hr chart we initiate trades on the week we calculated it for, not on the week ahead. Please take this into consideration. Im eager to hear comments.

Hi S Power My reply is here Basically for the 5 trades you calculated, I was actually able to calculate a higher pip return "218pips versus your 136" From my calculations, I had a secondary trade where you took it as a primary. Also one of your trades was split into two in my calculations because with my data, the 8SMA turned down and back up again. If you could provide dates for your two unknown trades I can re-run the program again. I did a 'predictive' with the weekly momentum because that was the only way I could begin to match the results I was getting from the eurusd in the first few periods of the original 4hr vegas document. If I did properly by lagging, I could not explain the results of the first few periods in the eurusd and I didn't change it as a comparison against your figures. It would be great if you could also have a time against trade entry and exit so that I could match the 'bar' time with you as well. Also, 5 trades doesn't logically make it a profitable system. I've had profitable results for a hundred trades and then have the system bomb. I was hoping to run the 4hr tunnel rules mechanically against data and have it coming out being much more profitable than stated as the original document said it gave the less profitable result. Unfortunately, my backtest results showed that I could not duplicate the results. I'm still trying to see if it is my misunderstanding. So if are able to run through eurusd of the 4hr document and come up with more profitable results than the pessimistic ones they give then I would be really pleased to see where I have gone wrong in my backtesting. Best regards Alan

It looks like Vegas has posted the "official" Vegas Daily Document. Interesting read. Seems to clear up some of the questions from his post in this thread. http://www.freewebs.com/mswilson/ Has anyone gotten results from this variation yet? Is the Daily method being taught in the PF?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Doing some reseach earlier this month some backtesting gurus "called" me on a mistake that I had made in my calcs. While I was somewhat embarrassed, they all suggested the mistake may still have some value. .........so I plotted it on my weekly. Here is an example of the product of the bonehead art. (This is germaine to the V4T)

To anyone, What and where is PF? Thanx

Hi pippie, The PF or Private Forum is a subscription based trading education service. It's formal name is The James16 Group. For more information go to www.james16group.com or click on the link in my signature. Thanks for your interest. Dial

Why not discuss particular situations here? Thanks

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hey Pippie, I'm up for it! You got some particular situations to discuss? (regarding the 4hr tunnel?) HJ

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Thanks Heavy, Am I wrong in assumming that Vegas no longer uses the Weekly MAs? This is what I read from below. Also, Do you know much about the KNIFE system. Does it really improve on the 4hr tunnel? With the 4 hour tunnel method, I am inclined to use ‘The Vegas Currency Daily’ black dots as guideposts for determining whether to be long or short from the signals. The difference in the values of the weekly MA’s [moving averages] in determining long or short can often lag the market quite dramatically. If the black dots are above the daily tunnel, initiate short positions when you get the 4 hour signal, and if the black dots are below the daily tunnel, initiate long positions when you get the 4 hour signal.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Howdy Pippie. The short answer is. I don't know what Vegas does beyond what you have pointed out. As for me in a nut shell, I do not discount the weekly ma. I believe through rather vigorous study, That both the VWB and 4hr methods can work together in concert. Sometimes aiding, sometimes opposing each other. My original treatise , and helpful comments from others are here if you would like to understand more. I sent a synopsys of ths to Vegas who said I was correct in my assumption. VWB Chapter 3 Study The actual changes to the 4 hr vegas model are slight in the Knife. What is different in the Knife is Dials complete understanding of this model and his uncanny ability to communicate the model as a "system". In my view this is a big difference and improvement. Dial has modified the system somewhat with the advent of VWB I believe, and while I am a PF member, I must admit I am not totally up to speed with all changes. But I do know that Dial does not go off willy nilly with changes to his system so I imagine they are quite good! Hope this helps HeavyJ

HJ, would you use the 5SMA or the 5EMA to determine the current trend right now on the USD/YEN with the 5SMA its still in a downtrend, but using the EMA its in an uptrend already. was short the usd/yen and got stopped out at BE, then i decided to take a look at the 5EMA and it could be a secondary long setup instead. I might not trade at all though, seen price seems to be forming a triangle and it might just break out in either direction. What are your thoughts on this

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hey Jotty, I haven't been following this pair lately but I just took a quick look. The ema is more powerful, or seems to be at the close when it prints for the week. because it's based on the close it tends to bob up and down on the current bar. Japan news was not so good as was expected. If I were trading this pair I would be inclined to look for another 8ma hook Long. Would be nice to have a new weekly High though Be careful---Nonfarms out tomorrow! HJ

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hello, I am a new member of this forum. Based on the previous quote from the 4-Hour Momentum Tunnel Strategy, Can anyone please explain how do you measure the difference in pips between the two Moving Averages? Is it an approximation or is there an exact way to measure it? Thanks, any help would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Pip maker, Maybe Dial will come by and answer. His explainations are better than mine! Here is a sloppy chart that shows how I do it in MT4. If you don't use MT4 maybe you will still get the gist! Good journey. HJ

Hi everyone, This is a great forum, and I appreciate all the knowledge that is posted here! I have been studying the 4 Hour Tunnel for about 6 months now, and I am having trouble figuring out how to read the Weekly chart, to determine whether to take long or short positions for any particular week. I seem to have trouble interpreting what Vegas meant in his explanation in the 4-Hour Document. I have scanned thru this thread, but I have not found anything that clears up my confusion. I would like to email Vegas about this, but I am sure he is busy and do not want to bother him!! Is there any way some one could re-explain this to me? Thanks in advance!! Christian

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Wow, I posted all of that, and didnt even see the previous post explaining the weekly MA!!!! -Christian

--- 帖子 #362 ---
So, based on what I gathered from that post...we would currently be looking to LONG the market, any time this week, when when we get the signal...am I correct about this? -Christian

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Howdy, I just finished reading the original Vegas 4-hr tunnel doc and have set up my MT4 indicator. I think Vegas has come up with a very solid model here, but have some questions that I was hoping you guys could help me out with: 1) I understand the relevance of using the 21 EMA and 5 SMA to determine the weekly trend direction before taking any position. Nevertheless, as you can see in the chart I attached, the weekly trend for USD/CHF is DOWN but the price action is looking more bullish, the 8 SMA is no longer negative, the MACD is showing more bullish sentiment, etc. By waiting until the weekly trend is UP before I can take a position LONG, aren't we missing out on some very good pips given that the 8 SMA has to eventually cross back over the 55 SMA? I have noticed several cases in many charts where the weekly trend would have shown DOWN yet the price climbed back up to the 55 SMA rather quickly (and gained some fat pips on the way). Any comments from those who have been using this system a while? 2) Do you all see ANY currency pairs that are ready/near-ready to trade today using the 4 hour tunnel? I am looking at USD/CHF, EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, USD/CAD, GBP/USD, and AUD/USD and every single one of them has a weekly trend signal that is in conflict with a current entry based on the 8 SMA, thus making it impossible to initiate a trade until these two signals coordinate. Perhaps what I am looking for is just some confirmation that I am interpreting this model correctly. It would seem that, by waiting until both the weekly and 4-hour price trends are in concert, you have a bit of a waiting game... Is this your experience? Thanks, Ian

Folks, I'm new to Forex Factory (and FX in general) and just have a really dumb question. What is the "PF" several member mention below? Cheers, Andy

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hi Andy, I'm a newbie as well, but I know the "PF" people refer to in this thread is one of several private forums dedicated to proprietary outgrowths of the original Vegas Wealth Builder method. You have to pay a monthly fee for access to these forums, which is good in the sense that you have a commitment from the moderator/host that they will respond to all your questions, post their trading recommendations, etc. The downside is that those of us still in the "open source" side (e.g.: 'free') may end up waiting quite a while for replies to our postings... If you're interested in joining one of these PFs, I believe "Diallist" (you can find his posts in this thread) has one dedicated to the "Knife" method. Happy trading, Ian

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi guys, To avoid any misinformation.. Please visit this site to get more info. You really don't need to join the PF if you don't want.. http://www.james16group.com/More_Information.html But please don't say that because there's a private forum the quality of posts here are not the same.. Well maybe, that's what I'm getting from what you're saying.. You also don't have any idea what's in there so I really do think it's better for you not to say anything from what you think is in there.. The people in these forum are friendly.. Just be reminded that we also have lives of our own.. I for myself reply as much as my knowledge and time allows.. I'm sure there are others as well.. But anyway, I think I'm talking too much now.. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #367 ---
East, No offense was meant by my post. I fully understand that everyone has lives on these forums and do not expect immediate replies to my posts. Frankly, I'm just happy forums like this exist in the first place where the spirit of mutual learning about Forex can be cultivated and nurtured. No, I'm not part of the private forum, but I still cannot see how anything I said about it could be construed as negative, misinforming or otherwise pejorative, so I'm quizzical about your aggressive rebuttal ("You also don't have any idea what's in there so I really do think it's better for you not to say anything from what you think is in there..) to my post. I do think there is a relationship between how much this thread has slowed down and the creation of the PF, but that is just an observation, not a judgement. Anyway, I wish you and the rest who are part of the PF the very best success. I'm sure that Diallist and the others who have set these up offer a great deal of value for the $99/month they charge. I may end up even joining in the end, but first want to absorb what I can from the open forums. - Ian

Sorry Ian.. Well, I guess it was some pent up emotions in me... Sorry for putting it on my reply to your post.. Please accept my apologies.. Regards, East

First, let me start by thanking Vegas and his efforts to help less experienced traders. The Vegas systems have changed the way I look at the fx market and after a year of searching I think I've finally found a strategy that fits. If I am as successful as I now think I can be (previously it was just "hope") I owe it to Vegas for pointing me in the right direction. Thank you sir. Now then, the PF. I am not a member of the PF. When I first found FF, I might have believed what you said about the quality of postings in here. In the vast majority of instances you are correct. I really appreciate the time people take to share and build each other up. I hope to be able to contribute likewise in the future. However, I think there are some realities with the "private forum" that we should all keep in mind when interacting with those in the PF. Unfortunately because the private forum is private, by definition they withhold information, or else it wouldn't be private. Why then would the PF "Team" (reference from the PF website) bother to hang out on this forum if their site is superior enough to require $99/mo to enter? At least one of the reasons they are here is to advertize their service (which in my mind creates an affiliation with this site). That leads to some realities for us "non-PFers." When you or I reach out and help someone we are doing it for whatever reason(s) we have. The PF Team is no different. It's up to you to judge when information that is shared is of upmost quality or pared back a bit to tease. No animosity here - I've got no problem with guys trying to make a buck. Hey, that's what we're all trying to do right? It's just necessary to understand where people are coming from. The way I see it, you get good information here on the Vegas systems, just not the best information. You need to pay for that. I don't think I'm offbase here. But if anybody disagrees, hey, dismiss it - these 2 cents were free.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I happen to agree with you Ian. If a question is asked on this forum, it should be answered on this forum. Not sent to a private forum that one has to pay for. Dial, I think is the admin of this forum and therefore should not be touting a private forum. The whole idea doesn't set right with me. pippie

When (lately) was there anything of real substance stated on this thread ? So far I have had two very successful trades using VWB (demoed but successful.) If I can find the time I will put together the step by step process, with charts thoughts and fears, I took. Regarding the PF, If they are so successful at trading, why do they charge for information. Payment, for info or modification of the VWB is not, I don't believe, what Vegas intended. I think it is great a sucessful person , such as vegas, truely tries to help someone struggling as most of us are. pippie

It is a sad fact that most advice is worth what you paid for it. Not being a smart ass just being honest. I signed up for the PF before it even opened its doors due to the quality of the knowledge I knew would be shared there. Diallist does share his knowledge of a system he refferes to as Knife that is based on the 4-hour tunnel. Jim teaches about 'price action' and how to read a chart, but the absolute best part is the part you will read very little about here because there is no interest. There is this guy that goes by the handle of FijiTrader. He teaches on the day to day stuff that is going to make you a success at this business. He is the reason I continue as a member of the PF and will probably be for the rest of the year. I wont go into his stuff cause it does not involve system entries or exits so unfortunetly it draws very little interest, which is probably why little of substance is found on these matters in this or any forum. I have no doubt I am a better trader now in all facets than I was when I signed up.

Vegas has released 4 docs in total. The 1-hour tunnel, The 4-Hour tunnel, Vegas Wealth Builder 1 (VWB1) and Vegas Wealth Builder II (VWBII). In the VWB series )which should be read a asingle document as in fact it is) he introduced the Vegas Daily. So now there are 3 'methods'. Vegas stresses that these are methods and not 'systems'. In VWB docs the weekly is now replaced by the daily for trade direction. Vegas referes to it as 'black dots'. Basically he is saying 'look at the chart and if price is moving away from a high toward the daily tunnel then a 'short' trade is looked for on the 1 and 4 hour. and vice versa. Numerous examples are given on these 'black dots' on the VWBI doc. Your post is dated from the 20th so u may have figured this out already

yea, spelling as well. I typed in the name of the mortgage company I worked for. The broker wanted to be at the top of the list so he added an extra A to it. I was thinking about that office when I typed it. To many pages for a highschool student and 99% wouldn't get it or care. Most adults don't get it or agree with it. For some reason people think they have an automatic entitlement. When a gift is given...take it be happy and prosper. But people shouldn't expect everything for free. To many people expect things. Wellfare, hand outs, etc. What ever happended to an honest days work = an honest day wage. They day has gone with the people who busted their ass building the greatest nation on earth. Some may disagree but when you can carry the constitution in your pocket; a document that changed the course of history of the world that is powerful. Anyway, Now I am rambling....

--- 帖子 #379 ---
That just makes no sense. The Vegas system was free. The discussion on the FF is free. All my forex knowledge to date has been free. You can find almost any custom indicator you need for MT4 for free. Guys over on Forex TSD will even code things for you if you ask nicely. I completely disagree, and I don't think I'm alone (isn't that right pippie?). Paying for anything doesn't guarantee its quality; the same is true in reverse. FYI, money management and position sizing is not an industry secret you can only get on pay sites. I agree with you, though, it is not discussed nearly enough despite the effect it can have on your account. BTW, I've got no beef with the PF or anyone in it. I was just making an observation.

I've seen quite a few recent queries in this thread related to determining the change in trend using the weekly chart. This, and the following two posts are excerpted from the complete Knife tutorial. I hope you find these useful. Be warned however that the lagging nature of the weekly momentum indicator can result in severe losses during trend changes. Pay attention to price action during these times. See the James16 Chart Thread for more information on using pure price action. Trend Change - UP to DOWN The following image illustrates how a trend change from UP to DOWN is signalled. I have marked three bars with pairs of colored dots placed on the moving averages. Study the image below and you will see that the strength of each bar is determined by subtracting the lower moving average (21 EMA) from the upper moving average (5 SMA). In the image below, the momentum of the "green" and "yellow" bars increases from 143 to 144 indicating a continuation of the current UP trend. However, the momentum of the "yellow" and "red" bars decreases from 144 to 134. This decrease signals a trend change from UP to DOWN.

An Increase OR Decrease in Momentum Indicates a Trend Change Most of the time, a trend change will be indicated by a decrease in momentum. However on some occasions, an increase in momentum will indicate a trend change. Regardless of whether an increase or a decrease of momentum indicates a trend change, you should start taking positions in the direction of the new trend immediately. You do not wait until crossover occurs. Sometimes, you don't get a crossover between trend changes. And, while most trend changes are indicated by a decrease in momentum, there are some occasions where the trend change is marked by an increase in momentum. Here are the two sequences that mark a trend change. The first is when a decrease in momentum marks the trend change, and is the one you'll see most of the time. The second sequence occurs less frequently and is characterized by an increase in momentum marking the trend change. First Trend Change Sequence 1. Momentum continues to increase from week to week indicating the current trend is still in place. 2. Momentum decreases from one week to the next indicating a trend change has occurred. 3. Momentum continues to decrease until a crossover of the 21 EMA and 5 SMA occur. 4. Crossover Occurs 5. Momentum begins to increase following the crossover. 6. The next decrease in momentum marks another trend change. Second Trend Change Sequence 1. Momentum continues to increase from week to week indicating the current trend is still in place. 2. Momentum decreases from one week to the next indicating a trend change has occurred. 3. Momentum continues to decrease, but then ..... 4. No Crossover Occurs. 5. Instead, momentum begins to increase again marking the beginning of a new trend. 6. The next decrease in momentum marks another trend change. In summary, a change in momentum always indicates a change in trend, however a crossover does not always occur between trend changes. The image below will help illustrate a trend change without a crossover. Please pay special attention to the red bars. These are all bearish bars with lower highs and lower lows indicating the trend is in the downward direction. Please note that the price action of these bars PRECEEDS the trend change as indicated by the increase in momentum. This is why the Vegas Team said that the model is vulnerable to losses during trend change. Use of discretion is advised. If the price action strongly indicates a trend opposite that indicated by momentum, you may wish to either stay out of the market, or to trade against the momentum trend and with the price action trend. If in doubt, stay out!

Pretty good observations. But if you think or believe something will greatly benefit you but it's not free, are you not willing to pay for it? Not everything in life is free. If you want it free, you have to sift through all the noise. I think you've also observed this since you've got all your knowledge for free. I also believe you can be able to get the info you need for free in the net today. But if you believe you've found something worth paying for, will you not pay for it? I know that there are those who cannot afford most specially on the 3rd world countries like mine. I'm just blessed that I'm earning and saving and able to spare some money in order for me to invest in me. I also have on the back of my psych of not always receiving. I need to give something back because if I don't, something's not in balance. I've been receiving too much from the guys here and I really wanted to give something back. Not just to them but to the FF community as a whole. Also, please do remember that VWB 3 is also not free. And in the info file from him, he also indicated why he charges the document. You're observations are welcome and the way you delivered it is respectful. As long as it's delivered in that way, I think discussions will push through smoothly (in my opinion that is).

It is unfortunate that some members feel disenfranchised. I am a little confused though. Why should any education in any field be free? I started out in the public forum and received outstanding advise and guidance. The information in the thread by HeavyJ about his trading style is spot on prefect. I have never read a better description of Dow theory than the thread MuddBuddha posted. The description of the trading method used by 777 is second to none. (that was commented on by the author as recently as today). Of course the Vegas files are without compare at any price. I could go on and on, but this is not the place for an epic. If you are not comfortable with the information discussed here that is truly unfortunate. However the fault cannot fall on the collective members of the public forum who have given so much. I recently realized that there was information I needed from FIGI trader about money management and mind set That I have paid much more in the past to attempt to acquire. This information is copyrighted by Figi. It is his own intellectual property and he has every right to charge for it. This forum is any thing but thin on useful content. From my experience, judging by all the Private messages I get from people wanting to learn, It is maybe too content rich to be competely understood by a newcomer. I have only been associated with this forum for a short time, but I have never seen one that stands in compare. I have certainly done my best to help anyone who has asked me and I am a member of both forums. What I will not do is disclose proprietary and copyrighted material. That should rightfully be paid for. I do not base my ability to help on whether or not someone is a member of the private forum. Now gosh it sure would be great to get back to talking about the Vegas system... SMJ Originally Posted by Fryes God, I wish I had a dollar for every time I've had to endure that asinine statement!

Just one more thing. The instructors spend allot of time helping us in the PF as well as answering questions of FF members not signed up for the PF. Personally I feel better paying them for their time as I don't feel right about asking people to work for free. IMO they could be spending allot more time trading and making money for themselves but they decided to help us instead. Thanks for everything you guys do!!!! Joe Ok back to the Tunnel.

Back to the Vegas system ... AUDJPY, USDCAD, and EURAUD all look like good candidates. I'm long USDCAD from 1.1464, and short EURAUD from 1.6682 (too early entry), and 1.6591. Also shorted AUDUSD at 0.7332

--- 帖子 #393 ---
EZ, I'm new to this Forum (which BTW is the most informative I've seen yet) and I'm wondering what your targets for the USD/CAD and AUD/USD are and which method, VWB or other, you used to initiate the trade decision.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
EZ: I am looking at setup for the USD/CAD and AUD/USD. I was wondering what led u to begin so early. I am using the Vegas Daily method for trend determination and at the moment the trend is Up for AUDUSD and Down for USDCAD. They are approaching the daily outer FIBS but do not look as if they have begun to turn yet. The 4-hour charts do show them at their outer FIBs but again doesn't seem to be turning yet. Weekly Trend determination is lagging so I base the final trend determination on a combo of the weekly and daily.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Could you please explain the criteria for all of your entries?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Basically, I did looked at the momentum on the 4 hr charts, and saw a divergence. This was confirmed on hourly charts, and on 15 min charts. I think my USDCAD entry is pretty solid ... 1.14 is good support. The EURAUD was a bit early, but I think it will work out. I don't have any targets ... usually once a trend starts, I use a trailing stop, and add more positions as the trade goes my way, then exit if stopped out on trailing stop, or when I see multiple divergences on multiple timeframes, which would likely confirm a trend change.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
As you describe it, that sounds really interesting. I quick question, what are you comparing to determine divergence and also to determine momentum... I have been using Daily DOC 10 for the trend and momentum of the 4 hour, because of the tight range of gbpusd which I have been following. Thanks SMJ

--- 帖子 #398 ---
To determine momentum, I am just using a momentum indicator with a 8 period lookback on the 4 hr chart. For instance, looking at USDCAD, price made a lower low, but MOMENTUM made a higher high just recently. Also, USDCAD is at the -144 fib. This would clue me in for a possible reversal. At that point, I would look at the 1 hr chart, and look for + divergences using my candlecode indicator (look it up on Google) which also indicates a buy signal. I would also use this indicator on the 15 minute chart to confirm positive divergences, and also to fine-tune entries. Once the position is moving up, and the 4 hour chart momentum is over 100, I would add to the position on pullbacks. I prefer to add on 1 hr chart buy signals, but may add on 15 min signals. I would also use a trailing stop, and get out when (1) trailing stop is hit, or (2) I see a sell signal opposite of described above for the buy signal. For the Vegas system, he enters the trade with all 3 units at once, and takes them off at fib levels, etc. I prefer to enter 1 unit with a stop ... if it goes against me, I'm stopped out on just 1 unit. If it goes my way, I would add (once its up 70 to 100 pips or so), and add on pullbacks. Ideally, it would go like this: buy 1 position once up 70 to 100 pips, move stop to break even add 1 or 2 positions on a pullback (buy signal on 1 hr or 15 min chart) use a trailing stop if very aggressive, add 1 or 2 more positons on pullbacks, as price moves up 100 pips exit on very strong negative divergences on 1 hr chart, or when trailing stop hit. Hope this helps ... EZCurrency

That sounds like a great idea . I like the scaling approach. It just makes sense when one takes the bits of several methods and combines them with their own approach and makes it their own. An up front and personal method that you understand inside and out. Great idea... I have heard of candlecode, but I am certainly going to do more research on it... thanks for your clear answer...

Out half of AUDUSD at 0.7270 (+63 pips). Stops to B/E on other half. I exited early because I am too heavily in AUD imo ... wanted to lighten up a bit. Looks like AUD is starting to fall off against all currencies. limit order got filled in EURCHF buy at 1.57 Also bought EURGBP at .6923 still holding USDCAD long from 1.1464, and EURAUD from 1.6682, 1.6591, and some AUDJPY from all over (a bit under water on those)

Out USDCAD 1.1464 at 1.1518 ... stop at B/E at 1.1503 position. Not so sure about price action here ... Short GBPJPY at 207.76. It is at weekly downtrend line, and also at 144 fib, and showing a negative momentum divergence on the 4 hr chart. Could spike to 208.5 ... stop is above that.

How does one join the PF and get more info on the newest updating on tunnel trading? floridasand

--- 帖子 #405 ---
All that is known about tunnel trading is in the public forums. However, there are a few other methods discussed and explained in the private forum (Knife, Price action, PIN, and of course PAP). To find more info and to join, go to www.james16group.com Thanks SMJ

ez, how's the tunnel strategy working for you?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
In the knife system, the fib levels are talked about 89,144,233,377. To my understanding, those numbers are pips asay from 55 sma. My question is, how are those lines put on my charts?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
It depends on what charting software you are using. It would have to be programmed in. If you are using MT4 that has already been done in both the Vegas Docs and the FF tunnel mlq file in the sticky in the Beginner Forum... Hope that helps, Scott ps, I just noticed you mentioned the 55ma so you are using the 4hour method. check out the FF Tunnel chart in the beginner vegas docs post#2

--- 帖子 #409 ---
smjones, I found the file you are talking about. Also, I am using MT4. I don not know how to manually program it. Is there somewhere I can learn to do that. I mean, do I do it in the expert advisor or some custom indicator? I am not sure what to do. Man I feel dumb. I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Here is another way to ask to maybe be a little more clear. Can I just save that and then on my mt4, open it on a chart? Or do I need to program that into the platform? It seems like I should just be able to save it and use it. I make things more complicated than they are some times.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Oh yea, I guess that would help. here goes... Close MT4 ( if it is open) Download the FF file Copy that file to the following folder... if you are using Stratbuilder, Program Files/strategeybuilder/experts/indicators If you are using IBFX, Program Files/IBFX/experts/indicators If you are using Metatrador from any where else, Program Files/Metatrader/experts/indicators Open MT4, click on Insert (at the top), place the curser on Indicator, then Custom, then FF Tunnel Chart then click. This will add this indicator to your chart... As far as using MT4 It has a help menu to learn it's various functions... this is a good site to learn how to use MT4 http://www.strategybuilderfx.com/sfxmanual/ thanks scott

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I went to insert then indicators then custom and FF tunnel chart is not there. Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Did you close MT4 before you copied the file? if not close it now and then reopen MT4, so the program can find all the indicators in the folder... thanks scott

I have backtested this over some different pairs. I'm not getting anything close to the amount of pips that everyone is seeing... Here's what I see May/June 2005 (bold marks the big signal cross that Vegas spoke about.. the rest are just slope changes): May 1.2802 1.264 Short 162 1.2592 1.2617 Short -25 1.2628 1.2576 Short 52 1.2525 1.2584 Short -50 1.2474 1.2278 Short 196 June 1.2217 1.2263 S hort -46 1.228 1.2146 Short 134 1.2042 1.2102 Short -50 1.2155 1.2179 Short -24 1.212 1.2082 Short 38 1.2104 1.2076 Short 28 I have been thinking about the change in momentum lately which from what I read on this thread, is pretty much what I think the knife system is...

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Can someone explain to me what the levels equate to for the fib levels that Vegas talks about? I.e. What does 144, 233, etc, etc equate to? All the fib tools I see are like 38.2, 61.8, etc etc... Sorry, I'm just starting to incorporate fibs into my trading...

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Mr Trend, The fib levels vegas is referring to are not available in any trading platform. It is something he came up with as profit take levels. (and the indicator he provided with the docs automatically calculates that for you in MT4. I think Claude or Bemac created the same indicator for VT). Since 144, 233, etc. are numbers in the fibonnaci sequence (where you add the current number with the previous one to get the next number in the sequence), they are the number of pips from the base point which is the 28 EMA (or is it 24? not sure, please check the vegas docs which one ). So for example, the current value of the 28 EMA is 116.00 for the yen, the 144 fib level would then be 144 pips from that value which is: 116.00 + 144 pips = 117.44 The same thing goes for other fib levels. I'd like to provide you with a chart to make it clearer but time does not allow me right now. I'm also not sure if there's a chart already in this thread. You may want to look for it here. Anyway, I hope this somehow helps. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi, I also wasn't able to attach a chart, so I will explain the easiest way I do this; Open EUR/USD H1 chart. The recent high was at 1.2974, right? Here comes the Fibo natural sequence (89. 144, 233 for Euro): from 1.2974 subtract 0.0089 and mark a line on that level (1.2885), then from 1.2974 subtract 0.0144 and put another line on that level (1.2830) and the last digit for EUR is 233 - so subtract that (1.2974-0.0233=1.2741)as well and put a third line on a chart. Now take a Fibo tool and extend Fibo from 1.2974 down to the last line (1.2741). And you see - what this equates to... Neat, nice and clear. Good luck in hunting pips and embracing Fibs, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Nice first post! Yep... 61.8, 38.2, and 0... Awesome... thanks much!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi! every1 I read all thread and I think that I missed something or I´m completely wrong. The thread starts with the 8/55 sma, the original 4 hours tunnel, but in some point (at the end of December 05) I understand that Vegas suggest to plot a tunnel with 24/28 ema (and disregard the weekly 5/21 sma ) and then plot the fibos like in the 1 hour tunnel. This new strategy was finally introduced at the daily tunnel who is part of the VWB This change is suggested to let you see and make and a strategy based on daily, 4 hours and 1 hour (the black dots) and makes sense if you read the VBW. But, like I said in the beggining, maybe I lost something... because the FF tunnel which is from January 06 has the fibos plot using the 55 sma. My question is: which is the correct way to plot the fibos in the 4 hour tunnel? .from 24/28 ema? .from 55 sma? .none of this two? Thanks... (my first post)

--- 帖子 #420 ---
The 55 SMA is correct for the 4hr model. 24/28 are used in the Vegas Daily Model. Both indicators for MT4 platform can be found in the Beginer section in one of the Stickies. Vegas suggested the Daily to determne the trend as the weekly lagged. I still use weekly as it is built into the 4 HR indicator as a signal UP or Down. I use Dailyh as a confirmation of the trend dir

Right now (1:50pm EST) the EUR/USD price is just breaking the 169EMA boundry. According to the tunnel document this is a BUY signal. The question I have is should you wait for the 12EMA to also break the upper tunnel boundry before you go long?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi agirl, Take a look in the Vegas sticky in the Beginner's Forum and download the FF Tunnel Chart indicator for MT4 (I'm assuming you have MT4). This will give you the lines you need for the 4 hour chart. For the weekly chart, just apply the two moving averages by hand, then save them as a template for use on other currency charts. Eastmael has written a great guide on installing indicators into MT4, but I'm at work and I don't have time to look it up now. Perhaps East or someone will chime in and give you the link. BTW, I got your PM but I'll have to answer it later. I recall it was on the same topic, so maybe I can find East's link for you later. Dial

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Sure Dial. Hi agirl and welcome to the forum! Below are the links Dial's referring to. Here's the vegas sticky in the beginner's forum: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=4365 The FF Tunnel Chart indicator can be downloaded also from the above link, second post. Here's the link to the guide on installing the indicators: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=4497 That's all for now. Hope this helps. Regards, East

PF stands for private forum, meaning the james16 group. It's a private (paid) forum hosted by FF. Check it out, it's really great learning for a fraction of what you would pay elsewhere. They teach some really good systems, price action, money management, trading psychology, etc., all in the familiar form of the Forex Factory forum. I really recommend it! If you think Forex Factory is good, PF is just pure gold. Dane

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Although I spent 3 decades as a programmer (before being downsized) I have been too lazy to learn ML4 yet (though I have all the docs downloaded)... That said (my excuse): Would someone tell me what the dotted green line in the FF Tunnel Indicator represents, please? I can't quite read the code yet. It sort of looks like a butterfly on acid... Thanks, Lou G

--- 帖子 #438 ---
The green dotted line, called the Aphid, is simply the close of 8 bars back carried to the right to bar zero. Bar zero is the current bar. Whenever price crosses the aphid, the 8 SMA reverses slope. The endpoint of the aphid shows the point that price would have to be in order for the slope of the 8 SMA to be neutral or flat.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi all, First post here, i have enjoyed reading everything so far. Yesterdays sharp move in the USD got me thinking about a small modification to the vegas system, and i would be keen to hear the opinion of those who know it well or have the ability to backtest it easily. Normally we buy/sell 3 full or half lots, depending on the momentum given to us by the weekly chart. With the 8SMA on the 4H chart dictating our the majority of our entries and exits. Now a small addition... Now when the 8SMA changes direction(against the weekly momentum), we close out any remaining positions as per normal and trade 1 lot in the other direction until the slope changes again where we will trade our usual 3 full/half lots. This means we are in the market the whole time, still trading with the momentum, but also placing a small trade going against the momentum. This would take no more time to implement than the current method because the entries and exits points are the same. And if it results in a few extra pips each month... why not?? Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi Thuxen, Sounds like you've been lurking for a while, but I'll say welcome to the Factory anyway! As you said, your thinking was inspired by the move of USD. This type of move is irregular and infrequent (relatively speaking), and trying to modify a system to catch every hiccup of the market is a very fast way to kill a system. My belief is that individual trades, and their outcomes, are meaningless. By that I mean they are statistically insignificant. In plain language, they don't count for much. What DOES count and have significant statistical meaning is a long series of trades. Modifying a system to increase the performance of such a series is worth the effort. So adding the rule to tack on a single lot on 8 SMA slope changes against the weekly trend only affects one trade, which as I've said is meaningless. However, a rule such as trading only in the direction of the trend, is an approach that affects an entire series of trades and does have significant meaning. Further, trading against the trend is a low probability trade and is a practice that should be avoided. Finally, by trying to always be in the market with this system, you are subjecting yourself to whipsaws that will quickly erode any extra pips you might pick up trading against the trend. Rather than try to optimize a system to squeeze out a few more pips by trading more often is not as effective with this system as sitting on your hands and waiting for only the A trades. An A trade, if you don't know, is defined as the highest probability setups a particular system offers. For example, with this system, I am currently trading only GBP/USD. This pair just had a run up of 400 pips. This move has me excited, not because I'm in it (I'm not) but because it means that this system is possibly setting up to give a really good primary entry in the direction of the trend. I used to use a shotgun to blast any wiggle of the 8 SMA, but now I only take rifle shots at the best possible setups. Do I get many trades this way? No I don't. Very few in fact, but the few I get pay off. For example, my last three trades on cable using this system yielded around 570 pips in just a few days. That is plenty of pips for me, and I trade with a lot less stress because of the decreased frequency of trading. I have no desire to majorly increase my stress just to squeeze out a few more pips while risking a lot of whipsaws. However, in spite of all I've said, I commend you on doing something that many people don't do. You are thinking, questioning and evaluating and then following up by bouncing your ideas off other traders to get feedback. Just be sure to listen to only those traders who have proven experience. There are only a dozen or so on this forum. Take care, and post often Dial

Hi everyone, I've read all part of the Vega's methods and specialy the 1Hr tunnel. I'm currently trying to test my EA with ForexTester, results are not bad but every range trend kill my profits :-(. Here and example of the problems : - First BUY is a big loose trade - First SELL is a loose trade - Second BUY is a big loose trade - Second SELL is a win trade As you can see not a good period So is there a way to avoid these false signals ? More over, and because my english is not very good in the 1Hr method, if I understood, we send a minimum of 3 orders every times and close on each fib level ? Is that right, or only 1 trade and on each fib level, close and send new order to go to the next fib level ? "Simply" I want to keep my profits and reduce my loose. Thanks for your help Yousky

Fellow traders, As I am converting from the 1H tunnel method to the 4H tunnel method can an experienced 4H method trader asnwer the following question Regarding the 4H tunnel mothod.

I learned more from this site in 2 month then the entire 3 years ive been live trading FX. I believe the next step to my success is to become a member of the PF. FF is like winning the lottery for anyone starting out in FX. This is a big thank you to all the members who have posted all their hard earned knowledge and efforts on this site. Had I found this site when I first started in FX there's no doubt that I would be extremely successful right now.

Hi Yousky,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I'm not sure why you took those trades? Remember, the 1h method we want to trade when the price brakes out of the tunnel. You use the fibs as an indication when to take profit (remember your risk model per currency as described in the Vegas doc!) It seems if your entries are too late. Where you've entered on the first trade, you should've exit. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Are you using VWB method or 1h method? VWB method uses daily charts - and trade back to the tunnel. 1h enter on a breakout from the tunnel&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; rsmit&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #448 ---
hi community, about the 4h method iam not really sure whether i undstand the 4h timeframe right. Lets take the current eur/usd as example. As you can see we have a downtrend this week and should only take short signals, right? Well, the document says (if we are in a downtrend): "We are looking for the 8 SMA to move higher through the 55 SMA. When it does, we carefully watch and notice when the SLOPE of the 8 SMA changes from positive to negative. It will do this when the 8 SMA stops gaining value in one 4 hour bar and loses in the next. This is the 4 hour bar to initiate new short positions with 3 units" I dont understand what he means with: " we carefully watch and notice when the SLOPE of the 8 SMA changes from positive to negative. " Does positive to negative means a cross of the 8sma through the 55sma or is this just the case when the 8sma is at first going up and then heading down (look at attached picture). and "We are looking for the 8 SMA to move higher through the 55 SMA" What does this mean? must the 8sma higher then the 55sma? i descibed the problem detailed in the attached picture. http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/7097/chartwr7.th.gif Many thanks in advance! Mike edit: i read this a minute ago: mrgreen said, that he uses the daily to determine the current trend, how do i do that? Do i have to use the same indicators as i have when i determine the trend in weekly timeframe (descibed in the 4h tunnel method)? Is there already a explanation? I am looking forward to a answer. Thank you! 2nd edit: sorry for putting up another question, but i have this one since i learn trading and now i want to have it cleared. When vegas or someone else speaks about "when the price hits the line" does this mean the close price or any part of the candle? For example if there is a cross of a ma and the price, is it a cross when the candle closes above(below), or when just the shadow (or any part) of the candle crosses the line?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi Mike, The 4 hour method does not use crossovers of the 8 &amp; 55 ma's to signal anything. This is not a crossover system. There are two types of entry for the 4 hour method. I call them "Primary" and "Secondary". In the portion of the Vegas document that you quoted, Vegas is describing a Primary short entry, where the 8 is above the 55, and the 8 has changed from positive slope to negative slope. For a Secondary short, the 8 will be below the 55 and the slope will change from positive to negative. The difference is that Secondary entries are not as reliable so risk is controlled by putting on only half the normal position size. Perhaps the following chart will help clarify. There is a lot of great information in this thread on the 4 hour model and I encourage you to read through the whole thread. I think you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know if I can do anything else for you. PM me if you like. Dial

Thanks for the kind words Mike. I'm just paying forward the help I've received from other traders further down the road than me. If not for their help, I would not have reached the point where trading has actually become easy (most of the time anyway ). If I can do anything to help someone else have that same experience, then I will feel I've paid at least part of the debt of gratitude that I owe. MrGreen will have to answer that question. I use the weekly momentum trend, with only a peek at the daily to see what's inside the weekly bar. For me it is intuitive, and I would be hard pressed to explain how I see it. Sorry. I don't know the context from which you pulled the Vegas quote so I can't answer that directly. In general it means the actual price touching the line. It is a rare occurence for the close to fall exactly on a line, so that isn't terribly useful. In most systems I've seen, if it is important for the close to be in a certain position relative to a line, then it is usually explicitly stated. In other words, there is no hard and fast rule. Dial

Traders,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Using MT4 with the templates provided For the Vegas 4H method I keep getting a warning pop up in my MT4. It states as follows.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; "warning USD/CHF slope change, only trade if price is &gt;1.4000 &lt;1.4600"&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; or&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; "USD/CHF good to trade"&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; These are obviously fictitious prices but can someone tell me what this means. It looks self explanatory but I just want to make sure. Currently I just wait for the newest 4 hour bar to open my trade but if I can open a position earlier then that it would be fantastic. I seems like im missing about 40 or 50 pips of each trade because I wait for the next 4 hour bar. Also I currently put at risk 40 to 50 pips for each trade which makes me a little uneasy. Is this a normal amount of pips for this method and how long does a pro hold an average trade for?Till the fibs or the TS is hit. One last question. As Vegas states you should not open a position between 7pm and 4am est as this is the asian session. Is there any other bad time to open a trade? Also, riddle me this! If the weekly chart is one week behind then how could you use the weekly for trend direction. If you look back on the weekly, the trend could change direction anytime.Im thinking about eliminating the weekly from the mix. Sorry for all the questions but this 4H method got the wheels spinning. Its to the point where all I can do is think about FX. Before FF this was just a hobby. Now I would rather die then not trade FX. Im trying to get to a bigger level of confidence and break away from my scalping habit of 10-20 pips because its gotten me nothing but break even results the past 3 years. Ok thats enough questions for now I hope someone will help me out with this. Best regards, ForexJedi &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

hi again, i now read through the threat and would like to know how i calculate the current trend. Because you often said, that weekly trend calculation is not enough. What is the best way to calculate the "best possible trend"? Thank you mike

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Thanks, Dial I have read a lot of forums and paid a lot of money for E-books that did not help. I have only read a little of this forum and I can't tell you how much this has helped me. Looking forward to moving ahead in my trading. Everything I see is opening my eyes and now I'm trying to put it all together. parttime

--- 帖子 #460 ---
before using the 4h method now, i wanted to ask if someone could explain to me how to determine a "intraweek"-change, because by just following vegas "weekly"-trend change, i am always one 2 week behind the original trend. But now i wonder, what the weekly- trendchange determination is good for? So, i help someone could explain my 2 questions. Another thing i just want to clarify is that the fib numbers are calculated from the 8sma (from the point where the 8sma's slope changes), right? I would also appreciate if someone could post some pictures (just 5-10), where the strategy is used. In this way i could check whether i do now understand the 4h method or not. This would really be nice. Thanks very much in advance! -Mike

Hi Mike, This has been a Challenge of sorts to all who trade VT4. The Weekly Trend Lags By one week! Not to big of a problem because They generally don't change that often............When They Do.............Look out. Still this is a very powerful system! If you use Metatrader4, then search this forum for a indicator Called "FF Tunnel Chart". This indicates a realtime Weekly Trend change at the top of the "4hr" Chart. The Weekly Trend is a affirmation of Trade direction! Probabillities not certainties. If You Figure out how to do the "certainty" part PLEASE POST! Nope! The Fib Levels are drawn fron the 55 ma....... I made this mistake once and was clobbered by Dial! Here's a crummy chart for you. If you scrub "Lost in the Tunnel" for Dial's charts you probably will get a lot more info! Hope this helps! Good Journey HeavyJ

--- 帖子 #462 ---
thank you HeavyJ! But could you explain the trend indicator a little bit more precise? 1. For how long does it approximately show the trend? (I mean, if the trend calculation does only last for the next 5minutes and then the trend will change i would end up in a loss. So how do i know when the trend calcultion will change?) 2. Why am i only allowed to trade if the price is between a certain "price-zone". 3. Which risk model do i have to use? Are they the same like the ones in the "vegas-daily-strategy"? 4. And what does the blue line (or the green dotted one) show(the magenta is 55ma and the red one the 8ma)? 5. Why aren't their the fib levels 55, 244, 377? (Expecially the 55 is a good take profit level, i think) Would you explain also my last questions? 6. Would someone mind posting another picture where the 50 pip rule is? I dont know if iam right, but i learned that when the two mas are in between 50pips you have to use the 50 pip rule (described in post 13). BUT, for how long do the boundaries last? Only for the current bar, or also for the next bars? But at the next bars the boundaries would be at another price level, so i think that the boundaries are only valid for the current bar, right? ouhh.. i think iam confuse now.. Am i talking about the 50pip rule or the neutral line? If iam talking about the neutral line, when do i have to use it? I think it would clarify if someone posts a picture, where the two rules are both used. 7. Is there a way how i can combine the vt1 strategy with the vt4 strategy? Or does the 4h strategy replace the 1h one? 8. If its now profitable, then it will be profitable in 10 years, because market patterns dont change, right? (This is just an idea) 9. How much do you make a month? (This is just my curiosity, you dont need to answer ) Ok, this is all! Hopefully someone takes the time to answer my question. Thank you very much in advance -Mike

--- 帖子 #463 ---
OK Mike! I'll give it a shot! Before I do! Let me give you some advice! SEEK OUT DIAL! Seriously, for the best, cohesive "lesson plan" ever on VT4 strategies try the private forum for one month &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;unsoilcited ad=""&gt; Caution: Bonehead teaching in Red!

Hello All: First post... I've been avidly reading &amp; studying this forum over the last week, and in particular the Vegas models. I am now seriously considering the PF forum to build and expand upon what I have learned thus far. In particular, it seems to me that both GBP and EUR just gave signals with the change of slope on the 4H, although the weekly trends for both still remain UP, albeit with somewhat decreasing momentum from previous weeks. Is this an example of a situation which is discussed/evaluated on the PF, specifically using price action on the weekly at potential trend changes? Regards, fxgorilla

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi fxgorilla, and welcome to the Factory! Yes it is. The weekly momentum is lagging and takes some experience to get a feel for it, but you are right on in your thinking that blending price action in with it is useful. Dial

--- 帖子 #467 ---
thank you heavyJ! You said, that you dont know what i mean with price-level (sometimes also "OK to Trade" is written). It's the simple text, which shows the indicator in the upper left corner. How do you add the other fib levels? Expecially the 55, it isnt at any risk model (0-3) i can use in the indicator. -Mike btw: i would subscribe to the pf, but 120$ is not cheap for me, but i could afford, if i would now, whether the knife strategy will be profitable in future. (because i would need surely some time to handle this strategy and if it then isn't profitable anymore ... i think you know what i mean)

--- 帖子 #468 ---
What is the "PF" please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I'm pretty new here and pretty new to trading. I was looking over the Vegas Wealth Builder Part II document. In Chapters 2 &amp; 3 Vegas looks at daily data and mentions it could form the basis of a day trading system. I would like to look at spot Forex data (EUR/USD &amp; GBP/USD) and try to build and back test a system built on thie daily data. Any opinions on When to start the Day? I am thinking of after NYC and before AUS opening. 23:00 GMT. Thanks for any input.

that is the private forum.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
AH HAAA! Mike the short answer is I don't know for sure! I "believe" that this is a calculation of the 50 pip rule! It is based on a calculation of this Vegas Filter! Mike, I don't know where it is in the vegas stuff on the forum I believe? But there is an excellant post with diagrams ect which shows how to do this. Or....If you want you can try to watch this: Bonehead Movie that I made on the subject. Full screen view provides that "Realizm" ! Point well taken on the $120 bucks..... I hope you realize that there is a veritable plethora of knowledge. Not just the Knife method on this private forum. In this case it probably "costs" you to hang on to that $120......IMHO. But it is good to see that you are cautious in your spending.....lotsa hucksters out there..........James16 Group does not fall in that category. In fact I would say it is the best money I have spent in training. Hope this Helps! HJ

--- 帖子 #474 ---
ForexJedi, These are the "Visual Alerts" in the FF Tunnel indicator. They Warn you that the slope of the 8ma has changed from up to down or versi-vicy! The "Trade only if Price &lt;&gt;" means that at the time of the slope change the price is within the 50 pip rule and trades should not be taken. "OK to Trade means that at the time of the slope change, the price is out side the 50 pip rule and you may "Trade away" when comfortable! I turn them off in the "Input Tab" cause they drive me batty when the slope is oscilting up and down around the neutral line. It is a good idea but I don't use it. I also turn off the audio alerts as well......This is a matter of personal choice. I don't know if you have read all of this thead but it is possible to try an early entry, Based on the slope change + 15 or 20 pips if it is not to early in the current 4 hr bar. Good Luck HeavyJ

--- 帖子 #475 ---
thank you heavyJ! Once again concerning the 50pip rule. I cant understand why it exists in this way, because in some very volatile currencies 50 pips are nearly nothing. But in other currencies 50 pips are so much (sometimes it is the range for up and downtrends, like the eur/gbp, it didnt reach the 89fib line since half a year). Wouldnt it be better, if we take a percentage of, i dont know, maybe the last daily range or so... Just to make a relative value which fits better for the respective currency, instead of taking an absolute one. Just a thought. Mike

Man! I can't tell you how many times I have watched from the sideline while the 50 pip rule had me benched! But you know what? Lotsa folks have already done the hard work of testing this strategery....and their conclusion was that it is more profitable not to enter in the 50 pip exclusion band than to take an entry. But know this! In the 4hr tunnel doc, Vegas encourages us to experiment, in a round about way. If your testing and research shows you a better way than go for it! I'll be cheering you on! (I hate that 50 pip rule....has saved me tho!) I just noticed a new thread started HERE which deals with tweaks to make the 4HR version more profitable. Maybe you guys can bounce your ideas off of one another and make a mint! The 4hr Tunnel is great as Vegas wrote it! But it can be improved! I've seen it! Good Journey HeavyJ

--- 帖子 #480 ---
this is a cry for help... i took some trades now (about 6) and 4 of them were wrong.. I did follow the rules but somehow they reached the stop level and then reversed (this happend often). Where do you set stop loss (approximately) and how much time give you the trend to develop? Greets mike

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Could you post the details about these losses? Maybe we can learn from each others mistakes. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I agree with Bonemeister, post a chart of a couple of your trades when they go wrong. Someone here will tell you what strategy you could have used. Whipsaws suck. That's why I propose starting a new currency market where they will be outlawed.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi! Like HeavyJ already said, I started a thread in which I also backtested the 4h method. I have Januar, June and July 2006 backtested with all trades explained and with notes here , so please take the time if you are interested and check it out. The mechanical trading backtests do NOT! use stops, but assume that you are there for every 4h candle close to manually judge on a slope change, that you will exit. There is no need for stops this way, as it is all signal based. The entering early to not miss 50 pips works against you, too, trust me. Unless it is news making the surge past the neutral line, trading on a "hopeful" candle close price in the FUTURE should only be done if you have traded forex for years and know what's going on, and not in the chasing of pips. Chasing pips loses money and boy do I know. As for 4 out of 6 trades losing : download my attached txt files, you will see how even just one winner out of 6 trades makes a massive profit. The worst drawdown month on a trend changing week out of the three months runs -45 pips TOTAL! For a full month. After the month before doing over a thousand pips. Yes, 1k. So please take the time to check out the thread and the log/backtests, because I am bound to have made a mistake or two perhaps. It does require you to use the same demo platforms to check. Pips are counted 1 pip per 1 lot used in case you wonder how I calculated. So if you make 1 pip profit with 3 lots, it counts 3x 1 = 3 pips and so on. This makes for a precise calculation and normalized results. Any input would be appreciated!

i am using the file called FF Tunnel Chart.mq4 In the screenshot attached...a warning is issued on the top right hand corner.. "trade only if price is &gt; 1.8972 or &lt; 1.8875" How should i interpret this ? I am new to using this Vegas system. Please help.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi Radiohead This is a "50 pip rule" flag from the self same filter in the tunnel docs. This means that the 8 &amp; 55 MAs as well as the price are all within 50 pips of each other. FF tunnel Calculates this "exclusion band for you" it has been suggested by Vegas that putting on trades in this area are not profitable over the long haul. When the price and MAs move out of this zone the message turns to "OK to Trade".... Good Journey HeavyJ

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Thanks for replying. So if it is greater than say price X.. shud i go long or short ? and if it is less than Y... shud i go long or short? What should these entry positions based on ?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
RH, I assume that you have read the 4hr Momentum Tunnel doc by Vegas. If not go to the first post in this thread Here and scroll down to the bottom and download it in Word File format. After reading and studying the file you should be clear as when to enter and exit. The FF Tunnel indicator is a great tool for someone who understands the method. You will not be successful if someone tells you how to enter based purely on lights going on or off in some indie! There are "experts" on using this method (not me) who post regularly in this thread. I suggest that you read the 4hr Tunnel doc above and then scrub this thread for more insight. The 4hr tunnel method is great if you have patience. Good Journey HeavyJ

i just have too many questions about this tunnel trading. i dont consider myself to be a novice, but i know i am far, far away from being skilled in this art. i really want to have a deep understanding of a proven method, and have decided to plump for the veags 4 hour, but as simple as it appears on the face of it..... well you know the rest!! so.... i have now come to the conclusion that i am going to have to get a some real grounding and solid mentoring and join James's group...... i think! but before i do, i cant get past this feeling of ........ "here i go again, looking for somebody else to give me the answers, you know it will end in tears, money spent, answers sought....... butno result" i know you guys have all thrown money away on such things before and now have the same inherent feelings...... please explain to me why this is different. PS. i already read all the testimonials on the site..... but every web site in the world has those.

You're right, we all know where you're coming from! Have a look at the number of subscribers who have been preached to and converted. They come back to the main forum and encourage the rest of those that are interested to give it a shot too. I feel as if the past few days I've joined this promotional bandwagon too!! LOL Problem is you have no idea if they are planted do you? Besides Dials tunnel trading method you're after, James also has some high probabilty trading methods that are so frightingly simple they will help pay for the membership themselves. I CAN tell you... ...if you have a fair knowledge base already, but you are having trouble putting it together and controlling yourself .(Fiji's excellent articles)... ...if you need something that will help you be "more sure" about your entries etc... (even in your existing methods) ...if you would like a number of proven methods available in your toolbox to play with in different markets and timeframes... --Then this stuff can help!

Hi rockrat, Please don't "think" you want to join the PF; "know". If you have any doubts, hesitation or reservations, then please do yourself a favor and do not join. But, if you do join, expect to WORK. We provide answers to questions, yes, but we won't spoon feed you; we'll provide support and encouragement when you're down, but we wont carry you. You can lean on us, but only while standing on your own two feet. We expect your questions to gradually become more complex as time passes. If they aren't, then you're not applying yourself. Our objective is to provide an environment where traders can become self sufficient more quickly than they could on their own. If needed, we'll even kick your butt for you if you desire. Not literally of course, and certainly not meanly, but with tough love at times. Douglas is the drill seargent, Jim is a cuddly teddy bear, and I fall somewhere in between. So you have three different personalities to choose from. Pick who you relate to best, and ask them to guide you. We'll point out the trail, give directions and warn of hazards, but we expect you to walk the path with your own feet. We'll be behind you every step of the way. And if you ever feel we're not giving you what you need, then you have permission to kick OUR butts! (with love of course). Dial

well, i must say that the response from dail and bunny is excellent. I like the idea that more skilled trainers can and will support me in coming to the right decisons, but ensuring that I come to them in the correct manner, without spoonfeeding me. i am about to go on holiday and will sign up on my return sept 5th to maximise my month. if you dont mind, can i confirm what i am currently seeing on the vegas 4 hour charts, and three trades i have just made. i see the "hook" has been formed on the 4 houir chart on cable (long), eur/usd (long) and usd/chf (short). therefore i have open all three trades in those directions Have i done this correctly. The 50 pip rule does not apply.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Whoohooo...I LOVE this response. Some posted a thread in the public forum asking what the PF is all about.....PLEASE, PLEASE find that thread and post this response verbatim to it!!! WOW!!....I am so glad to be a part of this awesome community.!!

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Yes, that is right. Just be aware that these three currencies are closely correlated, so if you trade all three at the same time, you need to reduce your position size. Good job!

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Before I start...I'm a newbie, so please forgive my ignorance. I too have gone long on GBP/USD. why? -hook back formed on the 4H as you mention -weekly momentum is to buy, go long, (little unsure about rate of change of monemtum though, seems to be decreasing, due maybe to uncertainty?) my concerns. -economic news! keep messin wit the system! PPI indicate go long GBP TIC go short (i understand one has more influence then the other) but then add to the mix tomorrows GBP releases. So leads me to feel a little mad, cause one minute I'm up the next I'm down. Would a more experienced vegas 4H trader wait for less volatile entry? I.e after tomorrow..... but also..... if in a 4H vegas trade...........HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE NEWS!!!!

--- 帖子 #495 ---
well, not a happy bunny!! i have to admit i was ready for a bit of a roasting james, to my trading direction, as though the cable trade was correct at the hook with the long term weekly trend, but both the eur and the swiss trades taken were against the weekly trend. I thought you'd tell me off for that! the swissy trade has since hit my 35 pip stop, and the other two are not going the right way currently. i agree with the previous posters comments to news, though in the vegas doc it does state that on major news days we dont trade, but suggests only NFP is the one thats a major.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
No, I wouldn't fuss at you for that. Even Vegas has told me that he uses discretion to oppose the Weekly Momentum trend sometimes. This is especially true during a trend change, and when the weekly chart is stuck in a range. In those instances, the WM lies it's butt off! Truth be told, I became so fed up with the WM that I've dropped it from consideration and am now using the GMMA on both the weekly and daily charts to determine trade direction. BTW, I'm Charles.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
...then it might warrant some caution Hi Just wanted to say that I am as fed up as most of you guys with being unable to determine a clear trend for currency pairs at time, as EUR/USD FF Tunnel indicator was (imho this time rightfully) saying trend is down (and on 4h would have made a profitable trade down from the highs with a full position trade a short while ago *hehe @ wordplay*) and on cable (GBP/USD) it was saying trend is UP.... Well, the first 4h signal failed for around 37 pips (close to close entry/exit) and the second one, had one held it until the next slope change, would again have lost around 15 pips, both on full positions. Which is VERY good and a VERY low drawdown imho. As for why we failed where we did, I posted 3 possible explanations(basically 2, former s/r and .786 level and the trendline) over here I am still backtesting the mechanical 4h method in my thread here in this Niche Forum and would still be happy for any additional ideas and input on my results

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Greetings all My first post ... I would like to thank all who have contributed here to this fine thread, in particular HeavyJ and Dial - your ongoing contibutions and kindness are an inspiration to me. I hail from a distant part of the internet (StrategyBuilderFX forum) where I learnt to successfully trade the Bunnygirl System (basically a 5/20 moving average on 30 min chart) and I stumbled upon Forex Factory a few days ago. I have traded forex part-time for past 5.5 years and the journey has been an amazing experience - not only in learning about the market but also about my own psychology and the hidden demons that come out from time to time to try distrupt my trading success! In this regard I really like Dial's shooting analogy - the shotgun approach vs becoming a sniper with an accurate, high power rifle. My demons would very much like to use the shotgun but I am committed to becoming a world class sniper with enough patience to wait for price to walk into my ambush....every time. :-) I am sure that most of you will agree that trading forex is more of an art than an exact science - we can use whatever indicators etc. on a chart to determine market direction etc. but at the end of the day there is usually an element of subjective analysis that causes one to either enter a new possible trading opportunity or not. My current trading system has a focus on the 30 minute and 1hr charts and from what I have read in this thread and in docs from Vegas has already expanded my horizons significantly and hopefully this will have a positive bearing in future on my own subjective analysis of future trade opportunities. I have learnt to use a "weight of evidence" approach to making the final call before taking or exiting a trade - almost like trying to convince a jury that there is enough evidence to convict the accused... Regardless of what Vegas system you might trade - 1hr, 4hr or daily there is still a requirement to make the correct call on market direction. To this end I would like to offer a small but often powerful piece of "evidence" that may help you with trend determination...it is called "the no-touch" bar/candle. Discovered by Bunnygirl (creator of the Bunnygirl Cross System) the no-touch bar is used to identify possible trend reversals and can be seen on any timeframe. Setup: Put a 5 weighted moving average - close (5WMA) on any timeframe. Notice that usually the 5WMA touches every bar/candle except after a significant move long/short. In situations where price moves strongly in one direction and a doji or inverted hammer is formed that is NOT touched by the WMA5 this is often a strong signal that the trend is about to reverse. I have provided a snapshot of the current cable daily chart and I have highlighted examples of the no-touch candle....hopefully this will help you with your weight of evidence for determining trend direction. If you have questions please let me know.. Thanks.

Sorry if this question have already been asked. Can we apply same rules to Vegas H1 indicator as to VegasCurrency Daily indicator? I mean different models (1-4) to different currency? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
hi guys! i have a question on entering late. i'm not sure if this was already asked before, but anyway, here goes. in the vegas 4-hour method, for example, in a weekly bull market where we are looking to long the currency, we enter when the 8 SMA bottoms out and starts to increase. but what if we enter late, meaning, the 8 sma already bottomed out a few 4-hour bars ago but we still want to place a buy order (since the weekly momentum tells us that it makes sense to go long). is this entry still effective or should i just swallow my pride and admit that i missed that good entry? it's just that when i'm not available to check my charts every 4 hours, but then find out that a good entry could have been made, i feel that i missed out on a good trade to ride on. on the other hand, i feel that i could easily justify the late entry by the fact that the trade was in accordance with the weekly momentum, meaning, the long entry is still a high probability trade - the kind of trades we look for. what do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
If you have to enter late, then don't enter. Count it as a missed trade. You don't have to be at your computer to enter a 4 hour trade. Search this thread for posts by me. As I recall, one of the posts details the entry method I use using a combination of what I call the "Neutral Line" and setting Buy/Sell Stop entry orders to enter the trade automatically. Dial

--- 帖子 #513 ---
That is great advice and something I learned thru experience when I first started trading the 4hr tunnel. Not trading is sometimes the best filter there is .

--- 帖子 #514 ---
oh diallist, i searched the threat but didnt find it. i dont know, could tell us again about settings stop orders, or post the exact reply? Thank you -mike btw: is the current version of v4h much different to the knife-strategy? I join the james16group, but i dont know, if the knife strategy brings as much pips i need for the monthly fee.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hmmm, well, I thought it was in this thread. Let me see if I can find that post and I'll post the link here. You asked if the Knife is very much different from the Vegas 4 hour tunnel. Until recently they were almost identical except for the four changes Team Aphid and I had made. But, I have announced in the PF that I am dropping the original Weekly Momentum Trend indicator entirely. :surprised In it's place will be the GMMA on at least two time frames; PLUS another custom indicator from Team Aphid. This new indicator is so versatile, that I have it on all my charts. I have found this new combination far easier to use to determine trade direction. I am currently putting together a tutorial in the PF on the use of this new indicator combination. Also, I'm testing the new Team Aphid indicator for POSSIBLE use in entering counter-trend trades with reduced risk. This is not in the original V4 at all. Since counter-trend trading is riskier, I don't recommend it for new or novice traders. I'm also considering modifying or dropping entirely, the 50 pip rule. This is a radical departure from the original V4 and makes the Knife a separate system in its own right. Okay, what about the difference between the V4 documentation and the Knife's documentation and support? V4 = A 13 page text document. Knife = A highly graphical tutorial containing detailed descriptions of every aspect of the system; A support thread with over 1200 posts; One-on-one support via email, PM, phone or Skype. Please remember this: the Knife is only a sideline in the PF. Jim's and Douglas' section are the meat and potatoes. My section of the PF is that tiny little sprig of parsley on the side of the plate. If my section were gone today, the PF would still be worth more than $129. Folks, PUH-LEEEZE, if anyone is considering joining the PF, then do it for Jims price action analysis and/or Douglas' psychology and money management and "other ways I make money" section. Don't do it just for my section. Thanks Dial

Dial, I have been feasting heartily on the "meat and potatoes" in the PF for the last month, and benefiting beyond description...... and indeed it has been a full time job going through all the material by Jim and Fiji. But dude.....really....from what I have perused in your section, all I see is another big slab of juicy steak! I know parsley, and that ain't it! -Jon

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi Dial Clearly there is little to compare between the Knife and the traditional V4. I would be very interested to get your feedback on your experiences with the success rate of the Knife, how long have you traded it live and what sort of win/loss ratio, profit and drawdowns have you experienced? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Fxjourney, I have posted a thread in this niche forum that has backtests for two months for the 4h method. I might add some more when I find the spare time. The knife is at least as profitable in the original adaption/the 4h based version, if not better if the GMMA and other additions work out. By the way Diallist, I am sorry if I have offended you in my last mail, it wasn't directed against you per se, it was me trying to reason with myself more than anything. As for the Guppys, look out for the "bubbles" on the small/short term GMMA, the fastest EMA on it, it tends to "bubble" as can be seen on your E/J example and when that happens a rubberband-like bounce back usually occurs next. This might be usefull as some sort of headsup for entry/exit help? Just wanted to mention it Vegas also has worst case scenario statistics for the 4h method in the 13 page document mentioned which can be found in another thread in this niche forum . Hope this helps Good luck with trading! ----- no losses say the bosses only profits make me gay (the "happy" one, you silly willies!) trade with knife and diallist and cool folks like heavyJ but for truest satisfaction try james trading on price action ;D and if you ever do get edgy and your tummy's feeling squishy remember what you read from fiji =)

Thank you SeekingLight. I am aware of the stats provided by Vegas in his document - am very interested to compare the Knife results so hence my question earlier.

Hi guys, I'd like tu put the 1 hr Vegas tunnel formula in metastock.I've already red the document but the values I have are not like those I have in the mt4 platform.Is this the formuma?: median price between 144 and 169 EMAs and then add and substract 34,55,89,144 pips....Is it ok? Canados

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Don't think the "34" is needed.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I red that the "34" is used in risk model 1. Is the calculation I described right? Canados

--- 帖子 #523 ---
In a very slow or range bound market, lower fib #'s for profit taking are perfectly acceptable to use. It all depends on the level of risk you wish to take.

hi sir dial! is the gmma indicator taught in the knife system or is it also available to those just following the vegas 4-hour method? thanks!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi magicwords, I'm requoting Dial in order to answer your question. So as to your question : is the gmma indicator taught in the knife system or is it also available to those just following the vegas 4-hour method? Based on the above quote, the gmma indicator will be taught together with the knife system. However, currently, the tutorial is under construction . But if you want to learn about GMMA now, I suggest you checking out this thread first: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...highlight=GMMA Also, I'm requoting this one just in case someone doesn't take it seriously: Hope this helps.

The Guppy Multiple Moving Average is freely available. Just Google it for lots of info on it. Try the key words "GMMA", "Guppy Multiple Moving Average" &amp; "Daryl Guppy". I also recommend Daryl's book "Trend Trading" which gives a detailed treatment of the GMMA. I use the GMMA along with a proprietary indicator in the PF. Dial

i am currently trying the Vegas 4 hour , and i have plotted the FFtunnel chart ,you know the one that shows the weekly momentum with either up or down , This is really frustrating because the indicator when i refresh the chart show up on the weekly direction , and other times shows down how reliable is it , currently i am considering shorting the AUD on the 4 hour chart not because of the Vegas 4 hour rule . There is a pin bar formation , and the weekly trend direction was down so for me that was good conformation to take the AUD short , Then i refreshed the chart and the weekly direction was up.. Does anyone out there have the same thing happen to them ?????

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi vinn It may be a difference in our data feeds, but if you're talking about the 4-hr chart I don't see a good pin bar. Ideally the open &amp; close of the pin should be within the body of the preceding bar. On my chart that bar (pin) opened and closed above the previous bar. I can't advise you how to play this, as you must make your own decisions, but I would suggest 'if in doubt - stay out'. There will be another along sometime. Peter

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi vinn234, if you want my take, I don't think 4h or 1h TF are a good guess for price action setups unless you get a really really clear and perfect looking thing or have a lot of other signs helping things along. Also remember, as you scale down timeframes, so do you scale down the amount of pips. (Eur/Jpy made a pin bar on 1h for example and price so far has exceeded it for all of a "whopping" 25 pips, but I've seen less reaction. Of course, since it coincided with a fib area just underneath it, it could be a good starting point. But that's no longer the pin alone then, is it?) As for AUDUSD, I believe we are currently taking another run at the resistance that kept price in it's range before, and I feel euro and cable are doing the same as well soon. Looking at daily it has been making bullish bars and so far I don't see a clear sign of reversal on my chart. I'd either go by former resistance or fib clusters and then look for signs of reversal near there via either price action or using simple systems like MACD or similiar crosses, if large/significant/clear enough. My 4h on my timezone (GMT+2) doesn't have a significant pin. Attached a gif which shows 2 possible but badly made pins.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Peter thanks for the reply, i thought that the pin set up had noting to do with the preceding bar i took a short trade on a retracement up @.7710 and currently price is @ .7686 ,i wish you could be more specific in the pin bar formation thanks much vinny

--- 帖子 #533 ---
hey SH then how big should the pin bar be is there a criteria that should be followed thanks V

--- 帖子 #534 ---
If you do a search on the forum you'll find lots of posts, but the best place to start is http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=2331 There's a quick look at a way to approach pin trading here http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...6448#post86448 The thing to remember is: (1) Weekly pin has more significance than Daily.. (2) Daily pin has more significance than 4-hourly.. (3) 4-hourly pin has more significance than Hourly.. (4) &amp; so on But the best pins have their Open &amp; Close INSIDE the previous bar. Peter

--- 帖子 #535 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=6721 Has two great PDFs and pictures included. Also I believe Peter meant to say 4h is more important than HOURLY. Safest pins are from daily or bigger, but 4h can also give some good ones IF they have a long nose in comparison to the body and the open/close isn't too freakish I guess. Also the open/close being inside the previous bar range is a must imho. I posted a gold chart which shows some good pins that really are making the race currently and it helps when they are right on support levels. LOOK OUT WHEN THE SETUP IS NEAR S/R AND FIBS! Could be your pin breaks, hits a resistance 5 pips later and totally reverses on you...best spot as always is extremes, see that gold example... Best of luck!

Well spotted SL, can you believe I read that at least twice before I posted? Peter

Hey all, I just started using the FF tunnel chart, how do i trade with that indicator? what can the dotted lines do? Is it helpful?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
The dotted lines are fib levels (distances in pips from SMA55) and are used for booking the profit. Well that’s short explanation, you should better read the whole thread, for understanding some moments. Hope this can help: http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/3...raudzh0.th.jpg I also want to thank Dial, Vegas and all who contributed in development of this system/model. Great job!!! But I have some question to Dial: I have noticed that FF-tunnel don’t always shows correctly weekly trend. May be you can recommend some method, of course except TA, may be some indicators. Thanks.

In the 4 Hour Vegas model it says in section III. The 4 Hour Momentum Tunnel Method -- Step 2. in paragraph 11 that "2) the market moves down, there is no slope change, and goes to the 144 or 233 fib number from the 55 SMA line, where 1 unit is taken off, Question Using (MT4) Meta trader to graph out a particular currency just how do I Set my fib numbers from the 55 SMA line . Anyone have a script for this in the 4 Hour Method??

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I have a similar experience with 4hour method. Even the slope has changed I newer knew if that's the right point to open the position. And because of the bussy, I have moved on Daily method. As I began with that, I have made 11 positions and 4 of them was lost. I used only 0.5 lot and made 3.2k by 6 positions. I can only recommend what Vegas said: Mos important is Discipline and than to perform trading like Humpty-Dumpty. 3 of my lost positions have been made because of not keeping his recommendations. Based on those, I can say that Daily method is profitable.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
The Vegas freebies you are referring to expired as far as I know. I believe the deadline was a signup before the end of July to get the free Vegas signals subscription. (You can of course still sign up for them through his website seperately, but you'll need a funded eGold account vs. just a credit card for the PF) I can however tell you that I believe an ongoing education in the PF will be more beneficial in the long run to a trader and towards becoming an independent trader, than just blindly following signals(no offense!) as you get them (or miss them, if you are asleep). Even though the weekly blog Vegas posts is also VERY interesting to read each time. But it's all a personal choice. Read the threads and posts by james16 in the public section and see for yourself if you think it's worth it!

Hey Swami, Thanks for putting a link to the Vegas 4 hour with fibs mt4 plug in. Just curious, the 8 SMA and 55 SMA don't seem to match the ones I have placed on my charts.

Hi diallist, I just heard about the vegas tunnel method. But I'm really confused. I read the 1H tunnel method and it said on the 1st step it's using 3 ema which are 169,144 and 12. But on the 2nd step, it said "memorize or write down and keep next to your trading screen the following fibonacci number sequence:1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377. For trading purposes, the numbers of interest are 55,89,144,233 and 377" I really didnt get it. What they actually meant? Thanks for ur attention..

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Can anyone help me?? I just read the tunnel method by vegas. I really didnt get how to put the fib. I know that fib means fibonacci. But I usually use fibonacci retracement provided by MT4. I assume the fib which are written in vegas file are MA's. Am I deadly wrong? And also I put in my 1H chart the FF Tunnel Chart that I got from vegas files. But once more I'm confuse with many lines. And I didnt know how to read the trend (what each line means). The method said that 12 ema works for filter. what it means? and how I can see it works? Thank u very much..

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi C1ro, Im new to this trading as well but i may help u little, if u read vegas document properly this fib numbers are the level that u can take profit from long or short position u took, for example: vegas ever say for GBP/USD use fib level 1 and 3 (89, 144, 233) what u need to do is when market break tunnel ( 144 &amp; 169) ema : - if its break towards above the tunnel go for Long (buy) - if its break towards below the tunnel go for Short (sell) once u into position calculate medium of tunnel by (upper ema + lower ema)/2 = medium of tunnel Vegas ever mention about divide ur trading unit into 3 and here the fibo number function: let say u took possition with buy 10 unit, from medium of tunnel calculate 89pips towards upper or lower the tunnell according long or short possition u took. for this example u need calculate towards upper FROM medium of tunnel the tunnel and if market reach that point u need to sell 3.3 unit from ur 10unit buy and then move on to 2nd fib number which is 144, calculate from medium of tunnel 144 pips, if market reach that point sell another 3.3 unit from ur balance 6.7 unit left and same for the third fib number and as my study, FF tunnel chart are great use for 4hour chart and not 1 hour tunnel, 4 hour chart is different with 1hour tunnel.... i advice u read vegas document few more times and u will understand more about differences from daily tunnel, 1hour tunnel and 4hour method... sorry if my language is not perfect thanks

Dear all, I'm very interested in Vegas's 1H Tunnel Method. I've read the document for this, but I'm quite confused about the implementation, so could someone please give me more example and implementation for this 1H Tunnel Method? How many positions must we open for each trading? Does each position to be opened in one time one price or many times in different prices? In his example in this document for GBP/USD, why in the last one sentence he said we should take partial profits at 1.8475 and 1.8509? I know 1.8475 and 1.8509 are 55 and 89 respectively from 1.8420, but when we want to determine the exit target, we must look at the upcoming price's ema and then use the fib number for computation toward the price's ema boundary or it's median, mustn't we? So why we use the ema 169 (1.8420) since this ema is for cable when it's price is at 1.8300? I've tried to contact Mr.Vegas via e-mail as mentioned in his document, but I got failure notice from my e-mail server. Thanks for your help and reply... Regards, Edy

hi c1ro, i just see your attachment and im not surprise if you confused... Basically what i can say is you make your chart too complicated by applying many analysis together, my advice is u may have many method in ur mind bt in order to study vegas method u must use ONLY what vegas ask to do until you can understand then u can apply other analysis if you want to improve more... For example just create 1 4hour GBP/USD chart either bar, line or candle, but i prefer candle because its gave me a lot of information, apply vegas risk model 1 and 3, then add 55SMA (H+L)/2 and 8SMA (close) Im refering to my chart which i will attach together, if you analyze the chart, 8SMA will closely follow the market compare to 55SMA and in my understanding there would be few circumstances happen, and the most important things we need to see is the value of 8SMA and 55SMA every 4hour candle. Ussually wat i will do is if market on uptrend i will closely follow this 2 SMA line, if market continuesly move up the value of 8SMA of last completed 4hour candle will more then the value of 8SMA at previous candle, i hope u understand this statement, i will follow the market until the next completed candle and if the 8SMA keep increasing i will keep watching, there would be a moment 8SMA stop increasing value and u will find the value of 8SMA is same as previous 8SMA, this is place we need to watch closely when 8SMA value is same as previous 8SMA value its mean the market might have changes in trend so what i will do is i will check and compare the value of current 55SMA compare to previous 55SMA value, if the value keep increasing eventhough the value of 8SMA is level with previous i will continue watch market bt if the value of 55SMA stop increase same as 8SMA its mean market will change the trend.. either i will close my position or close part of position its depend on which fibo level i am... ok, for make my trading more simplify wat i will do is ussually i will write down on paper value of 8SMA and 55SMA on each completed 4hour according to market. another thing i will watch is the different with current gap between current 8SMA and 55SMA compare to gap of previous 8SMA compare to 55SMA, the closer the gap mean chances the market change trend is very high.... i hope this explaination would help you much, this purely my understanding about vegas method and it might have some mistakes so hope if anyone have better way of understand vegas method i will more happy to learn that as well i will attach my graph together with FF tunnel which i use for this chart, actually this FF tunnel i get it from this forum and im just resend again.

Hi Sundra, I think we still have different chart. I can see yours has the upper line which is closer to the candle. And look at the number of MA+2 and so on, they show different price level between your and mine. And actually I dont know how to read the tunnel itself when the price level is too far from the tunnel as u can see in mine. Hope u can understand what I'm trying to say

Hello Everyone, I have recently studied this thread and have to conclude that it is one of the most enlightening things on this forum. It is very good to see how people's curiosity and drive for improvement leads to new ideas on old systems. I was wondering whether anyone here is still active in improving on the Vegas methods. I know that diallist's knife rests heavily on tunnel trading. But apart from that has anyone over the last months/years done some other work with new ideas? For instance, I have played around with the 1h system recently and tried to find some additonal filters to avoid the chop. I observed that ususally the best signals are those where the breakout is accompanied by strong momentum and a build up in volatility. Hence I applied a simple rule which states only to take break outs when 8 period ADX slopes strongly upward and the bar breaking the tunnel closes at or higher than a 5 period outer Keltner band. This seems to improve the system in the sense that not as many positions will be opened and stopped out. I have not done any backtetsting but am demoing it and results seems to be ok. As the system will tend to take more advanced moves I actually take away more than just 1 lot at the first fib level. Well, anyway, I was just wondering whether anyone has done similar things and has any promising results. Just to revive the discussion. Hope to hear from you. Best

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I notice reading the thread a lot of changes from begining to end . I wonder what are the experts here using for daily weekly hourly. can someone post the last meta files being use tks

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I've been looking at the Vegas Systems and am currently looking at the Vegas 4 hour system. This strategy originally took 4 hour trades where the momentum turned back in the direction of the weekly trend. A modification added (effectively) a daily overbought/oversold measurement and permission to trade against the weekly trend if daily was overxxx'd and price action supported it. One way to quickly improve Vegas is to use Hull Moving Averages instead of Simple Moving Averages for the weekly and 4 hourly signal (short) mas. Tune the Hull so that it gives no more false signals than the simple ma and you will find it usually gives its signal 1-2 periods in advance of the sma. This is usually a faster result than even the "predictive" use of the sma turning points and avoids the risk of reversal on close when predicting. Merry Xmas Everyone

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hello everyone, Still working on this system? have you tried to apply any more powerful filters on the system? Vegas said "If the difference between the 21EMA and the 5 EMA is &gt; 500 pips, then the pip difference from the prior week must change by more than 10 pips, or just go lower over 2 consecutive weeks, to signal a trend change." I think this means when the weekly momentum is too strong, more price reverse needed to confirm a trend change. But there is no filter for weak weekly momentum, when weekly momentum is weak, the gap between the 21EMA and the 5 EMA close to 0, maybe a lot of false signal will be produced. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Another thought about the signals, Vegas said "when 8 SMA will not be above/below the 55 SMA" only take half unit positions. So those signals are not as good as standard signal. But when the trend is very strong, the retracement maybe can not push 8 SMA back above/below 55 SMA, miss some chances reenter the trends? Any thoughts about this?

--- 帖子 #570 ---
bump for greatness.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
The conversations between Diallist, Heavy J, and quite a few others make this thread a must read. For the basic relation to the 4 hour method, posts 25, 381,382, 383, and 449 are excellent.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I don't believe that I found this discussed, however, the trick with the 8 sma can be replicated with the 5 sma (on the weekly chart) if you are following the "purist" view of this method still. Go 5 bars back and the when price moves to the close of that area, the sma is now "neutral". This just helps a bit IMO.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
As a matter of fact, there was a short trade initiated last night based on the method. Personally I love taking the vegas dynamic fib areas as areas of take profit, and ALSO areas to look for reverting price action to trade back towards the 28 ema tunnel and subsequent fib levels on the way back up to it. It's also useful to look at price action in order to maintain your position along the way. For instance, today there was a continuation pattern on the eur/usd 4 hour after the signal was given- this will be used to place stops lower (above the bar) and reduce risk further. I'll be trading that until the first fib, with profits locked in after and then letting them ride to the consequent dynamic fib areas thereafter. On the weekly, we saw, 5 weeks ago, the bearish bar to initiate shorts (for me) at a solid area of S/R.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
I enjoy using these dynamic fibs as areas of take profit as well, because the further the trade progresses, the further they progress. As the market continues to go lower, so will they. This, in relation with price action, is a fantastic way to exit positions. If a pin comes up before a fib level comes up and closes your position, what do you do? Duh, you close for profit. I do anyway, because that means that the chances of getting there are much less than before. Why walk away with B/E when you can still walk away with 100 pips bagged?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I'll be posting more as I get my charts set up later tonight. (I'm on vacation and not on my regular computer lol) Some friends will be over later so I'm gonna go get pretty for the time being. If anyone would like to add anything, feel free to comment or call me an idiot for my thought processes. I'd appreciate feedback with ways to enhance our trading even further yet. Have a good one ladies and gents.

In the meantime, Dial's posts are golden on the trend changes and entries, especially on the 50 rule and others. Just read em all. Don't shortchange yourself.

I was just fooling around trying to code this up for tradestation and so far the results after 2006 were not very good. I know there is a "knife" version out there but I'm wondering if anyone is trading any of these latey. peace

Bumping to bring it back up, maybe get some fresh interest ? While here, if this thread gets any fresh interest...please, please read the thread from the beginning all will be revealed, after all it ain't amounting to thousands of pages of reading. I have lost count of the amount of posts I have read in this thread asking the same old thing...what does PF mean ?, how do I plot the active Fib lines ?, what are the active Fib lines for ? etc etc. These questions arise time and again and are obviously from people who couldn't be ar@ed to read the whole thread and jump right in wanting people to spoon feed them the answers. Sometimes things need to be explained by people who have a good grounding in the method, but asking simple questions (such as - what does PF stand for) that have been asked and answered numerous times in previous pages is "sheer lazyness". "Rant over", lol.

Hi, Folks New here but not to trading. I have a few questions about the FF tunnel and would like to find a current thread concerend with the Vegas system. Searched all of Vegas posts and Diallist but still can not find a current thread. I think this system is still effective, if combined with Good S&amp;R and a good knowledge of price action. Having a reasonable understanding of both of the above foundations, I am applying this to the vegas system. Just took my first setup off of this BUEOB, two thirds of profit are already off the table and even if it comes back on me, despite not being phsically at BE yet, I shall still be ahead. I am wondering why the tunnel does not show the Neatral Line on some pairs. You can see that on AUD/JPY the line is not shown. I also noticed this on CAD/JPY. Anyway, any pointers to the vegas thread apreciated. Thanks in advance

I am probably talking to myself here, and that is ok to. Took more profit at the projected monthly High as I have seen Charles (Diallist) do. Still in the trade with a portion of the original stake for one reason, that being that I am already at BE+ and with the remainder, I may catch a runner. This runner may not be that profitable but, it may pay the spread on the next 10 trades I take. I think this is what it is all about.

Could possibly end up as a daily BUEOB. Albeit, at a SH. What fun.

Suddenly, the FF tunnel has decided to show me the neatral line, for some absurd reason. Could be fate, have experienced a lot of that stuff this evening. Honestly. LOL

If this H4 PB gets its back broken, we could well be in for a runner. Switched to the white chart for visability purposes.

PB back broke but, it took my SL out at BE+ with the tail of that almost DBLHC, or the widening spread did. Probably the only business that can sell you something, then you charge you more for it later. LOL Will probably see it hit 84.13 pretty soon.

Price just hit the 84.13 We can look for a possible reversal signal from here. Pretty interesting system when combined with S&amp;R &amp; PA

Hi all pros here, I was led to this thread from ICWR strategy and I really benefited from the discussion. It is somewhat a long winded story to read but I do enjoy reading here. Thank so much.

Hi, I am not sure whether this question has been raised at here before, coz I am slow reader, just got started days ago. How can I tell the value of 8 MA? Is it mean that when the 8 MA moving up upper of the candle bar called move toward positive? And vice versa for move toward negative? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Ok, I had found myself the answer, thanks anyway.
