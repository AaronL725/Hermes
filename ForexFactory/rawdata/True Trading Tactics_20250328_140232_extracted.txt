There is no ‘holy grail’. But I give you this, a very simple, sensible and profitable system that can be used on any pair. It's not revolutionary, hell it may already be the same as other trading systems, I don't know. But I like to call it true trading so if it's already here then it's worth repeating. As for time frames again any, but I advise AGAINST 4hr as many brokers have different start/finish times. 1hr is ideal, so is daily for the working man (set and forget) The first chart is a typical 1hr chart, full of highs and lows.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Now look at the chart and look for candles that have reached a peak high and then turned sour (turned and finished red). Then do the same for lows (were red and turned green). In case this is unclear below is a crude knock up of a typical chart showing what I mean

--- 帖子 #3 ---
More, please...

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Now here is the chart again with arrows pointing to the one’s I mean. See how the market makes a new high and yet cannot keep the candle above it’s open, so on a ‘high peak’ a candle opens, goes higher and turns green, however the rise cannot be sustained and the market drops. The candle falls below its open and turns red and eventually closes red (call it the reversal candle). We now look to sell at the break of the bottom of this candle ‘reversal candle’. The candle that breaks this is the ‘breakout candle’.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The numbers on the chart on the previous post are profits (if we take the size of the ‘reversal candle’ as our take profit). As you can see much more could have been taken. It shows approx. one week, with 9 trades, 1 loss, 1 BE, 7 wins and a profit of 162 pips. The SL was take at the high of the reversal candle giving a 1:1 ratio, however below shows other options to keep SL’s lower giving greater ratios

more charts from this week..

i'll post some more info shortly..

Hi K,so how many pips does one have in profit to bring to b/e,thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Simply the best. Great start K. Will follow your thread.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Kraven, based on what you said, this can easily be backtested on a long history of data as the rules can be completely mechanical, have you done that? Without that, it's hard to claim that it works on any pair/time frame. If you give me a sufficient reason(ing) I will go and backtest it on 10 years of data but it will take me a few hours of coding and I would rather not do it if I don't have a good reason to believe this is worth my time (I don't actually believe it works long term, if applied consistently).

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Tedge i tend to get out when the market appears to go flat....i.e seems to move around my entry area a few times. Most of the time you will see a 'good strong' move in the direction of the entry.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Re-entry and possible exits.. if you want to try for more pips then your SL (1:1) then exit on the first pullback bar (see pic) as you can always re-enter..... Wait until a trend develops. A trend for me is 3 bars or more going in the same direction, steeper the drop/climb the better. Wait for a pullback of 1 or 2 candles. Enter on the break of the pullback candles. Works on all timeframe but stick to 1hr and daily.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
the last pic is the GU 1 hr at this minute

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Based on your rules, you should go long on the break of the first (green) pullback in the picture, am I understanding your rules right?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
do you double up lots if you take a loss K?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thank you Kraven. Very good thread. I will follow. Do you trade at London, New York or Asia open or time does not important? You open a position any time when you see such set up?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
last pic as this is time consuming... just knocked this pic up of recent EJ 1 hr...good pair to trade with this. you will see i'm showing start entries, also re-entries, plus what i call a 'dead stop entry' it's bascialy when the next candle reaches the previous high and turns back pretty much to the pip.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi Kraven, A very interesting strategy you have here. I have one question on the GU chart. The candle you use to look for re-entry, is this candle also a buy signal, such that a break of the candle upwards is a buy entry? (approx where you took profit on your short) N

--- 帖子 #19 ---
just some quick replies.. Nick'em if we have a nice trend...say 3 good bars then the next candle pullsback, i often take profit when the pullback candle closes and then put an order in at the break of the pullback candle in the direction of the original trend. Tedge if i take a loss i just take it. i don't double up. if you let them run you can get some good R:R aQuant can you show me the candle you mean. there's a chance it was an entry that i missed. If you want to back test then do, I just started this thread to help others with an easy way to trade. it's not perfect but i do well with it. but remember if markets go flat i will get out, sometimes this works for me sometimes i've missed big runs doing this

--- 帖子 #20 ---
doesn't matter to me...obviously the busier the better, if we get a rejection of the price (which is what happens when we get a reversal high/low candle) then the more volume pushing it away from that level the better, hence the nice steep candle patterns i like.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
In post #12, you should go long on the break of the green bar on the bottom, instead, you mention shorting it again if the pullback candle gets broken, unless I misunderstood. I don't criticize the method, it just seems to me that when applied mechanically (as the rules are clearly objective), it won't make money in the long run. There could be some discretionary twists that you apply to it causing you to make money long term, I just don't believe that if you executed every single signal you would have a winning strategy (if yes, one could just trade this in an automated fashion...).

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Sorry aQuant i see what your saying and you'd be correct. As i was quickly doing this chart as it happened i missed that, however i will say as there's a lot of news now (NFP etc) and the news pushed the pound down i'd be reluctant to get in...saying that it's a bet we'd still be in. I don't do anything mechanical (above shows why).....if i'm in good profit and there's big news about then i'll not close the bet but i will move SL to secure some profit. It's common sense stuff really. e.g. i was both in GU and EU short (candle reversal at the top of a trend) but as it's NFP day i didn't want to be in both so i move SL to BE on EU so i was protected from the potential of 2 losses.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
What do you do if the "reversal candle" is a doji? Thanks for your help. Steve

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Well i'm going for lunch, so i'll leave you all with one more pic and this: "if your not trading successfully then give this a go for the next 2 weeks" dump your indicators, make your charts basic and look at them over the weekend and pick the entries out.... Here's the GU daily now.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
here's the pic...

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi kraven Thanks for this new thread. Your trading idea is quite similar to what I have been doing for months with reasonable results: A win% of 63 and a Win/Loss ratio of 2.55. I think your approach means a better win% but also fewer trades. Some of your charts have an indicator in upperleft corner showing dynamic intraday distances to ADR range. I have been looking for that indicator for a long time. Would you please With kind regards, Finn

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Finnsol, do you use objective rules to enter your trades? (that is, completely mechanical, albeit execution might not be...) It seems that 63% winning percentage with winners being 2.5 times larger than losers is excellent.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi aQuant Not quite mechanical. Considering time of the day. I prefer London session. Avoid nearby daily pivotlines. Avoid news. One mechanical criteria: The body of the reversal candle must exceed 10% of the actual ADR(40)... TP=ADR(40) x 30% SL= -do- x 25% I'm an ADR-fan Finn

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hello Finn, I know your pain...I too searched for a long time for a good ADR indicator and believe I found the best around. It also plays an important part in my hourly trades.....e.g. if i get a reversal candle over the daily range then that is an almost certain profitable trade....likewise if i get a re-entry outside the ADR i'm more cautious and will move SL to BE very quick.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I should add that last month was a losing one - no holy grail here. But the preceding 5 months were excellent Finn

--- 帖子 #31 ---
[quote=kraven;5354157]Hello Finn, I know your pain...I too searched for a long time for a good ADR indicator and believe I found the best around. Thanks a lot kraven! Really appreciate it!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
no problems Finn the ADR lines appear dotted and thin until the ADR has been hit, then they appear big and bold. Also shows a nice write-up in the corner. Remember to set it to your brokers TF.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Not that i'm in this but the entry aQuant pointed out has turned into a decent bet. if your unsure 6 candles ago we had a reversal candle (it broke the low and turned positive) we would have entered (on a normal day..no NFP) on the break of this.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Karven Can you please show the T/P for these entries on the chart. King Regards Yonas

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Very nice thread! Interesting to follow. Keep it going! This is true price action thread. General idea is based in reversals.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Okay kraven - after applying your indicator I see it's not quite what I hoped for. To add and subtract a half daily range to the open doesn't tell me anything. My dream-indicator is dynamic during the day. Should add the ADR-value to the current low of the day. And subtract the ADR from the current high of the day. Whenever a higher intraday-high is printed the expected low of the day is increased accordingly. The distance between current high and expected low should be constant = ADR. :nerd: I know it sounds complicated, but should be a rather simple task for a coder. Let's keep looking

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yonas i find taking profit is a personnal or a timely decision. my main goal is not to see a winning position turn to a loosing one. a lot of the time i take half at 1:1 and move the SL to BE, then exit the rest at the close of the next candle that's in the 'wrong' direction to the trend. But if the market moves quick i'll just ride it through moving SL to BE as quick as possible here's the pic again marked 1 to 4.. trade 1 SL is 60 pips, the reverse candle is 100....so if we took the reverse candle as our TP then it's over 1:1.5 RR.....or if we exited at the close of the first 'wrong' candle that 113. trade 2 SL 50, rev candle 60, 'wrong' candle 103... 1:2 r:r trade 3 SL 70, wrong candle 140...rr 1:2 trade 4 SL 50, wrong candle 60...rr 1:1.2

--- 帖子 #38 ---
You've got my attention. Reading with intent.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
glad you like the idea. i believe you can only succeed in this game using price action. no disrespect to the thread above and below this one but i bet it's full of indicators. I can say without seeing the system that it will not work, it can't. someone once asked me why i didn't use/disliked indicators...simple they can't work... look at all the thousands out there...take one, say a MA, now look at all the variants...SMA, EMA, etc....plus the period 10, 15, 40, 35 etc...now the shift applied to the close or median or open..now which timeframe 1m, 5m, 15m, 4hr, weekly?. lets say a person has 2 SMA's at 8 and 15 and looks for the cross on a 15min, that's totaly different from the guy who has the same set-up on a 1hr...change the set-up to EMA and its totally different to the guy who does it SMA. now throw in some Stochastics at 5,3,3 or will we have 14,5,5....or will we have MACD but which setting 12,26,9 or 8,20,6???? or RSI at 12, 7 or 21.....the only way this would work is if EVERYONE used the same indi's at the same settings on the same TF. which we don't (rant over )

--- 帖子 #40 ---
These bars do work but if you just take every one that comes along you will loose. You have to find the right situations. If you only took three or four trades a week but had an impressive win rate and good r/r would you be happy? Think before you answer. Most people act in their trading as if they can't make money unless they are trading all the time. This leads to overtrading. I am going to include a couple of charts illustrating some good setups but you have to wait for them. Any one hour bar that makes a new high and finishes red could loose money for a trader but that same bar in the right place is a sure fire money maker. Study these and go find some to trade but be prepared to sit all day and not take a trade you must have patience.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Example two above should read testing demand not supply. I have shorts on the brain today after selling NFP report.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Precisely, if the trades are placed based on the S/R or PPA, then we can increase the profit percentage. In other words it will be a high potential trade. Good work Kraven. Regards, Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I have long been a fan of follow the 1hr and will be interested to see where this goes. Never looked at them on such a simple level. Holy cow drop all lines from my charts ok got some homework to do.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
well said sir. now that makes sense. there is a lot of price repetition if you analyze the ranges of monthly, weekly and daily candles. Ultimately this kind of analysis enables you to assess average, min and max reward to risk ratios that are available and how often they appear. As a result this is a good way to determine how often one should trade in order to be profitable. I think that a reward to risk ratio of at least 5:1 is more appropriate based on my experience with the market Personally i think you have some interesting ideas regarding low risk entries at support and resistance. I will definitely explore your suggestions.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
back in November 2010 I asked did anyone have an indi for these bars in this post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=267126 I was trying to use it on a 5min chart then, I never did find one. It would make it so much easier to back test a few time frames if someone could make one now please

--- 帖子 #46 ---
You're never too old to learn and look at old concepts with a new perspective. I would agree with some comments that taking every trade blindly this method might well not be a winner but using some good old common sense it is effective. OK first off all excuse the horrible squiggly lines at the bottom of the chart. Each days first x trades I wouldn't take as they are too late in Asian session, would need to consider entries much earlier but I'm sleeping then. 30 Jan. The left arrow down certainly a trade and there is a continuation sell trade also. Due to time of day the arrow up would only be considered as a scalp buy (for me). 31 Jan. Arrow up certainly a buy and either way a small trade win or lose. Nice sell. 1 Feb. The initial buy was nice. Arrow down a small losing trade and the arrow up would have me looking to buy given the lower wicks. US session small loser and small winner IF you entered on small red doji to buy. 2 Feb. The thumbs down is a losing trade but would you enter after a 50 pip candle, I personally would be very cautious about that. Then 3 winning trades. OK 4 days doesn't make a summer but you have sparked a new little twist in how I look at things. So thanks for that and good luck with your thread.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
As the OP guessed in his first post, this concept is not new. In fact, over here is an indicator I designed and had made for this exact thing: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=320372 (I did NOT invent this concept, either. This indi, yes. But not the idea behind it.)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
To my experience, what you asked for is exactly what this indicator does; how has your experience been since you made this post? I don't know how you came to the conclusion that "To add and subtract a half daily range" is what this indicator does? To me, it adds the Full ADR (not half) to the current low and draws a HIGH line, then subtracts the ADR from the current high and draws a LOW line. You can easily measure this at market open, or any time during the day actually, using the MT4 crosshairs pointer. Depending on which way price is moving, 1 of those lines will move either up or down until it reaches the current high or low. As stated previously, the dotted lines then change to solid line to indicate that the ADR has been met. Regards, E.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Erebus: I thought the same but when i seen finn's explaination I just took it to be different from what he wanted. Ozmacca: so you did, I never seen your post so kudos to you. Forexhard: From what i can see your indi is different from what I and Ozmacca are after. thanks anyway. Vantage your pic with the trades I'm trying to show on this thread

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks kraven

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Erebus I got it all wrong? Being weekend I haven't seen the indicator working in realtime and may have misinterpreted the picture at the end of friday. If it works like your very clear explanation: Wonderful! Then it really IS the indy I have been lookong for. Thanks for your time. This is ForexFactory when it's best Kind regards, Finn

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi,guys, can someone go into detail how the ADR indi works.....would be much appreciated,thank you

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks for the efforts kraven. Looks really simple and effective system. will try it for sure.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Glad you like the idea pedrosa, as i said earlier, if your current trading isn't meeting your expectations then give this 100% for 2 weeks. Use daily and 1hr. it's fairly stress free. for ME the ADR indicator is the best i've come across. the info in the top right shows various values..ADR, todays range, has ADR been hit, high and low of today, target high low. on the chart itself it paints 2 faint lines (ADR high and low) the distance of the ADR, these are randomly placed at the top and bottom of current range (ADR distance apart). if price drops the lower ADR line drops with it until the top ADR hits the high of the day. the lines then stay in place and become solid and thick. the data window shows ADR has been hit and fills in relevent data. opersite happens if price rises....it's a really simple yet effect ADR indi (best i've found by far, i believe it's a specialised indi from an expensive course)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
just knocked up another quick chart chart. this time AU daily and hourly. hopefully you can see why i'd enter and the potential for good profits. the charts are current. if you look at the last pic you'll see the ADR has turned a solid red showing we have exceeded the ADR, now IF one of those candles RED candles had made a new high then reversed to me it would signal a high probability trade.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Kraven, thank you for this real simple approach. My Sunday testing session will be for your strategy...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
kraven said it best in his recent post, it really is the best ADR that I have found, and I believe that I am the one that introduced it here on FF, found it on a forgotten download site, yes, it is part of a system which I forget the name of. Here is a screen shot of it when ADR is reached, you really have to watch it develop the lines during the price action of the day. Measure as soon as you can from the broker open, from current low to projected high, and from current high to projected low, and you will see that they are the same; not until price begins a move will the line narrow until price is met high &amp; low. Good luck, E.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Erebus that was a nice trade in the pic, bottom candle that hit low ADR was a nice example of a reverse candle... i'm told the indi is used in a Steve Mauro stratergy (hence the SM on the indi)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Once again, another great share by Kraven. Thanks for taking the time post your system and sharing your thoughts!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
@ kraven, thank you for sharing. I use this mainly on daily charts, I`ll post if I find a decent entry that fits to the idea of this thread. And thanks Seneca_pilot, great post - true understanding of market context. Good trading to all. M.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Ah, that makes sense, since I did watch a Webinar or 2 of his, via CompassFX, got another 6 indicators if anyone interested, not sure what they all do... use at your own risk as they say

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Signed up just for this thread, so I will be watching and learning with interest. For the first time in ages, I cant wait to spend Sunday afternoon back testing! Thank you Kraven

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks for the share Erebus (and your right use them at your own risk) but remember what i said in post 39 about indicators ...i would like to keep this simple and true. No problems liamg, glad you and a few others like it. Remember there is no 'holy grail', there will be losses, also some of the best hrly trades happen after the ADR has been exceeded and a retracement is due.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks . Subscribed . Simple approach . Nice. mixter.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks for sharing this system kravin I have been going back through a few major currency pairs on the 1 hour just looking at the reversal candle and am amazed at how consistent it works .You may get the odd double bottom ( or top ) after the reverse candle but that is just further confirmation to reenter if you get stopped out .The whole approach makes sense from a supply demand perspective as well please keep sharing

--- 帖子 #66 ---
nice and clean method - well most likely it looks like a trigger. but combined with some s/r zones can be very powerfull keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #67 ---
thanks for the positives comments...I post here only to help others, so even if you take one thing away from this thread then your on a winner. here are 2 upto data random charts (USD/TRY lol)...one is the daily the other the hourly. What i'm trying to do in the hourly is to show the need to look for the ADR being hit or at the very least only trade a 'reverse candle' if it's at the current high or low for the day . Now i'm not trying to predict the high or low, i'm taking the reversal candle only if it's at the high or low of the day at that time. ***********forgot to add this....On the daily when the day closes after entry, if you move to BE...you'll have a few BE's, a few big wins but only a few, if any losses*************** good luck with your trading this week. be weiry of the small sunday candle and get involved, post some of your entries here.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
same principle applied to the GU 1hr....only if the reversal candle is at the current high or low of the day...the numbers are pips the move achieved at the max of the move for the day (ish). not saying you'd get them all as i said i'm not a fan of indi's but the yellow line is 100EMA..it's going up nicely at a good steady angle indicating an uptrend....I use it sometimes to increase my targets...e.g. in the pic it would keep me in Buy's longer and and Sell's shorter

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Really good point, if we use this awesome system with s/r and some volume knowledge it will be extremely effective.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Just to be clear... about the ADR Indicator posted in here, as shown by Purple arrow on chart, please watch the Price Action during the day, to learn what it can do for you. From the open, it will draw 2 dotted lines, 1 from the CURRENT Low to projected HIGH , the other from CURRENT High to projected LOW . When price moves during the day, obviously, the CURRENT High or Low will change, hence 1 of the lines will move at any one time during the day. IF the ADR is met, the line will go SOLID to indicate this, your trading action is up to you. I have shown another ADR indicator on this chart, all it does is show the ADR projected from the open, half up &amp; half down, sometimes, price is contained by this, but sometimes not. Good luck, E.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
has anyone has a WEEKLY ADR indicator??

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hello Please can you tell me when you say daily high or low you mean previous day high or low or high low based on ADR? Is ADR high and low used in daily charts or just 1hr? Thanks for your great thread Mohamed

--- 帖子 #73 ---
adler i mean if we get a reverse candle and it's at a high of that day then enter it...however if the pair has made a high, then drops and then comes up to make a lower high but we have a reversal candle then be cautious. same for lows. now if we have a good run that day and the ADR is hit and we get a reversal candle then it's more likely that the big move of the day is over and we are about to reverse. adler the ADR has to be used on the 1hr, it'll not work on the daily as it the average daily range. If anyone has an AWR...average weekly range then please post hope this helps

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Is there any statistical proof that price is likely to reverse if it exceeds the ADR? If not (and I don't believe there is) why worry about it? I think you have happened onto a good, simple and predictive price pattern. I'm also afraid it will wind up being lost in a maze of indicators. The tweaking squad has moved in.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
bill if all the indicators start appearing i'll ditch the thread. i want to keep this simple, but logical.that's why i brought it to forumers attention. there probably isn't any proof, just common sense. if the ADR is 100 and we get a reverse candle at 150 then i'd be confident of a good move..remember 2 or 3 pairs, two or three good trades each week = . but as you said why worry, if you go through the GU 1hr for xxxx days you'll be hard pushed to find one or two clear loosers.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Entered short couple hours ago. Will keep the trade open until a new reversal candle or no newer lows.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
i tend to wait until sundays/monday mornings over...gapping,order fills etc. i'll start tomorrow but good luck if you exit at the first 'wrong' candle then you may want to wait until it's closed and then if the next candle breaks it's high exit. as sometimes its a small pullback, then continues down again...but profit taking is an individual call, hell 20pips is good at this time.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Kraven Thanks for sharing. In the attached EU 1H chart, please ref to the circled area - would that be a valid short entry (resulting in SL)? Thanks for clarifying

--- 帖子 #79 ---
as i stated i wouldn't trade yet. here's my EU1hr and no trade there., note even though you'd think all 1hr charts would look the same they don't, note your second candle today finished down (red), mine up (green)

--- 帖子 #80 ---
sorry msood, ignore the last pic... the area you circled would be a failed sell, but i'd be looking to exit at the top of the 'breakout candle' for about -15pips......simply the power of the previous move would have made me cautious...beside the move at the bottom could have netted you 70pips

--- 帖子 #81 ---
ok as i've said i wouldn't trade this early in the week but.. UChf (sell on break) AU, EU, GU (buy on break)...don't take them all though very early in week.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
EJ as well, missed it..although it's struggling to get past the open

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thanks - just verifying if i understood the rules correctly. Yes, seems quite promising...

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks Kraven. You are making a great thread.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Great short setups on most xx/jpy pairs

--- 帖子 #86 ---
First thing it’s a Dead Stop Reversal / tweezer bottom + on a strong support zone.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Similar setup on Eur/Gbp as well. Regards, Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #88 ---
eu H1 buy @ 1.3095 stop sell at 1.3052 (hedge instead of SL) hoping it will get to 1.3135 TP (entry + range of last up candle)

--- 帖子 #89 ---
SL executed; incidently, it also appears to be a valid short sig?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
A Failed Setup, kraven - your comment on this? Regards, Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Failed setups do happen - no system is perfect; I suppose you just take the next one; in this case, a short around 1.3054 which looks more promising.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
There is no such thing as the holy grail - there will always be losses in any system. As long as your winners are bigger or more than your losses, then no need to worry.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thanks Kraven. Is it possible ot set any kind of alert for a possble entry to avoid watching all the pairs through out the day?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Let's order a indicator on mql4.com Need to technical project. Vito, Italia

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Understood though we share the same chart, we may not have the same view, hence looking for kraven's call on this if i went wrong. Peace Te-Wies

--- 帖子 #96 ---
i cant see a signal here, or a qualified candle to enter short ??

--- 帖子 #97 ---
hello all. see a few entered even though i repeated several times that i wouldn't enter this early in the week. we are kind of looking for failed trends here, so we need a trend to develop. Sako put it best when he said "The whole approach makes sense from a supply demand perspective ", so we need to see some first. so far EJ has shown the best entries.. 3 bar run then rejection off the open, this bar closed a higher red, enter for a run of 30 or so, then we have another reverse candle that failed. I still would have not entered it's too early in the week. Try to be patient guys, pick the best ones.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
a quite a few of low grade entries NU, EU etc..(they are not at high or lows of the day) i took these..

--- 帖子 #99 ---
it's hard to post and trade....i posted 2 pics of AU, 1 should have been GU

--- 帖子 #100 ---
closed both trades..GU at open, AU at 100ema, just to get some points on board

just a note: see how the EU is under the open, and GU is above...if EU had an entry candle SELL like the GU did i would have chosen the EU, as getting past the open is sometimes a bitch (good S/R point). hence why i closed GU when it hit the open. plus 100ema is sloping more. back to bed zzzzzz

Hello all. Have been following this thread with interest since Kraven kindly started it. I trade 1m charts using another strategy -- it is difficult to trade 1m and be an active participant in another thread. Several people have indicated a desire to see a signals generator for this strategy so that not so much time in front of the screen is needed. With some reservations, I have put one together and you will find it attached. My reservation is caused by the need to service it for a few days as people learn to use it. I have put several of these indis together for other threads, and sometimes there is no end to the system crash problems. Let me explain. This indi was put together yesterday, and compiled under MT4 Build 409. If you do not have Build 409 or higher, it may crash your system. You should be ruinning the latest build (409) anyway, so check your MT4 build if you have system crash problems. To check your build, go to the help/about pulldown and you will see the build number. If it is not Build 409 or higher, you should go to your brokers site and upgrade your platform. Here are some notes on the indicator: 1. REQUIRES MT4 BUILD 409 or HIGHER; 2. It implements to "reverse candle" provisions of the strategy; 3. lookBack is the number of candles that the indi looks back from the current to find a local high/low. I have the default set to 5 candles. Experiment with it -- if you would like to have the default value changed, ask me nicely and I will change it. 4. A "Green" line is a long signal, and a "Red" line is a short signal. Yellow is no signal. 5. Up to two "Time Windiws" are provided for in the external parameters. This allows you to request signals only during periods in which you trade. They are entered as start/stop hour only -- no minutes. 5. Audio alerts and email alerts are provided for. That is it. I hope you find that it helps.

EasyRyder NICE JOB

--- 帖子 #105 ---
well i just looked and the charts and we have our typical move. we move 1 way then move back (see EJ, uchf, NU and EU now struggling with the open). unfortunately we didn't get a reversal candle at the start of the move...very close on most but not quite

--- 帖子 #106 ---
thanks for the effort EasyRyder. 1m...really ..i tried this one on a few different TF's, grabbing 10pips. but settled on a more relaxing 1hr and daily

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I am not trading your strategy on 1m -- it is my own hybrid strategy. I agree that your strategy works best on 30m and up.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
thanks for your effort and for the owner of this thread when i see this thread i was very happy because this is themethod i use from 1 month and we could make it beter together i saw your indicator it's good but as you have experince in programing i will give you some idea to make the signals better and for now try to make the look back 12 on 1 hr chart on gbp/usd you will see a good signals and from my 1 month experince i found that gbp/usd respect this candels the most waiing your replayes

--- 帖子 #109 ---
zelenko, you can make the lookBack 12 by setting it in the parameters box. Let me know of other suggested improvements. Thanks for your comments.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
yes i make it 12 so i wrote the previous post and before i say my improvement i want to know what is the criteria you choose in the indicator to give the signal exactly so i could till you what exactly to improve

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Kraven, Nice thread , easy system to pick up, about time someone came up with a no idi system even as a newby like me can follow without asking loads of questions. Do you trade full time and if so how are you doing with this. keep the pips up.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thanks Easyrider..excellent job..I see few false signals..is there any optimization to be done

--- 帖子 #113 ---
did any one sell the uro or the cable ???? i did

--- 帖子 #114 ---
It seems a valid setup on both...

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Very nice thread, clear and spot to the point. Thanks a lot kraven for the topic and the idea. Now, with all the respect and thanks to EasyRider for his work, and in spite of the absence of the code (ER: eventually it could have been possible helping you in some improvement), ... and just for fun in half an hour spare time (so: there is no option, nothing special, nor a time filter) ... and just as a visual aid (no "indicators" here around, right?): would you like this one instead? http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1328561450 Of course with a bit more time, one would eagerly add continuation bars control after a strong trend, or/and railroad stops... ... but time is money! Bye BL

--- 帖子 #116 ---
now we have better life and easy ryder that's very nice and thanks alot to kraven for sharing this mehod now i will share my idea first let's put names to the candeles i will say that the reversal from above ( sell signal ) we will name this candel as ((( falling of the roof )) and the other reverse ( buy ) :: we will name it (( kill the sellers )) hahahaahahaha nice names the one who learned me this method is the creator of this names now the basic rules up to now is - if a cadnel formed with a high higher than previous (( x )) candels and it's close came below the oben (( red candle or down candel )) then that's it we will sell when the low of the candel ( falling of the roof) break untill now there is no change the changes that i want to add and then if we could code it in an indicator: 1- we need to filter the candels it self 2- we need to modify the entry 3- we need to choose the best paires 1 - the candel : - not every candel with this criteria well hit the target &gt; some will hit stop ( we need to reduce this ones ) - i notice that it's better if either the falling or the kill came as a( bin par ) or as engulf - the range of the candel ( high to low ) most be taken into considration (n not every small candel meet the criteria we consider it a good trade )) - the pin bar may be ((red )) and cnsidered as (( buy )) signal (if it came with long tail and small body - support and resistance based on fractals :: if we combine this with us will give good signals waiting you replayes

--- 帖子 #117 ---
hi, could you explain it in a pic, than it is easier to understand for me, because my english is not so perfect thx

--- 帖子 #118 ---
explain which point exactly ??

--- 帖子 #119 ---
1 - the candel : - not every candel with this criteria well hit the target &gt; some will hit stop ( we need to reduce this ones ) - i notice that it's better if either the falling or the kill came as a( bin par ) or as engulf - the range of the candel ( high to low ) most be taken into considration (n not every small candel meet the criteria we consider it a good trade )) - the pin bar may be ((red )) and cnsidered as (( buy )) signal (if it came with long tail and small body - support and resistance based on fractals :: if we combine this with us will give good signals this part is not so clear for me thx

--- 帖子 #120 ---
this part is what i want to add to the original strategy of this thread please read the previuos pages and you will understand

--- 帖子 #121 ---
high guys if anyone sold the EU or GU i'd get out now for BE as it's consolidating and could break either way EJ looks good if you bought, move to BE if you sold AU (rail road tracks) i'd bail for a few pips as its consolidating a bit. wait for some movement and a good candle

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Please go back and read my earlier post. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...84#post5354784 Context is crucial to trading these bars. Please spend some time and go through some charts. Don't go to the highs and lows and see the beautiful bar and think you have the holy grail. Look at an hourly chart and go bar by bar and see all the failed bars. You must use these bars in the correct areas for them to be profitable. The key reversal bars do work but only in the right context. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
good shot, kraven

--- 帖子 #124 ---
wooo. some spikes on news. the AU has hit it's ADR in one 15m bar

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Oooo.... It Created a window for 38 Pips on M15 AU.

why?????????????

--- 帖子 #130 ---
i use another strategy of entry ( i will explain it later )) i enter from the half of the reversal candel ( the retest of the regection area )

--- 帖子 #131 ---
oh, lets try not confuse things here. i'm long NU and AU on daily as trend continuation..bed time

--- 帖子 #132 ---
good luck

--- 帖子 #133 ---
could you please put another inputs to you indicator 1- alert : true /false 2- alert file : file name ( because i want to add an annoying alert other than the meta trader alert when i am sleep ) 3- times to repeat the alert : numbers 1 2 3 ... etc (0 for endless repeat ) and thank you for you effort

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Very nice method Kraven. Will follow with interest.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi kraven! How do you see EURUSD just now? A technical setup but hardly a reversal. But a continuation then finnsol

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Dear Finnsol, A bit late but if you zoom out a little and draw a sloping line along those highs you'll see why it would be prudent not to go long off of that candle. See ya.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Chulmleigh You are right - but it was a nice "impulse"-candle. Thanks for your input. finnsol

--- 帖子 #138 ---
No worries. I am no grand-master mind you. Still very much learning. Bye.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Glad to see u back again kraven ! And thanks for this great thread..... Now time to learn again : Possible nice set up in USD/CHF? http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...icture1-28.jpg Note: Price still develop candle when i upload this pic.....

--- 帖子 #140 ---
hello RoelsMajor, that would be a set-up however you need to consider how much that candle has already moved, so do you think it's due a pullback again soon? have alook at your charts on 1hr, we have barely moved 50pips on most pairs in the last 24hr...very consolidated, so take that into account and go for small TP's or move to BE quickly. it keeps getting mentioned on here, pick your trades...if there's reasons not to enter then don't. my EJ daily pending kicked in.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
we have a fed speaker now, i hate these. speakers can go on for hrs and say one word and the market goes nuts. I bought the AU 1hr earlier (not a good entry as it's mid range) and sold GU 1hr, but i'll get out if i feel the need and take small profit too if i don't see moves

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Yeah..I'm stopping for the day. Never know what Bernanke is going to say next. Good trading to all Paul.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
just got back. small stop on GU hit -9, AU hit tp of +25 RR1:1(already in AU daily, plus it was a mid range bet although we are in a nice uptrend) and i took half my lot on EJ as it hit +100 (sl to BE). Roels it looks like if you took the UChf it would have worked out ok after all.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
The AU is +50pips, i'm happy to move too BE NU has just went to positive again, will put SL to .83200

--- 帖子 #145 ---
i bought UChf at the last candle but it doesn't look good. for me trade seemed fine, past ADR, some good support. however the 100ma trend was flat on 1hr and daily. SL in place so i'm leaving it...lunch time.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
now in EJ sell. still in UChf *market's tired and so am i. closed UChf for a small loss and EJ for BE, going out for a beer and wings.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thanks for the tip kraven..... The ADR low was hit then.....RR 1:1.....57 pips..... http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...icture1-28.jpg http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...or/cacheRR.jpg

--- 帖子 #148 ---
what do you consider to qualify a reversal candle ? how many pips max/min must the body/wicks be ?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Honestly, Vantage yours is one of the few chart with colorful lines that makes money consistently i guess i can say its PA between the lines because have been following and trading your style with good success. No disrespect to the thread owner, just my way of appreciating my boss when i see him on the fx street.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
hello, can anybody tell me, what the adr make? and what i must look of the adr? thx steve

--- 帖子 #151 ---
hi guy's this trend look good and sensible i have been following the trend and intrested. what do you guy's think of gbpusd 1 huor if finish in red is good for short as of DEAD END thanks Tiwa

--- 帖子 #152 ---
i think market just answer you

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Yes ooo and thanks for your reply BRADU

--- 帖子 #154 ---
wich is your entry? steve

--- 帖子 #155 ---
my entry was 1.59305 and exit @ 1.58722

--- 帖子 #156 ---
why 1.5930? it is above the red candle? Have you any pairs on the radar?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
not at the moment stevee

--- 帖子 #158 ---
euro-jpy look at this!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Tiwa looks like you got some pips, although your entry was strange. Steve EJ is mid todays trend, not saying it wouldn't work out for you though. on dailies My EJ missed my tp 102.45 by milli pips would have given 170pip (took half at 50 though) AU is 70pips up and my TP is actualy where todays ADR marker is. NU is now 45 pips up...tempted to take all and quit for the week....and spend more time in bed

--- 帖子 #160 ---
kraven thanks am talking about the gbpusd on hourly chart i took it when the high finished as red hammer

--- 帖子 #161 ---
adr . I do not point yet what I must pay attention there to, whom I make entry?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I think you must have wrote your entry down wrong. still should have got a decent return

--- 帖子 #163 ---
i just took this trade short is it ok or not Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #164 ---
at the bottom (break of) the top red candle was your sell entry point.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
gbd-usd entry 1.5880. a good trade

--- 帖子 #166 ---
yes kraven and this is the result thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge) 64 pips profit

--- 帖子 #167 ---
hello kraven, this is my picture from the e/j 1 hour with adr. what is wrong? steve

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Just saw now, thanks for those kind words. The lines have gone from 1hr (well OK fozzy rsi, 8 lwma and now the great adr indi are there) but 5 min still a techni colour wonderland. Back to thread, looking at 1hr also helping Mrs V learn a lot and she wrote the book on if it ain't broke don't fix it. On that note Mrs V didn't take the earlier sell on gu at the top as it was right on the RN. The 1hr lower high re-entry sell around 5780 was a great set up. If your adr levels are different I use 5.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
To all, on gbpusd alone today with two trade i took over 100 pips in profit which is good i have a little experience in forex added to kraven system very good it gave me more confidence to be honest my friend gave or introduce me to this style yesterday thanks to all more to Kraven

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Forgot to add Mrs V exited perhaps too early, adr just above Y's lows and it looks at least like a 15/85 trade and 5800 may fail see see 85 area hit. Sorry scratch that we are right on London close reversal time, lost track of time.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
well all please take note of today....this is what i'm trying to tell people to look for.....a nice run up or down then look for a reversal candle.....if you look at UChf we are fairly flat, no real direct trend, so we avoid it. NU, AU (which i took and bailed for 30), GU all had some form of a multiple candle move up, then reversal. I got out of EJ daily, and AU daily (when i took 1hr revse) but ended up with zero on NU. still not too shabby. Steve there is nothing wrong with your ADR indi, it just hasn't hit the range yet.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
tut..tut Vantage tell Mrs V to get them squiggles off. (nice little blog you have) i see S&amp;P said nice things about the GBP and it dropped. maybe a reversal again?? **i keep getting pm's asking 'when do i trade', like most systems i like london and NY, but any time will do just look for nice runs. right now a lot of the long term trends are to the upside and the 1hr trend has dropped, so hopefully we'll see a correction.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
signal on 1 hr eu, buy.....

--- 帖子 #174 ---
A few more time on hand, and here is another version of the reversal indicator. The first one, as somebody told me by PM, had some problems in real time because of recalculations during the current bars when ticks are still incoming. So now it prints (eventual arrows or symbols) on bars only AFTER the closure of the previous bar. (So: arrow comes out just in the moment you must place the order. Eventually, anyway, good for backesting). There are a couple of more fancy things. A "star" is printed on the opposite side of the bar if the reversal happens after a "trend" has been formed according to kraven's specifications (&gt;= 3 bars of the same color). This warns the user that the "reversal" could also be a "continuation". Second, railroad stops are shown. Please note the weird thing happening when two consecutive railroads are formed: they get connected. But please, don't ask me, in a very spared spare time to look for aestetic things! Enjoy or simply trash! BL

--- 帖子 #175 ---
thanks BL will try it out.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
This was Re-Entry Trade

--- 帖子 #177 ---
So Kraven..... What are pairs work best for "this true" strategy? Just need 2-3 pairs. I am sure I can't trade all pairs, right? As long as the thread established, you have traded AU, NU, EJ, EU and some more..... Could i ask you or someone make the road map data just for pairs that most actively trade base on this Saxo-Bank structure. Take a look at this picture (just for info only): http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...icture1-29.jpg 1. EU (28%) 2. UJ (14%) 3. GU (9%) 4. AU (6%) 5. UCad (5%) 6. UChf (4%) Thanks

--- 帖子 #178 ---
on the daily's you can look at a lot of pairs (flick through them 20mins before close and put in pending orders). AU, NU, UChf, EJ, GU, EU are my norm. i originaly just traded the GU and EU on 1hr, lowest spreads , the pair moves the most in my waking hrs, lots of volume. although they tend to be corrilated some what a few pips difference could give an entry. however, as i don't have any particular indi's/set-ups etc that differs daily trades from 1hr trades i just hit the 1hr button and watch all the pairs above now. shrunk and fitted side by side.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Great work BL.....Thanks.....I Love the railroad/deadstop and continuation trend icon.....easier to find the kraven criteria..... OK Lets it be for just 2 pairs (EU and GU)....GU doing well today... http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...ajor/Test2.jpg

--- 帖子 #180 ---
hello, kraven. Must I make with the some settings? low is with 1.3187. And high with 1.3349. Could be my settings are not right. Yesterday I also had the same values. And high I cannot see the upper one in 1 hour status. Have I understood this so properly whom a candle meets high or low, then the line of the address changes? thx steve

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Add one more pair to portfolio: Now 3 pairs (EU, GU, and AU) and and that are enough!.....AU doing well too! http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...or/Test2AU.jpg

Hi Steve, I prefer the attached ADRindicator now. Try it finnsol

--- 帖子 #183 ---
RM I actualy entered this trade around the time i typed the my last message, but i moved my stop to BE as i was going to bed, shame. hope you had better luck as it was a nice run. remember all, you don't have to bail at the next wrong candle, it was only a suggestion. if you have a different exit tactic then great. A lot of the time i just set my TP to a previous high or 100ma etc..

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi guy's how do you see audusd on daily chart i think it what setting a pending order for @ around 1.07601 or what do you guy's think of this

Hi Finsol I have attached your ini adr hi low but i carn get it to work (does not show on my screen) do you need a ex4 as well to get it to work? all other inis i have attached have the yellow diamond ini mq4 and a ex4, hope i have explained ok. Cheers

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Personally wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. Better chance of a turn in 1.1000/1080 area the highs from 2011. Uptrend is just too strong to justify the trade (even if my squiggles are saying we have divergence on D chart) on my risk assessment.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Sorry about that. Here are both. Eventually you can open the *.mq4 file in the MetaEditor and compile it. Voila - the ex4 appears finnsol

--- 帖子 #193 ---
did anyone get into the EJ 1hr before? it was a mid range trade so more care is needed, however it's working a treat. i missed it but sold the GU bailed at the weekly open. As for AU daily it is an entry. however we are also in a trend continuation. so personnaly i'd like to see a few consecutive green candles to go against this....this is just my opinion of how i'd trade this, no crystal ball, it could plummet for all we know.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
hi kraven you're right is better to wait

--- 帖子 #195 ---
looks like i pulled out way to early on the EJ daily yesterday, never mind i got some good pips on the board from what has been for me a slow week. i find on the hourly i only need 3 or 4 good trades per weeks. today i missed the EJ trade (moved 80 pips and still going up, reversal soon?), moved my early GU bet this morning to BE far to early and missed a nice big move but i got +17 on the GU sell earlier (still going down). and just entered NU sell (i'll watch close as i don't want a loss i'll settle for 10pips if i have too)

--- 帖子 #196 ---
woo that was a fast drop on NU...any news?? took half at 100ma and BE on rest....seems sensible, EJ STILL going up

--- 帖子 #197 ---
just got out of NU. hit weekly open. can't find any news and it appears it's just consolidating at the moment on the 1hr plus the strong trend is still definately up. av. around 12pips on that one.

Hi Kraven, Can this strategy be implemented for binary options trading which have expiries below 1 hour usually?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi finnsol (or any other, for what it matters), thanks for this indicator, which, anyway, is something completely different from the one posted before on this thread. After a (very short, admittedly) search around, I am quite confused bacause I even found different and conflicting definitions of the ADR indicator (where ADR stays for "Average Daily Range"; there is even an "Advance Decline Ratio" which of course has nothing to do with what we're speaking about). Normally the ADRs I found are calculated as a single line, in different ways but always quite consistent with the idea of averaging somehow the range of daily movements of price over certain periods/different modalities. Now, my problem is: both the indi's presented here have two levels. Second: your's and the previous are NOT the same thing, just based on the parameters: one requires an ATR period, the other a certain n. of days... So, please: can you at least indicate some reference for home study? Bye BL

--- 帖子 #203 ---
No idea bobby.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi BL, You don't need to be confused. The parameter in both indicators is the same thing. eintAdrDays = ATRperiod A common value is 14. 22 corresponds to a month. I prefer 40. finnsol

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Been paper trading and I am now convinced Going live as of Tuesday, and will post results here. Thanks again Kraven. Paul.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Believe or not, but the best exit tactic in the world is 1:1 RR , i have been searching the best exit tactics for years and can't find the best one except this 1:1 RR.....This Business like marathon not a sprint, even 25-50 pips a day is very good pips for me..... But let say we have an alternative exit tactic design for this strategy: Based on your TP criteria (TP generally the lenght of the reversal candle) If price reach 1:1 RR move to BE..... If price reach 1:2 RR move to 1:1..... If price reach 1:3 RR move to 1:2..... It would be nice if @betterlife add this visual TP feature in the reversal bars indie.....

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Depends on time frame doesn't it? not to mention position size? Say, what if, see the chart, your system gives signals that are MUCH better than 1:1 Risk / Reward? Sure, depending on stops, this may have had 1 loss, but surely catch the move with re-entry at arrow? And then, what if you then added a small position every time it broke the previous day's high... and / or the previous position was at risk free level? No, I didn't trade this, but sure watching for the reversal on some pairs, a run like this will make a good profit, just saying, more than one way to skin a cat....

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I am updating my post above Yes depend on time frame but like kraven criteria stick to Daily or just H1.... And kraven criteria has re-entry trade, but after all i think totally different way if you say it on this alternative trade exit, why should we open another trade in the same pair when the trade still develop?

yesterday was an example got to take the take the perfect candle with same pips high and the second one reverses.... enter the break of reverse candle. second scenario with high success rate is reverse candle with long wick and closes below the open.. Cheers to this startergy.. am loving it.....

--- 帖子 #215 ---
i just typed out a big reply to some of the posts and deleted it by mistake... anyway Erebus i sometimes trade the way you say (on dailys) getting in, staying in, and then adding on pullbacks. but this takes nerves of steel when it's real money. look a NU daily at the bottom of current uptrend, i got in on that. but when you see 80pips turn into less then 50pips and your profit starts to drop it's tuff to hang in. if i had stopped in and added to continuations i'd have enough pips for the year . i find a lot of traders forget they can take bits of profit off there lot size. so i often do this now. RoelsMajor lets not forget a very simple move. after 10pips move the SL from above the reversal candle to above the breakout candle (just something i like to do now and again) some nice comments on the thread about this simple system. glad people like it. remember you can be choosey with your choices of entry (i keep saying this as its true) I'm still in EJ (no one posted, did anyone else enter?)

Hello RM I'm struggling with this trade. if anything the blue candle needs to be broken to the upside. I've actualy missed some legit daily sells on GU, AU and NU (although this is in a strong channel)...all against a strong trend though...but i've took the GU

--- 帖子 #220 ---
tiwa you seem to keep missing the entry. it was below the red pi at the top of the range (reversal candle) see my last pic...you seem to keep entering on a continuation. PT i'm going to take half at 102.80...take more at 102.51 (then move sl to 102.80)...let rest go. ***look at my pic, i actualy got in late and got a good price.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
thanks kraven

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Yes kraven, there is strong sell trend (GU, AU, and EU) from yesterday (on my broker) and the dead stop (for buy) on the EU yesterday.....i cancel the trade as now it is not a valid signal...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
This is my perspective on EJ, am i right? http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...Experience.jpg

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Waiting reversal AU, EU &amp; GU.........

--- 帖子 #225 ---
yes i'm late getting in GU. AU looks good to me for next trade. here's what i see in your pic RM

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hello Tiwa, I see you are using the Quik trailing. What is your experience with it? Do you have a manual for it to share?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
RM if you look at live pic to the one i took of EJ you will see I was right to wait as it was rejected at 103:00.

au possible reversal.....

--- 帖子 #230 ---
yes if it goes above 720 then possible trade setup.... what you think?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Possible, Yes! but if this set-up failed it will possible goes to ADR Low today.....

--- 帖子 #232 ---

not a proper buy imho. buy candle body way too big + did not reach a big enough lower low before reversing. i would prefer a smaller body and larger wick with a bit further down move (lower low),.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Anyone watching audusd 1 hour

--- 帖子 #239 ---
at this time ,no. i have make 70 pips with this pair today.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
i long Audusd at 0900h but turned out to be a false signal Gbpusd which i long at 0800h turned in some pips though now looking to short Gbpusd at 1.5820

--- 帖子 #241 ---
there was no signal on AU.. long on EJ at 8:00GMT that moved +20 same on NU that went +18 long on UChf thats going now 45+ on EU false at 8:00 -17, another mid range at 9:00 72+ still going and on GU at 7:00 at +50, and a sell at 10:00 a 40+ and still going ...hope some of you are in some of these?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
hi kraven, for the UChf long position, there wasn't much of a trend development other than the long red bar just before reversal candle. does that mean trend development is not as important as a good reversal candle? thanks for sharing your system!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
really a simple system to trade.. if you are patient enough to take the right one. My favourite is: AU EU GU EJ today i made hefty pips shorting GU and AU. I just need to fine tune my risk reward ratio and the lot sizes to gain on a longer run. Kudos for the creator.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
not really Omd, you have to take the hole picture into account. on UChf we have been in a flat 50pip consolidation for about 72hrs, which we all know will break eventualy but which way is a mystery. however the trade itself was at a low for the day, it was turned at 9500. plus in order to break the reverse candle we would then have moved above todays open. I personnaly took GU, bailed at 1.5782 (+36). it was at a daily high, came off a recent trend line (last 2 peaks) also at 58500 and if broken would have to move below weekly open.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
the EJ trade has netted me about +50pips in total...i've took most of my lot and locked in profits for the remainder by putting SL above the top of current candle. this plus GU profit and i'm done for now. I'm still in GU daily sell from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
If you got in any of the latter trades you should have made enough for the week lol. you should have locked in some profits or at least moved SL's above/below last candles.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
thanks kraven! i see what you mean about the consolidation of UChf...i took the GU too, entered at about the same price and have closed half earlier and moved SL to BE. will be closing shop soon for the day. should be a nice 70+pip from GU today for the earlier long position and current short position.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Omd i keep repeating myself but if you get a few of these right per week it's all you need, most days you can trade it one way then the other. even if the trade doesn't work out and you use some cautious tactic (moving sl to breakout candle bottom, then to BE) you can often minimize losses...that then maximizes your gains.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I just moved GU daily SL to above todays open (sl is about -15) i 'm looking at AU (before i nap)..it's stopped at 06500 and is still in a overall up trend

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Here also a h1 chart! Nice setups

--- 帖子 #251 ---
yah, i'm perfectly happy to make a few steady pips a week just one more questioni forgot to ask just now, hope it's not too stupid (I'm a newbie): why is it important to "move above today's open"?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Its an important area (just 1 of many) that is likely to be defended. So you can look to trade the reaction to these important areas.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
0k AU trade worked out, i'm out for +15 (it was a set and forget trade...i went for a snooze) Omg the open is a strong SR line...think about it as the market either being positive or negative for the day.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Omg you can download pivots indi here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=108544 it has an adjustable start time so you can change to midnight GMT (in need depending on your platforms start time) which is a good general rule of thumb. Has pivots (no surprise there ) but also days open prev days high/low and a few other nice options). Cheers Kraven Mrs V warming nicely to this way of assessing trades. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
No problem, glad she likes it. But dump your indi's as V says it's nice to have open, previous high/low (forget about pivots and camilla's etc). i have just recently put a weekly one on too, although i'd love a weekly ADR. **I have a seperate enhancement too the way i trade but i need a coder, if one is reading this and like what he see's can he pm me. cheers

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Really gained huge pips this week, using this wonderful and everlasting method as it is based on pure price action. below is a beauty no one could have missed this run on GU i hr chart

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hello everybody, I hope everybody of you made some good pips this week. I would like to ask if anybody possibly considered (and perhaps did) a long trade after the break of the bullish engulfing candle in the hourly this morning (@ 1, 3276 - see arrow) ? The break out failed ... and I would like to know if this was anyhow foreseeable, because I have the impression that most of the trades took short trades today .... Have a good weekend you all! Take care Dortmunder

--- 帖子 #258 ---
You must read all thread for find this clue.....see post #25, #37, #98, #174 for just quick references.....there is no clue like "bullish engulfing candle or doji or morning star glory" here.....but it just a few rule based on reversal candle and trend made by kraven.....keep it simple mate! A chart on Friday is always nice to study: EU http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...ndofWeekEU.jpg GU http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...ndofWeekGU.jpg AU http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...ndofWeekAU.jpg

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Something that always be a concern The best exit tactic in the world is 1:1 RR http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...or/cacheRR.jpg http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...Major/ttt3.jpg But let say we have an alternative exit tactic design for this strategy: Based on your TP criteria TP generally the lenght of the reversal candle 1.If we get opposite signal after new reversal candle (signal) then exit after opposite signal bar form or your SL hit..... 2.If after 10pips move the SL from above the reversal candle to above the breakout candle..... (If i take a 'mid range trade' i'm more ready to jump to BE then if i took a trade from the top of a range....post#261). http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...sMajor/kkk.gif Update based on post #261 3. Target TP at recent Lows-Highs, Open line, and plus others (see ADR indie). http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...ndofWeekGU.jpg Anyone who have better idea for the exit? Note:It would be nice if @betterlife add this visual TP feature in the reversal bars indie.....

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Dortmunder you are right it was a trade, i mentioned it before as a loss. there will be losses, it's not perfect. nothing is in this game. Adding indi's etc will keep you out of as many good trades as bad (...i've ranted about my thoughts on indicators already on this thread). That's why i look at 6 pairs so i can choose the entries. Roels is right, keep it simple. there was some nice trades today, using this method it was impossible to loose if you took them. they was even 2 good +25 pip trades (EU and EJ) just before close. IF (and it's a big if) you get into every reverse candle (someone called it a KRC 'kravens reversal candle' ) i believe you would still make a good profit.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
RoelsM every exit should be different, as every chart is different. i target recent lows, highs, Open lines plus others. some of my charts and posts are 'base line proposals', what i look for most of the time. If i take a 'mid range trade' i'm more ready to jump to BE then if i took a trade from the top of a range....I have what you posted in mind but this should be adaptable. if i see a strategy that says SL 20 TP 40 alarm bells ring telling me that it hasn't been thought out and isn't sustainable.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thanks kraven. I will update my proposal exit tactics #259 based on your thought.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Nice system with congestion free charts, profit with less stress and more profit for more screen time! Thanks Kraven for the wonderful system. I demo traded the system with great success, shall implement on my live account from the start of the week n post trades here....thanks again for every one contributing to this thread.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Roels, I see you've become a fan of my little indi! Nice to see that even these very fast and dirty implementations can be useful! Maybe a little vouch? Nice trades here around. Congratulations to all! Bye BL

--- 帖子 #265 ---
A little indie for anyone else, but for me this is the big indie that help me much on this strategy.....An indie that created specially for a spesific strategy is worth much.....so strategy first than indie for that help so much.....One or two indies could play important rule for trade beside capability limit of my eyes.... And.....i would give you a vouch....but how i can vouch u? I don't have capability to do it just yet....

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Can you share with us some examples of your trading method?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Has anyone automated this yet?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
hi, i like your setup i'm going to put some hours of this weekend to code to MT4 EA. will post here soon... great community

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I wasn't in the buy (or Mrs V either) but it was for me a difficult one to avoid. The whole 3250 area had formed a bit of a base over the prev couple of days. Perhaps it was a reasonably big candle for the time of day, but most likely just one of those things. What I would say as we all know you cannot control the market only your reaction to what it gives you. It gave a failed buy but then a classic lower high to sell when the next candle closed. Other than that the D chart is struggling to go higher and there was another clue thats not part of this thread. Finally after a 600 pip move up you'll get these failed higher moves at the end of a run.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I have taken several SR lines off but this is my current D chart. The none thread clue perhaps 2 dojis and Thurs high never tested and big sell divergence on squiggly lines (sorry Kraven for none thread bits).

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thanks for your reply, kraven! With - 17 the loss was quite comfortable I think. I had my SL at 1,3235, so I suffered a bigger loss. When and why did you give up this long trade or better, when did you discover that it was a failure and covered your trade ? thx

--- 帖子 #272 ---
still crude EA... will open position if price break through reversal candle... i put MinHeight Parameter here, so this EA will not open any order if KRC height is below minimum height. i tried at USDCAD and the result is almost break even... do i miss something? what to do with ADR? feel free to give suggestion on improvement. i will try to make it better.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
...like to have this EA without any TP and SL. THANKS!!!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi Kraven, Nice thread you have here.It is simply KISS and i love it.Going througth my charts in anticipation for the coming week fx battle,i see that the underlisted pairs fit your trading principles and will like to share them with mates here.All are weekly though. GBPUSD NZDUSD AUDUSD EURAUD AUDCHF AUDCAD I will appreciate your thinking on these pairs. Sincerely, Adeshina.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
redbox good luck with the EA, personaly i don't think the results will match manualy trading, unless you can create an EA that can be put on different pairs, communicate with each other as too which pair looks best, take into account news and different forms of SR and adjust SL, lot size and TP in accordence to them. that said it could still end up profitable. look at RoelMajors post on RR (on last page) Ifebaba94 don't realy want to start looking at other pairs...i will say AU and NZ are in a good uptrend and could be due a pullback. For me GU has bounced off 100ma, is in a down trend and it could be the start of the downtrend continuing...for me GU, which is good as i'm in on a daily GU sell ; )

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi redbox, thanks for your efforts. I think ADR or another range indicator are quite crucial for any of these implementations. Nevertheless: "feel free to give suggestion on improvement" is quite hard with just an .ex4. Of course you're perfectly free to keep sources for yourself, and I personally have too bad experiences about sharing publicly software on these forums. So, I'm absolutely not pushing you in one direction or the other. But you should be aware that the way of undisclosed sources and partially shared results is the way of the lonely researcher! Take just care of one thing. Looking at your pick, it seems like trades are entered far away from where they should, namely at the break of the setup candle. This might be due to too high spread modeled. You're aware of the intricacies of MT4 testing, isn't it? Don't trust any results of your backtesting till you've gone down the whole tick data modeling... Just my thoughts, and in the moment busy with other implementations to be able to go deeper in this one. Bye BL

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi BL..... I think about your simple indie and I still have concerns about RailRoad or Dead Stop that not macthing kravens suggestion: " A railroad or dead stop usually a pip or two off"..... and i think it must be limited only for just two bars on H1..... So I do not use dead or railroad visual stop from your indie anymore until you have some time to fix it..... Anyway, Thanks for your effort.....hope the good news soon.....

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Redbox maybe you could try it only with longer term trend, so buys or sells only personaly i'd like to know how successful are high/low entries, as opposed to taking mid range entry......i prefer high/low entries but i maybe cutting myself short.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
[quote=kraven;5376247] there was some nice trades today, using this method it was impossible to loose if you took them. they was even 2 good +25 pip trades (EU and EJ) just before close. quote] Did anyone get in and stay in???? up 70 and 60 pips respectively. if you stayed in you have your pips for the week

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Well...roll on Tuesday! I looking forward to having a crack at it

--- 帖子 #281 ---
[quote=kraven;5378265] Hi Kraven, I like your system and have just studied it through the weekend. Could you please clarifiy the signal for EU today? Is it a buy sinal when the market just opening in gap this morning or the reversal bar last Friday? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
i posted last week how i like to see sunday gone before i look to trade. the comments i made were a quote from last friday. i seen a signal candle had formed the hr before close, if you had got in you could have bailed before market closed for the week with +25...if you kept it open it would be 70 or 60 on the first candle today. our second candle today on a few pairs were entries, but i like the market to settle on Sunday before i trade.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I took these 2 trades, was my understanding of this method correct? Please suggest. Thanks

--- 帖子 #284 ---
hi guy's anyone looking at eurusd i hour

--- 帖子 #285 ---
steevebalmer i return your pm have u got it

--- 帖子 #286 ---
The system looks very attractive for me as I love to catch reversal movements. I will backtest and post the results here))

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi Kraven, Thanks very much for the clarification. I hate to stay in over the weekend due to my very bad experience of gap opening on Monday against my position eventhough I have locked my profit it still automatically turned my trade from profit into a huge loss. It was Nov 28 2011. Anyway, could you also share your money management in line with this strategy? Do you apply any rule of maximum pips in risk or just put your SL at the high/low of the breakout candle?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
did anyone short the EurJpy, reversal candle at 0900h? wasn't very sure, would have prefered a longer upper wick or shorter body but i'm demo trading, so decided to test it. i entered short at 102.98, SL-103.19, TP1-102.76, TP2-102.54 (if i manage to close half at TP1, will move the rest to BE)

--- 帖子 #289 ---
interesting... since my current trading style is correlation... i have an indicator that calculating major pair &amp; show their performance, in short, yes, i can make this EA reading other pair information... so what is your criteria when choosing which pair is best one?... (but the EA only will tested on forward test mode) sorry, i don't understand... what is SR?...

--- 帖子 #290 ---
you must wait of a reversel candle, dont good set up this moment.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hi steve, if you have time, do u mind explaining why the EJ is not considered reversal candle coz i thought it was thanks!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
yes &amp; yes. this backtesting using "control point" mode + visualization, just only to make sure it works correctly. and because i test on off-market time, it has spread 2x than normal trading time. i did test on tick data modeling at that abnormal spread. the result is almost break even, in very long run, it still produce loss *maybe due spread*.&amp; i only test at USDCAD because i only have this pair history... thank you for your suggestion about sharing the code, but i think we will not be lonely in this big community i think it's better to not share it public because will do more harm than good. i know you are a coder too, feel free to discuss or share about EA programming with me.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
i would consider it a reversal. we have a noticeable trend up then a reversal. i'd be looking to move SL to above past candles or to BE...the object is always not to loose, not just win! Redbox: SR = support and resistance

--- 帖子 #294 ---
thanks kraven! i did move SL to BE although i have not closed any profit as the movement looked weak. i'm a defensive trader too, always more important not to lose money i have closed the position at about 10pip profit - looks like it might be turning around. meanwhile, have just entered AU - long 1.2329 did you take that trade?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Vnfx i know what your saying with gapping but its and odds game. when a gap appears it more often then not closes (people often just trade these) also i have noticed that if the last candle of the week is up the market often opens gapping higher. you'd have to remover your SL though. As for R:R we've covered that, RoelMajor did to. simply it's not a science. for e.g. early in the week i'm a lot more cautious, i'll move SL to BE quicker, i'll down size my position quicker etc...if by Thursday i'm in profit i maybe more liberal with my trading.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
looks like EJ's going in the right direction too me....looks like a good trade, try moving SL to above the previous candle close or the current candle if it's ran for a while. but 10 pips is 10pips... AU long?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
we have a couple of good example of what i look for on the screens right now... the last trade on EJ...trend going up (mixed candles, but a nice up trend today), a reversal candle, an entry, a drop. GU 3 candles ago has a reversal candle but the previous 4 candles have been flat, consolidating. lost it's trend. battle between buyers and seller. so i'll give this a miss....not saying this won't shoot up for a huge profit, if i knew that then i'd obviously bet the house on it. i just trade as i see it.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
oops. i mean EurAud. there was a doji at 1200h but anyway it was a false signal. Yep the EJ is heading down now, too bad for me but yes 10pip is better than nothing

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Been late at the game today coz there were so much works must be done! Quick analyze for three pairs: EU : 1 signal : would have been -9 (after 10 pips gain) and there was bullish continuation warning sign But, the signal was wrong signal generated by indie. It was not a new high of the day reversal . So there was no signal from EU until now GU : 2 signal : would have been -20 (after 10 pips gain) and would have been lost 11 pips (sl) But, one of the signal (2nd signal) was wrong signal generated by the indie. It was not the new high of the day reversal . AU : 1 signal : would have been -10 pips (after 13 pips gain) and there was a bullish continuation warning sign All signals were mid-range signals based on the ADR target projection. AU : Break of the Pullback due to strong trend? Note: the reversal Indie have default 5 bars look back.....will remove this until BL have better implementation.....

--- 帖子 #300 ---
ok it's been a few hrs since this post and it shows what i mean..GU has went against the candle. EJ however, the clearest signal so far for me has went over +70

--- 帖子 #301 ---
could this be the day the markets continue there downward long term trend? EU failed 100ma on daily, now under 100/200 on 1hr GU bounced off weekly 100ma, failed to break daily 200, now under 100 and 200 on 1hr just thinking out loud.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I'm with you there on the general idea. Now all we have to do is navigate the ups and downs!!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
i'm a candle late but decided to enter NU long (went back to entry position)..signal candle (in mid range) we have R at 83500, but support from MA's and fridays high..only a small bet.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
V if i see monthly, weekly and daily all heading down i like to jump into an hrly sell candle and hold, often adding to it.....at the moment daily is still up.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
just got in..have sold AU (trend continue)TP 1.06500 still in GU daily short NU went up to 15+pips but came down and stopped out at BE.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Still looking this way.... Moved to BE on AU at .06970 so it's a no loose situation

--- 帖子 #307 ---
been sitting here with figure on button...just took some profit at +30 (get some pips on the board for the week)

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Does anyone have results in excel format?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
AU just fill the gap of Monday opening. I'm thinking of seting TP at the ADR low.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Kraven Thanks for sharing your trades. The reversal and continuation set ups are pretty easy to spot but the trade management comes with practice. I see that you might have a lot of break evens and small gains with your conservative approach but it takes only a few trades that run to S/R levels (like the AUD/USD hopefully) that can make your week. Please keep posting, I'm following closely. Charlie

--- 帖子 #311 ---
No problems Charlie. your right in what you say. Example, i just took 30pips on AU, not ground breaking, but the ADR is around 90, so i just got 33.3% of the daily move. i just got into the NU, i have SL at the bottom of THIS candle, so my SL is only 6pips...if i bailed now that RR 1:1 *****there's a lot to be said for RR1:1 lol....stopped out one more go with EJ coming up.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
i just entered eur/usd short m15 sl 6 pips usd/chf long m15 sl 4 pips

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Is it not EU long and UChf short signal on 1hr chart? Wish you good luck

--- 帖子 #314 ---
after the EJ H1 bar at 0600h (which could be reversal candle or pull-back bar), i queued both a long and short position to see which way it would break out. eventually it broke upwards and i entered a long position at 102.62. SL-102.38 TP1-102.86 TP2-103.10 have just closed half at TP1 n moved SL to BE. kraven: is this the right approach for trend continuation? not so sure i recognise the candles for that. thanks.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
i think there is also a dead stop for EA at 0700h...enter long at around 1.2317 ?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
closed EJ H1 long position at TP2. profit 36pip.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
it appears to be a buy on the eu daily ?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Any one looks for trading these pairs?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Yes, i'm already short on EJ, let see how it will process.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I'm still waiting for breakout through the last bar.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
i'm short on the EJ too.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
i entered EJ short, SL is above 1hr trend line and yesterdays high (worth the extra few pips)

--- 帖子 #323 ---
EJ hit my SL yours? looks like you placed it a little higher...how do u know when to deviate from the "rules"?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
when you cut your SL short you run a greater risk of an early bath...if i put my SL under the reversal candle on the NU bet 50pips could have been had

--- 帖子 #325 ---
As i said above trend line off last previous highs on 1hr + yesterdays high...if you feel you have too add a few more pips to your SL then do so, it could be the difference of winning or loosing all for 3 or 4 pips. as i said before, tradings is about looking at bigger picture..for example GU, EU and EJ are pretty corrilated. if GU is hitting and rebounding off Yesterdays low, the other 2 are likely to move back with it (see now),. **NU short now in this time tight SL, just above this candle and MA

--- 帖子 #326 ---
we have a lot of resistance on a few pairs, weekly open, yesterday low, todays open all getting hit on different pairs...expect a bumpy ride.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
EJ bounce of weekly open AU off daily open GU off Yesterday low are causing all pairs to recoil.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I've just moved SL to BE for both EJ and NU. So free trade now!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
i see what u mean...thks! i took the AU short...

--- 帖子 #330 ---
closed NU for +20 pips at weekly open... took half for 19pips (though it was 20) on EJ..SL to BE

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Kraven i entered eur/usd on m15 at 10:30 GMT with a sl of 6 pips gained 60 pips! Someone wished me goodluck! I had my luck thnx to kraven And entered long again on the opposite signal Greets Closed long +20 EDIT: Total eur usd m15 80 pips! Live trading Went short on opposite signal+15 pips Total 95pips

--- 帖子 #332 ---
what's the significance of daily and weekly open?

it's the open of the week, where the markets began at the start of the week. so it's a good SR area. and it made for a good TP target....daily open, yesterday high/low, weekly open, last week high/low....look at your pairs today, move to a smaller TF and see which one's have been influencal today...UChf has reversed off open, NU of weekly open, EU yesterday low etc.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Kraven, Thanks for sharing your system, I love my charts absolutely naked..... I´m only testing this week EUR/USD but I have much better results on M15 (Frankfurt/London session): Monday: -40 pips H1, +25 pips M15 Tuesday: no trades H1, +75 pips M15 What is your experience in this TF? Thank you

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thats what i'm saying! I'm Also winning on eur/usd m15! Today was à good day!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
has anyone done backtesting of this method? thanks.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hey Caillou, how you doing? I have mentioned on here somewhere that the reversal candle will work on all TF, by it's very construct it's a strong reverse of a move. I am not disputing you will get some real good moves on lower TF's for low SL, i noticed more dead stop moves too, however the lower the TF the choppier the move. i have used 15m consistantly in the past. also trading can be confusing if you trade on too many TF's hence i settled on 1hr and daily particulary for the start of this thread, so follows can get used to the system then find there own way

--- 帖子 #338 ---
this is one reason i didn't want to discuss smaller TF's...basicaly the ammount of entries...i just quickly knocked this up from UChf...times these entries from 4 or 6 pairs (i get questions and pm's about pairs i've never heard of lol) and the thread would be sooo confusing. however if you understand the actualy essence of what i'm trying to do here then KRC can be used on any TF....hell i even missed the red inverted hammer entry on chart. if you do do lower TF's stick to 1 - 3 mixed pairs. *we could even have a EU, GU, AU, UChf 15min only day. lol

--- 帖子 #339 ---
i find when trading small TF's 1-30min that 100 and 200ma's have less meaning. so i like to be aware of what the other higher TF's are doing. for a quick visual i use this indi. basicaly tells you what direction the current candle is doing on all TF's....so if 4hr, daily and weekly are green i'm more into a KRC at the end of a drop....hope it helps

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thanks Kraven, For sure, if I follow just 15M I will do on 2-3 pairs, more than enough. Early days but looks promising. Thank you

--- 帖子 #341 ---
for you 15min fans there was a buy entry on UChf, all candles Green..candle came nicely/retestesd .92000....nice trade

--- 帖子 #342 ---
has anyone got a nice simple bar indicator (like the one i posted), that will give trend directions on all timeframes?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hey Kraven, Thank you for explaining this system. I find it very simple and effective. I can make trades now without having to look at 2-4 indicators. I have been trading on my demo account for about 2 weeks with great success. I was curious to what your money management strategy is. Thanks again. Being wrong is acceptable. But staying wrong is totally unacceptable. Being wrong isn’t a choice, but staying wrong is. To play any game successfully, you have to have some skill, an edge, but beyond that it is money management. Good traders manage the downside; they don’t worry the upside. - MARK MINNERVINI

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I have one, but you aint getting it!!! Never respond to me! Not nice Thnx for the system though

--- 帖子 #345 ---
pathetic

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hey FourX this is why i tend to avoid opening threads, this guy posted how he made 95pips today because of me. and because I have a life to get on with and never responded to something he wrote he won't share an indi..i know i can ban him from responding on a thread but i wish there was a way these guys could get banned from reading/seeing a thread? anyway i've blocked this Robst3r prick out.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
totally agree

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Maybe move to a blog, and PM the address to members that are interested.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
well im glad you started this thread kraven, ive learnt some new tricks. keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #350 ---
liamg4x a blog seems hard work lol, also i posted this for people who are struggling. it's simple and pure. B Kid we have covered MM here a few times....well given some tips, as all trades are different nothing is in stone nore should they be.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
here's one

--- 帖子 #352 ---
thanks Marnic. this is actualy the one i deleted by accident

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hello Kraven, I just wanted to drop by and say thanks for opening this great thread. It's really helped me to get back to the basics of PA and trend-lines as well as the importance of only taking the best possible trades and filtering out the so-so ones to reduce over-trading. Thanks again and keep up the great work!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
[quote=kraven;5356920] If anyone has an AWR...average weekly range then please post Kravin, Well, it took a bit of digging, but I manged to find a AWR indi. The info it provides is pretty good. Easy enough to throw on a couple of lines on a chart to mark the levels. Hope it helps. Great thread by the way. Turning my trading around using it. Thanks much... Cliff Location on FF: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...nge+calculator

--- 帖子 #355 ---
the first re-entry you highlighted, would that not actually be a sell signal given the red pullback candle ? why would you not enter a sell there ? does the reversal candle need to have a wick or body of at least a certain length ?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
hey kraven, thanks for the explanation i sort of see what you mean...will observe more and take the opens, highs, lows into greater consideration...boy, there's just so much to look at/think about sometimes...tough for a newbie to absorb, rather daunting... you ignore the pricks, the rest of us fully appreciate what you're doing

--- 帖子 #357 ---
thanks for the comments guys. glad this all helps. CCE thanks for the indi. i had a PM about 15min trading and MM. here's what i do... when with trend i put SL a pip or two above KRC, or above any near obvious barrier (remember the difference between a win and a loss can be a pip, so if a barrier 'e.g. the open line' is 2 pips from the end of your candle add a few pips to your SL) against the trend go with the top of the breakout candle, this will often lead to a SL of as little as 6pips as for profit....well that's upto you, if we all new when to stay in and when to get out we'd be rich....look for exit SR area's, take note of ADR (if it's 90 and your up 30pips then you've got 33% of an average day in your bank, not bad) and don't be frightend to reduce your lots as you go. .....remember practice on the 1hr first!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
hope this answers your questions

--- 帖子 #359 ---
OMD if your just starting stick to 1hr. add open, yesterdays high/low. keep an eye on big RN's like 1000, 1100, 1200 etc..and use 200 and 100ma......that should do for now. with more experience add SR area's, weekly open,high,low and trend lines.....keep it simple at first

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi marnic i carnt open the trend bar do i need a ex4 file as weel as the mq4 file, nomally i have to put them both in the experts to get it to work ,hope i have explained this ok

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Save the .mq4 file in the experts\indicators folder. The mq4 file will create/compile the ex4 file when you launch metatrader.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
yes i'm only testing H1. some more questions: is there an indicator for open, high, lows or i just eyeball them? what do i do with the 200/100ma? i've added them. thanks!

--- 帖子 #363 ---
use 100 and 200 for SR. here's an indi...make sure you alter it for your broker e.g. +1 switch everything off ...no pivots etc. just have open switched on, and yesterdays high low

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Thank you very much, kraven, for this nice system. I am going to test it on the H1 time-frame. Thank you also to the other contributors for the important notes and the indicators posted in the thread. TH

--- 帖子 #365 ---
IT is not my strong point but if anyone wants an indi just for yesterday high/low then I have one. Just don't know how to put it in here.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Kraven, I am still trying to differentiate reverse trend and continuation. What kind of confirmation do you use before you enter to make sure the reverse candle entry won't turn as continuation? Rabhni

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Great strategy Kraven. Thanks for sharing. Short EU just filled now. Confluence with 100 and 200emas acting as resistance? Let's see! I hope to contribute to and learn from this thread. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Following this system and thread with interest. Thanks Kraven for sharing. Do you all avoid trading during important news releases or not?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
How does that always happen!!??? I saw both Cable and EURUSD setups and took EURUSD. Cable went straight down, EURUSD is heading for SL!!! Typical!! Lol!!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
happens to me too btw, i assume you took the 0700h bar as the reversal candle but doesn't the reversal candle have to be right after a green bar? in this case, the 0600h candle is already red. anyone else care to comment? kraven? thanks.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
So far so Good NZD/USD M15 (10:00am GMT) Kraven ...and others Go ahead pls BBF

--- 帖子 #372 ---
If you want to keep an eye on the opening price levels for the different sessions, this indicator is a handy tool. I have 2 instances of it on my charts in different colours. One shows the London open and the other shows the NY open.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
blackfeet as i mentioned before by it's very nature if you get a KRC on 1hr you will get it on the 15min....but with lower SL. look between your entry and 1hr too see. OMD and Gt3rs your in a strange position where a generaly corrilated pairs are going in oppersite direction, tip: try looking at Eur/Gbp to see which is stronger and go with that one RicO i don't avoid news as it can work for you as well..with this system i see a lot of people sell off or buy because of news causing a KRC, they might know something we don't?...i will lessen/adjust stops though Rabhni good question...the answer: i don't...if we knew it was going to be a continuation then we'd all be rich...i just play it as i see it....however, this is were moving your SL to BE or to the top of the breakout candle helps...also looking at where the higher trends are going too, i feel i have a better chance of it being a KRC if it's going with the long term trend. hope that's all the questions answered..... both EU and GU entry should have made you money if you stayed in and kept SL to the KRC (7am on EU), i would have moved SL to above 6am red candle....now i'd have taken some profit...even though GU was a cleaner move i'd have possibly entered EU as weekly, monthly and sentiment is still against the Euro.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
you guys should be loaded by now..... did we have news?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Blackfoot on the NU you have had 3 signals in a short time. on the 1hr we have had one (hence a good one for newbies)..this is where you have to sort out the good from the bad (even though all would have given RR:1:1 or more). good luck.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi, Kraven First and above all I THANK YOU QUITE A LOT.... You definitively made me understant the famous (never explained) PA ! Second, as we consider the TFs : the shorter the more work to do but : * the SL is smaller, * Less boring, * I don't agree : some times there is a M15 signal without a H1 (for instance : NZD/USD 12:30 pm GMT) and finally, the M15 signals come sooner (for instance I got the 10:00am GMT at 10:14:59 and not at 10:59:59). But, eventually, this is not for the (bad) pleasure of arguing as I repeat I thank you for this very good thread and for all the time you spend explaining and showing. Regards BBF

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I don't agree : some times there is a M15 signal without a H1 (for instance : NZD/USD 12:30 pm GMT) you misunderstand black foot.......yes there ARE 15m signals but not 1hr....However there are not many, not always, but not many 1hr without 15m... as the top of the 1hr pullsback it often (not always) forms a KRC on 15 or 5min ...hence my previous post to you about 3 signals on 15m to 1 on the hrly.....but at the top of the hrly you should see a 5m or 15min entry form first (most times) *****come on guys someone must have made a load of pips on that move?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Missed it..had to go out There will be more

--- 帖子 #379 ---
More than thousand words..... http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...bruary2012.jpg Short brief today: EU 1 signal sell at the top (risk 30pips.....would have 90 pips).....still moving short..... GU 2 signals, one sell mid-range ( risk 22.....would have 36 pips) one buy pull back (risk 22pips.....would have 26 pips). Moving short..... AU classic example sell at the ADR top (risk 30.....would have 28 pips).....still moving short.....

--- 帖子 #380 ---
hi guys - great thread...very interesting ideas being put forward. Can I ask one question. Im dont yet fully understand how the ADR indcator works or is created (put together) Could somebody please enlighten me or point me in the direction of a good book on the matter?!? ANy help would be much appreciated Thanks and good luck

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Nice simple strategy!! It seems this works well on any session, but I'm starting to find it is damn deadly accurate during London. Now having to rearrange my schedule so I can take advantage of the open. I'm actually having greater success using the 30 min. TF and combining this with Steve W. (NBT methods). The two combined, make this pretty manageable for TP targets, in order to catch some decent runs. Thanks for sharing this Kraven. Although I've used something similar to this in the past, for some reason this clicks better for me...lol, go figure. So far, a +117 pip day with 3 trades still running.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
well i had to get in on something... looked at biggest movers on 1hr UChf and EU, switched to 15min.....waited till pullback had finish.....waited for a KRC to go back with 1hr trend (it was EU that give me one at 14:15)...exit half for 30...SL to BE for rest TP at .30360..

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Understood! strong trend and a little pullback! But my ADR Low for EU is about 1.30570.....Very near to the bottom range.....

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi to everyone, Still testing EUR/USD H1 and M15: -H1: +30 pips -M15: +55 pips and floating -13 pips Really amazing. PD: MM extremelly simple, SL= High for Sell/Low for Buy of Reversal Candle, TP=SL, R:R=1:1 Thank you Kraven

--- 帖子 #385 ---
RoelsM heres a pic of 1hr and 15min....we got a very strong move down on EU then a pullback, i fancied it to continue as it was very strong but first we need a pullback (see white line on 1hr pic)....then we need an entry (see candle on 15min....simple) i looked for one on UChf too but got none. Yes we are near ADR, but that is the average...remember possibly 50% of the days go past this...if it goes past by 30ips my tp is hit for 50ish..concern is .30500 area(moved TP to 3038)

--- 帖子 #386 ---
forgot to attach pic.. caillou...nice ; )

--- 帖子 #387 ---
It's supposed to give you the average the pair has moved over a given number of days (14)...so add all 14 days up divide by 14 = ADR...least i hope it works that way

--- 帖子 #388 ---
UPDATE -H1: +30 pips -M15: +55-20+12: 47 pips

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hello, Anyone taking the EU long on the break H1?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Caillou please attach your charts,thanks

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Sure. Here you go......

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Cheers Caillou

--- 帖子 #393 ---
well i bailed the EU entry for 40pips (av. 35)..speakers in 1hr. and i only got in one trade today so want something....although still in GU daily short from beginning of thread, i missed my 150pip TP (50%) by 2 pips yesterday

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi Kaven, Does histo indicator below your chart repaint? Thanks

--- 帖子 #395 ---
it's not a histo indicator, one of the guy's here created it to signal KRC. it's on the thread.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Would an A/U long be a valid trade right now on the 1hr chart?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Is there a trading room for this on skype or some other medium ?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Do some of you only to trade this method in the direction of the trend, or does everyone take trades counter trend as well?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I'm doing a back test for my own benefit (to assure myself) on GU. I have the feeling that perhaps a 1:1 for Counter Trend and 1:2 for with Trend. But by it's nature this method is supposed to be taking advantage of Reversal situations so there should be CT trades taken.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
The main reversal candle entries aren't with the trend or against it. They are swing trades. Re-entries are obviously with the trend.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
i think it's a valid signal but turned out to be false. i find that this system works best after the london market opens (0700h). hope this helps

--- 帖子 #402 ---
@ kraven. I presume what has just happened on EUR invalidates the setup?? We had a reversal candle, but then the next candle broke down below it:

--- 帖子 #403 ---
A/U maybe not a signal to the letter of law,as the pinbar that printed the low did not change colour on closing?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
BJ1 posted that qn about AU a couple of hours ago. he's referring to the reversal candle at 0300h, not the one at 0600h. i agree the 0600h candle is not a reversal candle on account of colour.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
entered long on GU (1.5689) and EJ H1 (102.45) based on reversal candle at 0700h although the candle bodies are pretty long. let's see how it goes...

--- 帖子 #406 ---
sorry , I agree with you then Omd,it would have possibly been a signal but it did not break the high by a couple of pips?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
sorry kraven, but it hasnt answered my question.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
not too sure about you guys, but iam finding it difficult to spot signals on the 1hr eu chart. nothing for the past 4 days

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hello. 07:00 GMT yesterday. Turned out to be plum. I missed it though as I tend to wait till London opening and am just testing this strategy. Cheers

--- 帖子 #410 ---
There will always be anomolies beacuse of different brokers.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Yeah, yesterday's deal on EU turned out to be a cracker! Whatfx - if you don't see any signals, you don't trade. It really is that simple!! Not having a position is having a position. I'm happy to wait a week for a signal. With proper position sizing, you only need a couple of trades a WEEK. So be patient! It's a key ingredient in your makeup as a trader

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi. I've done some back-testing on GU H1 and am having trouble with chart saving. I know it is really simple but if anyone can just tell me which type of chart I am to save on MT4 I would really appreciate it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Think I've got it...we'll see.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Ok. Here goes! GBP/USD H1 6th Jan 2012 to 30th Jan 2012 35 set ups 3 Not Triggered (NT) Total Pips +305 Assumed all trades taken without any other reference than KRC All trades taken immediately on KRC breakout All stops at top or bottom of KRC All Profit or Loss taken at 1:1 or at competing KRC Spread not accounted for so BE is probably a loss Sundays ignored Continuation swings not taken Notes (1)Probably triggered but perhaps taken loss and Dead Stop. Counted as -49 pips (2)Perhaps lower low would have invalidated signal. Counted as -34 (3)Can’t tell what might of happened so left out (4)Took 16 hours (5)19 hours to entry. Counted as cancelled If today gets any more boring I might take a look at something else

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Thank you Chulmleigh. If you get time, could you do the same for E/U? Many thanks, Paul.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Yeah, I want to for my own benefit anyway and as F all is going on at the mo I probably will. Have randomly begun GBP/AUD as I want to follow several pairs anyway. I will edit the post to include that continuation swings are not added in but they should be considered though on trading this system. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I had a buy stop on Cable, but have cancelled now due to ranging action.....

--- 帖子 #418 ---
seems wise.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Are you still holding the EJ position?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Possible Cable and Swissy anyone at end of this candle?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Chum,be better, if you were to include timeframe, may be able to agree or disagee then

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Yeah, sorry. H1

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Well, we'll have time to see if it looks on.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Can someone please explain what is the logic here to determine a reversal bar?? Thx

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Go back to the first posts. That is the basic criteria though you might want other filters/opportunities.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Don't like cable for reasons mentioned above, and also the reversal candle has a large upper wick. Swissy is a dead stop, so could be a nice play, although it has a long lower wick...... It's worth mentioning that dead stops can be played in the opposite direction as a trend continuation.......................

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I've taken both 1:1.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Ok. Here’s another one GBP/AUD H1 6th Jan 2012 to 30th Jan 2012 33 set ups 4 Not Triggered (NT) Total Pips +181 Assumed all trades taken without any other reference than KRC All trades taken immediately on KRC breakout All stops at top or bottom of KRC All Profit or Loss taken at 1:1 or at competing KRC Spread not accounted for so BE is probably a loss Notes (1)Plenty of warning to get out sooner (2)Took 26 hours (3)Cancelled order due to weekend coming (4)Probably would not have closed on that competing KRC as only a little spinner (5)See above. Probably would not have taken it (6)No way would I have taken a 105 pip SL (7)Closed at end of week, but would have got out sooner I’ll do EUR/USD next

--- 帖子 #429 ---
If EURUSD can break above the London open price, then it should be good for the Swissy short.................

--- 帖子 #430 ---
TP hit on Swissy, Cable needs a push but I'll move to BE in 7 mins

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Well done. Battle going on around the London open price on EURUSD. London defending shorts I wonder......................?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I'd class both of those deals as B grade set ups BTW. Would be interesting to hear Kraven's comments on all this....................

--- 帖子 #433 ---
You're probably right. But TP hit on Cable too. Awaiting another sign. Cheers.............

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Was swissy a trade?.......the reversal candle was an inside bar on my platform, it had'nt posted a new high?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
And cable was ranging for hours,so looks basically like a breakout trade to me, but well done!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Was your entry on cable above the whole range? [safest IMHO] or above the reversal candle [risky IMHO]? EUR longs winning out for now - pushing above the London open.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Swissy was a "dead stop" as kraven has termed them.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
No, it was a Dead Stop by the rule. On full zoom looks the same to me. Anyhoo, it turned out alright.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Sorry, answered at the same time.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
My trade on usd/chf

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Are you still in?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Sorry Gt3rs, didn't see that you'd asked me a question. I had a pending order at the break of the KRC. I understand the risk. I have been back testing and have found that I must take all situations if it is to pay. I am seeking 1:1 against the trend and 2:1 with. I was also aware that the whole market had been bumping about and so a change was in the offing. If you look at Cable M15 there was a rejection of price below the lower edge of the range. But I was playing the H1 KRC breakout. I can spend all day not trading and if you look out across the pairs then you will find more reasons not to get involved than reasons for. Anyway. I am trialling this method alongside my other tactic. Cheers EDIT: ps a break of range for me means a retest and so is at odds with this method anyhoo.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Yes, now is let the profit run and set the SS to the BE.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
ps what does IMHO mean?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
i have take the krc on the mt 4 .but is dont go?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Which KRC?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi, i can't understand what is the correct settings for the 1) TimeZoneOfData and 2) TimeZoneOfSession of the ADR indicator. If anyone can help. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Oh, I see. I won't be using it. I don't think that you need an indicator for this. Ironically Kraven started out not wanting any clutter. Sorry I can't help you perhaps it has a bug. I suppose you might as well download it again and see.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
You did the right thing. I work on the basis that I'll lose more waiting for the run, but it still makes me feel a little green when I see it carry on way past. No matter. I'll try to pick it up on a pull back. Good luck

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi, I have followed this system from the beginning and i found some stuff i want share with all "True Trading Tactics" followers. I noticed differences between two brokers in the EURUSD pair 4TF. I understand the causes of such diferences. But what astonished me was to happen in a time frame so high as 4TF. However these differences are enough to spoil the strategy, as you can see the images attached (Same cross and time). Regards http://www.forexfactory.com/eurusd4h...0-%20FXPRO.gif

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Wise words..patients has just given me 100pips on GU...30pips on UChf (bailed at open doh!) if traders want to jump in and out of the action then try scalping..

--- 帖子 #455 ---
i only took GU tp now as where at the weekly open and .5800 and about 50pips over ADR or i'd still be in

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Do you let every trade run? Or do ever close early. I ask because I have (yet again) got TP well before the end of run. Its ok, but I do need to let the profits run, but I am very fearful of losing what I have. EDIT: the answer is in the thread. bye

--- 帖子 #457 ---
However, it touched already the 61.8 Fibo, so i think it´ll be a rebound of some kind.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Never use 4hr for something like this, some brokers candles start at different times, eg my 4hr candle might have 1 hr left, yours may have 3hrs depending on broker time difference however 1hr should be the same to a couple of pips

--- 帖子 #459 ---
actualy the GU was easy for me, big candles up or down are, i just moved SL to the bottom of every finished candle until it hit the weekly open.....hell, i should have done the same on UChf as i would have took profit now at +70 (at .9200 and 100ma) although the EJ could give you +100 pips the KRC of 50pips was a bit big for me.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
please don't start bring fibs in etc...as next we'll have people with stochs, Fozzy's and RSI etc.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
hy kraven, must i do the krc on the indicators,or on expert advisors? on mt 4? thx steve

--- 帖子 #462 ---

This system can be easily used as support of ur other systems, as well as trading it solely. For instance, I have weekly strategy and today i saved quite a sum of pips, because i exited shorts on GU,GJ,EJ,EU.. However, once they meet my criteria i wil re-enter,no matter if there is no Hourly reversal bar . I know, that according to rules no trade happened on EU, ..but... If u have clear signal on GU, UC ( Swiss is actually pegged with Eu, for time being) at least consider exit ur short.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Steve in your indicators, then you need to rebout your MT4 (switch off the on)

--- 帖子 #466 ---
is not a custom indicator, will be removed, on the yournal on mt 4!

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Okidoki, thanks!

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #469 ---
IMHO means "In My Humble Opinion"

--- 帖子 #470 ---
don't like to say to much about daily trades but my GU from the start of the thread got stopped at +65 (the one that missed my tp of 150 by 2 pips ). i had a NU entry today that closed half for 60 at 82800, then went and took the rest out for BE there could be EU and Uchf setting up ...shame it's nearly the end of the week.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
have you the adr or the krc indicator on your charts? steve

--- 帖子 #472 ---
gbh-aud, gbp-chf tf 1. what you mean guys?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
just got into EU..trend continuation...risky only want a few pips..more later on this

--- 帖子 #474 ---
and i'm out

--- 帖子 #475 ---
ok dust has settled...i took this trade because of reasons on chart, plus spread only 1pip, this is important because of small TP...actualy it was RR 1:1 for +22pips..... NOTE, this pic is taking from my demo account as i've closed my other account now (keeps stoping???) and i'm now mucking around

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi, this is a really nice strategy Kraven, i really appreciate it but i have a question, as a daily chart trader make me understand why trading the 4hr is a no go area for you while the daily chart can be traded,as they both are large tf and different brokers candles also start at different times. So why do you prefer trading the the daily chart to 4hr? or do you place entries differently

--- 帖子 #477 ---
holy pips that's a good question. For this strategy I don't like trading on the 4hr simply because a mere 1hr broker difference can have a big inpact on the colour of a 4hr candle then a daily. i remember a long time ago trying a 4hr system and chatting to a guy in New Zealand, his 4hr chart looked like a completely different day to mine as his broker was 3hr different..it did have an impact on the daily too but not as dramatic.. idealy i'd pick the weekly or monthly for the big TF's to 'blur' any broker differences but the SL's a bitch, so the longest i go is daily

--- 帖子 #478 ---
sorry for the late reply...EJ garnered me about 60pips but the GU i took at the same time lose me 30pips but still gd enough for me

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks for the reply, Omd.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Would there have to be a significant move down (maybe two red candles before a reversal green) on EU for there to be a buy signal or would any of you take the green candle forming now (7:22am as I write in the UK)? One hour TF.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
thanks for the reply kraven, i was looking at my cable 4hr candles last night and actually i found good setups that had very few bad trades there, that's why i asked the question.So i guess it has alot to do with the brokers not the strategy

--- 帖子 #482 ---
If you insist on trading H4 with this strategy, I'd suggest you make sure your data feed has candles that start either at the London open or the NY open.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
hey guys, would you consider the GU and EU H1 candles at 0700h a dead stop signal for long position? do the lows have to be exactly the same price? in these 2 cases about 1 pip off. how reliable do you find dead stop signals? i seem to have hits and misses...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I'm not seeing anything I want to trade on those 2 pairs. Try to look for reasons to NOT get into the market, rather than desperately looking for trades. The reasons for entering the market should be overwhelmingly compelling before you execute an order.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
i get what you're saying...thanks

--- 帖子 #486 ---
ok folks. on eu daily we have a buy...

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Well spotted!! However with a near 200 pip SL, I'll stick to H1 entries! Could be useful for overall bias during the coming days though.......... Thanks

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Well said, with a 200 pip Sl, it´s a very risky entry.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
This is great keep up the great work, learnt something from this thread so its helped me. Thats what counts.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
****sorry guys,i've edited this post, i just got out of bed and took a look...the reason why it didn't show was because it was a red candle.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
didn't see what you wrote before you edited so don't understand what you're saying here...?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
i was explaining why i wouldn't have entered the EU dead stop, basicaly no trend before and it was realy hard to spot....if it's easy it's often good. I thought there had been an entry on GU and explained what made it good, but i was mistaken it wasn't even a KRC ( i just got up).

--- 帖子 #493 ---
heh i see

--- 帖子 #494 ---
i would

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Yeah, seems that it is rejecting .0750 so looks on for a test of the high which is a bit under 1:1. I am looking after my kid at the moment but she is asleep so I might get involved.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Unless we get a new low.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
We got a new low.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
can the UChf 1200h dead stop be used as a signal for downward trend continuation?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I'd say yes, but with the very strong caveat that this would be a B grade set up due to ranging action. But why trade B grade setups when you can WAIT for the A graders....................?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Well it's coming off of a Resistance area and off of the 100 MA and through the open price. Not a great swing mind. But you might consider it. I really should be doing something else so Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Are you in?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Speak to you all on Monday, bye.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Guys look to the beautiful red candle on eurusd 1h. Possible setup for a short entry.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
stevebalmer sorry long time i saw you're on so i decided to logon did you tried the software

--- 帖子 #505 ---
wich software you mean? at we ask? adr?

the quick trailling

--- 帖子 #507 ---
i know...as a newbie, that's one of the toughest lessons for me to learn...still training my patience...

--- 帖子 #508 ---
yes i demo-shorted it...

--- 帖子 #509 ---
tip on dead stops: don't always wait until the second candle finishes, enter on the break of the first candle. pics UChf and EU (couldn't resist the sell of the perfect pinbar of EU...remember a tight pinbar is only a couple of pips from being a KRC) ****got a pm about the actual entries below (red green lines). i just bailed early on both for +24 each..one hit todays open the other the trend line support.....i entered 1 trade on pin, the other was on a trendline and recent low area (nothing to do with KRC..just went on a whim)

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Friday H1: no trades M15: + 63 pips This week H1: - 10 pips M15: + 255 pips EUR/USD, London Session, every Reversal Candle.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Can you explain your MM on 15 min, do you trade 1:1 RR or more with BE and where you put your SL? Thanks

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi Caillou Are those pips minus the spread? Are orders used with allowance for the spread? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi. can you the MQL file. i think you can use ZigZag to filter the trend. thanks

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hey Kraven, nice thread I trade a similar way but with channels. Quick question do u think a trailing stop set a few pips above the last candle would maximize gains and take the tp guess work out, thanks.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
not really, I don't believe in anything fixed or trailing. each trade should be analyzed seperately. a great example is the GU on thursday. i put the SL behind the bottom of each closed candle going up. because these candles were were 34,67,60pips each by the time i moved the SL to the 3rd candle i was 50pips up. i've briefly looked at the 1hr entries this week from 7:00 til 21:00, done "KRC size SL/max profit" and gave my opinion.. EJ...22/115, 21/loss, 39/17 poor entry, 27/106, 48/140 EU...42/loss poor entry, 34/114+, 13/14 UChf..21/124 (ended the next day with dead stop) this dead stop was 21/100 NU...15/16, 20/55, 30/17 poor entry, 36/140 into next day. AU...34/never got stopped,could have ran 130 but another signal caused BE, 18/13, 25/78, 30/65 choose your entries and there's more then enough good entries on 1hr...even at RR1:1 and poor entries it's about +160, let the good ones run a bit and take out some of the poor entries you can treble this.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Sure. 1:1, no BE, SL at Low (for Buy) or High (for Sell) of Reversal Candle. Cheers

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Spread included, in M15 you need very small spreads , in my case 0.5 for EUR/USD

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Nice trading - can you post an M15 chart of one of them wwhen you have time. Thanks

--- 帖子 #519 ---
ndle did. hi kraven the first short entry you circled , appears not a valid one. the red candle did not reach a highest high, the previous bullish candle did, so the red candle would not be a reversal candle right ? so no entry there. similarly, the second entry, you waited for the second red candle to give you the signal. in this scenario how many red candles would you have waited before taking the signal, i.e. is there a limit to the number of candles you can wait ?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Thank you. I made back test for last week it was nice on 15 Min. Have you tried any another pair except EURUSD?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
it's a lot easier for me if you post the pic to your question. i get a lot of questions and try to answer then, but the time it's taking me to trawl through all my posts to find the right pic is getting to much. but to answer your question the first 2 circles are mearly where the trend line comes from....see the yellow trend line. however, the first one was not entries (hence i did not discuss them, it was there to highlight the TL), the second was but the first red candle didn't cause a KRC. as for the number of red candles before i decide the trade is no good depends on the chart conditions e.g. size of candles, size od SL, angle and size of trend, SR areas etc... the actual bet i discussed on the pic...basicaly a trend contionuation, using the trendline for my TP.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
It's interesting that Caillou's stats show better return on M15 than H1. I wonder if that is just a rogue week or will it turn out to be the norm.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
You have that in previous posts......

--- 帖子 #524 ---
No, not yet. Anyway if it works like this, you will only need 1-2 pairs.......

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Kraven was asking for an AWR and I noticed someone posted one while I was coding one for him. Here is my simple one. All it does is put dotted lines like the SM ADR and make them bold when it's exceeded. I also modified it to let you pick any TF you want: D1, W1, MN1, H1.... whatever, and your colors too. I'm learning to trade but I'm a pretty good coder and can help as long as it doesn't interfere with my trading. Edit: Fixed AvgRg to allow multiple instances.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
thanks Eric

--- 帖子 #527 ---
First of all, thumbs up to Kraven for sharing his method with us! Subscribed!! Second, i think that it will be nice if a coder amongst us will be able to make the SM ADR indi to keep the lines it draws for a certain number of days, because in the actual form it deletes them. I think it would be very useful for us to see how price action reacted to ADR low and high in the past. I'll upload the indi so there would be no confusion. Green pips to all!

--- 帖子 #528 ---
caillou i cant seem to see many signals on the 15m chart. not too sure where you are getting your signals from. a chart example here with your entries on the day, would be good.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Yes "Caillou", show us your Friday trade... + 63pips. Only this one to confirm when you entered/exited. What bar times ? Thanks for that. But at the end, saying "i made X pips" is not relevant. It is how much money you make that is. With 1 pip i can make a million dollar... But i must be very good, ok ? R:R of 1:1 - you must be over 50% of wining/losing trades to be profitable. That is what must be backtested for one year. I will after i am sure to understand where Caillou enters and exits. My 2 cents : - 1 hour is too much - The strategy has some bias : * when trend reverses around the end of the candle : last candle is for example down and makes a lowest low then rebounds a little bit there. The next candle doesn't make a lowest low and goes high. Trade missed. * when trend reverses at the begining of the candle it is easier to make a small lowest low for example then have a big time to go high. But then your are late in the trade since the bounce is almost one candle earlier. So the time your candle starts and ends has strong influence on trade entering or not. Shifting the one hour candle 30 minutes will have different results. Using 15minutes timeframe will give more bounces. But will give more false signals ? Must be backtested !

--- 帖子 #530 ---
As I said before, unfortunately this is one of the anomolies you get with different brokers.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I'm not trying to complicate things here, but how about scalping a few pips from "inside bars" while we wait for the next KRC? I'm looking at 15m time frame at the moment and may have a bash at this next week. What do you guys think? Paul. http://s15.postimage.org/9wpkhfkmv/inside.jpg

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Please post 391 or 468......

--- 帖子 #533 ---
No problem, but Blackfeet found a bug. Anyone who downloaded the AvgRg, please go back a page and download the new 1.1. This allows you to run more than one on a chart (which was the whole point), and it will hide the indicator if you go up to a TF higher than your selected TF. You know, if you're higher than D1, you probably don't want to see the D1 Hi and Lo.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I remember reading this but then forgot until I started re-reading the thread. Do you use this for other TFs? Like new high D1, highest of the week or month? And high/low of the day for M15 too?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
i look for some reasonable trend prior to the signal....even if its a mixture of colours....but obviously most will be the right colour for the trend direction..i try to aviod flat ranging area's but might act if i get a signal and a breakout of the range..common sense stuff, unfortunately you can't teach common sense. so to make it clear and easier i mentioned what i like too see the most, a signal at the highs or lows with a few candles the same colour prior.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Good Morning....8.30 AM here (GMT+7)....

RaidRoad Track for short stop GU at 4th Bar H1 with 10 pips risk.....waiting breakout 5th Bar for kick in!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
don't forget to keep one eye on the daily. that's how i started trading KRC's. i'm in UChf and EU (moved both to BE and took some for 70pips off EU as it hit 100ma)

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Yes kraven, thanks for remind me.....but i can't stand to hold open trade more than a day.....it just something that i can't discuss here.....something principal.....but i do look the Daily for trend.....

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I think this was asked before but not answered. Please tell me time zone of data and timezone of session settings? My broker is GMT+2 Thanks alot!

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Maybe a quiet day today because of holiday in US?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
With the gaps up in many pairs, I'm looking for a reversal bar at the current high of the day, with a view to trading all the way back down until the gap is filled. Trading from the current high or low of the day, I believe, is actually the edge of this strategy....................

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I'd be more concerned about news coming out of Greece today............

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Good Morning Everyone!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Please tell me that I am the only idiot who was looking elsewhere when EU and Swissy gave their signals. 1:1 in no time.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
no...you are not alone

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Oh well. It's early in the week. Good to know that the signals worked out eh?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I saw them, but didn't take either of them. Don't like trading against the gap........

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Yeah fair enough. Gaps can take a while to fill. I have been listening to you, by the way Gt3rs. I am primarily going to use the swings as confirmation of trend trading, but if the bounce has a round number in the area then it will have a good case for a trade for me. My own version of Grade A, Grade B. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi, Sorry, you are right, on Friday it was not 63 pips, it was 67...... In one of my previous post you have how I enter and I exit, just Kraven´s rules. Cheers

hey guys, i think it was a good entry here on gbpaud.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
It was as an afterthought, but I didn't get a KRC on my chart. The Doji was green not red. So not an official entry.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
It depends of your broker, on my broker the doji was red...

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Yeah, absolutely. By fine margins fortunes are made and lost etc etc. Hope you scored on it.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
yes you´re right... I´ve already changed the SS to BE and let run the profits.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Well I'm kicking myself for failing to look at EU and Swissy at 09:00 GMT. Got a little off of EJ. Gotta learn to let them run though. It is my weakest point and something I must master.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
There´s a lot of things we´ve got to improve, but look for USDZAR 1h. It´s a possible good setup for a long entry.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I am limiting myself to 6 pairs and the Rand isn't one of them. But thanks for the tip all the same. Cheers

--- 帖子 #561 ---
you wellcome

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hi mate, glad you're learning something - I am too!! Gaps can indeed take a while to fill sometimes, but equally, they fill very quickly sometimes........ I think the key thing which has got lost a bit in this thread is to try to trade from the high / low of the day. So, if you get a reversal candle and it's at the high or low of the day so far, your probability of a successful trade is greatly improved.... Looking for reversal candles now - and if we get them, I'll trade all the way back to the gap fill.......

--- 帖子 #563 ---
hi, which 6 pairs do you trade? and why? thanks

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I have no experience with EA's which I believe the KRC is. Can someone kindly give me some advice on what to do with it (apart from stick it where the sun don't shine lol).

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Thanks for the discussion... The information on this discussion quite interesting to understand the things about candles in the trade process.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Personally, I only trade the majors, plus one cross - EURJPY. However, with correlations etc, you may as well cut down to just one or two pairs. Trying to watch too many pairs = overtrading because of frustration at missing deals. And with many trades, you will find you are actually doubling your position in the first trade. For example, if you short EURUSD and then go long USDCHF, you have effectively doubled the size of your EURUSD deal. Always remember guys - correlations and money management........ 2 or 3 trades a week is plenty

--- 帖子 #567 ---
i agree with you...hence earlier, i took the EU trade but not the UChf, and the EJ... just entered AU H1 short at 1.0777 SL - 1.0797 TP1 - 1.0757

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks kraven for starting this thread. I took the EU long earlier this morning but got stopped out at BE+1. Maybe I was too anxious to move to BE after I was up 20+ pips. Now short AU and hope it goes down to the gap area. Trying not to be too hard up over that BE trade. Based on my own backtesting on EU and GU, sometimes it takes a couple of candles before the move starts, and this means that the trade will be in drawdown for at least a couple of hours. Obviously, though, the best moves are those that move in our favour immediately. I don't know the percentages, but psychologically BE is always better than the risk of a losing trade after having had pips on the table.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Sorry for taking so long. EU, AU, Swissy, NU, GU, EJ. I don't seek to trade them all, but if one doesn't give a signal another might. I don't have more than 2 trades open at once. But Gt3rs is right. Cheers

--- 帖子 #570 ---
My live broker is GMT, and my demo brokers are GMT+1 and GMT+2. Being a junior member, my posts need to be reviewed by de mods and there is a lot of lag.... Still i hope somebody will try to figure out a way to keep the lines for the previous days. Cheers!!

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Yes if EU and UJ are going up then EJ is going up stronger. I have a useful word document highlighting all these but haven't got a clue how to post it here.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
we watch the same 6 pairs heh. yah i find it's gd to have just 2/3 trades open. i used to open more but it's insane trying to keep track of what you're doing haha. moderation is key eh?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Yeah, but for me sometimes moderation becomes fear and that leads to immoderation. Ha Ha

--- 帖子 #574 ---
hi, i find that EU can fluctuate quite a bit and many times after i close half, if i move SL to BE, it will be hit before resuming its original move which can be heartbreaking so nowadays i usually reduce my SL but not so quickly, using other SR as basis. a gap of 30-40pip seems safer but this is just my limited experience. hope it helps

--- 帖子 #575 ---
boy, do i know what you mean...the path is fraught with difficulties !

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Anyone looking at EU and swissy?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
yes. just entered UChf at 0.9107. closed EJ at +34 pips closed EU at +35 pips

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Looking at EURUSD for sure. High of the day and gap to be filled.....

--- 帖子 #579 ---

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Day Open...for me midnight GMT.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
hello guys. Just enjoying the coversation. St3rs you talk a lot of trading sense my friend which i'll vouch for. Some nice easy trades so far today. always look for reason why to get into a trade.. i have been up early and entered a few already today (...got flu aaaaahhhh) UChf, bounced off open (always an important SR) EU the same bounced off 200 and broke through yesterday high. currently in AU (off open) and UChf (at ADR and through 9100) ***as i was chart skipping, reading and typing AU hit my TP of +20, Uchf still going SL to BE tp +20. going back to bed, good luck guys.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I haven't. Barely clever enough for this as it is. I just try to play what I see.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hello there, Missed the good'uns earlier. Oh well, always more. You've started something nice here. I didn't really like forum stuff till now. Too much bitchin'. Thanks again. (that's for the flu)

--- 帖子 #592 ---
What's D.O?!! Thanks for the sentiment, but best if we don't rely on luck! This deal met our requirements for entry. If it works it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't. The thing to remember is that we played our edge and that this trade is just the latest in what will be a LONG series of trades. And we know that in a long series of trades, we will come out ahead because we played our edge every time. So, in many ways, the outcome of this trade is irrelevant.........

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I'm not going long against the reversal candle, and more importantly against the gap......

hey kraven, do you have any system for trading news? or just trying your luck?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
from last week.. just took some more off EU for +130, move SL to under todays open so locked in 60pips regardless moved SL on UChf to .9124 to lock in +44

--- 帖子 #612 ---
it's all there buddy...seen a KRC and went for it. i made sure my SL was length of wick as the KRC was to big for SL...I didn't hang around as the 2 candles combined is over 100, so in and out as soon as it stalled. this may pullback and then continue up UChf just took BE out

--- 帖子 #613 ---
cool...i'm learning to be more flexible about my SL. saw the KRC but SL too big so didn't take. plus, it being news triggered, wasn't sure if it'll be a reliable signal. thanks, learning lots from you and others on this forum

--- 帖子 #614 ---
we have a daily GU short which broke earlier...i didn't get in (conflict of interest as i'm long EU) but i'll take it if it breaks 1.58280 again for a small bet

--- 帖子 #615 ---
anyone looking at the EJ H1 KRC forming now?

--- 帖子 #616 ---
well....i'd wait till it broke 105.500, however you have last weeks high, this weeks open and todays open all within 30pips of it. plus were in an up trend, plus the recent news pushed it higher and this is probably just a short pullback.....but who knows i'm more then happy with my takings today so i'm off to bed good luck

--- 帖子 #617 ---
yah i'm waiting for it to break that price too. we'll see gdnite!

--- 帖子 #618 ---
be careful buddy for the reasons i mentioned, i'd just go in small.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
yep they're going up, have cancelled my order... instead entered AU H1 long on dead stop @ 1.0726 SL - 1.0706 TP1 - 1.0744 (just below daily pivot)

--- 帖子 #620 ---
EJ coming up next? =)

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Looks promising

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi, Sure, here you go.....

--- 帖子 #623 ---
EJ order placed. Won't make the same error as yesterday and put stop lower than Day's High. Both my trades would have hit TP over night if I'd just played it straight.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Triggered SP 105.99 TP 105.39

--- 帖子 #625 ---
i've placed order for EJ too

--- 帖子 #626 ---
EJ H1 short triggered. SL - 106.02 TP1 - 105.18 (above today's open)

--- 帖子 #627 ---
GU next?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Yes, that´s a good possible short setup forming.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
looking unlikely now eh?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
We have to wait for the breakout, but untill now it´s still a good setup with that last red candle.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
i think for GU, the lower wicks for the last 2 bars are very long. cause for hesitation?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yeah, and a move to break would probably be a good confirmation

--- 帖子 #633 ---
GU high breached. short UChf (dead stop) entry 0.9096 my EJ SL about to be hit

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Yeah. I didn't allow for the spread sufficiently on EJ so perhaps was stopped too early. Looks like you're still in. I'm gonna a wait a bit to see how the day plays.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
What TF are you using, i don't see a trade setup there?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
H1. for GU, the reversal candle was at 0800h but it's no longer valid since the next bar had a higher peak.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
H1. But 08:00 GMT invalidated but might get one on 09:00

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Sorry, answered twice.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Sorry to be a pain, could you post a pic of this set-up from 08:00, i still dont see it, this is the GPP:USD ?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Sure

--- 帖子 #641 ---
GU looks on again

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Have attatched last candle trade for AUD:CAD, think it works?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
In Cable Trade, sell at 1.5838 with 27 stop

--- 帖子 #644 ---
GU and re-entry on EJ triggered. OMD you placed your stop perfectly.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
looks like a good setup mate, i usually only take trend direction candle trades but this one looks ok, move ur TP if trend line inches up

--- 帖子 #646 ---
EURUSD short from yesterday stopped me out. In again short from another failure candle. Sorry, couldn't post at the time. I've noticed an interesting pattern which sometimes plays out. Again, apologies but I can't post a chart at the moment. Look at EURUSD H1. We had a high, which we then pulled back from. Then we had another push up which also formed the reversal candle. This second push up and reversal candle indicates a false breakout/stop hunt for the big players to create a better price and increased liquidity for themselves before sending it off south.... Try to think about what these candles "mean" guys!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
First half off at +27 pips, second half to BE. Nice &amp; quick this one!

--- 帖子 #648 ---
happy to report that yes i'm still in EJ. greedy me couldn't resist and also entered short on GU (oredi closed half +9 and moved SL to BE) and EU. of course my UChf hit SL for -27 (i'm thinking i'd better reconsider dead stop for trend continuation, quite difficult) rock on.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Is Cable forming a double bottom at todays low and just above round number?

--- 帖子 #650 ---
I think foward direction could be south, as the daily chart has a good doji cross formed from yesterday, se will see how this 1H 100sma stands, was tested earlier, i wont enter unless we break.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Thanks-don't always remember to look at daily. I hope you are right about a move south. One thing I have noticed after an initial fairly positive response to news is that sentiment can change rapidly to the opposite!

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I am very sorry to admit that you are right and the big players are making the price not the market

--- 帖子 #653 ---
100sma and double bottom broken, see where she lands!

--- 帖子 #654 ---
I would feel more positive if 1.5800 broken though.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Fairly thick support there.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
closed half of EJ +20, half of GU +9, half of EU +14 now trailing the SL for all 3 as they move.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
hello all, looks like your having fun. Omd when was your UChf trade. i only see a possible entry at 9am which went up some 25pips and is still going..Good trades on EU and GU for upto 50pips...EJ a bit trickier, but if you stuck with the signal at the high of the day you'd be fine.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
i'm out of these but i can't complain, done well already this week.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
i just got triggered into this one now..... ....for a daily the SL is fairly low and i ain't put much on.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
it was the dead stop at 7-8am for short. don't think i will be using dead stop anymore haha, i'm obviously using them wrong ;p better stick to krc. hit SL for GU (total +18) and EJ (+26) still hanging in there for EU. missed a nice AU signal at 1100h. moving up now. anyone took it?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Still in this Cable trade with trailing stop of 27 pips (the original risk). Stop now moved to 15811 locking in 27 pips profit on my second half of trade.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
well the GU daily is going down nicely, already been 50pips up. will take some at +75 at 1.57520...my SL is now only 8pips

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Ric if you are in the short from the 1hr KRC then welldone. do you not have a target? as this move has went well over 60pips, that's like 2/3rds of the days ADR. personnal that would have done me for a 1hr trade.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Thanks for info and advice-I'm trying to cure myself of a bad trading fault (one of many!) of taking profits far too early. I thought I would set a trailing stop on my platform (IG Index) and see where it takes me on this occasion.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Wise words indeed! I'd vouch for you if I could!

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Yeah im in at 1.0676. SL - 1.0656 TP - 107.26 Entered 21:31

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Took 50+ pips after price neared my stop and then moved down again-

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Used a KRC on M15 off resistance TP at 200ma. Worked nicely.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
whats krc?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Kraven has got him (possibly her) self a reversal candle named in honour of the system. Kraven Reversal Candle.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Kravens Reverse Candle

--- 帖子 #672 ---
lol i see, dont want to spoil the fun but candle stick trading is nothing new, and about ever type of candlestick uve seen in this thread, including reversal/doji are widely used, for decades great way to trade options using them, on us equities!

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Yeah we all know that and Kraven says as much too. The thing here is not so much the type of stick, only one that turns the opposite colour to the trend and at the Top or Bottom (of course we don't know if it's a reversal yet). Entry is at the breakout of the signal candle, stop above/below. So this process is KRC. It can be used on pull backs and re-entries too. It's just another method. And as I said Kraven doesn't really lay claim to it as such. I don't think he even named it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Done for the day. EUR/USD H1: + 12 EUR/USD M15: + 85 Cheers

--- 帖子 #675 ---
just below the low at 105.66 or so ??

--- 帖子 #676 ---
in...half out for +11...sl to BE

--- 帖子 #677 ---
once again the last lot of signals all look like winners...i moved my stop early on EU and got stopped for BE after taking 11pips. i jumped into AU as well, but all entries on the pairs i watch have come good with varying success... ..i took profit of +25 after this pic ..wish i had jumped in on all 6 pair signals

--- 帖子 #678 ---
2 set-ups happening now..EJ and NU NU has 100mas, y low, 83500 resistance above it, the todays open..however it has just closed the weekend gap EJ has nothing really above and 105.500 support below, if it breaks i'm in with 17pip sl last for the day

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hi Kraven, this is my first ever post on FF I joined just to participate in your thread, thank you for starting this really simple trading system. By the way I am also in the UK London actually. I work full time so am really only looking at the daily charts.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Kraven - would you kindly tell me how to get that KRC on the chart. I understood it was an EA rather than an indi and I have absolutely no experience with EA's. Thx. Mike

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi WestAus, Where in WA are you ? I'm in Mandurah (just curious).

--- 帖子 #682 ---
I actually work and live in the pilbara but am in perth for a couple of weeks, just finished travelling europe/canada for 6 months Keen to trade with others actually!

--- 帖子 #683 ---
there are 2 indicators that a couple of guy's made. there on this thread. they will show you the candle but it's up to you to decide whether they are good enough to enter. my last AU trade i took for +25 went down over 70 ahhhh welll.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
hello Angie and welcome.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Still in GU daily. just place order on UChf and EU daily...there not great I'm also looking at EJ to see if it rejects the 200ma or continues past 106.00....just seen how early i bailed on my last EJ daily trade, i'd be 500pips up notice i missed a NU daily earlier, must have been the sunday gap that threw me....shame it's went 70

--- 帖子 #686 ---
do you always take your first profit (partial) at R1:1? how else do you do it? thanks...

--- 帖子 #687 ---
i don't see the daily signals you mentioned (UChf, EU, NU), do you mind posting the chart? thanks...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Possible H1 trades coming up on: EURUSD EURJPY SWISSY All from high or low of the day thus far.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I'm in EU, EJ. Less cavalier with my stops today.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
short on e/j?

--- 帖子 #691 ---
yes. Triggered and immediately gone a bit north. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
ok we wait, setup is not so good this time. e/j is on a uptrend on h4.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Yes, but I'm looking 1:1 and there have been H1 pull-backs throughout that H4 move.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Ignore "trends". This is a swing trading strategy. If it looks like an uptrend, every man and his dog wants to go long. That's a sure fire reason to to look for shorts..............................

--- 帖子 #695 ---
oh yes, i have forget this.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Seems to me that one very good addition would be for someone with the time and coding skills to make a dashboard of all the pairs showing when a KRC has been indicated. It's a lot easier than watching lots of pairs and in M15 and H1 timeframes.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Not at all necessary. Will just lead to confusion and over trading. Just monitor the majors on H1 timeframe. More than enough trades....... 2 or 3 trades a week is plenty. Someone said some wise words very early in this thread about new traders feeling they have to be in the market all the time, when actually, the exact opposite is true......

--- 帖子 #698 ---
This is a lesson I am learning.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
which signal did you trade on this chart ?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
KRC on EU

--- 帖子 #701 ---
timeframe would be useful

--- 帖子 #702 ---
anyone take the EUR:GBP 1hr trade a couple hours ago, was looking like a good short setup, i got in then got crushed as it surged north

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I know not everyone takes account of news when using this strat. but the Bank of England minutes released at 9:30 am had sharp effect on the pound I think.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
sorry H1

--- 帖子 #705 ---
i clicked for my trade to go in then a few seconds later i was $80 down, though i had stumbled on a terrible spread but it was just going up up up......

--- 帖子 #706 ---
think a few of us are already in a short position for EU from the previous H1 reversal candle which was also derived from the high of the day...

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Could you pic this, was it reverse candle or railroad?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Here you go.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Beware of support trendline. I feel if this breaks, we could finally make it back to the gap fill...

--- 帖子 #711 ---
True, but the 200ma is in the way.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
However, if it plugs the gap I can't see much holding it up as the momentum would be fairly strong.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
for fks sake ive been smashed in the last couple of days with every trade, lost a week work and more...ahahahrgajhahaha

--- 帖子 #714 ---
sorry about that

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi mate, maybe you could post up your charts with entries etc and we'll see if we can help?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Will try to put them up in next couple days. But i trade using rising star and falling star candles, other doji candles such as a large cross, usually at the top of a recent move up or down to signify change in direction. Also try to trade these only when above 100ema going long, and below going short. I use 1H charts on majors and usually only enter once the next candle has exceeded last candles low or high 'in profitable direction'. My risk reward ratio is 2.5:1 SL between 15-25, so some trades are not made due to large TP move required. Just been lots of good candles and then entered trades, only to be wipped out of them.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Ah! OK, so you're not trading the reversal candles as per this thread then. Maybe no point posting your charts for everyone to analyse.....

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hey Caillou, I see you are there. I reckon your M15 method is doing quite well today.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Yes I've been observing the M15 charts today and see what you mean.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Yeah, I've been following his tactic too. Marking out the trades I didn't take. I did score on one with the flow of the H1 trade: the break of the 10:30 candle. After the Brokers bit I got +10. Incidentally, just closed EU H1 at BE as I now want to see a break and test of the triangle (not thread rules I know), and I quit EJ earlier for -5 as I didn't like the fact that the Yen is clearly more of a pushover than the Dollar. Cheers. EDIT: Calliou method so far since 08:00 I reckon is +48. 5 trades which means my net would be something like +40 EDIT #2: Actually there might have been a dead stop long close of 10:15 candle which was voided by the 10:30 reversal so subtract 3 pips from that account.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
First of all thanks for nice thread and nice people around! I am following also 15m action, but there is some problem, and thats why i ask. How you are managing TP or taking your profits, are they fix amount of pip or depend on R:R, or counting candles. How can you know where to exit. I so also Calliou charts, nice, but in some there is like +20 then +10, sometime its looks like you know till which point it is going. Just be nice to hear some advice of tp or exiting position strategies. Tx in advance!

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Firstly I'm not sure if he is live trading, and he says he gets 0.5 spread, which is better than mine. That being said, he works on Stop at High/Low of reversal candle and an entry on break and a TP 1:1. Now, I used a order earlier and it worked out. The problem I have is: do I account for the spread in the order and maybe lose another pip and a half and allow for the spread on the TP losing another pip and a half. Or do I enter at exact price risking a tickle and away and use exact TP and have a hit on screen but not on trade. I know that this is a perennial problem but it means 10 pips becoming 7 and then the 1:1 does not work out. Any answers gratefully received.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I must add that the H1 method stacks up. I have made two dumb mistakes this week with regard to stop placing and turned winners into losers. It is a very good method, even if some days the H1 is a very slow burn. EDIT: It's real magic is it is probably the most back-testable method too

--- 帖子 #724 ---
This can be answer, may be, lets see if some on can confirm. If that is like that then account should grow quit nice, if there is time for set up right % on trading, for 1h it is enough time for 15 min can be less. Ok, than you for replay!

--- 帖子 #725 ---
quick notes today...be careful of EU and UChf, they've been rather flat. wegde like and could break either way. Omd y=the daily candles were...GU 20th (up over 170), NU 20th (now over 100), Nchf and EU yesterday - haven't triggered

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hi, Yes, for now today is really easy day, +58 pips for now...... And yes, R:R is 1:1, I don´t care about S/R, pivots, fibos, H/L, EMAs, TL......nothing, charts 100% naked. For now it works, till when? Nobody knows. Time will tell. Cheers

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Cool. I've added a template called Caillou. It has an eye calming colour scheme. I am going to investigate the Dailies now (which seem very accurate) as I can use super low stake on the slow burn and use M15 for my intra day. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
hi, for the NU (20th), that's a dead stop signal right? are you taking in consideration the close and open prices of the 2 bars rather than the wicks? coz their upper wicks are quite obviously apart (about 6pips difference). i had thought i was supposed to compare the high/low of 2 candles...pls correct me if i'm wrong... also, do you usually take your first profit (partial) at 1:1? and then let the rest run as you shift your SL? thanks...

--- 帖子 #730 ---
I think that on a daily level those pips are what might be called dead on.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
this is what i do. if it's a long position, KRC shows high of 1.3000 and low of 1.2980 and my spread is 2pip. i will queue to buy 1.3002 so on my chart i will enter at exact same peak point as KRC. meanwhile my SL will be bottom of KRC = 1.2980 which comes up to 22pip and that's what i set for my TP = 1.3024 short position, KRC high 1.3000, low 1.2980, spread 2. enter 1.2980 / SL 1.3002 (at least) / TP 1.2958 my 2-cents' worth

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Thanks.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
"dead on"? i dun understand

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Sorry, "Dead on" means "precise" or "spot on".

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Which pairs are people trading with the 1H method?

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hi Kraven or anyone who knows, When your trading from the daily candle what time do you put your trade on Thanks Angie

--- 帖子 #737 ---
ok! so you mean for daily bars, 6pip diff is close enough to be considered dead stop right? thanks!

--- 帖子 #738 ---
i think commonly traded pairs for H1 are EurUsd, GbpUsd, EurJpy, UsdChf, AudUsd, NzdUsd.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
No, I'm not saying that. I just suppose that that is the reasoning.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi Angie, Just place a stop order at the level noted. As you are here in the UK this either means looking at around midnight, or just first thing in the morning. Of course 00:00 is best as there might be a move in your direction over night, but in the morning you might notice that a High/Low has not yet broken or even that it has recently broken a little bit and you have your chance. Hope this is about right. I am most definitely not a master of the market.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Thanks Chulmleigh that's great

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I had a trade on the EU earlier on my 15mins charts around 2pm(Gmt+1), this actually went my way downwards for about 20pips but almost immediately my tp was hit, a reversal began. I really like the systems tactics but how do you guys take a trade, do you wait till the daily high or low is reached on adr before waiting for krc? Or is the signal taken on res/sup lines . and how do you follow a trend on the daily chart Kraven, i kinda only take a few pips and start s creaming when the trend continues.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Caillou my friend, thank you for idea M15, I am trade on 6 pairs these days and i can say I am very satisfied.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
6 pairs on 15m...wooohh way to many for me...i started off with this on the 15min with just 2pair.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Thank you. Yes, early days but really good for now......

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Omd this is were having different broker times is a pain...hence 15min can be good but choppy, 1hr is good....4hrs and daily can be effected by broker times (and this is why i post less about these...confusion would rayn) the pic below clearly show a KRC and so does the indicator, it was in a flat range but it's there. no dead stops or anything. i once chatted to a guy from malaysia, he was really into candle formations on 4hr and daily. he tried to explain some to me but it never made sense because our charts were 3hr out, so the paterns he seen were nothing like the chart i seen...think about it. be interesting to see what everyones broker time is... mine is +1...so new daily candle forms 11pm GMT

--- 帖子 #748 ---
wow Caillou - interesting stats today. M15 is king (for the moment anyway).

--- 帖子 #749 ---
well i haven't done much today...my Gu daily came good and i'm out now. very pleased as it hit my TP. UChf and EU didn't trigger EJ continued past 106.00 so i'm in there too. so nice day with little effort.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
i just had a pm asking if i'd taken any of the last 1hr trades and if i had which one's and why. the answer is i haven't..i wasn't around if i had the GU would be my choice (even if it works out or not). nice strong down trend, moved more then ADR and at low of today, found support at .56500 too. i would have avoided EU and UChf (i posted earlier why)..ranging, EU is in a wedge, nice if you get it right when it breaks, but choppy if you don't.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Sorry to ask a numpty question, but KRC? K.... Reversal Candle? Have gone back over old posts but can't see what the K stands for. Great thread, by the way. Up there with the handful that are actually useful!

Hi, which two? Maybe i will use one or two but for now i want to see different pairs how it works.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Entered on the break of the high of this blue bullish candle, with the SL 4 pips below the low of the same candle. **update: Up +20 currently with my SL set to breakeven. Free trade from here on out.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
you spent money on a TA course seriously though this has been covered a few times on the thread. the phrase was coined by someone at the beginning as the actual candle has few features (body size, wicks etc). me i'm just please to simply write 'KRC'.....take the title of the thread 'true trading tactics', what the hell does that mean? for me a simple 'TTT' if i'm abreviating. really call it what you like as long as we don't get confused my ego can take it. newnew the pair's i watched on 15min were EU and GU, sometimes EG (the lowest the spreads the better)

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Er... No, it was a joke!

--- 帖子 #759 ---
ah now that i see your chart it all makes sense i am generally quite clueless about time haha but my new daily candle started 1 1/2 hours ago

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Hi Holy Pips With the M15 method just take the 1:1 every time. Back test it for ages and you will see that it pays. Put the longer trend out of your head. You will see that this method sometimes allows for re-entry. Also, when following a longer move you have to suffer pull-backs, which can seriously eat into the equity - dealing with this has been a particular problem of mine. With this method there are times when you can profit on those pull-backs. I have a list to hand next to me so I can quickly determine lot size according to stop and % of pot. I Have also put 3 price labels on screen so I can quickly drag them into position and read as I fill out my order as you have to be quick. I have found (with, I must say, limited experience of actually trading this method) that an order works well as At Market has a delay which if the price moves quickly and adds the spread can easily see 5 pips removed from potential which matters. Also, with regard to Support and Resistance. Calliou does not bother at all. But I have always liked to know where the round numbers are. On M15 I set to 25 pips. If I see a rejection of a number like this and I see a Pin-bar that hasn't quite reversed colour then I will most probably take it. One more thing. If you get a competing KRC during the trade cut it dead. Perhaps even reverse it but do not let it run "just in case". Cheers. And remember...I am NOT the master of the markets. EDIT: I should also have said that according to Calliou's method the rule is every reversal and it does not matter where price is relation to any other mark on the chart.

Good morning, I have decided to look for M15 trades only, and since now I´ll be trading EUR/USD and GBP/USD, a calm morning for now, just +12 for GBP/USD. Cheers

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I'm still really just forward testing today. I did take a couple of M15 EU trades though and got out of the H1 at BE so I was up on the day and managed to get back to BE for the week after my previously mentioned F* ups. I will be using EU and AU as my broker gives me better spreads than GU. I suppose it's because it's an Aussie company. Cheers then.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Sure, if everything runs ok, I will be incorporating more pairs, AU, UC.......

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Would you limit how many trades you were in given multiple signals? It could get pretty sticky to manage.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Reversals or continuations or both?

--- 帖子 #768 ---
hey guys,can anyone advise me why my offline Range bar charts are not active when I open them? thanks

--- 帖子 #769 ---
He uses every reversal Trend and Counter Trend.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Once I´m in a trade, I set the TP and SL and I never modify that so once a trade is running, I forget it and look for a new possible trade in other pair. It´s not really difficult to follow 5-6 pairs......

--- 帖子 #771 ---
So I see none today so far but Calliou says he booked some pips on GU?

--- 帖子 #772 ---
It's the 8:45 candle. It's classed as a KRC as it just shades the previous one and makes a very tiny Swing Low.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Exactly

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Fair dooze. I'll cut my teeth first otherwise I will have silly thoughts of holidays in the West Indies and having a large country house. Ahhh...

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Anyway. Test update. EU 1 trade 30 pips. AU 2 trades 18 and 10 respectively. EDIT: in each case this is after the spread. I will be honest if I post more and figures will be NET not GROSS.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Hi Caillou; Now, you signal is in reverse trade GBPUSD (short, 11:00 CET) or reentry (long, 11:15). Thanks

--- 帖子 #777 ---
...that Kraven started this thread with H1 candles. So I suppose we shouldn't get too M15 heavy. Kraven. If you wish it to desist you will say, won't you? Vay 'umbly yours.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Hola amigo, No, 8h45 candle, long......

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Totally agreed, if Kraven is ok, I will stop posting M15 results, it´s his system, and his thread, I have only change the timeframe, rules are strictly Kraven´s rules.......

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I agree, 11.00 candle is a reversal candle?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Sorry Caillou but You do not enter the signal from 11:00 short reverse? Why? Gracias

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Hi. Not on my chart. Is fails by as much as the 8:45 (all times GMT so and hour out) succeeds. And the next candle is't a long as it isn't up coloured (green or whatever).

--- 帖子 #783 ---
In my chart I don´t have any reversal candle at that time.....

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I see a H1 Reversal Candle on GU. The Trigger has not fired yet.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
I see the chart having............ 10.30 candle and 10.45 candle as a deadstop, then the 11.00 candle prints 2 pips higher and closes RED (hense a reversal signal)? thanks

--- 帖子 #786 ---
hey pi,I agree the 1hr entry will below 1.5703,

--- 帖子 #787 ---
In my chart the 11h00 candle does not print 2 pips higher...... Cheers

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hey Caillou, would it not qualify as a dead stop on your chart?

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Sorry but who's 11:00 candle. Are we on GMT or CET?

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Sorry, I only trade Reversal Candle, anything else, no dead stop......

--- 帖子 #791 ---
FourX - re your problem with range bars - you do know they will only work if you set up offline charts? Best thing is to search here in Forex Factory - bound to be full instructions on how to do it.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
hey mate, yes I open them offline, but they are frozen from/at yesterday?

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Have you got an M1 chart constantly running ?

--- 帖子 #794 ---
I read almost all thread but still do not understand when take trade, after candle close or when it break line ?

--- 帖子 #795 ---
yes mate?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Very strange then.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
i can't beleive i missed all them trades at 1am (GMT). i was here and seen them but opted not to trade as i was doing other things plus they were all bouncing around the open line...

--- 帖子 #798 ---
On break. Otherwise you could miss a lot of the action.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Hello all, i have no problems at all with you guys trying it on the 15min. i've mentioned a few times that i started out trading this on the 15min chart. For the purpose of explaination on this thread i used 1hr and daily (sometimes). Reasons being are that i trade these a lot now, they are nice and slow with 1 or 2 trades per day (like the 1am trades i chose to ignore, any of them trades would have given me my pips for today, even for the week)...the idea is to get across that 3 good trades a week are enough. also so people wouldn't get confused (when people are posting multiple entries on multiple TF's on several pairs and then expect me to comment...noooo). also people often have a nasty habit of turning on the thread starter when things go wrong, causing the thread to die, even when they never introduced the TF's or indi's other have started using.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Lets stick to 1hr then,there would be less confusion,and plenty of time to alert others of a possible set up.I'm sure it would be better Skype room would be good?

--- 帖子 #802 ---
if people wish to trade 15mins why not do it the way i used too.. use your best spreads for two 15min charts (believe me this can be as important as your entry on lower TF's)...for me it's EU and GU. use 3 or 4 other pairs on the 1hr TF's. just a suggestion of how i used to play.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Caillou... If it's not to much trouble, could you please highlite your entries and exits on the 15m chart that was posted with your comment... I'm not sure I'm seeing it correctly... Like the idea of using the 15m TF but keep missing the proper entry/exit... Appreciate your input... Thanks much Cliff

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Understand completely. However if it works out for me I shall give thanks to those who have led me to it. Cheers all. Will watch with interest. James.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Thanks Kraven... I like that idea... my ADD just gets in the way of using the longer TF's Thanks much Cliff

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Pure price action. Doesn't get much better.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hey mate,keep posting your input is valuable

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hi Kraven, When you have multiple 1hr setups triggered on the majors, how do you select which trade to take? i.e., g/u, e/u, a/u, ... Do you look at which has been "swinging" the most or where it is in relation to its ADR at all? Thanks for posting the setups btw...too many times i have been on the other side of your trades it seems...all of those breakout fakeouts i used to take.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Ow, shucks Fourx. But seriously if you're looking at H1 then Kraven and Gt3rs are probably the boyz. Anyway, I'll probably find it hard to stay away. It's nice here.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Kraven Are you taking this setup?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Sorry brightside as with all trading there is no definitive answer. I do look at the swing and ADR, but also where the 100 annd 200mas are, the daily,weekly open etc...right now i'm in EJ and EU so got to cut this short

--- 帖子 #812 ---
ok i'm out of EJ for 1:1 (i was in both EJ and EU...i put GU by mistake on my last quick post). I got out because both kind of mirror each other, the pips i took on EJ will about cover any potential losses on EU. as i was trying to say in the last post all entries have to be looked at differently (it's also good practice to do so, something you'll probably not do on 15m TF) what did i see in these 2 entries? EJ a trade with the trend, support from y high and 106.500...EU support from previous weeks high, which had previously been resistance that kept it range bound for a few days

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Hey Kraven...are you long or short on them?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi there, Can i ask if some one can explane how you are managing tread in this situation, when after opening position next candle give opposite signal. This example is from yesterday EJ 1h chart. Thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #815 ---
ok you were long then on pullbacks?

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hey Kraven Why would you ignore that e/y reversal at the top?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Fourx, pi piper i am long fourX EY reversal? Dzero i'd probably exit and reassess the re-entry in the opersite direction

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Thank you for replay, i was thinking so. Now i got some confirmation.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
So I see a M15 setup on GU and if the H1 bar closes red then this is a H1 setup also - correct?

--- 帖子 #820 ---
hey Kraven the EJ pinbar 3 bars before your entry must have been a short signal, why did you not take it?

--- 帖子 #821 ---
no. why was that an entry? post a pic for me FourX

--- 帖子 #822 ---
It's not an entry, sorry K

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi Cliff, Just follow post 5. TP=SL, R:R=1:1. And yes, it´s better to focuse on H1 here, less confusion....... Thank you Kraven

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Entry criteria in the strong trend dan pullback (6 bars in the same colour). But after all is just about the trend. Post#258 Re-entry criteria in the strong trend dan pullback (3 bars in the same colour). But after all is just about the trend. Post #258 Sometime you got it reversed if the reverse candle exceed bars number of the strong trend . Post#259 Average Daily Range.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
just seen I got stopped out of GU.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
kraven, can I ask what your past results have been like? What's you average profit per week for example? Also how long have you been trading this method? Apologies if you have answered these already, I don't remember seeing them... Many thanks...

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Caillou why don't you post your EU 15min results at a given time? Say from london open to NY close each day. maybe you could post a pic including the TTT Signals indi at the bottom for ease of identification (by the way nice 15m trade on EU now)...someone else could do the same for the GU?

--- 帖子 #829 ---
I've been trding this way (consistantly) since Nov. first on the 15m and daily. but found the 15m was conflicting with something else i was trying, plus i had a few chopy moments so i moved to 1hr and Daily. i trade with 2 accounts. one is a spreadbetting account that i use for the 1hr tf (hence a lot of my 1hr charts are from a MT4 demo account...i watch the demo charts and enter on my spreadbetting account, MT4 charts are much better and easier to use). for daily trades i use a spreadbetting MT4 account (quite unique) this allows me max. flexibility because i can trade for as little as 10p. however i only enter using pending orders as the live execution is terrible...hence daily trades only. as for profits really hard to say. i am generaly up each week using this system (or i wouldn't be doing it) however some days i don't trade, some entries i miss, so it's hard to compare week to week or even day to day. today i have entered just twice, both kind of cancelling each other out. if i have a few good results on the 1hr TF and some bad on the daily I can still be ahead because of the bet sizes. yesterday my daily GU hit it's TP for 170pip and the EJ from yesterday is 80plus pips up, but i would have still prefered to have got in the the 1am 1hr trades this morning. but generaly both time frames workout.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
I had a setup on GBP CHF on M15 trigger so I am now long and looking for 9+ pips.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Thanks kraven, keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Thank you RoelsM, nice info got something for my self. Hope to get better results

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Good morning everyone..... I need some help here if someone coders here could add the % ADR TP target in pips on the ADR indie features setting ..... i found that TP target 33.3% ADR and 66.6% ADR in pips from ADR pips today is a good target to reach..... Also that i found the reversal bars that tend to be more successfull if they have lenght between 15-35 pips ..... Of course this simple research based on H1 TF only.....

--- 帖子 #834 ---
what do you mean by price labels? i find it rather stressful trading on the smaller time frames since it can take a while sorting out the order i want to place while the price maybe running away...

--- 帖子 #835 ---
what's a counter trend?

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Looking on GU and EU also AU. Which can be better look from your's side?

--- 帖子 #837 ---
GU stop me out, and looks like AU also will be SL hit. AU also stop out!

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi Guys, the system Kraven had shared looks good, and I had been subscribing and following, but those reversal candles doesnt occur as frequent as some had posted here in 15mins and H1 charts for my broker, Oanda . I posted a chart here, can someone point to me if this is valid? Thanks alot. EDIT: the reversal candle break down at 80.53, and according to this system, i suppose to sell. But i actually waited for the pull back and short it at 80.60 with tight SL at 80.67. I am not sure if this candle valid for shorting as basically it is counter trending. Hope someone can give me some guidance.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
H1 EU, EJ and UChf signals coming? just added adr indicator to my charts but not too sure how it works. for EJ H1, price is near adr high, does this mean a short signal now is more likely to be good trade? appreciate any replies...tks!

--- 帖子 #840 ---
EU and UChf peaks got taken out so not signals anymore. Placed order for EJ breaking downwards..we'll see... GU now has a potential KRC coming up.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Hi all, @kINSPK, Going by what Kraven explained on the first page of the thread,you are right.The spinning top make a new high when it was born but ended a bearish candle.It is valid.Kraven often place PO at the break of either the high or the low of the KR candle for his entry and prefer H1 chart.Maybe you should adopt this entry method.As concerned the trend,you are right too.It was up but do you know that can be the turning point and the beginning of something huge.All you have to do is to risk little for something huge.But do not forget setting your SL.Feb2865 said there is no trend on any a TF lower than Daily.Think about this.Just my 2cent. Sincerely, Adeshina.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Thanks Adeshina, your response is valuable to my learning phase. I realised that if i am to refer to this situation on the reversal candle(1st candle) and to enter at the next breakout candle(2nd candle), i would had been wipe out by the pull back(3rd candle), thus making a loss. I was pretty lucky to enter on 3rd candle(pullback) escaping the triggering of my SL. I had been following this thread for 2 weeks, and i find it simple and good. However, i hope i can fine tune it to my comfort zone in entry and exit, but whenever i see someone posted a chart with valid entries(reversal candles), my chart doesnt reflect the same. I missed opportunities. I wonder if anyone face similiar issue. I am using both Oanda MT4 and FXtrade.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
looks like very strong upward trend today huh...? quite a few signals that did not break out in right direction...

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Yes you´re right it´s a very strong up trend today. We have to be patience and wait for ALL the signals.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
just quickly popped on, my EJ daily hit +280pips, it's been running straight up for a while now so i've taken most of my purse off, left some on to run i took 1hr EU and GU earlier. GU just hit my TP of the previous weekly high. EU has just hit my modified sl of +30, i missed the actual reversal candle and used them as a trend continuation as the bars just shot up while i watched....

--- 帖子 #846 ---
just got into EJ...been running high and a KRC. * still in this with SL at 109.06

--- 帖子 #847 ---
No doubt about it. Very worthwhile and functional information circulates here.....

--- 帖子 #848 ---
got stop out of EJ as the euro keeps steaming up.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
kraven (or anyone else), can you take a look at this long signal i took on AU at 0700h on friday and tell me if it's a valid KRC? i just want to know if there's any reason i shouldn't have taken it as it turned false. thanks!

--- 帖子 #850 ---
It was a valid signal.....but the only reason you should not have taken it because it was too close to news release.....

--- 帖子 #851 ---
hi there omd, id be dubious taking a trade on that pin bar as you are buying into a weekly resistance area showing a strong resistance shooting star on the previous break out. pick and choose like a sniper have your criteria met. in any style there will be good signals that dont work out thats the beauty of screen time anyhow if entering after that pin you can see the bull candles are weak indecision candles or rising in agony. when in a position do not stick to a particular TP analyze each scenario as it unfolds. We do not know the future and no indicator can tell us better than what the Price action is narrating. Green pips to you brother. adz.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Chulmleigh thanks a lot for the reply was really helpful, and glad you let me know you use 1:1 R R.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
hello Kraven, good info.....just to share with u. if u want to know better the trend of movement look also the US dollar index ( daily). it will show to u the daily gap at US dollar index. From there u can know trade more confident...thank.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Omd hope this helps, it's my take on your chart. All in all i would have entered too. my main concern was that the price had failed several times to close above Y high line. and if RoelsM is right, then the news too.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Thank for Kraven method! I only trade in daily chart, so this is a price action method i'm looking for. I have applied this for trade from Fri-24/2 for EURAUD with entry in 1.2509, now it's more than 80pip profit After breakout from consolidation area with increase of volatility, my target for this trade at 261.8%. Anyone in this pair?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
thanks kraven, RM, adamegreen... re news release, the KRC started at 0700h at which time there was news and news again at 0900h. i entered during the 0800h bar, is that too close to the 0900h news release? how much time do you usu give to avoid being affected by news? thanks a lot guys, really helpful info. people in this thread are awesome! so much to learn...how long you guys been trading? are u full time traders?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
15min prior news is a good place to backtest on your charts ( attached is a news indi ) i have this set on my chart to show only news for that pair it is very handy if you don't have a second window showing news. check back from news history you can get a indi that will plot all news on chart to save time anyhow usually 15min prior is pretty safe. low and medium impact news are not big issues, high impact news unless you have a time strategy i.e 120sec hedge trade both ways with balls of steal..... don't bother. i dont want to take away from this thread in anyway as it is great to see a similar style to what i trade, there is a thread started by Niceguy who also showed a similar style with some great info on price action anyone who is interested can search for it on FF. wow look at this great H1 pin off Resistance, green pips to ALL!! Adz.

send you a pm nbelchior....didnt want to interfere with the thread

--- 帖子 #860 ---
OK i´m gonna look for the template/system ( darkonix )

--- 帖子 #861 ---
google is a wonderful tool - it finds most things.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Here is the system i use. It´s very usefull.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Dear Nbelchior, your signal for short is difference with Kraven's method, but this can be a good addition for this method in case we combine two candles (previous candle and your signal candle). Cause the first is a shooting star and the next is the confirm bar, so, blending of them can establish reversal bar. I have check an another example with UJ in pic, this combine can be good signal in support or resistance area.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
only 1hr signal i got today was this...went 100+pips so far..

--- 帖子 #865 ---
What pair was this on?

Looking at your chart it doesn't look like the EA part of darkonix is working.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Yes, it´s the news part that is not working, but anyway it´s not important because it´s only market information. The important thing about that system is that red/green line. The rest, is trash.

I've held off posting for a while to see what happens with this thread i started. And as with all basic threads the indicator craze starts to roll in. I honestly believe that's why there are so many bad traders around. The only ones i use are the big time MA's 100 and 200, as i've been told these are often 'observed' by big time dealing houses. if you read the thread in it's entirety you will get a good understand what i was trying to show. there are also 2 good 'tools' on here that will highlight the reversal candle...you have to use some trading sense on which to enter. two last bets...1hr EJ. not being able to trade the london open anymore i have to make do with US and early Asian markets, and when i see one like this i have to enter. we have a small uptrend, a KRC early at the start of the day which bounced off 200ma (around this time 100ma crosses 200ma). initialy i had a short SL at the top of this candles which in have moved with price. second pic is...daily AU we have a big KRC at a previous monthly high, it has now broke the last major low. my stops have been moved since this pic. my remaining tp possibley the 200ma...happy trading

Kraven, Thanks for a great thread here. The concept is spectacular and I have added some of my twists to it for my own use(no indicators though). I have manually tested this concept in some other faster moving instruments and it works quiet well there also. Thanks again, Wolf

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Kraven - The really great thing about this system is it made me look at price action without indicators and become more comfortable with it. I can now use this system by itself to make $$$ or I can use it in conjunction with other systems that I like to trade - either way - this system makes a difference. Thanks for your time and effort on everyones behalf.

Usdchf 1 hour forming the reversal bar but until closed

--- 帖子 #883 ---
just noticed the TT-signal bar indi repaints.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Yeah, if a lower/higher point occurs then naturally it can only log the true extent. Back tested it. Thing is you know what you're doing anyway without the TTT signals, using your nous and price position in relation to MAs etc. Still use KRCs but integrated into the whole now. As a hard back test shows that prevailing conditions count (you know that anyhoo) and just taking KRCs as they come can lead to a whipsawing. Better to use them as a clue. For me anyway. Cheers again and I may bother you again someday. James.

Thanks kraven... Then, how about the "TimeZoneOfData" ?

just leave it on 0. if you add anything here it moves the data. so if you have 'session' at 2 and 'data' at 1 the data colection starts at 3 (me thinks)

for 1hr trades today EU at 7am GMT, shallow but long uptrend. another signal at 16hr (as you'd expect UChf is the same but oppersite direction) NU 3 signals, 1st the candle is too big, the rest no real trend just ranging. AU similar.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Hello Kraven In addition to using your KRC's have you considered using engulfing candles? The rest of your criteria stays the same and engulfing candles can be as effective as your piercing candles. Will post some examples if anyone is interested.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Dea delite, kind of interest on your additional criteria toward kraven's method.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Hello all, there was a KRC on EU H1 a hour ago, but it is too big (40 pips) against 3 bar up (but the first bar is too small), will due to pullback soon? http://i600.photobucket.com/albums/t...Picture-65.jpg

--- 帖子 #917 ---
e/u i am short.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
with 40 pips you mean the long wicked? steve

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Short KRC but must consider a trend will continue due the 3 bars up.....

--- 帖子 #920 ---
on h1 , below the first red candle, i make my entry. steve

--- 帖子 #921 ---
I am not very confident about this trade.....will close soon...

--- 帖子 #922 ---
give this trade more time. Have you another pairs on outlook?

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Close with small lose....nope, will look for buy opportunity....

--- 帖子 #924 ---
i am short, and wait what the euro make!

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Try setting a SL and TP at the start of the trade and walk away. Let it breathe. It is much easier to say than to do, but it takes some of the madness out of the game. Will post some charts this afternoon with the engulfing candles.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Thank you. I googled it but couldn't find any information about KRC. Can you please explain to me what it is and how do I look it up on a chart? Thank you

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Hi all, dear MKK,you can refer to the first page of this thread for detailed explaination. Sincerely, Adeshina.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
MKK are you serious, what do you think people have been posting about in the last 63 pages lol. Try reading Kraven's excellent posts from page one, he clearly describes what kind of candle he looks for, which has later been named after him the Kraven Reversal Candle

--- 帖子 #942 ---
LOL, sorry I didn't understand that this was named after him and that's why I asked. Now I know.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
hello all, quiet day. my daily CU got stopped at +30 from yesterday. I only entered the GU today for reasons on the chart. doesn't matter what system you use you have to see the bigger picture.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
We have action on the dailys. EU and GU (as i'm already selling GU i'll just stick with that. I've moved my TP and used it as a daily entry though). N/U and A/U (not much overnight news so i've opted for N/U, got a pending order on N/U). I'm in on U/C too (although for some reason i'm apprehensive so only 40pip SL).

--- 帖子 #945 ---
hi guy is the formation going on the uschf and eusd krc (1hour)

--- 帖子 #946 ---
on e/u i wait, the 1 h candle is not good.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
entered the EU short 1hr (waiting for news now) GU, NU (should have took AU ) and UC all positive, have quickly shortened SL

--- 帖子 #948 ---
The progress of usdchf of setup i notice all earlier Attached Image (click to enlarge) AND THE GU ON DAILY Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #949 ---
i am too late on e/u , wait on the next 1 h candle.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
the decision to get in on EU was before US data was good. GU, UC, and NU all in profit. I've locked in some pips on EU and GU..fancy EU to bounce around .32500 (if it gets there) so my TP is before this. ** I bailed earlier on the UC for 30pips.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
dead end on audusd 1 hour

Any ones look at these pairs now? KRC formation. Maybe we should wait for the red news.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Vnfx never seen your post. yes I spotted GU (hope you did too) closing in on my TP. also entered UC on the candle circled kind of a KRC, ignore the Stocastics i was playing about.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Hi Kravel, thanks very much for your thread. I took GU as KRC yesterday and now waiting to see if Price can break out the resistance or not. I did not take UC yesterday but today based on the daily candle reversal, although not a KRC but I think the price just rejected from the resistance zone. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...7&amp;d=1333077214 http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1333078593

hi kraven, i've been trading on the daily charts and was wondering about something. usually before mondays, i have a daily candle that begins on sun and lasts only 3 hrs. not sure why. do you treat it as a regular candle, ignore it or what? anyone else care to advise? thanks guys...

--- 帖子 #956 ---
It's all too easy to get lost in a myriad of TIs, when trading spot forex. There are many systems out there, including some on FF, that are very indie intensive. Most of these indies are lagging and serve no useful purpose whatsoever, except to decorate the chart, often like a Xmas tree. Thanks to Kraven, who has devised a simple, but effective system. I feel that it could be enhanced by combining some other c/stick patterns. However, that is only my opinion and in no way detracts from his excellent, simple system.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Hi Kraven, I've just finished reading all this thread!!! You have a nice system Good pips for all!!! Greg.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
hello all, thanks for the comments Alan i'm sure your right but i tend to just use this and sometimes pins (if there tight) i got into the EU 1hr today at 2pm gmt, had the same signal on GU. just bailed for BE, GU would have been better option. on dailies my UCad got triggered, about 30pips up

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Hi Omd, your chart is same with me. Cause of the time zone of broker (server time zone can be GMT+0). I think you should use other broker's platform for analyse (ex: GTM+2, GTM+3).

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Hi, this is my firs post here. I would like to say to kraven that his method of trading and this thread are great. I was trading similar to KRC system for a year, but now I modified it a little thanks to this thread and my profit is even better keep the good work

Using these reversal candles has been a key component to my trading for quite a while, though I trade them a bit differently. 1. I look for these reversal candles to be out of the way of previous price, I won't take a signal that is in the middle of consolidation or in the middle of any recent price. I will take signals at the tops or bottoms of these areas but not in the middle. This limits your trading opportunities but also significantly increases your win %. 2. My entries are 1 pip above below the signal candle high/low depending on direction 3. my stops are 2 + spread pips beyond the wick for a stop. 4. Fixed TP of 20 pips per trade on the 15 min changes 5. BE after 10 pips. 6. The trade either hits my tp, ends at be or hits my sl. I do not mess with a trade once I have taken it. 7. I don't use the reentry methods outlined in this thread, there is nothing wrong with them, its just not part of my trading method.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
I agree with you about using set targets and allowing the trade to fail or succeed with no interference. When you say about trading reversal candles which are out of the way of previous price - is it sufficient to look at candles which form at the current day's high/low or do you have further criteria?

--- 帖子 #975 ---
daily highs and lows are good places. I added a chart marked up with entries from the past couple of days that should illustrate A couple of other rules I have that I forgot to add, its hard to pay attention to charts and maintain a train of thought: 1. ignore entries where the preceding candle was very large in relation to the rest of the candles. 2. goal of 40 pips per day 3. stop trading @ -40 pips 4. trade from 6am - noon eastern standard time (you could trade from london open / NY London overlap) the idea is to trade when there is the most volatility. 5. if price begins to bunch up get out and look for a new entry, this is my only exception to the leave the trade alone idea.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Hi all,and Thank you Kraven! Now I just tell u only this word! Last night(21:00-1:00GMT+9hours),I can get about 270pips in 4hours.I'm happy now^^ EURUSD,AUDUSD,AUDJPY,NZDUSD,USDCHF and USDCAD chart,I could find the entry sign.Then I got many pips(for me). p.s I'm sorry,if my english is bad.please don't angry.my 1st language is Japanese.In my daily life,I don't speak and write English...

I got 80pips.thank u Kraven!

If you follow the above advice (and examples) you will stand a chance of making a profit. The first three pages, or so, of this thread describe a strategy which will destroy your account unless you already know how to trade off support and resistance areas. Another point to make is chase a good reward:risk ratio.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Here is an example of using divergence to give a better entry. Note, if you use the candle for your SL and TP size, the first example would give 1 : 1, the second goes to 6 : 1. Obviously we should move to break even as soon as possible (1 : 1) and hold as long as possible... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Unfortunately, the second example would not make 6 : 1 if you moved your stop to break even at 1 : 1.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Here's what to look for if you want the best entries. It's worth waiting if you can. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice how long it took to make 1 : 1 if you used the candle length as your guide. Lots of patience needed, to wait for the set up and to wait for the profit. Rookies would lose money on this.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
The above example, taken from July 2011, would have taken 1 : 1 and if you had split the trade into two, moving the second half to break even after 1 : 1, the second half would have easily made 6:1 or even 10:1.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Here's an example of a divergent candle which looks good, but that's all. You must have another reason to take it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The second candle has lots going for it. It still might fail, so use 1 - 2% risk. Let it run if you possibly can. 2 trades is a good idea, 1 : 1 and at least 3 : 1 for the second. This means if you only get 50% right, you will not lose money.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Here is a perfect example. if you can wait for these then you will make a lot of money: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I didn't bother to put an arrow here. Anyone can identify the lonely little candle.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
That's it really. Sorry for hogging the thread. If you are like me, you will take a lot of dodgy trades and miss lots of good trades. That's why I'm typing this instead of sitting on some sun kissed beach somewhere. Bye for now...

......nice......

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Nice to hear your comments. When I started this thread i just wanted to give people an idea of simple trading. I really didn't go into to much detail as I believe people should adapt these strategies to suit themselves. I showed the entry candle, how i use SL's etc using candle size, and where to look for candle (at highs/lows of days/week, not in the middle of a range..as you just said). I've always stipulate the importance of RN's and S/R. I try to steer away from to many indicators, although i sometimes use 1 or 2, simply because we all use different one's at different settings..eg. you use MACD i tend to use Stoc's. if looking for divergence. I find people posting charts on different TF's with different indi's confuses a thread, hence i post 1hr and dailies only, but maybe I should go a tad further. I mentioned earlier in the thread that I used to do a lot of 15min TF trading (and i still do when needed), here's how: This is a pic of the CU weekly. I draw a thick black line on weekly SR area's (pink lines are daily). you can see how it has been respected several times, you'll also find these often happen at RN's.

--- 帖子 #987 ---
When price is approaching these higher TF S/R area's go down to the 15min TF and wait for an entry candle. We don't alway get one but a lot of the times we do. the Stoc's show some divergence. So we have a small entry SL of about 10pips, hitting a Weekly SR, hitting a RN, with divergence..note the divergence part is the least important to me

--- 帖子 #988 ---
One more...GU, these are daily SR. the black circles indicate where the price has paid past respect to SR (always use the most recent, the rest are just re-enforcement)..the arrow is were i was waiting on 15m TF.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
jump to 15min TF.....as you can see i got in on this (still have a small bet on). these are hard to catch as they can happen anytime but the R:R can be huge, entering on 15m and using daily/weekly for TP area's......just another strategy to add to your trading tactics.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Thanks for the thread, kraven, I've enjoyed reading.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Kraven, I'm not deliberately targetting you but divergent candles are a pet subject of mine. I draw your attention to the chart posted on page 1 of your thread - the Gbp/Usd chart, daily, 2011. In your example you cite approximately 12 trades, 9 of which are winners. In fact there were more than 14 in the time period you used. Of the first 14, 8 failed and 6 succeeded. Not a good ratio. Here's my chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm prepared to discuss each candle individually if you disagree. I don't think you did it deliberately but I don't think it's fair to leave that post without some sort of comment, do you?

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Can you post my pic that you are referring too? you say page 1, I believe all those were 1hr charts done from my demo account. Yet you show a daily chart? the 1st page was full of idea's of how to trade 1hr TF. On the dailies i tend to be strict with my SL, quick to BE and conservative with TP. SL is often put above the breakout candle like in post 12 to limit loss, or even at the open or close of the candle. I look for steep rises and drops, RN's, SR and major MA's etc.. to judge my trades. But i've explained that already. recently I had a signal on EU daily but never entered because the prior candles looked 'flat and ranging', it ended up an excellent trade ...but i get quite a few of these, the market settling/running out of steam before a turnaround. I mentioned it before, but i'll say it again, every trade should be looked at differently. like buying a second hand car, look for the pro's, the cons and the price.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
It's post No. 6

--- 帖子 #994 ---
To ask me that is a bit disingenuous, don't you think?

--- 帖子 #995 ---
why disingenuous? was it so hard to tell me where the pic was? after all you didn't show it you showed your own and I posted all that months ago. This isn't a strategy, it's just something to look out for..a tactic as such. you use it with divergence which is good. You will notice on the pic I merely indicated the candles. I wrote down how I seen it, quickly rounded up numbers where i'd take profit or BE and jotted it down, plus it was done all in hindsight. there was nothing scientific or even mechanical about it. I looked for around 1:1. however throughout this thread I have tried to stay away from strict R:R. treating each trade individualy. This said, on the first entry if you entered and used the signal candle as your SL and let it run you could have got close to 1:3, but I know i wouldn't have. Around july 12 we have a pinbar type entry that if you entered it went past the previous high over 600pips. did I include all of them, no, as i know I wouldn't have got them all. But someone more patient and calmer then me might have. if you read my last post you see I approach dailies different, all trades individualy. In live trading sometimes my SL is at the bottom of the signal candle, sometimes at the bottom of the breakout, sometimes at a RN or previous low. The pic you refer to was done as a quick opener as to what to look for and nothing more. Where individuals when we trade. On this thread I've posted in hindsight and live trades. some win, some loose.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Smikester, I can see your point. To me it seems that Kraven sort of cherry picked the trades. Though visually backtesting can sometime fool your own brain as you are baised for your method to work. So I'll give Kraven benefit of the doubt. However Smikester is ready to discuss each candle in detail and I suggest we should do that to verify if we truely have an edge here. I do like the idea of using Trendline, R&amp;S and divergence to select trades. Otherwise choppy market will take you for a ride one of these days. Plus you can't just for any candle that failed to make a new high or low, that candle needs to show change in sentiment. That's where candle reversal patterns will come into play. and then this strategy is nothing new.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Kraven, has provided several ways to look at PA when it nears potential reversal... Nothings set in stone on any setup... If it follows thru, you make profit... If it fails, you lose... It's not called a bet for nothing... To demand a debate over what each setup ended up doing or not doing is a fruitless waste of time and energy... Better to spend a bit of time trading and make a few bucks... Then enjoy the extra time you'll have with your family, friends... Kraven, Thanks for sharing your thoughts on using this setup on different TF's... It has improved my trading profitability greatly... Thanks much... Cliff

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hi K, In the attached chart, breakout candle circled in blue is also a reverse candle in the opposite direction. How do you deal with this? Do you close short position and open long?

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Please upload ur RSI MA indicator....

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Hey xlitang... Check out the chart provided by Kraven on post #4... Look at the PA on 9th of Jan. Very similar to your example... He demonstrated that based on his criteria it ended as a 25 pip loss... I'm a bit more aggressive... My SL would have been above high of KRC in that example... So would have been profitable trade... It all depends on your taste for risk and how much your willing to risk... Another thought... The way your looking at what your calling a reversal candle circled in blue doesn't pan out. It does qualify as a breakout candle that finishes positive. It does not come any where near your SL suggested by Kraven in post #5 so you would stay with the trade which does end up in your favor. If it had nailed your SL then it's a loss and you look for the next setup. This exact scenario is also highlighted by Kraven in the example trade on the chart in post #4... Jan. 9th... which ends up as a 30 pip win... Once again, it should be stated that we, as traders, are not going to out think the market. Play the setup that's presented... Your wins will out perform your losses... Don't over think it... don't get juked... follow the body, not the legs... Hope this helps... Cliff

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
Silly me...I put smikester on ignore Kraven work your magic You have way more supporters... than detractors.

Redbox, I backtested your EA and looks like it missed a lot good setup. Can you share your source code so that I can look the logic behind?

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Well said, that man

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Thanks for the reply. Appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
an idea would be to look at which reverse candle is the stronger. in the chart you highlighted, it is clear the red reverse candle is the stronger. so you stay with the short.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
hello all. thanks for the replies. I've said it quite a few times that the candle is just something to look for in conjuction with other things. This is not a strategy on it's own. in the pic and in an ideal world, i would not have took the 'yellow circled candle'. the up trend has went flat/ranging over the 5 days prior. If anything I would have took the 'blue circled' candle as the market pulls back and trend continues. however this candle wasn't triggered. now if you decided for what ever reason to take the first candle (sell) then you would have had a successful trade because what you should do when the next candle is complete, seeing it is another reversal candle, is put your SL above it plus a buy entry. As the second candle wasn't triggered the first entry was still good. Now the candle that interests me is the 5th candle from the yellow circle. Nice downtrend, higher low. would have had to wait a few days to move SL but after that a nice move up with a few re-entries too.

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Do you know what is sad about this post? It epitomises the attitude of the majority of gamblers on this site. Kraven. I am not a detractor. I merely pointed out some discrepancies and some improvements. Here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=198118 sinner- Now retired, made loads of money from trading. A mate of mine on these threads. And so I made a study of divergent candles. I've seen them described in this thread as "Kraven candles". What am I supposed to think about that? There's nothing new about them except to rookie traders who have never heard of them. So please? Let's not shoot the messenger? lore? So keep the thread going. Kraven, keep up the good work, work hard. Good trading to you all.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
This is not directed directly to smikester, but to anyone who mentions this again. Please read ALL the thread, you will see I have never claimed to have invented something new, this is merely something I look for and have 'personaly' not see it in any candle recognition thread. I didn't even name it 'Kravens Reversal Candle', I purely called it a reversal candle, someone else on the thread kept calling it that, so I called it the same (KRC) to save confusion. All will also note that I don't post a lot of charts on here now as I feel I have basicaly accomplished what I wanted, that was to show a simple candle set up that 'might' help others with their trading.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
If you know better way of trading, why don't you share your knowledge and skills with rookies. They'll certainly be grateful to you...

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
In Kraven's defense, if you read the first page you will see that he never tried to take credit for anything. He's also stated throughout the thread that the reversed candle shouldn't be relied upon alone. In other words use it in conjuction with other things. Seems to me like something that will work long term if done properly. Lastly, candlesticks and divergences go way back well before all of our lifetimes.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
.. I suppose?? You’re not wanting to be critical with this statement”What am I supposed to think about that? “Who cares what you call it... Does it work? For some maybe yes... for some maybe no? The point, the “rookies” will eventually realize that there are many names given to all manner of trading concepts/ideas. As you previously stated “made loads of money from trading “. Please impart your vast wisdom upon us ... I would argue that this would be the most constructive way to get you point across. Just one traders point of view TSD

Hello TY for this thread. Im a rookie and still learning alot. I still dont trade live as i am not yet good enough, but this method is helping me raise my confidence. I have a question, i hope you can help me. Today on the Eu$ (may 28th) there was a reversal candle on the 4 hr chart to go short. At the same time there is a near-dead stop (10 am) on the hourly chart to go long. (im on GMT+1) This kind of cunfuses me. Would you go with the higher frame (more dominant) move or does this signal "Do Nothing"?? I have enclosed two screen shots. I hope i was clear enough in the question... TY !!!

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
can we used market open to determine trend flow, and use this tactic?

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
The best tactics is not to brake the money management rule and to disobey all other rules you have read in the theories of how to trade. You will conveniently be profitable.

Hello everyone, I have been testing this system for 2 days and the results are good, just following the reversal candle, if it goes to the other side just hedge position, then add to the original buy/sell order and close the trade when breakeven... Kind regards!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
which system?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Post #4 system. However, I forgot to mention that I don't wait for the candle to breakout, I just enter when the signal candle closes. Regards.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
you trade this system with stop loss ?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Instead of stoploss I hedge my "losing" positions.
