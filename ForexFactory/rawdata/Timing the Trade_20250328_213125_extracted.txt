Timing is everything when it comes to trading! How many times have you entered a trade only to have your stop loss hit....and then the trade takes off in the expected direction?? Happens all the time to traders of all skill levels....but mostly to newer, less skilled traders. Finding high probability trade setups is only half the battle. Timing the entry is critical to managing risk and preserving capital....which is really the only thing the retail trader has any control over (especially when trying to get started trading with less than a well funded account)! As I have time to post, what I'm hoping to accomplish in this thread is three things: 1. Show how I identify HPT's (high-probability trades). 2. Enter these trades putting time on my side. 3. Trade using less risk and lower margins. Disclaimer: The information and charts that I post in this thread are strictly for educational purposes only. Absolutely no trade recommendations are being suggested or recommended! Thanks in advance for stopping by... hopefully my efforts will be worth your time! More to follow.....

Here is a chart and my analysis of the US Dollar Index on the futures market: Price action has broken a down trend line and has moved into a supply zone. As the US market reopens off the Labor Day holiday, I am looking for price action to move down off this level into the fib retrace levels over the next couple of days. If and when this happens...I will be an interested buyer between 81.58 and 81.41

Gold Futures update: Closed the earlier scalp trade for a profit. Price action has reached an 'area of interest' for me. I will be looking for a short entry. I plan to use a binary option for the short trade. I will chose an expiration a few days out. This way I will put time on my side. Even if the trade moves against me, I have until the option expires for the trade to move in my favor. I will go into more detail on the next post.

Unfortunately for me, I was away from the computer last night and had no time this morning to look for setups. his resulted in a couple missed opportunities. The beautiful thing about trading is that there is always another trade around the corner if one has patience. GC: Gold Futures moved up into and then out of the area of interest I had identified on post #3. I was hoping to get an entry higher up on the supply curve at the 76.4% fib retrace.

Usdjpy: Assuming price action moves down into the 98.11 area, I will be an interested buyer in that range. If this setup occurs within the next couple of days, I will take this trade with a Binary Option. I will select a weekly expiration to show how these can be used to put time on my side. The next screen shot are the current weekly Binary Options available for the Usdjpy pair. Ideally I would be looking for an entry around the 98.00 level. If you look down towards the bottom of the next screenshot, there is a Binary contract available at 98.25. If you look to the right, the expiration is Sept. 13th (Friday the 13th!). This means that if price action comes down into my area of interest...and I purchase this particular Binary Option...then I have until Sept. 13th for price to move up and out of this area. The strike price on this option is 98.25....This means that if I hold the option until expiration (Sept.13th), and the Usdjpy closes above 98.25 at 3 pm on Friday, then I win the trade.

Einswaltz, I don't use any indicators anymore. I used to though! I was very determined to make indicators my Holy Grail for many years.....but unfortunately for me it was an expensive tuition. After much searching I came across two resources that have made a big impact and improvement in my trading. 1. Sam Seiden. Google: 'Sam Seiden supply and demand'. He has a bunch of videos that will help you understand. 2. On Forex Factory....under Trading Systems....search for the number '309766'. It will say 'no results found' but you will see a link for a thread that says: 'Extracted Thread (per thread starter's request)'. This was started by a trader named Rocky. You will quickly see that he is the real deal and has posted literally hundreds of charts. Start at the beginning and work your way through it! It will take a while...but the time will be very well spent. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
thankyou very much for the reply.. what currency do you trade? are you a intraday trader?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
EinsWaltz, I focus on intraday trading. As far as currencies...I usually stick to the majors (Eurusd, Gbpusd, Audusd, Usdcad, Usdchf, Uadjpy). I will take trades in the Spot Forex market, Nadax market (binary options) and Futures.

Hey bantro, What say about Gold? Lingering around 'not so fresh' demand zone, with higher volumes on down candles and low volumes on demand candles. Overall volumes are still low. It also declined from previous supply zone of 1394 - 1399 and then again from 1394 (low depth touch). Seems like bearish to me.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Tilf, In my opinion...if you step back and look at GC on a longer timeframe, it's currently in the downward leg of the longer uptrend. The area coming up that needs to be watched is the bottom uptrend channel line. This level also corresponds to the intermediate 50% fib retrace. If it breaks the channel line....I will expect a further price action to eventually target the longer term fib retrace levels (drawn from the A-B swing).

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Agreed with the longer time frame downward leg. Just a bit curious on how to read volumes. The price decline prior or NFP (From 1400 to 1358) had higher volumes than the rally after NFP and the subsequent decline from there. This would indicate selling pressure at around 1400? Further, there are no solid volumes on follow through candles as well (follow through being candle after a reversal candle). Your views with volume analysis would be of great help and much appreciated. Thanks in advance

Tilf, I really only pay close attention to volume when it's doing something unusual...like big spikes or volume falling off as price extends upward or downward. Or as it's approaching an 'area of interest' (major fib levels, supply/demand zones, trendlines/channels ...etc). What I currently see on this 60 min chart, is price moving down on lower volume as it's approaching a level I'm interested in. That makes me sit up and take notice. Big spikes get my attention as well. I mentioned an 'Extracted Thread" yesterday that might be helpful to you. If you make your way into about the middle of the thread, the author goes into lots of detail about volume. Hope this helps...

Hi bantro1...how can we know the difference between institutional S/D and non-institutional S/D?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Usdjpy Update:

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Einswaltz: These zones are only created by the Institutions (the 'big boys'). These professional traders know days...even weeks ahead where they intend to enter the market and where they will start accumulating or distributing their holdings. And as a retail trader (or 'weak holder'), the best odds of having trading success lies in shadowing their moves. And in my opinion, the best way to do that is by learning to trade the way they do and also learning how to use volume to your advantage (volume spread analysis).

Thankyou for your quick reply and good answer,really appreciate it.. i have some questions at the moment hope u can reply it - How can the news (daily news, rumor, war, etc) affect this trading system? - For intraday setting does the high low or pivot of the previous day/week/month has a relation with supply demand? - For intraday setting does the sessions (asia,europe,US session) should be watch too in the supply demand system? Thankyou

--- 帖子 #67 ---
you could just attach the indicator Volume UpDown ?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Finist, Yes, the 'volumeupdown' is the one I use. Even though it's listed as an indicator...volume is in a completely different league than most other indicators such as mac'd, ma's, stoch etc..

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Einswaltz, Those are good questions. I personally don't pay too much attention to news events with the exception of the biggies like...Nonfarm payroll. Deviations from analyst's expectations on economic data can certainly create volatility and temporarily affect price action. For the intraday trader, that can create opportunity! When forecast are missed or exceeded, the big players step in and move price. The net effect of this for the intraday trader can be new supply/demand zones that are formed or possibly price action being driven into extreme fib retrace levels. The best times to trade intraday are when the major markets are open. Late afternoon and early evening can be iffy.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
....as a follow up to that last post: I'm sure most traders who look at the economic data has been surprised to see a miss on a forecast only to see price do just the opposite of what should be the reaction to the event!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yes, this happen sometimes.. and what about the other high impact news? i mean when the trade come to the supply or demand zone and high impact news is also coming...what will u do? thankyou

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Einswaltz, What I try and do is look at price action and volume. If price action is sitting at a significant level before a high-impact economic data release and not doing anything.....then it's not a significant level! Significant economic data that is missed or exceeded tends to create significant levels that we can...first Identify and then possibly use as opportunities.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
for example: post #19 was a short-term demand level created by a miss on non-farm payroll.

Scalp trade from post # 75 stopped out for -11 pips Here is a scalp I took earlier this morning. Closed for +22 pips

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Bodine, I look at Binary Options as another tool in the trader's toolbox. There are a couple of good things that I like about Binaries: 1. They put time on your side. When you're able to do that....entries don't have to be perfect because (depending upon the expiration chosen) you may have several hours to a week to be right with the trade and as long as price closes above the strike chosen...you win. 2. Can't get stopped out.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Scalp trade this morning: Gpbjpy

--- 帖子 #82 ---
EinsWaltz: My charting platform is NinjaTrader and the volume indicator is 'Volumeupdown'. Green volume is simply showing the volume on an up candle and red is just the opposite. Volume is showing trading activity so it is most relevant when the various markets around the world overlap.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
ok..so its only a normal indie... another questions - what if the candle is red/down but the volume is spiking green? and vice versa...what does it tells us? and i find that sometimes the red candle can turn to green candle..this is quite deceiving sometimes - what if the volume spike but the candle is small? - what is your signal for scalping? i mean u enter after then second candle? or do you get in once the price get to supply.demand area? - furthermore about institution orders...i read some website that gives info about institutional orders...where they put orders... does it works? thankyou for your answers.. really appreciate it..if u have and good source for the volume analysis you can share with me...

About post #84 u scalp the USDJPY...is that a short scalping? what was your entry? can u explain the factors that made u enter the trade? i really wanna learn.. post #88 is a great trade btw !

--- 帖子 #93 ---
EinsWaltz: Yes, post # 84 was a short scalp trade. My entry was 99.16. I took that particular trade because I was confident the pair was heading lower into my target zone on post # 88. I took the trade because it was low-risk with a tight stop. Price had been moving sideways for a while and if you look at the peaks around 99.30, volume was falling off on each retest of that area.

Bantro1...how many years have u been trading forex? do you work in an institutional also? - Post #96 its a level above level...where do you think the good entry price to long? and 1 want to ask why does the price around 0.9341(fib 76.4)doesnt act as a demand zone？（in 60minute chart looks like a zone, i am still a newbie) - about the supply and demand...why do the institutionals put the order at the same level again? i cant find the good answer anywhere for this question..really want to know what their thinking thanks again

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hello Bantro1, The Demand &amp; supply zones are very interesting! THanks for sharing your thoughts. Do you trade that way? 1) Demand/Supply Zone starts with a "institutional Volume Spike"?, when there was lower volume before? 2) You Sell at Supply and buy at Demand zones? Back to Post #86: I would have gone long when price moved to the top little green zone above. It would have turned out as a loose trade. But I had little risk and would have re entered short with take profit at second demand zone. Do you agree?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
EinsWaltz: I have been trading Forex for about 15 years...just about when it became legal in the US. As far as post # 96 goes...fibs are not supply/demand zones. They are important in and of themselves (the deeper levels if mapped out on a chart correctly) but the fibs really catch my eye when they align with other factors. Like trend channel extremes, trendlines and supply/demand zones....confluence! I was not in front of the computer when the Audusd touched this level so I didn't show this trade. I did however take the trade as a scalp on my phone and closed with + 35 pips. Whenever you see price move rapidly up and out of an area, as it did in this case, it shows an imbalance in order flow. Demand overcame supply. Price moved away so quickly that all the buy orders didn't get filled. So the big players bring price back down to where there are significant unfilled orders so they can be filled. And as long as those unfilled orders are still sitting at that level, price will usually move away again. The way I handled that setup was a entry a few ticks above the fresh demand zone with a stop loss a few ticks below the zone.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Apfelsaft, Like I mentioned in the last post...supply/demand zones are created when there is an imbalance in order flow and as a result, price is quickly driven out of an area usually on higher relative volume. I don't try and anticipate where the next level will be formed. I simply wait until they are formed and then wait for price to revisit them. And they happen in all timeframes if you know what to look for. Your second question is partially correct. I look for zones but only if they meet my other criteria and align with confluence. This lowers risk. On post # 86, the zone around 1.0370 to 1.0330 showed potential because of the other factors aligning with that level...trendlines etc. It's impossible to win every trade. All we can do as a retail trader is look for quality setups and control our risk!

Mr. Bantro1 sorry to ask u alot of questions hope u got a patience with me - what do you think about the difference between suport resistant and supply demand? - for the entry inside the s/d zone..how do you take a zone specifically? i mean from the opening/closing of the last candle before price move? the distal or proximal wick of some candles? thanks

--- 帖子 #103 ---
There's a big difference between the two. Most turning points on a chart (if you look back far enough) happen because of a prior supply/demand dynamic or a major fib level. Once price returns to that level, which at that point is no longer a fresh level, the odds of it holding are greatly diminished. That's the problem with trying to trade off traditional support/resistance levels especially if you're not aware of what created the support/resistance level in the first place. My entries are based on the top of the zone with a stop loss a few ticks below the zone. Each trader has to determine their own level of risk...if a zone is wide, maybe placing a SL halfway into it. If a zone holds a major fib retrace level inside it, I will place my entry at that fib level with my SL a few ticks below the zone. Hope this helps...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
You helps me alot - i am looking the post #85 again.. in the chart there are several things that come into my mind: 1. the price already broke the trend line 2. the demand zone already tested once before so..isnt it unsave to buy?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
You're right about the demand zone having a prior test. So on the next test one can expect price to move deeper into the zone. But the 76.4% retrace had not been tested before. And when there was a clear rejection off the 76.4% "long-term" fib retrace and huge volume driving price to that level with down volume falling off dramatically, showed a level that should hold. Actually if you step back to the 240 min chart, there is a down trendline that crosses the 76.4% level...all inside the demand zone. Look at the second chart on post # 88.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
OK. Now u have 2 demand and 1 supply level. I am irritated by the little one in between. Why is this a demand zone? In case that price reaches the little demand zone in between, you consider to buy. Do you think the supply level holds again? is this a "take profit" level?

Audusd:

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Apfelsaft: If that small zone irritates you then don't pay any attention to it. Price spent a short time at that level before moving higher on higher volume so I consider that a short-term zone to be aware of. Is that a major turning point...no! But it could be a speed bump to price action.

bantro thanks for this thread its very interesting. if you dont mind answering to my questions as well: 1. as i can see you only trade the S&amp;D in higher Timeframes. Does this means that S&amp;D system is not "working" in lower TFs like 30M, 15M, 5M etc? 2. What about if on a Daily chart you see that price is reaching a Supply zone but in 60min is reaching a demand zone. Which zone got priority? Higher or Lower timeframe? Thanks PS. I ve only read the first two pages of your thread and left the rest for later on so excuse if my questions have already answered

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Athan00, Don't mind at all. Thanks for stopping by. S/D zones are in and work in all timeframes. The longer timeframes definitely take priority. Always be aware of the longer term S/D zones and major fib levels. For example, be careful taking trades from short term demand zones into higher timeframe supply (and short term supply zones into longer term demand). Lower timeframe S/D zones can work very well for scalp trades and for riding price action into the priority zones. Once a longer term zone is identified, drop to a lower timeframe to help define the zone.

bantro1, gotta say, great job on allowing FF members to get a perspective of the markets through your technical analysis. I'm overly impressed by your approach and how you combine market waves, fib levels and S/D zones to look for great trade setups. It's always important to consider the risk/reward proposition when looking at opportunities...probably most important aspect to a trade plan allowing one to preserve capital and grow the account. Thanks for the Gold tip this morning!! I was able to check the setup on my mobile app (AvaFX) and profited from that opportunity. Keep up the awesome work! P.S. you mentioned in a post early on you've been trading a very long time. How long have you been participating in the markets using this approach?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
dcabfx, Thanks for the kind words. Glad you stopped by. I have been trading this way for only about two years. Up until that time, I relied on the all the classic indicators and was never happy with my results.

Bantro: I missed GBP/USD for 5 Pips - shake hands! Question: 1. When you setup your Demand/Supply Zones in 1H Chart. Do you zoom into 15 min. Chart to search for D/S in that area for exact entry ? 2. When D/S is near Fib Level, do you enter at Fiblevel or defined D/S 3. Do you hedge positions?

Tilf: I certainly understand that trading can be stressful. What really has helped me is having very definable risk/reward parameters and not entering trades when the risk is too high.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Apfelsaft: Yes I always try and look at the bigger picture first. when I see a possible setup on a higher timeframe, I drop down to the lower timeframes and try to further define the S/D zones and typically will use the 5 min or 15 min for picking the entry. When Fibs don't line up exactly with S/D zones I usually will favor the S/D zone. Look at post # 143. I thought that price would spike down and touch the top of the demand zone. Sometimes I will hedge a position. When I do, I usually select a Bull Spread on the Nadex platform. I will take a Bull Spread position opposite to my futures or forex trade. When it's setup properly it's very cheap insurance! You can you hedge off the trade (if it moves against you) and you don't have to set a hard stop loss. I will try and find time to post a setup using one of these.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
dcabfx: Good job defining that demand zone on your chart. looks like the way I would have drawn it. Feel free to post your charts as well.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Bantro1 I actually wanted to ask you about the risk/reward parameter. How exactly you define risk? On a high level, it would be the risk you take on the trade (Entry - stop loss), say 30 pips. However, how do you assess risk in terms of probability (lower probability = higher risk). There are a lot of set ups obviously, most work and some may not work as you know. So how would assess the probabilities? As mentioned by you, confluent factors add to the probability, and volume could filter out some low probability trades for you. Am I right, or is there more in your assessment? Thanks in advance. Have a great day

--- 帖子 #152 ---
David1234, Sorry, I overlooked your question. Volume can be an important part of the evaluation of a trade. Volume equals market activity.... specifically professional trading! It's the professional traders that move the different markets, so being able to recognize when they are active can help put probabilities on your side. The study of volume is really called: Volume Spread Analysis (VSA). It combines volume with the Spread of the candle relative to surrounding price action to give clues to where price may be heading next. Look at post # 147. Huge volume spikes should set off the retail trader's radar. A lot of times they signal the beginning of the change in direction. You see them a lot at turning points. The huge up volume spike with a wide spread up candle I have circled shows the professional traders starting to distribute their holdings and a few candles later, the market reverses! Ideally what I'm looking for, is higher volume as price moves into an area of interest and then to see that volume fall off in the area of interest! When I have time I will go a little deeper into this.

Hi Bantro, Thanks for ur reply something i dont really understand, y does a strong bullish candle with a strong buying volume bar, means that price is going to fall off after that? shouldnt a strong buying volume bar mean that theres great buying pressure? thus price is going to move higher? and lets say we are approaching a supply level with a big bull candle, do we wan to see a big buying volume bar or a big selling volume bar? vice versa when approaching a demand level with a big bear candle, do we want to see a big selling volume bar or a big buying volume bar? Thanks for ur time!

Thanks a lot for your reply and illustration through a chart! Much appreciated. Also, thanks for the useful tip on not including the wicks . I agree regarding not using used up zone. I have three categories - Fresh zone, Unfresh zone and used up zone. Fresh zone is when it has not been tested. Unfresh zone is either when it is tested once, or in the past market has reacted at that level. Used up zone is greater than 1 retest. I always have a text in each zone, e.g. Used up zone, supply exceeds demand, DO NOT BUY HERE. I had a tendency to follow the market, i.e. buy when it breaks key levels or sometimes I used to buy because I felt it would break a resistance. Thus, I always mention what I shouldn't do because the probability of losing is high at that point. Thanks again for your reply .

--- 帖子 #177 ---
david1234: Those are good questions you are asking. High relative volume bars appear in all areas of the chart. When you see one though, your trading radar needs to be on high alert because it's a sign that professional money has come into the market! High volume can mean different things depending upon where it's at! For example, If you see a ultra-high volume up bar after PA has already made a move up, then professional money is starting to distribute their holdings and are selling into retail traders buying. And when you see an ultra high volume down bar after price has already made a move down, then it is a sign that the professional traders are starting to accumulate (buy) into retail traders selling. When high volume bars appear after a reversal in PA or when price is breaking out of an area of consolidation, then that's an indication that the move should continue in that direction. more on this later...

bantro1, Are you with Mirus Futures as well? Do you only trade futures or are you also in the SPOT market? Its extremely tough for SPOT market participants to use Volume as an accurate tool as the feed is not accurate in itself. Have you heard or come across anything to help us SPOT market account holders? dcabfx

--- 帖子 #179 ---
dcabfx: Yes, I use Mirus for my futures trading and FXCM for my spot forex. You're right about the spot volume. Futures trading is more highly regulated and the volume more accurate and dependable. I still integrate spot volume into my decision making process when trading crosses.

Bantro1, I have a quick question. This is relating to the third Gold chart (60 min) you've posted. You have drawn two short term supply zone. One is named short term supply, and the other one is unnamed and is quite small. The question is relating to that small supply zone. Just want to know why you drew it there and not 2-3 candles before the move (origin). If you notice, your supply starts at a small bull candle, I was wondering what made you not choose supply starting from 2 candles before that.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Here's the chart showing what I am asking. The black boxes are where you drew the supply. Would it be wrong the way I drew it? I have seen sam seiden's video and the whole rocky's thread. I think they concentrated more on the origin of a move. Do let me know. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
WOW, after 3 years on and off of trying unsucessfully to get S&amp;R and lagging indicators work for me, i think i can almost see the light. Spent the last week going over Sam's vids, and many of this threads and Rocky's posts. I even took a successful trade or two based on these ideas....brilliant! Just wish i understood the correlation with volume better (guess i'll just have to keep studying). Here's a trade which i took with original TP at the 38.2 Fib, but i chickened out and closed out the trade for a small win after the 1H bar closed. What i probably should have done is just tightened my stop to B/E and seen it through.... i would have made it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Bantro: Post 184 Why isn't the 50% Fib. the Demand Zone? I see a long bull engulf. candle there?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Apfelsaft, 1. When you have a true imbalance in order flow, you're not going to see long bottom wicks on the candle in question. 2. The reason you have PA stalling is due to confluent factors. A 50% fib retrace level that happens to align to the bottom trend channel line. 3. My expectation is for PA to move lower and test the 61.8% level/ 261.8% fib extension from the 1,2,3 swing. I personally look for confluence when looking for potential trade setups: Trend channels/ trend lines Fib retrace/ ext levels supply/ demand zone ....and volume ( when and if PA reaches my area of interest). The reason I have question marks on my charts is because I don't control PA....the professional traders do. Hope this is helpful.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks for your feedback bantro. I thought one must mark the beginning of the move and not the beginning of the thrust. All clear now. Sorry to bother you with so many questions, but as I was analysing, I came across one issue. The issue is that in an UPTREND, supply zones are violated quite easily and vice-versa in a downtrend. So when I take a short at supply zones on dipping volume, the market does not reverse a lot and passes straight through it. Do you take into account the trend direction before trading a zone? IF you do so, then how do you determine a trend and trend reversal. Thanks.

Sell signal was the supply zone. Buy signal or my target is based on the nearest demand zone. In this case, me and bantro exit the trade using the same demand zone. Except he trades futures and I trade spot (which I hate now!)

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Apfelsaft: There is a nice demand zone sitting around the 132.00 level that also is close to the 76.4 retrace. That's assuming PA starts moving down from the current level. If not, the fibs will need to be redrawn.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
nice1 Tilf, I didn't even see that gold entry until you just mentioned it. i'm starting to like this system :-) i wonder what the win percentage on this system is.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I have added my own filters to this system to make it better. I try and take just one trade out of many markets. Unbelievable if i tell you, my win ratio has been 100% on about 10 trades I've taken! All thanks to bantro, rocky and sam seiden. You just need to know volume analysis very well and a little bit of observation power + Elliott Wave. Elliott wave is the least preferred filter for me. That said, I already have about 10 years experience in this market. Always look for a system that fits your personality. My personal preference is quick trades, rather than holding on too long on a trade. I do not have the patience to wait 5 days or 1 month on just one trade. Stress is also a consideration if you think of it. Too much stress for just a little more extra money may not be worth it. I write down every day on a piece of paper certain things I need to do before trading. It sounds really silly to some people but it keeps me focused I write the following: 1) Take care of your losses, and profits will take care of itself. 2) Do not worry if you miss a very good trade today, you will die one day but markets are eternal. 3) No matter how sure you are, do not risk more than 1% of your account. 4) Once you have a profitable trade in a day, tear this paper and switch off your laptop. 5) If you have a loss today, tear this paper and switch off your laptop, this system will work some other day and you will recover. 6) One trade at a time, forget all the previous trades. This exercise is quite helpful if you want to stay focused Added on edit: You might wonder why I wrote all this, It is just to illustrate that a good system alone is not sufficient, even if the win ratio is 100%. There is a lot to trading than just good systems. You will find 100's of set ups daily using this system, but to choose which set up is worth it requires a lot of focus.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
incredible!! , i've been trying to learn trading the markets on and off for over 5 years and this is the first thing that has ever worked for me. I'm about half way thru the Rocky thread, watched some of Sams videos, and read this thread front to back (along with heaps of other stuff on VSA i've watched &amp; read). I don't really know much about Elliot wave (other than the simple concepts of 12345ABC), and i still struggle to see how Rocky organizes his fib extensions to find high probability zones, but i do recognize the S&amp;D zones on the chart and am starting to get a better grasp of how volume can reveal possible reversals. I've read quite a bit on trading psychology as well, and i like your focus list, looks like you're in the 'zone' :-)

--- 帖子 #218 ---
IMHO, extensions can be left aside if you struggle with it. Guess what, I've struggled with it too at times. You just need to know 12345ABC in the elliott wave, and if you can find some simple patterns, it really guides in holding trades longer. But again, it is not absolutely important I would say. S/D zones and volume is paramount and you do not need anything else. I generally analyse volume differently from VSA, like trying find out what story market is telling me at each candle. I read a lot of comments on this thread regarding volume, there is no perfect way, but I will try and find out time to illustrate how I see volumes and use it for my trades.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
My volume analysis. Hope this stuff helps anyone. Sorry to hijack your thread bantro!! It is the 15 min EURUSD spot chart for the day ..... Candle 1: Bull candle, Green volume(higher than previous) after a steady consolidation. Indicates buyers are interested to push it up Candle 2: Market moves higher after buying interest, but here comes the first strong looking bear candle, but wait the volume is RED (lesser than previous bull candle). Sell interest is there but not much to push it too low. Candle 3: Bullish looking candle, GREEN volume, after a steady consolidation. Tells me buyers are still ready to push it further (remember sellers were not interest previously!!). Candle 4: Same as 3, steady consolidation and then a bull candle on green volumes Candle 5: Market goes up as buyers push it. This is a doji but the close was minorly bullish (close&gt;open price). But look at the volume, its RED. First sign of dis-interest in taking higher. This is not THE reversal signal, I need more candles to claim a reversal Candle 6: Arrival of late buyers after dis-interest. Green volumes, bullish candle .... hmmm still some dancing left. Candle 7: Ahh doji, dis-interest, you are here again! Same as Candle 5 explanation. Candle 8: High alert moment for me. Market in the supply zone, bear candle, Large green volume. All this is happening after late buyers have come in!! This only means one thing - Reversal is nearing/happening. Candle 9: Here comes the final confirmation. Look at this small bull candle, and look at the volume ...RED and pathetically low. No one is interested to take this up any more. The volume, look at it ...literally so low! This is going down baby. Candle 10: Proof that volume can help you trade better Green volume, bear candle, reverse the story I might sound like too silly after you read the above explanation, but silly me is helping me understand the story that market is trying to tell. DYODD and all that because this is NOT perfect. A weird news around the world can send the markets through the roof, but on the brighter side you would have a new demand zone to profit from! What is my volume analysis telling me right now for EURUSD? It is expected to test 1.3507 - 1.3513 buy zone as there is little buying interest at the moment, and sellers are getting restless. Let's see, not trading it anyways!

Fxbeast, Thanks for stopping by. Curious about your comment.....the way I look at this is, if you don't understand or consider VSA, then you are putting yourself at a serious disadvantage! whenever a retail trader enters the market, that trader has decided to engage in a battle with some of the sharpest minds on this planet! Professional traders love to transfer account balances from the uninformed to their accounts. And to not want to try and use every advantage available is, in my humble opinion, a mistake.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
hey RabbitWolf, what i did was go to Mirus Futures and open up a demo account (for now). Its not the same as the spot market which has no real volume data, but the futures and spot market are 'highly' correlated. Or you could use Metatrader, which i think has a tick volume indicator (not sure, maybe someone else here could clarify). All the best.

This is a short trade I took on the Nadex platform at the beginning of last week. I shorted 5 binary contracts with a weekly expiration. I took this trade because the Pound Futures had reached what I considered a HPT (high probability trade) setup. By choosing a weekly expiration, I had several days for the trade to move in my favor. The second chart shows my trade closing with a profit target set a $4 (sold at $50, bought back at $4). These are great options to use when pinpointing entries is a concern!

Got into the trade right now. Price moved slow back to the area of interest. Because of that I think that this position is little bit risky

apfelsaft, Post # 303 shows PA moving into a trendline on decreasing volume. #304 Shows PA moving into a SZ on decreasing volume. Show me your entry and exit parameters on either chart and I'll be glad to offer feedback! You're showing an hourly chart here! Both show a divergence between PA and volume. When PA enters areas of interest, I usually drop down to a 15 or a 10 min chart to look closely at volume.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Post #304 update: stoped out I consider to re-enter the trade when prive moved below 157.31. I would expect a move down to 155.45 (DZ created on 9.10.2013).

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Unfortunately I missed that trade yesterday

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Bantro 1: #301 is a great example!! thanks! dcbafx: which currancy pair do you spot in that particular chart above?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Apfelsaft, that chart was 6C futures chart (Canadian Dollar vs US). I've been anaylzing futures charts for its PA and volume. Combining that analysis with Spot is a good routine for me. If you're understanding volume and VSA, use the futures charts, they will provide clues in tracking the institutional market participation.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
you're posts have been an invaluable help in starting to turn my trading around (along with Rocky's thread and Sam's vids), and i've also been reading everything i can get my hands on regarding VSA, including VSA_basics (Karthic Marar) and "Master the Markets" Tom Williams. I'm still trying to absorb all the material, but what i seem most comfortable looking for is: 1.) Declining volume on a higher TF as price approaches an area of interest 2.) A reversal candle on the corresponding lower TF to confirm the higher TF trade 3.) "No Supply" and "No Demand" candles and 4.) possible areas of accumulation/distribution. Are there other specific VSA formations that i should become accustomed to seeing and recognizing, and is there any specific reading on VSA that you would recommend? regards, anton.

Hello, good strategy i have 1 stupid question. how create demand zone? this is indicator? or how to work? thank you

--- 帖子 #314 ---
USD/CAD or 6C is setting up for potential trade. Watch 15/30 min TF for volume going into Asian Session. bantro1 has posted a good view on this. Here's my outlook on the GBP/USD in Spot FX. I'll be watching the futures 6B for a VSA setup. 4HR and 1HR respectively. From the FIB studies, we're seeing a 78.6 retracement and 197 extension in the area. Good to see this confluence.

dvejn, Welcome to my thread. Supply and Demand zones are created when there is an imbalance in order flow created by professional buying or selling. These are areas that can provide trading opportunities when price action revisits them. Not an indicator, we draw them on the chart ourselves.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Can you post a picture, to know how to draw a zone? too do not understand. How do I know the big boys? volume 3000 + in 5 m tf? Please clear instructions. this is my first experience. thank you for your reply many green pips

Deitreider and Twinklestars, Appreciate the comments!

Dvejn, I only will consider entering trades when the risk is low. For example, look at the 5 min Euro chart above. If I get the proper VSA setup when PA enters the demand zone, I will be looking for an entry at the 50 % fib retrace and will have my SL sitting just below the zone around .3427. As far as the 'reward' side, I would be looking for 20-30 tics on this particular setup. ...so a 12 tic SL and a 20-30 tic profit target.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Yen Futures: PA is approaching Daily Demand that aligns with the 76.4% retrace level.

Very similar setup on Gold as well:

Couldnt quite find where to put this indicator but I hope people find it. Its a simple news indicator, when placed on any currency pair it shows the news events just for that pair so its easy to spot high impact news. Tells time, and forecast and the priority status which can also be changed and altered in the inputs tab of the indicator. This was not created by myself I found it in another forum but thought it would be nice for people to use. It is 2 files the first goes in the indicator of the data folder and the second goes into the libraries folder which is a dll. Hope you enjoy the indicator.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Ok, I'm back. Been working more with options (instead of trading futures). Buying puts and calls with the goal of capturing larger moves. I have been working on a new strategy for quite a while. Trading from a supply/demand strategy is effective...but only if one is able to recognize the proper levels. If you're trading futures, the mistakes can be costly. What I've been working on is a streamlined, more simplistic approach to identifying high-probability turning points and entering trades where exact pin-point entries are less important. I am going to start posting some charts as I have time. I will not be showing the exact strategy right away. At some time in the future I will. Right now I am continuing to refine and back test.

This is a good way to enter positions while putting time on your side. As with all option contracts, binary options give the flexibility of picking different expiration times...up to weekly. yesterday, when the Pound trade reached my area of interest, I picked an 11 am expiration expiring this morning. That gave my trade all evening and overnight to move in my favor...with no stop loss and limited risk. As long as the trade is above the strike at expiration, I win. Some would question the risk reward parameters but I feel it is justified when looking at higher-probability trades.

Refer to Post # 375: Same drawing here with the upper small supply area removed. This is a reminder that the retail trader has absolutely zero control of price movements. Professional institutional traders dictate where price will go. Identifying price levels where professional money is interested in returning and then trading in the same direction should be the retail trader's goal.

When Institutional traders decide to step in and move a particular market, they do so carefully. No sense in trying to drive prices up if there is still selling pressure. That is why they test for selling pressure. There are numerous institutional firms at work in any single market or instrument and they also compete against each other. That's why you see retests of previous highs and lows. Until there is lack of selling pressure, the professional traders will not drive prices up. The same is true in reverse when trying to move prices lower.

Big down move yesterday with the US Indices. Direct result of US non-farm payrolls. Even though job creation last month beat estimates and the unemployment rate ticked down, apparently wall street viewed that as negative news because of the increased possibility of the Fed being more likely to raise interest rates sooner than later. Non-farm payrolls are always a wild card and can screw up a chart pretty quickly (referring to post # 386). The following two charts show some of the things i'm looking for when considering an intraday trade setup.

I'll personally be watching for the reaction to the markets this afternoon when Janet Yellen (Fed) makes her remarks about their intentions to raise US interest rates. If the word 'patient' is removed, then the possibility of an interest rate increase is close (this summer). If this happens, the US Dollar should continue to strengthen. If they leave the word 'patient' in their statement, it will be seen as a negative for the US economy and the Dollar should pullback.

bantro1 Nice pick on the brakes, demand still present, and secondary higher mover into Supply.. Like the Volume analysis and context of what volume is doing at a given S/D level. For me a large range up candle into Supply followed by a strong reversal, range, with larger volume than the preceding up volume.. All happening inside Supply (key for me) Funny how many discount the use of Volume in FX...I am similar to yours but tend to view it more contextually.. relating to over all price movement.

Was away from the computer at market close. Came within a pip of hitting target # 2. Lowered the stop and will see what happens Sunday afternoon. Risk management is really the key to winning at this trading game. Once you enter a trade, you lose all control over how the market moves. All we...as retail traders control is where we enter and where we decide to exit! If one can pick winning setups consistently, size will take care of itself. Any given market is a complex, always changing fluid environment that is controlled by powers (Institutions, Fund Managers, Hedge Funds) way above the mere mortals (retail traders)! The best chance of success for us lowly beings is in trying to understand and trade in harmony with the Alpha dogs! The best and really...only consistent approach I (as a humble lowly trader seeking enlightenment on this complex journey) have found, is in learning to read volume. Because volume is the footprint that gives clues to where markets are going next. Not lagging indicators...but forward looking. But the ability to extract money from the computer screen...from anywhere in the world...with no boss...and minimal overhead...with unlimited earning potential is the common glue that keeps us coming back for more. I can't think of many goals more worthy and challenging! When it comes down to it, every time a trader presses the buy/sell button, that trader has entered combat! You think I'm kidding? At that point, the lowly retail trader has chosen to engage minds with some of the sharpest people on the planet (if it were easy...everybody would be doing this and saying '*&amp;@#$' to their bosses) Remember this....every time you have a winning trade, some poor sap...somewhere in the world, just lost money! And every time you have a losing trade...someone is laughing at your poor trading skills as they transfer your money into their account! That's just the hard cold facts of the serious game...you have wondered into.

Audusd: This pair has a lot of confluence around the .7612 area. Two fib studies sit right on top of a fresh demand zone. When PA reaches this area, if I'm in front of the screen, I will drop down to the 5 min. chart to observe volume before making a decision to go long. I used to place limit orders right at the start of these supply/demand zones with my SL right outside the other side of the zone. But my SL was getting hit more than I liked. Now I feel the better...safer approach is to wait for price action to arrive at a zone that I'm interested in and study the volume behavior before entering a trade. After all, remember who drives the market...professional money. If they have no intention of turning price at any particular zone, then my little rectangles certainly won't stop price! Markets move strictly based on order flow. Professional traders move price from one large block of unfilled orders to the next. These zones represent unfilled orders waiting to be filled. Now occasionally, economic data will miss or exceed expectations...or the Fed will release comments that cause high volatility. But for the most part, price is heading to where the orders sit unfilled. And the best way to track that is in learning to read the volume of the traders that control price. Because probably 80% of the volume seen on the charts is not created by the retail traders. It is created by professional traders (major banks), fund managers and hedge funds. Especially when you seen the big spikes....this is created by one or more professional groups stepping in.

For those interested in what Winston Reed was referring to, go back and look at post # 43. I make a couple suggestions for resources that will definitely be worth anyone's time that is really interested in learning to view the markets as a professional and to trade the way institutional traders trade (especially Rocky's blog). Good Luck!

Hello Bantro1, I followed along with this action on ES today. Good to see my evaluation jives with yours. May I ask what platformbrokerage you're using? I am demoing ninjatrader. I also have a TOS platform with TD Ameritrade but ninjatrader is much easier to use. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Winston Reed, I've been using ninjatrader for a few years and it's my preferred charting software. I have my futures acct at Mirus. I'm pleased with them for the most part. I also use OptionsHouse (formerly TradeMonster) for my options trading. I also use a third party money management app from Indicator Warehouse called 'Trail Blazer'. It is a great addition to day trading that gives a huge amount of flexibility in managing trades and it works seamlessly with NT.

Winston Reed: I didn't have any chart time this morning. I'll try and look at your setup later tonight.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Refer to post 512: Winston Reed, I would not have taken this trade based on the volume profile on my preferred 5 min. chart that I personally like to use for pinpointing entries. But if you evaluate the 15 min. chart, a more clear, favorable picture unfolds. This timeframe will work before market open but allows too much price movement for my taste when looking for detailed volume clues after market open (morning session).

Hey Bantro,, Question &gt;&gt; Looks like you use your FIBs in relation to the the DBR or RBD patterns.. Let me explain..Post #532.. On a RBD the initial FIB line would start around 1.2304 @ O%.. then move to 1.2086 @ 100%.. Then looking for PA at various levels for conformation .. ( 1 of many peaces to the puzzle ) The use of trend lines ( I do the same for the trend lines ) shades of Rocky he like Andrews Pitch Adding your Volume analysis .. What volume is doing at a given level ( Supply or Demand ) Just some observations. Most excellent thread !!! TSD

Sorry if the graphic sucks. This thread is recommended by TraderinSD with regards to analysis on volume and sup/dem zones So I entered EU short 2 days back. Reason is because price enter D1 fresh supply and checking the H1 tf, volume is decreasing. comments and critics are welcome. Thank you.

Rocky, I'm honored that you stopped by my thread. Thanks for the comments and the chart post! It's only because of what I've learned from you that I decided to start this thread. I've told a lot of people about your skill as a trader and have suggested those seeking knowledge to read through your material!

Crude Futures: Price action is revisiting an area where the professional traders had started distributing. My expectation is for a move lower from these levels.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Update on Crude futures: My apologies...here is the current contract month chart. When I posted the above chart, crude was around 46.34. Look at the decreasing up volume as price moved deeper into the zone identified by the blue horizontal bands.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
60 min view. Distribution zone refined on smaller timeframe.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Thanks Bantro1, looks like you had a nice Crude Trade, good call. How's the Banking business? By now you should be owning it My trading is going well. I'm still winning about 50% of my trades and my Reward to risk is 2.4 to 1. I keep very tight stops on most instrument except Crude. I give myself a little more wiggle room with Crude. It can be a beast to trade at times. I like your charts, they have really good market structure, very easy to comprehend. Based on what I see you must be making money!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Rocky, I'm no longer working in that area. I actually went back to my previous business. It's great to have the ability to control my own schedule. I'm doing ok. Having the patience to sit on my hands and wait for the proper setups is still something I struggle with. I'm glad to see you resume posting.

Eurjpy: Price action has worked it's way back up into an area where the institutional traders started distributing heavily (as seen in the bottom 60 min chart). Look at the huge volume spike that preceded the big down move. My expectation is for a move lower from these levels. I will be watching the 5 min chart for entry clues for a short.

--- 帖子 #565 ---

Crude:

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Crude update: Target 1 hit....SL adjusted

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Crude update: Target 2 hit. +$300 on trade. Reasons why I entered this trade: 1. Ultra High volume bar. Any time I see one of these (on any timeframe and relative to surrounding volume) I sit up and take notice. Only professional traders create this amount of activity....and volume=activity. They also distribute their positions on up moves. So when one of these volume spikes appear...professional money has stepped in to take control. 2. My VSA software identified that bar as weakness. 3. When PA (price action) revisited that area, it did so on much lower volume....lack of interest in higher prices at that level. 4. Secondary weakness appeared in the form of an 'upthrust'.

Here's the same setup but coming out of a move lower: Big downward volume spike Price action revisits that area on much lower volume....,professional money not interested in moving the market lower at that time. A 'no supply' candle

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Now looking forward, what do we see? If you step back and examine the longer timeframe (60 min chart), Price action has moved up into a prior area of distribution by the professional traders and was rejected by an 'upthrust' candle. The 5 min is showing signs of weakness as well. Look at the up volume as price tries to reach the previous high. My expectation is for a move lower.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I was busy typing and missed this scalp entry...

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Glad I didn't take this trade a few minutes ago. Look at the volume spike underway. Highest volume of the day on a Friday afternoon.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Crude oil futures rollover today to the 12-15 contract. Since the crude futures close at 2:30 pm, That volume spike could very well have been long positions being liquidated.

Crude: I'll be looking for crude oil to move up from these levels.

Pound Futures: Looking at a potential short setup. Working off the highest volume candle of the day, I'm looking for an entry based on a successful test or a no demand setup.

Crude: Highest volume of the day just came into crude oil off the inventory report. Definitely buying on that volume spike. I will watch for a low volume pullback into that high volume bar.

SL raised to breakeven +1

--- 帖子 #602 ---
SL raised to +3 and then hit. +$130 on trade.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Crude: Normally a little more risk than I usually take on with the SL placement. Assuming this moves in my favor, I will be trimming the risk by moving my SL.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I chose the SL level because it is slightly below the upper level of the high volume bar and my gameplan for PA is that it will stay above this level.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Not a good sign on the 5 min with the candle circled...def some selling taking place. As long as the down volume stays low, I'll stay in this trade.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
This bar closed up on low relative volume...I'd like to see up volume start building soon on the 5 min

SL hit on 2nd contract. +$105 on trade. PA ran into the prior short term tops and fell back. Once my 1st profit target is hit, I don't like to give the money back. Sometimes I miss out on larger moves by having tight stops, but I'm more concerned with preserving capital. There's always another trade setup around the corner!

6B: If you'll notice the two highest volume spikes on this 60 min chart, you can see that is where price action changed direction. My expectation is for professional money to control price within this upper high volume zone and at some point next week, to move price back down to test the lower level high volume area.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Gbpusd: 3 min chart... Highest volume of the day showed up as price action entered the upper zone (60 min chart). assuming this scenerio occurs, I will consider a short entry if price breaks down below the newly formed volume spike and retests this area on low volume.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Gold: The professional traders just are active this morning! If this 60 min candle closes near the bottom, Gold will be moving lower. These 'shooting stars' or 'upthrusts' are designed to fool the retail traders who trade breakouts and catch the stops of those who are already short.
